<plain_text><page sequence="1">KHANTY COMMUNAL REINDEER SACRIFICE: BELIEF, SUBSISTENCE AND CULTURAL PERSISTENCE IN CONTEMPORARY SIBERIA ANDREW WIGET and OLGA BALALAEVA Abstract This paper provides a detailed description of the structure of communal reindeer sacri- fice [myr) among the eastern Khanty of Surgut region, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Russia, as witnessed by the authors in March 1992. The paper then demonstrates how the event structure of myr articulates with Khanty belief systems in order to enact its general function of insuring food and prosperity. The authors interpret several features of the sacrifice they witnessed as illustrating the adaptive nature of Khanty religious practice, especially in role-definition and activities of cul- tural specialists. Finally, the authors conclude that, despite a variety of pressures, Khanty commu- nal reindeer sacrifice persists because it continues to dramatize the core relationships which prevail in the Khanty world, soliciting from participants a recommitment to these beliefs and practices. The survival of indigenous religious practices in the North has become a critical issue, especially in ar- eas where intensive acculturation programs have combined with dramatic natural resource develop- ment. The situation is especially acute in the former Soviet Union, where these practices were histori- cally supported by deliberate persecution of native religious practitioners and restructuring of native economies. Soviet ethnographic literature often de- cried indigenous Siberian religious practice and pre- dicted their imminent demise. It was not uncommon, for example, to find statements like the following: Shamanism played an extremely negative role in the history of the Siberian peoples . . . the shamans were hand in glove with the exploiting ruling cliques of the indigenous populations. They caused enormous economic harm by constantly demanding blood sacrifices, hence, the slaughter of dogs, rein- deer and other livestock essential to the hunter. After the Soviet regime had been established, the shamans. . . . fiercely opposed the Soviet ad- ministrative organs ... It is obvious that neither the shamans nor any other exploiters were able to turn back the clock, and their influence did not last long. (Levin and Potapov 1964:10) Such statements were made by ethnographers who knew better, but who, in order to be published at all, were compelled to include such explicitly ideo- logical statements. The accompanying ethnographic descriptions were almost always written in the past tense. Such a mode of presentation obscured the real condition of Siberian traditional cultures. Re- cent post-Soviet work, both Russian and non-Rus- sian, describes a much more complex situation (Golovnev 1995; Pika 1999; Balzer 1999).

The expedi- tion was organized by O. Balalaeva, because of her experience on four previous expeditions to the area. On the initiative of our local Khanty host from the village of Russkinskiye, we were transported by helicopter to a reindeer camp near the upper Trom- Agan River, at the northernmost limit of eastern Khanty territory (Fig. 1). Several families were gath- ered together at this location, and more arrived dur- ing the afternoon of our appearance. We soon learned that the occasion of this gathering was a communal reindeer sacrifice (myr, in Khanty) to be held the following day at a sacred site approxi- mately six kilometers distance from the campsite. We were readily invited to participate. The circum- stance which made us privileged witnesses to an ex- traordinarily complex event also, however, limited the amount of information that could be gathered directly from our host. We have returned to the eastern Khanty region for fieldwork every summer since 1994, and have incorporated into the present Figure 1.

After establishing the historical and ethno- graphic context for our observations, the first section of this paper provides a detailed description of the structure of the communal reindeer sacrifice or myr we witnessed in March 1992. The second part of the paper demonstrates how the event structure of myr incorporates the Khanty belief system in order to express its general function of insuring food and prosperity. In the third section of the paper, we in- terpret several features of the sacrifice we witnessed as illustrating the adaptive nature of Khanty reli- gious practice, especially in role-definition and ac- tivities of cultural specialists. We conclude that despite the efforts of the Russian Orthodox Church - which in some areas has gained converts of varying degrees of allegiance, despite the sup- pression of native religion under the Soviets, and despite the pressures associated with petroleum ex- traction in the area, traditional Khanty beliefs and rituals still flourish, albeit adapted to new circum- stances. Historical and Ethnographic Background Among the Khanty The Khanty, called Ostyak in the pre-Soviet ethno- graphic literature, are a Finno-Ugric-speaking people numbering approximately 22,000, and one of the most numerous and widely dispersed of the 45 in- digenous peoples of the Russian North.1 Archaeolog- ical evidence indicates that they have occupied West Siberia for at least 3000 years, maybe longer, while linguistic data indicate that this region is part of the homeland of the proto-Uralic peoples, who include not only tribal peoples like the Khanty, Mansi and Nenets, but also Finns and Hungarians (Kosarev 1984; Chemyakin and Karacharov 1999). The 1989 census lists approximately 31,000 Ob'- Ugrians living in Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Ok- rug, both Mansi (8,461) and Khanty (22,521). The land is subarctic, boreal forest and bog, with an ele- vation between 25 m and 100 m above sea level. Three Khanty groups - northern, southern, and east- ern - can be distinguished by differences in dialect, subsistence patterns, and material culture. Northern Khanty live in the Beloyarsk and Salekhard regions. The southern Khanty were assimilated into Russian society by the middle of this century. The eastern Khanty occupy a basin drained by the middle stretch of the Ob' River and its tributaries. Archaeological data suggest that, at least since the early seventeenth century, Khanty have lived in widely scattered extended family settlements where they continue to use traditional family hunting terri- tories. Many are literate in Russian (some fluently bilingual), but prefer to speak Khanty. Although the Khanty subsistence economy has a strong hunting and fishing base, there are significant regional differ- ences (Fig. 1). In the north, along the lower Ob' River and on the northern side of the middle Ob' (Lyamin, Pirn, Trom-Agan Rivers), this pattern is complemented by reindeer herding. In the south, along Irtysh River, this pattern was historically com- plemented by agriculture. Only on the south side of the middle Ob' does a pure fishing-hunting econ- omy remain (Wiget 1999a). Khanty social organization is based on ex- tended families or patrilineages, with related lin- eages grouped into clans [tir, in Khanty). While the present settlement pattern has been influenced by migration and forced relocation within the Middle Ob' region (Martynova 1998), evidence from our fieldwork and the ethnographic record confirms that different Khanty clans claim traditional use rights to different tributaries of the Ob'. They do so in part because they believe their lineage was founded by divine ancestors who were also responsible for the creation of the river systems on which the majority of the clan lives. Most Khanty extended families live on traditional family hunting territories, pro- tected by family gods who are considered offspring of the lineage's founding deities. Khanty thus be- lieve that sacred power has been historically in- vested in both the landscape and the lineage (Balalaeva 1999). West Siberia today is the site of one of the world's most extensive petroleum deposits. The pro- cess of development began in the late 1960s with the first discoveries of oil. At that time, Surgut (Fig. 1) had less than 10,000 people (it did not receive city status until 1968). In the 1970s, geological work dominated the western part of the region, between Surgut and Khanty-Mansiysk, while the first pro- duction began in earnest in the eastern half of the region (Surgut to Nizhnevartovsk). By the late 1980s all but a few areas (Kazym River, Bolshoi Yugan River) had been seized for production by the Minis- try of Energy and the government oil monopoly. The region virtually supported a collapsing Soviet economy by providing a cheap domestic petroleum supply as well as petrodollars generated from ex- port. This period was marked both by the forcible relocation of Khanty families from their traditional family hunting territories and by the destruction of the natural resources of occupied family territories, also leading to resettlement. The result is that, after thousands of years of occupancy, today few subsis- tence-based Khanty family settlements survive on the Vakh, Agan, Salym, and Vas- Yugan Rivers, al- though these were all well-populated areas, rich in terms of traditional economy, thirty years ago. Other river systems like Pirn and Trom-Agan are heavily impacted and the Khanty living there have been</page><page sequence="4">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 85 marginalized. Only the Khanty families on Lyamin and Yugan River systems have been minimally im- pacted (Wiget and Balalaeva 1997, 1998; Wiget 1999b). The Khanty believe in a three-zone cosmos with this middle world existing between an upper, sky world and an underworld. Each of these zones is further divided into seven levels. The high god, Numi Torum, cannot be approached directly but only through addressing one or more of his seven sons and seven daughters, each of whom is patron of some dimension of the natural world: rivers, fish, animals. The youngest son, in his human incarna- tion, was elevated to the senior position among the sons, and in his animal incarnation became Bear, the master of the forest. As with many circumpolar peoples, a special Bear Festival is occasionally cele- brated to honor a bear that has been killed (Schmidt 1985). Khanty religious belief and practice have been affected by contemporary development. One Pirn River Khant told us how recent circumstances have affected the practice of communal sacrifice: There was a /un (spirit) on Bolshoi Pirn River [named] Pawt Iki. Nobody knows where he is now. There was a place there, where they gathered to- gether for myr for more than thirty years. There was an island there. When the oil people came and put a well there, this /un went away from this place. Nobody comes to this place now. Before that, the people did not go there because they were afraid of repressions. Then the young people did not go there because they did not think about the hitjs. Khanty animal sacrifice continues nevertheless, de- spite repression, destruction of sacred sites, and ac- culturative pressures. Indeed, the public sacrifice of individual reindeer for some "official" occasion and sanctioned by a Khanty head of family is now inter- preted by regional or okrug administrative officials as a sign of mutual goodwill and the vitality of Khanty culture. Such semi-official displays of rein- deer sacrifice raise a number of questions which cannot be addressed here (see Leete 1997, 1999). These quasi-official events, however, are different in kind from the communal sacrifice performed in pri- vate by the community for the community, which we were fortunate enough to witness. If, today, one asks why people continue to make sacrifices, very general responses are given. KK, a Pirn River Khant, observed that "they [/uns] make life for a man easier, in order to prolong life, they can help men to recover (from sickness), be- cause they will know that the man will also make yir for them." KK (initials have been used to protect the privacy of our sources) is the son of a shaman. His nearest neighbor is a shaman who has directed two myiis], and KK himself has organized a myr within the last three years. PK, a Bolshoi Yugan River Khant elder who is a recognized monteh-ko and arekhta-ko (storytelling and song specialist), also affirmed, "The people ask for happiness and prosperity."2 Historical Review of Khanty Reindeer Sacrifice The sacrifice of reindeer was recognized as a dis- tinctive Khanty cultural practice as early as the six- teenth century (Karjalainen 1995, 2:98). Since these earliest reports, it has become clear that Khanty a reindeer sacrifice is part of a larger complex of prac- tices revolving around the ritual killing of several kinds of animals, a tradition distinct from the set of practices known as the bear cult. A discussion of historical and structural relations between these two cultic traditions is beyond the scope of this paper.3 K. F. Karjalainen's principal fieldwork among the Khanty, the results of which were first pub- lished in the 1920s, dates from the turn of the last century (1899-1904) before the Khanty were sub- jected to the Soviet atheism campaigns and collec- tivization. He observed that Khanty distinguish between two types of animal sacrifice, "bloody" and "bloodless" (Karjalainen 1995, 2:107). Our fieldwork confirms that Khanty still employ these Khanty- language terms to categorically distinguish between two kinds of Khanty sacrifices that end in the con- sumption of food. Yir refers to "blood" sacrifices where blood is preserved and drunk, and some parts of the sacrificed animal are consumed raw. Pori is the Khanty term for "bloodless" sacrifice, where the meat of the sacrificed animal is boiled and eaten. Blood sacrifices can be organized individually or communally. Individual yir can be organized on the occasion of the birth of a child (Karjalainen 1995, 1:59) or at the time of burial for any person (Karjalainen 1995, 2:93). In a time of crisis, for in- stance when stricken with disease, a family may feel the need to make yir but lack the resources. In this case they can promise to make yir at a future date (Karjalainen 1995, 2:120). This practice of post- poning sacrifice does not apply for communal sacri- fices, which have a more or less fixed date and draw families from the whole region. Among the eastern Khanty, communal yir are known as myr. As early as the last century, Gondatti determined that sacrifices could be offered either regularly or occasionally: Sacrifices may be either occasional or regular. Occa- sional sacrifices depend on circumstantial reasons and the varying enthusiasm of the non-Christians. The latter [regular sacrifices] are obligatory and usu- ally done in spring before the beginning of fishing and in early autumn after fishing is over, late au- tumn before starting for winter hunting, then after</page><page sequence="5">86 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 coming back, and so on in other similar cases. (Gondatti 1888:10) While Karjalainen (1995, 2:120) remarks that some communal sacrifices have been held in the past in case of disease (perhaps epidemics), today most are made in association with the change of seasonal subsistence pattern historically identified by Gon- datti.4 In the historical period, Khanty are known to have sacrificed other animals besides reindeer, such as horses, cows, bulls, rams, and even roosters, (Kar- jalainen 1995, 2:101). The animals, however, pre- ferred for yir were reindeer and horses.5 The horse was the most valuable of the non-reindeer sacrifices, because it could be substituted for reindeer (though in 1995 at least one Pirn River Khant informed us that seven bottles of vodka may also be substituted for a reindeer). In 1998 plans were circulating among the Bolshoi Yugan River Khanty to gather money to buy a horse for sacrifice. Debates about the appropriateness of different kinds of sacrificial animals quickly elide into argu- ments over the functions and structures of animal sacrifice. Karjalainen argued that, "the sacrifice of the animal is represented primarily as the offering of a useful animal. It is natural that untamed ani- mals, forest animals and birds, even if they some- times could be killed for a spirit, nonetheless could not be sacrificed animals in the same sense as rein- deer, among the Khanty" (Karjalainen 1995, 2:103). Reindeer, for example, can also be sacrificed to pro- vide transport for the deceased (Karjalainen 1995, 1: 95). "Usefulness," however, can be understood in ways other than transport. Karjalainen speculated that: The spirit should be also offered food. Here meat al- ways played an important role among Ugrians, and that is why animal sacrifice easily gained the char- acter of food sacrifice, or feeding [the spirit or the dead] with food. Both aims can be met in contem- porary sacrifices, and sacrifice feast nowadays is probably more customary and a more important goal. (Karjalainen 1995, 2:103) However, because the production of edible food re- sults from the killing of game and fish as well as reindeer, by itself the production of edible food can- not account for the distinction made between the of- ferings of domestic and wild animals. The distinction, implicit in the two Khanty terms used regularly to describe these ritual killings, yir and pori, seems to be based on whether the production of edible food is the intended goal of the killing or a by-product of the killing. Karjalainen also uses the food/feasting dimension of sacrifice to distinguish between sacrifices of animals and "sacrifices of things," a categorization by means of which he ac- counts for the offering of the skins of animals not normally hunted for food but for fur (Karjalainen 1995, 2:103). Myr: Eastern Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice Organization of Myr How myr come to be held is complex. Our work confirms that Gondatti's 1888 observation about or- ganizing blood sacrifices, yir, remains true today: yir can be motivated by special circumstances or follow a seasonal pattern. We know from our own field- work that individual yir have been made by individ- uals at the beginning of hunting season and on the occasion of a family member's return from a long absence as, for example, at a hospital or boarding school. The same seems true for communal sacri- fices, myr. KK explained what had happened re- cently among the neighboring families on the Ai- Pim River: The first [of the recent] myi{s] was gathered by ZN. He was visited by something [a spirit]. It ordered him to gather people together for three ir?yr(s]. He had made two and he didn't do it the third time. Then, as a result, something happened bad with my head, and they [the spirits] jumped on to me. So I arranged the third one. The sacrifice we attended in late spring was the sea- sonal, communal sacrifice at the end of the winter season, before families returned to their summer houses. Khanty unable to attend these communal myr may make yir individually on their own hunt- ing territory prior to seasonal changes of residence associated with hunting, fishing, and reindeer herding. Once the decision has been made to conduct a myr, word must be communicated to the participat- ing families concerning the date and location of the event. The date of the event is communicated by sending to each of the participating households a small stick marked with a number of notches corre- sponding to the number of days remaining until the group should assemble. We have also heard of a knotted string or cord being distributed with one knot being unraveled each day until the day of as- sembly. The notched sticks must be brought by the participants to the place of sacrificing. The invita- tions go out from a local host who need not be a cultural specialist. The choice of location is often revealed in a dream to the chirta-ko (a Khanty cultural specialist, see below) or to the person moved to seek a myr. Usually these places have mythological significance. As KK remarked earlier, recently petroleum devel- opment activities have destroyed a number of sa- cred places where myr had been offered. Destroyed sites continue to be regarded as sacred places, but</page><page sequence="6">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 87 are no longer usable for ritual practices. It appears, however, that the significance of a place that has been destroyed can be transferred to a new location. This was the case with the site of the sacrifice re- ported here. In 1994, JS told us that the sacred place designated for the myr was named "The Place of the High Fir Tree" after a site further down river that had been destroyed by the construction of a road. The relationship of the newly-revealed site to the old site is unclear, nor do we know the extent or frequency of this practice, although we do know that this is not a unique instance. Day One: Petition and Song Pre-Ritual Social Activity Our helicopter landed in the late afternoon. Our lo- cal host introduced us to the elder, AM, who said the group was preparing for a reindeer sacrifice on the next day and that we were welcome to join them. This was the first we had heard about the event. The encampment consisted of three large canvas tipis [chum, in Russian), in front of which were a half dozen sleds, as well as two snowmo- biles, on which married women were seated and conversing. Some were also attending to young chil- dren playing in the immediate area. Others were ca- sually observing the young men, some of whom were their husbands, engaged in what was de- scribed to us as "Khanty Olympics." Over the next half-hour we observed the young men compete in a number of contests of strength and agility, including leaping from a standing position over a rope stretched at increasingly more difficult heights, at- tempting standing broad jumps across an increas- ingly greater number of reindeer sleds laid side by side, and attempting to sling their lassos, made of braided reindeer hide, over the tops of the four- meter-long poles used to drive the reindeer. After we had prepared and eaten our meal, and dark- ness had fallen, drumming and singing began in the host's tent and continued for most of the night. Having been deposited quite unexpectedly into a ritual context, and without any prior knowledge of eastern Khanty protocol, we waited for an invitation from our host, only to discover the next morning that our host had been expecting us to take the ini- tiative. Fly Agaric Shamanizing and Petitioning the Luijs The drumming and singing were part of the prepa- ratory rites for the sacrifice to take place the next day. According to KK, who has participated in a myr three times since 1990, divination rites with fly agaric mushrooms [Amanita muscaria; mukhomor, in Russian] customarily take place both before and after the sacrifice. These are led by the chirta-ko, an eastern Khanty cultural specialist. The role of the chirta-ko is characterized principally by the singing of spirit songs accompanied by drumming. Ac- cording to KK, ideally there ought to be seven fly agarics, which should be gathered in summer. It is necessary to prepare a table, laying out the fly aga- rics, bread, and food. The chirta-ko should eat all the mushrooms. KK described the divination that night as typi- cal. After the table is prepared, but before people eat, those present may ask questions. Typical ques- tions include: "If reindeer or people are sick, or there is no fishing or hunting luck, what should be done?" Other questions concern the community and how to resolve community problems. The main question asked when myr is held for the first time at a new place is the precise location at which to sac- rifice the reindeer. The old places having been spoiled, the people need guidance on locating a new place, where the sacrifice and offerings of skins and fabrics cannot be seen from the road. KK also added that the value of the divination depends upon taking the smallest fly agrarie mushroom in any stand of mushrooms; one must not gather the older ones "because old ones lie." The chirta-ko then eats all the mushrooms pre- sented. If, KK said, there happens to be a stronger shaman present who has not eaten the fly agarics, the effect of the mushroom may "jump" from the chirta-ko to the stronger shaman. KK reported that at the last myr he hosted, the chirta-ko ate three fly agarics, which were all that had been gathered, and waited to see if someone else would become af- fected. The power went around to several people, each of whom became red in the face, but each of them "refused it." One old man, however, sat there, tapping his head with his fingers, and when they gave him the drum he began to sing. Every chirta-ko has his own mushroom sha- manizing song. These songs (parjx arev, in Khanty) have a rhythmical structure similar to Khanty drink- ing songs [werem are*, in Khanty) These songs are understood as being spontaneous compositions. Ac- cording to KK, "each fly agaric song is different be- cause it is that particular fly agaric that gives the words to the shaman's song. The fly agaric knows itself. It's like a /urj." During the song, the shaman hears the answers to the question. He may also an- nounce that, because something good has happened to someone, that person should make a blood sacri- fice (yir). Day Two: Sacrifice Everyone was awakened around 6:00 A.M. by the sound of the reindeer herd, which, having returned from spending the night in the forest, was moving between the tents and pawing the snow. After</page><page sequence="7">88 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 eating the morning meal, the entire party, consisting of several extended families, left the encampment area around 10 o'clock and traveled to the sacred place in a caravan of nartés (sleds) drawn by either reindeer or snowmobiles. Altogether there were about sixty people: 25 men, 21 women, 12 children, and the visiting group of seven outsiders (three Americans, one British, and three Russians). Ac- cording to one of the elders, this was the first time such a sacrifice had ever been witnessed by outsid- ers, except for 12 years ago, when a Russian, raised among the Khanty, had been present. Gathering and Site Preparation Gathering and Gender Separation At the site, a bend on the frozen Trom-Agan River, the nartés and the women stayed on the west bank of the river while the men moved down onto the river to pre- pare the sacrifice site. The women were prohibited from coming onto the site any further than the cook- ing area. The prohibition of women from participat- ing in hunting rituals is common among Khanty as in many hunter-gatherer cultures (Karjalainen 1995, 2:120; Kulemzin 1976:35, 1984:95). Site Preparation The site was laid out on two axes (Fig. 2). One axis ran along the river between two activity sites, the tree-altar, and the fire. On the first axis, the large birch sapling cut for this purpose had been planted in the snow covering the river ice. It is not clear if setting up this birch sapling is viewed as mandatory. KK said that they had not put up a birch tree for the myr he organized on Pirn River, and attributed its absence to local variation ("be- cause on another river it's done differently"). At the base of this sapling was laid the altar table to pro- vide Torum with the goods and with his share of the ritual feast. Around this area the hunters gath- ered with the domestic reindeer that they used for transport. Opposite the altar a second activity area was established along this axis by digging a deep fire pit in the snow; the women and children were prohibited from passing beyond it. The second axis crossed the first, running from the far bank across the river through the tree-altar onto the near bank and into the forest. Extended into the forest, one end of this second axis terminated in the place for the final disposition of the offerings to the forest spirits and to Torum. Kindling the New Fire While the men finished es- tablishing the general plan of the site, several of them moved to a log, positioned earlier near the center of the site. A large square notch had been taken from the side of the log. Individual men took turns with a fire drill, the point of which was placed into the notch. Despite their diligent efforts, they were unable to kindle a fire this way. Finally, someone held a wooden match to the turning drill at the point of its contact with the tinder, and through this compromise a fire was started. Though the use of matches to kindle the fire was necessary in spite of the prohibition against it, the prohibition itself is more than a simple clinging to traditional means. This older way of kindling the new fire rep- resents the belief that fire is a living spirit in things, to be born or made manifest through the apparently spontaneous combustion of the fire drill. The Black Man While the New Fire was being kin- dled, other men dug a large fire pit in the snow, and carried to it firewood, a large kettle, and many small kettles. The women continued to quietly stand by or sit on the nartés, talking with each other, gossiping, nursing children, and paying no attention, perhaps deliberately, to this activity. At the same time other men were busy shaping sheet metal from a steel drum they had cut open into an anthropomorphic image. We were told this was The Black Man of Disease. This figure was erected on the west river bank, opposite an older figure of the same form and construction on the other bank. Altar Offerings On the altar were placed offerings of fabrics, a few canned meats, and money. These were carefully inspected and their relative value discussed. Some fabrics were discarded, however the principal of selection was not clear to us. Though fabrics, as indicated below, have symbolic value because of their color, patterned fabrics, usu- ally checkered patterns of red and white or black and white, were allowed to remain on the altar. All of the canned food presented for offering was per- mitted to remain, though a can of seafood presented by one of our company was not consumed during the feasting that followed. Whether this was a mat- ter of personal preference, or whether it was be- cause consuming fish was prohibited during this particular ritual was not clear. The Sacrifice Consecration and Petition At this point the eleven reindeer to be sacrificed were brought out from their place among the nartés behind the altar to the sacri- ficing place near the middle of the river. These rein- deer were supplied by each of the families participating in the sacrifice. The reindeer were po- sitioned in front of the men, who also lined them- selves up in uneven rows facing south toward the sun. (see Fig. 2). It was about 11:00 a.m. One man, who had directed the inspection of the altar offer- ings, stepped forward and, in a crying chant, began to lead the men in praying to Torum and to Kon Iki; occasionally they punctuated their prayers with the cry of "Wo-wo-wo." During the prayers, all the men bowed from their waist in the direction of the sun at least two dozen times, then each turned himself around clockwise once. This cycle was repeated</page><page sequence="8">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 89 Figure 2. Plan for Site of Communal Reindeer Sacrifice, upper Trom-Agan River, Surgut Region, Khanty-Mansi Autono- mous Okrug, March 1992. twice more for a total of three units of action. At the end of the third turnaround, all knelt on one knee and touched their foreheads to the snow. Both the bowing from the waist and the genuflection proba- bly reflect the influence of Orthodox ritual; the gen- uflection is an exact replication of the Orthodox zemnoi poklon or "bow to the earth." The women had been watching the activity from their place on the other side of the fire, some distance away. At the call to prayer they too formed loose ranks, in their separate area, and with the older women in front, participating in the same way as the men. Lassoing After the prayers to Torum and Kon Iki led by the multeh-ko [a Khanty cultural specialist who functions as manager of the ritual], several of the younger men spent time attempting to lasso the tops of saplings near the river bank. Khanty reindeer herders use lassos [arkan, in Khanty) braided from strips of reindeer hide to catch deer from the herd when they want to harness them for transport. It is a skill they practice competitively for pleasure by trying to lasso the tops of the long poles they use to drive reindeer with. We were told that this lassoing is to bring them good luck in the actual catching of reindeer. Sacrifice and Butchering Eleven reindeer were sac- rificed. Of the eleven, ten had white or white and red cloths tied to their necks, and one had a black cloth. The deer were sacrificed quickly and cleanly. One man approached the deer from the right front, with his left hand resting gently on the deer's muz- zle and his right hand holding the cloth tied around its neck. A second man approached from the right rear and stunned the deer with a single swift blow with the butt of an axe head to the top of the skull between the antlers. The deer dropped heavily, and a third man killed each with a single, clean stab to the heart with a long, thin knife.</page><page sequence="9">90 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 The colors of the cloths tied to the reindeer are of ancient and fundamental significance. White is associated with the sky world, black with the un- derworld, and red with the earth-surface world. Kar- jalainen has made some general observations about the salient characteristics of animals sacrificed: that the sex of the animal sacrificed should be the same as that of the spirit to whom it was offered; that color was an important factor in identifying animals to be sacrificed; and that the number of animals sac- rificed in communal sacrifices was usually three or seven (Karjalainen 1995, 1:97-98). PK observed that on Yugan "the people [not the multeh-ko] define for themselves how many reindeer they would give to whom; the multeh-ko is [only] the one who calls the god." KK confirmed that in his area, north of the Ob', "the multeh-ko de- termines how many deer are to be sacrificed and to whom [which /un]." KK went into some detail about how reindeer were sacrificed in the three myr he recently attended, one of which he hosted. In his mind, there is a regularity to the sequence of the of- ferings. The multeh-ko determines how many deer and to whom they are sacrificed. If there are many, there can be as many as three to each. If there are few, perhaps two to one of the iki [/uns] and one each for the rest. If they have white reindeer bulls, they should be sacrificed to the first two. The sequence is thus: First reindeer is for Grandfather [Torum, Numing Iki]. Second is for Kon Iki. Third is for Chorny Iki [The Black Man- puixt iki; Kul - Kyq ftin]. Fourth is for Muix Imi [Muix Aqki]. Fifth is for Tils (Moon) and Kotet (Sun). Sixth is for Kazym Imi. Seventh is for Woy Ort Iki, Protector and Distrib- utor of Fish, Animals, and Birds (one of Kon Iki's brothers) Eighth is for Agan, Trom-Agan, Pirn, and Lyamin river spirits. (Everybody can bring their reindeer separately to these four /izrjs. If someone wants to sacrifice to Agan, so he does to Agan, or to Pirn, or to both; there are many variations possible here.) Ninth is for Pupit Kon [Great Bear, also brother to Kon Iki]. After providing this listing, KK also observed that "a reindeer for Nom Imi is usually offered after sac- rifices have been made to the first three or four male gods. She is their mother, wife of the grandfather." This would mean that her sacrifice is made at the place in the original sequence occupied by Muix Imi [Muix Arjki]. After the animals were killed, two-man teams set to skinning each animal, including the skull, and butchering them. They were careful not to spill blood on the snow. The head was skinned carefully and the lower jaw removed and reserved. The thigh bones and the upper muscle below the ham were also separated and reserved from the rest of the butchered meat. Working quickly and skillfully as teams, this process took no more than ten minutes for each animal, and all the animals thus prepared in about twenty minutes. During the course of the butchering, two animals were discovered to have been pregnant; the foetuses were later carefully bur- ied in the snow on the river. KK said that Khanty believe this to be an especially valuable offering: "If a female reindeer is killed with a small one inside, it is considered to be two reindeer." Feeding the Birch and the Black Man During the butchering, small bits of meat were stuck on branches of the birch sapling fixed in the snow near the altar. Likewise, bits of meat and blood were thrown at the sheet metal image of the Black Man of Disease. BN, a Trom-Agan River Khant, said in 1994 that Chorny Iki has a metal hat and metal clothes. When we inquired about the practice of attaching bits of meat to the metal image, KK responded that this was done to prevent disease. They set up the metal figure because he has such clothes (metal) and he has such a sharp-pointed hat; such is his uniform. They throw meat because they always cut a reindeer for him and pray to him; he was also invited. It depends on Chorny Iki whether your life will be prolonged. In childhood, you get a road, but very often people reach only the middle of this road, because of drinking or sickness. When people are born they already have roads. In earlier times, the old people lived for a long time. The chirta-ku helped a little bit. It is when Torum can't do anything, then the chirta-ku applies to Chorny Iki. Chorny Iki can say, for instance, that the man's life is over and he can't do anything. Because of his power, Chorny Iki is also "invited" to the sacrifice, but according to KK, because of his capacity for harm his image is set apart from the main area of the sacrifice. Feast and Thanksgiving Food Preparation and Feast After the prayer and sacrifice, the women immediately returned to their conversations and the men began to bring them the intestines and the stomachs of the butchered ani- mals. The large stomachs were cleaned and returned to the men to be filled with blood; the small stom- achs were stuffed with cleaned intestines. Some of the stomachs, along with hearts and livers, were put</page><page sequence="10">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 91 in pots of boiling water to cook. Then feasting be- gan, with bread and hot tea for everyone. An elder brought some of the muscle meat to be eaten raw with salt. Both men and women also consumed some of the cooked stomach, heart, and liver. While the feasting was going on, and indeed throughout the day, men and women mixed only around the central cooking fire. Altar Offering While feasting was going on, some of the cooked hearts and livers were placed on the altar, and the rest distributed to the men to be eaten. At this time money was also collected from the men and put on the altar next to the fabrics and canned goods. Thanksgiving The feasting ended with another call to prayer. Men and women separated and returned to their designated areas. They formed ranks and re- peated the actions of the first prayer, described above, this time offering prayers of thanksgiving. Distribution of Gifts Distribution of Fire After the thanksgiving prayer, the entire group reassembled around the fire, men and women being careful to stand on opposite sides of the fire, nearest their designated areas. The chirta- ko stepped forward with a red cloth which he touched to the foreheads of each man and woman. Then he went up from the fire area to the nartés to touch the cloth to the foreheads of the mothers and children who remained there. The elder returned to the groups assembled around the central fire, held up the cloth, prayed to Tyurs Nay Arjki, and threw the red cloth into the fire. From that point, the fire was not fed again with wood. Distribution of Meat The women remained near the fire, while the men, including the outsiders, gath- ered to sit in a large circle between the altar area and the cooking fire. The elder directed two young boys to distribute the butchered meat among the men. Each man received about three kilograms of meat. Occasionally the boys consulted the elder about who should get a particular cut of meat. KK said that the meat is distributed in this way "so that no one would go away offended." Closing Prayer and Departure of the Women After the distribution of meat, the men and women formed ranks again and repeated the previous prayer actions, closing the formal part of the sacri- fice open to both sexes. The women immediately began loading cooking gear and supplies, before re- turning with the children to the encampment on nartés, accompanied by a few men. Disposition of Materials and Departure Disposition of Altar and Skins The men put the altar boards and the birch tree into the forest. Only an altar cloth offering was left on site. The skins of the sacrificed deer, along with the cloth offerings that had been tied around their necks, were taken into the forest on a nearby bank. Care was exercised in selecting two tall, slender birch trees about 15-20 m in height. A boy shinnied up each tree, bringing with him a rope that he tossed over a high limb and let down to the ground. The end was tied to a bun- dle of deer skins and cloths. In this way the bundles were hauled into the treetops. With each pull, the men cried "Wo-wo-wo!" KK remarked that these are vocables with no semantic content: "They repeat 'Wo-wo-wo' to attract the attention of /urjs; some- times they shout three times, sometimes seven times. When in unfamiliar places on big rivers, peo- ple throw coins and say 'Wo-wo-wo/ " BN con- firmed as much, telling us: "These are untranslatable sounds. They send the souls [of the reindeer] up and attract the gods' attention to them." When the offerings had been pulled to the high limb, they were tied there by the boys, who then shinnied back down. After the offerings were tied up, all the men marched clockwise in single file around the base of the sacrificial tree four times. Several other trees in this area also had offerings from earlier sacrifices tied to them. The final dispo- sition of the mandibles and thighs was not ob- served, but presumably they were also cached in the trees, perhaps as part of these bundles, perhaps sep- arately. Our Pirn River Khanty informant, KK, ob- served, that "The skins are hung on the trees and the iui}s take the reindeer specifically determined for them. PK confirmed this: "The reindeer's skin is hung on the tree to make his kaine [a kind of soul] go up, and the god would take it to himself. The people pray that the god would take the spirit of the reindeer in a good way." Disposition at Pine Tree Along the trail leading into the forest to the place of the sacrificial trees, a special area was identified just off the trail. At the base of a pine tree, a bucket had been turned upside down in the snow and two pieces of cloth, perhaps scarves, were opened flat and placed there, one on each side of the bucket. KK, who lives near the sac- rifice site, understood this as a different find of of- fering: "The bucket and the scarf. The bucket is for the earth, Muix Imi. She's a woman, and the scarf is also for her. They pray to her. They also cut a deer for her." PK also knew that "With a big yir they put a pot or bucket covered with a black scarf, or even dig it into the mud but not deep, and leave it there. This was for women, a women's offering." The Black Man Finally, the men removed the metal image of the Black Man which had been made specifically for this sacrifice to the other bank of the river, where it was placed next to the older</page><page sequence="11">92 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 one. The site being cleared, the men returned to the chum encampment. Evening Gathering According to KK, "After the sac- rifice, the participants gather together again with the chirta-ko who led the fly agaric shamanizing. They ask whether the sacrifice has been a success and whether the gods have accepted the reindeer." Event Structure and Signification If today one inquires, even of knowledgeable Khanty, what is to be accomplished by offering these sacrifices, one will receive only the most gen- eralized response: happiness and prosperity, health, a longer and easier life. Additionally, only the most generalized reciprocal mechanism is articulated; as KK expressed it: the spirits do this "because they know that the man will make yir for them." If, however, such statements lead us to think that prosperity is measured in terms of meat, fish, and furs, we are immediately faced with interpre- tive difficulties. First, Khanty domesticate reindeer but reindeer do not provide them with their princi- pal source of food. The small size of most extended family reindeer herds (about 40 animals) permits Khanty in Surgut region to kill usually only two or three animals per winter; this is sufficient to pro- vide only a small amount of meat for an average ex- tended family of twelve persons. Prosperity, if measured in food mass, comes principally from fishing, even in winter (Wiget 1999a). So how does even the sacrificial offering of a supplementary food supply bring about prosperity? A second complica- tion arises from the fact that while the majority of Khanty food is obtained from hunting and fishing, the animal sacrificed is domesticated. Khanty ac- knowledge that the ritual enacts a reciprocity be- tween the human world and the world of the spirits. Does this mean that, just as the typical altar offerings of fabrics, canned food, and bread can be understood as representing a return to the spirits of human transformations of the natural elements of the plant world, the sacrifice of reindeer can be un- derstood to represent a return to the spirits of the gift of wild reindeer which Khanty transformed through domestication? These conundrums require us to consider just how the communal sacrifice en- acts belief in order to "accomplish" the prosperity claimed for it by those who sustain this tradition through their participation. It appears that myr achieves its function by making visible the roles of the several deities in the complex eschatology associated with the regenera- tion of living things. For this purpose, three themes are particularly highlighted by the ritual: the partici- pation of pairs of gendered deities, their distinct but complementary association with the sky world and the underworld, and their collaboration in fusing flesh/form and animating spirit to regenerate life on the earth-surface world. These forces are first ar- rayed within the space of the sacrifice site, which is laid out on two axes (Fig. 2). The first, downriver axis links one set of core dyadic elements in Khanty mythology, males and the Sky (addressed as the Sun), with females/children and the Earth (at the place of the New Fire). The second, cross-river axis links the earth-surface world of the sacrifice area with the underworld marked by the two metal fig- ures of Kul or Kyn Lurj, the spirit of disease. It thus appears that the basic schema of Khanty three-zone cosmology is realized in the preparation of the sacri- fice site. Within this space are two principal activity areas: the birch tree/altar/black man sculpture and the new fire/cooking area. Within this space, two deities, Tyurs Nay Anki and Kul, are made present through physical representations, and two, Torum and Kon Iki, are invoked through prayer. The ritual sequence of events which are enacted in this space dramatize relationships between the various signifi- cations of these four deities and their collaborative role in the regeneration of living beings. The two axes organizing the sacrifice site inter- sect at the birch tree/altar. Birches, like the sapling set on the first axis running along the river between the tree-altar and the fire, are sacred trees with many associations in Khanty mythology. According to Karjalainen, Vas- Yugan River Khanty imagine a birch forest in the sky, so all gifts to the sun, wind, and celestial deities were bound to a birch tree (Ku- lemzin 1984:166). While the creation of man is vari- ously accounted for, at least one version has man created from birch branches (Kulemzin 1984:164). Setting up this sapling may represent the first birch tree which sprang up where Tyurs Nay Anki, preg- nant with the principal culture hero, was cast down from the sky. From her were born Numing Iki (Sky Man) and Muix Anki (Earth-Surface Woman). In 1994, BM, a Trom-Agan River Khant who was not present at the myr that we attended but who had at- tended others, described Tyurs Nay Anki as "a whirlpool in the middle of the ocean, swirling around a permanent fire at the bottom of it." Ac- cording to KK, Tyurs Nay Arjki played a key role in human history: The first world was inhabited by /izrjs, not people like us. A great fire was sent around the world, de- stroying it. [He added, in response to our question: The fire was sent to renew the people.'] Those who ran away perished; some of those who stayed sur- vived. The fire was put out by a flood, perhaps also sent by this woman, because the fire became the flood. Some children were put on rafts, and they floated away to different parts of the world, and that's how the world was populated.6 Every fire is Tyurs Nay Anki's daughter (Kulemzin 1976:45). These fires are living beings, and can be</page><page sequence="12">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 93 wounded or insulted (Kulemzin and Lukina 1973: 36; Kulemzin and Lukina 1990:180). Kulemzin and Lukina observed that in the past on the Bolshoi Yu- gan River, white reindeer were sacrificed to Tyurs Nay Arjki, the mother of all fires, whose name they write as Churas Nay Arjki (Kulemzin and Lukina 1992:93). Although today, reindeer are no longer present or sacrificed on the Yugan, PK told us, "When they make offerings to Tyurs Nay Arjki, they make fire without matches. Tyurs Nay Arjki is more important than Muix Arjki [Earth Old Woman]. In previous times they thought that Muix Arjki is Tyurs Nay's daughter." Tyurs Nay Arjki is the first being, the mother of all change; her association with water and fire, two elements whose formlessness has suggested mu- tability from the most ancient times, derives from this belief. In the Khanty world view all things are divided into those that are alive and those that are not. Things that are alive - humans, animals, trees, fire, thunder, lightning, and spirits - receive lit, an animating soul, from Arjki Puyos, when they are born. If a child is stillborn, it is because it lacks lit (Kulemzin 1976:41-42). Arjki Puyos, we were told by PK, is one of Tyurs Nay Arjki's daughters, along with Muix Arjki (Earth Old Woman). On another oc- casion PK told us that Muix Arjki is one of three daughters, each associated with one of the three ver- tical zones of the cosmos.7 This would associate Arjki Puyos with the skyworld, Muix Arjki with the earthsurface world, and another sister with the un- derworld, so that through her daughters, as aspects of herself, Tyurs Nay Arjki is active and present in all worlds. Semiotically, it appears that what links earth, fire, and water in the Khanty world- view is the identification of the female procreation with mutable forms. Near the birch representing Tyurs Nay Arjki is the metal image of The Black Man, a literal transla- tion of the Khanty phrase, Puixt Iki, which is an ep- ithet for Kyrj Lurj, the spirit of disease (Kulemzin 1976:12 ff). Both are name forms of the name, Kul, whom Vakh River and Vas- Yugan River Khanty be- lieve to be the eldest son of Torum, sent to the earth in order to people it. When people multiplied too much, he left and went into the underworld and be- gan to reduce their numbers by spreading disease through the agency of spirits under his control and by eating people's hearts (Kulemzin 1976:31). Kul's role as progenitor is ambiguous because the nature of his rivalry with Torum is understood differently by different groups.8 One variant of the story of the origin of people attributes their creation, not just their multiplication, to Kul - Kyrj Lurj, albeit at the behest of Torum (Kulemzin 1976:45). Often the ori- gin of animals is attributed to Torum and the cre- ation of ugly or unpleasant things to Kul (Kulemzin 1984:163) Kul is the Khanty collective noun for fish, and he is known as Kul Tete Ko or Kul Tete Lurj (Fish Creator Man/Spirit). As a result, he is symbolized by the great fish: in one myth, he is identified with the sturgeon; common practice also associates him with the pike, especially old pike "with horns," though the pike may be simply one of his many agents. He is also considered the general patron of lakes and rivers. Linguists have demonstrated the distribution among many Finno-Ugrian languages of forms of the proto-Finno-Ugric *kolja, variously sig- nifying "evil spirit, monster, pestilence, water demon," (Ajkhenvald et. al. 1989:155). Kul's underworld home figures in reflections on his role in creation. Khanty believe that animals are released onto the earth's surface from under- ground (Kul's domain), and Torum, the sky god, has been described by some Khanty, as the distributor (i.e., not specifically creator) of game. By virtue of his underworld home, Kul is also associated with metal, especially iron, and with the color black [puixt, in Khanty). He is also called Kellox Torum, god of the dead. He is thus appropriately repre- sented at the sacrifice by the metal figures made to personify him. Two other principal deities are involved in the sacrifice, Torum and Kon Iki. These deities are among the principal deities of the Khanty. Ac- cording to some Ob'-Ugrian myths, Torum is the son of Tyurs Nay Arjki, the woman thrown from the sky; in other versions, he is the husband who cast her down. In either case, Kon Iki is Tyurs Nay Arjki's son, who lives in the ethereal realm between the earth-surface world of his mother and the sky world of Torum. In connection with the solar cult, he is the seventh and youngest son of Torum and known as Mir-susne-xum or World- Watching-Over- Man, because he travels across the sky as the sun, befriending and protecting people. Regional tradi- tions vary concerning Torum's role in relation to game. In some cases Torum created everything, in- cluding all the animals, and then absented himself from this world (Kulemzin 1976:32-33, 45), delegat- ing stewardship responsibility to Kon Iki. In others he left creation of living things to his eldest son, Kyrj Lurj, who, having released the procreative power on earth, had to stop the excess reproduction by introducing disease (Kulemzin 1976:31). At a myr, Torum and Kon Iki are made present through invocations, which are addressed to the sun. Karjalainen appeared to minimize the signifi- cance of the praying: "To some extent they use prayer, but it is only a part of the procedure accom- panying sacrifice and connected with it. It contains only the listing of needs and desires" (Karjalainen 1995, 2:96). However our Khanty informant, KK, ex- plained that such prayer is more than accompani- ment, in the process sustaining Kulemzin's assertion (1984:114) that all Khanty apply to Torum through Kon Iki:</page><page sequence="13">94 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 When [each time] mukhta-ku speaks, he speaks the same words, but the /urjs are different. They put the reindeer according to the order, from the biggest farj to the smallest one. If there are a lot of reindeer, there will be two or three reindeer for each /un. They always pray to the sun and moon together. Kon Iki's father [Torum] is the main one. He never communicates with people himself; he is simply very busy with writing. Kon Iki protects the earth sphere [shar zemnoi, in Russian). In the prayer they ask for a good life, happiness. KK also suggested that there was a dimension of personal as well as communal petition in this prayer: "When you stay on your knees, you ask for something. You turn yourself around three or seven times." While this ambiguity partly helps us to under- stand why both Torum and Kyrj Lug should be in- volved in this sacrifice, a brief discussion of Khanty eschatology is also required to understand how the ritual assures prosperity by enacting the regenera- tion of reindeer. The entire Khanty cosmos, as men- tioned earlier, is divided into that which is alive and that which is not. Every being has multiple souls: men have five, women four, animals two. While the multiplicity of souls has always inter- ested ethnographers among the Ob'-Ugrians, what is most important for this discussion is that the two souls that the animals possess, HI and Us, are also two of the multiple souls which men and women possess, and seem to be the core elements of Khanty soul concept (Wiget and Balalaeva 1995). Briefly, HI is the breath-soul, associated with individual's per- sonality and animating principle; it can be reincar- nated. Us is the shadow soul, associated with visible form and appearance; it is independent of the indi- vidual HI and stays with the body. Chernetsov provided the key to understanding the dynamics of this concept, when he observed that after death, the lit returns to Torum to be re- newed, while the Us goes to Kul in the underworld to be reincarnated (in Kulemzin 1984:21). Karja- lainen noted that, "Just the its of the sacrificed ani- mal is proposed to the spirit. 'We killed reindeer for you. Take its Us and look at it with your eyes huge like forest lakes/ This is the prayer during the sacri- fices" (Karjalainen 1995, 1:39). From information gathered concerning Khanty eschatology, one can reconstruct a Khanty belief that creation takes the form infusing these two souls, life soul and form soul, into primal matter supplied by the Earth Mother. Khanty believe that it is Arjki Puyos who infuses the animating soul, HI, received from Torum into living beings at their birth (Kulemzin 1976:39). In the same manner it would appear that Muix Anki (or perhaps the third daughter of Tyurs Nay Arjki) unites primal matter with the Us or form soul re- ceived from Kul, to whom it had returned, in order to provide a body for the new being. Every living thing thus comes into being in the earth-surface world and is given shape, individuation, and anima- tion through two parallel, simultaneous processes. Each process involves a collaborative co-creation be- tween a pair of male and female deities, one in the skyworld (Torum/ Arjki Puyos), one in the under- world (Kul/Muix Anki) (Wiget and Balalaeva 1995). Understanding the collaborative roles of Torum/ Arjki Puyos on the one hand and Kul/Muix Arjki on the other in the regeneration of animals helps us understand the feeding of the birch tree and the Black Man. The antiquity of this tradition is attested by Karjalainen who quotes Guagnino's 1578 observation that during reindeer sacrifice, "Obdorski Ugrians and Voguls kill 'chosen reindeer with which blood they wipe the mouth, eyes and other parts of the idol's body'" (Karjalainen 1995, 2:98). He himself observes that "the shaman making sacri- fice to Vaja-artt-ko, 'Man-distributing-game,' says, 'Great Torum, eat; Mother of the Earth, eat; and so on . . .'" (Karjalainen 1995, 2:206). Taken together with other cultic elements, such as the disposition of skins in the top of a birch tree at the end of the ritual, the attaching of bits of meat to the birch tree and the image of the Black Man appear to dramatize a communication to Torum and Kul to send meat to the people in the form of reindeer. After the feasting, the male-female collabora- tion in regeneration is signaled again. The chirta-ko invoked Tyurs Nay Arjki and touched red cloth to the foreheads of all assembled around the fire kin- dled by the new fire, including the outsiders, assur- ing that every home will have fire for the next year. KK observed that "the fire is the first visible /izrj; we even kiss the red fabric in order to make her know that everybody was there." Then the group segre- gated according to sex, and the men present re- ceived the distribution of meat from the sacrificed animals. Finally, the male-female collaboration is un- derscored in the disposition of sacrificial materials. The Khanty practice of hanging skins and placing bones in trees follows the mythological theme of re- turning the spirit of the animal to the Keeper of Game or Master of Animals to be reclothed with new flesh and sent back to the earth-surface world for the benefit of the people (Kulemzin 1984:162- 63). This conception is also implied in distinction Karjalainen made concerning the "soul covering": For this purpose they hang the head together with the hooves because they probably think that the soul, separate from the body in the beginning, exists in them. In this view is found the basis of the cus- tom in Surgut region to take from the living sacri- fice animal its soul covering, that is, its soul, and to offer only it [not the body] to the spirit, while ani- mal remains to serve the one who makes this sacri- fice in the flesh. (Karjalainen 1995, 2:102)</page><page sequence="14">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 95 Our Pimskii Khanty informant, KK, observed, that "The skins are hung on the trees and the tur^s take the reindeer specifically determined for them." PK confirmed this: "Reindeer skins are hung on the tree to make his kaine [a kind of soul] go up, and the god would take it to himself. The people pray that file god would take the spirit of the reindeer in a good way." The disposition of the bucket and scarf at the base of the pine tree was understood as a different kind of offering by KK, who lives near the sacrifice site: "The bucket and the scarf. The bucket is for the earth, Muix Imi [Muix Arjki]. She's a woman, and the scarf is also for her. They pray to her. They also cut a deer for her." PK also knew that "With a big yir they put a pot or bucket covered with a black scarf, or even dig it into the mud but not deep, and leave it there. This was for women, a women's offer- ing." If the birch at the top of which the reindeer skins were hung is associated with Tyurs Nay Agki, the pine tree is associated with Taren, the wounding spirit, who can enter a man and make him lose control, so that he becomes violent, fights all the time, and wounds people. This spirit also causes suicides and accidents, and is associated with disease and war (Kulemzin 1984:54). PK said that "Taren is the biggest, oldest god," though he was surprised to find that north of the Ob* they con- sidered Taren to be female not male. The relation- ship between Taren (male or female) and Muix Agki remains unclear, though the implements and how they were arrayed suggests a disposition here on the earth of the female/cooking elements in the sacri- fice, as much as the hanging of the deer skins in the tops of the trees suggests the disposition of the male/hunting elements. It seems clear that myr assures prosperity to its adherents by reinforcing a community ethos in which killing and consuming meat is sanctioned within a reciprocal relationship between the deities who regenerate animals and the humans who kill and consume them. In such a closed system, care for the Us of the slain animal assures that it will re- turn again to yield up its flesh. Such beliefs are fa- miliar from other northern indigenous hunting cultures. Complicating the matter is the fact that the animal sacrificed is domesticated. However, it is likely that the eastern Khanty, like others participat- ing in adaptive processes, were able to find in their own inventory of hunting and fishing practices and beliefs, especially rituals associated with hunting animals, especially moose (woya, in Khanty) (Ku- lemzin 1984:86-7), some which could be readily transformed so as to accommodate the adoption of reindeer husbandry and domestic reindeer sacrifice. These may have included the ritual disposition of skulls, antlers, and bones; the reservation of blood, certain organs and parts of meat, and the ritualized distribution of meat; as well as gender-based pro- scriptions on participation. The historical explana- tion is supported by Karjalainen's observations at the beginning of this century that Khanty of Surgut region were sacrificing domestic animals - horses, cows, and reindeer - to Woya-Ort-Dd, the Distributor of Game (Karjalainen 1995, 2:206,223). Cultural Specialists and Adaptive Trends One of the noteworthy elements of the event we witnessed was the way in which the roles of cul- tural specialists differed from the way in which they have been depicted in the ethnographic literature. When speaking in Russian to outsiders, Khanty cus- tomarily refer to any or all of those acting in these roles as "shamans" and to the actions associated with them as "shamanizing," though most of these roles do not reflect the common characteristics asso- ciated with Siberian shamanism. Based on field data now forty years old, Ku- lemzin (1976) described cultural specialist roles among the eastern Khanty in such a categorical manner that the author appears to have undervalued signs of consolidation. For example, the function of one such specialist, the arekhta-ko, or singer spe- cialist, parallels that of the monteh-ko and overlaps in many ways with that of the chirta-ko. The princi- pal difference is that the arekhta-ku never used a drum {buben, in Khanty) but shamanized with a stringed instrument {narkas-yukh or panan-yukh). Indeed, in some communities where both stringed instrument and drum were known, the stringed in- strument was preferred. The geographical distribu- tion of buben/narkas-yukh is suggestive. On the south side of the middle Ob', stringed instruments were used for shamanizing {narkas-yukh and pa- nan-yukh); on Yugan and Salim-Balik river systems, drums were not known at all. At the same time, the stringed instrument was not known north of the highlands separating the middle Ob' taiga Khanty from the forest/tundra Nenets. However, on the north side of Ob' and among Vas- Yugan Khanty both were used, and shaman apprentices who started on panan-yukh, put it aside for the drum when they became chirta-ko. Clearly this situation provides room for the redefinition of cultural spe- cialist roles according to criteria different from Kulemzin's. By valuing difference rather than commonal- ity, Kulemzin reduces the possibility for appreciat- ing the kinds of changes in cultural specialist roles that we witnessed at the myr. Kulemzin (1976) identified seven distinct cultural specialist roles among eastern Khanty. Two of these are of impor- tance in the production of myr we attended: the multeh-ko (monteh-ko) and the chirta-ko.</page><page sequence="15">96 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 Kulemzin describes the multeh-ko's role as pri- marily that of a storytelling specialist (and indeed we know people, such as PK, who are such and who acknowledge this title). Kulemzin adds that the multeh-ko is also known as the one who can speak to the gods, and therefore can function as a combi- nation of priest and master of ceremonies, i.e., not only leading prayers, but also organizing and direct- ing the production of ritual. Finally, he notes that in some places the multeh-ko has been credited with both divination and healing, though these are both secondary roles. In the ritual we attended, the mul- teh-ko (Pirn River dialect, mukhteh-ko) served as the ritual manager, and the figure whose activity is most prominent during the daylong ritual of reindeer sac- rifice. According to KK, the mukhteh-ku is the per- son "who knows the words, how to do it; some of them speak as (fluently as if) they are telling a tale, and some can't even articulate the words." In the event we attended, both AM and his eldest son functioned in the role of multeh-ko. Among Trom- Agan River Khanty, the role of multeh-ko is a per- manent one, which may be filled by more than one person, and it was clear that AM was grooming his son to succeed him in this. But this position does not seem to require any of the other characteristics mentioned by Kulemzin, such as a broad storytell- ing repertoire or abilities for divination and healing. The chirta-ko is the second important special- ist role. As described in the literature, the chirta-ko is the eastern Khanty specialist role, which most closely matches several characteristics of Siberian shamans, including receiving his vocation as a gift from the gods, dependence on the drum and dis- tinctive drumming techniques, entering trances, and having a special costume. Our Pirn River Khanty informant, KK, said that typically, the chirta-ko has his own distinctive song which he ac- companies by drumming; however he may also sim- ply drum, and, after drumming, narrate the vision or communication that came to him while drum- ming. According to KK, a chirta-ko "knows the words that can reach god, but only when he beats the drum does the drum take the words to the god." Distinguishing between consensual knowledge and his own speculation, KK continued by person- ally expanding on the common Khanty idiomatic phrase that the chirta-ko has "a road to the god," suggesting that in song the chirta-ko actually goes to the lui} or the /ur) comes to him along this road. The chirta-ko role was not visible at all during the daylong sacrificial ritual. It emerged only during the fly agaric shamanizing and divination we heard as part of the preparatory rites for the sacrifice and in the evening shamanizing following the sacri- fice. Several things about the behavior of the chirta- ko in the event we witnessed differ from earlier eth- nographic descriptions. Foremost is its heavy de- pendence on fly agaric shamanizing as a vehicle for divination. Kulemzin notes a cultural specialist role named the pankal-ko (fly agaric man); after he had drunk water saturated with fly agaric mushroom, people came to him while he slept and listened to the dreams he narrated while in a trance state (Ku- lemzin 1976:60). Fly agaric divination was also used by the pankal-ko to locate the sources of illness in a sick person's body so that they can be removed or to identify through dreams the source of disease or illness. Although fly agaric is widely known and used throughout the middle Ob' as a vehicle for div- ination, the term, pankal-ko, was never used by our informants. It may be simply that behaviors that were once exclusively associated with a specialist role have simply become widespread. It may also be true that the two roles, pankal-ko and chirta-ko, are now in the process of fusing, for certainly what was happening on the night prior to the sacrifice was divination. If the latter is true, it may be a continuation of a long process of consolidation of cultural specialist roles among the eastern Khanty. Some roles, such as the elaborated arekhta-ku, may have complex histo- ries. Certainly ongoing physical contact with the Nenets and the historical influence of Nenets drum shamanism was a constant source of acculturative pressure on stringed-instrument traditions. However, such erosion may have been accelerated in this cen- tury by other factors. Certainly significant was the loss of the cohort of elders, who were raised in the pre-Soviet period and socialized and educated in the bush. These have been replaced by the present (but indeed quickly passing) generation born in the 1920s and 1930s, who were subjected to a wide va- riety of acculturative pressures including collectiv- ization, boarding school education, and military service. Second, one cannot discount the impact of dislocation by development of the Ob' floodplain Khanty residence group (As Yakh) reported to us. Of all the eastern Khanty groups, our informants tell us, the Ob' Khanty had best sustained the epic and mythic song traditions, and among them the arekhta- ko would have been the most numerous. To this we might add our own observation of the widespread decline in competence among the younger genera- tion of elders, born in the 1950s and 1960s, in man- aging the oral-literary and epic-song registers of the Khanty language, which clearly could account for diminishing numbers of both arekhta-ko and mul- teh-ko specialists. Other roles, such as the pankal- ko, perhaps may have simply ceased to be special- izations, as the behaviors associated with them became popularized. Such popularization itself might be accounted for in many ways, including the absence of any need to master complex registers of the Khanty language or complex musical instru- ments.</page><page sequence="16">Wiget and Balalaeva: Khanty Communal Reindeer Sacrifice 97 Conclusion The processes claimed to have been responsible for undermining Khanty traditional beliefs and prac- tices are numerous. Some, such as the Russian at- tacks on Khanty shrines in the eighteenth century or the Soviet atheism campaigns that persecuted the shamans in this century, took this as their specific and singular purpose. For others, such as the reset- tlement strategies and the environmental destruction associated with petroleum development, indirect impacts are supposed. Some truth appears in all of these accounts, but the event documented here sug- gests that reports of the death of Khanty traditional religious practice are certainly premature. Cultural persistence has been attributed to a wide variety of factors (Rushforth and Chisholm 1991). While it is beyond the scope of this paper to articulate all the mechanisms that may be at work in accounting for the persistence of communal rein- deer sacrifice among the eastern Khanty living in the northern part of Surgut region, several deserve mention. First, they remain in contact and occasion- ally intermarry with the Nenets, from whom Khanty adopted reindeer husbandry centuries ago and who serve as a source of renewal for all traditions associ- ated with reindeer breeding. Second, despite having adopted reindeer husbandry from the Nenets, the reindeer have become for these Khanty a symbol of their own cultural distinctiveness in the face of the dominant Russian society. A heightened investment in reindeer and reindeer sacrifice might have devel- oped among the eastern Khanty in the 1930s follow- ing the so-called Kazym Rebellion (Golovnev 1995), when Soviet attempts to enforce collectivization and redistribute reindeer prompted a violent response by the Kazym River Khanty. Such negative reinforce- ment of oppositional identity from the past is com- pounded today by positive stereotyping on the part of local government officials who welcome yir at of- ficial occasions and direct distinguished visitors in- terested in Khanty to those settlements where they have large, attractive herds of reindeer. In the atmo- sphere of oil development, reindeer have become the contested icon in local arguments over develop- ment, with Khanty regularly talking about poisoned reindeer and government officials pointing to the vi- ability of both "traditional Khanty and their rein- deer." Third, the event we witnessed brought together a group of related families centered around AM, the sponsor and chirta-ko at this event. AM is also the son of a Kazym reindeer breeder who par- ticipated in the rebellion and subsequently fled to upper Trom-Agan River. KK's testimony also points to local groups of related families as the social vehi- cle for sustaining this practice. Although communal reindeer sacrificing has survived, it also appears to have changed. Implicit in KK's discussion of spirit motivation of the three myr[s] in which he participated is the idea that pro- ducing myr is now motivated by a variety of rea- sons. Though the temporal setting of myr may still be late fall or early spring, its direct association with hunting and fishing prosperity seems less clear, more encumbered by other motives, often difficult to articulate. Contemporary reports, including this one, also suggest an increased emphasis on fly aga- ric divination, which is apparent in the activity framing the actual day of sacrifice and in the fusing of the roles of chirta-ko and pankal-ko. Finally, we have neither heard nor read of any myr comparable in scale to the event we witnessed. Both in numbers (more than sixty participants and eleven reindeer sacrificed) and complexity, this was an extraordi- nary occasion. One might hypothesize that, under the conditions of social and environmental stress that petroleum development has brought to the east- ern Khanty, myr seems fated to bear an ever-greater burden of cultural functions realized through in- creasing cultic complexity. One may also argue, however, that myr will persist because it dramatizes the core relationships of the Khanty world and con- tinues to solicit from ritual participants a recom- mitment to those beliefs and the practices they entail.

Respecting the privacy of those Khanty individu- als who provided information the authors have cho- sen to identify them only by their initials. We</page><page sequence="17">98 Arctic Anthropology 38:1 visited KK on his stoibishe (extended family settle- ment) on the Ai-Pim River in June 1995 and June 1996, interviewing him extensively on both occa- sions. The authors began joint fieldwork with PK on the Yugan in March 1992 and have returned to his stoibishe every summer since 1994. Other Khanty quoted herein include JS and BN, both Trom-Agan River Khanty, whom the authors visited in the sum- mer of 1994. 3. The literature on the circumpolar bear cult, be- ginning with the classic Hallowell 1926, is well- known. Important discussions of these practices among the Khanty can be found in Gondatti 1886, Kulemzin 1972, and Schmidt 1989. 4. A. P. Zen'ko (1997) declared that collective sacri- fices have a higher status than individual sacrifices, but the text is unclear as to whether this is his claim or a Khanty claim, nor does he provide any evidence for this claim. We have found nothing in our fieldwork data nor in the literature that would support such a claim. 5. Karjalainen objected to B. Munkasci's assertion that horse sacrifice was aboriginal, arguing instead that it was a result of Tatar influence (Karjalainen 1995, 2:100). 6. This idea is also subject to millenialist and Chris- tian apocalyptic interpretations. Our notes record PK's reflections: "He didn't know whether it was Tyurs Nay Anki or her daughter who caused flood. Khanty used to tell that flood-fires happen every 2,000 years, and the last one was nearly 2000 years ago (he measures from the end of this century). Also, he heard that people make sins and god burns their sins and then washes them with the flood. Probably on the year 2000, he thinks, there will be no flood, perhaps something else. 7. The lack of clarity as to whether Tyurs Nay Anki has three daughters or whether she is one of three sisters is not uncommon when relationships among deities governed by a genealogical model are con- fused by regional differences, loss of mastery of tra- dition, or other factors. Similar confusion also appears in the relationship between Kul and Torum and between Kul and Kon Iki. 8. In another myth, he is known as Torum's elder brother, both born from the earth mother, Anki Puxos. His antagonism to the sky power is differ- ently represented according to the whichever genea- logical model is locally sustained by mythology. If Kul is considered to be Torum's son, his rival is an- other son of Torum, Kon Iki. If Kul is viewed as Torum's brother, his rival is Torum himself. References Ajkhenvald, A., E.
