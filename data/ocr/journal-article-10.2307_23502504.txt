<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE By JULIAN MORGENSTERN, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, O. I XODUS 34, 29-35 PRESENTS an interesting problem both -*-י־ in analysis and interpretation. These verses contain the story of Moses' face shining after his descent from the mountain following his conversation with Yahwe. In consequence the people could not endure the radiance of Moses' face and fled from before him until he had put a covering over it. Thereafter Moses wore this covering constantly, except at such times when he entered the sanctuary to converse with the Deity. Then he would remove the covering and, impliedly, converse with Yahwe face to face. And upon his return to the people he would restore the covering to his face. Almost all modern Biblical commentators are in agreement in assigning this passage to P.r A number of these scholars assign the closing verses to P2.2 Of all these scholars Carpenter and Harford3 alone assign these verses to a source other than P. 1 So Dillmann, Wellhausen, Kuenen, Cornill (cf. Holzinger, Einlei tungtung in den Hexaleuch, Table), Bacon (The Triple Tradition of the Exodus, 370), Addis (The Documents of the Hexateuch, II, 275), Holzinger (Exodus; in Marti's Hand-Commentar series), Baentsch (Exodus; in Nowack's Hand kommentarkommentar series), and Kent (Beginnings of Hebrew History, 184f.) * Wellhausen regards w. 33-35 as a haggadic addition. Holzinger is uncertain whether to assign vv. 29-32 to Pg and vv.33-35 to P2 or the entire passage to P2. Baentsch assigns vv. 33-35 to P2, while Kent assigns vv. 34-35 to P2. Eerdmans, (Alttestamentliche Studien III, 80f.), too, while of course, in accordance with his opposition to the entire documentary hypothesis, refusing to assign these verses to P, following Wellhausen and Valeton, re gards vv. 34-35 as a late addition. Gressmann (Mose u. seine Zeit, 246f.) admits the possibility of Priestly authorship, at least for a portion of this passage, but at the same time sees certain cogent reasons for questioning this conclusion. נ The Composition of the Hexateuch, 518.</page><page sequence="2">2 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Vv. 29-33 they assign to E and v. 34, and presumably also v. 35,יי toRJE. When we examine these verses carefully we find unmistak able indications of Priestly composition, as for example, v. 29, ושני לחת הערת; v. 31, הנשיאים בעדה; v. 32 the apparent distinction in caste between Aaron and the נשיאים on the one hand, and the people at large on the other; possibly also the designation of the mountain by the name הר סיני, vv. 29 and 32. The priestly character and implication of these expressions are, of course, undeniable. However, when we examine the passage closely, we can not avoid the impression that it does not read with perfect smoothness, quite as if its original text had been worked over by some later editor or glossator. 29a/3 is awkward indeed, and particularly the repetition of משה instead of the use of the pronominal suffix בידו; and again the repetition of ומשה at the beginning of 29b. Likewise vv. 30-32 do not read with perfect smoothness. The position of the subject in 3la/3 is awkward, and the reference to the princes seems almost dragged in. Similarly the words כי קרן עור פני משה in 35a are exceedingly awkward. In contrast to vv. 29-33, vv. 34—35 describe the regular procedure of Moses when consulting the Deity. But, as Addis has pointed out,5 these verses rest upon a foundation that is the very antithesis of Priestly. For they tell that whenever Moses would go into the sanctuary to consult the Deity and ob tain an oracle, he would remove the covering from his face, and when he would come forth from the sanctuary to speak to the people, and, impliedly, to communicate to them what had just been revealed to him, he would restore the covering to his face. Obviously Moses here plays the role of oracular priest, and furthermore has free access to the sanctuary and the Deity at any time he pleases. And inasmuch as according to the Priestly Code not Moses, but Aaron, discharges the duties of 4 Citation of which, singularly enough, they omit, probably through oversight. It should be noted, too, that neither Wellhausen (Die Composition des des Hexaleuchs97) nor Cornill (so in the Table of Holzinger's Einleitung) are positive in their assignment of these verses to P. 5 Op. cit.</page><page sequence="3">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 3 chief or high-priest, and furthermore alone may enter the innermost sanctuary and commune with the Deity only once in each year, on the annual Day of Atonement, it follows absolutely that at least w. 34-35 can not emanate from P. And inasmuch as vv. 34-35 are dependent upon 29-33, and tell that Moses made a regular ritual institution of the practice, the occasion for and inauguration of which are described in w. 29-33, it is impossible to separate vv. 34-35 from vv. 29-33, and ascribe these verses to one source, which is not P, and w. 29-33 to another source, which, if P, is then presumably later than the source of w. 34-35. If vv. 34-35 can not be the work of P, then certainly neither can w. 29-33.6 Yet the presence in these verses of the Priestly elements cited above cannot be gainsaid. This is, however, easily ex plained. Brief consideration shows clearly that the original narrative was reworked by a later Priestly glossator. This original narrative probably read much in this manner: ויהי ברדת משה מן ההר7 ולא ידע כי קרן עור פניו בדברו אתו: וירא אהרן וכל בני ישראל את משה והנה קרן עור פניו וייראו מגשת אליו: ויקרא אליהם משה וישבו אליו: וידבר משה אליהם ויצום את כל אשר דבר יהוה אתו בהר: ויכל משה מדבר אתם ויתן על פניו מסוה: ובבא משה לפני יהוה לדבר אתו יסיר את המסוה עד צאתו ויצא ודבר אל בני ישראל את אשר יצוה: וראו בני ישראל את פני משה כי קרן והשיב משה את המסוה על פניו עד באו לדבר אתו: This may be translated, "Now when Moses descended from the mountain, he did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant because of His (Yahwe's) speaking with him. And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses and behold the skin of his face had become radiant (קרן, perfect, and not par ־ Unless, with Gressmann, we hold that vv. 34-35 are the original and older portion of the narrative, and that vv. 29-33 are a later, aetiological expansion, designed to offer a mythological account of the origin of the custom, the practice of which is recorded in vv. 34-35. This hypothesis, however, is on the one hand too unsubstantiated and almost too absurd to warrant dis cussion, and on the other hand we shall have occasion in the course of this paper to show the untenability of various phases of Gressmann's hypothesis and argument. Therefore we need not discuss this matter further here. ' So also LXX instead of מהר סיני of MT. It may be noted in passing that LXX omits משה in 33; in 34 it inserts כל before טי, and for the passive יצוה it reads the active יצוה יהוה אתו, and finally in 35 it omits עור מני משה.</page><page sequence="4">4 JULIAN MORGENSTERN ticiple), and they feared to approach him. But Moses called to them, and they returned to him. And Moses "spoke" to them, and he commanded them all that which Yahwe had "spo ken"8 to him upon the mountain. And when Moses finished "speaking" with them, he put a veil« upon his face. And when ever Moses would come in (to the tent) before Yahwe to "speak" with Him, he would remove the veil until his going forth. And then he would go forth and "speak" to the children of Israel that which he had been commanded. And when the children of Israel would see the face of Moses that it shone, then Moses would replace the veil upon his face until he went in (again) to "speak" with Him.10 This passage thus tells that as the result of Moses ' speaking with Yahwe his face had acquired a permanent radiance, upon which it was difficult, and in fact well-nigh unbearable, for 8 דבר here used in the technical sense, "to utter a ז־בר; therefore, to com mand, to charge." ~1ךב is a particular kind of law, of absolute character, of which the laws in Ex. 34, 14-26 are typical instances. 9 So LXX and practically all commentators. Gressmann, however, would translate מסוה "mask" (op cit. 249 ff.), and then work out upon the basis of this translation a hypothesis of the wearing of sacred masks by priests in ancient Israel, while consulting the oracle. Practically the only support he can find for his hypothesis is an altogether far-fetched and unsubstantiated trar.slaticn of תרפים as "sacred mask". Moreover, his hypothesis compels a radical change in the content of our present narrative. He would make it tell that Moses wears the mask while consulting the oracle, and removes it when he confers with the people, exactly the opposite to what our story does tell. A hypothesis as fanciful and artificial as this would hardly merit citation, were it not for the indisputable merit of much of Gressmann's work. Here it is unquestionable that Gressmann has far overshot the mark and has shown himself too "geistreich". 10 The following are then the Priestly emendations and interpolations in these verses: 29a. מהר םיני for the original מן ההר. 29a!S. ושני לחות העדות ביד משה ברדתו מן ההר interpolated. 29b. ומשה לא for the original ולא. 31a. אהרן וכל הנשיאים בעדה interpolated. 32a. ואחרי כן נגשו כל בני ישראל interpolated. 32b. בהר סיני for the original בהר. 35 עור פני משה (not necessarily P, but probably only an anonymous and purposeless marginal gloss).</page><page sequence="5">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 5 mortals to gaze. This radiance was comparable to that which, according to Ex. 33, 18ff., emanated from the face of Yahwe Himself, so that no mortal, not even Moses, might gaze upon it and live. At the same time the radiance of Moses' face was not quite so dazzling and unbearable as that of Yahwe's face, for at certain moments at least the children of Israel not only could, but apparently were required to gaze upon it, even though this was difficult for them. For our narrative tells that when Moses descended from the mountain his face shone so brightly, that Aaron and the children of Israel who beheld it feared and fled. But at Moses' bidding they returned to him, and he communicated to them the דברים which had been revealed to him. And only thereafter, when this task was finished completely, did Moses put the veil over his face. Thenceforth he wore this veil constantly, except when he went into the tabernacle to confer with Yahwe and receive further oracular revelations or דברים. Then he would remove the veil and speak to Yahwe face to face. Thereupon he would come forth from the tabernacle and communicate to the people the new דברים that had thus been revealed to him. And the people, beholding once more Moses' shining face, would under stand that he was speaking, not as a private person nor as an ordinary mortal, but as the earthly representative and mouth piece of the Deity, His oracular priest ; and what he was "speaking' ' was the דברים or oracular decisions which had just been com municated to him by Yahwe. And only when the divine reve lation had thus been communicated formally and officially to the people, did Moses restore the veil to his face. Moses with the shining face is thus the official, earthly representative of Yahwe with the shining face, His substitute on earth as it were. And the conclusion is inescapable that about this representative of the Deity, himself with a face shining like that of Yahwe, upon which, too, mortals could look only with difficulty and fear, there hovered something of the divine. Moses has become in this story a kind of a deity, or at least a semi-divine mortal. The effect of the Priestly insertions into this original nar rative was not far-reaching, yet they served to modify slightly, but sufficiently for Priestly purpose, the original character of</page><page sequence="6">6 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the narrative. On the one hand they introduced the regular Priestly division of the people into the separate classes, Moses and Aaron, the princes, and the people at large. In this way it was probably felt that the position of Aaron, which was none too creditable in the original narrative, was redeemed and dig nified somewhat. And on the other hand, the introduction in v. 29 of the reference to the two tablets of testimony, served to give the storya slightly different but quite significant reinterpretation. It was no longer Moses, the oracular priest, who regularly con ferred with Yahwe and brought to the people from time to time new דברים for their edification and guidance, but it was now only that other Moses, who upon just this one occasion alone had been the medium of divine revelation, and had brought down from Sinai the Ten Commandments written upon the two tab lets of testimony. This was the role which Moses is represented as playing in the Priestly portions of Exodus, chapters 19, 24 and 31, and just this is the role which this Priestly glossator, with the skillful interpolation of a few words, now makes Moses play here." Returning now to the original narrative, its secondary character becomes readily apparent upon careful thought. Ob viously it is dependent upon two stories that immediately pre cede it. The first of these is the account of the tabernacle outside of the camp, with Moses as the oracular priest thereof, in Ex. 33, 7-11. The second is the account of the theophany " This leads to an important conclusion. If our narrative in its original form, without the Priestly interpolation in v. 29, told only that when Moses descended from the mountain he communicated to the people orally the דברים which Yahwe had revealed to him upon the mountain, and the reference to the two tablets of testimony is late, then it follows that the narrative im mediately preceding this in Ex. 34, of which this is the ostensible continuation, must also have told only that Yahwe had communicated these דברים to Moses verbally, and could have told nothing of their having been written down by Moses at Yahwe's bidding. This would indicate that vv. 27-28 are themselves secondary, and no part of the original narrative of Ex. 34. And this in turn would obviate a number of problems that have long troubled Biblical com mentators, particularly the problem of how the term עשרת הדברים came to be applied to the little group of laws ;.»'Ex. 34, especially since these are not at all ten in number. But of this elsowhere in the proper place.</page><page sequence="7">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 7 upon the mountain, in Ex. 33, 12-34, 28. Originally these two narratives were entirely independent of each other, and came from altogether different sources. I have discussed briefly these two passages and the question of their authorship in an earlier paper.12 I have shown there, that Ex. 33, 7-11, while usually assigned by scholars to the E code,13 for purely negative and mis taken reasons, was actually an integral part of J, and that the realization of this fact throws valuable light upon certain im portant religious origins and institutions among the southern pastoral tribes of Israel, in the early period of their history. On the other hand, I have stated in this same paper, although without going into detail of evidence and argument, since space forbade this there, my general reasons for holding that Ex. 33, 1 + 12-34, 28, or rather the original nucleus of these verses,14 constituted the oldest piece of prose writing in the Hexateuch. This was in turn a part of an original larger Document which I called there C2. but which I have since, for sufficient reasons, come to designate as the Kenite Document and to label K. This Kenite Document, I stated there, must have been com posed and promulgated in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa of Judah, i. e. 899 B. C., and formed the basis of the far-reaching religious reforms of that king. Then, at a date considerably later this fragment of the or iginal Kenite Document was incorporated into the J Code by a J2 editor.15 To him are due all the amplifications of the » The Tent of Meeting, J AOS 38 (1918), 125-139. 13 Probably chiefly because on the one hand tney realized the close re lationship between Ex. 33, 7-11 and 34, 29-35, and because on the other hand they had assigned, along with most Biblical scholars, 33, 7-11 to E, Carpenter and Harford also assigned 34, 29-35 to E. Undoubtedly had they realized that 33, 7-11 came from J they would have unhesitatingly assigned 34, 29-35 likewise to J. 14 Viz. 33, la, 12a, 14, 18 (reading פניך for כבדך of MT), 20, 19a (reading אעבד for אני אעביר כל טובי and בשמי for בשם יהוה of MT), 22, 23 (reading בעברי for בעבר כבדי of MT); 34, 6aa, 8, 10a, and then the nucleus of the laws in vv. 14-26; and finally Num. 10, 29-32. Probably Ex. 4, 24-26 is also a fragment of this K Document. 15 Indicative of J2 are the references to the land flowing with milk and honey and the promise of Yah we to the patriarchs in 33, lb ; אני in 16 and 19 (revision) ; the use of the theological terms טוב and כבד in 18, 19 and 22 in order to soften</page><page sequence="8">8 JULIAN MORGENSTERN original K nucleus, found in Ex. 33 and 34. Among these we note particularly the frequently repeated motif that Moses has found favor in Yahwe's eyes, and that Yahwe knows him intimately by name. Presuming upon this favor Moses ventures to expostulate with Yahwe, to warn Him of the implications of His intended treatment of Israel, which, apparently, Yahwe had not fully realized, and to point out a better course for Him to pursue. Now our passage in Ex. 34, 29-35, as has been said, is di rectly dependent upon these two originally unrelated and inde pendent narratives. On the one hand, the motifs of Moses descending from the mountain after communing with Yahwe there, and "speaking" to the people the דברים that Yahwe had revealed to him upon the mountain top, are borrowed from the narrative of the ' K document. Likewise the motif that Moses' face shown so dazzlingly that the people feared to look upon it and fled, is undoubtedly dependent upon the motif of the K narrative that no man, not even Moses, could gaze upon Yahwe's countenance and live. It is impossible to tell with certainty what, according to the original concept of the K document, there was about Yahwe's countenance that made it impossible for mortals to gaze upon it. It may have been dazz ling brilliance, but it may equally well have been something altogether different. But it is certain that from the middle of the 8th century B. C. on, due undoubtedly to the growing influence which Assyro Babylonian religion, and particularly certain solar elements thereof, exerted upon the religious beliefs and practices of Israel, the original bald anthropomorphism of the story; 34, 2, the name Sinai for the mountain (in K it is only "the mountain"); 5, the statement that Yahwe descends in the pillar of cloud to the top of the mountain, whereas the original narrative implied that Yahwe dwelt permanently upon the mountain; 6-7, the purely theological, and therefore comparatively late, character of the divine attributes here recorded; 9, ברא ,10 ;עם קשה ערף. Likewise 34, 27-28, the secondary character of which we have just established, must be the work of J2. The reference to the tablets in them of course goes hand in hand with the similar reference in 34, 1-5. Moreover, in 34, 10-26, i. e. in the code of laws, many expressions and even whole clauses and sentences occur that have a decidedly Deuteronomistic flavor.</page><page sequence="9">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 9 Yahwe came to be graphically conceived and represented as a divine, radiant being, emitting dazzling brilliance, just like the great gods of the Assyrian pantheon, and particularly Shamash, the sun-god.16 This brightness or light emanating from Yahwe was technically known as 1.כבד־' Already about 740 B. C. Isaiah sees in his Temple vision the whole earth filled with the כבד or radiance of Yahwe.18 A century and a half later, by which time of course, the concept had become much more developed and graphic, Ezekiel in a vision beholds Yahwe coming from the east to take up His abode once more in the rebuilt Temple, and as He comes along the earth is lit up by his radiance (כבדו). Ezekiel, likewise in a vision, sees Yahwe in human form, but emitting dazzling brightness; he calls this the !כבוד יהוד, i. e. the "brightness" of Yahwe. And the Priestly Code, although it rejects the anthropomorphism of Ezekiel, and pictures Yahwe only as "something like the appearance of fire", enveloped in "the" cloud, still applies the same technical term כבד יהוה to this fiery apparition of Yahwe.19 It is this same technical term כבד which our J2 editor has, in order to reduce the bald an thro pomorphism of the old K narrative, substituted in 33, 18 for the original פניך and again in 22 in the expression בעבר כבדי for the original בעברי. Therefore when Ex. 34, 29-35 tells that Moses' face shone because Yahwe had been speaking with him, it is clear that the author here conceives of Yahwe as a shining, radiant, divine being, precisely in the manner that, as we have just seen, became increasingly general in Israel from the middle of the 8th century B. C. on. He has interpreted the motif of the original K story, that no mortal could look upon Yahwe's face, in the manner current in his day, viz. that because of the radiance emanating from the person, and presumably particularly from the face of 16 As for example upon the well-known and oft-pictured uppermost portion of the famous Hamurappi-stone, where Shamash is represented as giving the laws to the king; note particularly the rays of light coming forth from behind the shoulders of the sun-god. " See my monograph, Biblical Theophanies, ZA 25 (1912), 139-153. 18 Is. 6, 3. '&gt; Ex. 24, 15-18; 40, 34-38; Num. 9, 15-23.</page><page sequence="10">10 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Yahwe, it meant death to gaze upon Yahwe's face.20 It is this same author who softened the gross anthropomorphism of the original K story by speaking of Yahwe's כבד instead of Yahwe's face, and of the passing of Yahwe's כבד before Moses, instead of the passing of Yahwe Himself, and who now tells us here of Yahwe with the shining, dazzling face, and of Moses' face shin ing too in consequence of his having spoken with Yahwe. The motif of the shining face of Yahwe, which he introduced into his revised version of the original K story, he has enlarged upon and extended to Moses too in Ex. 34, 29-35. On the other hand, as said above, the motif of Moses' going in before Yahwe on frequent occasions, in order to consult the oracle and receive new דברים from Yahwe, is dependent upon the J narrative of the Tent of Meeting outside the camp, and of Moses, as the oracular priest, going out there to meet with Yahwe, in Ex. 33, 7-11. There it says explicitly that Yahwe would speak to Moses "face to face just as one man speaks to another." Precisely this is what happens in 34, 34-35. Here, too, Moses removes the covering from off his face, and accordingly he and Yahwe converse face to face. Now it is significant that there is one glaring and unharmon izable contradiction between the J narrative in Ex. 33, 7-11 and the original K narrative that follows immediately after it. The former tells that Yahwe and Moses speak to each other face to face; the latter, on the contrary, tells that no mortal, not even Moses, could gaze upon Yahwe's face and live. For this reason it is, so the K story says, that Yahwe causes Moses to stand in the cave upon the mountain top, and as He passes by, covers the mouth of the cave with His hand ; and only when He has com pletely passed by, does He remove His hand, and thus permit Moses to catch a glimpse of His back, while at the same time His face remains unseen. Apparently the J2 editor, who combined the J and the K narratives, was conscious of this contradiction and tried to soften it, though without much success. For this reason probably he introduced the rather ambiguous and general request of Moses, 20 So Isaiah too reasoned when he said (6, 5), "Woe is me . . . for mine eyes have seen the king, Yahwe Çebaot."</page><page sequence="11">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 11 that Yahwe would cause him to know His way in order that he might know Yahwe truly, and thereby feel certain that he would always find favor in Yahwe's eyes (Ex. 33, 13). To this general request Yahwe unthinkingly assents and says, "Even this thing which thou hast spoken will I do, for thou hast found favor in Mine eyes" (v. 17).21 And then having gained this general as sent to his request, Moses becomes specific and asks to see Yahwe's face. Thus according to the revised J2 version of the story, Yahwe finds Himself cleverly entrapped by Moses. On the one hand He has promised to grant Moses' request; but on the other hand the request is physically impossible, for according to the original K narrative, no mortal, not even Moses, may see Yahwe's face. And so He compromises and concedes to Moses a glimpse of His back and also the knowledge of His true name, which impliedly Moses had not known up to this time; but His face re mains unseen. And with this Moses must needs content him self. At least, in the revised J2 version of the story, Moses has gotten the upper hand over Yahwe, and wrested a valuable con cession from Him.22 None the less the original contradiction is not removed ; rather it is henceforth ignored by the J 2 editor. And just this is what he continues to do in Ex. 34, 29-35. The contradiction is still there in a way. Yahwe with the shin ing face may still not be gazed upon by mortals. Violation of this prohibition means something greatly to be feared and fled from; perhaps death. Even Moses' shining face the people fear to look upon ; and from the consequences of ordinarily gaz ing upon it he must protect them by covering his face constantly, except when he is communicating the oracle to them. But Moses """ That these words can not refer to Moses' implied request in vv. 15-16 that Yahwe Himself go along in Israel's midst, is proved by the fact that in 34, 9 Moses again entreats Yahwe to go along in the midst of the people. This repeated request would be inexplicable had Yahwe already consented in 33, 17 to accompany Israel. It is clear therefore that 33, 17 can refer only to Moses' request to be taught Yahwe's way in v. 13. " Perhaps, too, we may discern here something of the thought that the knowledge of Yahwe's name, thus gained by Moses, gives him henceforth a certain power over the Deity, whereby he can compel the latter to do his bidding. But if anything of this thought had been present in the mind of the J2 editor, he nowhere gives any evidence thereof.</page><page sequence="12">12 JULIAN MORGENSTERN himself enjoys the right which he has wrested from Yahwe, of going in before Him, despite the latter's shining face, with its dire consequences for ordinary mortals, and speaking with Him face to face. Moses has ceased to be an ordinary mortal. His face shines too, almost as brightly and direfully as Yahwe's. Manifestly to the J2 editor Moses has become in a very literal sense semi-divine. But the presence of these two originally completely inde pendent and contradictory motifs, thus closely woven together, indicates beyond all doubt that our story in Ex. 34, 29-35 is based upon and grew out of, not the two original stories as they first existed separately and independently, the one in the K Document and the other in the J Code, but upon the combination of the two as we now find them in Ex. 33 and 34, and as they were woven together, despite the contradiction, by the J editor who incorporated the older K Document, or rather this fragment thereof, into the younger J Code. Clearly, therefore, Ex. 34, 29-35 is, in its original form, before the insertion of the Priest ly elements, the work of J2, and even belongs to a late stratum within J2. II But this picture of Moses as a demi-god, or at least as a semi-divine being, which J2 has created, and which we have thus unfolded, does not stand isolated in Ex. 33 and 34. Other por trayais of this same picture exist elsewhere in the Hexateuch and particularly in the J E accounts of the revelation at Sinai and the attendant and subsequent events. Thus in Ex. 32, 9-14 and again in w. 30-3423 we have the same picture of Moses expostulating with Yahwe, and convincing ג" Ex. 32 is one of the chapters most complex and difficult of analysis in the entire Hexateuch. This becomes doubly clear when one notes the wide diversity in the conclusions of various Biblical scholars with regard to its composition. This much is clear, however, and is admitted by practically all commentators, that vv. 9-14 and 30-34 are interpolations, which very ob viously have little or no connection either with what precedes or what follows in the chapter, but instead seriously interrupt the continuity of the main narrative. The following table, supplementing that of Holzinger, Einleitung</page><page sequence="13">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 13 Him by the force of his arguments that His first impulse to destroy Israel because of its sin was unwise and wrong, and that despite Israel's sin it would be better for Him to forgive it. Above all would not Egypt say that Yahwe was a false god and had de ceived Israel and brought it forth from bondage only to slay it in the wilderness ? For the sake of his reputation, for His name's sake, in other words, Yahwe dare not destroy Israel in the manner He has contemplated. Moreover, let Him remember the patriarchs and His promise to them to give the land of Canaan to their posterity as an everlasting possession. And as for Yahwe Yahwe's word that he would raise up the descendants of Moses to become a great people in place of Israel, let Yahwe dismiss that from His mind; certainly he, Moses, is not attracted by the prospect. Finally, Moses almost threatens, Yahwe must for give Israel; if not, then let Yahwe blot Moses, too, from His book, presumably the book of life; to which Yahwe, on the defensive, replies, that only him who sins will He blot from His book; and as for Israel's punishment, He will defer that for the present. All in all in this argument the victory certainly rests with Moses. We need not hesitate to conclude with most scholars, that both these passages are Yahwistic, and since both are manifestly interpolations, that they are the work of J2. A similar thought is presented in Num. 11, 10-15, 18-23 and 31-34.24 There the people, weary of the manna, hunger for meat, and weep at the doors of their tents. This naturally vexes Yahwe greatly, and, strangely enough, He seems to hold Moses responsible for this. But this Moses resents bitterly, and in no uncertain terms he answers Yahwe with counter in in den Hexateuch, shows the assignment of these verses to the various sources by modern Biblical scholars.

Whence should I get meat to give to all this people, when they wail against me, saying, 'Give us meat and let us eat?' I can not carry all this people alone, for it is too heavy for me. So if Thou wantest to do with me thus, then slay me, if I have found favor in Thine eyes ;but let me not see myself reproached."28 And again, apparently, Moses' argument has convinced Yahwe. At any rate He assumes the responsibility for pro viding the people with the meat for which they have been yearning. But His wrath is not appeased. It is merely turned from Moses to the people, and He promises that this meat, for the sake of which they had rejected Him, shall be to them, not a blessing but a curse, for they shall eat until they sicken of it. To which Moses'sole reply is to express doubt of Yahwe's ability to provide meat in this copious manner for such a multi tude of people.

And in passing we may note the recurrence in these verses of the motif already met with in Ex. 33, of Moses having found favor in Yahwe's sight. The same theme presents itself again, and in most character istic manner, in Num. 14, 11-25.°' There Yahwe is angered because the people put faith in the false reports of the eleven spies, and not in Him and His promise to them, and again an nounces His intention to destroy Israel, and to make of Moses a people greater and mightier in its place. But again Moses rejects the proposition absolutely, and instead urges Yahwe to reconsider His intention, and advances cogent arguments to support his view. When the Egyptians will hear that Yahwe has brought up this people through His power from the midst of Egypt,Egypt, only to let it perish completely in the wilderness, they will say to the other nations round about, who have heard of Yahwe's fame,30 " It was because Yahwe was unable to bring this people to the land which He had sworn to give them, that He has slain them in the wilderness". Now let Yahwe show His true power, and be gracious unto the people, and forgive them, in accordance with His true nature, which He had previously declared unto them. Moved by this unanswerable argument, Yahwe yields, but with a reservation. He will forgive the whole people for its lack of faith in Him, yes; but as surely as His "radiance"31 fills the whole earth, the false spies must be punished ; they shall perish ; but Caleb, who alone had been faithful, shall be rewarded. 'י Here, too, there is almost complete unanimity among modern Biblical scholars, as to the J origin of practically this entire passage, as the subjoined table shows: Bacon Kantzsch Addis Holzinger Carpenter and Harford Baentsch Gray Kent Gress mann vv.vv. 11-25 J RJERJERJE JE JE 11 21 24 25b JEs 12-20 25a gloss J 11-24 EE 25 RJE 11 23 E or RD 24f RP in 14 J2 J2 J J 11a E2 lib- 24 3" LXX reads, more appropriately, שמך for שמעך.

We note also the direct reference in vv. 17f. to the undoubted ly related passage in Ex. 34, 6ff, and the almost exact quotation of vv. 6f. of that chapter, and likewise the reference to Yahwe's "glory" or radiance filling the entire earth, strikingly similar both in thought and expression to Is. 6, 3. Ill There can be not the slightest question that all these pas־ sages, all quite certainly Yahwistic and all obviously secondary, are closely related, are in fact the work of one J2 writer or group of writers. The conception of Yahwe and the picture of Moses and his relation to Yahwe are the same in all the passages. The same motifs repeat themselves again and again, of Moses finding favor in Yahwe's eyes, of Moses venturing to argue with Yahwe, and even to scold Him, and in every case, inducing Him by the force of his arguments to change His mind, and forego His intention of destroying Israel as punishment for their lack of faith in Him ; and particularly the argument that Yahwe must do this for the sake of His name; of Yahwe's intention of raising up a new people, the descendants of Moses, in Israel's stead, and Moses' prompt and absolute rejection of this proposal. The motif of Moses' face shining because of the radiance emanating from Yahwe's face, is paralleled somewhat by the statement in Num. 14, 21 that Yahwe's "glory" or radiance fills the whole earth. These considerations offer a fair indication of the approxi</page><page sequence="17">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 17 mate date of composition of these passages. Very obviously Num. 14, 21 is borrowed directly from Is. 6, 3, and must be later than that passage.32 Likewise the concept that Yahwe might destroy Israel and raise up for Himself a new people in its stead must be later than the first promulgation of this thought by Amos. Furthermore, the motif of Yahwe's anger, roused by Israel's lack of faith in Him, a lack of faith manifested not by desertion to and worship of other gods, but rather by distrust of Yahwe's power and of His ability to cope with the difficult situation that confronts Israel, suggests very strongly the doctrine of faith in Yahwe as it developed in Israel from the days of Isaiah onward. All these considerations point unmis takably to a time later than Isaiah as the period when this little group of J writings must have been composed.33 33 Similarly Ps. 72,19 is dependent either upon Is. 6, 3, or upon both of these passages. 33 Another, though rather vague, indication of the aproximate date of these J2 passages, may perhaps be seen in the reference to Yah we's book from whichMoses asks that his name be blotted out, in Ex. 32, 32f. It is clear that in this book the names of the righteous are regarded as recorded, for in v. 33 Yahwe says explicitly that only the name of him who sins will be blot ted from His book. The inference can hardly be avoided that the recording of the names of the righteous in this book implies that they are to receive some worthy reward, probably length of days; and correspondingly the blotting out of the names of the sinners from the book would probably imply that this privilege of length of days is denied them, that in others words their lives are shortened and their days numbered. There is as yet nothing of the thought of recording these sinners for some positive punishment in the hereafter. This idea here is earlier than the doctrine of future life and reward and punish ment. This book of Yahwe is therefore indeed a book of life and also a book of destiny. The most striking parallel to this idea here is found in Ps. 69, 29. There the Psalmist prays that the sinners be blotted out from the book of life, and be not inscribed with the righteous. This psalm is recognized by all modern scholars as post-exilic. Other references to this book of Yahwe and kindred ideas, some of them, however, quite obscure, occur in Is. 4, 3; 34, 16; Mai. 3, 16; Ps. 40, 8; 56, 9; 139, 16; and Dan. 12, 1. All these passages without exception are pronounced post-exilic by practically all Biblical schol ars. Some of them are obviously late post-exilic. Clearly therefore the oldest as well as the most explicit Biblical reference to Yahwe's book is this in Ex. 32, 32f. Yet it can not date from a period very much earlier than the other references to the same idea. Its implied doctrine</page><page sequence="18">18 JULIAN MORGENSTERN However, the most positive indication of the date of compo sition of these passages is furnished by the recurrent motif that Yahwe must guard His reputation, both in Israel and among the nations; and although Israel has undoubtedly sinned griev ously, He must nevertheless forgive Israel, not because of any merit on Israel's part, but for two altogether independent con siderations. In the first place, because of His promise to the patriarchs, made to them as a reward of their meritorious deeds, that He would prosper their children and give them the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession, He may not destroy Is rael, no matter how grievously it has sinned. And in the second place, He may not destroy Israel "for His name's sake"; for what would the nations say, and what unjust, but altogether natural and logical, inference would they draw with regard to His lack of power and His bad faith with Israel, should He allow His people to perish? First of all, it should be noted that one striking parallel to this thought that Yahwe's name must be established among the nations, and particularly in Egypt, occurs in the Hexateuch, in Ex. 9, 14-16. These verses are general in their content, and deal with no one specific plague, and manifestly interrupt the continuity of the narrative. In them Moses is made to declare to Pharaoh that the ultimate purpose of all the plagues is, not so much to bring about Israel's deliverance from Egypt, as rather to make the Egyptians realize that there is none like Yahwe in all the land of Egypt. Furthermore, Yahwe might have destroyed Pharaoh long ere this, and has allowed him to continue to exist thus far only in order that Flis name and fame might be heralded throughout the entire earth. This is exactly the same thought that we have encountered so often in the passages already discussed. All scholars are agreed that Ex. of divine reward of righteousness consisting in length of days, and divine punish ment for sin consisting in brevity of days, is fundamental in Deuteronomic theology (cf. Ex.20, 12; Deut. 4, 26,40; 5, 16,33; 6, 2; 11, 9, 21; 17, 20; 22, 7; 25, 15; 30, 18,20; 32, 47). All this evidence points likewise to the conclusion that this J2 passage in Ex. 32, 32f. can not at the very earliest antedate by many years the Deuteronomic period beginning in the last half of the 7th century B. C.</page><page sequence="19">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 19 9, 14-16 are secondary, either the work of J2 or RJE. Probably we need not hesitate in assigning them to the same J 2 writer or writers, as the author of the J2 passages which we have analyzed. Outside of these Hexateuchal passages, the concept or doc trine of the importance of Yahwe's reputation, and that He must act for the sake of His name is met with very frequently in Biblical literature from Jeremiah on. In the earlier literature not a trace of this doctrine can be found. On the contrary, all the earlier, pre-Jeremiah prophets speak uncompromisingly, even though sorrowfully, of Yahwe's complete, or almost complete destruction of Israel for its sins. But with Jeremiah a new note is struck, and we find him pleading with Yahwe, "Even though our transgressions testify against us, O Yahwe, act for the sake of Thy name Dost Thou utterly reject Judah; or dost Thy soul loathe Zion; why hast Thou smitten us, so that there is no healing for us? We expected prosperity, but there is no good, and a time of healing, but behold, dismay! O Yahwe we know our iniquity, and the sin of our fathers; for against Thee have we transgressed. Do not despise us, for Thy name's sake; do not abhor the throne of Thy glory; remember and do not annul Thy covenant with us".34 In Ezekiel this doctrine is developed even further, and in a form practically identical with that in which it is expressed in our Hexateuchal passages. In chapter 20 the prophet reviews the entire course of Israel's history, from the day when Yahwe first chose it for Himself in Egypt unto his own day. He finds that again and again Israel has sinned against Yahwe and has been faithless to Him, in Egypt, in successive generations in the wilderness, in the land of Canaan. And on each occasion Yahwe's first impulse was to destroy Israel completely for its iniquities. But second thought always prevailed; and despite Israel's unquestioned sin and well merited punishment, "I acted for My name's sake, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, in whose midst they (Israel) were, before whose eyes I had revealed Myself to them, in order to bring them 34 Jer. 14, 7 and 19-21.</page><page sequence="20">20 JULIAN MORGENSTERN forth from the land of Egypt."35 Quite similarly Deutero Isaiah says, "For My name's sake I postpone My anger in order not to cut thee off."36 In the post-exilic literature the doctrine finds frequent expression and considerable ampli fication.37 And as for the second motif, that Yah we must forgive Israel because of the patriarchs and His promise to them, to prosper them and give them the land of Canaan as an everlasting pos session,38 the earliest Biblical reference thereto, outside of the passages which we have considered, is Deut. 9, 5 and 26ff. There the thought is expressed, that not because of Israel's righteousness and merit is Yahwe giving it the land of Canaan as a possession, but rather partly because of the iniquity of the nations dwelling there before Israel, and partly to fulfill the word which He swore to the patriarchs. And then the passage concludes, "And I prayed to Yahwe, and said, '0 Yahwe, do not destroy Thy people and Thy possession, whom Thou has redeemed through Thy greatness, whom Thou didst bring forth from Egypt with a strong hand. Remember Thy servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; turn not to the stubborness of this people, nor to its iniquity nor its transgression, lest the land, whence Thou didst bring them forth should say, " Because Yahwe was unable to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because of His hatred of them, has He brought them forth, to let them die in the wilderness." For they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast brought forth in Thy great strength and with Thine outstretched arm' ". The argu ment of this prayer and its purpose are exactly the same as those of Moses' intercession with Yahwe in the passages which 33 Ez. 20, 9; cf. w. 14, 22 and 44.; cf. also 35, 16-36; 39, 1-7. Cf. like wise Jer. 32, 16ff. (a secondary passage, probably the work of the editor of Jeremiah, rather than of the prophet himself), for a similar formulation of the thought. 3« Is. 48,9. 37 Cf. in particular I Ki, 8,41-43 and II Chron. 6, 32f.; Mal. 1, 11 and 14; Ps. 25, 11; 31, 4; 102, 16; 106, 8; 109, 21; Dan. 9, 15. 33 This thought developed in Jewish theology into the important doctrine of "the merit of the fathers".</page><page sequence="21">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 21 we have considered. And as vv. 22f. indicate, this prayer is intended as a reproduction of the general theme of Moses' prayers to Yahwe in the above passages. The same thought occurs again in II Ki. 13, 23. This verse tells that Yahwe did not permit the complete destruction of Israel by Hazael, but showed mercy and favor unto them because of His covenant with the patriarchs. And the Book of Micah concludes with a similar thought, that because of His oath to the fathers in the days of old, Yahwe will forgive Israel and not visit upon it the deserved punishment for its sins; and at the same time He will set His fear upon the nations. All these three passages are exilic or post-exilic. And one further consideration. Jer. 15,1 represents Yahwe as saying to the prophet, "Even if Moses and Samuel would stand before me, I would have no compassion upon this people." This utterance obviously rests upon the tradition which must have been current in the prophet's day, that Moses and Samuel had enjoyed unusual influence with Yahwe, and were wont to sway Him in His decisions by their counsel and prayers. At the bottom of this tradition lay the popular belief, seemingly especially strong in the prophet's day, that certain particular persons, recognized generally as favorites of Yahwe, and therefore enjoying especial influence with Him, could move Him by their prayers and entreaties. The principle finds its most general expression in a passage from E,59 where God says to Abimelech in a dream. "Return the man's wife; for he is a prophet; and let him pray for thee, that thou mayest live." And when Sarah is returned to Abraham he does pray for Abimelech and the latter is healed. In accordance with this tradition, ascribing to Abraham the power of moving the Deity by his prayers to act in accord ance with his views, we find in Gen. 18, 17ff., Abraham sup plicating Yahwe in behalf of the people of Sodom, and arguing with Him in characteristic and effective manner. The basis of his argument is that the Judge of all the earth must do justice; and surely it would not be justice to destroy the entire city, and 3» Gen. 20, 7 and 17.</page><page sequence="22">22 JULIAN MORGENSTERN thus slay whatever righteous people might be therein together with the wicked. Convinced by this argument', Yahwe finally agrees that if only ten righteous men can be found in the city, He will not destroy it, but will spare it for their sake. The theology of this passage is interesting and significant. It is later than Amos, for it rejects absolutely as unjust and un worthy of the God of justice, who is the Judge of all the world, the thought that in the destruction of the sinful city the righteous few who might be found therein should be included. It is much closer to Isaiah's doctrine of the righteous remnant who will in divine justice be saved when God brings upon the wicked nation its merited doom. But it differs in one essential and sig nificant respect from Isaiah's doctrine. The latter sees no hope of escape and salvation for the sinful portion of the nation; they must perish utterly; and only the small, righteous group, con sisting of the prophet and his disciples, will be saved and re turn. In contradiction of this doctrine, Abraham's intercession with Yahwe advances the claim that the merits of the very few righteous can and should compensate for and avert the well deserved punishment of the wicked many; it is a doctrine, not of vicarious atonement, but of vicarious salvation, far removed indeed from Isaiah's thought. Certainly it is a later development than Isaiah's doctrine; for obviously had not that been promul gated first, with its original and clear-cut distinction between the righteous and the wicked groups within the nation, this latter doctrine could never have been conceived. The nearest approach in the Bible to the principle under lying Abraham's argument is to be found in Ezek. 14, 14ff.,4° where the Deity is represented as informing the prophet that Israel's corruption is such that even the righteousness of Noah, Daniel and Job could suffice only to save themselves, but could not redeem the people from their merited and sure destruction.41 And another approach to this thought may be seen in the above 4° As Skinner has pointed out, Genesis, 305. «' At first sight this passage seems to reject the doctrine of vicarious salvation; but this is more seeming than real. Actually the passage affirms the doctrine in a general way, for it seems to say by implication that ordinarily the righteousness of these three perfect men might have effected vicarious</page><page sequence="23">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 23 mentioned doctrine of "the merit of the fathersviz. that Yahwe must spare Israel because of the righteousness of the patriarchs and His promise, made to them as the reward therefore, to make of their descendants a people great and mighty, the recipients of His unending protection and favor. But, as is perfectly clear, and as has been already intimated in the case of the latter doctrine, both of these considerations are comparatively late, certainly not earlier than the beginning of the Babylonian Exile, or, at the very earliest, shortly antedating this. Likewise, the theory of universalism of Gen. 18, 17ff., is comparatively late. Yahwe is pictured here as the Judge of all the earth in the absolute and disinterested sense, rather than in the relative sense that His primary interest and concern are in and for Israel, which we find in Amos. Abraham's broad sympathy and solicitude for the welfare of the non-Israelite people of Sodom approximate the prophetic thought of the exilic and post-exilic period, as reflected in Deutero-Isaiah, Ruth and Jonah, rather than in pre-exilic literature. An analysis of Gen. 18 establishes beyond all question that the verses recounting Abraham's intercession with Yahwe on behalf of the people of Sodom disturb the continuity of the main narrative and have no essential unity with it. Very clearly they are a late insertion into the main narrative, and the product, in all likelihood, of the exilic period at the very earliest. That they are Yahwistic in character is agreed to by all scholars, and is beyond question. We must therefore set them down as the work of some J 2 writer, who manifestly belonged to the same theological and literary school as the author or authors of the various Moses traditions which we have analyzed. Clearly then the picture of Moses and Abraham as the effective intercessors with Yahwe, who by their prayers and arguments can divert Him from His first, ill-advised purposes to a program far more in accord with His dignity, honor and justice, proceeded from one and the same late group of Yah wistic theologians and writers. And it is apparent that their salvation ; but in this particular case Israel's sin is so extreme that the righteous ness of even these three saints could not counterbalance it; therefore vicarious salvation is now out of the question.</page><page sequence="24">24 24 JULIAN MORGENSTERN additions to and reediting of the older J Code were of quite considerable extent, far greater than is usually imagined.42 Similar powers of praying to Yahwe on behalf of others, and inducing Him to conform to the wishes expressed, were enjoyed, according to the Biblical traditions, by Elisha;43 and apparently in his own day Jeremiah himself enjoyed a like reputation.44 But above all others, it seems, according to Biblical tradition, that this power was possessed in the extreme degree by Moses and Samuel,45 just as Jer. 15, 1 implies. Samuel's high reputation in this direction is evidenced by I Sam. 7, 5; 8, 6; 12, 19 and 23. And Moses' powers of intercession with Yahwe are indicated in 4נ This raises an interesting and important question, viz. if we are com pelted to posit for these J2 writers and editors, as all the cumulative evidence indicates,־ a date at the very earliest not much before the time of Jeremiah, and perhaps even somewhat later, then we shall have to alter radically the generally accepted date of the composition of the J Code, and perhaps also that of the E Code as well, and of their being eventually edited together as JE. We shall then have to claim for all this literary activity a date either pre ceding but little the Babylonian Exile or not improbably even reaching into it. This conclusion, however, would solve a number of significant problems, such as the very pronounced universalism of the J portions of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, and the unmistakable relationship of the thought and doctrine of these and other manifestly late passages in J with the thought and doctrine of Deutero-Isaiah. (For the thesis that Deutero-Isaiah lived and wrote in Palestine cf. Maynard, "The Home of Deutero-Isaiah", JBL XXXVI (1917), 213-224; Buttenwieser, "Where Did Deutero-Isaiah Live?", JBL XXXVII (1918), 94-112). This would account in the most reasonable and satisfactory way possible for the Babylonian affinities of the J, as well as of the P, portions of Gen. 1-11. « II Ki. 4, 33; 5, 11; 6, 17f. Similar powers are ascribed to the anony mous prophet of Judah (I Ki. 13, 6) and to Job (Job 42, 8fL). « Cf. Jer. 7, 16; 11, 14; 32, 16; 37, 3; 42, 2, 4, and 20. « « And, as we have seen, by Abraham also. The fact that Jer. 15, 1 does not mention Abraham, too, may perhaps indicate that the tradition that Abraham also possessed these powers to such a high degree, developed at a time later than the composition of Jer. 15, 1. This would accord with the suggestion made above, that the J2 writings, or at least portions thereof, are the product of the period either immediately preceding or else extending into the Babylonian Exile.</page><page sequence="25">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 25 Num. 12, 13ff.; 21, 7 ;46 Deut. 9, 20 and 26ff., in addition to the passages which we have previously analyzed.47 Now it is noteworthy that of all these passages here cited, in which the belief in the ability of the "man of God" to in fluence, and even to reverse Yahwe's intentions, only one, viz. that in Gen. 20, 7 and 17, which, as we have said, comes from E, can possibly be older than the passages which we have under consideration.48 All the other passages without exception were composed either during the Babylonian Exile, or at the very earliest, but shortly before it. Moreover, the amply attested fact that Jeremiah enjoyed a considerable popular reputation as an effective intercéder with Yahwe, and the reference to Moses and Samuel in Jer. 15, 1 evidence the wide currency of this belief in his day. Inasmuch as I Sam. 7, 5; 8, 6 and 12, 19, 23 are certainly Deuteronomic, they must be later than Jer. 15, 1. Consequently the reference to Samuel there can not be dependent upon the particular tradition recorded in these passages in I Sam., but must instead mirror the popular conception of Samuel in Jeremiah's day, which in time gave rise to the particular traditions recorded in these passages of I Sam. On the other hand the reference to Moses in Jer. 15, 1 may depend not merely upon a similar popular conception of him current in Jeremiah's day, but more specifically upon these very traditions and narratives recorded in the J2 passages. Certainly all our passages are older than Deut. 9, 26 ff. for the almost literal quotations there from Ex. 32, 12; 33, 13; and Num. 14, 16 are unmistakable.49 In other words the composition of these passages must antedate somewhat the Babylonian Exile, and presumably also the composition and the utterance of Jer. 4s Both these passages are assigned by practically all modern scholars to E, although on grounds which seem quite insufficient, and which speak just as strongly for J authorship. 4' Here we have the explanation of the oft-repeated motif, which we have noted in the passages which we have analyzed, of Moses finding favor in Yahwe's eyes. It is this favor which he enjoys to such a high degree, that enables him to intercede with Yahwe so daringly, and even presumptuously, and also so successfully. 48 And, as we have just intimated, it may not be much older. 44 Cf. Gray, Numbers (International Critical Commentary), 155.</page><page sequence="26">26 JULIAN MORGENSTERN 15, 1. On the other hand, they must be later than Is. 6, 3, for the dépendance of Num. 14, 21 upon that passage is self apparent. In fact the whole conception of Yahwe with the shin ing face, upon which no mortal, with the single exception of Moses, dare look, which reached its culmination in Ezekiel's figure of the Kebod Yahwe, seems to be a development out of the simpler, almost germinal picture of Yahwe in the Temple, a radiant being, seated upon a throne, and surrounded by seraphim, and the whole Temple filled with smoke, and no mortal daring to gaze upon Him, of Is. 6. But if so, it represents a quite con siderable development from this earliest picture, and one that could hardly have come about in a short space of time. This fact, coupled with the reference to Moses in Jer. 15, 1, with the additional fact that in Jeremiah's day the belief in the power of certain favored individuals like Moses, Samuel and Jeremiah to intercede with Yahwe and induce Him to change His purposes and forego His intentions, and with the further fact that in this day the theological principle that Yahwe must act for His name's sake, and even go so far as to forgive Israel for its many sins and remit its well-merited punishment in order to preserve His reputation among the nations, and finally the presence in these passages of the earliest expression of the later theological doctrine of the "merit of the fathers", all these facts point to a time antedating but very little, if at all, the ut terances of Jeremiah, as the most probable period of composition of our J2 passages. In other words, we may with reasonable certainty fix the last half, or perhaps even the last quarter, of the 7th century B. C. as the time of the composition of the group of Hexateuchal passages which we have considered. It is quite clear that in the century, more or less, that in tervened between the earliest period of J writing50 and the composition of these passages, the figure of Moses had expanded in characteristic, legendary manner. From a simple, mortal being, endowed with powers but little above the average, and in some respects, as for example in the gift'of speech, even below the average, who achieved only through Yahwe's constant S» Circa 800-740 B. C.</page><page sequence="27">MOSES WITH THE SHINING FACE 27 help and encouragement and even insistence, Moses has developed into a being that transcends all the powers and bounds of or dinary mortality, who plans and achieves through his own wis dom and might, whose face shines almost like Yahwe's with a radiance that defies all mortal vision, and who ventures again and again to counsel Yahwe, to point out, with greater foresight and vision than Yahwe Himself possesses, consequences of His intended actions, which He Himself had not anticipated, and even on occasion to correct and rebuke Him and to reject His proferred favor uncompromisingly. This Moses is no longer a mere mortal ; he has become almost a demi-god. Moses with the shining face is indeed a most interesting and significant figure of early Jewish legend,51 and marks in a way the beginning of that long and fas cinating development which we find in the later Aggada. 51 Apparently legend began to play with the figure of Samuel in much the same way. At least so the reference in Jer. IS, 1 and the traditions in the Deuteronomic portions of I Samuel would indicate. But seemingly the figure of Samuel did not lend itself well to legend; at any rate the development in this direction was not great. Obviously the figures of Elijah and Elisha, and more particularly the former, loaned themselves much better to legendary expansion, so that Elijah became, second only to Moses, a favorite figure in Jewish legend. In this connection it is interesting to note the association of Elijah with Moses in the legend of the transfiguration of Jesus (Mat. 17, 3ff. ; Mark 9,4ff.; Luke 9,30ff.). According to the version of Luke, Moses and Elijah appear "in glory", while the face of Jesus and his raiment and whole ap pearance become white and dazzling. It is clear that this is a very remark able expansion of the early legend of Moses with the shining face. It may be noted also in passing that another interesting development of the concept of Yahwe with the radiant countenance, is the idea that he upon whom Yahwe would let His countenance shine would enjoy His favor; cf. the priestly blessing (Num. 6.25), "May Yahwe let his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee".</page></plain_text>
