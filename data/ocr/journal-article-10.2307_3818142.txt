<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas Paine, Edward Nares, and Mrs. Piozzi's Marginalia By MARJORIE NICOLSON I "^HE Huntington Library possesses a rare copy of a work,1 important in its day though now almost forgotten, which is made doubly interesting by the marginal comment of Mrs. Hester Lynch Piozzi. To a generation no longer concerned with theology, its very title seems forbidding: 'EI2 OEOS, 'EI2 ME2ITH2; or, An Attempt to Shew How Far the Philosophical Notion of a Plural? ity of Worlds Is consistent, or not so, with the Language of the Holy Scriptures. Yet in its day ? it was published in 1801 ?this title was highly significant, since it reflected a perennial problem which the "new astronomy" of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had again made acute; and other readers than Mrs. Piozzi were aware that this volume, one of the many called forth by the publica? tion in 1794 of Thomas Paine's Age of Reason, occupied an important place among the ephemeral literature occasioned by that tract, as one of the few replies to Paine which really faced the fundamental problem he attacked, and as an attempt by an obviously sincere theologian, who was at the same time well-read in contemporary theories of science, to reconcile belief in the Scriptures with belief in the new cosmos that astronomy had exhibited to man. In addition to the interest which this particular volume inspired in contemporary read? ers, its author ? then comparatively unknown ? was to become in a decade one of the most popular writers of his generation, thanks to the publication of another anonymous work of a very different sort. 1 My attention was first called to this volume by Mr. Robert O. Schad, Curator of Rare Books at the Huntington Library.</page><page sequence="2">104 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN I The interest aroused by the theological volume, indicated by the number of inquiries received by the publishers concerning its author, led them, within a short time, to insert a new title-page,1 bearing the name of the author, the Rev. Edward Nares, D.D., Rector of Bidden- den, later for twenty-eight years Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, whose chief claim to fame at this period of his life had con? sisted in his romantic marriage with Lady Charlotte Spencer, third daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, who, from the time she chose life in the secluded village rectory, never entered Blenheim again.2 The broad interests of the "versatile professor," as his only biog? rapher has called him, led Nares at every period of his life to trim his sails to all the winds that blew. When in 1783-84 the balloon ascents of the brothers Montgolfier startled the world, and when those as? cents were followed by the efforts of Blanchard and Dr. Jefferies to cross the Straits of Dover, Nares expressed his interest in the theme of flight in an epic poem of four cantos and one thousand lines, The Bal- looniad, which was widely read, and was translated into French for the amusement of the Dauphin.3 In 1785 Nares published in the Morning Chronicle a long poem on the same subject, designed for New Year's 1 Mrs. Piozzi's copy, at the Huntington Library, is one of the early issue, bearing the original title-page, without the authors name. The insertion of the new title-page probably explains the allusion in Robert Watt, Bibliotheca Britannica (Edinburgh, 1824), II, 694 x, to an edition of 1802. Only one edition of the work was published. 2 The account and letters given by G. Cecil White, A Versatile Professor: Reminiscences of the Rev. Edward Nares, D.D. (London, 1903), pp. 130 ff., show that the marriage was not, as suggested in the Dictionary of National Biography and elsewhere, an elopement. It was reluctantly permitted by the family, and a settlement made upon Lady Charlotte; but, since the Marlborough family refused to include her husband in their invitations to their daughter, Lady Charlotte refused to return to Blenheim, even as a guest. 3 One of the most popular of the many works occasioned by the balloon ascents of 1793- 94, The Ballooniad has become excessively rare. No copy is listed in the British Museum Catalogue, nor is there one in the Aeronautical Collection of the Library of Congress. J. E. Hodgson, in The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain (London, 1924), says (p. 194): "The writer is aware of only one copy of the rare pamphlet . . . kindly lent him by Dr. F. J. Poynton. It is the second edition, and has an additional Third Canto." The Harvard College Library, however, possesses a copy of a second edition: The Ballooniad, in two cantos. Second edition (Birmingham, 1785). The work is not mentioned in such standard bibliogra? phies as those of Tissandier, Wouwermans, Venturini, and Boffito, nor is it listed among the items described in catalogues on The History of Flight issued by Maggs Brothers.</page><page sequence="3">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZI'S MARGINALIA 105 Day, in the form of a dialogue between "Eighteen-Ninety-Five" and " Eighteen-Ninety-Six," in which he suggests certain aspects of the stimulus which the new aviation had given to imagination.1 It is not really incongruous that the man who wrote The Ballooniad and this trifle should have written a disquisition on the plurality of worlds, or that he should have delivered the Bampton Lectures at Oxford, in 1805, on The Evidences of Christianity,2 for, as will be seen, both 'EI2 0EO2 and the Bampton Lectures (which were a further de? velopment of the same theme) were written in response to current interest in provocative subjects; and Nares throughout his life re? sponded to the contemporary and the controversial. His semisatirical Heraldic Anomalies,1 as well, was directed at fads and foibles of the day. It is somewhat more difficult to explain his magnum opus, a three-volume work on William Cecil, Lord Burghley,4 the very length of which suggests a perseverance and an assiduity of which his other works give no hint. Its length, indeed, was chiefly responsible for the violence of the attack Macaulay launched upon it in the Edinburgh Review,s which begins: The work of Dr Nares has filled us with astonishment similar to that which Captain Lemuel Gulliver felt when first he landed in Brobdingnag, and saw corn as high as the oaks in the New Forest, thimbles as large as buckets, and wrens of the bulk of turkeys. The whole book, and every component part of it, is on a gigantic scale.... We cannot sum up the merits of the stupendous mass of paper which lies before us, better than by saying, that it consists of about two thousand closely printed pages, that it oc? cupies fifteen hundred inches, cubic measure, and that it weighs sixty pounds avoirdupois. Such a book might, before the deluge, have been 1 Extracts from the poem are given by White, op. cit., pp. 42-46.

But unhappily the life of man is now threescore years and ten.1 Macaulay's censure is just enough: garrulity, which had always been one of Nares's characteristics, had grown upon him with the years. That very delight in loquacious trivialities had perhaps been responsi? ble for the phenomenal success of the one book which, twenty years before the Memoirs, had made him famous. The modern reader who today picks up that" serio-ludicro, tragico-comico tale," Thinks-I-To- Myself* may well ponder upon changing fashions, and wonder what qualities in the tale (which, less a novel than a succession of verbose conversations, jests, verses, and reflections, drags its slow length along) could account for the fact that Thinks-I-To-Myself swept Eng? land and America, went through edition after edition,3 was read by royalty and the populace alike, and became for a time the favorite topic of conversation of learned judges and bishops. Perhaps the explanation is to be found in a comment which Ma- caulay made upon the Memoirs: "His book is swelled to its vast di? mensions by endless repetitions, by episodes which have nothing to do with the main action, by quotations from books which are in every circulating library, and by reflections which, when they happen to be just, are so obvious that they must necessarily occur to the mind of every reader." 4 To our generation the salt has lost its savor; but to the generation for which the tale was written, these seemed witty re? flections by that columnist of his age, "Thinks-I-To-Myself," who surveyed the passing scene, and, mildly in the manner of Tristram Shandy, commented upon it as it passed. "Thinks-I-To-Myself" was the average man of his period, raised to the nt\v degree; his reflec? tions seemed for the moment universal. So clearly did the age find itself in these pages, that the printers worked even on Sundays to keep 1 Nares replied to Macaulay in A Few Observations on the Edinburgh Review of Dr. Nares's Memoirs of Lord Burghley . . . in a letter from the author of that work (London, 1832). 2 Thinks-I-To-Myself.

II Of all these fugitive pieces of Nares, 'EI2 6E02 remains the most interesting to the modern reader, not only in itself, for it is on the whole free from the tedious loquacity of his later works and shows his early ability to attack a subject vigorously and firmly; not only be? cause it takes us back to one of the great periods of controversy be? tween religion and science, which has not yet ceased; but chiefly because Nares was among the few contemporary commentators upon Thomas Paine's Age of Reason who saw ? what our generation misses as frequently as did the earlier ? the real basis of Paine's "deism." It is extraordinary, indeed, that the majority of Paine's ardent dis? ciples, as well as his antagonists, have failed to understand the chief source of his theological beliefs. And yet Paine himself exerted every effort to make that source clear in the first part of the Age of Reason, which he published in 1794.4 Only in the later additions, to which he was forced by the reception of the first part, particularly among the orthodox theologians, did he depart from presuppositions which had 1 / Says, Says I.

The first part of the Age of Reason ? and this point seems to have been missed by all Paine's biographers x ? is the climactic and inevitable popularizing of a controversy 2 which, as old as human thinking, had returned with new violence in Giordano Bruno; which had received fresh ammunition, as both Kepler and Campanella realized, when Galileo's telescopic observations were reported in the Sidereus Nuncius in 1610; which was faced by Robert Burton in the Anatomy of Melancholy; which grew and spread during the seventeenth century until it became an accepted figure of speech in eighteenth- century poetry, and the basis of much eighteenth-century philosophy; which was given new impetus by the discoveries of Herschel: the con? troversy whether ours is not merely one of a plurality ? even, some dared to think, of an infinity ? of worlds, whether the Creator has not poured himself forth with lavish and with unrestraining hand in an indefinite or possibly infinite series of universes, and whether each of these universes may not possess rational inhabitants.3 There is nothing new in what Paine has to say of this problem, in the Age of Reason. His "millions of other worlds, . . . invisible by their dis? tance";4 his "infinity of space . . . filled with worlds";5 his "im- 1 Moncure Daniel Conway, The Life of Thomas Paine (London, 1893), II, 217, mentions, in a footnote, Paine's interest in astronomy, and remarks in the text that "the first part of the Age of Reason is largely astronomical/' but makes no allusion to the background of thought. The most recent biography of Paine, Mary Agnes Best, Prophet and Martyr of Democracy (New York, 1927), pays no attention to the influence of science on him. 2 I have attempted to develop in some detail the seventeenth-century background of these ideas (which I here treat in a cursory fashion), in a series of studies: "The Telescope and Imagination/' Modern Philology, XXXII (1935), 233-60; "The 'New Astronomy* and English Literary Imagination," Studies in Philology, XXXII (1935), 428-62; "Milton and the Telescope," E.L.H., A Journal of English Literary History, II (1935), 1-32; "A World in the Moon," in Smith College Studies in Modern Languages, XLVII (Jan., 1936), 1-72; and "The Microscope and English Imagination," in Smith College Studies in Modern Languages, XVI (July, 1935), 1-92. 3 I have suggested the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century background of this belief in the inhabitability of other worlds, in" A World in the Moon," mentioned above. In the seven? teenth century, the moon was considered the other inhabited world; but, in the eighteenth century, interest shifted from the moon to the planets, after scientists had definitely de? termined-the unhabitableness of the moon. 4 Age of Reason, p. 25. s Ibid., p. 34.</page><page sequence="7">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 109 mensity of space in which it [our world] is suspended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air";x his belief that ours is "only one of a system of worlds, of which the universal creation is composed"2 ? all these were Paine's heritage, not from classical philosophy (for which he had little sympathy), but from two centuries of telescopic observation and discovery. These ideas had come to him, not only from close study of books of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but from his own practical experience in that subject which he considered far more fit? ting for the education of the young than the "dead" languages ? science.3 "The natural bent of my mind was to science," he declares;4 and he tells us that, when he was not permitted to follow that bent in his own education^ he purchased a pair of globes, attended the lec? tures of Martin and Ferguson,5 put himself to school informally to Dr. Bevis,6 and studied astronomy as best he could, following avidly the new discoveries reported to the Royal Society. While astronomy obviously held first place in Paine's mind, he did not neglect other phases of natural science. The telescope had opened to him, as to two generations of his predecessors, a new, vast cosmic universe; but the microscope, too, had played its part in stimulating his imagination. Like Pascal in the seventeenth century, Paine had turned from the cosmic system exhibited by the celestial bodies, to that other "new infinity," the crowded, teeming universe of the mi? nute. With Leibniz, he came to realize the existence of a universe infinitely full of all compossibles. He writes: If we take a survey of our own world, or rather of this, of which the Creator has given us the use, as our portion in the immense system of crea- 1 Ibid., p. 41 - * Ibid. 3 Cf. his attack on contemporary education, with his desire to put science in the place of classical languages.

James Ferguson was particularly known for his Astronomy Explain1 don Sir Isaac Newton's Principles (1756), a work which ran through many editions. Benjamin Martin was almost equally well known for his Micrographia Nova (1742) and his Philosophia Britannica (1747). 6 Dr. John Be vis (or Be vans), a physician as well as an astronomer, was the compiler of Uranographia Britannica and the author of Tabulae Astronomicae (1749). An English edition of the latter appeared in 1752. He also published many papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.</page><page sequence="8">no HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN tion, we find every part of it, the earth, the waters, and the air that sur? round it, filled, and, as it were, crouded with life, down from the largest animals that we know of, to the smallest insects the naked eye can behold, and from thence to others still smaller, and totally invisible without the assistance of the microscope. Every tree, every plant,1 every leaf, serves not only as an habitation, but as a world to some numerous race, till animal existence becomes so exceedingly refined, that effluvia of a blade of grass would be food for thousands.2 A century before, Fontenelle's "Philosopher," in an earlier work on the theme of a plurality of worlds and in almost the same terms, had described the fulness of the universe to a lady in a rose garden; Leeuwenhoek had reported to the sympathetic Royal Society his dis? covery of animalcules, and had given the first great impetus to the science of microbiology; Leibniz had made of the new telescopic as? tronomy and the new microscopical biology a consistent cosmic philos? ophy; Swift had satirized, while immortalizing them in Gulliver s Travels, the discoveries of the telescope and the microscope; Pope, Thomson, and Young had expressed in verse which resounded for many years in the ears of the eighteenth century, the same picture of a full, coherent universe. From this expanded universe, "where all must full, or not coherent be," Pope indeed, with one group of deists, had turned back to our own world: Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho* the God be known, Tis ours to trace him only in our own. Too vast a cosmos staggers comprehension; and it is a legitimate con? clusion, to one type of mind, that "the proper study of mankind is Man." But Thomas Paine, with his group, reached another conclu? sion from the same premises. To him, the proper study of mankind remained the God of the new telescopic universe. Paine's own words in the Age of Reason show clearly the effect of scientific discoveries upon his religious beliefs: After I had made myself master of the use of the globes, and of the orrery, and conceived an idea of the infinity of space, and of the eternal divisibility 1 The first issue of the Paris-London edition of 1794 reads "planet" ? an obvious mis? print. 2 Age of Reason, p. 41.</page><page sequence="9">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZFS MARGINALIA III of matter, and obtained, at least, a general knowledge of what is called natural philosophy, I began to compare, or, as I have before said, to con? front, the internal evidence those things afford with the Christian system of faith.1 That "evidence" was to Paine conclusive proof of the existence of a plurality of worlds ? the central doctrine upon which the Age of Reason is founded: Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is it to be sup? posed, that the immensity of space is a naked void, lying in eternal waste. There is room for millions of worlds as large or larger than ours, and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.2 But this, immense as it is, is only one system of worlds. Beyond this, at a vast distance into space, far beyond all power of calculation, are the stars called the fixed stars. . . . The probability therefore is, that each of those fixed stars is also a Sun, round which another system of worlds or planets, though too remote for us to discover, performs its revolutions, as our system of worlds does round our central Sun. By this easy progression of ideas, the immensity of space will appear to us to be filled with systems of worlds; and that no part of space lies at waste, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left un? occupied.3 From this vision of the expanded cosmos, Paine does not, like some of the earlier thinkers, shrink back in terror or in loneliness. Rather, he conceives among his worlds interrelationships which suggest cer? tain aspects of his political theories: "The solitary idea of a solitary world rolling, or at rest, in the immense ocean of space, gives place to the chearful idea of a society of worlds, so happily contrived, as to administer, even by their motion, instruction to man." 4 Such a so? ciety of worlds bespeaks to Paine the "almighty power of the Crea- 1 Age of Reason, pp. 39-40.

His is a Creator whose power and goodness have grown in man's mind as has the vast universe in which he has expressed himself. "Our ideas, not only of the almightiness of the Creator, but of his wisdom and his beneficence, become enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the extent and the structure of the universe." x The "one God" of Paine's confession of faith is no anthropomorphic Jehovah, but a deity whose goodness and power express themselves in the vastness of the cosmic order which he has created. Paine wrote, "I know, . . . that there is a power supe? rior to all those things, and that power is God." 2 Granted the loftiness of Paine's conception of the deity ? and certainly no modern reader, separated by more than a century from the dust and heat of controversy, will deny it ? what was there, in the Age of Reason, to shock the generation as it did? What was in? volved in the conception of a plurality of worlds that seemed to shake the foundations of accepted theology? Paine himself makes that clear; and, though the realization is in no way original with him, it was he who made his period aware of the ultimate effect of belief in a plurality of worlds, with its vast conception of cosmic universes, upon orthodox theology: Though it is not a direct article of the Christian system that this world that we inhabit is the whole of the habitable creation, yet it is so worked up therewith, from what is called the Mosaic account of the creation, the story of Eve and the apple, and the counterpart of that story, the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwise, that is, to believe that God created a plurality of worlds, at least as numerous as what we call stars, renders the Christian system of faith at once little and ridiculous; and scatters it in the mind like feathers in the air. The two beliefs cannot be held together in the same mind; and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.71 To believe in a plurality of worlds was to deny, then, not only the validity of Scripture, but, even more, the sacrifice of Christ ? such is 1 Ibid., pp. 45-46. 2 Ibid., p. 25. 3 Ibid., p. 40. The italics are mine.</page><page sequence="11">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 113 Paine's conclusion, which echoed so loudly in the ears of an outraged generation that it forgot the premises from which that conclusion was drawn. Paine was by no means unique among the deists in drawing such a conclusion: as the deistic movement had grown and developed, its adherents, always stressing universality in religion, had expanded their conception of cosmopolitanism to cosmic proportions.1 No re? ligion could be ultimately satisfactory which was limited by either time or place to one group, one race, even ? as the "new astronomy" developed the idea of other inhabited worlds ? to one planet or one series of worlds. Of all the stumblingblocks that the deists encoun? tered in Scripture, the chief was less the first chapter of Genesis (as had been the case in the warfare between science and religion in the seventeenth century) than the New Testament dogma of the sacrifice of Christ. Paine puts the position clearly when he says: ... it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the benefits arising from a plurality of worlds are limited. The inhabitants of each of the worlds, of which our system is composed, enjoy the same opportunities of knowledge as we do. . . . ... in the midst of those reflections, what are we to think of the Chris? tian system of faith that forms itself upon the idea of only one world, . . . From whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all the rest, and come to die in our world, because, they say, one man and one woman had eaten an apple. And, on the other hand, are we to suppose that every world, in the boundless creation, had an Eve, an apple, a serpent, and a redeemer. In this case, the person who is irreverently called the Son of God, and sometimes God himself, would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death, with scarcely a momentary interval of life.2 This was irreverence and blasphemy to the orthodox; but to Paine, as to many others, it was a logical and inevitable conclusion from indis? putable scientific premises. There is nothing here which had not been said before, but the time was ripe, the audience unconsciously ready. 1 The background of deism, from this point of view, has been treated by A. O.Lovejoy, "Optimism and Romanticism,'/' PMLA, XLII, 921-46 (Dec, 1927). See also his "Parallel between Deism and Classicism," Modern Philology, XXIX, 281-99 (Feb., 1932). 2 Age of Reason, pp. 45-46.</page><page sequence="12">n4 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN The vigor and frankness of Paine's reasoning; the rhetoric of his great paean of praise to the vast expanded cosmos and its Creator; the keen popular interest in science, which had prepared many minds for all but the inevitable conclusion ? these conspired to make the Age of Reason one of those shots heard round the world in the battle between science and religion. One fearful group of the orthodox covered their heads and waited, shuddering, for the hurled thunderbolt to strike dead the atheist; the other group set themselves busily to forging their own thunderbolts. Ill No complete bibliography of the replies to, and defenses of, Paine's Age of Reason has been compiled. The Catalogue of the British Museum lists more than fifty works occasioned by it, between 1784 and 1830, of which twenty-three appeared during the first three years after publication of the first part of Paine's work. These are only books and pamphlets which specifically declare their origin; the number would be at least doubled were one to consider also those works which, while taking their departure from Paine, do not men? tion him. For the most part, the replies confine themselves to attacks upon Paine's "blasphemy," to his interpretation of Scripture and his treatment of miracles and revelation, or to the place of "mystery" in the interpretation of religion.1 Few of them consider his astronomical arguments. There are exceptions to this generalization, to be sure. Richard Carlile, Paine's publisher, who defended him in his trial, not unnaturally shows himself fully aware of the basis of Paine's disbelief in revelation; and, in his defense, not only develops Paine's ideas in regard to the place of science in the education of the young, but insists that " the use of the telescope and the advanced state of the science of Astronomy has given us ocular and mathematical demonstration" of the truth of Paine's conjectures.2 Some of Paine's adversaries, too, 1 The Huntington Library possesses eighteen of the tracts which specifically state that they were written in defense of, or attack upon, Paine, with a number of the other volumes which, while they do not mention Paine, reflect the controversy clearly. My generalizations in this section are based upon an examination of twenty-five such volumes. 2 An Address to Men of Science: Calling upon them to stand forward and Vindicate the Truth from the Foul Grasp and Persecution of Superstition. . . .

The Rev. Uzal Ogden, of Newark, New Jersey, in his two- volume reply to Paine, discusses at some length the conception of a plurality of worlds; in one place he attempts to correct Paine's mathe? matics in order to show that what Paine has to say of celestial dis? tances is incorrect.1 Ogden does not for a moment deny that there may be other inhabited worlds;2 but he points out that we have no evi? dence that the rational inhabitants of these other worlds "were originally in a probationary state; that they have abused their moral agency and incurred the displeasure of their creator." 3 We alone, in a vast series of universes, Ogden declares, may be the only offenders for whom the mediation of Christ was necessary; behold and see, he seems to exult with a Calvinistic fervor, if there be any sin like to our sin! Some critics attempted to keep both the idea of a plurality of worlds and the belief in revelation, by finding "other worlds" implied in the Bible.4 Some beg the question raised by cosmic philosophy by insisting that, since we can prove nothing concerning the existence of other inhabited worlds, we must confine our speculations "to this globe only that we inhabit, and proceed upon matters of fact, which are stubborn things";s straining at the gnat of astronomy, they swallow the camel of revelation. Still others, like Samuel Stilwell, take refuge in irony: "Upon a survey of the whole, if you embrace Mr. Paine's system of religion, it will be necessary for you to furnish yourselves with a pair of globes, a microscope and telescope, and every necessary apparatus to find out the principles and properties of a triangle; and then apply yourself to the use of these to gain the true knowledge of God and your own duties." 6 But none, either of Paine's disciples or adversaries, treats Paine's 1 Antidote to Deism.

Indeed, Nares shows real respect for the religion of the deists, even those who have attacked the central tenet of the Christian faith; he attempts to find the basis of their criticism; he shows a sympathetic appreciation of the theological difficulties they raise; and, finally, he endeavors to explain away what seemed the logi? cal inconsistency, both by his philosophical interpretation of the idea of a plurality of worlds and by his reinterpretation of the scriptural passages in the Old and the New Testament, which Paine and others constantly quoted.2 The central idea of his work is expressed by Nares thus: Among the many objections brought against Christianity, it has been known to be one main offence to Deists, that man should be so arrogant, as to think himself of importance enough in the scale of being, to have a messenger sent from God, expressly to enlighten, and even to redeem him. This that we call our world, say they, is almost now demonstrated to be so small a speck in the universal creation, as might almost escape the very sight of the Creator, if he was not omnipresent. It is at best but a small planet, in one out of myriads of systems; and shall such an insignificant thing as the inhabitant of this atom be so much an object of care and con? cern to the Maker of all these suns and planets and heavenly systems, as to have the course of nature interrupted for his sake, and a messenger sent from the Heaven of Heavens? But how shall we express our horror, they continue, when we are required to believe, that the fulness of God has dwelt among us! Such are their expressions, or at least the purport of them; and it must be admitted, that, to a certain degree, there may appear some justice in them. Man is but a worm of the earth, and the earth probably but a speck 1 The response to Paine which seems to me to approach it most closely is A Series of Discourses on the Christian Revelation, Viewed in Connexion with the Modern Astronomy. By Thomas Chalmers, D.D. (New York, 1818). Chalmers* survey of the effect of astronomy upon the Christian religion, particularly in his first discourse, is extremely competent. He is more orderly in his thinking than is Nares; but he shows no such acquaintance with the history of the idea of a plurality of worlds, nor so much thought upon the subject. In ad? dition, he had had the advantage of Nares*s work. 2 The interpretation of Scripture occupies the second part of the work, pp. 173-404.

PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 117 in the Universe; and God is infinite, and not the maker of man only, or the planet he inhabits, but of myriads and myriads of such worlds as this, and perhaps of myriads and myriads of different and distinct races of intelligent beings. But, if they will run the race with us, not only for upholding, but for enlarging our ideas of God's infinite perfections and incomprehensible greatness, we are nothing loth to contest the point with them. In the name of that God we both profess to adore, let us, for once at least, unite, in setting forth his glory, and proclaiming aloud "the wonders that he doth for the children of men''. They object to the Christian mediatorial scheme, as inconsistent with the greatness and glory of God. I shall not repeat what they say, or unnecessarily bring to remembrance the many degrading ideas this system is said to present to their minds; but it will be the purpose of this tract to take them up upon their own grounds, and see whether, upon that very foundation, the whole mediatorial scheme may not serve exceedingly to raise and exalt our notions of God's greatness and mag? nificence.1 In this attempt "to take them up upon their own grounds," Nares is led to treat at length three main themes: the conception of a plu? rality of worlds, the nature of God, and the mediation of Christ.2 His discussion of the first affords one of the most competent resumes of the idea of a plurality of worlds to be found up to that period, and his survey of the historical development of the conception indicates the remarkable breadth of reading of the Rector of Biddenden, who was at this period of his life entirely dependent, for his sources, upon his own library.3 In tracing the history of the idea, Nares inclines to dis? count the influence of classical philosophy, although he is aware that some such doctrine was held by a number of early thinkers.4 Having 1 *EI2 BEOS, pp. 12-16. 2 In the discussion of these three topics, I have imposed an order upon Nares which will not be found in the work itself, since Nares is characteristically discursive. Many of his most important arguments are to be found in the long notes and quotations which supple? ment almost every page of the book. 3 He mentions this difficulty several times, apologizing for paraphrases rather than direct quotations, or acknowledging that he has not been able to read a book to which he refers, because it is not in his library. He also mentions, in one of his letters (quoted, White, op. cit., pp. 147-48), the assistance of Lady Charlotte Nares in finding illustrative material for him. 4 Cf. *EI2 BEOS, pp. 81-82: "The doctrine of a plurality of worlds, as to the mere terms, is certainly very old; but the ancient philosophers had such strange notions about their substance and condition, that except, perhaps, as to a very few, who, in other respects, were as wretched philosophers as the worst among them, their notions on this head are not</page><page sequence="16">n8 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN lain dormant for many centuries x ? so Nares believes ? the idea was revived with new force and new meaning by the impact of modern as? tronomy. He finds the conception at least implied in Kepler's Som- nium, which he mentions several times.2 He sees clearly, as historians of our own day are coming to see, that the post-telescopic conception of a plurality of worlds differed in many significant features from the logical presuppositions which are found before 1610.3 The sudden emergence of the idea into general popularity he attributes, correctly enough, to the fact that "it was made the subject of wit and gallantry by Fontenelle" 4 who "drew the attention not only of the learned and philosophical, but of all the inquisitive and curious of both sexes." s Fontenelle made the idea a fad of the moment; it remained, Nares believes, for Christian Huygens 6 to develop it into a philosophical theory, and to point out "that the Copernican System leads to the doctrine of a plurality of worlds." 7 From the time of Huygens, Nares feels, the doctrine has been seri- worth repeating." Among such philosophers, he includes (p. 81 n.) Diogenes and Plutarch. He pays passing tribute, in his brief survey of the later period (p. 90), to Cardinal Cusanus and to Bruno, but seems not to have read either in detail. 1 The persistence of the theme during this period is treated in a forthcoming work by Mr. Grant McColley. 2 See particularly p. 85 n. Nares's comments upon the Somnium are another indication of the great influence, upon the imagination of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of that work, which has been almost neglected by modern historians of science. 3 I have suggested this idea in the articles referred to above, and develop it in more detail in a later paper on "Voyages to the Moon." 4 Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes (Paris, 1686). The work was immensely popular; the fourth French edition appeared in 1698; English translations by Aphra Behn and John Glanvill were published in 1688, and both went through several editions; a translation by W. Gardiner was republished at least five times; and there were various other English trans? lations during the eighteenth century. s *EI2 BEOS, p. 82. 6 C. Hugenii K02M0BE0P02, sive de Terris coelestibus, earumque ornatu, conjecturae (1698; editio altera, 1699). The work was translated into English, by Huygens' brother Con- stantine, as The Celestial Worlds Discover d: or Conjectures concerning the Inhabitants, Plants and Productions of the Worlds in the Planets (London, 1698); another edition (the one to which Nares refers) bore the title, Cosmotheoros: or conjectures concerning the Planetary Worlds (Glasgow, 1757). 7 *EIS BEOS, p. 83. Nares gives an analysis of Huygens* work, pp. 90 ff. He adds, in a note to the passage above: "Lord Bolingbroke is not content to say, the Copernican System leads to the notion of a plurality of worlds; he says, it constrains us to suppose other inhabited globes like our own."</page><page sequence="17">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 119 ously considered and frequently accepted by many of the most thoughtful and learned men, as the inevitable outcome, first of the Copernican, then of the Newtonian, cosmic scheme; in his own life? time, the great discoveries of Herschel had given it still more profound significance. There is no question of Nares's own acceptance of the theory. He justifies it upon scientific and philosophical, as well as historical, grounds. Nares's is a universe of infinite space, of multitu? dinous worlds; more, "our glasses seem to detect new ones every day." x He finds in Herschel's discoveries, as reported to the Royal Society, new evidence that in the crowded heavens are planet on planet, world on world, "connected together in one great System of mutual support." He goes back not only to the philosophers but to the poets, for evidence of the stimulus which this belief has given to imagination.2 And why, he asks, should he not, as an orthodox theo? logian, believe in a plurality of worlds ? He sees nothing in his theology to contradict the idea which he feels has vastly expanded human im? agination, that "not only this pitiful globe of our's;?-but all the plurality of worlds, and variety of beings, that infinite space can con? tain" 3 bespeak the greatness of their Creator. Nares's is the deity of the "new science," expressing himself everywhere and eternally in all possible varieties of life; his "best of all possible worlds," which follows closely the eighteenth-century theodicies from which it is obviously drawn, is that in which all possible aspects of existence are to be found. It is a universe that man had derived from telescopic and microscopic observation, as well as from the Platonic con? ception of a plenum formarurn, infinitely full and, because of fulness, coherent.4 From that conception of a deity expressing himself eter- 1 Ibid., p. 67. 2 Nares refers frequently to Addison, Pope, and Blair; but his chief references are to Young. It is interesting to see, in the works of Paine's disciples, the great effect of the Night Thoughts, particularly of the "Ninth Night." 3 'EIS BEOS, p. 27. 4 The philosophical backgrounds of these ideas, particularly the Platonic concep? tion of Nature as a plenum formarum, with the "principle of plenitude" derived from it (which became of such great importance in eighteenth-century thinking), have been studied by Professor Lovejoy in the articles referred to above, and are further developed in The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea (Cambridge, 1936). In the group of articles to which I have already referred, I have stressed, rather, the scientific preconcep? tions which supplemented these philosophical ideas.</page><page sequence="18">120 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN nally in creation of all possible forms of life, Nares reaches his justifi? cation of the idea of the mediation of Christ. The deists, he suggests ? and his point is well taken ? have allowed themselves to be so overwhelmed by the scientific conceptions of a vastly expanded cosmic order and of an infinitely full universe, in their finding that man is only one of the many links in the great chain of being, that they have tended to disparage too much the importance both of man and of the little world in which he dwells; reaction from the earlier glorification of man and of the globe which he inherits, has, Nares feels, gone too far. "The Deist can admire and acknowledge the hand of God in the wings of an ephemeron," says Nares acutely, "though he thinks our poor earth too paltry for the Son of God to visit!" * Minute and infinitesimal our earth has become, Nares acknowledges readily; it is only one of several known planets, and by no means the greatest of them; and our known planetary system is only one small part of the great cosmic creation. Man is, truly, but one of the innumerable species of existence created by God. As man surveys the vastly ex? panded chain of being, Then in the scale of reas'ning life 'tis plain There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man. Yet, Nares insists, this realization that man is only one of the links in the chain has carried the deists to extremes. Man does differ from other animals; if he is but a reed, the weakest in nature, he is neverthe? less a thinking reed; like all other parts of the creation, "the firma? ment, in which are worlds innumerable; the worlds, in which are be? ings innumerable: all of them, as things madey distinguished from the Makerp by different deficiencies and imperfections," 2 he shares the im? perfections of his species; but he is also unique among these imperfect creations, for he alone is one of the "parts endowed with such faculties of sense and feeling, as to be capable of tasting felicity, of compre? hending in time the ways of his providence, and of testifying a regard for their Maker." 3 If this, then, is the unique function of "rational" animals, why should we believe that such "testifying," such "compre? hending," is limited to one group of rational beings upon our globe alone? "We know not, but that the other worlds, if such there are, Op. cit., p. 14. 2 Ibid., p. 27. 3 Ibid.</page><page sequence="19">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 121 and they inhabited, must needs be possessed by beings in rationality and intellect resembling ourselves; whatever may be the different degrees of intellect, or whatever outward covering, or form, or 'fleshly tabernacle' may be assigned to their souls in their present state." x How much more consistent with the glory of God it is to consider that everywhere throughout the cosmic order are beings en? dowed with the capacity of tasting felicity, and of joining in the great chorus of praise to their Maker. So the deists themselves affirm. Why should they, then, hesitate to believe that, as the Deity expresses him? self everywhere and eternally in all forms of life, he may eternally be "giving light, in some way inscrutable to us, to every rational creature throughout the mighty firmament?" 2 What inconsistency are we to find in the belief that that "Light" of God, through Christ, has shone upon other races of men, as upon ourselves? Why may it not "be the system of God's providence, with regard to the worlds scattered around by the power of his arm, . . . that his divinity, though neces? sarily one and unalterable, may yet, in its energies and effects, be so far locomotive, as to keep up such a communication with all the works of his hands, as may tend to ameliorate the condition of things, till the grand consummation of all." 3 Is this to limit deity? Nares asks, and he answers his own question: I think I see something, surpassing in glory and greatness itself, all that I can conceive, in the notion of God's sending forth, from his own bosom, a ray of his divinity, to guide the diffident and fearful soul, though it have to pass to the utmost bounds of the creation, to find our remote ahiding [i.e., abiding?] place.* ... if Scripture neither asserts, nor should seem to imply this doctrine, still, if our philosophical contemplations and researches have excited in us much more exalted ideas of God's greatness and majesty, since the plurality of worlds has appeared to be a physical truth; I do not see, why it should not give us far more enlarged ideas of God's infinite mercy, to represent to ourselves, from the very words of Scripture, that the same mediatorial method of aiding, healing, and removing the infirmities of God's creatures, has been, or will be, extended in its effects to the utmost limits of the Universe: and, when this mighty work of salvation shall be concluded, and all the acts of all the rational beings throughout the Uni- 1 Ibid., pp. 46-47. 3 Ibid., pp. 19-20. 2 Ibid., p. 18. ? j%/., p. 25.</page><page sequence="20">122 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN verse have been brought to account, then the mediatorial functions will cease, and "God be All in A1L["]* Thus, to Nares, there seems no fundamental inconsistency between the idea of a plurality of inhabited worlds, and the idea of redemption of man through the sacrifice of Christ. If in those other worlds, too, sin has entered in ? and Nares believes that, since all created life shares in the "imperfections of the creature," it will be found to have done so ? then the mysterious power of that "ray of divinity," the "light of his heavenly truth," may shine, not only into "one small closet of his spacious house," but into the "many stately rooms" of his mansions. So Nares, product of his scientific age, attempts to reconcile the new authority of astronomy with the old authority of revelation, and reaches his conclusion that" the philosophical notion of a plurality of worlds is consistent. . . with the language of the Holy Scripture," and that, as his Greek title had implied: "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." 2 IV Among the many readers of *EI2 6E02 was Mrs. Hester Lynch Piozzi. Nares's book was published late in the summer of 1801. On December 2 of that year, Mrs. Piozzi, having completed the publica? tion of her two-volume Retrospections, wrote to Dr. Robert Gray: "We shall go to Bath next month." 3 The Piozzis remained at Bath for some months, and while they were there Mrs. Piozzi bought a copy of *EI2 0EO2. In that "vigorous, black manuscript" 4 of which she was justly proud, she inscribed on the flyleaf: "Bought of Bull at Bath 5 March 1802. H. L. Piozzi"; and evidently settled down to read with care a book of the sort that delighted this woman who "had for sixty years constantly and ardently studied the Scriptures, 1 Ibid., pp. 52-53. 3 I Tim. 2:15. 3 Dr. Johnson's Mrs. Thrale.

PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 123 and the works of commentators, in the original languages; and dur? ing her lengthened life conversed with the soundest divines and best scholars of the age." x If any proof were needed for the statement of her early biographer that Mrs. Piozzi "read and wrote Hebrew, Greek and Latin"?a statement which seems for some reason to have been challenged by more recent critics2?her annotations in 'EI2 GEOS would offer that proof, for Mrs. Piozzi not only writes a marginal comment upon a Hebrew word,3 but in another section, in which Nares is discussing alternative interpretations of the first chap? ter of Genesis,4 she, agreeing with him, notes: "I think so too, ? I think 'tis parenthetical," and adds the Hebrew, d^didh i?i. Unfortunately, from our point of view, the long journey which the Piozzis undertook in 1801-2 s prevented Mrs. Piozzi from comments in the "Thraliana," 6 her journal book, upon her reading of Nares. She does, however, mention the book in a letter written from Bath on March 17, 1802, to Dr. Robert Gray, later Bishop of Bristol: I get more conversation here than in London. Our modern Plurality of Worlds is much admired, and justly . . . my worst fear is lest, in these daring days of bold and unauthorized conjecture, some one should start out and go as far below, as Mr. Nares has gone above, the old standard. We might then see printed George Psalmanazar's speculative ideas con? cerning the souls of brutes, and have old Cicero rummaged for quotations. Mr. Piozzi's notion of modern music helps me to illustrate my own meaning. 1 Ibid., p. 9. 2 Hay ward {Autobiography, Letters and Literary Remains of Mrs. Piozzi [London, 1861], I, 43) says that "she could appreciate a classical allusion or quotation, and translate off? hand a Latin epigram into idiomatic English/' Sir Leslie Stephen, in his article in the Dictionary of National Biography, says that she "learned Latin ? apparently not Greek." Her most recent commentator, J. P. R. Lyell (Mrs. Piozzi and Isaac Watts [London, 1934], pp. 14-15), says: "She received a liberal education and acquired a knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish, besides a working acquaintance with Latin." 3 'EIS BEOS, p. 14 n. The comment is given below. 4 Ibid., p. 64. s On September 3,1802, Mrs. Piozzi wrote to the Rev. Daniel Lysons (quoted, Hayward, op. cit., II, 83): "And now we are come home at last after an eight months' absence, and a 500 miles' tour." 6 The "Thraliana," now in the possession of the Huntington Library, are being prepared for publication by Miss Katharine Balderston. There are no entries for the year 1802.</page><page sequence="22">124 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY BULLETIN "Variations are very entertaining/' says he, "but I like a quick return to the subject, which never should be too far forsaken." x Apart from this one letter, her interest in the work can be surmised only from her marginal comments, which are very similar to her re? cently published marginalia upon the Philosophical Essays of Isaac Watts.2 Many of Mrs. Piozzi's observations in 'ELS 6E02 are natu? rally no more important or significant than the notes of most book an- notators, except in so far as they suggest the care with which she read, and give some clue to her own background of general reading. Some? times, for instance, she objects to her author's grammar, as when, Nares having written "their natures, laying in darkness," Mrs. Piozzi changes "laying" to "lieing"3; or when, again, Nares comments upon a book "that lays before me," and Mrs. Piozzi underlines "lays," and notes with asperity: "better begin with the Grammar." 4 In another passage, she suggests a change in phraseology from "on external things'' to "on human things."5 Also, she checks without comment passages which interested her.6 At other times she has indi? cated by a brief comment her appreciation of, or interest in, a particu? lar passage. Thus, a "fanciful conceit" of the Italians that the final dissolution may be compared to "the sound of a clock just before it strikes," brings from Mrs. Piozzi the note: "A very fine Idea in my Mind &amp; very Expressive." 7 A comment of Nares about questions "of more curiosity than use," in connection with "the length of the days of the Hexaemeron,yy leads Mrs. Piozzi to underline "curiosity than use," and add, "so it is all." 8 A question of Nares as to whether it is "of any concern to us, physical or moral, whether the heavenly bodies are intrinsically what our senses represent them," is answered by Mrs. Piozzi, "no truly."9 Another query by Nares, whether the biblical passage on "growing old like a garment" applies to the heavens, with 1 The letter is published in Dr. Johnson's Mrs. Thrale, pp. 288-89.

PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 125 his conclusion that the interpretation of such expressions is often diffi? cult, leads Mrs. Piozzi to comment, "ay truly." x Her longest passage of this sort occurs in connection with a quotation from Locke on the profound difficulty he found in reconciling "freedom in man' with "omniscience and omnipotence in God." 2 The passage is marked by Mrs. Piozzi with a heavy bracket, and the comment: "incomparably said, sweetly express'd: &amp; yet a fault in it ? no Man can be faultless in his expression on the Subject: all Language bends under it;?&amp; that again is as it should be: Language was made for man ? but Knowledge was withheld in mercy." 3 Others of Mrs. Piozzi's marginalia, while still not of general sig? nificance, suggest something of the breadth of her reading. A com? ment on the "musical instrument of the god Pan" leads her to the note: "Pan's 7 Pipes were the 7 Notes of Music." 4 To a quotation from Bishop Sherlock, "By his Spirit He [God] hath garnished THE HEAVENS; his hand hath formed THE CROOKED SERPENT," she queries: "was it not the Zodiack? Path of their favourite Object of Adoration! The Golden Sun\" 5 Again, when an author whom she dislikes, making use of a figure of speech, calls the moon "but a second? ary candlestick, a sconce to reflect the light from the sun," Mrs. Piozzi writes ironically: "well! so says Parkhurst, he calls it a Sconce, &amp; for? gets to say that the wise Son of Sirach calls it so too, in the 42d Chapter of Ecclesiasticus ? where he terms The Sun a marvellous Instrument the Work of the Most High." 6 In connection with certain symbolic interpretations of Irenaeus, she remembers: "The Story of Cupid and Psyche ? The Soul seeking to comprehend her Benefactor, Nature; seduced by doubts of his Divinity, was drawn by Apuleius from these Sources doubtless." 7 Others of the marginalia are of more general interest. Those of one group have to do with the "new science," showing Mrs. Piozzi's inter? est, not only in the problems which Nares raises, but in general scien? tific questions of the day. She knew something, at least, of other IP.35^n. 2 The passage occurs in one of Locke's letters to Molyneux, January 20, 1692/3. Cf.

"Renovation," she writes, "does resemble Creation: ? see the Chemical Process of all fermented Liquors. . . . The stuff when fermented is a new Thing." x She shows interest in the newly emerging science of geology, checking, with the comment "very good," a passage discussing some of the theories of de Luc on fluvial deposits;2 and in a continuation of the same passage, in which Nares considers de Luc's conjectures as to the origin of the earth and con? cludes, "Though we may know what is, we cannot know what has been" Mrs. Piozzi varies the sentence to read: "We cannot know even what is; but we can make [a] better guess at that, than at what has been." In connection with Nares's discussion of other " geological" ex? planations of the present form of our earth, she calls attention to a common confusion in terms, when she says of a "learned writer" who has spoken of the deluge as inundating the universe". " He did not mean the Universe, tho he said so ?He meant our Terraqueous Globe."3 In another place she reminds herself of the development of geography, for in attempting an interpretation of the biblical passage, "all the PEO? PLES of the world," she says: "Recollect that a 4th Continent of ye Earth was then unknown." 4 A passage of Nares, in which he is dis? cussing the "imperceptible corporeal differences" which the develop? ing science of biology had shown among the "beings below us," leads her to the spirited rejoinder: "Brutes must be let alone in this contro? versy ? they are by no means as brutish as wise Men think them; but that is another affair." s The majority of her comments on science have to do with astron? omy, either because of the theme of Nares's book, or because of the en? grossing interest of the age. She had clearly followed the discoveries of Herschel, and had herself observed the moon through a telescope, for, in commenting upon a quotation from Cudworth, who had de? clared that "there could not possibly be a world of rational creatures made by God, either in the moon or in some other planet," she writes: "Herschel's view of ye Moon gives us no great heart of finding it in- 1 p. 223. 3 P. 376 n. 2 P. 119. 4 P. 220. s P. 46 n.</page><page sequence="25">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS.

It seems a wild Place indeed: nearly Chaotic for what I could see of it, and most resembling a large Piece of Gold taken out of a Mine." x She was aware of Herschel's discovery of the planet Uranus, for she notes, in connection with Nares's discussion of "the SEVEN PLANETARY BODIES": "but more than seven Planets have now been seen."2 She had followed, also, some of the more recent observations on the sun. Nares observed: ". . . now we are all fully convinced, that the sun is not a globe of fire, neither the fixed stars"; to this Mrs. Piozzi replied: "I am not yet convinced yet the Maculae seem Proofs of ye new Doctrine." 3 Again, she underlined a quotation from Aristotle that "the sun and the stars are not absolutely bodies of fire," with the comment: "I saw a Book once to say they were Bodies of Ice!"4 Although she does not discuss in any detail the idea of a plurality of worlds, her comments upon some of Nares's passages suggest at least a sympathetic interest in the conception. She stops over his in? sistence that it would be "a very extravagant conceit" to believe that men on this globe must "remain a separate community and uncon? nected with all the rest of the universe," marking the passage, and pondering: "like as the Jews now separated, will be united to the rest of us. will they tho? or will they not." $ With Paine and Nares, she cannot believe that, in the new expanded cosmos, all the vast heavenly bodies were made for the sake of terrestrial man alone; and at one time she corrects a quotation, "'There cannot be any absurdity in saying, that all things were created for the sake of this inferior world, and the inhabitants thereof,'" by the addition: "All sublunary Things were so created I do believe." 6 Her longest and most vehement com? ment upon the new ideas is with regard to this same subject. Nares had been disturbed to find in Parkhurst's Hebrew Lexicon? a work for which he had otherwise great respect, the suggestion that belief in the 1 P. 9i. 2 P. 38711. 3 P. 126 n. 4 P. 125. s p. 2j n. 6 p. ^ n# 7 John Parkhurst, An Hebrew and English Lexicon, without points . . .

Having for a time sought the new heavens with Paine and Nares, having pondered on the stimulus which science had given to human imagination, Mrs. Piozzi is abruptly reminded of the danger of man's considering too curiously. The comment which leads her to re? turn to "sublunary Things," and to reflect rather on the whole duty of man, is a passage in which Nares, feeling that he is perhaps inquiring into the inexplicable, introduces a quotation from Pascal. Nares had paused to reflect: "How momentaneously, by chemical precipitation, may a deposition be made, which mechanically would require a large portion of time" ? against which Mrs. Piozzi noted: "very true and well urged." Consideration of the problem led Nares to say, "Let us 1 P. 14 n. 2 John Hutchinson, author of Moses's Principia (1724) and other works, founded a sect which took its departure from the idea that Newton's doctrines were of dangerous con? sequence to religion. They stimulated a long controversy over the newer geological theories, taking their stand with Burnet and Woodward. They also established a school which held to the printing and reading of Hebrew, "without points," holding that Scripture, thus read, upheld their interpretations. Hutchinson's chief followers were Duncan Forbes, John Park? hurst, Bishop George Home, and William Jones of Nayland, all of whom agreed in a highly symbolic interpretation of Scripture. 3 Thomas Baker, antiquary and correspondent of many of the chief scholars of the day, published anonymously his chief work (to which Mrs. Piozzi here refers), Reflections on Learning (1700), which went through many editions. He, like the Hutchinsonians, was an anti-Copernican and an anti-Newtonian. 4 *EIS 9E02, p. 14 n.

Mrs. Piozzi, remembering, doubtless, that pride of man which is a constant refrain of the eighteenth century, wrote against Nares's "Let us be modest": "That we never are: but this French Quotation is admirable; for as Paschal says every thing in our own Laboratory exceeds our Comprehension, &amp; yet we will keep on trying to comprehend how God made the universe." Then, in a separate paragraph, her feeling overflows: "/, H. L. Piozzi do from my Soul abhor &amp; condemn these Studies; produced from the rotten Fruit of the old Forbidden Tree. We were sent hither (after Adam's Fall &amp; Punishment,) to //// the Earth &amp; not examine it. Our Business is to labour ? we are not properly now Contemplative Beings." x It is the old cry of St. Paul and St. Augustine: "Man by nature, man as he is man, is corrupt and fallen"; it is the persistence of that spirit of "knowledge within bounds," against which Paine revolted and which, he declared, had for centuries kept man from scientific progress; "in Adam's fall we sinned all," and the expiation of our sin, for some rea? son, must consist, not only in earning our bread by the sweat of our brow, but in keeping our eyes upon the ground which we till, and not searching into those "mysteries" of nature, knowledge of which be? longs to God alone. To this theme, and this conception of man's na? ture since the Fall, Mrs. Piozzi returns several times. In response to a quotation from one of Clarke's sermons, "All rational beings whatso? ever, capable of good and evil, of obedience and disobedience, must be created originally in a state of trial and probation" Mrs. Piozzi de? clares: "I don't like must, but yet it certainly does appear as if good &amp; evil were given for Rational Creatures to chuse out of? as we cannot find any thing to exercise ye reasoning Power upon, excepting Good ?s? Evil." 2 The same idea occurs a few pages farther on, in connection with a passage in which Nares raises the question whether man was ever, even in the state of his innocence, "perfect in the sight of God" and inclines to doubt the possibility of absolute perfection in "the creature." Mrs. Piozzi agrees, "very true," and adds: &amp; I am not confident that they were made reasoners till they eat the Fruit which suited them so ill. ? They were made happy Creatures, &amp; 1 Ibid., pp. 117-18.

" The Woman whom thou gavest to be with me," &amp;c.2 Scripture, rather than science, was the ultimate source for Mrs. Piozzi.3 "The Bible," she declares in one of her marginalia, to a pas? sage in which Nares was laboring to make his scientific conceptions consistent with the first chapter of Genesis, "was giv'n to shew us the way to Heav'n, but not to shew us how y* Heav'n was constructed." 4 And a comment of Nares that, "considering all things, it is really a miracle that we are in possession of such documents as those of holy writ," stimulates Mrs. Piozzi to write a signed note: That is the truest Word in this book. When you consider the hebrew Text or rather the original Text of what 1 P. 19 n. 2 Pp. 296-97. 3 Mrs. Piozzi's knowledge of the Bible, as shown both in these marginalia and elsewhere, was broad, her allusions apt. In commenting upon a statement of Nares's (p. 335), "The Apostle . . . comforts the Gentile converts of Ephesus, by assuring them, that they were as much considered in the decrees of God ... as ever the Jews were," Mrs. Piozzi says: "yes, yes; but ye Syrophoenician Woman found herself particularly favour'd for having acknowl? edged that Gentiles were to the true Israelites, but as a Dog is compar'd with a Child in the Eyes of the Head of his Family. Her Belief was right, &amp; saved her Daughter's Life." * P. 104.</page><page sequence="29">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS.

H.L.P.1 Among the many orthodox scriptural ideas which Mrs. Piozzi ac? cepted, that of the final dissolution of all things haunted her mind particularly, as several of her casual references have shown. She paused over a passage of "the learned Mr. King," who was "exceedingly un? willing to believe, that the stars shall come to an end at what we call the end of the world," underlined the phrase, "unwilling to believe," and added thoughtfully, "so am I?&amp; yet!!!"2 Nares, while he never doubted the ultimate dissolution of this world, felt that the final cataclysm could not and would not extend to the vast plurality of worlds. Mrs. Piozzi's last note but one has to do with the theme of a plurality of worlds, though of a different sort from that Nares con? ceived. This note takes its origin from a passage of the kind of sym? bolism in which both Nares and the Hutchinsonians delighted, an ex? cursus upon the "mystic number Seven"z? its significance as seen in the seven churches, the seven candlesticks, the seven spirits, and else? where.4 On a separate sheet of paper, which she inserted between two pages,5 Mrs. Piozzi wrote: I shd. rather (when dreaming) dream y* that [sic] they were typical of the seven relative Po? sitions of our own Globe as class'd into The Theological Astronomical Political Moral Natural.

At the conclusion of his volume, Nares, considering that universal problem, had written: "But, when the end of all things shall not only be at hand, but shall have begun to take effect, the events will be decisive: we shall no longer have to learn how to act under them; all will depend on the preparation we may before have made to meet them." Against this passage, Mrs. Piozzi's "vigorous, black manuscript" appears for the last time: "yes, yes, we shall ? or else how does it come like a Thief in the Night? ? tho' expected ? it will come suddenly." x Random and casual as these marginalia are, they are not without significance in assisting the historian of ideas to test a climate of opin? ion. Their author was a woman of more than average education, of broad, if not deep, reading; on the whole, conservative in her theologi? cal opinions, yet with an inquiring mind. These are reflections upon movements in thought which, while directly derived from Nares, and indirectly from Paine, nevertheless are the heritage of a long contro? versy between the "new science" and theology, which Bacon prophe? sied in the Advancement of Learning, and which the course of two cen? turies had developed. One extreme of the reaction is to be seen in Paine and his disciples, who, faced with the clash, threw aside tradi? tional theology and accepted science; the opposite extreme shows it? self in that group of adversaries who ? like the Aristotelians who re? fused to look through Galileo's telescope ? denied the evidence of science, doggedly clinging to revelation. Between the two groups stood men like Nares, who, responding to the imaginative appeal of science, yet reverent toward traditional theology, strove to reconcile science and religion, feeling that science had expanded not only the cosmos but the whole conception of deity, and that an undevout as? tronomer must indeed be mad. 1 P. 4oi.</page><page sequence="31">PAINE, NARES, AND MRS. PIOZZFS MARGINALIA 133 But of all the varying responses to the new conceptions, perhaps those of Mrs. Piozzi are most characteristic of the average man and woman in a period of intellectual conflict. She followed the obvious discoveries of science, as does the intelligent layman in any genera? tion; she was willing to read, to think, to discuss the new ideas; she was interested enough to annotate the volume which she read. Momentarily, her imagination responded to the stimulus of some of the most radical of these ideas; but, the moment past, tradition ? sometimes common sense! ? recalls her to her orthodox training. In the last analysis, interesting as are these new ideas, they are not, the intelligent layman seems to say, of profound importance; or they are theories, well enough to ponder but not ultimately capable of proof. Let us return to a safer, more circumscribed world of the morality and the theology in which we have grown up, remembering comforta? bly that right and wrong have been established by tradition, that there is a place to which we may turn to find that "Good &amp; Evil" upon which men and women like Mrs. Piozzi base their ethics. Mrs. Piozzi's position, indeed, is curiously similar to that of Milton's angel, whose author, momentarily swept away by the vast concepts of the "new astronomy," permitted his angelic visitant ? and his pupil, Man ? to ponder these same ideas of other worlds and other rational inhabi? tants, then abruptly recalled himself and his characters, and his read? ers, to the problem of the world in which man must live, and to the whole duty of man: Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid: Leave them to God above; him serve and fear . . . Heaven is for thee too high To know what passes there. Be lowly wise; Think only what concerns thee and thy being; Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there Live, in what state, condition, or degree . . . .learn That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and subtle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime wisdom.1 1 Paradise Lost, Bk. VIII, 11. 167-94.</page></plain_text>
