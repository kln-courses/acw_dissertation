<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOLOGICAL ENCOUNTER II Responses to Rita Gross Rosemary Ruether Garrett-Evangelical Theology Seminary RUETHER: SinceJohn Cobb responded to Rita Gross' first paper on the Three YanaJourney, I will concentrate more on another paper which she submitted as background: on the feminine principle in Vajrayana Buddhism. The paper deals with meditational practices in Vajrayana Buddhism and focuses on the feminine principles as a key part of the initiation. Gross raises questions about concepts of dividing masculine and feminine and suggests that this division is still rooted in gender stereotyping of male and female roles. She also discusses the visualization of feminine as divinity and the effect of that on the self within a tradition which has basically suppressed all female symbols of deity. She then examines what she calls the triple revolution in God language in the Western orthodox tradition: Jewish, Christian and Islam. The triple revo- lution is one of monotheism, transcendence of nature, and abolition of divine gender, which upholds the concept of the oneness of God-a oneness of God which is, in theory, beyond nature and gender. In actuality, this triple revolution does not really transcend gender, but in fact, it promotes the male gender as symbolic of unity and transcendence. It also suppresses female symbols. Female symbols have become symbolic of that which is non-divine or creaturely. Gross explores the more recent efforts to reclaim feminine sym- bols expressed in yin/yang psychological terms which refer to the androgyny of the self. In her view, the feminine is still symbolized in terms of the unconscious. If the feminine is the unconscious, therefore consciousness is masculine, and hierarchal symbolism still remains preserved. Gross then examines feminist spirituality as exemplified in Wicca move- ments, which she finds unsatisfactory because they tend toward a gynocentric reversal in which the feminine or the goddess becomes the dominant symbol, the symbol of wholeness. The male becomes either an auxiliary or an actual representation of the maimed or the defective-a reversal of Aristotelian anthropology in which the feminine is the defective. What Gross is obviously looking for in Vajrayana Buddhism is some kind of balanced symbolization of the masculine and feminine. She explores that Bxddhist-Christia Studies 7 (1987). ? by the East-West Religions Project, University of Hawaii.

Although space sounds passive, perhaps in the Western tradition, Gross does not see it as such. In this tradition, form emerges out of space and energy emerges out of emptiness. The feminine principles are the mothering or source of the masculine principles. The feminine principle of discriminating wisdom can be viewed as the mother of Buddha activity. It seems that at the end of the article there are still some unanswered ques- tions. Gender labeling of psychic dualities may still create a feminine auxil- iary-feminine nurturing as auxiliary to male activity. In some way, the paper still promotes the idea that women really are better at nurturing and men are better at the activity, even though each may have some capacity for both. Therefore, there should still be some elements of psychic specialization in one or the other. Male monotheism and the suppression of female gender symbols for the divine can be examined in terms of the background of the ancient Near East against which the Hebrew monotheism plays. There is a symbol for the divine as a plurality of deities that seems to represent several kinds of plurali- ties. There is a plurality of the different spheres of nature: water and air, for instance. There is a pluralism of generation: of grandparents, of parents, and of their children. Typically, the younger gods and goddessses are seen as sib- lings of each other. Then there is the plurality of male and female. Both gen- ders are clearly and equally represented. This symbolism of the divine as male and female, as god and goddess, in these Near Eastern traditions, do not fall into what we would call gender-role stereotyping. In other words, the goddesses, contrary to what we are constantly told, are not primarily femi- nine. They don't represent the feminine. The gods are not primarily what we would call masculine principles. There is not a dichotomizing of masculine and feminine principles that are represented by gods and goddesses. Rather, gods and goddesses each represent complex personalities, and each have spheres and natural powers, but each are also very much representative of social power as well. Very typically, the goddesses are quite aggressive and powerful and protect or rescue the male god-sometimes from some other male gods. However, contemporary notions of masculine and feminine really don't apply to ancient gods and goddesses. Language concerning deities predates masculine and feminine role duality, at least on the symbolic level. I agree with Gross that Hebrew montheism ultimately becomes male monotheism. A very useful book on this subject, by Judith Ochshom, is Female Experience and the Nature of the Divine. She compares the ancient Near Eastern myths of gods and goddesses with Hebrew monotheism. Ochshorn also says that although theoretically there is the one god who is beyond gender, in practice, this god becomes identified 118</page><page sequence="3">RESPONSE TO GROSS predominantly as the male gender-making the male gender representative of the divine attributes of unity, of transcendence of nature, and of rational- ity and sovereignty. The female is representative of the non-divine or the creaturely. This is how the female is represented in Judaism, and it is carried over to Christianity with input from the Greek dualistic tradition. The female is represented as the creaturely in two different senses. First, the female is representative of the creaturely in regard to those characteristics which alienate us from the divine: sexuality, bodily impurity, and disobedi- ence. (Although males have bodily impurity in theJewish tradition, women have it almost by definition.) Idolatry is always symbolized as harlotry and refers to the female. Eve, Jezebel and the whore of Babylon are the female symbols for those negative qualities that alienate us from God. There is also what might be called a positive femininity or a positive sym- bolism of the creature. Here, the feminine becomes the creaturely in the sense of a creaturely openness to grace, obedience, being open to being filled with divine grace. Divine grace as masculine is symbolized in terms of Israel as a whole, with the community as the bride of Yahweh. This idea is carried on in the Church: mother church as the bride of Christ. Mariology picks up on this positive femininity as the creaturely openness to God. In male mono- theism, the female gets to be the symbol of the creaturely in either the nega- tive or the redemptive sense. The feminine is not a part of God. Alternative traditions in Jewish wisdom, in mystical traditions, and in Christian heterodoxy indicate that there are alternative possibilities where the feminine principle is indeed seen as part of the divine. One of the ways in which the feminine principle is seen as a part of the divine is the wisdom tradition, where the ultimately transcendent is thought of as masculine. The feminine principle of wisdom, a feminine aspect of God, is seen as coming forth from the transcendence of God. Wisdom repre- sents the mediation of God; the immanent principle which is the means through which God creates the world. Wisdom underlies God's providential rule, and it is the revelatory principle and the principle of reconciliation of the soul to God. The soul is seen as masculine, as with Solomon. There is a masculine and feminine which symbolizes the transcendent and the imma- nent aspects of God. This idea is developed further in Jewish mysticism where again, the transcendence of God is masculine and the immanence of God is feminine. These two sides of God are seen as having becoming aliena- ted by sin. God's masculine side, the transcendent side, has become split or alienated from the feminine or immanent side. The immanent side of God is seen as going with Israel into exile, being that presence of God which is still there, even in exile. The masculine side of God is seen as having become silent and absent. Therefore, redemption can be symbolized as the reunifica- tion of the masculine and feminine sides of God-symbolized as a sexual union on the Sabbath. Much less known are some of the traditions of Syriac Christianity, in which 119</page><page sequence="4">ROSEMARY RUETHER there is an exploration of the feminine Holy Spirit. This feminine Holy Spirit is referred to as a maternal power within God that bursts forth from God. At one point, the Holy Spirit is referred to as the milk that comes from the breasts of God. This maternal power of God is then connected with the power of rebirth in the waters of baptism. There is a strong correlation between the maternal power of the Holy Spirit and the baptismal font as a symbol of rebirth. Gnosticism has a wealth of androgynous symbols for God. In Valentinian pleromic symbolism, there are a whole series of diadic unities which resemble those in Buddhism. These series of diadic unities start out with death and silence and then move on to symbols such as truth and life, humanity and church. These diadic unities unfold one out of the other until there is a whole pleromic spiritual universe. The fall of the spiritual universe is seen as coming about through the Sophia-the female eon who is the low eon on the totem pole, so to speak. She is seen as a kind of cosmic Eve who causes the fall of the spiritual universe. Yet, the fallen or demonic powers who erupt out of this fall and who create a negative universe are typically symbolized as demonic male powers. In gnosticism, in the text called the Trimorphic Protonoia, the female principle is seen as the redemptive power through which the fallen cosmos is to be redeemed and which will overthrow the present demonic reigning male powers. There is a section in the Trimorphic Protonoia where these male powers realize that their doom is near, and they are all trembling with fear. They go to the highest male archon and complain that they are about to be overthrown. It is quite explicit that it is this higher female principle which will overthrow these demonic male powers and integrate the spiritual uni- verse back into its original heavenly form. The medieval Christian mysticism ofJulian of Norwich refers to the moth- ering Christ. It draws on the notion of Christ as a mothering figure who nur- tures us with milk. Again, the rebirth symbolism of Christian baptism becomes a source full of possibilities for thinking of a maternal principle in Christ. Protestant Sectarianism adopted this side of the Medieval tradition and perpetuated it in mystical and millennarian sectarian groups who drew inspiration from figures like Jakob Boehme and Swedenborg. Probably, the most developed theology in this respect comes from the Shakers, who have a fully developed notion of an androgynous God and christology. In the Shaker trinity, there is a father and a mother God who are co-equal. One is not dominant over the other. The mother is associated with wisdom. This androgynous god is the source of the human pair, male and female, who are seen as being in the image of God precisely as God is male and female. This must then produce a redemptive or Christological pair. There must be a female Christ to represent the female side of God. In Shaker thought, redemption is incomplete until the female Christ appears, completes the redemption of humanity, and gathers humanity into the millennial church. 120</page><page sequence="5">RESPONSE TO GROSS For the Shakers, the female Christ is the second appearance of Christ, which completes the redemption of humanity. Why were these possibilities rejected in orthodox Trinitarianism, and can we or should we be open to them today? Obviously, the trinitarian symbol- ism that emerged was masculine and something that's not quite gender iden- tified, called spirit. But certainly it is not anything that very explicitly has a male and female side. The rejection of these possibilities comes from two kinds of concerns. One concern is this tremendous hostility to a female element in the divine which had been a part of patriarchal God language. In other words, the female had become so profoundly identified with the creaturely and, therefore, precisely with what is not the divine. That identification becomes a very key element in the exclusion of any possibility of female symbolism in God. Secondly, there is a concern for the unity of God. That early orthodox Trinitarian devel- opment was very concerned that the threeness of God-the three hypostases -be co-equal and not some kind of descending hierarchy. In conventional patriarchal thought, males and females cannot be co-equals. Only males can be co-equals. It is stated very explicitly in ancient friendship theory that men and women cannot be friends because they are not co-equals. Friendship is possible only between male and male. If you are going to have co-equal prin- ciples, they end up being male-male principles because a male-female rela- tionship would be inherently hierarchal. Both of those elements are at work in expelling female principles from God language. Yet, Christianity wanted to do more with the Trinity than just have a triadic cloning of the male god, which would be basically static. In other words, part of the point of Trinitar- ian thought was precisely that the Trinity symbolized more than just a tran- scendent other. The Trinity really symbolized a new concept of God that was very difficult for people to grasp who were part of ancient Greco-Roman phi- losophy. There was incorporated into the very nature of God some kind of a dynamic or dialectical movement: the movement of God entering into his- tory and then incorporating history into the nature of God. This is really what can be symbolized by the notion of God as Trinity rather than simply by God as 'one'. The notion of Trinity as a symbol of dialectical movement has been expressed in two different ways. It has been expressed on the psychological level by making the Trinity a symbol of a dialectic of the self. St. Augustine's treatise on the Trinity made the Trinity symbolize a dialectic between the being of the self and its self-consciousness. The Spirit is the unitive principle that connects the two. And McQuarrie suggests something of that when he talks about the Trinity as a symbol of Primordial Being and Expressive Being which, in his terms, "lets being be." The Spirit is the unitive principle which brings 'manyness' back into the community. Hegel and, even more, Process Theology have used the Trinity in building what classical theology called the Economic Trinity. The Trinity is symbolic of 121</page><page sequence="6">ROSEMARY RUETHER the whole historical process of creation and redemption. But they are more able to see explicitly that the Trinity now really means that God's being enters into becoming and that God's becoming really does become. They overcome the notion of God as an immutable being, irrevocably separated from mutable beings. God's being entering into creation means that God's being enters into becoming, and indeed, then becomes. History gathers that becoming into some consequent being as Process Theology refers to it. It seems that this whole differentiation of one pole of psychic and spiritual capacities as masculine and another pole as feminine, whether that be inJew- ish mysticism or in Christian thought, and perhaps also in Buddhism, is fun- damentally shaped by a heritage of gender role specialization in societies. In other words, the tasks of governing and higher culture are assigned to men; therefore, rationality is referred to as masculine. Relationality is referred to as feminine. That pattern of thought ultimately derives from social role segre- gation and specialization. The labeling of certain qualities as masculine and certain qualities as femi- nine carries with it a heritage of power inequality. It is not accidental that it is always the feminine which is in some way auxiliary or relational to the mascu- line as activity. It is suggested that males really have more capacity for the masculine, and women have more capacity for the feminine. Therefore, women should do more of the feminine, and men should do more of the masculine. There is still an imbalance in human development as long as the labeling of those psychic capacities as masculine and feminine continue. We need to recognize that there is dialectical polarity in the self, but this dialectical polarity needs to be symbolized as co-equal principles that interact in mutually creative synthesis. It is necessary to stop labeling them in terms of gender dualism. The psycho-biological basis for this kind of dialectical capacity in the self is essentially brain development in terms of right-brain and left-brain. As we all know, we have a whole brain. It is not the case that men have a left brain and women have a right brain. However, this kind of brain differentiation allows for a great deal of social development in encour- aging people to specialize in one capacity or the other. But it is not the case that there is a difference of capacity. We have both the capacity in our psy- cho-biological structure for unbalanced development as well as for balanced development. We need to represent each person, both male and female, as capable of full and balanced integration of these diadic unities. In order to do that, it would be better to label them descriptively. There might be other symbols that don't carry the heritage of dominant and auxiliary references. We need to interject into our symbolism for God some kind of masculine and feminine duality. Rather than trying to find one of the members of the Trinity, presumably the low spirit on the totem pole as the candidate for the feminine, we need to more radically affirm the basic insight of the Hebrew tradition. The basic insight is that God is indeed One in being beyond gen- der, which means that God as a whole, and not God as differentiated into 122</page><page sequence="7">RESPONSE TO GROSS parts, must be symbolizable in metaphors and parables drawn from both female personifications and male personifications. God being beyond gender and being One needs to be symbolized in terms of male personification and female personification. These personifications do not represent parts of God but are equal representations, symbolizations of the whole of God. In other words, it is not enough to have a stern father and a loving mother heaven. It is not enough to make the male symbolize the transcendent and the female symbolize the immanent. This kind of patterning carries this heritage of the inability to have only the female or only the male symbolize the wholeness of divinity. But we still don't have a symbol for the wholeness of a human being. Such a symbol exists in the gospel parables, where there are parallel ways of symbolizing God or God's action in history and Christ in terms of males and females who are not parents. They are not mothers or fathers, and one is not auxiliary to the other. The same activity of God seeking can be symbol- ized as the shepherd seeking the long-lost sheep or the old woman seeking the lost coin. The same activity of God can be symbolized as the farmer sow- ing seed or the women sowing leaven in a measure of flower. These are sim- ply parallel figures. They are drawn from the life's work of men and women and therefore symbolize not God's activity as creator but God's activity as the redeemer, the rescuer, and the transformer of history. GROSS: This kind of spiritual transformation can be called the transformation of ultimate reality. The first topic I wish to address is the topic of languages. We need a plural- ity of languages in our dialogue in order to include mythic; symbolic, or imagistic language as well as the very philosophical language that we all use. Both Buddhism and Christianity have very richly developed symbolic, mythic, or imagistic systems which are important ways of communicating. The kind of images that we've been discussing work to communicate in ways that supplement and compliment the philosophical style of language. Also, the styles of language that come out of a contemplative and spiritual disci- pline are also very helpful. Philosophical language may clarify and liberate us from crude literalism, but mythic language is more communicative in certain ways. Mythic language can heal and inspire and empower in a way that is not true of philosophical language. The two types of language work very well together. Mythic language is very sophisticated and subtle. There has been a tradi- tion in some segments of religious studies or philosophy of religion to regard anthropomorphism as language that is necessary for the people who are not unlearned or sophisticated enough to understand anything else. This idea is incorrect. We could study icons as texts because icons are images. Symbols are equally a part of the tradition. They should not be rated below written and philosophical texts as resources. My study of Hinduism has been vital in con- vincing me of that. Also, it is impossible for philosophical language alone to 123</page><page sequence="8">ROSEMARY RUETHER correct the problems of male monotheism. We can't correct male monothe- ism by moving to a neuter because to do so suggests that people are still very uncomfortable with calling that empowering whatever-it-is "She." They want to be able to say "Parent" because that term isn't as disturbing. The term "mother" is too obvious and too powerful. We should reimage. We should talk in a very sophisticated way about the things we want to reimage, how we want to reimage, and how different alternatives in reimaging would work. I've been concerned about god language and this reimaging problem for many years. The work I did that culminated in "Steps toward Feminine Imagery of Deity inJewish Theology" is in continuity with the article "Femi- nine Principle and Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism." I wrote one of the articles usingJewish language and out of aJewish framework. I wrote the other arti- cle as a Buddhist, trying to rely on traditional Buddhist materials. The differ- ence between these two is the transmission into an authentic lineage of prac- tice connected with the feminine principle that I have received as a Buddhist and that was not available to me in the Judeo-Christian context. Transmis- sion into a spiritual tradition, a living lineage, is the "missing link" in all of my work on Hindu goddesses and on female god language inJudaism. However, I cannot write an article that says, "This is what I've been taught. Here it is folks. Why don't you take it on?" All I can do is to suggest that there is really something there that is worth finding out about. There is a certain amount that we can talk about. "Deity" in Tibetan Buddhism, which is a topic that most people in theol- ogy and even many people in Buddhist studies are probably unfamiliar with, can be found only in the third yana of Vajrayina Buddhism. Much of the material regarding this topic is part of the oral tradition rather than the writ- ten tradition. The term "deity" is the translated term "yiddim." "Deity" seems to be an anthropomorphic representation of enlightenment, which seems to be a pure form of both self and other. If you introduce a deity, peo- ple think this is a being among beings. There's a story, which may not be true, about a practitioner in our sangha who's done all the mumbo-jumbo of a hundred thousand this's and that's who still gets up in the morning and asks Vajrayagini what she should wear to the office. People get confused about this language. So it is really a question of introducing the right lan- guage at the right time. Despite the seeming paradox of a non-theistic deity, working with a deity as a projection which reveals or directs our tendencies is much more profound than regarding a deity as a transcendent other. When I became a Buddhist, I did not agonize over the belief in God which is so difficult for many pre- Buddhists. Instead, I acknowledged that I had never been much of a theist. I was relieved to stop referring to God as an external reference point. God language is an imagistic language. The anthropomorphic image is incredibly powerful when it is used under the guidance of a teacher. Seeing 124</page><page sequence="9">RESPONSE TO GROSS the world and myself as Vajrayagini in practice sessions enables me to see the magic, vividness, or inherent sacredness of the phenomenal world much more readily in post-meditation practice. Finally, there is the issue of the masculine principle. The active real vivid presence of positive feminine imageries has allowed me an appreciation and curiosity about masculine principles and masculine imagery that was not pos- sible when I was stuck in the liturgy of male monotheism. The language and liturgy regarding a masculine design is much more balanced with the pres- ence of real feminine imagery. I don't change the liturgies anymore, and I can now go through a liturgy that talks about the Buddha and his sons with- out wincing. If there were only liturgies about Buddha and his sons, I'd be very uncomfortable. CHAPPELL: I've prayed occasionally to Kannon, who in India is called Avalo- kitesvara and is male, but who is called Kuan-yin in China, where I am more familiar, and appears in female form. Kuan-yin is supportive and nurturing, not strong. On a few occasions, I've prayed to Parvati, who is a strong Hindu female representation. She is very powerful and frightening: bare-breasted, beautiful, self-possessed. She is nothing like the Virgin Mary-as pristine and pure and virginal. Parvati is strong and perhaps frightening for a male, but enormously attractive. She unleashes all sorts of emotions. It is at the same time 'scary' to experience and yet very transformative. Perhaps because I'm an ordained United Church of Canada minister, I have not in my past prayed to the Virgin Mary. I wish to ask those who have done Hail Marys in their past, what that has meant. And I also want to ask those of you who are in the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition who have used female imagery, what that has meant. RUETHER: I think Mariology and Catholicism have been very much shaped by a male spirituality that makes Mary a sublimated feminine for celibate males who want a mother devoid of sexuality: a virginal figure. It is very repressive for females. The basic message for females is essentially to get down on your knees and perform service to male power. I know this from nuns whose whole spirituality was shaped by this orthodox mariology. The name Mary has pri- marily been a symbol of repression for them. There is an interest among those women in reclaiming a more powerful Mary behind this suppressed Mary. But they are very clear that the mariology they received was suppressive and was intended to be suppressive. There is also a popular mariology that functions differently than that. Mary is a much more earthy, pragmatic character who is likely to be more on the side of the little folks than the distant conquistadors. That is the kind of Mary that you get in the Virgin of Guadalupe who is identified with the worker's strike and the Hispanic people, when Christ and God become essen- tially identified with the European conquerors. There is some counterpart in popular Italian Mariology where Mary is an accessible figure who is much more likely to be on the side of both men and women, of the marginalized 125</page><page sequence="10">ROSEMARY RUETHER people; whereas Christ and God are identified with the priest and the police and the government. There is a lot of ambivalence and quite a lot of differ- ent possibilities in Mariology. COOK: I remember my own conversations with some ex-Catholic friends who refer to it as Mariolotry rather than Mariology. I have heard about the per- haps already accomplished elevation of Mary to the rank of co-redemptress of heaven. I think that is grand language. If that has happened or is about to happen, that's certainly not stereotypical. I mean, when we talk about co- redemptress as I understand it, I assume that means she stands beside Jesus and the two of them are equal partners in the process of redemption. TRACY: The issue was discussed in 1955, and nothing further was done to my knowledge. The recognition of the power of the first part of what Rosemary Ruether said has really struck most of us in a way that has made Mariology suspect. I actually don't know anyone who writes or who reads in Mariology -where all these discussions of co-redemptress would be found. It reached its zenith in 1950 with the doctrine of the Assumption. The only one I know who thought that was a really terrific idea wasJung. He said it was one of the greatest things of the 20th century, after which I didn't like him. RUETHER: The official Mariology is really a tool of male clericalism. It essen- tially represents the male clerical power over female embodiment. So in fact, it becomes ai exultation of the power of the Church as females ruled by males. It does not at all become a genuine symbol of female autonomy. It's not really a language of co-redemptress. It's a trickle-down power that comes from the Father, through Christ, and then is expressed through a female with the male in control. RAY: As you know, an important part of Vajrayana practice is visualizing one- self as a buddha. Sometimes these buddhas are male and sometimes they are female. It might be useful to consider what it is like for a man to visualize himself as a female Buddha. This idea may be quite shocking for Westerners. It certainly can be for practitioners themselves. However, it shows in a very direct, practical, and down-to-earth way how a tradition such as Vajrayana works with the image of the woman and with male attitudes to women. For the Vajrayana, what we in the modern world call "male chauvinism" is fun- damentally a personal and a spiritual problem. What is it like as a man to visualize oneself as a woman? It's a bit startling. You develop appreciation for the kind of energy that you normally associate with women, that you find in women. It's a softness and gentleness that one, as a man, does not normally associate with oneself. You disband your notion of yourself as a man. Then what arises is something that is very different. All of the passion that one has for the opposite sex is engaged at that point in that kind of context and with that particular quality. One understands cer- tain discrepancies between habitual patterns towards women that one has learned which contain all kinds of things: resentment, grasping, and so on. One learns some kind of appreciation for what one is in and of him or her- 126</page><page sequence="11">RESPONSE TO GROSS self. Part of the Vajrayana path is realizing that one's own attitudes are really inappropriate. Women in and of themselves manifest something that is very sacred and very fundamental. Part of the practice is just simply trying to con- nect with that. KAUFMAN: We've been using the word "deity" here in a Buddhist context, but what is going on is much more a kind of personification of one's ego ideal-a way of visualizing one's self in a certain personification. That is a very different kind of thing from what most Christians would understand by "deity." It seems that most Christians would regard it as the apex of sin to visualize oneself as a deity. So this issue is a question of whether we're using the word "deity" in any kind of univocal sense at all or even in an analogical sense. Rather, we're using it in highly equivocal ways. Schubert Ogden made some good remarks on that point recently when he was working with the notion of "ultimate reality." Ultimate reality is cer- tainly not my own being, even my own being in its highest or most perfected form. It is that which in some way grounds my being but is also distinct from my being. The otherness of God is a central component in all the religious traditions that make much of the notion of God as the Creator and humans as creatures. So it would be a form of idolatry to identify oneself with the cre- ator, though in some of the mystical traditions, this kind of connection is sometimes made. GROSS: That is why it is a secret practice, You could just be doing something egotistical without the proper preparation. Is the Christian God more than an ego ideal? When we talk about male monotheism and the need to reimage God, it seems like we are working with our language. The question could genuinely be reversed and asked to us as well. RUETHER: Obviously, there has always been this interconnection of anthro- pology and theology. Much of our language for God is anthropological lan- guage. God doesn't speak any language. So our language is anthropological. The theological tradition tried to overcome that by reminding people that the language is not literal. What we have done by imaging God only in terms of the male ruling class aspects is, in fact, to take that language literally. In the process, we deprive both women of the image of God and deprive men of the nurturing aspects of their being. I am arguing for a much more plural and holistic imagery that can really lead both men and women to a much fuller humanity through the image of God and, at the same time, recognize that all of these terms are metaphors that point to something that is not sim- ply encompassed by metaphors. God transcends; God is the ground of being and of new being. 127</page></plain_text>
