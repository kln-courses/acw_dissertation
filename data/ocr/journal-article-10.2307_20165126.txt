PROGRAM AND ABSTRACTS WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1939 Wednesday Morning Session. 8:30 A.M. ; Orton Hall 1. Preliminary Business Meeting. Charles T. Vorhies, Chairman. 9:00 A.M. First Section. Plant Ecology. Orton Hall 1. H. C. Hanson, Chairman. 1. Bog Levels. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Murray F. Buell and Helen Foot Buell, North Carolina State College, Raleigh, North Carolina. A series of levels run across a bog semi-annually over a period of years revealed con siderable fluctuations in the bog surface. The extent of this fluctuation in bog level varies from a small but appreciable change (about 4 inches) in mature bog forest to about a foot and a half in the pioneer forest of tamarack. The sedge mat which varied directly with the water surface showed a maximum fluctuation of 2.3 feet. The fluctuations over the deeper parts of the bog are sufficient to effect materially the results of peat profile studies and pos sibly sampling for pollen analysis. 2. Progress of the Ohio Forest Survey. (12 min.) (Lantern.) Oliver D. Diller, Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station, Wooster, Ohio. The Ohio Forest Survey is state-wide in scope, and is organized on the basis of survey units, each consisting of a county. A technical forester is in immediate charge of survey operations in each county, directing the work of ten field assistants and an office crew of five. Aerial photographs play an important part in the preliminary work of the survey. By means of these photographs it is possible to obtain a map of each individual woodland and determine its acreage in advance of field work. Forest cover maps on a scale of one inch to the mile are prepared, indicating the size, shape, and location of all woodlands. Each wood land is given an identification number referring to ownership, acreage, number of plots to be cruised and other pertinent information. From these data it is possible to obtain (l) a forest type map, (2) data on quantity and distribution of standing merchantable timber by species and size classes, (3) density and composition of growing stock, (4) economic returns from woodlands. Work has been in progress for approximately nine months in 15 counties. 3. The Response of the Plum Grown under Hillculture Conditions to Modifications in Cultural Treatment. (15 min.) (Lantern.) J. M. Aikman and H. E. Brewer, Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station and Soil Conservation Service, Research, Ames, Iowa. Commercial plums of five selected varities were planted in 1938 on steep, eroded soil of the Lindley and Clinton types in Southern Iowa. The variation in the response of the plants to seven cultural treatments on contour furrows and to minimum culture without furrowing was greater the second year than was evident the first year. The marked increase in food reserves of the plants in the more favorable treatments at the end of the first season probably accounted for the wide spread in growth behavior during the second season. The quantitative measurements taken to show response to the different cultural treat ments in these tests were survival percentage, height increase, diameter increment, number and total length of permanent branches and root development. Plants grown under mini 26</page><page sequence="3">mum culture (hand cultivation to a radius of IV2 feet) m contour furrows showed slightly greater growth than those grown without furrows. Two furrows above the row of trees in the contour kept cultivated and the chisel plow effect, which increased the rate of water percolation into the third foot of soil, induced favorable growth response in the plants almost equal to clean cultivation which is not practicable because of excessive soil erosion on the steep slopes. 4. Studies in the Establishment of Native Prairie Grasses on Eroded Soils. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Ivan L. Boyd and J. M. Aikman, Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station and Soil Conservation Service, Research, Ames, Iowa. The establishment of native prairie grasses as interplanting cover crops on eroded soil of the Lindley and Clinton types was investigated in 1938 and 1939 by means of replicated seed plots and contour strip seeding at the Hillculture Field Station in southern Iowa. Germination tests of the seed to be planted were made immediately preceding planting in order to determine the correct rate of seeding. The following grasses were included in the test: Agropyron smithii Rydb., Andropogon furcatus Muhl., Andropogon scoparius Michx., Bouteloua curtipendula Michx., Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag., Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm., Elymus canadensis L., Koeloria cristata (L.) Pers., Panicum virgatum L., Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash., Spartina pectinata Link, Sporobolus asper (Michx.) Kunth, Sporobolus heterolepis A. Gray, Stipa comata Trin. and Rupr., Stipa spar tea Trin. Within four months after planting the grasses without nurse crops had attained almost twice the height of those planted with nurse crops. Field germination, survival, establish ment and ground cover data are presented. Results of these experiments indicate that most of the prairie grasses listed may be established on eroded soils and that the time involved in the process may be greatly shortened over that of the natural succession of prairie grasses on these soils. 5. Plant Ecology of Three Northwestern Colorado Lakes and Surrounding Areas. (15 min.) (Lantern.) K. Richard Johnson, Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois. The lakes here considered range in altitude from 6750 to 8900 feet above sea level. All show marked plant zones or circum-areas. Submersed plants occupy large parts of the lakes with Potamoget?n filiform i s the commonest. During the latter part of summer the shallower portions of the lakes are covered with the water smart-weed, Persicaria coccinea. Sedges and willows form definite zones around the shores but are broader at inlet and outlet regions. A chaparral appears to be the climax for the Lake Aldrich area with Quercus gunnisonii, Amelanchier alnifolia, and Symphoricarpos oreophilus the major dominants. The Lake John area is dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata, Artemisia canadensis) and greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus). The coniferous forest of the Little Columbine Lake area consists of Engelmann spruce (Piceae ngelmanni) and lodgepole pine (Pinus murrayana). 6. Successional Trends in the "Balds" of Roan Mountain. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Dalton M. Brown, State Teachers College, Johnson City, Tennessee. Roan Mountain, altitude 6,285 feet, is located along the northern portion of the North Carolina-Tennessee state line. The plant communities represented are (1) beech-maple, (2) spruce-fir, (3) grassy bald, (4) alder bald, and (5) rhododendron bald. The bald communities cover approximately 1,000 acres. A careful study of growth forms of rho dodendron and conifers furnish unquestionable evidence that these grassy balds were once much more extensive than at present, having given way first to shrub and then to forest communities. This succession continues today. The situation on these mountain balds is in harmony with the theory of natural origin rather than that or Indian origin. 7. Root Studies in Secondary Succession Stages on Eroded Soils. ( 12 min.) (Lantern.) Robert M. Warner, Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station and Soil Conservation Service, Research, Ames, Iowa. The quantity of roots in the four upper three-inch layers of soil were determined in the stages of secondary plant succession on Lindley and Clinton soil types in Southern Iowa. The dry weight of roots in the top twelve inches for the early weed stage was 261.7 kg. per acre, 95 per cent of which was in the top three inches. In comparison, blue grass and oak hickory woods had more than six times as much and sumach over eight times. A two-year stand of alfalfa had only 178.5 kg. of roots per acre in the top twelve inches compared to three times this quantity in the goldenrod-aster-redtop stage of the succession. Percentage of roots below six inches increased significantly in the later stages of the succession. 27</page><page sequence="4">8. Ecology as Applied to Range Research Objectives and Techniques. (12 min.) (Lantern.) R. S. Campbell, Division of Range Research, U. S. Forest Service, Washington, D. C. 9. What is Climax Forest in Central Indiana? A Five-Mile Quadrat Study. (15 min.) (Lantern.) J. E. Potzger and Ray C. Friesner, Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of a ten meter wide strip of forests totalling 5 l/z miles. Climate apparently favors a beech-maple climax in the less favored locations. North facing slopes and moist uplands support beech-maple, while south-facing slopes and sharp ridges support oak-hickory. Intermediate exposures have a less expressed dominance by a few species. The beech-maple type has a better developed small tree layer than the oak hickory type. Viburnum acerifolium is the most common and widely distributed shrub in the region. The four strata are made up of 73 woody species divided as 34 tall trees, 8 small trees, 15 tall shrubs to small trees, 8 small shrubs, 8 lianas. 10. Records of Post-Pleistocene Migration of Forests as Indicated by Pollen from Sedi ments of Deep Lakes. (15 min.) (Lantern.) J. E. Potzger and Ira T. Wilson, Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana. Sediments were taken from Tippecanoe and Winona Lakes in Indiana and from Third Sister Lake near Ann Arbor, Michigan. A new method for collecting lake sediments is described. In a gross way, succession of forests was the same in all three regions. A fir spruce climax was followed by pine, by pine-oak, by oak-hickory climaxes. Oak was dominant at all three locations while the upper two-thirds of the sediments accumulated. Hemlock was a component of the forests, appearing with oak and pine. The pine climax persisted twice as long in the Ann Arbor region than in the Indiana locations. 9:00 A.M. Second Section. Animal Ecology. Orton Hall 105. Charles T. Vorhies, Chairman. 1. Food Habits of Basiliscus basiliscus (Linnaeus), an Iguanid Lizard. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Albert A. Barden, Jr., Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Examination of stomachs of 106 specimens of Basiliscus basiliscus (Linnaeus) from Panama and Costa Rica showed 93% contained food, of which animal matter was 78%, vegetable material 22%. Vegetable material mainly fruit with some leaves and twigs, con stituted the sole food in only one stomach but was found in varying amounts in 50 stomachs. The animal food was 99% invertebrate, 1% vertebrate. The latter included fish, amphibia, reptiles and birds. Of the invertebrates Orthoptera 4.9%, Heteroptera 6.3%, Cole?ptera 20.3%, Lepidoptera 9.4%, Hymenoptera 36.3% and Araneida 5.8% were the most impor tant groups. Ants were present in 69% of the stomachs and comprised 26% of the animal food. Adult forms eaten were 76%, larval forms 24% of the animal food. The food could be classified as 95% terrestrial and 5% aquatic. The wide variety (at least 29 orders of animals) indicates that Basiliscus basiliscus eats virtually all animal food available in its habitat. 2. Social Behavior and Sexual Selection of the Florida Chameleon. (15 min.) (Lantern.) G. K. Noble and B. Greenberg, American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York. Anolis carolinensis, free in a greenhouse, tend to isolate themselves except during the breeding season when estrous females are attracted by the males' courtship movements and dewlap display. Females defend their retreats and, in season, fight among themselves in the male's territory. Dominance of one tends to produce monogamy which seldom becomes complete because of the persistence of residents and newcomers. Out of season, pairs may form when isolated females subordinate themselves to larger males entering their retreats. Male Anolis display three types of head bobs : the courtship, the fight and the subordination gesture. Females exhibit only the latter two. Sex recognition is not dependent upon gestures in these dimorphic lizards, when adult. Experiments show even immature males may be recognized by secondary sexual differences. Normal mating may occur in the experimental loss of the dewlap but males with dewlaps have an advantage when attracting mates from a distance. 28</page><page sequence="5">3. An Application of the Bergmann Zoogeographie Principle. (5 min.) (Lantern.) Orlando Park, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. The nocturnal, carnivorous, forest inhabiting carabid beetle Dicaelus purpuratus, ranges through the deciduous forest formation from northern New York and Michigan to extreme southern Louisiana and peninsular Florida. A series of specimens over this area was measured to obtain specimen square area units. These units were plotted against latitude of collecting locality and the result was a curve of positive correlation between increasing size and increasing proximity to southern limit of the range of the species. These and other ecological data on the species are discussed. 4. Studies in Nocturnal Ecology, IX. Further Analysis of Activity of Panama Rain Forest Animals. (10 min.) (Lantern.) Orlando Park, Albert Barden and Eliot Williams, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. The quantitative and experimental results of a preliminary expedition have been reported (Park, 1938). In the present study vocalization under natural conditions of twenty species resident in the neo-tropical forest of the Panama Canal Zone were quantitatively charted against time, light intensity, air temperature and relative humidity. Nine were nocturnal, nine diurnal and one arhythmic. The species included a typical cross section of insects, frogs, birds and mammals. There was a striking positive correlation between normal species volcalization, local weather and the twenty-four hour cycle of environmental periodic influ ences with a maximum of vocalization at dawn and at dusk. A collateral part of the work was a series of activity records obtained by objective, mechanical, recording equipment on a toad, Bufo marinus and a marsupial, Marmosa isthmica. The data from these two series are discussed with reference to the rain forest community. 5. Factors Affecting Length of Incubation in Birds. (15 min.) (Lantern.) S. Charles Kendeigh, University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois. The rates of oxygen absorption and moisture loss by house wren, Troglodytes aedon, embryos were measured at various stages of incubation and at a wide variety of temperatures. The rate of oxygen absorption and probably the rate of development increase up to 37.8? C. but not to higher temperatures. Moisture and weight losses also increase to a maximum with rise in temperature, this maximum coming at higher temperatures as development progresses. A 24-hour removal of eggs from the nest and exposure to various temperatures has least effect on hatching at 35? and 37.8? C. Considering the greater uniformity of response, high percentage of hatch, the average egg temperature in the nest, and the possible stimulation of fluctuating nest temperatures, 35? C. appears the approximate incubation temperature in this species. Relative humidity in the nest averages about 35%. The length of the incubation period may be determined by the stage of development attained at hatching, the total energy exchanges necessary to reach this stage, and the rate at which these energy exchanges take place. 6. A Comparative Study of Summer Songbird Habitat Groups in Relation to Density of Cover. (10 min.) (Lantern.) William C. Van Deventer, Stephens College, Colum bia, Missouri. A study was made of the habitat relations of small non-game species of birds at the University of Missouri Experimental Area near Ashland, Missouri, in collaboration with the Zoology Department of the University and the Missouri State Conservation Commission. The purpose was to determine the original habitats, within the forest and forest edge, of species of small birds surviving under agricultural conditions, and the equivalence, as regards bird habitability, of man-modified habitats of an agricultural area, and unmodified forest and forest edge. The results seem to indicate that the detached forest-edge habitats of an agri cultural area are approximately equivalent (from the standpoint of bird habitability) to the most open third of the undisturbed forest. This points to the probability that measures of conservation affecting the smaller birds and possibly other forms of wildlife inhabiting open forest may be undertaken in pastures and field borders, without expensive reforestation. 7. The Influence of Topography and Other Factors on Bird Migration. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Stanley C. Ball, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. Geographic relationships raise the Gasp? peninsula to an important position on the passerine, charadrine and anserine flight lines. Gasp? Bay alters the autumn movements of birds that have crossed the St. Lawrence Gulf and River, or that have followed its southern shore eastward. Reaching the southeastern tip of the Forillon all turn back to avoid the Bay, cross three estuaries near its head, and as a rule continue southeastward along its southern shore. 29</page><page sequence="6">Upon the course of their passage around Gasp? Bay minor topographic features exert important influences. The Forrilion's cliffs, ridges, hills and gaps direct the passage of passerine birds, hawks, and others. Wind direction, temperature, incidence of sun-light, and the distribution of vegetation modify the major trends of movement. The St. John estuary, closed by a narrow treeless bar, presents unusual problems to passerine birds. The majority prefer to cross the narrow river five miles inland, than to traverse the bar, only a mile in length. 8. Succession and Convergence of Plant-Animal Communities in the Southern Tundra. (10 min.) (Lantern.) V. E. Shelford, University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois. Seres starting with bare rock, sand, and clay, and the lake and pond habitats, converge in a climax dominated by lichens, principally Cladonia, but including other species and genera. The Cladonias are mixed with heath plants and other woody forms. In the climax, a mat of about 10 centimeters thickness covers the original substratum and is composed of plant debris and the roots and stems of the climax dominants. This succession and con vergence occurs on a very small scale, throwing areas of the various types very close together. The various serai stages do not differ greatly as to kind of cover. This leads to a great many animals' merely showing a slight preference for one stage or another. Wednesday Afternoon. Symposium on the Relation of Ecology to Human Welfare? The Human Situation.

This session will be held in two sections, as shown below: 9:30 A.M. First Section. Joint Session with the Entomological Society of America. Parlors A?B?C, Deshler-Wallick Hotel. R. N. Chapman, Chairman. 1. Environmental Resistance to the Establishment of Imported Parasites. (15 min.) Stanley E. Flanders, Citrus Experiment Station, Riverside, California. 2. Studies of Growth Weights and Food Requirements of Certain Insects. (12 min.) (Lantern.) W. W. Stanley and S. Marcovitch, Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Knoxville, Tennessee. 3. Calculated and Obtained Populations of Microbracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) and Its Host Ephestia kuchniella Zeller (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae) with Reference to Maximum and Minimum Fluctuations. (15 min.) Nellie M. Payne, American Cyanamide Co., Stamford, Connecticut. 4. Relative Prevalence of Potato Flea-Beetle, Epitrix cucumeris Harr., Injuries in Fields Adjoining Uncultivated Areas. (8 min.) (Lantern.) D. O. Wolfenbarger, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, Bloomfield, New Jersey. 5. Autoecology of the Golden-rod Gall Fly. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Lorus J. Milne, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Lynchburg, Virginia. 6. The Dipliyletic Origin of the Nasute Soldier of Termites. (10 min.) (Lantern.) Alfred E. Emerson, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. A study of new phylogenetic characters among the genera of Nasutitermitinae indicate two separate lines of evolution from mandibulate soldiers toward the nasute soldiers. The nasute soldier type seems to represent another case of convergent evolution of defensive adaption. The distribution of the more primitive genera of Nasutitermitinae indicates that the evolution of this group took place in the Neotropical region and that only the more specialized types were able to spread around the world. 7. Quantitative Study of the Recent Emergence of the Periodical Cicada in the Chicago Area. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Eldon J. Strandine, Northwestern University and North Park College, Chicago, Illinois. Three forests were compared with respect to the difference in the soil and the density of Brood XIII if the periodical cicada Magicicada septendecim (Linn.). The pH, organic matter, and the moisture of each quadrat was determined. The number of cicada cases per square meter shows a positive correlation with the number of emergence holes, giving an indication of the density of the population. The number of cases averaged 13 per square meter (51,397 per acre) in the maple forest, 32 per square meter (127,885 per acre) in the black oak forest, and 50 per square meter (202,876 per acre) in the red oak-white oak-maple forest. This periodic change in animal protein is notable in that it increases the food supply in the upper third of the Eltonian Pyramid. This may, to some extent, offset the known detrimental effect of the cicada upon the foliage of important tree constituents. Areas low in soil moisture have few cicada cases. Acid soils have fewer cases than more alkaline soil. Areas which are subject to heavy spring floods are low in cicada cases. Acid soil, excessive soil moisture, or too little soil moisture may act as limiting influences in the local distribution of a brood of cicadas. 8. Inter-specific Competition in Experimental Laboratory Populations. (Presented by Title.) Thomas Park, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. The present investigation is attempting to assay analytically certain aspects of inter specific competition in laboratory populations. The organisms used are cereal or meal beetles: Tribolium confusum, Gnathoceros cornutus and Trogoderma versicolor. These worms can be cultured together as mixed-species populations. At regular intervals counts of laval, pupal and imaginai numbers are taken. The environment is kept as optimal as possible. The populations now running are constituted as follows: Control I, consisting of one species only ; Control II, consisting of two species introduced in initially equal densities, and Experi 31</page><page sequence="8">ment I, consisting of various species' combinations with one form introduced at a numerical advantage over the other. The experiments have been underway for about 500 days but are still far from completion. However, certain tentative conclusions may be advanced: (1) As single species populations, Tribolium, Gnathoceros and Trogoderma give evidence of cyclic flucuations with age; (2) In mixed populations Tribolium appear to drive out Gnathoceros and Trogoderma irrespective of initial densities, and (3) In mixed popula tions Trogoderma and Gnathoceros appear to be about evenly matched; their competition results in no striking advantage for one species over the other. 9. An Ecological Study of the Floor Fauna of the Panama Rain Forest. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Eliot C. Williams, Jr., Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. During the summer of 1938, the author was in residence at the Barro Colorado Island Laboratory. A quantitative study was made of the floor fauna in the rain forest. Eleven quadrats, one meter square, and 18 quadrats, 25 cm. square, were examined. All organisms large enough to be seen were collected. Analysis by the Berlese funnel method was made for most of the quadrats to get the very minute forms. Temperature and moisture were determined for each quadrat and soil samples were taken. These samples have been analyzed. A study of 13 of the 25 cm. quadrats yielded an average number of 12,036.5 organisms per square meter. The main components are as follows: Collembola 27.5 per cent, Acari?a 25.1 per cent, Hymenoptera (Formicidae) 22.2 per cent, Cole?ptera 3.5 per cent, Isopoda 2.8 per cent, and Araneida 1.2 per cent. These orders constituted 82.3 per cent of the total number. There are representatives of 5 phyla and 28 orders in the collection. 9:00 A.M. Second Section. Plant Ecology. Orton Hall 105. C. F. Korstian, Chairman. 1. Buried Viable Seeds in the Forest Floor of a Series of Stands Representing Stages of Succession from Old Field to Climax. (12 min.) (Lantern.) Henry J. Oosting and Mary E. Humphreys, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina. Soil samples from abandoned fields of ten age classes, ranging from fields still under cultivation through Andropogon and pine dominance to oak-hickory climax forest, were placed in flats and exposed to greenhouse conditions. After 37 weeks, when germinations ceased, 5864 seedlings (127 species) had been produced. The highest total germinations were for one-year fields, the greatest number of species for the 5-year fields. The germination data indicate that, under natural conditions, certain seeds may lie buried for long periods and retain their viability and that others are viable for only a short time. Statistical analyses indicate relationships between vegetation and buried seeds, dif ferences between field and forest and between pine and hardwood, and that forest seeds apparently require forest conditions to retain their viability. Viable seeds, present for all age classes, showed a succession of species, in general, correlated with the development of vegetation above ground. 2. Deterioration of Midwestern Ranges. (15 min.) (Lantern.) J. E. Weaver, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska and F. W. Albertson, Fort Hays Kansas State Col lege, Fort Hays, Kansas. An annual survey of grasslands of western Kansas and reconnaissance of a large number of ranges in five neighborihg states show great decrease in basal cover and loss of most mid grasses during the drought. Marked thinning of plant cover or its almost complete destruc tion by drought, overgrazing, and burial by dust have reduced the former basal area of perennial grasses of 60 to 95 per cent usually to 20 per cent or less and often to less than 1 per cent. Overgrazing and "dusting" of ranges with silt originating from cropped and abandoned lands have greatly augmented drought damage. Bared soil is temporarily popu lated, following spring showers, by a host of annuals among which are Salsola pestifer, Lepidium densiflorum and Lappula occidentalis. Most perennial forbs have nearly dis appeared except about 8 most xeric ones which are found thinly distributed throughout. Cactus has greatly increased. Depleted, weedy ranges are scarcely distinguishable from weedy fallow land. 3. Deterioration of Grassland from Stability to Denudation with Decrease in Soil Moisture. (15 min.) (Lantern.) J. E. Weaver, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska and F. W. Albertson, Fort Hays State College, Fort Hays, Kansas. A group of prairies, well spaced from western Iowa through eastern Nebraska to western Kansas, were studied during 1939. The Iowa prairies had water continuously available at all depths; those of eastern Nebraska had a low supply with drought imminent; 32</page><page sequence="9">in central Kansas available water was the exception in the deeper soil ; and in western Kansas water was available only in the upper soil and only two or three times during summer. No decrease in cover or other drought effects were found in Iowa. Cover decreased gradually south westward, finally to almost complete denudation, and current drought injury was increas ingly severe southwestward. Grasses were reduced from 19 species to 9 and then to 4. Forbs decreased from 65 species to 33, and finally to 11 . Height of grasses in Iowa was 14 to 19 inches; it decreased with reduced water content of soil to only 3 in western Kansas. 4. A Preliminary Report on Pollen Studies of Buried Soils of the South Carolina Pied mont. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Stanley A. Cain, University of Tennessee, Collab orator, The U. S. Soil Conservation Service, Knoxville, Tennessee. Deep gulleys in the vicinity of Spartanburg, South Carolina, have eroded into organic horizons which frequently contain abundant peaty materials with well-preserved pollen grains. These deposits are usually a few feet in thickness and may lie under as much as 20 feet of inorganic overburden. The paper presents a report on pollen content of the organic horizons from several stations, and some speculations as to the time and conditions of the deposition. Some data on the problem of species determination of fossil pollens are given. 5. Tree Losses in the Mid-west United States During the Drought of 1933-1939. (10 min.) (Lantern.) F. W. Albertson, Fort Hays Kansas State College, Fort Hays, Kansas and J. E. Weaver, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. A period of exceptionally dry years covering the mid-west United States began in the Spring of 1933 and has continued up to the present time. This extreme drought has affected the whole of the Great Plains Region and has even extended into the more humid region to the East. Tree growth gradually becomes more sparse and more dwarfed from the East to the West in this region. During the drought, many of the trees and smaller woody plants have been completely annihilated. Studies beginning before the drought and extending through it have been carried on by the authors of this report. This survey reached from Iowa to eastern Colorado. Most intensive study, however, centered around Lincoln, Nebraska and Hays, Kansas. In many instances, the trees in hedgerows, windbreaks, farm wood lots, and farm ponds have suffered one hundred per cent loss. In some places, however, where the water table has remained near the surface of the soil, relatively small losses occurred. 6. A Quadrat Study of Prairie and Forest Plantings. Theodore M. Sperry, University Park, Sp-14, Madison, Wisconsin. Plantings of various species of forest trees and prairie plants were made on the Uni versity of Wisconsin Arboretum since 1934. In 1937 a number of "permanent" quadrats, each containing nine square meters, were established. These were remapped in 1939 and it was found that there was a marked development and spread of all prairie grasses planted. An approximately equal development was found among the evergreen plantings but no such corresponding development was noted among the hardwood plantings during the two-year interval. The relative development may of course change over a longer interval of time. All plantings were made in old fields and in all cases except for one prairie planting, the soil was a very poor forest type. 7. Primary and Secondary Succession Studies in the Bass Lake Area, Northern St. Louis County, Minnesota. (15 min.) (Lantern.) John B. Moyle, Minnesota Game and Fish Commission, and Etlar L. Nielsen, University of Arkansas, Fayette, Arkansas. Prior to 1925 Bass Lake stood at an elevation of more than 60 feet higher than its companion body, Low Lake. The two lakes had been separated by a moraine of glacial till laid down in late Pleistocene times. During the period of extensive logging operations a sluice was built to run logs from Bass into Low Lake. Seepage resulted in the formation of minor drainage channels, and in the 1925 melting snows raised the water level sufficiently to instigate surface drainage along the sluice. Tons of glacial materials were removed and redeposited in Low Lake. Areas of the former bottom were exposed by the receding water, the level of which lowered about 60 feet in 10 hours. The succession of plants invading quadrats and transects established in various habitats is being followed. 8. Primary and Secondary Succession Studies in the Sunken Lake Area, Itasca County, Minnesota. ( 12 min.) (Lantern.) Etlar L. Nielsen, University of Arkansas, Fayette, Arkansas and John B. Moyle, Minnesota State Game and Fish Commission. Sunken Lake, formerly known as Bachelor Lake, is located in west central Itasca County, Minnesota. It lies in young gray (middle Wisconsin) drift, and its water level was formerly 33 feet above the present level. The lowering, which took place in a short period of time 33</page><page sequence="10">during the Spring of 1914 or 1915, was caused by the cutting of a roadway through the crest of the ground moraine impounding this body of water. Subsequently, the melting snows raised the level of the lake to such an extent that drainage was begun through the roadway. Considerable areas of former lake bottom, drained muskegs, and gullies were exposed and deltas formed. The invasion of the plants onto quadrats and transects in these situations is being followed. 9. The Biological Field Stations of Europe. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Homer A. Jack, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. One of the first biological field stations of Europe was founded at Concarneau in 1859. Today there are more than 140 field stations in 23 European countries. These are located in such diverse environments as on high mountains, within the Arctic Circle, and on the borders of the ocean, inland seas, and rivers. The stations vary considerably in organization, admin istration, and equipment, and range in size from one-room temporary shelters to the well equipped laboratories at Helgoland, Naples, and Plymouth. Many of these institutions offer facilities for instruction and research in field zoology and field botany, especially during the Easter recess and the summer months. Students and investigators from the United States and other countries are invited to make use of these facilities. Althought present hostilities make it inexpedient for American biologists to go to Europe at this time, when conditions are more favorable they may have an unique oppor tunity to help reconstruct whatever scientific institutions remain. Thursday Afternoon Session, December 28. This session will be held in 2 sections as shown below: 2:00 P.M. First Section. General Ecological Session. Orton Hall 105. A. S. Pearse, Chairman. 1. Reclamation of Wetlands in Southeastern Louisiana. (15 min.) (Lantern.) William T. Penfound, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. The southeastern portion of Louisiana is an extensive wetland area largely unsuited to agriculture. Since a metropolitan city, such as New Orleans, needs a well developed hinter land for agricultural, industrial, and recreational purposes, wide-scale drainage has been resorted to. Unfortunately drainage has not been a success due to overcapitalization, lack of rapid colonization, shrinkage and oxidation of the peaty substratum, ground fires and flood ing. On the other hand valuable lands for migratory waterfowl and fur-bearing animals have been destroyed. Since an important wildlife asset has been ruined without comparable bene fits to the public it is believed that no further drainage or filling should be attempted until additional information is obtained on the biological, engineering, and agricultural aspects of the problem. 2. Concerning the Origin of Sociality in Animals. (20 min.) (Lantern.) W. C. Allee, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. Consideration of the effects of over-crowding greatly influenced Darwin's development of the theory of evolution by natural selection which theory stresses the disoperative phases of competition. More recent studies have demonstrated that under-crowding exists as well as over-crowding. This indicates that there are optimum populations which are intermediate in size. Increase in numbers beyond the optimum results in competition, many of the immedi ate effects of which are anti-social. Increase in numbers from a minimum toward the opti mum has opposite results such as are suggested by the terms "unconscious cooperation" or "automatic mutualism". The existence of optimal populations of intermediate density provide supra-individual istic groupings on which natural selection can act and from which the best developed phases of social living can evolve. Since optimal and infra-optimal populations have been demon strated in all major groups of living animals, it is apparent that the potentialities of sociality are as inherent among these animals as are potentialities of competition. Not all phases of competition are anti-social. Given an underlying stratum of coopera tion, competition, by establishing degrees of dominance and subordination whether in the ecological or human sense, may furnish a basis for more effective community cooperation. These organized communities compete among themselves with resulting survival of the more fit systems. Hence it follows that the groupings of individuals which are sufficiently inte grated so that natural selection can act on them as units supply the crude beginnings from which sociality can develop. 34</page><page sequence="11">3. An Experimental Study of Certain Effects of Temperature on Differential Growth of Pullets. (Read by Title.) W. C. Allee and Catharine Z. Lutherman, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. The temperature at which pullets are reared plays a role in determining certain morpho logical features. Birds left at 6? C. during the third to six months of their age inclusive, were shorter in body length, gained more weight, had shorter tarsi and tails and larger hearts than their former flockmates which were reared throughout at 21 ? to 24.5 ? C. The observa tions on body proportions are in accordance with Bergmann's rule which was based on animals that had grown under natural conditions and has had previous support from experiments on mammals. The effect of environmental temperature on size of heart also corroborates observed climatic effects in nature. 4. The Effect of Aspect of Slope on Climatic Factors. (10 min.) (Lantern.) J. M. Aik man, Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station and Soil Conservation Service, Research, Ames, Iowa. Four weather stations have been maintained during the growing seasons of 1938 and 1939 on north, east, south and west slopes, within a radius of one-fourth mile on the Hill culture Experimental Farm in southern Iowa. The order of the slopes from highest average reading to lowest, for air temperature, soil temperature (1^2 inch depth), wind and evapora tion rate is west, south, east and north. The order is reversed for humidity. The following daily differences between the stations of highest and lowest readings have been obtained several times during the two growing seasons: maximum temperature 6? F., minimum tem perature 8? F., daily average air temperature 5? F., daily average soil temperature (IV2 inch depth) 12? F., daily average humidity 8 per cent, wind velocity 5 miles per hour, evaporation rate 12 c.c. per day. Since these average differences are greater in most instances than is evident in locations separated over 100 miles north to south, they are of sufficient magnitude to indicate that not only geographic location but the degree and aspect of slope within a given location are very important in experimental studies of the adaption of plants to a given site. 5. Atmospheric Moisture in Relation to Ecological Problems. (15 min.) (Lantern.) C. W. Thornthwaite, Soil Conservation Service, Washington, D. C. Current methods of employing atmospheric humidity as a factor in ecological problems are discussed and a new method for measuring evaporation and transpiration directly from natural surfaces is described. The need for a new type of climatic data, namely, evaporation from land surfaces is presented. 6. The Ultraviolet Light Environment of Plants and Animals at and Below the Surface of the Sea. (30 min.) (Moving Pictures.) Hugh H. Darby, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York. In recent years the technique of measuring ultraviolet light both at and below the surface of the sea has undergone great improvement in sensitivity. As a result we now know that much more light of this nature reaches plants and animals under water than had previously been suspected. Close to the surface of the sea, the irradiation of algae like Sargassum is of great significance for animal nutrition, since this alga has been demonstrated to be rich in Vitamin D and thus takes its place as a primary source of vitamin found in fishes. The previously held concept that water cut off the entire supply of ultraviolet light made it necessary to assume that littoral flora and fauna could withstand immense qualitative changes in radiation as the tidal level changed. The new knowledge that some ultraviolet light does penetrate through the water makes that assumption unnecessary and replaces it with a picture of adaption to gradual changes in intensity dependent upon the tide. Methods of measurement will be discussed. 4:00 P.M. Second Section. Orton Hall 1. Joint Meeting of the Committee on the Preservation of Natural Conditions, A. O. Weese, Chairman with the Committee for the Study of Plant and Animal Communities, S. C. Kendeigh, Chairman. BIOLOGISTS' SMOKER Thursday Evening, December 28, 9:30 P.M. Neil House. This year our Society has again contributed toward the sponsoring of this annual, important event with the American Society of Naturalists. 35</page><page sequence="12">FRIDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1939 Friday Morning Session, December 29. This session will be held in two sections as shown below: 9:00 A.M. First Section. Joint Session with Limnological Society of America, Arch eological Auditorium. Paul S. Welch, Chairman. 1. Biological Balance in an Inland Lake. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Chancey Juday, Uni versity of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. 2. Lake Typology, Lake Succession and the Climax Concept. (15 min.) (Lantern.) G. E. Hutchinson, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. 3. The Ecological Significance of Annual Fluctuations in the Marine Plankton. (15 min.) (Lantern.) George L. Clarke, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 4. Effect of Density Currents Upon the Vertical Distribution of Dissolved Oxygen, Tem perature, Silt, and the Existence of a Muliple Thermocline in Norris Reservoir. (20 min.) (Lantern.) A. H. Wiebe, Tennessee Valley Authority, Norris, Tennessee. 5. Studies on the Biota of Reelfoot Lake, Tennessee. 1. The Development of the Aquatic Communities. (15 min.) (Lantern.) W. M. Gersbacher, Southern Illinois State Normal University. 6. Ecological Distribution of Parasites of Twelve Species of Fresh Water Fish. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Ralph V. Bangham, College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio. Data accumulated as a result of the investigation of parasitism of fresh water fish from certain lakes in Algonquin Park, Ontario; eastern Lake Erie; western Lake Erie; Ohio streams ; Buckeye Lake, Ohio ; and from lakes and streams in southern Florida show interest ing results when degree of infection, number of species of parasites and dominant infecting forms are compared for the same species of fish. The fish which were found in all or most of the above areas and whose parasites are to be compared are: bowfin, common sucker, brown bullhead, black bullhead, channel catfish, white bass, yellow perch, blue gill, common sunfish, rock bass, small-mouth bass, and large-mouth black bass. The highest degree of infection was found in the Florida fish where many larval parasites were encountered which had fish-eating birds as their final hosts. Fish from lakes usually showed a higher degree of infection than those from streams. 7. An Experiment on Stream Improvement in Connecticut. (15 min.) George W. Hunter, III, Lyle M. Thorpe, and David E. Grosvenor, Wesleyan University, Middle town, Connecticut, and State Board of Fisheries and Game, Hartford, Connecticut. Stream improvement by means of artificially created pools has become a generally accepted method. An experiment was undertaken in 1937 to determine the value of such a project on one of Connecticut's trout streams. A single continuous stretch of water was divided into three regions, the upper being kept as a control and a "V" dam being built between the lower two. This two-year study shows: (1) Relatively little effect upon the dissolved oxygen, plankton, temperature of water, pH of the region. (2) A deep white pool was created below the dam. (3) This pool carried tagged trout over the winter. (4) The numbers and weights of organisms per square foot of bottom increased markedly in the areas above and below the dam when compared with the control. (5) This increase was most marked in the Trichoptera, Ephemerida and D?ptera?all important in the diet of trout. 8. An Experimental Analysis of the Activity of Viviparus malleatus (Reeve), a Fresh water, Viviparous Snail. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Lynn Hutchinson, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. A series of records obtained from the fresh-water vivaparous snail, Viviparus malleatus (Reeve), in constant darkness and under constant light conditions of 5, 10, 35 and 100 foot candles indicated that this animal possesses an arhythmic activity pattern. However, it was noted than an increase in the number of foot candles resulted in a greater amount of activity over the experimentation period. Furthermore, under normal day-night conditions, a peak 36</page><page sequence="13">of activity, which often extended into the dark hours, was reached by the end of the illumina tion period, and the least amount of activity generally occurred just before the beginning of the illumination period. The results of experiments involving variations in the number of light and dark hours presented further indication that the activity of this species is increased under the influence of light. The activity pattern of this species therefore seems to be a combination of the pattern of those animals described by Park (1935, 1937) as arhythmic, and those described by Park and Keller (1932) as controlled by influences operat ing in the environment. 9:00 A. M. Second Section. Animal Ecology. Orton Hall 1. Orlando Park, Chairman. 1. Lay and Amateur Helpers of an Ecologist. (30 min.) A. H. Wright, Cornell Uni versity, Ithaca, New York. Ecologists need to see diverse environments, forms, workers and their settings. They in their synthetic analytic studies need the help of many people, learned and lay professional and amateur. Ecologists need to be alert, alive, attentive to many disciplines and personal approaches. They need the youthful test of the child's why, the fond sportsman's yearning for the prize or trophy, the amateur's enthusiasm for rare records or specimens. They need to enliven all laboratory science with the irrepressible zeal of the amateur entomologist, the far journeyings of the field ornithologist, the persistent search of the fern or orchid collector. In Dr. W. M. Wheeler's terms they need to enliven some of the "dry rot" or "tommy rot" which passes as science. 2. Annual Fluctuations in Marine Communities of the North Atlantic Ocean. (10 min.) (Lantern.) Ralph W. Dexter, Kent State University, Kent, Ohio. The organisms of marine coastal communities, both intertidal and subtidal, fluctuate greatly from year to year in their abundance. Some of the dominants and most influential species of the marine communities of a tidal inlet at Cape Ann, Massachusetts, were observed to undergo significant changes in abundance from 1933 through 1937 inclusive. No com plete cycle for any species was evident in this space of time, although some of the changes seemed to form a part of a major cycle. Some of the more striking fluctuations were those of Nereis pel?gica (clam worm), Neopanopeus sp. (mud crab), Carcinides maenas (green crab), Littorina rudis (little periwinkle), Thais lapillus (rock snail), Lacuna vi?eta (snail), Mya arenaria (soft shell clam, and Asterias vulgaris (starfish). The causes for several of these changes are known, but most of them cannot be explained with certainty. 3. Observations on the Animal Populations of Marshlands in South Louisiana. (10 min.). (Lantern.) E. S. Hathaway and William T. Penfound, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. In a series of marsh areas, ranging from fresh water to highly saline conditions, observa tions were made on animal populations, with especial reference to insects and fiddler crabs. The distribution of animals was studied in relation to the various plant communities; data were obtained on the salt tolerance of various species; and in some cases variations in size and color in relation to salinity were noted. 4. A Unique Solution of the Range Rodent Problem. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Charles T. Vorhies, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. Thirty miles from Tucson, Arizona, in the midst of a great grazing range presenting the all-too-common picture of burroweed infestation with scant grass cover, lies a half section of private land which is literally a sea of grass. One man alone, with only hand tools, using a unique method of his own devising, has substituted grasses for rodents, ants, and burroweed. 5. Home Range and Population Studies of Some Small Mammals in Southern Michigan. (15 min.) (Lantern.) W. Frank Blair, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. The resident small mammals were trapped alive, marked, and released on about 20 acres of blue-grass association on the Edwin S. George Reserve, Livingston County, Michigan, dur ing the 1938 field season, and on about 13 acres during the 1939 season. Each plot was 37</page><page sequence="14">trapped during alternate weeks. During the two seasons various data were collected on the populations, home ranges, breeding, and movements of the prairie deer-mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii), meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus), jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius hudsonius), and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda tal poides). All four species showed a maximum of breeding activity in the spring and fall, with a slump in mid-summer. The sex ratios of all were about even. The deer-mouse, meadow vole, and short-tailed shrew were considerably more abundant in 1938 than in 1939. The jumping mouse, on the other hand, was most abundant in the latter season. 6. A Method for Determining the Numerical Status and Population Level of Small Mammals in Forested Regions. (10 min.) (Lantern.) W. J. Hamilton, Jr., Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. It is often desirable to know the number of small mammals in unit areas and their relative fluctuations from one year to the next. Plots 100 feet by 100 feet (slightly less than a quarter acre) are selected in extensive areas of similar habitat (preferably 25-200 acres or more.) Three hundred traps are set in suitable places within the quadrat. On a line 10 feet from the outer border of the area 100 additional traps are placel to account for those species leaving or invading the area. Two, preferably three, such quadrats are trapped at the same time. Traps are left set for 3 to 4 days, when a major share of the population may be accounted for. Trapping is conducted in early October of successive years, when populations for the year are usually highest. This method, while not faultless, gives one some impression of abundance or scarcity of a species and indicates roughly the population variations from year to year. 7. Population Studies with Mearas' Cottontail. (12 min.) George O. Hendrickson, Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa. During the period of severe drought and insect epidemics, 1933-'35, cottontails were low in numbers in Iowa. Late in July and early in August, 1939, conttontail population estimates were made in several parts of the state with pellet distribution, roadside count, and walking-time-acre indices developed in recent years. In most unfavorable environments of intensively tilled land of the northern counties estimates 20-40 cottontails to a section were made, and in most favorable environments of partly tilled and partly waste, well-thicketed land of southern counties estimates as high as 800-1000 cottontails a section were obtained. Late in July, 1939, a sick rabbit taken in a central Iowa county and in an area of medium population density was found to show positive lesions of tularemia. Since, tularemia has been found in cottontails in several counties of varying population levels. So far indications are that the disease strikes heavily at various population levels. The data point to a cause for sudden fluctuations in populations of the cottontail for the first time in Iowa, although alternating periods of high and low numbers have been noticed for several decades. Decreases of as much as 90 per cent of the population from tularemia in the past two months on limited areas have been noted, whereas, in neighboring counties and in areas of comparable popula tions there have been no indications of disease or death among the cottontails. Friday Afternoon, December 29, Joint Session with Botanical Society of America. 2:00 P.M. Plant Ecology. Commerce Building, Room 401. E. N. Transeau, Chairman. 1. A Botanical Survey of Bois Blanc Island, Mackinac County, Michigan. Marjorie T. Bingham, Cranbrook Institute of Science, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Bois Blanc Island, situated in Lake Huron, between Michigan's upper and lower penin sulas is within the Lake Forest vegetation zone. Within its seventy square miles are widely varied vegetation types, with transition belts so limited or entirely lacking that one passes abruptly from one plant community to another. Spring, summer and fall expeditions have revealed nineteen distinctly different communities composed of approximately six hundred species of plants. On the Lake Huron shores one finds not only the expected differences of high, middle and low beach but within a few hundred feet the character of the shore is totally altered. Shores of the six inland lakes are unlike the Lake Huron shores. The dominant coniferous forest is entirely replaced in certain sections by pure stands of hardwoods. A few old clearings have assumed the aspect of depauperized meadows, others with more moisture are lush with flowers, many are reverting to forest. Fifty per cent of the island consists of nearly impassable cedar swamp. A small area held in reserve by the United States govern ment has remained primeval forest. 38</page><page sequence="15">2. Salt Marsh Plants in Relation to Tide Levels on the Californian Coast. Ira L. Wig gins, Stanford University, California. An accurate determination of the levels at which Spartina leiantha Benth., Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene, Salicornia pacifica Standley, and Frankenia grandifolia C. and S., grow in eight coastal salt marshes from San Diego to San Francisco Bay shows that these species are confined to definite tidal zones. Spartina grows from about neam sea level to somewhat above mean high water. Salicornia grows from a short distance below mean high water upward. Distichlis and Frankenia grow on the higher levels of the salt marshes, never dropping below the plane of mean high water. Where the tidal regime is low these two plants approach closely the level of mean high water, Distichlis growing 0.10 feet and Frankenia 0.28 feet above mean high water at a station where that level is 4.00 feet above mean lower low water. Where the tidal regime is greater both grow at somewhat higher levels. A study of the curves of tidal charts suggests that the lower limit to which salt marsh plants can grow is determined by their response to the average total time of submergence during the twenty-four hours rather than to direct responses to the depth of flooding. 3. Desert Flora of Northern Peru in an Exceptionally Rainy Year. Harvey E. Stork, Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. The heaviest rainfall that the desert of the Piura Department of Northern Peru had experienced for many years brought out a dense growth of vegetation in 1939. Most of the growth was produced by five species of grasses and ten species of other annuals, seeds of which can remain viable in the sandy soil during long periods of drought. Several perennials depend upon subterranean storage organs to carry them over the dry years and two woody species survive by sending tap roots to an eight meter depth. 4. Distribution of Bright Belt Tobacco Roots in Relation to Soil Profile. L. J. Gier, Campbell College, Buies Creek, North Carolina. During 1937 and 1938, the root systems of over 700 tobacco plants, from two soils each of the Norfolk and Ruston series of Harnett County, North Carolina, were examined. The bulk of the root system for each of these plants was in the plowed A horizon, although many feeding roots extended from the A2. Usually only a single root entered the B horizon. Branching seemed to be determined by the moisture content, soil texture, distance from the stem, and cultivation methods. There was a definite correlation between the total sands, the total colloids, and the root distribution. 5. Development of the Nut Grass Plant (Cyperus Rotundus L.) J. R. Jackson and E. V. Smith, Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, Auburn, Alabama. The nut grass plant consists of tubers and connecting rhizomes, rosettes of foliage leaves, and umbel-bearing scapes. New plant systems develop from isolated tubers by the growth of apical or lateral buds which produce rhizomes terminated either by rosettes of foliage leaves or by tubers arising by secondary growth of the pericycle of the rhizome. A rhizome which terminates in a rosette of foliage leaves later produces a tuber at the base of the leaves. Any new tuber formed in the system either produces rhizomes from terminal or lateral buds or becomes dormant. A system of more than one hundred tubers may be formed in one season. The plant exhibits both collateral and amphivasal bundles, clearly differentiated cortical and stelar regions, secondary growth by the pericycle, and a cork cambium. 6. A Comparative Study of the Subterranean Members of Several Crop Plants. Howard J. Dittmer, Chicago Teachers College, Chicago, Illinois. Quantitative data were obtained through counts and measurements of the roots and root hairs of Kentucky bluegrass, winter rye, oats, and soybeans. In soil samples 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep, bluegrass had far more numerous subterranean members than any of the other plants, and all grasses greatly exceeded soybeans in number, length and surface area. However, only bluegrass exceeded soybeans in volume. Based on these figures the tap root system of soybeans is very poorly adapted for binding soil. The fibrous root systems of bluegrass, winter rye, and oats are far more effective, ranking in efficiency in the order given. 7. Methods in Aerobiology. O. C. Durham, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois. In studying the aerial incidence and dispersal of pollens, fungus spores and insect particles which are recognized as causes of inhalent allergy, wide use has been made of the gravity method of sampling. Consideration is given to the advantages and disadvantages of various devices for securing rapid deposits of aerial debris and for obtaining volumetric counts. The special problems encountered in taking samples from airplanes over land and water are discussed. Attention is given to a practical technic for preparing and counting atmospheric slides. 39</page><page sequence="16">8. Changes in Grassland Vegetation in Western North Dakota 1932 Through 1939. (10 min.) (Lantern.) Warren Whitman, Herbert C. Hason and Roald Peterson, North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station, Fargo, North Dakota. The period of 1932 through 1939 included two seasons of serious drought in western North Dakota. These occurred in 1934 and 1936. The effects of these drought years on the grassland vegetation were greater than the combined effects of any other factors or groups of factors during this period. The severe seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions resulted in wide variations in abundance, density, height growth, seed production, and rela tive proportions of the constituent species of the grassland communities. These changes, however, were not as extensive nor as striking as those reported from the Central and Southern Great Plains. The most obvious effect of the two seasons of drought on the grassland vegetation was a reduction in basal area and in abundance of the principal species. The losses incurred as a result of the drought have not yet been fully made up, even after three fairly favorably seasons. Bouteloua gracilis, Agropyron smithii, and Stipa comata were all seriously affected, although the latter species made a remarkable recovery as the result of spread from surviving established clumps and from seedlings. Koeleria cristata was reduced by about 80 per cent, and Andropogon scoparius showed a 50 per cent decrease in abundance. Prac tically all species have show appreciable recovery since 1937. Both annual and perennial forbs were reduced in number during the drought years. In most cases, however, large gains were made in the succeeding years. This was especially true of the annual forbs; the perennials showed less fluctuation. Considered over the whole period of observation both perennials and annuals made a net increase. In only a few cases did they become dominant over any considerable extent of native grassland. 9. Species Senescence. (15 min.) Stanley A. Cain, University of Tennessee, Knox ville, Tennessee. The question of species senescence is considered in connection with the problem of limitation, in the East, of epibiotic species to nunnatak areas. That species senescence is a fact is questioned. It is suggested that the apparent lack of aggressiveness of such disjunct and circumscribed occurrences of a species may have a genetical explanation in the isolation of a relatively homozygous marginal portion of the species population as a whole with a resultant narrower ecological amplitude. This phenomenon, coupled with the limited occur rence of suitable edaphic situations in the region of the epibiotics, is sufficient to explain their local occurrence and lack of competitive ability in most situations. It does not seem necessary to hypothesize species "senescence", and the anthropomorphism may easily obscure true ecological explanations. 10. Plant Ecology: The Two Uses of the Term. (15 min.) (Lantern.) Frank E. Egler, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York. American and European "ecology" have developed under an unintentional isolationist policy, with the result that the term ecology now has a double usage, not adequately recog nized, and causing unnecessary confusion and criticism. To exemplify this double usage, seven leading textbooks, covering the same subject matter, are summarized in regard to nomenclature: those of Braun-Blanquet, Pavillard, Reynaud-Beauverie, Coulter Barnes &amp; Cowles, Tourney &amp; Korstian, McDougall, and Weaver &amp; Clements. In Europe, as sciences have expanded and new sciences emerged, it is accepted that the term ecology is etymo logically too restricted to embrace the many fields of knowledge emanating from the original ecology of Haeckel, in America the term, regardless of etymology, embraces all fields of botanical knowledge not orthodox morphology, physiology, taxonomy, and genetics. 11. Vegetation of a High Mountain Valley in Southern Colorado. (12 min.) (Lantern.) Francis Ramaley, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. The San Luis Valley is about 100 miles long and 40 miles wide. Annual precipitation is only 8 inches but the water-table of the central part is close to the surface. Ecologically, there are (a) floor, (b) margin, (c) rim. The floor bears a greasewood scrub (Sarcobatus) mixed with rabbit brush (Chrysothamnus). The valley margin supports a growth of under shrubs, low species of rabbit brush, snakeweed (Gutierrezie), and saze-brush (Artemisia), with much grama grass (Bouteloua) and some spring-flowering herbs. The valley rim is foothill country with open pinyon-pine woodland and grama grassland, changing to spruce pine forest at higher elevations. Plant communities besides those already noted include: river-bottom forest, sedge moor, mixed meadow, sandy-soil grassland, oak chaparral, and aspen groves. 40</page><page sequence="17">12. Unrecognized Initial Stage of Plant Succession and its Prominence in Soil Erosion Control in the South-Central United States. (12 min.) (Lantern.) W. E. Booth, Department of Botany, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas. Five members of the Myxophyceae, usually little thought of as being of great positive economic importance have been found to be of major importance in the Red Plains Region and oak savannah of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They form a complete, non-erosive layer over hundreds of acres of badly eroded and abandoned crop land. In addition to erosion control this algal growth is valuable in creating an environment favorable to plant succession. Final Business Meeting, 3:30 P.M., Orton Hall 100. Charles T. Vorhies, Chairman.
