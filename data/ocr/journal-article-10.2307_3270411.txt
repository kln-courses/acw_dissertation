VAN DER HORST Summary In antiquity prayers were said out loud and silent prayer was regarded as an anomalous practice that was looked upon with great suspicion. It was brought into connection with a variety of base motives which it was feared would be strongly objected to by others, foremost among which are wishes to practice magic, to have illicit sex, or to conceal crimes or criminal plans. It was also feared that one's prayer might be counteracted or undone by more powerful prayers of the opponents. It is only in circles of later (esp. Neo-)Platonism, in the framework of the increasing transcendentalisation in its concept of deity and the corresponding downgrading of anything material or corporeal, that complete silence as the purest form of worship was gradually accepted. This new trend had its influence on the Jewish philosopher Philo and especially on Churchfathers from Clement of Alex- andria onwards (and also on some Hermetic and Gnostic circles). But in Jewish and Christian documents there was also another motive that facilitated a gradual acceptance of silent prayer as a respectable form of worship, namely, the biblical story (in 1 Samuel 1) about Hanna's inaudible prayer that was heard by God. It is the combination of these Platonic and biblical influences that brings about a change of attitude towards speechless prayer in both Judaism and Christianity, but the evidence clearly demonstrates that this was a very slow process, because the old suspicions surrounding this phenomenon did not easily disappear. The ancients said their prayers out loud. There can be little doubt that throughout the ancient world the common practice was to say prayers in a way audible to other persons. The reason simply was that the anthropomorphic conception of the deities one prayed to implied that the gods had ears that worked in much the same way that human ears did. No sound implied no hearing. The represen- tations of the large ears of gods in a number of reliefs,' the many prayers we know were directed specifically to the ears of a deity,2 and the frequent references to Oeoi ~t7XooL (the gods who listen) in ancient literature and on monuments,3 are eloquent witnesses to this idea. The way prayers are usually mentioned in Greek and Latin literature is such that other people could hear what the pray-er was saying to the god.4 Nonetheless, from Homer onwards inaudi- ble prayers are mentioned in ancient literature, and, however much</page><page sequence="2">2 Pieter W. van der Horst these may have been regarded as a deviation from normal practice, they do make clear that beside the more 'primitive' notion that gods could only hear prayers that were spoken out loud, there also existed the opinion that gods, or at least some gods, were able to hear inaudible prayers. When silent prayer is mentioned, in most cases it is undeniably regarded as an anomaly, at least in Greek and Latin sources before the Christian period. As we shall see, in sources from the early Imperial period onwards things begin to change, and in Jewish and Christian sources we also find an increasingly different picture. We will survey the evidence, though not exhaustively, beginning with the pagan material, thereafter dealing with the Jewish and Chris- tian sources from late antiquity. Graeco-Roman evidence In our sources we find several motives mentioned for the offering of silent prayer to a deity. In order to facilitate the presentation of the material, we will subdivide the evidence according to these dif- ferent motives.5 Of course, apart from motives, there could be cir- cumstances which made it physically impossible to say one's prayer aloud. A clear instance of this is Homer, Odyssey V 444, where a tremendous wave has swept Odysseus far out to sea; struggling to the surface and trying to reach a river's mouth, "he prayed in his heart (i'tzo 8v xarX&amp; Ot'ov) to the god of the stream", obviously "because he could not speak it in the rough sea".6 This is clearly something different than a motive to pray in silence. The motive to pray without words or in an otherwise inaudible way so as to prevent enemies from hearing the prayer is first men- tioned now, because this enables us to present here the earliest reference to the phenomenon, namely in Homer, Iliad VII 191-6; after Ajax has been appointed by lot to fight Hector he says: "My friends, the lot is mine, and I am delighted, for I think I shall defeat prince Hector. I only ask you, while I am arming for the fight, to pray to Zeus the royal son of Cronos. But let your prayers be silent (mly?), so that the Trojans may not overhear you. Or pray aloud (Ie xo~ &amp;icp8Tiv)! We are afraid of nobody whatever". The great commentator Walter Leaf remarks ad locum: "The idea seems to be,</page><page sequence="3">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 3 'Do not let the Trojans hear your words, lest they endeavour to counteract your petitions by prayers of their own'; this he immediately revokes by the xao in 196, virtually = nay".7 The motif that a prayer might be counteracted or undone by more powerful prayers of the opponents is indeed to be found more fre- quently. So we find in Euripides, Electra 803-810, where a messenger speaks to Electra: "Then your mother's lover (Aegisthus) took barley and threw it on the altar with these words, 'Nymphs of these rocks, I pray that many times both I and my dear wife at home may offer sacrifice with the same fortune we enjoy today; and may Evil oppress my enemies'. Then my master (Orestes) prayed to the contrary, without speaking aloud the words (o0 yYyovLaxov X6youg), that he might possess his father's house again". Here it is obvious that Aegisthus was not supposed to hear Orestes' prayer which was meant to undo his. In Ovid's Tristia I 1, 27-30, the author says that someone will read his poem in tears, and will pray silently, so that it will not be heard by a malevolent person (et tacitus secum, ne quis malus audiat, optet [v.29]) that the emperor will become more favourably disposed towards him (i.e., Ovid in exile). We may compare here a Jewish text, Judith 13:4: after having inebriated her arch-enemy, Holophernes, with liquor so that he has fallen asleep, "Judith, standing beside his bed, prayed in her heart: Oh Lord, etc." (ara o Ilout onapa tlv xXivrlv aOt5 i7nV V bV XTrxpLltj T' XtpLE Xt .; cf. 1 Sam. 1:13). The silence of her prayer is here motivated by the fact that the drunken Holophernes should not be awakened by her prayer before she would kill him.8 Xenophon of Ephesus, Ephesiaca IV 5, states that only when the heroine, Anthia, was out of earshot of one of her kid- nappers who wanted to make love to her, she dared to exclaim: "I pray that I may remain the wife of Habrocomes, etc."' A second motive to be discerned is the malevolence of some supernatural powers, especially the Erinyes/Eumenides, who are not prayed to out loud, because mentioning their names (which was indispensible in ancient prayers) might evoke their noxious activities. Hence prayers to these goddesses were often soundless. In Aeschylus, Eumenides 1035 and 1039, in the final song of the chorus, the women sing: "Bless them [sc. the daughters of the night = Eumenides/Erinyes] with silence ("EQL.t)P E 8P)". Cf. idem,</page><page sequence="4">4 Pieter W. van der Horst Choephoroi 95-6: (87 "What shall I say as I pour out these outpour- ings of sorrow? ....) Or shall I, without word or rite, in such fashion as my father was put away, pour out this offering for the ground to drink? (i tZy' &amp;tEvoo, 65at p oiv d&amp;cto ?tti pp, ' t xxeouax ya'norov Xyatv xzx.)", the libation being here, of course, an offering to the chthonic Eumenides. Also Sophocles, Oedipus Coloneus 124- 133: when the chorus sees Oedipus withdrawing into the sacred grove of the Eumenides, they say: "The old man must be a vaga- bond, not of our land, for he would never otherwise dare to go in there, in the inviolate thicket of those whom it is futile to fight, those whom we tremble to name, whom we pass averting our eyes, in silence, without conversation, shaping our prayers with our lips (aq rp4Ltotev X-YLV, xOC 0 npautp6, OLEO ,a'pxs), &amp;ocp(V, qqcc ,&amp;6y-)oC t6 trq e1P0tOU at6ica (9pov'T8o0 [vreq)". Also OC 489, where the chorus teaches Oedipus how to pray to these goddesses, namely so "that the Eumenides, as we call them-which means the gentle of heart-may accept with gentleness the suppliant and his wish. So you, or he who prays for you, address them, but do not speak aloud or raise a cry (&amp;nuaar cgpov&amp;v tvrl8 ?rlnx6iov 3o'iv)". In this connec- tion it should be mentioned that in Athens the priestesses of the chthonic Semnai Theai = Erinyes were called the Hesychides, the 'Silent Ones' (e.g. Callimachus, fr. 123).10 A third important motive to pray in silence was that the pray-er felt embarrassment about what he or she was going to pray for. When in Catullus 64, 103-4, Ariadne sees Theseus arriving at Crete, she feels her desire for him fired and for that reason she prays that he may be saved from the Minotaur: "Yet not without return or in vain were the gifts she promised to the gods when on her lips she kindled the silent breath of vows" (non ingrata tamen frustra munuscula divis/ promittens tacito succepit vota labello)."1 In Tibullus III 11 = IV 5, 17-20 we read: "The boy wants the same as me [namely, love or sex], but does not openly pour his heart out. He is too shy to say such things in public. But you, his birth-god, a god from whom nothing is hidden, hear our prayer. What does it matter whether he says it to himself or openly?" (optat idem iuvenis quod nos, sed tectius optat; nam pudet haec illum dicere verba palam. at tu, natalis, qoniam deus omnia sentis, adnue; quid refert, clamne palamne roget?). Cf. also Tibullus II 1,</page><page sequence="5">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 5 84-6 "Call him [i.e., Cupid] aloud to the flock, but in silence to yourselves-or even aloud to yourselves, for the din of the merry crowd and the skirl of the Phrygian pipe will drown the words" (voce palam pecori, clam sibi quisque vocet, aut etiam sibi quisque palam; nam turba iocosa obstrepit et Phrygia tibia curva sono); and III 12 = IV 6, 15-16 (about a mother who teaches her daughter on her birthday a fitting prayer to luno Natalis, but the girl has fallen into passion): "Her fond mother dictates the prayer she wants to pray, but the girl knows her own mind, and in the stillness of her heart utters quite a different prayer" (praecipit et natae mater studiosa quod optet: illa aliud tacita, iam sua, mente rogat). As a final example we mention Juvenal, Satura X 289-291: "When the loving mother passes the temple of Venus, she prays in whispered breath (modico ... murmure) for her boys that they may have beauty, but more loudly, and entering into the most trifling details, the same for her daughters".12 In all the instances quoted we see that the reason for embarrass- ment is to be found in the fact that what is prayed for lies in the erotic or sexual sphere.'3 Hence it is oa8tih or pudor, a feeling of shame, that requires the prayer to be said in silence. "It is above all where love is concerned that man, even ancient man, confided his secrets to a god not to his neighbour"." In this connection it is interesting to notice that this almost certainly accounts for the existence of an "Aphrodite Psithuros, 'the whisperer', since it was customary to whisper prayers in her ear".' Seneca seems to refer to such a practice when he says at the end of Epist. X 5: "But I must, as is my custom, send a little gift along with this letter. It is a true saying which I found in Athenodorus: 'Know that thou art freed from all desires when thou hast reached such a point that thou prayest to God for nothing except what thou canst pray for openly'. But how foolish men are now! They whisper the basest of prayers to heaven, but if anyone listens, they are silent at once. That which they are unwilling for men to know, they communicate to God. Do you not think, then, that some such wholesome advice as this could be given you: 'Live among men as if God beheld you; speak with God as if men were listening'? Farewell!" (Sed ut more meo cum aliquo munusculo epistulam mittam, verum est quod apud Athenodorum inveni: "Tunc scito esse te omnibus cupiditatibus</page><page sequence="6">6 Pieter W. van der Horst solutum, cum eo perveneris, ut nihil deum roges nisi quod rogare possis palam" [fr. de superstitione 36].16 Nunc enim quanta dementia est hominum! Turpissima vota dis insussurant; si quis admoverit aurem, conticescent. Et quod scire hominem nolunt, deo narrant. Vide ergo, ne hoc praecipi salubriter possit: sic vive cum hominibus tamquam deus videbat; sic loquere cum deo tamquam homines audiant. Vale!).'7 A fourth important motive for praying in silence, or at least inaudibly for other persons, is not so much the erotic or sexual nature of what is prayed for, but the otherwise unacceptable or even criminal character of the petition. As my countryman Henk Versnel remarked: "Now, there is nothing very attractive about wishing out loud in a temple magna stante corona that neighbour, rival or emperor should die as soon as possible. Yet this was a normal component of the various wishes expressed and in such cases it was customary to murmur the prayer between one's lips or to say it in complete silence, so that the connection between silent prayer and evil became a topos in literature".18 The well-known curses inscribed on the defixionum tabellae are very illustratative in this respect. Let us here give some examples from literary sources. Martialis, Epigr. I 39, 5-6.8: "If anyone is the protector of what is right, an admirer of all that is honourable, and a man who asks nothing of the gods with inaudible voice, (...), damn me if it isn't Decianus!" (si quis erit recti custos, mirator honesti/ et nihil arcano qui roget ore deos,/ (...,) / dispeream si non hic Decianus erit).19 Horace, Epist. I 16, 57-62: "This 'good man', which the whole forum and tribunal looks at, whenever with swine or ox he makes atonement to the gods, cries with loud voice 'Father Janus!', with loud voice 'Apollo!', then moves only his lips, fearing to be heard: 'Fair Laverna, grant me to escape detection, grant me to pass as just and upright, shroud my sins in night, my lies in clouds!' " (vir bonus, omne forum quem spectat et omne tribunal, quandocumque deos vel porco vel bove placat, "Iane pater!" clare, clare cum dixit "Apollo!", labra movet metuens audiri: "Pulchra Laverna, da mihi fallere, da iusto santoque videri, noctem peccatis et fraudibus obice nebem"). Since Laverna is the goddess of theft,20 the implica- tion of Horace's satyrical picture is clear: it is only in an inaudible</page><page sequence="7">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 7 way that one could say a prayer to the effect that one's misde- meanours would not be discovered.21 In De Benef VI 38, 1-5, Seneca complains that so many people pray in secret for the same thing (2: omnes enim idem volunt, id est, intra se optant), namely money or gain acquired in a dishonest way. In ? 5 he continues: "Yet the prayers of all these men, while well known, are unpunished. Lastly, let every man examine himself, let him retire into the secrecy of his heart and discover what it is that he has silently prayed for. How many prayers there are which he blushes to acknowledge, even to himself! How few that we could make in the hearing of a witness!" (omnium tamen istorum tam nota sunt vota quam impunita; denique se quisque consulat et in secretum pectoris sui redeat et inspiciat quid tacitus optaverit. quam multa sunt vota quae etiam sibi fateri pudet! quam pauca quae facere coram teste possimus!). A final instance is Pliny, Panegyricus 67,5: "At your instigation, Caesar, the state has struck a bargain with the gods that they shall preserve your health and safety as long as you do the same for everyone else; otherwise they are to turn their attention from protecting your life, and to abandon you to such vows as are taken in secret" (teque relinquerent votis quae non palam susciperentur). Pliny implies that prayers for the health and safety of the emperor will be turned into their opposite when he does not keep to the agreement between himself and the Roman state. However, such prayers will then be uttered non palam. But here we are already touching upon another motive for silent or murmured prayer, namely the practice of magic, black magic in most cases, which is most frequently mentioned in ancient sources as a reason for inaudible praying. There can be little doubt that it was the notorious character of magic in the view of most ancients that made practitioners hide the contents of their prayers, or rather curses and spells; hence these were often said either silently or in a low voice or murmur. It should be said here in advance that in the sources one finds an indiscriminate use of terms like tacita prex or susurrus (the sound made by one speaking in a low voice or a whisper) or murmur. It should be borne in mind here that tacite, 'silently', could not infrequently have the sense of 'in a quiet or low murmur'.22 For instance, Ovid, Metamorphoses VI 203 and a scholion on Juvenal VI 587 speak about taciturn murmur, a very soft</page><page sequence="8">8 Pieter W. van der Horst (and hence inaudible) murmur. The emphasis is on the fact that what is being said in certain magical prayers cannot be heard in an articulate way by other persons. Most instances are found in Latin poets, presumably because in the early Empire magic began to flourish more than ever before. Ovid, Metamorphoses VII 251-4, writes about the magician Medea in Thessaly: "And when in long low-murmured supplications the deities were appeased, she bade bring out the old exhausted king, and with a spell charmed him to deepest sleep and lay his body, lifeless it seemed, stretched on a bed of herbs" (quos ubi placavit precibusque et murmure longo,/Aesonis effoetum proferri corpus ad auras/ iussit, et in plenos resolutum carmine somnos,/ exanimi similem stratis porrexit in herbis).23 Ibid. IX 300-1: "She [the god- dess of birth, Lucina] barred the birth [of Hercules with Alcmene] and chanted silent spells, spells that held back the birth as it began (sustinuit partus; tacita quoque carmina voce/ dixit, et inceptos tenuerunt carmina partus)".24 Ibid. XIV 57-8 (on Circe): "Then only with her witch's lips she muttered thrice nine times a baffling maze of magic incantations" (... obscurum verborum ambage novorum/ter noviens carmen magico demurmurat ore).25 Lucan, Pharsalia VI 699-701 (in a setting of magic): "I invoke ... the lowest form of our Hecate, through whom the shades and I may commune in silent utterence (mihi sunt tacitae commercia linguae)".26 Horace, Epode V 49 (on a magician's spell): "What did she say, or rather what did she leave unsaid?" (quid dixit aut quid tacuit?), with a nice self-correction by Horace. Juvenal, Satura VI 539-541 (on Anubis): "His tears and carefully studied mutterings make sure that Osiris will not refuse a pardon for the fault, bribed, no doubt, by a fat goose and a slice of sacrificial cake" (illius lacrimae meditataque murmura praestant/ ut veniam culpae non abnuat, ansere magno/ scilicet et tenui popano corruptus Osiris). Apuleius, Metamorphoses II 28 (about an Egyptian magician who has been summoned to revive a dead body): "At this the prophet was moved, and took a certain herb, and laid it three times upon the mouth of the dead, and he took another and laid it upon his breast in like sort. Then he turned himself to the East and made silently certain prayers to the proud and rising sun, which caused all the people to marvel greatly at the sight of this solemn act and to look</page><page sequence="9">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 9 for the strange miracle that should happen" (propheta sic pro- pitiatus herbulam quampiam ob os corporis et aliam pectori eius imponit. tunc orientem obversus incrementa solis augusti tacitus imprecatus venerabilis scaenae facie studia praesentium ad miraculum tantum certatim adrexit).27 In his Apologia 54,7 Apuleius, who has been accused of magical practices, makes fun of unfounded accusations of magic: "Did you say silent prayers to the gods in the temple? Then you are a magician!" (Tacitas preces in templo deis allegasti: igitur magus es!).28 Lucian, Menippus 7: a Chaldaean brings Menippus down to visit the underworld; during the trip plenty of use is made of incantations: "He spoke rapidly and indistinctly. It is likely, however, that he was invoking certain spirits ... murmuring his incantations" (dtCTpoX6v TL xait &amp; mcpq cpO yTTTo. 72CXTlv EC)XL y TE tvoCm tLXXcFk.7t-aOt 8mtLovoCq ... T lv tCO)v jtnozov0opu6am;). Achilles Tatius II 7: "She moved closer and put her mouth near mine in order to mumble her charm over the wound; she whispered the formula (~4t06ptCLv)...". And in the great magical papyrus from Paris (PGM IV) we read in lines 744-6 that the magi- cian has to say the spell over someone's head "with a weak voice (&amp;t6vc cp06yyc') so that he may not hear it".29 As late as the sixth century CE the anonymous Christian author of the so-called Opus imperfectum in Matthaeum remarks on the magoi in Mt. 2: "Diceban- tur Magi lingua eorum, quia in silentio et voce tacita Deum glorificabant. (...) laudabant in silentio Deum tribus diebus"! (MG 56, 637).30 Finally, a completely new motive to say prayers without words evolved hand in hand with a change in the conception of the nature of deity. It was of course in philosophical circles that this change took its point of departure. Now it should be said beforehand that there had always been Greeks and Romans who believed that gods could hear prayers without words. In Sophocles, Electra 655-8, Clytemnaestra says: "These are my prayers, Lycaean Apollo, hear them graciously. Grant to all of us what we ask. For all the rest, although I am silent, I know you are a God and know it all" (ztoGz', J A'xet' "`A=oovTO, XC; XX'COV / 60% tC=a1v 'ff1V 60'CaMP ctO4LZOc1 . / z&amp; 8' O~ X Vt n vza XML at tcia7j; .1ou'- / 2tnLCO a .) a Uatov' o6vz 't?s&amp;vat). And Cicero, De Divinatione I 129, says that "the minds of the gods, without eyes, ears or tongue are mutually aware of</page><page sequence="10">10 Pieter W. van der Horst what any of them feels or thinks, so that men, even when they wish or vow something silently, have no doubt of being heard" (deorum animi sine oculis, sine auribus, sine lingua sentiunt inter se quid quisque sentiat, ex quo fit ut homines, etiam cum taciti optent quid aut voveant, non dubitent quin di illud exaudiant). And some more passages in this vein could be quoted."3 But it should be added that this was probably not a widespread belief. It was mainly the later Platonists, with their ever more elevated conception of the purely immaterial, noetic divine world and especially their theologia negativa,32 which gave a decisive impulse to the new concept of silent prayer as the only fitting means of wor- shipping God. To a lesser extent also the Stoics, with their concept of the deity as permeating not only the whole cosmos but also all human beings, contributed to this process. As to the Stoic view, there is the hackneyed quotation from Seneca, Epistula XLI 1: "We do not need to uplift our hands towards heaven, or to beg the keeper of a temple to let us approach his idol's ear, as if in this way our prayers are more likely to be heard. God is near you, he is with you, he is within you" (non sunt ad caelum elevandae manus nec exorandus aedituus, ut nos ad aurem simulacri, quasi magis exaudiri possimus, admittat; prope est a te deus, tecum est, intus est). Communing with a god who is within you can be accom- plished without words, say the Stoics. But it is the Platonic view that turned out to be of a much more lasting influence. The clearest expression can be found in the writings of the Neoplatonists,33 to begin with Plotinus, Ennead V 1,6: "We first invoke God himself, not in loud word, but in that way of prayer which is always within our power, leaning in soul towards Him by aspiration, alone towards the alone" (086v OauT6v EnLXX(Xaa?LE'Vo oq X6yc u ylycXvi, &amp;XX&amp; 'p 4Uux' XT E ktoi L UXC71v npo EXLVOV,, 0iCxaot to tov toov tp6otov uv.tvotE , 6votUq tCP6 p?6vov). Plotinus' pupil Porphyry says in his De abstinentia II 34,2: "Let us sacrifice in such a manner as is fit, offering different sacrifices to different powers; to the God who is above all things, as a certain wise man said, neither sacrificing nor consecrating anything that belongs to the world of the senses. For there is nothing material which is not immediately impure to an immaterial nature. Hence neither is vocal language nor internal speech</page><page sequence="11">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 11 adapted to the highest god, when it is defiled by any passion of the soul; but we should venerate him in profound silence with a pure soul and with pure conceptions about him" (O@eC ~iv t Et In at, 6W "tL &amp;v7lp aoqOb 7grl, [.rl7tv tG)v o.iOrlpc a7v [ O4ueLqS)Vt y/L7Te enovoytL&amp;ovre- ot686iv y p iTLv e"Vt.)XoVB0 e, tvq' &amp; OXq xt.)Ot ieTLV &amp;x&amp;Op.0cov.

There can be little doubt that the 'certain wise man' here is the first century philosopher and miracle-worker Apollonius from Thyana, whose well-known ideas on spiritual sacrifice (in his Hep' Ouat.&amp;v) would seem to be extrapolated here by Porphyry to prayer.34 In Ad Marcellam 16 Por- phyry states that a sage honours god by his silence (aocp'q y&amp;p &amp;vilp xod atTyCaV O v ~uytl (cf. Ep. ad Aneb. 5)).35 He also quotes an oracle of Apollo to the effect that the gods have to be called upon with "ineffable callings" (x),laeatLv &amp;qOcpyxotL, in his De philosophia ex oraculis haurienda, ap. Eusebius, PE V 14, 1). Iamblichus claims in De Mysteriis VIII 3 that he is rendering ancient Egyptian wisdom according to the earliest records by 'Hermes' on the proper worship of the highest principle, the god of gods, "which can be worshipped by silence only" (' "84 xod &amp; W y fty 6vr?l 0qpocnpe"vuot). And the late Neoplatonic author Proclus also emphasizes that only by com- pletely silencing our whole body may we gain knowledge of the gods (t6o t&amp; q e tO6'(T3Lwa 5v 8c L ta vo0 yvWoada6~eO y6vwo, 6 Tav tyilev t~sa i Vg TSv at LoEaztxaS lOaaLo~tv, In remp. II 243, 24 Kroll).36 The same conception can also be found in the Hermetic literature, e.g. in Corpus Hermeticum I (Poimandres) 30-31 we read in a context of worship of the highest god: I atontl .ouLO lyx6'?Lv zoG &amp;ya0Oo, 'my silence was pregnant of good things'; and the deity is called upon as "the ineffable, the unspeakable, the one who can only be called upon by silence" (&amp;vexXd0X'iut, &amp;pp1tss, aL-tnr? gvo6yeve)."7 In CH X 5 the beauty of the Good One is incom- prehensible (0tt-qov), a human being can say nothing about it, because the gnosis of it is a divine silence (0fiE aLfltwl). The unknown God is unknowable, but reveals himself in a contemplative silence.38 It is clear that the idea of God as pure nous and nooumenon, whose worship hence can only be carried out in a purely noetical, that is incorporeal, way, inevitably leads to a worship in total silence."</page><page sequence="12">12 Pieter W. van der Horst We cannot expatiate here on the role and importance of silence in Gnosticism (it falls outside my sphere of competence and interest),40 but it may be noted that it is significant that in some Nag Hammadi texts the aeon Sophia is even identified with (the hypostasized) Sige (e.g. NHC III 3, 88, 8-9) and that the heavenly 'masculine female virgin Ioel' is called "the silence of silent silence" (NHC IV 2, 55, 18).41 (And cf. also Irenaeus, Adv. Haereses I 11, 5 on Sige as a divine being among the Gnostics). That a divine being called 'Silence' will have been worshipped in silence stands to reason. Now although Platonic influence on various gnostic systems seems undeniable, we certainly need not attribute the importance of silence among the Gnostics to that philosophy alone. There were probably other factors at work here as well, which may derive from the Jewish and Christian traditions. This leads us to the second section of our material, namely the Jewish and Christian evidence. Jewish evidence Although in these two monotheistic religions audible prayer was also the predominant custom, certainly initially, there were right from the start some elements that made for a significant difference. For Judaism the most important factor simply was that in the Bible there was a story about someone praying in silence who, although being frowned upon by Eli the priest, was heard favourably by God. This story is of course the narrative about Hanna in 1 Sam. 1. There Hanna, one of the two wives of Elkana, prays in the tem- ple at Silo in a mood of despair because she had remained childless so far, in contrast to the other wife of Elkana. As she continued praying, so the biblical text says, "Eli observed her mouth: Hanna was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk" (1 Sam. 1:12-13 LXX xod Ry vyilOrq - e nX "Ouvev poae ol?lvl ivcfltLOV xVp7o1 xod HXL 6 l 1)p6Xaoev t6 at67 jx ototij' c .

But her prayer that God would bless her with a child was heard, which implied that her words not only were under- stood by God but also found favour in God's eyes. It is not surpris-</page><page sequence="13">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 13 ing that, even though this is the only story in the Bible that speaks about silent prayer, this was bound to exert its influence in Jewish prayer practice. The first post-biblical Jewish author to mention silent prayer was the philosopher-exegete Philo of Alexandria. Although he does not reflect on this biblical text, he does speak in a very positive sense about silent prayer, but this is most probably due to his being so deeply steeped in Platonic ideas about God. In De plantatione Noe 126 Philo says: "[Gratitude to God] must be expressed by means of hymns of praise, and these not such as the audible voice will sing (otX ok 1 ysyTcov6 S ~aet cpov~), but strains raised and re-echoed by the mind too pure for the eye to discern", a phraseology more reminiscent of the just quoted Hermetic and Neoplatonic passages than of 1 Sam. 1. But in De specialibus legibus I 272: "[The worship- pers] honour with hymns and thanksgivings their benefactor and saviour, God, sometimes with the organs of speech, sometimes without tongue or mouth (&amp;veu yXc',Url xd at~6Ltrog), when within the soul alone their minds recite the tale or utter the cry of praise", the words "without tongue or lips" are more reminiscent of the words in 1 Sam. 1, which makes one wonder whether perhaps here Plato does meet Samuel, so to speak. But when in De gigantibus 52 Philo writes that we have to contemplate to the Existent (ctb iv) without speech and within the soul alone (&amp;v~ eu cvin gi6vo nuuX,), the terminology is so much like what we find in the later Platonists that one suspects that 'Plato' was a stronger influence on Philo than 'Samuel', here as well as elsewhere. Although Philo should have been rather dealt with in the paragraph on Platonism, we treat him as a Jewish writer because that may help us understand why and how in early Christianity, on which Philo had such a great influ- ence,42 it was also this combination of biblical and Platonic elements that facilitated the acceptance and propagation of silent prayer. Pseudo-Philo, however, does reflect on our biblical passage in his Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum 50:5, where he rewrites the story of Hanna and Elkana: "And Hanna did not want to pray out loud as all people do; for she thought saying: 'Perhaps I am not worthy to be heard, and Peninnah will then be even more eager to taunt me, ' " (et noluit Anna orare clara voce sicut omnes homines. tunc</page><page sequence="14">14 Pieter W. van der Horst enim cogitavit dicens: ne forte non sim digna exaudiri et erit ut plus me zelans improperet mihi Fehenna). Although the author is aware of the deviation from common practice (as all people do), he tries to give us a glimpse into Hanna's mind so as to enable us to under- stand her complete departure from common prayer practice. It was fear to be even more taunted by her rival than before, if her prayer would have no effect, that makes her pray in silence. Respectable motives will recur in other Jewish reflections on our passage. It is harder to discover what was the motive behind the passage in the Greek Vita Adae et Evae 29:7, where at least a number of manuscripts state that Adam after his expulsion from Paradise says to Eve: "Cry in silence to God: Oh God, have mercy on me!" (atyo f P36loov t~ Oe"4 6 OOe6, [,i~aOtL' otL), which is clarified in the Latin version as follows (6:2): "Let no speech come out of your mouth, because we are unworthy to entreat the Lord since our lips are unclean from the illegal and forbidden tree". Here at least the second quotation makes clear that uncleanness of lips because of the eating of the forbidden fruit is a reason either to pray not at all or to pray in silence; but it has to be added that both versions taken on their own are much less clear than taken together. Josephus tells in Bellum III 353-4 that shortly before his surrender to the Romans he is hiding from the Romans with 40 revolutionary notables from Jotapata. "Recalling the dreadful images of recent dreams, he offered up a silent prayer to God (npoacpipEL t 0eC XXsOtutov XTlv). 'Since it pleases thee', so it ran, 'who didst create the Jewish nation, to break thy work, since fortune has wholly passed to the Romans, and since thou hast made choice of my spirit to announce the things that are to come, I willingly surrender to the Romans and consent to live; but I take thee to witness that I go, not as a traitor, but as thy minister'." Much has been said about this embarrassing passage, but for our purposes the relevant aspect is that here we have simply another instance of fear of being heard by others who certainly would have viewed him as a traitor. When we now turn to rabbinic literature, we see that there is a relative scarcity of evidence when we compare it to the enormous bulk of early rabbinic literature as a whole and to the numerous pages devoted therein to prayers said out loud. We find some brief remarks on silent prayer in the Mishna and Talmud treatise</page><page sequence="15">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 15 Berakhot, as was to be expected, and a couple of references else- where.43 Nonetheless they are revealing. Let us begin with the earliest testimony, Mishna Berakhot III 4-5, where we read: "One who has had a seminal discharge recites (the Shema) silently" (lit.: he ponders over it in his heart); he should altogether refrain from the blessings before and after the Shema; and should he have already started to recite the Tefillah (= the Eighteen Benedictions) but remembered that he had had a seminal emission, he should not stop the prayer but shorten it. The point here is that reciting the Shema is not praying in the proper sense, because it actually is 'reading' of Scripture,44 so the man who is unclean (because of his seminal emission) may recite the Shema, albeit silently, but because he is unfit for immediate contact with the deity, he may not recite berakhot, the prayers of blessing; and although he may go on with the Tefillah when he remembers too late that he is impure because of a seminal emission, he should absolutely shorten the prayer; breaking it off would be an offence to the deity, but he should beware of staying too long in direct contact with the divine sphere and therefore abbreviate his prayer (by taking recourse to a shortened version of the prayer, tefillah qetsirah). However, the Mishna also explicitly states that not all rabbis were of the same opinion: Rabbi Judah said that such a man was allowed to say all prayers!45 We now take a short glance at the Gemara, that is the discussion of this Mishna passage by the Babylonian rabbis of the third through sixth centuries in the Babylonian Talmud (Bavli). In Bavli Berakhot 20b-21a one sees that the mishnaic passage elicits a debate: Rabina says that it demonstrates that silent recitation is equivalent to reciting aloud; otherwise why should he say Shema in silence? But Rav Hisda combats this view: The two are not equivalent, other- wise why not let him utter the words, with his lips? And so it goes on about the Shema. But then the rabbis switch to the Eighteen Benedictions, Tefillah. "Tefillah is different because it does not mention the kingdom of heaven" (21a). What does this mean? In the Eighteen Benedictions the address melekh hacolam, 'King of the Universe', does not occur, and that is the reason why, in con- tradistinction to the other berakhot, this one can be said to the end when a man suddenly remembers his seminal emission, although</page><page sequence="16">16 Pieter W. van der Horst he should keep it as brief as possible out of reverence. A baraitha in Berakhot 31 a teaches that Rabbi Akiva frequently indulged in silent prayer in the synagogue, so great was his concentration (kawwanah); and in this connection the rabbis refer to Hanna's example in 1 Sam. 1:13 and add that Solomon's request in 1 Kings 8:28, "Attend, o Lord my God, to the prayer and the supplication of thy servant, listen to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you this day", demonstrates that there is a difference between an official prayer (said out loud) and a supplication (said in silence). Bavli Sotah 32b is a beautiful passage in that it suggests as a motif of silent prayer the desirability to prevent transgressors from being put to shame: if a person recites the Eighteen Benedic- tions aloud, the sinner who confesses his/her sins in the course of prayer, will be put to shame, and therefore it is better that the prayer be said softly. One is reminded of Luke 18:9-14 where the publican is put to shame by the Pharisee in a situation of prayer said out loud.46 Let me finally refer to some passages in the Midrash on Psalms. In IV 9 we read: "The Holy One, blessed be He, declared to Israel: I say unto you: When you would pray, go to the synagogue in your city; when you cannot go to the synagogue in your city, pray in your open field; when you cannot go to your open field, pray in your house; when you cannot go to your house, pray upon your bed; when you cannot pray aloud on your bed, commune with your heart. Hence it is written: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still (Ps. 4:5)". And in XIX 2 silence is called "the height of all praises of God".47 Christian evidence Finally the Christian material, in which we see various threads coming together. It was the great commentator of Cicero, Arthur Stanley Pease, who once suggested that the fact that silent prayers were far more generally employed in Christian usage was perhaps due to the influence of such passages as Matth. 6:6.48 In this passage of the Sermon on the Mount we read that Jesus said by way of instruction for prayer: "When you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father in secret, and your Father</page><page sequence="17">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 17 who sees in secret will reward you". The context makes clear beyond any doubt that this is a warning against ostentatious prayer, but is it an encouragement of silent prayer? Does praying not in the street but in the privacy of one's own room imply praying in silence? The point would rather seem to be this: "Prayer is for God alone; it requires no human audience. The soul in prayer must be turned only towards God"."9 The fact that one should withdraw to a place where one is alone would rather seem to suggest that one should look for a place where one's prayers, spoken out loud, can- not be heard by others. So although I am not inclined to follow A.S. Pease in his interpretation of Matth. 6:6, what Jesus says a couple of lines further, "your Father knows what you need before you ask him" (6:8), may indeed suggest that God has no need of human words in order to know what is in their hearts, which is a well- known motif from biblical and post-biblical Jewish sources.50 Even though this still is definitely not identical to a command to say prayers silently, it is conceivable that such elements in the gospel tradition have facilitated the acceptance of silent prayer as a respec- table way of communicating with God. In addition to that, another New Testament injunction, namely Paul's exhortation to pray con- stantly (1 Thess. 5:17) cannot have been meant and understood otherwise than that the believers should be with their hearts in con- tinuous contact with God, not that they should say prayers out loud all day. It should be conceded, however, to Pease (although he is not aware of it), that in the exegesis of some of the Church Fathers it is indeed Matt. 6:6 that is used to encourage praying in silence. The impact of Platonism on Christian views of prayer is discerni- ble in the earliest Christian writer to discuss silent prayer, Clement of Alexandria. In his Stromateis he devotes a whole chapter (VII 7) to the questions of what sort of prayer the real believer should employ and how it is heard by God. Some quotations may suffice: VII 7, 37, 1 "God does not possess human form in order to hear, nor does he need senses, as the Stoics think, 'especially hearing and sight, for otherwise he could never perceive something' ". VII 7, 37, 3 "And should anyone say that the voice does not reach God, but is rolled downwards in the air, yet the thoughts of the saints cleave not only the air but the whole world". VII 7, 37, 5 "And what voice should he wait for, he who, according to his purpose,</page><page sequence="18">18 Pieter W. van der Horst knows the elect already before his birth, and knows what is still to be as already existent?" VII 7, 39, 6 "Prayer is then, to speak more boldly, converse with God. Though whispering, consequently, and not opening the lips we speak in silence, yet we cry inwardly. For God hears continually all the inward converse". VII 7, 43, 4 "God does not wait for loquacious tongues, as interpreters among men, but knows absolutely the thoughts of all; and what the voice intimates to us, that is what our thought, which even before the creation He knew would come into our mind, speaks to God. Prayer, then, may be uttered without the voice".51 It is clear that it is not only philosophical motives but also the biblical and Jewish- Christian idea that God knows the thoughts of all men that plays a role here. From about the same period is the passage in the apocryphal Acta Petri 39 (= Martyrium Petri 10), where Peter has been crucified and from the cross he utters a prayer that contains the following passage: "Now whereas thou hast made known and revealed these things unto me, O word of life, called now by me wood [or: word called now by me tree of life], I give thee thanks, not with these lips that are nailed unto the cross, nor with this tongue by which truth and falsehood issue forth, nor with this word which cometh forth by means of art whose nature is material, but with that voice do I give thee thanks, 0 King, which is perceived in silence (8&amp;&amp; ort~Y vooulivi), which is not heard openly, which proceedeth not forth by organs of the body, which goes not into ears of flesh, which is not heard of corruptible substance, which existeth not in the world, neither is sent forth upon earth, nor written in books, which is owned by one but not by another; but with this, 0 Jesus Christ, do I give thee thanks, with the silence of a voice (aty , cpwvJ1), wherewith the spirit that is in me loveth thee, speaketh unto thee, seeth thee, and beseecheth thee".52 And also in the same period Tertullian (De oratione 17,3-4) and some decades later Cyprian (De dominica oratione 4-5) stress that God does not so much listen to the voice as to the heart of men: Deus autem non vocis sed cordis auditor est. But it is interesting to see that Tertullian, in order to prove that God can not only see into the hearts of men but also hear their thoughts, refers first to a pagan oracle of Apollo which says that the god understands the mute and hears the one who does not</page><page sequence="19">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 19 speak,53 and only then to a biblical example (namely the example of Jona's prayer from the belly of the whale), whereas Cyprian instead first refers to Matth. 6:6 and then to 1 Sam 1, Hanna's example, to drive home the necessity of silent prayer.54 All this was written by them of course because silent prayer was not, or at least not commonly, practised among their co-religionists. This is also evident from a passage in Hippolytus' treatise The Apostolic Tradi- tion, where he says: "If you are at home, pray at the third hour and praise God; but if you are elsewhere and that moment comes, pray then in your heart to God" (36:2, p. 62-3 ed. G. Dix). Here, of course, also the motive not to provoke inimical gentiles plays a role. That the biblical example of Hanna was not forgotten is clear again from a passage in Cyril of Jerusalem, Procatechesis 14 (from the middle of the 4th cent.): the catechumens are waiting for the individual prebaptismal exorcisms to be finished. The men are to sit together reading aloud or praying. "But let the young women's group gather in such a way that, whether it is praying psalms or reading in silence, their lips move but the ears of others do not hear. 'For I do not permit a woman to speak in church' [1 Cor. 14:34, quoted freely]. And let the married woman do likewise, and let her pray and move her lips, but let no sound be heard (xit ICpoaEuX'tao, xa'd t XEiel XLVE6OO, XOyv' 81 &amp; xoukO&amp;a), so that Samuel may come, so that your barren soul may give birth to the salvation of God who hears you; for that is what Samuel means".55 The interesting thing in this passage is that Hanna's example is here used (or misused) to enforce the implementation of the apostle Paul's injunction that women should be silent in the church (con- trast Origen's use of the story of Hanna in De oratione 13). In his exposition of Matth. 6:6 (the text discussed above), Jerome says that on the face of it this verse seems to prohibit only vainglorious praying, but there is more to it: it rather prescribes that one should pray with closed lips, in the heart, just like Hanna did, as we read in the book of Kings (sed mihi videtur magis esse praeceptum ut inclusa pectoris cogitatione labiisque compressis oremus Dominum, quod et Annam in Regum volumine fecisse legimus, In Mattheum I, ad 6:6). Another factor in the Christian development of praying in silence may have been that in and after the fourth century the ideal of</page><page sequence="20">20 Pieter W. van der Horst silence in the early monasteries must have contributed to an atmosphere in which praying silently became more and more acceptable. John Cassian (early fifth cent.), in his Conlatio IX 35, says that monks should pray in complete silence (clauso oramus ostio, cum strictis labiis silentio supplicamus non vocum sed cor- dium scrutatori. ...cum summo est orandum silentio) because otherwise one disturbs others in their prayers (ne fratres adstantes nostris susurris vel clamoribus avocemus et orantium sensibus obstrepamus) and one should also see to it that 'our enemies' (here probably the demons)56 do not get to know what we are praying (ut ipsos quoque inimicos nostros, qui orantibus nobis maxime insi- diantur, lateat nostrae petitionis intentio). Pure prayer can only be conducted in silence."57 And another monk, Evagrius Ponticus, argues in his De oratione that prayer is the complete expulsion of all thoughts, and glorifies the ideal of silent, even unconscious prayer.58 But nonetheless one does not at all get the impression that silent private prayer quickly and easily made itself the usual pattern of prayer behaviour in Christian antiquity. In the third century Apostolic Constitutions it is said with some wonder in one of the prayers in the 7th book that God is "the one who even knows the petitions which are kept silent (6 xatL at1ocptvac StratLevoq ev6~eLtS, VII 33, 2)", as if that was something unheard of. It is also striking that a Christian Platonist like Origen throughout his treatise On Prayer takes for granted that prayers were spoken out loud.59 In De Civitate Dei XXII 8 Augustine tells us a story which definitely conveys the impression that praying aloud was still customary while praying 'in the heart' was exceptional. It is only in the early decades of the 5th century that we find the first explicit prescription to pray silently, in John Cassian, but that is meant for monks only. The fact that in the first half of the 6th century the Justinian Novella 137:6 orders the prayers in the administration of the sacraments to be uttered not silently but in such a way that the congregation can hear them, makes one wonder whether the old suspicion of magic where prayers were being said silently still lingered on in that time.60 To summarize, in pagan antiquity about the turn of the era silent prayer, in spite of all the negative connotations it had always had,</page><page sequence="21">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 21 was gaining recognition as a legitimate form of worship, albeit primarily in philosophically influenced circles. This new trend com- bined in ancient Judaism and early Christianity with other (partly biblical) motives which facilitated the acceptance of this relatively uncommon phenomenon, but it lasted till the early Middle Ages until it had become accepted in the Church at large, probably because the ancient suspicions surrounding this phenomenon did not easily disappear.

Howell, A Commentary on Book One of the Epigrams of Martial, London 1980, 190: "The Greeks and Romans believed that, if a prayer was to be heard by the gods, it had to be spoken with the lips. So if a person wished to utter a prayer which he did not wish others to hear, he had to whisper it". Cf. also Per- sius, Sat. II 3-4: "non tu prece poscis emaci quae nisi seductis nequeas committere divis", with the scholion ad loc.: ideo palam non orant, ne iniqua eorum petitio audiatur. 20 See also the scholion ad locum [quoted in Schmidt, Veteres philosophi 55-6]: Laverna ... est dea furum et simulacrum eius fures colunt, et qui consilia sua volunt tacita; nam preces eius cum silentio exercentur. 21 Cf.

Appel, De Romanorum precationibus (RGVV 7,2), Giessen 1909, 210: tacitus is not always = mutus. Thus also Wagenvoort, Orare, precari 201. On the other hand, however, murmur can apparently designate audible speech, see e.g. Firmicus Maternus, De errore 22,1: Tunc a sacerdote omnium qui flebant fauces unguentur,</page><page sequence="23">Silent Prayer in Antiquity 23 quibus perunctis sacerdos hoc lento murmure susurrat: 0oppsEiz [6a=ot o5 Osoi5 asaSa[.Lvou / e"tt y&amp;p ?ijLtv ix lr6vcv awslpteo. Here the Greek words indicate the content of the murmur. 23 See ad locum F. B6mer, P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphosen VI-VII, Heidelberg 1976, 268. 24 In a very similar scene in Propertius, Elegies IV 1, 99-102, the mss. read in line 101 the intractable sentence Iunonis facite (or facito) votum impetrabile dixi. Sudhaus, Lautes und leises Beten 186-187, proposed the brilliant emendation tacite, which yields: "In silence I made a vow to Juno that prevailed with her", so that the woman could give birth, but modern editors and commentators of Pro- pertius have overlooked or unduly neglected this emendation. 25 Cf. ibid. 366-7: "Then Circe turned to prayers and incantations and unknown chants to worship unknown gods". 26 On the lowest form of Hecate, namely in the Underworld, see S.H. Braund, Lucan, Cicil War, Oxford 1992, 285. See also Phars. V 104 "No wicked prayers are uttered there in silent whisper (tacito susurro)". 27 Cf. Met. I 3 magico susurramine. 28 On this passage see A. Abt, Die Apologie des Apuleius von Madaura und die antike Zauberei (RGVV 4,2), Giegen 1908, 286 [212]. 29 More passages are mentioned by Schmidt, Veteres philosophi 61-65. See e.g. Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica VII 488-489: "With silent spells she had swayed him and inspired long since in him a passion to answer hers" (tacitis nam cantibus illum/ flexerat et simili iamdudum adflarat amore). And the Codex Theodosianus IX 38,6 (from 381 CE) stipulates that no amnesty may be given to those "who made poisons sought from noxious herbs and murmured over with incantations in dread secrecy". 30 J. Bidez &amp; F. Cumont, Les mages helliniskes. Zoroastre, Ostands et Hystaspe d'apres la tradition grecque, 2 vols., Paris 1938, II 285-6, quote this passage. For another Christian picture of a magus, but in a negative sense, see Passio apostolorum Petri et Pauli 8 (p. 229 Lipsius-Bonnet): Simon [Magus] ... incantare atque inmurmurare dira carmina coepit. 31 See e.g. Herodotus I 47,3, where the Pythia says in the name of Apollo xo)go5 auvlm.Lt xaci o3 c oveuvroq &amp;xow. Cf. Seneca, De Benef II 1,4: "If men had to make their vows to the gods openly, they would be more sparing of them; so true is it that even to the gods, to whom we most rightly make supplication, we would prefer to pray in silence and in the secrecy of our hearts" (vota homines parcius facerent si palam facienda essent; adeo etiam deos, quibus honestissime sup- plicamus, tacite malumus et intra nosmet ipsos precari). The latter passage seems to imply that by the first century CE in some philosophical circles at least silent prayer was beginning to be more and more acceptable. I doubt Wagenvoort's interpretation of Ovid, Fasti VI 251 in prece totus eram, 'I was entirely absorbed in prayer': "Nowhere that I know in the whole of Latin literature before Christian times could we find another example of a man thus riveted in prayer. Nor can it possibly be that Ovid means he prayed aloud (oravit). A man riveted in prayer was certainly silent" (H. Wagenvoort, Orare, precari 208). This is probably too much of a Christian interpretation. 32 See R. Mortley, From Word to Silence II. The Way of Negation, Christian and Greek, Bonn 1986. 33 But see also already Numenius ap. Eusebius, PE XI 22,1, where this second century CE Middle Platonist clearly states that contact with the highest deity is impossible if one tries to realize that by means of silencing all senses or corporeal</page><page sequence="24">24 Pieter W. van der Horst activities. Only a mystical silence is fitting; the passage is noted by G. Mensching, Das heilige Schweigen (RGVV 20,2), Giegen 1926, 22. See also O. Casel, De philosophorum graecorum silentio mystico (RGVV 16,2), Giessen 1919. 34 In Praep. Evang. IV 13,1 Eusebius quotes from Apollonius' Ispi OuaLCtv the following sentence: [t6vq b 8,pw.o pbq ocu-rbv octi t- xpeStrovt ,X60, 6y F .

In that case already Apollonius would have been its advocate, which is not unthinkable, but the historical Apollonius seems to have conformed to traditional prayer prac- tice (see G. Petzke, Die Traditionen iiber Apollonius von Tyana und das Neue Testament, Leiden 1970, 212-213) and it is uncertain whether Eusebius had direct access to Apollonius' treatise (see E. Norden, Agnostos Theos, Darmstadt 1956 (= 1923), 39- 40 and 343-6). On this passage see further K. Schneider, Die schweigenden Gitter. Eine Studie zur Gottesvorstellung des religidsen Platonismus, Hildesheim 1966, 68-69. 35 This sentence is also found as no. 427 in the so-called Sentences of Sextus; see H. Chadwick's edition (Cambridge 1959) ad locum, p. 180. 36 Cf.

Hamman, Das Gebet in der Alten Kirche, Bern etc. 1989, offers as no. 48 a prayer on papyrus from the third century, which he regards as a Christian prayer. Hamman, however, overlooked the fact that the text of this prayer is identical to Corp. Herm. I 31! 38 See A.-J. Festugiere, La revilation d'Hermis Trismigiste IV, Paris 1954, 76-7 (70-7 is a paragraph titled Dieu est incomprdhensible, indefinissable, indicible). A very striking ancient Egyptian parallel (Instruction of Any 4) to the Hermetic ideas about silent worship is adduced by G. Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes, Cambridge 1986, 70 (who owes it to J.-P. Mahe, Hermis en Haut-Egypte II, Quebec 1982). 39 R. Mortley, From Word to Silence, 2 vols, Bonn 1986, II 251: "To say that God is unknowable, incomprehensible, unspeakable, seems to constitute an approach which will perfectly well accommodate the call to silence"; although he adds that "the way of silence is a far more radical renunciation of language than is the via negativa" (252). 40 See R. Mortley, From Word to Silence I 122-4: the centrality of silence in the Gnostics. 41 See further the numerous references in F. Siegert, Nag-Hammadi-Register, Tiubingen 1982, 300; also the Index in the first edition of The Nag Hammadi Library in English, ed. J.M. Robinson, New Yor etc. 1977, 490 s.v. Silence (note that in the second edition, San Francisco-Leiden 1988, this Index is missing!). Very useful also is the index s.v. of B. Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures, New York 1987, 509.

Holtzmann, Berakot (Die Mischna I 1), Giessen 1912, 56. 46 For Talmud Jerushalmi passage (e.g. Ber. IV 7a) I refer to Billerbeck's Kom- mentar zum NT IV 1, 231-2. 47 In Midrash Psalms CXIX 2 we find the other motive, namely fear that enemies will hear the prayers. I. Elbogen, Derjiidische Gottesdienst in seiner geschichtlichen Ent- wicklung, Hildesheim 1967 (= Frankfurt 1931), 73, argued that the individual prayers offered in a prostrate position in the temple after the incense offering were silent ones, a very doubtful thesis also supported by J.

Montefiore, Rabbinic Literature and Gospel Teachings, New York 1970 (= 1930), 116: "Jesus did not mean more than a warning against ostentation and publicity. He did not want to limit private prayer to the house". 50 See e.g. G.F. Moore, Judaism in the First Three Centuries of the Christian Era I, Cambridge MA 1927, 368-374. 51 On Clement and silence see Mortley, From Word to Silence II 36ff. 52 This is the somewhat oldfashioned translation by M.R. James in his The Apocryphal New Testament, Oxford 1924, 335. The text, in both the Greek and Latin version, is in R.A. Lipsius &amp; M. Bonnet, Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha I, Darmstadt 1959 (= Leipzig 1891), 96-99. The passage is referred to in A. Hamman, La priere chr&amp;tienne et la priere paienne: formes et differences, ANRWII 23,2 (1980) 1226-7. 53 This is the oracle reported by Herodotus I 47 (see above note 31). Ter- tullian's text runs as follows: (3) sono etiam vocis subiectos oportet, aut quantis arteriis opus est, si pro sono audiamur! Deus autem non vocis sed cordis auditor est, sicut conspector. (4) Daemonium oraculi Pythii 'Et mutum', inquit, 'intellego et non loquentem exaudio'. Dei aures sonum expectant? Quomodo ergo oratio Ionae de imo ventre ceti ... ad caelum potuit evadere? 54 Cyprian on Hanna: (5) ... quae Deum non clamosa petitione sed tacite et modeste ... precabatur, ... loquebatur non voce sed corde, quia sic Dominum sciebat audire. 55 My attention was drawn to this passage by the short note of M. Slusser, Reading silently in antiquity, JBL 111 (1992) 499. 56 This interpretation is corroborated by Cassian, Institutio II 10,3. 57 See also O.
