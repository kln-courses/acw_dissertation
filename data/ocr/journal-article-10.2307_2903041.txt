<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Lament and the Rhetoric of the Sublime LINDA M. AUSTIN ]rN English pastoral elegies we often hear intermittent sighs and cries of woe. They may consist of repetitive statements of loss, as in Francois Villon's famous "Ouf sont les neiges," or they may be onomato- poeic exclamations. Such cries-which I will call elements of lamentation, for reasons that should emerge below-disrupt the Greek epics and tragedies as well. Lamentation veers away from the cognitive and the pictorial toward sound. It does not approach a "literary imitation of the visual," the modus operandi of the meditative, philosophical, and imagist tradition in lyric poetry; instead, lamentation evokes "a voice crying" by formu- lating, as much as a linguistic medium can, the noise of trauma.1 Margaret Alexiou has shown us the history of the ritual lament in ancient Greece,2 but in modern history lamentation has no generic line. So although ancient laments in elegiac me- ter were sung to the aulis, no exclusive meter of lamentation exists. In written lyrics the title "lament" has been given to mourning cast in various forms: for instance, Robert Fergus- son's comic laments in Old Town dialect for various Edinburgh figures exhibit many features of the elegy; Thomas Hardy's "Lament" in his elegiac Poems of 1 9 1 2-I13 does not differ gener- ically from the other pieces in the series; and Shelley's "Ado- ? iqq8 by The Regents of the University of California I Hugh Kenner, "The Experience of the Eye: Marianne Moore's Tradition," South- ern Review, n.s. 1 (1965), 760. 2 See TheRitualLament in Greek Tradition (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

To identify the features of lamentation before marking its historical emersions, we have to go back to the brief periods of intense mourning within larger works, such as those in the Book ofJob and the Iliad. These "insets" of lamentation are au- ditory and gestural, and their topoi are exclamations of ineffa- bility and the ubi sunt, often together. As the ubi sunt catalogs losses, the ineffability (or inexpressibility) topos inscribes our confrontation with the idea of death and absence.3 Both may register shock and grief through a language of trauma. The rhetoric of such traumatic expression is ancient; Lon- ginus first described it in his treatise on the sublime. In the sec- ond half of the eighteenth century, when to critics and philoso- phers the sublime became not just elevated language or a particular landscape but a moment of terror and an imagina- tive event, some writers explored the dramatic possibilities of lamentation in the form of the lyric. In 1821 Shelley wrote 'A Lament," a short mourning piece in sublime rhetoric. Inter- est in the uses of this rhetoric persisted-in Richard Harris Barham's "Epigram" (published 1847), and, as I shall suggest, even later. In Shelley's 'A Lament and Barham's "Epigram" merge some of the most popular and influential currents in philosophy and art; they are enactments of the sublime that reflect con- temporary theatrical conventions. Yet both poems are tucked into spare places of today's anthologies and are seldom dis- cussed. This is in part because, as performances, they are espe- cially vulnerable to the dangers that have dogged sublime ex- pression since antiquity; Longinus warned that "attempts to reach beyond" the sublime could "run aground on tawdriness and affectation."4 With these hazards in mind, I shall argue that a rhetoric of lamentation surfaced at the turn of the eigh- 3 The ubi sunt is characteristic of medieval laments. The topos of ineffability or in- expressibility has been discussed widely as a defining feature in the response to death. See, for example, W. David Shaw, Elegy and Paradox: Testing the Conventions (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1994), p. 5. 4 Longinus, On Great Writing (On the Sublime), trans.

A(2D Lamentation that expresses the shock of death has an ancient name, gdos, which referred originally to the kinswoman's shrill cry for the dead.5 In the Greek epics the artless g'os differs from penthos (collective public grief for the death of a hero) and from threnos (the lamentation sung by professional mourners during the wake). Go'os is not kommos, the lament exchanged between chorus and actors in Greek tragedy, but individual lamentation; 6 in Homeric rituals it des- ignates the spoken lament of intimate mourners. The words of the godos are not polished or musical, as is the threnos; goos en- velops the mourner in a private confrontation with the fact of death, with its ineffability. It refers to the actual words of lamen- tation, rather than to the ritual itself or the emotion. The epic can quote the gdos, though frequently it presents it as spectacle rather than sound. Thus the three friends of Job, seeing his misery, lift up their voices and eyes and weep; each tears his mantle and sprinkles dust on his head (Job 2: 11-12). These actions suggest that in an episode or moment of the utmost shock-whether of awe or of grief-language is less expressive than the body. Indeed, the words and phrases of lamentation often wind round in endless repetition or break off. They do no more than point toward some unreachable sorrow. G6os comprises gestures, both physical and linguistic. For instance, Bion's "Lament for Adonis," like Moschus's "Lament for Bion," is a repetitive and protracted statement of woe: I weep for Adonis; lovely Adonis is dead. Dead is lovely Adonis; the Loves join in weeping. Sleep no more, Cypris, amid crimson 5 SeeAlexiou, pp. 13, 102-3. 6 These distinctions are examined in Gregory Nagy, The Best of the Achaeans: Concepts of the Hero in Archaic Greek Poetry (Baltimore:Johns Hopkins Univ.

Awake, wretched goddess, and in sable robe smite thy bosom and say to all, "Lovely Adonis is dead."7 Similarly, the contrapuntal movement of the lamentation in Euripides's The Daughters of Troy overwhelms the coherence of individual speeches. In performance, single lines of Andro- mache and Hecuba may be heard simultaneously, or they may echo each other in a haunting and disengaged stichomythia: ANDROMACHE. Achaeans our masters to bondage are haling me HECUBA. Woe! ANDROMACHE. Why doest thou chant my paean of misery- HECUBA. Alas!- ANDROMACHE. For my burden of woe,- HECUBA. 0 Zeus! ANDROMACHE.

ANDROMACHE. Woe!-8 Pose and movement are evident in Greek as well as in biblical lamentation. In one of the many scenes of mourning from the Iliad, Andromache's words over the body of Hector amplify the horror of loss but also represent the posture of lamentation: "the folk wail for him throughout the city, and grief unspeakable and sorrow hast thou brought upon thy parents, Hector; and for me beyond all others shall grievous woes be left. For at thy death thou didst neither stretch out thy hands to me from thy bed, nor speak to me any word of wisdom whereon I might have pon- dered night and day with shedding of tears."9 In the above passages expression is truncated, repetitive, and recursive.

Sentences rephrase sorrow; words may be descriptive or, more simply, exclamatory, but always they return to the scene of death or the utterance of grief. The words of the gdos obviously are not unintelligible sounds, but they approach onomatopoeisis; the wailing in The Daughters of Troy comes closest. Phrases have the quality of gestures: one hears, in the lament, inchoate cries; one sees the semaphores of in- effability-hand-wringing and wailing. In the epics the goos is an auditory effusion complemented with images- of mourners weeping, flailing their arms, cover- ing their faces, rolling in dirt. In later odes and lyrics, insets of lamentation echo the biblical and classical laments: "But 0 the heavy change, now thou art gone, / Now thou art gone, and never must return!" from "Lycidas" (1637) conveys the ele- mental "O" of trauma as it circulates the repetitive phrases of epic grief.10 Similarly, early lines in Shelley's "Adonais" para- phrase Bion's "Lament for Adonis." In both "Lycidas" and "Ado- nais" the physical gestures of grief are missing, of course, yet they may be suggested by some of the phrases themselves. The griever's "Ah woe is me!" in "Adonais" (1. 154) is a performative phrase that conjures the spectacle of the body in an agony of mourning." One hears and in effect sees, in verbal sound and semaphore, the grief of the survivor. By "performative" I mean a rhetoric that is gestural, that suggests or refers the reader to physical movement. When Shel- ley wrote "Adonais," the line 'Ah woe is me" evoked a spectacle of the tragic figure in an attitude of lamentation, an attitude that was inscribed not only in the epics and lyrics of antiquity but also in the stage directions for drama on both the "legiti- mate" and the "illegitimate" stage. In England the tragedy and historical spectacle that had been the glory of the Elizabethan theater endured well into the nineteenth century. Indeed, to many contemporary and modern commentators, the poetic 10 John Milton, "Lycidas," in Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed. Merritt Y.

But as some of these critics also acknowledge, this drama provided acting vehicles for some of the great early-nineteenth-century tragedians like Edmund Kean and, later, Charlotte Cushman.12 The melodramas that filled the illegitimate theaters like- wise had borrowed their lofty expression from eighteenth- century classical tragedy and its characteristic inflection, ges- tures, and movement. The language of melodrama was inflated, its physical action broad and unnatural. In melodramatic deliv- ery, emphasis fell on numerous words and syllables, and facial expression was exaggerated-the body and face had to express unbridled emotion. Generally, however, melodrama was a more robust form than tragedy. Whereas a long descriptive speech often locked the body of the tragic actor in a static pose on cen- ter stage, the stage directions of melodrama stimulated perpet- ual motion: the actor was walking, gesturing with her or his hands, contorting her or his face.'3 Anyone who reads one of these old melodramas-Edward Fitzball's burletta The Inchcape Bell (1 828), for example, or the sensation novels that inherited their theatricality, like Collins's The Woman in White (1859- 6o)-notices the frenetic energy of the entire stage business. When Shelley wrote "Adonais" in 1821, broad and em- phatic acting had been in vogue on the illegitimate stage for at least thirty years. In light of Shelley's own dramatic composi- tions, his use of performative words and phrases in "Adonais" is not surprising. 'Ah woe is me" echoes both the "Ay me" from "Lycidas" (1. 56) and the lamentation from antiquity. But be- cause Shelley, with other poets, was imagining the dramatic di- mensions of the lyric at a time when, as Allardyce Nicoll re- 12 The influence of Romantics like Byron, Shelley, Baillie, and Coleridge on the- atrical drama is generally thought to have been ruinous. The very long speeches were resistant to staging, but a splendid performance often could bring to life some of the shorter, elliptical (and seemingly incoherent) passages.

(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969-76), I, 6-8, 18. 13 For the differences between eighteenth-century tragedies and the new melodra- mas, see Booth, English Plays, I, 2 1, 2 7.

Like other poems of the genre, it works through lamentation. In a psychoanalytical reading of mourning language, the loss of a loved one forces grievers to recognize their own deaths, a glimpse that is often quickly covered by the obverse triumph of survival contained in the mourner's efforts to grasp reality. Repeating "You're dead," "Thyrsis is dead," and "now thou art dead" conveniently em- beds "I'm alive." 15 Heard amid these echoes, the "Ah woe is me" of "Adonais" efficiently performs the selfish and social func- tions of mourning. Thus lamentation fulfills an important ther- apeutic role despite its apparent meaninglessness. In general, the gdos occurs early in the pastoral, academic, or funeral elegy. It is traumatic language, as we say now: it sounds spontaneous and involuntary; it is meant to exhibit a mind and body temporarily out of control. Traumatic language signals internal dissociation, a state in which events are regis- tered but not understood. The condition, as well as its sympto- matic language, is unsustainable; it does not seem able to sub- sist apart from belated accounts of it, from a point of cognitive recovery.'6 By itself, then, the phrase of woe expresses an internal movement that is not necessarily therapeutic. It is a dramatic topos, and the mourner who cries "Woe is me" has literally dis- appeared into her or his grief. The mourner is now a mere per- 14 Allardyce Nicoll, A History of English Drama, i660-i900, 6 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

Sacks notes the role of traumatic lamentation in "the crucial self-privileging of the survivors" (The En- glish Elegy: Studies in the Genrefrom Spenser to Yeats [Baltimore:Johns Hopkins Univ.

In its histor- ical context, then, "Ah woe is me" echoes ritualistic lamentation from the epics and from an immediate source, melodrama. By the 1 82os it had become the theater of trauma, specializing in the response to the sublime moment. The ancient rhetoric of lamentation was absorbed into grand movements of melodrama as a result of a culmination of trends in late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth- century philosophy and medicine. It was the similarity between the mental motion of the sublime (as Kant and Burke imag- ined it) and some forms of insanity (as the medical literature pictured them) that exposed the ancient, ceremonial rhetoric of lamentation to an internal view. In this view, the death of an- other forces the mourner to foresee his own inevitable death, a terrifying idea that plunges him into self-obliterating shock, mixed with the grief of actual loss. For Dennis, Blair, Burke, Kant, and all of their commen- tators, as well as for eighteenth-century seekers of the pictur- esque, the occasion of the sublime is death, in the guise of some supernatural or supersensible power that stimulates instincts of self-preservation. It appears as a premonition of the subject's own death, a vision of natural destruction, a loss. The Roman- tic sublime, beginning with Burke's 1759 account, no longer focused on rhetoric or the stock sources of the experience that John Dennis listed in his famous essay The Grounds of Criticism in Poetry (1704); instead it concentrates on the imagination or the emotions during the encounter with death. Death epito- mizes Kant's idea of the sublime, that "absolutely great" thing that stretches the imagination of the survivor to its limits.17 With Burke and Kant the sublime ceases to be simply a phe- nomenon and becomes a movement in time, during which the imagination moves to an emotional extreme. Kant in 1 790 calls this movement "vibration," an "alternating attraction toward, 17 See Immanuel Kant, Critique ofJudgment (1790), trans. J. H. Bernard (New York: Hafner Press, 1951), p. 96.</page><page sequence="9">THE LAMENT AND THE SUBLIME 287 and repulsion from, the same object" (p. 97)-namely death, in one of its manifestations. Burke imagined the sublime as a "mind ... hurried out of itself, by a croud of great and confused images." 18 The idea of the sublime expressed by Kant and Burke co- incides with contemporary medical conceptions of mental dissolution. The physician and philosopher Johann Christian Heinroth, adapting seventeenth- and eighteenth-century hy- drodynamical theories of the body, pictured melancholia and a state like the sublime as opposite internal movements. In his Textbook of Disturbances of Mental Life ( 1 8 1 8) Heinroth conceives of mental disorders in terms of excess or deficient energy, which he classifies as "exaltations" (hyperstheniae) or "depressions" (as- theniae). These first two orders encompass insanity and melan- cholia, respectively. (In the third order were mixed distur- bances [hyperastheniae].) The idea of an object threatening the cohesion of the subject is prominent in Heinroth's descriptions of the first two states.19 In melancholia Heinroth detects "a ten- dency to lose oneself in one central point and thus gradually fade out into nothing" (I, 222). For him the sense of losing oneself in the idee fixe (a dominating passion) is a crucial ele- ment of melancholia, "for the life of the patient revolves around the one object which has enslaved the disposition, so that this object is an idee fixe of the patient, who keeps thinking about it and is drawn to it as though by the force of gravity" (I, 1 9 1). In- sanity (ecstasis) corresponds to contemporary versions of the sublime moment: in this state of exaltation, he writes, a mind with no anchoring object tends "to expand without limit and thus also fade out into nothing." An unreflective disposition, exaltation produces "the bliss of self-oblivion" (1, 292929-23) .2O As Hugh Blair mentions in his 1783 essay on the sub- ject, the sublime "is an emotion which can never be long pro- "I Edmund Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of ourIdeas of the Sublime and Beautiful, ed.

Sighs, repetition, and onomatopoeia discharge the momentary effects of the sur- vivors' terror before the prospect of death. This traumatic sub- lime, juxtaposed with the medical picture of severe melancho- lia (what we now call "depression"), seems to have strayed far from its classical identity as noble expression. The grand style was a controlled effect engineered by a great writer. (Nicolas Boileau says of Longinus, "Souvent il fait la figure qu'il enseigne; et en parlant du Sublime, il est lui- mesme tres-sublime.") 23 Yet Longinus, as Michel Deguy reminds us, "treats not the relation between rhetoric and persuasion but the relation between the 'stupefying' (Oavccda-tov [thauma- sion]) and 'ecstasy' ('KcrTacns" [ekstasis] ) ."24 In fact, lamenta- tion that emulates the psychic movement of the Romantic sub- lime signifies this event in grammatical and tropic disorders that reproduce some of the rhetorical features of the grand style that Longinus describes. In the middle chapters of his treatise he discusses devices that carry the "true stamp of living passion" (p. 33). Disconnected, halting utterance without con- junctions (asyndeton), signaling agitation or surprise; accumu- lating figures (anaphora and polyptoton); apostrophe; verbal condensation; and syntactical inversions (hyperbaton) can each suggest "in the right place" the sublime frenzy (p. 1 1). There are, then, more than coincidental similarities be- tween expressions of sublimity and grief. When the speaker mourns a loss (real or imagined), her rhetoric conveys aphasia, 21 "The Sublime in Writing," in his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, ed. Harold F. Harding, 2 vols.

Paratactical lines (asyndeton), inversions, and great imag- istic condensation, in addition to ejaculations and lapses in grammar, all compose a relatively nonvisual and nonconcep- tual speech, the senseless sound of shock in the sublime and lamentation. In the panic of sudden dissolution- toward a cen- trifugal nothing or into a centripetal abyss of the idee fixe- lamentation records what nosologies since the turn of the century have termed a manic-depression that can be "exalted" or "retarded," close correlates of Heinroth's hyperstheniae and astheniae.25 Lamentation enacts the hysterics and paralysis of woe through aposiopesis, the movement toward silence. We hear it, paradoxically, in refrains, ellipses, and outbursts. Both emo- tional states-sublimity and grief-surface in an identical pos- ture because each represents a momentary but profound dis- composure. That rhetorical marvel "woe is me," declaring the total self-absorption of the mourner, personifies the speaker as woe-her individuality is utterly erased in this theatrical iden- tification. Such dissolution may, following the old mechanical images of the organism, be centrifugal and centripetal: thus language may be driven to the limit, as John Sallis imagines in his treatment of the sublime.26 Following the grand style, it may evaporate into ellipses; or, rather than trailing off, it may repeat 25 Emil Kraepelin's sixth edition of Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie (1899) first combined all of the various manic and melancholic disorders into one disease, manic-depressive in- sanity. In its maniacal form the illness was characterized by "psychomotor excitement"; depressive states were marked by varying degrees of "psychomotor retardation" (quoted in Stanley W. Jackson, Melancholia and Depression: From Hippocratic Times to Modern Times [New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1986], p. 191). For the survival of the term "melancho- lia" into the twentieth century, see Jackson's account of the debate over the existence of "involutional melancholia" (pp. 207-1 1) and the discussion of the classification of de- pression (pp. 211-19).

Elements of the grand style, the basis of noble expression, now serve as traumatic utterance. The formulations of Boileau, Dennis, and Burke origi- nated in a picture of a body that was unsettled, transported in ecstasy or sunk in melancholia. In his Salon de 1767 Diderot records his view of a mountain lake in conventionalized ges- tures of the sublime effect: 'J'etais immobile, mes regards er- raient sans s'arreter sur aucun objet, mes bras tombaient a mes cots, j'avais la bouche entre'ouverte." 27 This paralysis is a con- ventional reaction to one of nature's grand scenes, but it also inscribes the instant of helplessness before magnitude and in- finity that the lament too records: 'je ne vous dirai point quelle fut la duree de mon enchantement; l'immobilite des etres, la solitude d'un lieu, son silence profond suspend le temps, il n'y en a plus, rien ne le mesure, l'homme devient comme eternel" (pp. 134-35) .28 Likewise, in its frequent stage directions call- ing for arms extended above the head or stretched forward, for postures suggesting supplication or agony, the melodrama ex- hibited subjects in the throes of sublime moments. Having tem- porarily lost the power of words, they must, like one of the char- acters in William Dimond's The Foundling of the Forest (1 809), "gesticulate [their] transport" (quoted in Booth, English Melo- drama, p. 9go). The many dumb characters in these plays (like the foundling in The Inchcape Bell), who were called to strike some of the more immoderate postures, suggest the inverse re- lation between speechlessness and feeling in melodrama. These images of the body and face in grief or in the throes of "elevation," 'joy," and "grandeur" were all stock gestures of the actor's art and had been inventoried in manuals like The Thespian Preceptor ( 1 8 1 1) .29 In 1 8o6 the physician Sir Charles Bell offered a medical basis for classified gestures of the body- 27 Denis Diderot, Salons, ed.Jean Seznec, 2d ed., 3 vols.

His Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting focuses on semaphores of the sublime: ec- stasy, terror, shock, grief, and deep melancholia. Based on his observation that human beings have "organs" solely for expres- sion, he concludes that the countenance of man, unlike that of animals, "is an index of the mind, having expression corre- sponding with each emotion of the soul."30 In Bell's repertory of physical dispositions, grief belongs with "the distraction of doubt, the effort to comprehend, and a sense of supernatural and resistless power, [and] produce [s] one of the most pecu- liar ... states of which the human frame is susceptible," a tens- ing of the muscles (pp. 109-10). From Job and the classical epics we recognize this description as the trauma of grief and incomprehension, an unsettling sense of being overwhelmed. On the contrary, Bell writes, "languor, faintness, and sorrow" relax the muscles to effect "the depressing of the angle of the mouth" (p. 113). We observe in the sorrowful countenance signs of meditative melancholy. Grief and sorrow were anatomically opposite to Bell, but he noticed combinations of them in visual and verbal descrip- tions of lamentation. For example, in the figure of Constance he observes the "unnatural mixture of the tumult and violence of grief with the contemplative recollections of sorrow." Having been cast adrift in a rudderless boat for the second time, Con- stance raises her hands to the heavens, sinks to her knees, and wails a g'os before fainting. It is grief, writes Bell, "which makes her tear her hair, defy all counsel and redress, and call on death or madness as her sole relief." Yet all the while, her face, turned toward her dead son, shows melancholy, the "calmness of spirit which can stop to recollect" (pp. 1 14-15).31 In this coupling of excited posture and absorbed visage, which he calls 30 Charles Bell, Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, i8o6), p. 88. 3 Bell must be referring to John Gower's version of the story of Constance in the Confessio Amantis (1390), in which Constance grieves and swoons before composing herself in order to comfort and suckle her child (see The Complete Works ofJohn Gower, ed.

If we recall Diderot, mo- tionless and agape before the landscapes of Joseph Vernet, we can now see the same affinities between exaltation and depres- sion, between sublime transport and melancholic absorption: "ma voix coupee, mes idees confondues, je restai stupefait et muet" (Salons, III, 133) .32 Like Heinroth's hyperastheniae, the opposites are merged and interpreted broadly through similar gestures. Late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century medicine and philosophy offered, then, an internal picture of the com- motion behind the bursts, clogs, and fragments of the sublime gIos. Both Heinroth's ideas of mental disturbances and the Ro- mantic sublime visualized internal motion; descriptions like Diderot's of the sublime attitude imagine this turbulence erupt- ing in gestures. The moment of shock, whether recorded and described as in Diderot's Salon or performed, suggests sublime aposiopesis. Words become inadequate or unavailable. In this sense, as recent studies have noted, the performative "seems to span the polarities of . . . the extroversion of the actor, the intro- version of the signifier."33 Incoherent or inchoate displays of grief not only violate Longinus's demand that the sublime provide "reflections which reach beyond what was said," but, if prolonged, they often sink to bathos, thus confirming the paradox of the ancient treatise (p. 1o). For in bathos the prescriptive rhetoric doubles as the list of "defects" that impede sublimity. In section 3 of On Great Writing agitated rhythms and short syllables-all gusts of "the frenzied spirit"(p. 1 i) -become "hollow and artificial swell- ings" (p. 6). Sinking (bathos) and sublimity can in this light come confusingly close. In his illuminating study of eighteenth- century painting Michael Fried records Diderot's distaste for 32 "My speech cut off, my ideas disconcerted, I was left stupefied and mute" (my translation). 33 Andrew Parker and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, introduction to Performativity and Per- formance, ed.

And by the nineteenth century the sublime reaction had become so codified and con- nected to melodrama that its rhetoric was in peril of sinking. The wedding of a philosophical-medical picture of internal dissolution to Longinian rhetoric invited a rereading of the ancient ceremonial g'os. Lamentation presents nothing, asJean-Luc Nancy says of the sublime; it moves toward an abyss of language (speechlessness); it is overwhelmed with the idea of loss, rather than with the lost object.35 The particu- lar image is no longer coherent, so the focus is the terror of loss itself. When writers attempted to create a sublime lyric separate from the epics and elegies, they based it on inexpressibility and gesture, the dramatic topoi of lamentation. This lyric was the- atrical, not poetical; its models were from contemporary melo- drama rather than from the Elizabethan stage. Comparing Shelley's 'A Lament" of 1821 (published in 1824) and Richard Harris Barham's "Epigram" (published in 1 847) with Wordsworth's "A slumber did my spirit seal" ( 799) and Hardy's "During Wind and Rain" (1 917), we see that each can be read as a dramatic expression of the response to the sublime. Each confronts rather than contemplates the ineffa- bility of loss or of death; each looks and sounds broken and unfinished; the ubi sunt motif operates implicitly through all. Shelley's and Barham's poems, which I shall discuss in more de- tail than the others, are performative pieces. In Shelley's poem the rhetorical question "When will re- turn" in the first stanza is followed by a refrain, the g'os: "No 34 Michael Fried, Absorption and Theatricality: Painting and Beholder in the Age of Diderot (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univ. of California Press, 1980), p. 97; see Diderot, III, 1 1 2. 35 See Jean-Luc Nancy, "The Sublime Offering," in Of the Sublime, p. 53.</page><page sequence="16">294 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE more -Oh, never more!" As the poem conveys the sound of wailing and woe, it gushes toward sublimity: O World! 0 life! 0 time! On whose last steps I climb, Trembling at that where I had stood before; When will return the glory of your prime? No more Oh, never more! (Complete Works, IV, 96-97; 11. 1-5) The lines exemplify the extroversion of acting and the introver- sion of meaning: ejaculations and dashes demand the emphases and heavy pauses that typified the delivery of contemporary tragedians.36 The poem's images and semantics, meanwhile, are dim. The theme of the lyric-presumably lost time-emerges through linguistic gesture: the deictic "at that where" conjures the hand-wringing of lamentation; "at that" points toward a place the poet can define only as "where [he] had stood before." Trembling "at" the sight of the "before" now lost to him, the poet grasps at several abstractions ("world," "life," "time") in order to define his position. Stanza II presents dead figures of time and loss in discrete sets. Like those of stanza I, these too are canceled by the wail of "No more": Out of the day and night Ajoy has taken flight: Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar, Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight No more -Oh, never more! (11. 6-io) Deixis and the desultory figures for youth and time together deflect the lyric's force into a series of rushed and broken ejac- ulations, the elements of sublime expression. Inversions in lines 8-9 raise for a moment the chiasmic force of pleasure, before the refrain interrupts and cancels all delight. The fluidity of lamentation in the elegy-emulating the mourner's tears-is 36 Booth mentions William Macready in English Melodrama, p. 207.</page><page sequence="17">THE LAMENT AND THE SUBLIME 295 here checked by such hyperbaton, as well as by verbal compres- sion and exclamation.37 The result is effusion and contraction, both obscuring vision. The awkward "a joy"- rather than "my joy"- suggests a dissociation blocking any memory of an object of happiness. In light of Shelley's work in dramatic form, which culmi- nated in The Cenci (1 8 1 9), we can easily view "A Lament" as his attempt to write a g'os through a theatrical medium. The piece is too short and elliptical to belong to the corpus of poetical and abstract tragedies for which the Romantics were known; it appears instead to require the spectacle of melodrama. This impression is strengthened by the Bodleian manuscript of the poem, which reveals that Shelley's interest while composing the piece lay in its delivery. Under stanza "I" Shelley has written "Le toit etait [sic] formt' des etoiles errantes, et de foudre, entre lesquelles on voyait des [space] enflammes. [space] le demuere [sic] brulant comme le feu, froide comme le glace [sic] .38 Shelley is testing images in order to describe the emotions at their limits. Accordingly, we might rephrase his sentence with Heinroth's extremes in mind: beneath a terrible fate we live passionately ("brulant comme le feu") and paralyzed ("froid comme le glace"). Joining traditional rhetorical and physical postures, the images convey the ecstasis of sublime shock and the stupefaction of melancholia, opposite yet visually indistin- guishable, as in Bell's anatomy of grief-since, as Heinroth writes, "only the nature of the pull is different" (I, 223). Below the two stanzas of the lament in Shelley's Bodleian manuscript is the cadenced sentence, "When the mournful surges ring the shipwrecked seaman's knell" (pp. 4-5). This balanced line, un- derscoring the aural basis of the entire composition, offers a measured, dirgelike sound of lamentation, which Shelley re- jected for the shrill cry. 37 Esther Schor makes this point about the late-eighteenth-century elegy in Bearing the Dead: The British Culture of Mourning from the Enlightenment to Victoria (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1994), p. 51. 38 Percy Bysshe Shelley, Bodleian MS. Shelley adds. d. 7: A Facsimile Edition with Full Transcription and Textual Notes, ed.

In The Cenci, Shelley's most theatrical drama, the convention is the bodily expression of speechless- ness. Cenci declares, "And yet I need not speak," but he goes on to impress silence on the air and the pavement: "0, thou most silent air, that shalt not hear / What now I think!" (quoted in Nicoll, IV, 197). As the notations accompanying the manu- script of "A Lament" show, however, Shelley knew that mute- ness required a truncated, un-Elizabethan utterance, and he conceived of this lyric in sound and rhythm rather than in im- ages or semantics. 'A Lament" is an exercise in the sublime ef- fect and tragic acting. It suggests that Shelley's interest in drama extended beyond the poetic to the melodramatic. Whereas in 'A Lament" Shelley composed a tragic speech, Barham in his "Epigram" educes the presence of the melodra- matic actor. Barham, known from the l840s on as Thomas In- goldsby, the author of The Ingoldsby Legends, employs the stock theme of sublime expression, death and lost time. Like Shel- ley's poem, Barham's employs a rhetoric of exaltation, but while Shelley gestures toward the sublime ether through deixis, Bar- ham expresses the ineffability of loss through another perfor- mative technique, citation: What Horace says is- Eheufugaces Anni labuntur, Postume! Postume! Years glide away, and are lost to me, lost to me! Now, when the folks in the dance sport their merry toes, Taglionis and Ellslers, Duvernays and Ceritos, Sighing I murmur, "O mihi praeteritos! " 39 Like personification, imitation of the great masters of rheto- ric-here in a Horatian ode-is a mainstay of elevated lan- guage. Longinus observed this in his treatise: "even those little inclined to inspiration become possessed by the greatness of 39 [Richard Harris Barham], TheIngoldsby Legends, orMirth and Marvels, ed. R.

Lane, Richard Harris Barham (Columbia: Univ. of Missouri Press, 1967), pp. 164, 177.</page><page sequence="19">THE LAMENT AND THE SUBLIME 297 others" (p. 22) .40 As an efficient and secure way to achieve sub- limity, Barham recites Horace's words, translates them into English, and then repeats one line in the original Latin, calling attention to the act of recitation. Barham makes "Epigram" his piece, rather than Horace's, by embedding directions for delivery. The speaker is to sigh and murmur his last phrase; he is to separate the syllables of "postume" and enunciate "lost to me" in order to stress the rhyme. Other marks for emphasis and intonation (exclama- tions, "Now") guide the performance. The dash in the first line signals the speaker to pause before reciting the lines of the an- cient. The pause (one of the trademarks of Macready's style during the actor's tenure at Covent Garden [1837-39]) im- presses listeners with the depth of the character's feeling.4' Pro- nunciation of separate syllables, gulps and interjections, em- phasis on single words, and pauses all were standard practices of melodramatic delivery. No doubt "Epigram," like 'A Lament," was conceived as a performance: as the poet speaks of the sublime, he was to be sublime. Auden, in fact, includes Barham's lines in his 1938 an- thology of "light verse," poetry that he defined in part as per- formative.42 Both poems revive the ceremonial lamentation of the ancients through a contemporary medium, melodrama. As vers de socie&amp;4 Barham's poem conveys the ubi sunt of lamenta- tion not just by using Horace's words but by dropping the names of famous dancers. For although the poem, like Shel- ley's, laments lost time through grand verbal gestures, it has a particular object of mourning: the loss of bodily vigor. Thus the ballerinas of line 6 are like the epic heroes, the glorious physical specimens over whose corpses the Greeks marvel and 40 Suzanne Guerlac argues that citation "appears to be embedded in the very oper- ation of sublimity" ("Longinus and the Subject of the Sublime," New Literary History, 16 [1985], 276). 41 See Booth, English Plays of the Nineteenth Century, I, 3; and English Melodrama, p. 207. 42 See W.

In Barham's piece they are not slain but rather over- taken by the parallel, stronger movement of the years, whose inexorable gliding wastes away all bodies. In referring to dance Barham offers a visual complement to the elegiac tone of Horace's lines. For by 1 847, the date that "Epigram" appeared in the Third Series of The Ingoldsby Leg- ends, the names of the dancers belonged to the recent but re- ceding golden age of Romantic ballet. Only the career of Fanny Cerrito was still flourishing: Marie Taglioni, the oldest of the ballerinas, had given her farewell performance in 1 844; Pauline Duvernay had been retired for ten years after dancing many of Taglioni's roles in Drury Lane in the early thirties; and Fanny Elssler, Taglioni's rival, had been at the height of her fame in the late thirties and early forties. Thus the names become in- corporated into lamentation's ubi sunt, its catalog of losses. Al- most all of the dancers have vanished from the stage -Taglioni was the first; Cerrito the latest. The ethereal body of the Ro- mantic ballet is already buried here, in the dancers' names. Barham's use of ballet covers a theatrical, as well as an ele- giac, aspect of the sublime. If he had indeed seen all four of the women whom he names perform (and all had had London en- gagements during the 83os and 1840s), then he had witnessed great changes in the technique and staging of ballet. Of the four, Elssler was probably the most traditional dancer, noted for her "mime" work in the ballet daction, a cousin of melo- drama. But the others had become famous for their roles in "white ballets" like Giselle and La Sylphide. Marie Taglioni was the mistress of this "Romantic" ballet, a form that, like melo- drama, filled the stage with ghosts and goblins. (In fact, William Moncrieff based his 1841 melodrama Giselle; or, The Phantom Night Dancers on the French ballet.) The white ballets staged the internal picture of the sublime through an aerial technique (ballon) that freed the classical body. The immobile torso re- laxed; and pointe work, formerly a discrete series of momentary poses, began to articulate the fluid movements of the whole form. Taglioni transformed ballet from an execution of dis- crete pirouettes and entrechats to dances performed, it was said, on "the tips of her toes"; she was usually drawn with abnormally</page><page sequence="21">THE LAMENT AND THE SUBLIME 299 tiny feet performing her signature role in La Sylphide.43 Cerrito, ten years younger than Taglioni, rivaled her in ballon as La Syl- phide. A tiny, athletic dancer known for her high leaps and ex- tensions, Cerrito could bound and fly all over the stage; the choreographer Jules Perrot created another white ballet, On- dine, especially for her in 1 843 (the same year she danced a pas de deux with the majestic Elssler before Queen Victoria) 44 Even Elssler's technique, which in its emphasis on mime reverted to the classical style, combined pointe work with a flexuous upper body-a modern union. When Barham introduces these names as "folks," he uses the current term for the gypsies, peasants, and above all, ap- paritions of the white ballet-the cast of effervescent and rarefied creatures that Theophile Gautier described as "shades dissolved into mist."45 In the 1830s the dance, through these elemental beings, had come to epitomize sublimity of move- ment. Ballet gave physical expression, that is, to the internal motion of the sublime -its headlong rush to the limits of imag- ination, its temporary elision of the subject. Thus Taglioni's seemingly natural movements altered the spectacle of ballet: in his tribute to the dancer's final performance in 1844, Gautier wrote that, after La Sylphide, the Paris Opera "was given over to gnomes, undines, salamanders, elves, nixes, wilis, peris-to all that strange and mysterious folk" (p. 73) . Similarly, Michel Deguy has figured the sublime as "a pineal apex where the body is united with and suspends itself in the soul, a utopia of infinitesimal weightlessness as at the labile peak of the highest leap" (pp. 9-10). Deguy's rhapsodic words transfer to the imag- 43 See Mary Clarke and Clement Crisp, Ballerina: The Art of Women in Classical Ballet (London: BBC Books, 1987), p. 30. 44 See Clarke and Crisp, p. 40. 45 Gautier, "Farewell Performance of Marie Taglioni," rev. of i July 1844, in his The Romantic Ballet, as Seen by Thtophile Gautier: Being His Notices of All the Principal Perfor- mances of Ballet Given at Paris during the Years i83 7-i84 8, trans.

Their movement re- flects the mourner's sense of the motion of his own life, and the sublime dance provides the vehicle of lamentation, in addition to being the object of loss itself. But, as in Shelley's "A Lament," speech and gesture seem artificial and excessive, even for the solemn subject: in the shift from ritual to drama, the sacral char- acter of lament has been lost and replaced by stagecraft. In "Epi- gram" this substitution results in a blatantly comic performance, one that "sends up" the sublimity of ballet and lamentation. In my view, line 5, Barham's single contribution to "Epigram," is a deliberate piece of bathos: "sport their merry toes," a phrase unlike any that the balletomane Gautier used in his reviews of the dance, does not summon the illusion of bodilessness that white ballets created in gauze and tulle; instead, it launches a nonsense pun in Hudibrastic rhyme. Barham enacts a fail- ure of the sublime-a failure, in the Longinian sense, of noble expression -and our performer appears "gesticulat[ing] his transport" over the legendary "cherry toes" ("Ceritos"). In a verbal spoof of ballon, or lightness, the poet burlesques the ec- stasis, the expansion without limit, that the Romantic ballerinas embodied. Romantic ballet's feat was to surmount the melodramatic body, its leaden movements and swelled gestures, in order to achieve a sublimity without words. "Epigram" and "A Lament," in contrast, indicate the extent to which melodramatic acting had become the stylized delivery of tragic and epic expression in the nineteenth century. Melodrama conventionalized ges- tures that had been inscribed in lamentation as far back as the epic gdos at a time when the Romantic sublime made these ges- tures psychologically significant-signs of the inadequacy of all utterance in moments of ecstasy and stupefaction. As both of these poems also illustrate, the lyric did not convey sublime grief in a way that suited the general taste of readers: it de- pended too much on histrionics and on "failures" of noble</page><page sequence="23">THE LAMENT AND THE SUBLIME 301 rhetoric. The obscurity of both Barham's "Epigram" and Shel- ley's "A Lament" is tied to the fate of melodrama itself, now linked solely with the unnatural, inflated language and action of the illegitimate theater. Canonical lyric poetry has advanced a restrained, even cryptic, expression of trauma that conceals passion in images. Consider one of our most cherished lamentations, Words- worth's mysterious "Lucy" poem 'A slumber did my spirit seal" (1799), as an example. Like. Barham's and Shelley's pieces, Wordsworth's is syntactically aphasic, a result of its attempts to express and represent the ineffable-loss and death. Short, dis- junctive lines move the girl away from anthropomorphic lan- guage and move the speaker away from an emotional and co- herent expression. Pairs of paratactic observations convey an insensibility of both speaker and dead object. The effect is frozen, traumatic utterance, an inhibited version of Diderot's physical reaction to the sublime ('J'etais immobile . . . "). Like the impassive "thing" who "neither hears nor sees," this speaker utters a dead language; his words are imprecise.47 The stupefied poet of 'A slumber" represents a similarly passive "Lucy" with- out motion, force, or feeling. "Il n'y en a plus," wrote Diderot of his sublime experience, "l'homme devient comme eternel." Likewise, Lucy becomes part of the diurnal course of nature, but the earth to which she is impervious also lacks vitality: it is but "rocks and stones and trees," a list of detritus with which Lucy is "Rolled round" (11. 8, 7) . So what sounded like ecstasis in Diderot's enthusiastic responses to Vernet's landscapes is here a close linguistic relation; what Sir Charles Bell, anatomizing ex- pression, called the "lethargy of woe." Arguably, Wordsworth's 'A slumber" was also an attempt to dramatize the response to the sublime. Just as the leaden Barham cannot conjure the white ballet and its vision of bodily transcendence but can only repeat names, so the mourner in Wordsworth's lament cannot name the thing that rolls Lucy but can only list elements that have no agent. If we consider "A William Wordsworth, "A slumber did my spirit seal," in "Lyrical Ballads" and Otlwr Poemts, I797-i800, ed. James Butler and Karen Green (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1992), p. 164,11. 3, 6.</page><page sequence="24">302 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE slumber" to be a self-lament in a league with the two short po- ems above (and Wordsworth, Paul de Man says, "is one of the few poets who can write proleptically of their own death") ,48 then we have another way to hear the distraught phrases like "She seemed a thing"-as unsuccessful attempts to describe the ineffable. Language is a corpse because the speaker cannot imagine enough. Shelley's notations in the manuscript copy of "A Lament" well characterize the two kinds of emotional responses to pow- erful intimations of death. Eyes trained on what Hugh Kenner has called the "voiceless" visual poetry (p. 760) of some mod- ernists have been more receptive to the sublime that is "froid comme la glace" than "brulant comme le feu." The lyric is our most personal form of expression, and decades of imagist po- etry have often made it prohibitively private. (This may explain why "A slumber," unlike the other two poems I have discussed, has provoked so many readings, most of them psychological.) The triumph of a visual language of restraint over a gestural language of effusion came with imagist poetry, which projected all emotion onto the object. But just as melodrama survived in stage directions of twentieth-century plays, so the histrionics of passion continued to sound in the lyric.49 Thomas Hardy's "During Wind and Rain" (published in 1917) juxtaposes the two stylized responses to the sublime; the poem reads like a composite of the performative and the imagist. Some lines compress memories and emotions into objects ("Clocks and carpets and chairs / On the lawn all day"; "Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs"). Others, variations on a re- frain, lament the passing of time: in "Ah, no; the years, the 4* Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism, ad ed., rev. (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1983), p. 225. 49 Just how long melodrama prevailed is debatable. Some contend that it disap- peared in the second half of the nineteenth century (between i 86o and i 870). Booth contests this theory with evidence from stage directions of early-twentieth-century plays. He does allow that "certain peculiarities" of acting-judging again from dia- logue and stage directions-became "somewhat" less emphatic as the nineteenth cen- tury aged (see English Melodrama, p. 203) . 50 Thomas Hardy, "During Wind and Rain," in The Complete Poetical Works of Thomas Hardy, ed.

" (1. 6) we again hear the repetitious moaning of the ancient gdos. Because many of us subvocalize while we read, the poem can have a disconcerting effect: lines of gesture and emphasis ("They sing their dearest songs-/ He, she, all of them-yea" [11. 1-2]) elicit from us a mute performance. They signal the body to gesture, the voice to pause and emphasize. For W. David Shaw-as a result, per- haps, of his own delivery- the poem "reaches sublime heights." Shaw does not mean the sublime of classical expression, but rather the sublime of stupefaction and ecstasy: "During Wind and Rain," like the sensations of melodrama, "has the power to chill and ravish readers" (p. 130).51 In his journal of 1762 Edward Gibbon notes: "It is surprizing how much Longinus and Mr. Bourke dif- fer as to their idea of the operations of the sublime in our minds. The one considers it as exalting us with a conscious pride and courage, and the other as astonishing every faculty, and depressing the soul itself with terror and amazement."52 The distinction between the Longinian sublime (the grand style that exalts the subject through self-dramatization) and the Romantic sublime (a response to inconceivable magnitude that dissolves the subject into an inner abyss) is an eighteenth- century discovery. Gibbon continues: "If it should be found that the sublime produces this double, and seemingly contrary effect; we must look out for some more general principles which may account for it" (pp. 1 8o -81 ). The principle is self- annihilating movement-between exaltation and depression in medicine, ecstasy and stupefaction in philosophy. Both the Longinian and the Romantic sublimes are dislo- cations that occur through an overwhelming rush of images or 51 But Shaw does not align sublimity with lamentation. To his ear, "Ah, no, the years 0!" is "buoyant." Because he does not hear the gdos, he has trouble coordinating the images with the refrain, which "seems to pull against the bleak sentiment it appears to express" (p. 129). 52 Gibbons Journal to January 2 8th, 1 763: My Journal, I, II, and III, and Elhemirides, in- tro.

This is the instant in which the mind loses itself. It has been defined as a pathologi- cal moment, and indeed only medicine has attempted to de- scribe a prolonged dissolution, into either insanity or melan- cholia. In philosophical accounts, recovery always occurs. In Kant's dynamic sublime, the vertigo lasts only a moment; then reason resolves it into a conceptual unity-"infinity," "nature." Longinus's rhetorical sublime is likewise a successful confronta- tion, because noble expression itself demonstrates the subject's mastery of imponderables. In this sense even the temporary aphasia characteristic of verbal reactions to sublime experiences is a sign of recovery. Deguy, for example, imagines the sublime of Longinus as "adverse speech snatched from death. . . . Sub- limity at once belongs to the mortal curve and surmounts it, overhangs it tangentially like a remarkable 'turning point"' (p. 9). Here Deguy describes the sublime from the static point of its successful conclusion, much as Kant did. And Neil Hertz, also following Kant, has called the instant "the sublime turn"- "the turning away from near-annihilation, from being 'under death' to being out from under death."53 As philosophy and medicine hurried to close the episode of terror and "adverse speech," the dramatic arts sought to rep- resent it through movements of the body and patterns of lan- guage. English melodrama, remembered now as an overblown imitation of earlier English tragedy, sought to express the sense of verbal insufficiency that interest in the sublime reaction had stimulated. (In this light, the abstract language of German meta- physics may have deprived the English stage of theatrical drama, in Allardyce Nicoll's view, but it also inspired a performative ut- terance and gesture through its dynamic accounts of ecstasis in philosophy and medicine.) 54 If the melodramatic rhetoric of exaltation almost always deflated, as Longinus had warned, then it is partly because our ears and eyes are accustomed to a subtler drama- one of un- 53 "A Reading of Longinus," in his The End of the Line: Essays on Psychoanalysis and the Sublime (New York: Columbia Univ.

We are dis- concerted, moreover, by signs of the performative in the lyric. It should be eloquent even as it confesses its inadequacy, but lamentation sabotages the form by straining beyond linguistic expression. The lament belongs to the arts of gesture, melo- drama, and, most fittingly, dance. Perhaps that is why pieces like Barham's, Shelley's, and Wordsworth's are truncated, why their grammar and syntax seem to occlude a visual field. The poems deflect the impact of the sublime moment to the body, whose gestures complement the nonconceptual, auditory force of the language. One hears at the sublime moment the obdu- rate melancholia of "A slumber did my spirit seal" or the rush and disintegrating ecstasy of Shelley's "A Lament." Barham's and Shelley's lyrics remain unread today because they display an awkward change in signifying practice from the ritual of lamentation to its performance and, finally, to the transcription of that performance. In attempting to translate the spectacle of grief unbound, these poems reinterpret the speech and gestures of ritual through a theatrical form of which the text is but an inadequate script. As WVIad Godzich and Jef- frey Kittay observe, any "movement from performance to text" requires all of a reader's store of "cultural competence"9 to "mit- igate" the effects of loss and excess.55 In "A Lament" and "Epi- gram" these effects are exaggerated, for as transcriptions of ancient rituals and melodrama these poems are doubly re- moved-first from the sacral, then from the theatrical space. Because of the difficulties they present for the modern reader, the poems may only reinforce currently acceptable boundaries of transcribed grief. Hence lamentation, through its excesses and losses, helps define the "elegy." Trauma and depression-real depression, which, Julia Kristeva remarks, "speak[s] of nothing"-lie be- yond our notion of the lyrical, which comes always from the point of linguistic mastery.56 So, for example, whereas the rit- See The Emergence of Prose: An Essay in Prosaics (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1987),p.( 6. 56 Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia, trans.

It is through meditation and ritual that the elegy has become an in- stitution in the service of the common weal. As an institution the elegy is, in Dominick LaCapra's words, a "normative" mode of "'binding' with variable relations to more ecstatic, sublime, or uncanny modes of 'unbinding."'57 In contrast, lamentation enacts the sublime moment of un- binding, and early-nineteenth-century drama-however codi- fied it now looks-performs that moment. Imagine Romantic lamentation as the rhetorical bridge between two parallel con- ceptions of movement in philosophy and medicine at the turn of the last century. The restless and gesticulating lyrics of Shel- ley and Barham are efforts to dramatize the ancient gdos in light of these new ideas. That they were written with recourse to the performative arts suggests an effort to extend the lyric to the portrayal of violent sensations, sensations that had found their supreme expression in the emerging arts of the body-melo- drama and the Romantic ballet.
