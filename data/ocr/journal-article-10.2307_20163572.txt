<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recognizing Venus (I): Aeneas Meets His Mother KENNETH RECKFORD In Memoriam John Petersen Elder I Disguise and Revelation A begin with a sensuous impression, and a disturbing one. After Venus, disguised as a virgin huntress, meets Aeneas in the woods of Carthage; after she tells him about Dido, hears his complaint, and comforts and reassures him, much as Jupiter reas sured her earlier, and sends him on his way, she turns to depart, and only then reveals herself as his goddess-mother: Dixit, et avertens rosea cervice refulsit, ambrosiaeque comae divinum v?rtice odorem spiravere; pedes vest?s defluxit ad imos, et vera incessu patuit dea. (Aen. 1.402-5) How sensuous these verses are. Do they really mean what (naively, impressionistically) I think they mean? How should they be translated? What professors normally read?what is certainly the more fit ting and proper reading?may be seen from a sampling of good English translations.1 Here, in prose, is David West: When she had finished speaking and was turning away, her neck shone with a rosy light and her hair breathed the divine odour of ambrosia. Her dress flowed free to her feet and as she walked he knew she was truly a goddess. And in verse, Robert Fitzgerald: On this she turned away. Rose-pink and fair Her nape shone, her ambrosial hair exhaled Divine perfume, her gown rippled full length, And by her stride she showed herself a goddess.</page><page sequence="2">2 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER And finally, C. Day Lewis's version, first of Venus's appearance in disguise, and then of her departure and self-revelation: Then, from the heart of the woodland, his mother came to meet him Guised as a maiden in face and dress, with a girl's weapons? A Spartan girl, as it might be, or Thracian Harpalyce, Outpacer of horses, swift outrunner of running rivers. In huntress wise she had handily slung her bow from her shoulder, And her hair was free to blow in the wind, and she went bare-kneed With the folding flows of her dress kilted up and securely knotted. She spoke first:? Hullo there, young men! She spoke. She turned away; and as she turned, her neck Glowed to a rose-flush, her crown of ambrosial hair breathed out A heavenly fragrance, her robe flowed down, down to her feet, And in gait she was all a goddess. We are meant, evidently, to contrast the carelessly unbound, free-falling hair of the "huntress maid" with the implicitly restored, elegant hairdo of the goddess Venus; and, as commenta tors have pointed out, beginning with Servius, the folds of Venus's garment that were tucked up for ease (allegedly) in riding and hunting now fall, graceful and dignified, to her feet.2 Now she walks gracefully, as a goddess should.3 She can take her place, when she wishes, among the respectable Olympian ladies. The glory of her divinity separates her altogether from mere suffering mortals like Dido, or like her son Aeneas, whose frustration breaks out anew at her sudden departure:4 "Why play these unfeeling games? Why can't we join hands and talk honestly, face to face?" Not only Juno is "cruel," or the other gods, or fate. Aeneas is right. That lighthearted game of disguise and decep tion, that impossibility of genuine emotional contact between mother and son, is bad enough; but there is more. There is, here</page><page sequence="3">Kenneth Reckford 3 and now, Venus's overwhelming erotic appeal as (in that other naive, impressionable reading that I have heretofore kept undis closed?not least, in order to discover if it is freely shared by at least a few readers of Arion) her clothing slips down to her feet, and she is naked.5 It is an overwhelming moment. Can my (admittedly subjective) impression carry conviction? Can Virgil have imagined, let alone intended, any such reading? Is there any reasonable evidence to support it? And if the answer is Yes, how will this alter our larger reading of the Aeneid} Mine is not, to be sure, a respectable sub-reading: but neither is the Greek Aphrodite (as she underlies the civic-minded, very Roman Venus Genetrix) an altogether respectable goddess. In Iliad 5 she is wounded and mocked when (to protect Aeneas!) she ventures into battle. In her own sphere, however, she is all-power ful. When, in Iliad 3, she approaches Helen in the guise of an old spinning-woman, to stir her desire and bring her to Paris's fragrant bedchamber, Helen recognizes the goddess by the deep-felt power of her underlying beauty and sensuality: She knew the goddess, then, by her very beautiful neck, her desire-bearing breasts, and her bright-flashing eyes, and wondered then, and spoke, calling her by name... . (//. 3.396-8) Helen rebels valiantly, or tries to rebel. She struggles against her own externalized shamelessness, against the absolute indecency of her coming, once more, to Paris's coward bed. But Aphrodite, from without and also from within, beats down all resistance. It is?for Helen, for Troy, for all who try to reassert their own responsibility in the face of overwhelming historical and psycho logical pressures?a tragic scene. This same Homeric Aphrodite, I argue, can and should some times be recognized beneath the more respectable Venus Genetrix of the Aeneid, mother of Aeneas, ancestor and patroness of the gens lulia and the Roman race. That same "very beautiful neck" reappears in the rosy light of her epiphany in Aeneid 1. The "desire-bearing breasts" were not, I think, altogether concealed by her huntress disguise earlier: but I shall not now attempt to sup port one already suspect impression by reference to another. Nor would I challenge the orthodox reading, of Venus's robe slipping down to full length. That is, overtly, the reading Virgil</page><page sequence="4">4 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER intended (and if many old-fashioned philologists will consider my approach hopelessly subjective, most modern literary theorists, by compensation, will think my concern with what Virgil intended, or might probably have intended, hopelessly naive). I am only arguing for what Lyne calls a "further voice." It is like a trompe Voeil effect: we may have it both ways. Yes, Venus's robe falls to its full length?what the respectable goddess will wear in public; and yes, too, her clothing slips, or flows down to her feet, leaving her erotically on display. I had expected originally to find support for my reading of Aeneid 1.404-5 in the Roman male elegists, whose Cynthias and Corinnas sometimes disrobe for their real and/or imaginary pleas ure.6 What I found instead was a passage in Catullus 64, a poem that Virgil knew well and often cited.7 Ariadne stands on the shore of Naxos, gazing after the now distant sails of her departed lover Theseus: namque fluentisono prospectans litore Diae, Thesea cedentem c?leri cum classe tuetur ind?mitos in corde gerens Ariadne furores, necdum etiam sese quae visit visere credit, utpote fallaci quae turn primum excita somno desertam in sola miseram se cern?t harena. immemor at iuvenis fugiens pellit vada remis, irrita ventosae linquens promissa procellae. quern procul ex alga maestis Minois ocellis, saxea ut effigies bacchantis, prospicit, eheu, prospicit et magnis curarum fluctu?t undis, non flavo retinens subtilem v?rtice mitram, non contecta levi velatum pectus amictu, non tereti strophio lactentis vi?eta papillas, omnia quae toto delapsa corpore passim ipsius ante pedes fluctus salis alludebant. sed ?eque turn mitrae neque turn fluitantis amictus ilia vicem curans toto ex te pectore, Theseu, toto animo, tota pendebat perdita mente. (52-70) For, gazing outward from Dia's wave-beaten, sounding shore, she looks on Theseus departing with his swift ships: Ariadne looks, and bears uncontrolled madness in her heart?not even believing that she is seeing what</page><page sequence="5">Kenneth Reckford 5 she is seeing?as one who, just now awakened from treacherous sleep, finds herself there on the shore, deserted, alone, and wretched. The unmindful youth hastens away, striking the sea with oars, and letting the winds carry his broken promises away; and Minos's daughter, sad-eyed, from the weedy shore looks after him, and floats on powerful waves of care: her delicate headdress not held upon her golden hair; her bosom not concealed with its light covering; the tips of her milky breasts not now restrained by a slender band: for all these things slipped down from her entire body, and the salt waves made sport with them, lapping at her feet. But she had no thought to spare for her headdress or floating clothes. All she cared for was you, Theseus. Heart, mind, and soul, she clung altogether to you. From Ariadne's clothing slipping carelessly off her body, for the waves to play with before her feet, to Venus's garment flowing down to her feet, takes only a short step of the poetic imagination. Let me dwell briefly on clothing and nakedness in Catullus 64 before returning to Virgil's borrowings, anticipated in the itali cized words and phrases.8 In Catullus's very Hellenistic and Roman "epyllion," Ariadne's story?her desertion by Theseus, her desolation and lament, The seus's continuing unmindfulness (which results also in his father's death), and her joyful rescue by the god Bacchus, who will marry her?is inset into the larger story of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Among the many contrasts and connections between the two tales is the powerful Catullan motif of seeing and not seeing.9 The poem begins in wonder and delight, as the Nereids emerge from the sea to look with wonder on the Argo, and as mortals in turn gaze with delight on the sea-nymphs, seen naked from the waist up. Peleus's almost archetypal "male gaze" inflames him with love of Thetis, and the gods grant him the joy of love and marriage fulfilled, the highest joy, as Pindar says, to which mortals can attain. On the coverlet, by contrast, love turns blind. Theseus departs, forgetful; Ariadne's eyes close in sleep, while her lover departs; and, waking, she gazes in wild confusion after his distant sails. Aegeus, gazing in turn, and not seeing the white sails of life and hope, will drown himself in the sea. But the coverlet that rep resents these scenes will in turn become an object of the eager, almost erotic gaze (cupide spectando) of the mortal wedding</page><page sequence="6">6 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I) : AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER guests before they give way to the divinities. Thus sorrow yields to joy in a double movement from desolation to marriage; and joy reverts to sorrow again toward the poem's end, in the prophecy of Achilles' warfare and death, and in the narrator's reflections on his own harsh times, when the gods have distanced themselves irrevo cably from sinful mortals. In his careful analysis of the first Ariadne scene, Klingner argued that Catullus carefully avoided using any erotic motifs that would have detracted from the dignity and pathos of the abandon ment.10 The god Bacchus, who will rescue Ariadne, is not por trayed as observing her lament, and thereby reassuring us, if not her, of the non-tragic ending; nor does his wild entourage here come upon her sleeping, partly uncovered form?the "male gaze" again, more frankly pornographic this time?to report to their master the wonder they have seen. Catullus's Ariadne is not offered up as a passive sexual victim, whether for a divine husband or for the voyeuristic delectation of male onlookers within or without the larger story. Klingner is surely right about Catullus's artistic concentration on the immediate, unrelieved tragic scene of Ariadne's abandon ment, desolation, and despair. Yet an erotic element remains, as Ariadne stands, rather than sleeps, and her clothing slips from her body in careless abandon, leaving her half-naked or, as I rather think, naked by the sea:11 and she projects an unconscious erotic appeal that is more poignant, bordering on the tragic, than porno graphic. She is ready, certainly (as it appears in retrospect, or in the reader's half-formed expectation) for Bacchus to come and rescue her. But we also have a feeling that all this erotic beauty and attrac tiveness is being wasted on the seashore air. It is like the final scene in Chopin's The Awakening, when Edna strips off her ugly, uncomfortable bathing costume, an icon of society's disheartening restraints and inhibitions, to plunge once more, and finally, into the sea of erotic sensuality, which must now become also the sea of death. For Ariadne, too, at the moment of despair caught in Catullus's lens and held steadily before our eyes, eros will be con summated in death. Returning now to Virgil, we remember how much he draws on Ariadne's lament for Dido's passionate reproaches to Aeneas in Book 4, and how the good Aeneas is cast, perhaps unfairly, in the role of the faithless, "unmindful" (immemor) Theseus. In several ways, Venus's appearance to Aeneas in Book 1 prepares both hero</page><page sequence="7">Kenneth Reckford 7 and reader for the encounter with Dido, and for her tragedy. I shall return to this often discussed point. For now, I am still concerned with Venus's sensuality, which seems here, from almost every viewpoint, altogether out of place?so much so, that scholars have quite denied, or else repressed the very idea of, its existence12?but which, I believe, draws on Ariadne's, and is overwhelmingly present. Let me try, then, to amend a passage of E. L. Harrison in which she argues, with admirable clarity and force, against what she regards as de la Ville de Mir mont's wrongheaded explanation of Venus's disguise: His idea is that Virgil disguised Venus for modesty's sake; it would have been inappropriate for the lascivious goddess of Cyprus, as he calls her, to reveal herself to her son in the voluptuous nudity with which people tend to associate her. But this overlooks the fact that by Virgil's day the poet, no less than the painter and the sculptor, had available to him a variety of Venus types whose characteristics he could select and emphasize according to his own immediate require ments. She could indeed be the sensuous love-goddess who appears on the wall-paintings of Pompeii and elsewhere; but she could also be the stately goddess who figures on other Pompeian wall-paintings as the protectress of that city, or the one who, during the closing decades of the Republic, assumed such importance at Rome as the Venus Felix of Sulla, the Venus Victrix of Pompey, and above all the Venus Genetrix of Julius Caesar and Octavian, mother of the gens Iulia and ancestress of the Roman race. And in fact, when Venus turns to go and reveals her true identity, Virgil blends features of these various Venus-types. Initially there is a sen sual quality about the goddess's beauty and fragrance that recalls the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite. . . . But the volup tuousness is restrained and the goddess's sexuality mini mized, the result being quite consistent with dignified majesty. And it is certainly this last quality that the poet goes on to impart to Venus as he concludes the description of her departure. For the dress which up to now has been tucked up over her knees is suddenly loosened and flows down to her feet to lend a matronly gravity to the goddess as she takes her leave.. . .</page><page sequence="8">8 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER This Venus, Harrison concludes, "could easily have appeared undisguised from the start without causing the least embar rassment" to Aeneas, or to anyone else.13 I agree: this is how it ought to be. Virgil presents us here, as Harrison argues, and as Wlosok did before her, with an impres sively Roman goddess whose agenda largely (but not entirely) coincides with the public business of Rome and Fate, to which Aeneas's private life and feelings are regularly sacrificed. And yet: just as Virgil's Juno retains a great deal too much of the Homeric Hera, implacably hostile to the Trojans, all of whom she would "eat raw" if she had a chance, so too, beneath Venus's newfound Roman respectability and "matronly gravity" there is still a great deal too much of the laughter-loving, irresponsible, and sexually overpowering Aphrodite who was recognized by Helen in Iliad 3, and who (to anticipate my later argument) seduced the cattle herding Anchises in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite?the prod uct of that seduction being Aeneas himself. Aeneas's bafflement and irritation following Venus's self-reve lation have often been noted. I want only to add an erotic element, of not quite "restrained voluptuousness," and of a sexuality so considerable that, even when "minimized" (if that is the right word), it is still disturbing. I shall also argue that this evidently unconcealable maternal sexuality adds significantly to the frustra tion and confusion that the good Aeneas has to carry throughout Virgil's poem. This is not to downplay Venus's very considerable help, advice, and encouragement to Aeneas, which matter enormously, and which must certainly be weighed against his personal loneliness, disappointment, and frustration. I shall review both the help and the frustration in my next section, against their Homeric back ground, especially in Odyssey 6-8 and 13. After that, I shall return to the Hymn to Aphrodite; and finally, I shall sketch out some pos sible implications of "Venus as seductive mother" for Aeneas's psychology, for Dido's tragedy, and also for the latter, "Iliadic" half of the Aeneid. II Play-Acting and Deceptive Help It is (taking it as it comes, not anticipating the tragic sequel) a beautiful intervention. Although Aeneas does not summon his</page><page sequence="9">Kenneth Reckford 9 divine mother, as Achilles summons Thetis, to hear his complaint, but rather encourages his shipwrecked followers to persevere, sto ically suppressing his own pain and discouragement, Venus brings his needs proactively to Jupiter, who smiles on her, and calms her, and reassures her about Aeneas's future success and that of his descendants. Although Jupiter's reaffirmation of this promised destiny leaves little room for Aeneas's personal happiness, for the quiet, ease, and comfort that his mother wished for him (as any loving mother would), and although she probably failed to grasp Jupiter's fuller implications, that history is built on human labor and self-sacrifice, and only through harsh wars may one arrive finally at a pax Augusta14?still, as Stahl has pointed out, Venus is reassured more by the tone of Jupiter's revelation to her than by its specific content, and she quickly and happily passes on this reas surance to her son.15 Disguising herself as a huntress maiden, she meets Aeneas in the unknown woods of Carthage, tells him Dido's story, cuts short his complaint ("I was doing my job, but every thing went wrong . . ."), and tells him that his men and ships have (mostly) survived, the omens are good, and he should proceed where his way leads. At which, revealing herself and shedding a protective cloud around Aeneas, she departs for lovely Paphos. In all this activity, Venus plays the part, inherited by Virgil from Naevius and Ennius, of Aeneas's patron goddess who "shows the way" (matre dea monstrante viam, 1.382)16?all the more, because she is now seen as the special ancestress of the gens Iulia, culminating in Augustus, as well as the Romans generally as Aeneidae. She also models this part against an Homeric backdrop, of Thetis's interventions for Achilles and Athena's for Odysseus. What is new and disturbing in Aeneid 1 is Venus's play-acting. It could be a scene from Roman comedy.17 Venus disguises herself as a huntress maiden; she virtually plays Diana, her opposite; and she makes the most of the freedom and fun that this imposture pro vides, "Hey, guys!" she calls out, in the tone and diction of com edy, "Have you seen any of my sisters around?" And again, to Aeneas: "Whoever you are (quisqu?s es ), the gods must be looking after you." It is true, of course; the gods are looking after Aeneas, as Venus well knows?which is why she is in high good humor. Yet we cannot, like a Plautine audience, take pleasure in the ongo ing foolery of Sic Venus et Vener is contra sic filius or sus (325: "So Venus spoke, and Venus's son answered her."). The game has gone too far. It is not harmless play like the swans' capering described</page><page sequence="10">10 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER earlier (ludunt, 397), for Aeneas can be hurt. He is called to the tragic, not comic stage; as a participant, not (yet) a detached observer. The cruelty of Venus's playfulness, and Cupid's, was a truism. Horace imagines her joining ill-suited persons in love, in her "savage fun": saevo mittere cum ioco (Odes 1.33, 12). It is Venus again, "savage mother of sweet Cupids" (mater saeva Cupidinum), who makes Horace fall head over heels in love with a beautiful boy when age and decorum bid him retire from the erotic fray. Her irresponsible fooling around, as love-goddess, with Horace's personal life and feelings in Odes 4.1 balances the more impersonal, Roman conclusion of Odes 4.15, where Horace joins in the general celebration of Augustus's new age of peace and prosperity, raising a glass to "Troy, Anchises, and the offspring of nurturing Venus," almae Veneris. The love-goddess who is Rome's patron seems, like Book 4 itself, to bridge the private and public worlds. A reassuring thought. But the reconciliation, for Horace, is only momentary, caught in a flash of ever-shifting lyric perception; and for Virgil, in the Aeneid, it is finally unfeasible. For Venus's play turns savage when it comes to Dido, whose tragedy we anticipate even during this happy scene. Anxious once more about Juno's interference and the dangers of Carthage, Venus will intervene again to bind Dido with fatal bonds of pas sion, using deception and disguise: for Cupid, impersonating lulus, will breathe uncontrolled passion into the unsuspecting queen. So too, Venus will laugh, "all tricks discovered," in Book 4, after she outmaneuvers Juno and connives at a "marriage union" that she knows cannot last.18 In the comparable scene in Apolloni us's Argonautica, Hera is the society lady of slightly higher status who, even while asking a favor?to make Medea fall in love with Jason?teases Aphrodite about her difficulties with her irrespon sible boy. The love-affair, though difficult, will lead to genuine marriage; the Argonautica (if we stop there) has a happy ending. Not so Aeneid 1-4, where love's passion will destroy Dido, and where "the good Aeneas" will be cast in the intolerable role of a betrayer, like Euripides' Jason, or like the "mindless" (immemor) Theseus in Catullus 64. But all this is to come. What Aeneas senses immediately, and protests against, is Venus's cruel game with himself: Ule ubi matrem agnovit tali fugientem est voce secutus:</page><page sequence="11">Kenneth Reckford 11 'quid natum totiens, crudelis tu quoque, falsis ludis imaginibus? cur dextrae iungere dextram non datur ac veras audire et reddere voces?' talibus incusat gressumque ad moenia tendit. (1.405-10) After he recognized his mother, as she was hastening away, he pursued her with these words: "Why fool your son so many times with false images? You too are cruel. Why can't we join hands? Why can't we exchange honest talk? Why isn't that allowed?" So he reproached her, and moved towards the walls. His words pick up, not just the play (ludere) of those returning swans, but the cruel murder of Sychaeus (crudelis aras) and the vil lain's cruel deception of his sister afterwards, multa malus simulans vana spe lusit amantem, (1.352) The villain fooled her often, in her love, with false pretenses of hope, until Sychaeus's ghost (imago) appeared to Dido in a dream and revealed all.19 Aeneas apprehends something of that same cruel, manipulative "play" in Venus's game with himself, in which she first pretended to be someone else and then, revealing herself finally as goddess and mother, ran away. The reproach is heartfelt. This hide-and-seek business has happened, we may imagine, many times before. But Aeneas is a Stoic and Roman hero, and he pro ceeds on his way towards Carthage town and Dido as, following suggestively in Odysseus's epic footsteps, he was told to do. Indeed, the strangeness of Venus's treatment of her son in Aeneid 1 emerges most clearly against the Homeric background of Odyssey 6-8: where Athena stirs Nausica? to actions by which she will find and help Odysseus; where, disguised as a charming young girl with a pitcher, she directs Odysseus to the town and palace; and where, again disguised, she further supports Odysseus, enhancing his grace and prestige among the duly impressed, increasingly well-disposed Phaeacians. It is a nice success story, culminating in Odysseus's return home to Ithaca. Aeneas's recov ery movement is comparable, from being shipwrecked and lost in an unknown country, to receiving Venus's advice and encourage</page><page sequence="12">12 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER ment, exploring a new, civilized town, meeting Dido, and receiv ing her generous hospitality; all this follows the Homeric pattern closely, as Knauer has shown;20 but where it will lead is quite another matter. Venus plays Athena here, and Nausica? too, whom Homer lik ens in stature and beauty to Artemis among her nymphs. Odys seus, too, in supplicating her, asks whether she is divine or mortal; if she is a goddess, she most resembles Artemis in form, height, and general appearance; but the rest of his compliments are addressed to the mortal maiden she almost certainly is. In another story, evidently, she would have married the fascinating stranger; many signs point to such an outcome; but Odysseus already has a wife and home, and Nausica?, in Book 8, blesses his homecoming, asking only that he not forget her help?as clearly he won't. He has enjoyed a hint of romance, without any unpleasant complica tions for himself or for anybody else. And Aeneas? He will find complications enough among his new, hospitable, luxury-loving "Phaeacians"; there will be no blessing when he departs. But first, there is his mother, playing a mortal maiden like Nausica?. He asks, how to address her: o quam te memorem, virgo? He is (unlike Odysseus) almost certain that she is a goddess, not a mortal; her countenance and tone seem, despite appearances, to proclaim her divinity (and heroes are not easily fooled); so he asks for her advice and help, promising "Many victims will fall before your altars." She insists, without actually lying, that she is mortal: Punic maidens dress like this, purple boots (coturno) and all.21 Still, he instinctively addresses her as a goddess, o dea ; and he complains to her about his disasters and his unrewarded pietas as one might complain to one's mother?as Achilles, indeed, complained to Thetis in the Iliad. Venus inter rupts, encourages him, and departs. It was, as he might have guessed, his own goddess-mother all along. We follow him as (in the Latin) he recognizes first the goddess, and then the departing mother: pedes vestis defluxit ad imos et vera incessu patuit dea. Ule ubi matrem agnovit tali fugientem est voce secutus:. . . (1.404-6) The hint of romance earlier?of finding oneself momentarily within a happy folktale, like Odysseus?adds strangely to the</page><page sequence="13">Kenneth Reckford 13 erotic confusion of Aeneas's meeting with his beautiful, playful, and seductive mother. But although Virgil's chief structural model for Aeneid 1 was Odyssey 6-8, we can appreciate Aeneas's frustration still better against the background of Odysseus's meeting with Athena in Odyssey 13, after the Phaeacian sailors deposit him, sleeping, on the shore of Ithaca, his homeland. Recall the sequence of events: (1) Athena casts a mist about Odysseus, so he won't be recog nized before he takes revenge on the suitors. (There is real danger here, whereas on Scheria, there was only the risk of unpleasant ness.) Everything looks foreign to Odysseus, and he grieves. (2) Athena comes near, in the form of a shepherd lad holding a javelin. He beseeches her, as he would a god, to tell him what land this is. After a teasing interval, she tells him that it is Ithaca, a land famous "as far as Troy." (3) Although Odysseus might have revealed himself upon that cue, he tells a long "Cretan" story, the first of many. Now Athena smiles, strokes him, and appears as a tall, beautiful woman?an image, presumably, of her "real" identity. She enjoys him, she says; they have a similar love of guile, in which he is pre-eminent among mortals and she among gods: "You didn't recognize Pallas Athena, Zeus's daughter, who always stands by you and protects you amid all your toils ... and came here now so that I might fabri cate plots with you. ..." (4) Yet Odysseus complains. It is hard to recognize the goddess among her many changes. What he does know is that she stood by him at Troy, but was gone afterwards, until she met him in Sche ria. Is this, now, another trick? Once again, Athena praises his ready intelligence: "That's why I can't abandon you in your trou bles." Earlier, she wouldn't fight with Poseidon; but now, she will show him the face of Ithaca. She scatters the mist; she conceals his treasures in the "misty cave"; and they sit together, goddess and mortal, by the sacred olive tree and plan destruction for the suitors. She will stand by him in this struggle, too. Finally, she disguises him as an old beggar, so he can reconnoiter and, in time, win back his home. Now Virgil indicates, though with his usual indirection, that Venus has watched over Aeneas even more consistently than Athena watched over Odysseus, her special favorite. Troubling differences yet remain. In the first place, Venus has not welcomed Aeneas home; indeed, the many cumulative allusions to Odyssey</page><page sequence="14">14 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER 13 remind us insistently of the distance from "Ithaca" to Carthage (and from Carthage to Rome). In the second place, the relations of goddess and mortal have become more opaque. Aeneas is honest and straightforward, as Odysseus was not, but Venus maintains to the last her Odyssean dissimulation. "We come from Troy," he says; you may have heard of it; I am pius Aeneas."11 Yes, she has heard of Troy: the comedy is strong. She hears out his complaint; she reassures him that the gods care for him, and all shall be well; and we are meant, as observers, to enjoy the comic irony, as Venus enacts what she describes (rather as Athena, in Odyssey 3, dis guised as old Mentor, prayed to Poseidon to grant good fortune to Nestor and his people and, as Homer says, "granted the prayer her self"); still, something is badly amiss. Aeneas cannot enjoy, with his own mother, anything like the intimacy and cooperation that Odysseus enjoyed with Athena.23 They cannot join hands, cannot speak to each other in mutual sincerity. It is "not granted" (non datur): but why? There is no answer, only the enfolding mist. And perhaps that protective cloud that Venus, departing, sheds around Aeneas says it best. It is hard to see why Aeneas should need protection, given Mercury's intervention earlier to make the Carthaginians' hearts well-disposed to the Trojan refugees: he is neither Odysseus walking among the suspicious, narrow-minded Phaeacians nor Odysseus returned, more dangerously, to his occu pied homeland. Rather, the cloud well symbolizes what Segal has described as Aeneas's ambiguous position between the godlike (or authorial) observer of events and the confusedly involved partici pant in a world of blind happenings and violent human passions.24 Though eager to break out of the cloud and reestablish physical contact with their friends (coniungere dextras, 1.514), Aeneas and Achates "hide their feelings and watch from cover within the hol low cloud": dissimulant et nube cava speculantur amicti. After the cloud dissolves, Aeneas emerges in glorious, godlike beauty, reenacting something of his mother's epiphany earlier, and bring ing her same seductive power to work upon the susceptible Dido. And yet?unlike Odysseus, for whose sake Athena cleared away the mist, so he might recognize his own country?Aeneas, even upon re-emerging into sunlight, remains himself too a victim of the confusion of things, and an unwitting carrier of deception and betrayal.25 No question about it: he is his mother's son. The description earlier of their encounter ended with Venus's return to Paphos:</page><page sequence="15">Kenneth Reckford 15 ipsa Paphum sublimis abit sedesque revisit laeta suas, ubi templum Uli, centumque Sabaeo ture calent arae sertisque recentibus halant. (1.415-7) She went, high through the air, to Paphus, and returned happily to that peaceful place where her temple stands, where Sabaean incense burns on a hundred altars fragrant with fresh-cut flowers. Here she is happy (laeta): partly because she has helped her son out of troubles, as she believes; and partly because she has escaped from the world of mortal worries (curae) into her own, private, over-the-rainbow world?a world, to be sure, less of Epicurean calm than of luxurious synesthesia. There is also one last Odys sean echo, from the conclusion of Demodocus's tale of Aphrodite and Ares: So she, then, came to Cyprus, laughter-loving Aphrodite, to Paphos, where her sacred precinct is and her fragrant altar: and there the Graces bathed her and anointed her with oil ambrosial, such as gleams upon the ever-living gods, and clothed her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold. (Od. 8.362-6) The allusion is unmistakable, down to small details of diction, word-order, and metrical correspondence.26 We recall the whole unforgettable story, of which so many moralists complained in antiquity, or which they allegorized into safe meaning: the wild comic tale (which balances Demodocus's two other, more painful songs) of Aphrodite's adultery with Ares, and how Hephaestus catches the two lovers and fastens them tight in the very bed of love. He then (the joke is on the self-proclaimed cuckold) calls on the gods to witness his shame; they come, and laugh, and make various remarks, until a settlement is reached and the lovers are released. Then the two "leap up." Ares goes to (warlike) Thrace, Aphrodite to Paphos. What is wonderful is how, after what for ordinary mortals would be utter and complete humiliation, the divine lovers return to their own special worlds, and Aphrodite is bathed, anointed, and reclothed in her own special loveliness, grace, and (yes) dignity. It is, whatever Puritans will say, a wonder fully satisfying conclusion to this story.</page><page sequence="16">16 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER But Virgil's allusion follows a different track, through dignity to sensuality. Venus returns, after play-acting the virgin huntress, to her own special realm of luxe et volupt?. She may already (anticipating this Homeric ending) have been reclothed in divine dignity and grace, but the strong perfume of an all-too-human sex uality is definitely in the air. If we add this culminating impression to the already disturbing eroticism described earlier, of Venus's self-revelation to her son, we may come to realiz? that she has played still another part: not just the maternal Thetis, and the pro tective Athena, and the innocent, helpful Nausica?, but also, the laughter-loving Aphrodite of Homer?and too, of the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where, among other notable touches, the "Paphos" verses significantly recur. Ill Venus, Anchises, and Aeneas The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite tells how Zeus requited the love-goddess's troublemaking and insults by causing her to desire a mortal, the Trojan Anchises, then shepherding on Mount Ida; how she seduced Anchises, pretending to be a mortal maiden; and how, revealing her divine identity, she told him that she would bear a child, Aeneas, whose offspring would flourish through many generations. For all its lightheartedness and humor, the Hymn touches on serious issues of human limit and mortality; for, as Aphrodite shows Anchises through the parabolic stories of Ganymede and Tithonus, he must accept his own mortality, as we must also? though Aphrodite feels shamed and stained by her close encounter with it.27 If Virgil, as I believe, incorporated something of this old, marvelous seduction of Anchises into Venus's meeting with their now-grown son, it may be that his imagination was stirred by the "Homeric" mix of lightness and sorrow, divine playfulness and human vulnerability in the Hymn. I shall concentrate here on the closest points of contact: Aphrodite's dressing-up and disguise; Anchises' undressing of her, prior to lovemaking; and her divine epiphany afterwards. (1) Aphrodite prepares for the seduction by first making her self beautiful:</page><page sequence="17">Kenneth Reckford i7 She went to Kypros, and there she entered her fragrant temple at Paphos (there she has an enclosure and fragrant altar). There she entered within and closed the shining doors. There the Graces bathed her and anointed her with oil immortal, such as clothes the gods who exist forever, immortal, beautiful oil which had been perfumed for her. She dressed herself well, with all fair clothes about her, adorned herself with gold, Aphrodite, lover of smiles, and then she flew toward Troy, leaving fragrant Kypros; high among the clouds and fast she made her way. (58-67, Peter Smith's translation) The Hymn here reproduces and elaborates the three Odyssean verses cited earlier, about Aphrodite's coming to Paphos and being bathed and anointed with fragrant, immortal oil; the immortal fragrance is further described, and the beautiful clothing and jew elry are mentioned, to be elaborated later.28 Although such descriptions have typical epic flavor?being equivalent, as Smith points out, to those of heroes arming for battle?the hearer is allowed to witness what is virtually the goddess's first epiphany here, in that same immortal beauty which she reassumed in Odys sey 8 after the undignified doings in Hephaestus's bed. (2) Aphrodite then travels to Mount Ida, where the wild beasts fawn upon her and couple joyfully (a touch of Noah's Ark, and a reminder of the universal procreative force emanating from, or represented by, Aphrodite); and she disguises herself: She came and stood before him, the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite, in height and form resembling a young unmarried woman that he might not be afraid when he saw her with his eyes. Anchises, seeing her, was struck with thought and wondered at her form and her height, and at her glistening clothes: for the robe she wore shone brighter than the blaze of fire; she had spiralling bracelets as well and shining ear-rings; and about her soft neck, too, most beautiful necklaces lay, fair and of gold, elaborately wrought?like the moon they shone on her soft breast, a wonder to see. Desire gripped Anchises . . . (81-91)</page><page sequence="18">18 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER Aphrodite here conceals some measure of her divinity so that Anchises will not be frightened away. Presumably, she lessens her height (gods are represented as taller than mortals) and the obvi ous attractiveness of her "form" (eidos). At the same time, she retains enough of her divine attractiveness to overcome Anchises with desire; so even this mortal disguise amounts to another par tial, yet strongly sensed epiphany.29 In what follows, we enjoy the different levels of irony as (a) the "modest maiden" is brought to bed; (b) Aphrodite controls and directs the seduction, which yet (c) reflects her own temporarily inflicted lack of control over her sexual destiny. Hera's "deception of Zeus" in Iliad 14 offers many parallels, some comic, others less so: for after bringing Zeus (with Aphrodite's unintended cooperation) to his knees, so to speak, and then to sleep, she gains only a temporary reversal of the war's killing and suffering. The pleasant interlude on Olympus, the play-acting of easy-living gods, the harmless comedy of divine sex urges, serves as a brilliant foil to the irremediable human tragedy of war and death. (3) Anchises wonders at this beautiful young woman who appears from nowhere, and, being no fool, he takes her for a god dess: "Are you Artemis, or Leto, or golden Aphrodite ... ?" The verse leans towards Aphrodite, away from Artemis; this is not Odysseus and Nausica?. Anchises completes his prayer with a request for success and flourishing offspring. Aphrodite lies: "I am no goddess." A mortal maiden, rather, who honored Artemis, she was carried off by Hermes with the promise that she would be Anchises' wedded wife; so she asks him now, with modest propri ety, to help her prepare for that marriage. But he, of course? entranced by the goddess's sexual power, and deluded into tempo rary denial of what he essentially knows, that she is divine?hur ries her into bed. (4) The bed is described, with its wild-animal skins, a reminder of Aphrodite's universal power over nature as well as Anchises' valor; he removes her jewelry, now more fully described than before, and: He loosed her belt and removed her glistening clothes and laid them down on a chair studded with silver nails, the hero Anchises. He then, by desire of the gods and by fate, with a goddess immortal lay down, a man, not sure of the truth.</page><page sequence="19">Kenneth Reckford 19 The poet emphasizes Anchises' protective ignorance at the fatal moment. The sensual climax, however, comes in the description of Aphrodite's being undressed: a simple line or two, graced with for mulaic dignity and even propriety ("Don't let her clothes just lie there, on the floor!"), and a middle term in the sequence of dress ing, undressing, and dressing again. (5) Afterwards, Aphrodite sheds sweet sleep over Anchises, and resumes her divine appearance (I shall return, with Virgil, to the details of this final epiphany): . . . but around herself she put her fair clothes; and, dressed with all fair things about her, bright among goddesses, she rose and stood in the shelter. Her head touched the well fashioned roof-tree; out from her cheeks shone beauty immortal, such as belongs to fair-crowned Kythereia. (171-5) The condescension to mortality is now redressed, much as Aphrodite in Demodocus's song recovered her divine dignity and grace. Now she awakens Anchises, teasingly, but reasserting the distance between divine and human: "Do I look different?" He, of course, "when he saw the neck and beautiful eyes of Aphrodite," was horrified: "At once, when first I saw you with my eyes, Goddess, I knew you were a god, but you did not speak the truth." (185-6) So he reproaches her, but only to protect himself: she led him on, and now she must show him mercy, or he is lost. She grants his request, on one condition. He must conceal the truth. He may use a cover story, that Aeneas's mother was a nymph. If he complies, Anchises and his descendants will prosper. The promise will be fulfilled, at least in part: for, as we already know from Poseidon's speech in Iliad 20, Aeneas will escape from Troy and his descendants will flourish.30 Indeed, as Jenny Clay points out, he will be the last of the glorious demigods, for, by this very enactment, Zeus put a stop to the casual mating of gods and goddesses with mortal women and men.31 But Aeneas's glory is</page><page sequence="20">20 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER tinged with sadness, even from his conception: not only because he must die, but because of his parents' grief. Aineias, the name given him in the womb, conveys Venus's "dreadful sorrow" (ainon achos) over her close encounter with mortality. And too, the threat hanging over Anchises will be fulfilled: for, evidently, he told the story, and so (depending on what version you follow) he was blinded or crippled, or even killed by Zeus's thunderbolt.32 His descendants may flourish, but he will not. To return to Virgil: he knew, and makes Dido allude to, the story of Aphrodite and Anchises; and he shows the latter crippled or paralyzed by Zeus's thunderbolt, "disliked by the gods," as he himself says, and "useless" ever since.33 That Virgil used the Hymn directly and not, perhaps, just the Cypria, is unprovable.34 He does, however, seem to have observed the core sequence of dis guise, lovemaking, and revelation; and I incline to believe that he remembered and used many details of the narrative. The similari ties are striking, and the uses to which Virgil puts them: (a) Venus's disguise is more thoroughgoing than Aphrodite's, and it associates her strongly and, in many ways, suggestively with her opposite, Diana. Yet her erotic appeal is felt beneath the hunt ress-maiden veneer: nuda genu nodo que sinus collecta fluent is. Baring her knee and gathering in a knot the flowing folds of her clothing. The word nuda, though grammatically restricted in application, yet spreads its influence over the line; and, as Philippe Heuz? has pointed out, Venus's knee here becomes a surprisingly potent locus of erotic attraction.351 suggest, moreover, that sinus is a slip pery word in Latin poetry, and that these particular sinus fluentis indicate not only the folds of Venus's garment that are gathered up here, but also the characteristic swell of her bosom by which, else where, the goddess is recognized; which Aphrodite's gold neck laces emphasized in the Hymn (to Anchises' astonishment, even when she was disguised); and which, in Venus's present appear ance, is not altogether concealed.36 (b) Like Anchises in the Hymn, and unlike Odysseus in Odyssey 6, Aeneas feels certain that this is a goddess: Artemis very likely, or "of the blood of the Nymphs" (an odd expression, possibly</page><page sequence="21">Kenneth Reckford 21 recalling Aphrodite's cover story?). Venus misleads him without lying directly to him, as Aphrodite lied to Anchises. "I don't count myself worthy," she says, "of such an honor." She is play-acting and having fun, and her play modulates directly into the conveying of useful information about Dido and Carthage. Aeneas, when he speaks again, still addresses her as a goddess (o dea): perhaps in admiration of her beauty and grace, perhaps with a stronger intu ition, such as heroes are sometimes granted; and, although he does not overtly recognize his mother, yet he complains to the "virgin huntress" as a small boy might complain to his mother, patheti cally or angrily, when he has been hurt. (c) If we look once more at Venus's epiphany, Dixit et avertens rosea cervice refulsit, ambrosiaeque comae divinum v?rtice odorem spiravere; pedes vestis defluxit ad imos, et vera incessu patuit dea. (Aeneid 1.402-5) her reclothing of herself in divine brilliance and grace combines several motifs from Aphrodite's final epiphany in the Hymn. The verbal and metrical similarities are striking, especially for the god dess's immortal gleam (apelampen I ambroton; refulsit I ambrosi aeque). In the Hymn, Anchises recognizes her beautiful neck and eyes with growing terror; in Virgil, we are shown first the neck's rosy gleam, then the immortal, beautifully scented hair. The slight oddity of v?rtice, "from atop her head," means more if it implies what the Hymn described, how the goddess grew to her full, immortal stature until her head touched the rafters.37 And now, by a bold stroke, Anchises' turning his eyes away in fear is transferred to Venus's turning away, avertens, from Aeneas. If she could play, earlier, at being his cheerful informant and guide, she now resumes her separate role and prepares for departure, leaving her son even more isolated, in his innermost self than he felt before. What I want to highlight once more (before developing its sev eral implications for the Aeneid) is the tremendous sensuality with which Venus is described: a sensuality latent (but not altogether concealed) in her huntress disguise, and latent, too, in that trompe l'oeil vision of her clothing slipping to her feet; and reinforced by the cumulative, very powerful allusions to the erotic tale of Aphrodite and Ares in Odyssey 8, and to the still more centrally</page><page sequence="22">22 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I) : AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER erotic tale, in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, of her seduction of Anchises. We are meant, if I am right, to remember not only Aphrodite's reclothing in divinity after she sleeps with Anchises, but also the way he undressed her earlier, loosing her girdle and stripping off her beautiful clothes. Her naked beauty, whether glimpsed here by Aeneas or only evoked by Virgil in poetic mem ory, is still overwhelmingly alive. It is not, then, just the respectable Roman Venus Genetrix who is revealed to Aeneas here, but also her disreputable other self, the Greek Aphrodite who seduced Anchises and bore Aeneas. Virgil's presentation of the disguise-revelation sequence gives a strange feeling of d?j? vu. It has all happened before. It is as if Aeneas, in this first book of his epic (though not, chronologically, of his adventures), were re-experiencing the divine seduction with which his life began. It is where we all begin?with the beautiful mother, and the enticement of sex, and the coming together pf our two par ents in bed to perform that onetime act on which our very being depends. It is a wonder, and a trouble, and sometimes, as for Homer or Pindar, a moment of god-sent brilliance that offsets and is offset by the enforced sadness of our mortality?a sadness that the very name Aeneas continues to evoke. IV Erotic Confusion Whatever possible enjoyment modern readers might take in Venus's lighthearted intervention in Aeneid 1.305-417 must be offset by Aeneas's private distress and, still more, by foreshadow ings of Dido's tragedy. For Dido too will be compared to Diana, and will go hunting; her chaste, Diana-like self-possession, pain fully recomposed after Sychaeus's murder, will be undermined by Venus and Cupid; and she will become a fatally wounded animal, a victim of the erotic hunt. All this is well known, and painful.381 propose, in this section, to focus on the theme of erotic confusion as it affects Aeneas. What inferences might we draw from Venus's behavior that might help explain Aeneas's own subsequent con duct, especially towards Dido? I suggest, first, that Venus prepares Aeneas emotionally as well as intellectually for the encounter with Dido. Her narrative of Dido's past suffering, struggle, and achievement awakens</page><page sequence="23">Kenneth Reckford 23 Aeneas's admiration for her, as well as ours; but also her strongly erotic presence, on which I have insisted, awakens the probably dormant sexual feelings in Aeneas that will lead, on his part, to their coming together in the cave. Secondly, although Venus comforts and encourages Aeneas, their encounter only adds, in the end, to his cumulative loneliness, frustration, and emotional vulnerability, the bone-weariness (Sainte-Beuve's ''grande lassitude") of body, mind, and spirit in which he first appears, after all the defeats, struggles, and wander ings retold in Books 2 and 3, culminating in Anchises' death at Drepanum and then, as Book 1 begins, the shipwreck.39 It is more than too much. Present happiness slips away; future promises recede. Aeneas has done (painfully, exhaustingly) what the gods required, but his pietas?as he complains, as Venus complained on his behalf?has not been rewarded. What he wants now is rest and re-creation: present happiness, not future. He wants, we might say, to be Odysseus among the Phaeacians, or (better still) Odys seus returned to Ithaca. He wants, here and now, to enjoy the most basic reassurances of human touch and human speech. If Venus reawakens powerful longings that she cannot or will not satisfy, she leaves her son all the more vulnerable in Carthage. When Aeneas comes, then, to Dido's palace, he falls under sev eral kinds of illusion simultaneously. It seems, first, that he is like Odysseus among the hospitable Phaeacians, and on his way home, or like Odysseus actually welcomed back to Ithaca. And second: amid the more-than-Homeric luxury and ease of Dido's palace? the gorgeous couches and tapestries, the flaming torches, and the gilded ceiling panels (laquear?a), to which, with Mr. Eliot, I shall return; amid the feasting and wine and song, which make up, as in Cleopatra's Alexandria, the very pleasure-ground of love, Aeneas is drawn back into his deepest, most nostalgic dream of remem bered happiness. Once again he seems immersed in his mother's magical Never-Never Land of luxe et volupt?. If he fools her, he fools himself as well: for both Aeneas and Dido escape from their responsibilities into a dream of love fulfilled, from which both must be reawakened rudely: Aeneas to his unhappy, loveless work, and Dido to her death. But also (thirdly) I want to suggest that Aeneas carries within him more than the usual Oedipal baggage, the boy's attraction to his mother that, under normal circumstances, can be transferred to another love-object when the time is ripe. For Aeneas's mother</page><page sequence="24">24 RECOGNIZING VENUS (L: AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER is intensely seductive; she is the very archetype of sexual passion; and Aeneas's father has been crippled, perhaps sexually, as an indirect result of the same onetime, glorious encounter that engen dered Aeneas himself. His inborn desire and, with it, his fear must have been intense. He was, from birth, a carrier of greatness, but also "a man of pain." This super-Oedipal dilemma (which also recalls Achilles'), combined with Venus's mix of maternal attention and inexplica ble self-distancing, may help explain some of the oddities in Aeneas's behavior as Virgil portrays them, and as they have been noted and commented on by readers. It is not just that Aeneas sup presses his private pain, that he carries on with a stiff upper lip? the "taciturnity" so well described by Feeney.40 It is not just that he is a loner, separated by his commission from the ordinary pleas ures and comforts of life. There is also something confused and confusing in his behavior to women, and in his inability to register genuine emotion until afterwards, when it is too late.41 In their flight from Troy, he lets Creusa fall behind, and loses her, and then retraces his steps, seeking her passionately through the burning city?until her ghost reassures him that she is in the gods' hands, under the Great Mother's protection and care. And then, he leaves Dido: by the gods' orders, to be sure, but also with attempted secrecy, and with passionless explanations (though what else could he have done?); and only when he meets Dido's angry, alien ated ghost in Hades does he pour forth, unavailing, the passionate protest that we wanted earlier, that might at least have answered (if unavailingly) to Dido's own passionate love and grief. Aeneas may be the hero that fate and Roman history require, the great, solid, unshaken oak tree whose roots sink as deep towards Hell? which is where his feelings are?as its leafy fingers reach toward Heaven. But he is also, Virgil suggests, an emotional cripple, not unlike his love-blast?d father. He cannot feel, cannot express feel ing, when he ought. He can weep only afterwards, when it is too late, and when his personal grief and frustrated longing?and the anger arising from these?become too great to bear. And there is more. We remember how Venus disappeared at the moment of recognition; how, even as Aeneas recognized the god dess and the mother, she had turned away, and was walking, then swiftly running away (fugientem) to her own private world. It is the first of many disappearances that Aeneas suffers, especially when ghosts or visions of the beloved dead slip from his embrace.42</page><page sequence="25">Kenneth Reckford 25 (That had happened to Odysseus too, although his mother Anticleia's shade explains the facts of death to him with an emo tional ease and naturalness that Aeneas will not find with Venus, or even with Anchises in the underworld.) But we might ask: has Aeneas himself a comparable tendency to disappear? Why, if he loves Dido, does he "burn" to leave sweet Carthage once Mercury brings him word of Jupiter's command? Why does he put up no resistance? (He did, at Troy.) Why does he make secret plans to depart, without Dido's knowledge (though he intends to speak to her at the right time, if there is one?which, of course, there isn't) ? Is there some psychological and moral truth, after all, in his wretched miscasting as the ungrateful Jason of Euripides' Medea, or as the equally ungrateful and unremembering (immemor) The seus of Catullus 64?431 think, there is; and this?whatever excuses we make for Aeneas's actions?must give us pause. Aeneas resembles his mother, then, in his tendency to with draw, and even to disappear. He resembles his father, in being wounded.44 And, again, he resembles his mother in appearance (he is extremely handsome), but also in a certain unconscious insin cerity. Despite all his virtues?and perhaps, indeed, on account of his deepest erotic feelings?he cannot really be counted on in mat ters of love. The leitmotifs of disguise and deception, and the confusion of familial and sexual love, continue into the strange episode where Venus substitutes Cupid for Ascanius. He has cruel instructions: to inflame the queen with love and madness, to overcome her resis tance, "so she will be bound, with me, by a great love for Aeneas" (magno Aeneae mecum teneatur amore). It is an odd triangle, of sexual passion and (passionate) maternal love.45 At the heart of the confusion is the image, three times repeated, of the child in the mother's lap: first, in Venus's instructions, and second, when she carries off Ascanius to Idalia: '. .. tu faciem illius noctem non amplius unam falle dolo et notos pueri puer indue vultus, ut, cum te gremio accipiet laetissima Dido regalis inter mensas laticemque Lyaeum, cum dabit amplexus atque oscula dulc?a figet, occultum inspires ignem fallasque veneno.' paret Amor dictis carae genetricis, et alas exuit et gressu gaudens incedit luli.</page><page sequence="26">26 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I) : AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER At Venus Ascanio placidam per membra quietem inrigat, et fotum gremio dea tollit in altos Idaliae lucos, ubi mollis amaracus ilium floribus et dulci aspirans complectitur umbra. (1.683-94) "... Assume his appearance for one night, only one; conceal your trickery; put on the boy's familiar face, so that, when Dido draws you, so happily, upon her lap, amid the royal feasting and the release of flowing wine, when she embraces you and plants sweet kisses upon your lips, you will breathe hidden fires within her, and treacherous poison." Amor obeys his dear mother's bidding. He strips off his wings and exultantly walks with Iulus's gait. But Venus drenches Ascanius's limbs in peaceful rest, and, cherishing him in her lap, carries him off to the high groves of Idalia, where soft-blooming marjoram perfumes and enfolds him in the sweetness of its shade. and finally, after the false Ascanius arrives: Ule ubi complexu Aeneae colloque pependit et magnum falsi implevit genitoris amorem, reginam petit, haec o culis, haec pectore toto haeret et interdum gremio fovet inscia Dido insidat quantus miserae deus. (1.715-9) After he embraced Aeneas, hanging upon his neck, and filled to the brim his false father's love, he sought the queen. With her eyes, with her whole heart she cleaves to him, and sometimes cherishes him in her lap, not knowing what a mighty god is moving in ambush against her unhappy self. The diabolical nature of Cupid's behavior stands out more clearly if we contrast Apollonius's Argonautica, where Cupid sim ply shoots an arrow at Medea upon Aphrodite's request, inflam ing her with passion for Jason; or contrast its sequel in Euripides'</page><page sequence="27">Kenneth Reckford 27 Medea, where Medea's two sons are unwitting instruments, and then helpless victims, of her revenge. Virgil recalls that scene when he introduces the false Ascanius with symbolically destructive gifts for Dido, but here it is worse: for the boy himself inflames her, not just the gifts; he embraces his "false father" (Aeneas, with a proleptic hint of Jason?), filling him too with passion; and amidst all the happiness, luxury, and ease, the child whom Dido will take so lovingly upon her lap must requite that trust with fire and poison. It is a nightmarish transformation of innocence into horror. By contrast (b), Ascanius is cast into deep sleep and "cherished" (fotum gremio: the root meaning of foveo is "to warm," hence to foster, comfort, or encourage) upon the goddess's lap, and carried off to Venus's own, private, magical world, where he is altogether cherished and protected. Virgil draws on pastoral imagery from his own Eclogues to describe the loveliness and protection that the child enjoys.46 It is a world of escape from ordinary cares and dan gers, the "soft Golden Age" evoked so often and so nostalgically by Virgil. The passage ends with umbra, the pastoral shade. Psy chologically, it stirs our deepest, most nostalgic memories of infancy, of that dimly remembered time when we were altogether loved, cherished, and shielded from harm?a time of enormous happiness and oneness with our surroundings, and one which lov ers, perhaps, try to recover in intercourse. In passage (c) the innocence of (b) is subtly, insidiously trans formed into the destructive horror of (a). The child's settling into his mother's lap becomes the occasion by which Dido's inmost being is invaded by the god of sexual passion. Indeed, the very words (gremio fovet, insidat) lose their innocence, suggesting the adult sexuality to which Dido is drawn, a sexuality that Virgil will depict again, in Aeneid 8, at the climax of Vulcan's lovemaking with Venus: ea verba locutus optatos dedit amplexus placidumque petivit coniugis infusus gremio per membra sopor em. (8.404-6) With these words, he gave the desired embraces, and, poured out in his wife's lap, he sought, through all his limbs, the peacefulness of sleep.</page><page sequence="28">28 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I;: AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER This language is ambiguous and refined. The "desired embraces"?his? hers? of both??suggest at once Venus's duplici tous game, with her not-so-hidden agenda, and the mutual enjoy ment of sex as men and women may (sometimes) experience it. The words infusus gremio suggest Vulcan's ejaculation and the limbs' relaxation that follows.47 On the one hand, the passage recalls Lucretius's majestic description (DRN 1.250-1) of the unit ing of heaven and earth through fertilizing rain. On the other, it is simple and human. The male lover who vaunted his prowess ear lier becomes, after lovemaking, almost a helpless child in his mother's arms.48 In our usual chronological rereadings of the Aeneid, starting with Book 2, we think of lulus as representative of Aeneas's future, and of Aeneas's responsibility to that future, to which his present happiness must be sacrificed time and again; and as Aeneas carries Anchises on his shoulders and leads little lulus by the hand out of Troy (while Creusa falls behind), we think how the generational middle man is denied any life of his own, even as his commitment to his mission, through labor and pietas, continues to grow. The gentle flame playing on Iulus's hair late in Book 2 gives hope for the future, in contrast with the destructive fires by which Troy perished. As lulus grows up, and as Aeneas leaves Troy further and further behind, only to be revisited like a false image at Buthrotum, or like a long-forgotten dream in the under world, Books 1 and 4, the stay with Dido, may be re-envisioned as a diversion, an unfortunate interruption that changes the meaning of Aeneas's life and destiny in no essential way. And yet, by Vir gil's own chosen presentation of events, Book 1 gives us a radically different point of departure. Aeneas's encounter with Venus reen acts his own seductive engendering. The exchange of lulus and Cupid recalls the child that Aeneas once was, or might have been: the child nurtured in a goddess's immortal lap; the child once car ried, perhaps, in a magical journey through the air to his aging, mortal father. To remember that lost child would be too much pain. No wonder Aeneas's stay with Dido might seem to his con fused mind like a lovely dream, from which the gods reawakened him, too soon, into harsh reality. But Venus too is at fault for her son's emotional confusion, and for the disaster at Carthage. For if, on the one hand, she acts in Aeneas's interest, to ensure his safety at Carthage against Juno's known enmity and power; if she binds Dido to him, while know</page><page sequence="29">Kenneth Reckford 29 ing from Jupiter that his great future, the Italian and Roman heri tage of his (and her) descendants, will not be abridged: still, she is also carried away by the pleasure of deploying her own erotic weapons, for what she does best is to join people, sometimes hap pily, sometimes savagely and inappropriately, in the toils of love.49 And too, like all mothers, Venus wanted her son to be utterly happy. In her complaint to Jupiter Venus pictured Antenor as hav ing reached a land of peace, happiness and sensually luxurious ease: as having penetrated, in fact (the language is sexual), into the maternal depths of Italy.50 That was not (as Wlosok points out) in Jupiter's plan for Aeneas, which requires labor, sacrifice, and more than one man's lifetime to accomplish: there must be harsh wars in Italy before a peace can be won; and there must be unremitting toil, war, and sacrifice before the Augustan Peace can be ensured, ushering in that hoped-for second Age of Gold. But the first, "soft golden age" of childhood innocence?when Mother Earth gave all good things without toil or effort to humankind, and people lived happy lives, in close communion with the gods?that age of Saturn was hidden away (Virgil tells us, in Georgics 1) by Jupiter's harsh orders, so that humans would be forced to lead hardwork ing, moral, and ultimately civilized lives. Virgil seems himself to have accepted the iron law of work and history; and in happier moments, to have envisioned something of Saturn's reign as still surviving, or being constantly renewed, in the hard work and old-time morality and piety of agrarian Italy. This was the "hard golden age," a workable compromise with dreams. And yet, throughout Virgil's poems, as they (and he) evolve from Eclogues to Georgics to Aeneid, there is always that stab of nostalgia for the soft golden age, the remembered loveliness of the world's infancy, and ours. We have felt its summons in descriptions of Venus's private landscape. It is where the child in Aeneas, the forgotten child in all of us, most deeply belongs. It is the source of Aeneas's deepest homesickness?deeper even than for beloved Troy; and by Venus's unconscious connivance, it draws him into Dido's love, and Dido's world, for a tragically brief, dreamlike, and ultimately confusing moment of happiness. There will be no room for love (amor) or for private gratification in his life of sacrifice and service. There will be room for anger and frustration: but that is another story.</page><page sequence="30">30 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER V The Contradictions of Venus Let me end with a disturbing moment, as I began. Late in Book 8 Venus finds Aeneas resting in a hidden valley, brings him the arms forged by Vulcan at her request, and encourages him to move boldly into battle against Turnus. Virgil concludes, dixit, et amplexus nati Cytherea petivit, arma sub adversa posuit radiantia quercu. (8.615-6) So Cythera's goddess spoke, and sought her son's embraces. The gleaming arms she placed beneath an opposite oak. The gleaming metal is set against the living oak, the weapons of war juxtaposed with the peaceful, natural world heretofore undis turbed by history. And here, for the first time, Venus "seeks her son's embraces." In Book 1, she had eluded him. In Book 2, she appeared to him, clear as never before, to illuminate the claims of reason, duty, and resignation within his fighting soul (much as Athena restrained Achilles from killing Agamemnon, in Iliad 1? although Venus may also have had a hidden "Aphroditic" agenda, to save Helen).51 Now she is Everymother embracing her war-bent son. But also as Putnam has said, When she saw Aeneas she first "offered herself of her own accord" (se . . . obtulit ultro), a phrase Virgil uses elsewhere only of erotic availability. Then, after a brief speech, "the goddess of Cythera sought the embraces of her son." . .. She must seduce Vulcan at the creation, Aeneas at the acceptance, I fully agree, and would only add that this is the second figurative seduction of Aeneas by his beautiful mother. This is not to deny that Venus is a remarkably attentive and helpful goddess-mother. Her activities on Aeneas's behalf in Book 8 counteract Juno's arousing of the "storm" of war and turbulence in Book 7, much as her interventions in Book 1 responded to Juno's savage attack earlier in that book. Like Homer's Thetis, she</page><page sequence="31">Kenneth Reckford 31 requests and obtains arms for her son, though more on her own initiative; but unlike Thetis, she gives the signal for what is virtu ally a Roman inauguration of a righteous war.53 On the Shield, too, Venus has become a literally central Roman goddess as, between Neptune and Minerva, her old opponents, she outfaces the Egyptian demons at Actium. She has become powerful in war, where the Homeric Aphrodite remained a joke. She is Victrix as well as Genetrix, a strong, effective patron from Aeneas to Augustus?though also, like Apollo, with implicit attributes of peacetime happiness. Has Venus become respectable? In Roman worship, perhaps, and certainly in Augustan propaganda; but in Virgil's poem? I think, not quite. Let us return to Venus and Vul can in Book 8. This scene is oddly subversive, both structurally and in relation to its different literary antecedents. It has a surface lightness and comicality, as Venus employs rhetorical compliments and physical incitements to guide Vulcan towards the desired consummation (all summed up in those optatos amplexus?his, hers, and theirs); and as Vulcan, so allured, makes extravagant protestations of love. This is how lovers always have behaved, and always will. The scene is Homeric in its lightness, as the careless tricks, quarrels, and courtesies of Homer's gods offset the painful struggles of mortal heroes. It recalls Thetis's visit to the courteous Hephaestus in Iliad 18 (though he was married there to a courteous Grace); but still more, it recalls the highly elaborated "Deception of Zeus" in Iliad 14, where Hera, with Aphrodite's unsuspecting cooperation, deploys all her charms to seduce Zeus into making love to her, under cover of a golden cloud, and then into falling asleep, so that Poseidon can return, against Zeus's orders, to help the Greeks. All this accomplishes little. It is, mainly, a poetic diversion amid the long accounts of fighting and killing. The comedy is delightful, as Hera deceives Aphrodite?all she needs is a bit of love-magic to help old Oceanus and Tethys with their interpersonal relations? and as Zeus is driven impetuously to make love on the spot: "Never before was I taken with such passion for a female, not even when I felt passion for X, and Y, and Z ..." (the list goes on). Zeus succumbs, briefly, and forgets the battle; and so, briefly and hap pily, do we. We also enjoy a vision of almost cosmic sexuality, a "marriage of heaven and earth" from which all fertile life proceeds.</page><page sequence="32">32 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER More than on Homer, Virgil builds on Lucretius's great proem to his De Rerum Natura. There Venus is celebrated and invoked: Aeneadum genetrix, hominum divumque voluptas, alma Venus.... Mother of the Aeneidae, pleasure of men and gods, fostering Venus.... She is (to simplify the old riddle, What is a beautiful love-goddess like this doing in an Epicurean poem of atoms and void?) a person ification of the world's ongoing creative energy, the generative, life-giving forces that wage war forever against the forces of decay and death. The poem begins, appropriately, with this hymn to Venus, celebrating the Life Force as it, or better She, extends her sway through all the cosmos, from stars down to birds, beasts, and fishes. The proem to Book 1 breathes beauty, creative power, and happiness. Peace and generativity are in the ascendant. And Lucre tius's double request to Venus is, though not strictly Epicurean, yet consonant with her power here described. He asks, first, that she shed her special erotic charm over his poetry, which must entice the reader into the study of Epicurean philosophy and sci ence as the only true path (it is implied) to genuine creativity and happiness. This will be a good seduction, one that will "charm" but never "harm" the reader. And second, because Memmius (Lucretius's patron, the prototypical layman) cannot pursue Epi curean tranquillity easily, or even fittingly, amid the turmoil of late Republican politics and war, Lucretius asks Venus to draw Mars into her embrace and then, when he is helpless, to ask him for peace for the Roman people. This is evidently an act of sympa thetic magic. As Mars succumbs, almost comically (but this is high comedy) to Venus's embrace?as he throws himself upon her lap and, childlike, gazes lovingly and beseechingly up into her eyes; and as, in a different pose, he lies on his back: a familiar sexual posture, here symbolic of the Great Warrior's subjugation by love?Lucretius invites us to join him in celebrating the triumph of life over death, peace over war, and happiness over misery. That triumph will not be final: for Lucretius's epic ends, as each individual human life must end, in decay and death. Nor does it stand without contradictions: for anthropomorphic gods are not easily put to rest within an Epicurean poem?they do not always</page><page sequence="33">Kenneth Reckford 33 stay where they are told; and Venus, as goddess of sexual passion, can be quite uncontrollable. If Lucretius's proem celebrates the "safe sex" of cosmic creativity, his magnificent, often satiric dia tribe in Book 4 against the passion of love reveals how much dam age Venus (as traditionally viewed) can do in human life, as lovers fall prey to costly and dangerous illusions about each other and about what, in lovemaking, they are trying to attain. Better the casual use of prostitutes, of lower-case venus (= "sex"), than the dangerous, ambivalent, and tumultuous human emotions that love, that great tyrant, can arouse. All such desires must be subju gated by Epicurean philosophy, as much as ambition must, or ava rice, or the great fears of death and divine wrath. It may even be that, as J. P. Elder suggested, the figure of Mars in the proem rep resents mortal man in his striving after a pleasure, tranquillity, and peace that is ultimately divine?a pleasure in which only the most enlightened and disciplined Epicurean saints will be able to participate.54 Against this Lucretian background, Virgil's Venus-Vulcan scene is doubly disturbing: first, because it echoes the Homeric seduction of Zeus, not to mention that old disreputable tale of Ares and Aphrodite (for as Mars was, ironically, "conquered by love," devictus amore in Lucretius, Vulcan is now "bound by love's chains," devinctus amore, in a clever reversal of his own dubious achievement in binding Ares and Aphrodite); and second, because, even when this married pair of gods make love, the result of their lovemaking will be not peace but war?the forging of divine armor for Aeneas. We might say, of course, that love and war go together, for Venus and the absent Mars are both ancestors of the Roman people. We might say that there is a rhythm in Aeneid 8 like the rhythm of life itself, an alternation of night and day, sleeping and waking, rest and renewed labor, peace and war; and that Vulcan's lovemaking with Venus and his return to hard work recall Virgil's own agrarian ideals of work, piety, and justice in the Georgics (especially Book 2). We might draw a line of desired consequences from Venus's inspired lovemaking, through the creative fire of Vulcan's forge, to the weapons of a necessary and successful warfare by which enemies to peace are overcome, and Roman history assured (with its continuing wars), and an ulti mate Augustan peace. That is the vision, anyway, that Aeneas will carry, uncomprehending, on his shield?and it is the Actiad that Virgil might have written. But the Aeneid proclaims, equally, the</page><page sequence="34">34 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER wretchedness of war. Books 9-12 will focus on killing, grief, loss, defeat, and "tragic victory." Juno, as much as Venus, will have her way. Nature will be violated, the peaceful countryside despoiled, the agrarian dream of virtue and happiness undone. And the shad ows reach back into Book 8, into the loveliest moments of rest and reassurance: for Aeneas's coming brings new trouble and war to Italy, and Pallas, who first welcomes Aeneas to the future site of Rome, will be an early victim of that war. I shall not follow Venus's sometimes triumphant progress through these later books as she enters into parliamentary debate against Juno, or miraculously heals Aeneas's arrow wound, or turns his fury against the city and civilians of Lavinium (not unlike General Sherman, who hated war); or, in a final, morally ambigu ous gesture, pulls his spear violently out of the stump of Faunus's sacred olive tree where it was caught. Let me return, rather, to her last open appearance to Aeneas: dixit, et amplexus nati Cytherea petivit, arma sub adversa posuit radiantia quercu. This is, I suggest, the second seduction of Aeneas. Earlier, his mother's appearance drew him erotically towards Dido, in a scene that ironically and disturbingly reenacted Venus's seduction of Anchises in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite. This time, Venus enfolds him in a dangerous and fatal embrace as she sends him off to war, indeed to the whole series of wars and abnegations that make up Roman history?sends him into a world in which per sonal happiness is no longer an option. He will be safe, to be sure, and victorious. That much Venus ascertains. What will remain for Aeneas personally, after grief and rage, and before his premature death, may be mostly regret. To return to Venus: she might have been for Virgil, as earlier (and at least momentarily) for Lucretius, a reconciling figure who bridged the disparate worlds of love and power, private happiness and public need. And we must not forget how beautiful her moth erly interventions must have seemed to Virgil's early readers as she appears to advise, help, comfort, and encourage Aeneas: in Car thage, and (earlier) in Troy, and then in Latium. She does all that an attentive Roman mother would do to assure her son's success.55 She acts continuously as the Aeneadum genetrix, the ancestress and guardian of Aeneas, the gens Iulia, and the extended Roman progeny to come. Her presence must have seemed very reassuring</page><page sequence="35">Kenneth Reckford 35 to Virgil's readers, as to the readers of Naevius and Ennius earlier; and their hearts must have leapt up at those moments when erotic loveliness and Roman protohistory touch. I would not want to spoil even one of those moments with the retrospective doubts of a modern-day critic. Beauty and loveliness have, whether in life or in poetry, an immediate preciousness and glory before which, as before the goddess herself, we must feel awe. But I have suggested that Venus's glory is altered, as her appearance sometimes is, when she plays, or fails to play, older, often Homeric parts. She is no more Nausica?, or Athena, than she is Diana. But she is, in so many ways, Aphrodite?from the Iliad, or the Odyssey, or the Homeric Hymn, or Euripidean tragedy: which is to say that her eroticism is as dangerous as it is lovely, and that it cannot be harnessed reliably to Aeneas's personal needs, let alone to history's. For she stirs deep, erotic memories and desires that cannot be attained: not by ordinary mortals, and certainly not by her duty-bound son. For good or bad, she interferes, deploying her armory of love, and sometimes pursuing a play-agenda whose implications are not clear even to herself. Virgil's Venus is not, then, a figure to be comprehended easily, far less reduced to allegory. She is not simple. Nor is she double, like the Greek "celestial" and "common" Aphrodites?though I have sometimes used "Aphrodite" and "Venus" as a shorthand for different aspects of her personality and behavior evoked by Virgil. She is, like Virgil's other gods, a fictional creation; and like them, she is a presence and a power that goes beyond the tropes of fic tion, that more than clarifies human psychology and the causes of things.56 She is a great and dangerous goddess, whose gifts (as Homer knew, and Euripides, and Virgil) could not be refused, and who could bring great happiness and great misery. If we recognize Venus?and even with Virgil's help, we cannot do this any better than Aeneas could, or Anchises before him?we must do so in humility and fear, and with the gratitude also that the French reconnaissance implies. Where but in prayer should scholarship conclude?57</page><page sequence="36">36 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER NOTES 1. Virgil. The Aeneid, a new prose translation by David West (London 1990); The Aeneid of Virgil, translated by Robert Fitzgerald (New York 1984); The Aeneid of Virgil: A New Verse Translation by C. Day Lewis (Oxford and New York 1953). 2. Austin's discussion of defluxit (P. Vergili Maronis Aeneidos Liber Primus. With a commentary by R. G. Austin [Oxford 1971]) deserves quoting in full, as the most helpful: The 'Tyrian girl' till now had been nuda genu nodoque sinus collecta fluentis (320): now her dress 'flowed down' to her feet, and she appeared in the palla of a divinity; cf. Prop. 3.17.32 feries nudos veste fluente pedes (of Bacchus). But defluxit keeps something of its literal sense; Venus's dress fell with the shimmering motion of water: cf. Herrick, When as in silks my Julia goes, Then, then (me thinks) how sweetly flowes That liquefaction of her clothes. 3. Servius had already compared Aen. 1.46 (Juno: ast ego quae divum incedo regina) and 496?97 (Dido: regina ad templum forma pulcherrima Dido I incessit.). As Cartault pointed out (L'Art de Virgile dans l'En?ide [Paris 1926] 1.115 n. 50), Virgil makes Venus as "majestueuse"" here as her rival Juno. 4. Commentators have noted the unusual hiatus after dea (1.405). The goddess reveals herself; Aeneas is shocked (pause): it is his mother; she is hurrying away (fugientem), abandoning her slow, dignified gait (ingressu), even as he addresses her. 5. Although vera . . . patuit dea (1.405) may be taken as equivalent to confessa deam (2.591: thus R. D. Williams in his 1972 commentary), pateo may also denote visible exposure: cf. OLD 6, citing Ovid, Tr. 3.10.20, ora . . . de toto corpore sola patent ("of the entire body, only the face is visible"). In the background are nuda genu (1.320), reinforced by nudavit... retexit ("baring" of a corpse, "uncovering" of a murder, 1.355-56). 6. Ovid, Amores 1.5.17-22 comes closest. Here disrobing is quick, yet produces an erotic epiphany of sorts: ut stetit ante oculos p?sito velamine nostros ("as she stood, her clothing put off, before our eyes"). The reader will participate vicari ously in Ovid's voyeuristic pleasure. 7. For Ariadne, Peleus and Thetis, and Dido, see M. Wigodsky, Vergil and Early Latin Poetry (Wiesbaden 1972), 129-30. Wlosok (A. Wlosok, Die G?ttin Venus in Vergils Aeneis [Heidelberg 1967]), 86, notes that something of Ariadne's isolation and abandonment (Catul. 64.166, nee missas audire queunt nee reddere voces) recurs in Aeneas's frustrated words, audire et reddere voces {Aen. 1.409). 8. Aen. 1.404, pedes vest?s defluxit ad imos, most clearly echoes Catul. 64.66-67 (delapsa, pedes [same metrical position], fluctus) ; but cf. also Aen. 1.320, nuda ... fluentis, and Catul. 64.52 {fluentisono), 62 {fluctu?t), and 128-9. 9. Seeing and desiring: lines 16-19, 86, 265-68; eyes closed in sleep or death, 122-3, 188; gazing in vain, or with tragic results, 126-7, 219-20, 241-3: and con trast Aegeus's wish earlier that "the yardarms put off their funereal color" (234).</page><page sequence="37">Kenneth Reckford 3 7 10. See F. Klingner, "Catulls Peleus-Epos" (1956), reprinted in Studien (Zurich and Stuttgart 1964), 177-85. 11. Klingner, 185 n. 2, rejects complete nudity as too divergent from artistic cus tom; Ariadne's clothing, he thinks, slips from her upper body only. Cf., however, line 66: omnia quae toto delapsa e corpore passim. We are to recall the Nereids in 17-18, nudato corpore, though only half-visible above the waves. 12. C. -A. Sainte-Beuve, ?tude sur Virgile (Paris 1870), 258-9, says it best: [We can see . . .] comment, tout en se ressouvenant de cette amoureuse et voluptueuse rencontre avec Anchise, en la sous-entendant, pour ainsi dire, le po?te a pris plaisir ? la transformer en une scene tendrement maternelle avec le fils ... [so the earlier scene left only a light trace, as of a "parfum"] My essay could be read as a qualifying footnote to that sous-entendant, a disagree ment about the relative strength of the parfum so powerfully described in French. Otis comes close (B. Otis, Virgil: A Study in Civilized Poetry [Oxford 1964], 235 n. 1: "Only Sainte-Beuve seems to have grasped Virgil's mixture of sensual and mater nal elements in this scene. . ."; and still closer (236), but he backs away at the cru cial moment: Her final reversion to herself in propria persona, the lovely goddess who once bent over the couch of Anchises, is just sufficiently sensuous to connote what cannot be overtly mentioned without spoiling the precarious dignity of the scene. 13.

Buches der Aeneis," Hermes 97 (1969) 346-61, 355-6. Stahl explains Venus's two interventions in Book 1 by a masterful analysis of her shifting psychological states, from sad to happy to fearful again. Jupiter's reassurance wears off, as hypnosis might. 16. This background is helpfully reviewed by V. Buchheit, Vergil ?ber die Sendung Roms (Heidelberg 1963)?a very conservative view; Wlosok (n. 7), 109 and n. 8 (Naevius and Ennius), 80 and n. 27 (Venus's special protection, her guiding star); D. C. Feeney, The Gods in Epic (Oxford 1991), 109-12 (Naevius), 125-8 (Ennius). Two scenes from Ennius's Annales, Book 1, are especially relevant: see The Annals of Ennius, Edited with Introduction and Commentary by Otto Skutsch (Oxford 1985), frs . 15-19,60-62. In the latter scene, first Aeneas (in a dream), then Venus comforts Ilia. In the former, Anchises, divinely inspired, urges Aeneas to leave Troy, and Venus comes down in the darkness to confirm his request; cf. Aen. 2.588-621 (Venus and Aeneas), 679-704 (the omens for Anchises, recalling Venus's guiding star?). Overall, Anchises is still honored in Virgil but loses much of the direct prophetic inspiration and closeness to Venus that he apparently had in Nae vius and Ennius. 17. Cf. W. D. Anderson, "Venus and Aeneas: The Difficulties of Filial Pietas" CJ 50 (1954-55), 233-38; Austin (n. 2) on Aen. 1.321; R. O. A. M. Lyne, Further Voices in Vergil's Aeneid (Oxford 1987), 37-38: "They [the gods] may compel men to earnestness and indeed to morality, but they themselves are unconstrained."</page><page sequence="38">38 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I): AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER 18. In Aen. 4.128, dolis risit Cytherea repertis, Venus laughs (a) at uncovering Juno's wiles, (b) at improvising her own. Her Homeric epithets, philommeid?s ("fond of smiles") and dolophroneousa ("with guileful thoughts"), are deliberately recalled here and combined. 19. Cf. lusit amantem {Aen. 1.352), venit imago (353), crudelis aras (355), odium crudele tyranni (361, a transferred epithet). Virgil's earlier juxtapositions of "cruel" and "mother" resonate here: from Eel. 5.20-3, where Daphnis's mother cries out at the cruelty of gods and stars; Eel. 8.47-50, where Amor teaches a mother (Medea?) to kill her children, but she "too is cruel" [not just Love]: crudelis tu quoque, mater (twice repeated); and G. 324-5, 356 (Aristaeus complains to his mother Cyrene, "Where has your love for me gone?" and calls her "cruel"). 20.

Con trast Odysseus to the Phaeacians {Od. 9.19-20): "I am Odysseus, Laertes' son, famed for my devices among all peoples_" Aeneas's mother is tricky, not Aeneas. 23. For this and many other instances of Aeneas's isolation, see D. C. Feeney, "The Taciturnity of Aeneas," [1983], reprinted with corrections in Oxford Read ings in Vergil's Aeneid, ?d. S. J. Harrison (Oxford and New York 1990), 167-90. Aeneas "moves in solitude through a world which yields him no intimacy or comfort...." (183). Feeney contrasts "the healing and unifying power of dialogue" in Homer (179), with its "open, cooperative, and sustaining speech" (181). 24. C. P. Segal, "Art and the Hero: Participation, Detachment, and Narrative Point of View in Aeneid 1," Arethusa 14 (1981), 67-83. 25. Segal, 73: "When Aeneas meets Dido in the next scene, he seems to enjoy the controlling advantage of divine invisibility.

This section owes much to my colleague Peter Smith's Nursling of Mortality: A Study of the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (Frankfort 1981). See also J. S. Clay, The Politics of Olympus: Form and Meaning in the Major Homeric Hymns (Princeton 1989), 152-201. 28. Clay, 171, n. 62 (with references), points out that, while Hymn. 58-9 parallel Od. 8.362-3 and 364-5, lines 60 and 63 correspond to //. 14.169 and 172: "The very fact that the lines can be used both as preparation and aftermath of erotic activity suggests that they are formulaic in Homer.

Smith compares Odysseus's fear of being killed or unmanned, in Odyssey 10.299?301, 341 (Circe) with Hymn. 189-90. On ou biothalmios (189), he points out, "If what the later punishment was meant to evoke was impotence, or lameness coupled with impotence . . . then punishment and progeny themes were being skillfully joined." 33. At Aen. 2.647-9; but Anchises' complaint is followed by good omens, reas surances of divine favor towards the family. Lines 699-70, hie vero victus genitor se tollit ad auras adfaturque deos et sanctum sidus ador?t, Now my father, quite overcome, raised himself up towards heaven, prayed to the gods, and worshiped the holy star, suggest almost a miracle of healing, as the crippled old man lifts himself up. They also evoke, behind the new Caesarian comet, an older tradition of Venus's guiding star (although Jupiter, not Venus, now sends reassurance). 34. The Hymn to Aphrodite is closely related to the Cypria: see Clay (n. 27), 156-7 and notes. Did Virgil use one or both? The problem is complex. Cf. Richard son's discussion (n. 29, 237) of Apollonius's description of Thetis's attempt to immortalize Achilles (Ap. Rhod. 4.869ff.), which (a) may imitate the Hymn to Demeter, or else (b) both may follow some model, "an early epic version of the childhood of Achilles," perhaps the Cypria. If (b) is correct, notice how closely the details are still preserved; but (a) seems simpler and more natural. So too, I imagine, with Virgil and The Hymn to Aphrodite, although he knew the Cypria well and used it often: see E. C. Kopff, "Virgil and the Cyclic Epics," ANRW, 11.31.2, 919-47. 35. P. Heuz?, L'Image du corps dans l'oeuvre de Virgile (Rome 1985), 329-31, describes the disguised Venus's attractiveness within a larger discussion of "Le D?sir et la Beaut?" (319-51). Heuz? reminds us (328) that nudus always carries some element of desire; he compares E. Rohmer's film, Le Genou de Claire, and shows how the cothurnus both conceals and reveals (329-30). His appreciation of Virgil's eroticism takes up (correctly, I think) where Sainte-Beuve and Otis (n. 12) left off: Ainsi la figure que Virgile invente combine subtilement les contraires. En prenant l'apparence de Diane, Venus semble renoncer ? la volupt?; mais en transparaissant sous les traits de Diane, Venus ajoute le fr?missement de la volupt? ? la beaut? froide, rendant plus s?duisante encore la fille de Latone. Le personnage ainsi cr?? . . . suscite en m?me temps le d?sir et la peur de d?sir. (331) 36.

Segal (n. 24), 71, discusses other associations of v?rtice that may resonate here: the "disorienting whirlpool" of Aen. 1.117 and "the removed height of the Olympian dwelling" at 1.225-6. 38. Dido, the Diana-like huntress, will become the hunted, and Aeneas and Venus the hunters: see V.

I would add that "Diana" is subverted by Venus (much as Artemis is in Euripides' Hippolytus), and that Dido will return to Diana Hecate in her passion and death, and to the lunar Diana in the underworld, where she may possibly, like the moon, find renewal. 39. Otis (n. 12), 234, warns us not to forget, "When we first meet Aeneas, we do not in fact know his real situation ... and hence cannot truly gauge his psychic vul nerability to the kind of danger that awaits him at Carthage. But this is an ignorance that he shares with the reader for he himself does not realize his own situation. Thus the rest of Book 1 (305-756) is ironic and deceptive.... This ignorance is also reflected in the actions of Venus and Juno. . . ." 40. Feeney (n. 23), 179-83. Otis (n. 12), 237-8, suggests that the protective mist cast around Aeneas may indicate his "psychological distance" from the world around him. 41. See Lyne (n. 17), 145-206 on Aeneas's minimal interaction with others and his inhibition in expressing or communicating feelings; also on the "cut-off" phe nomenon that often leaves Aeneas saying too little or too late. On Aeneas's treat ment of women, see also C. Perkell, "On Creusa, Dido, and the Quality of Victory in Virgil's Aeneid," in Reflections of Women in Antiquity, ed. H. Foley (New York ?C London 1981). I am impressed now by the psychological cogency of Van Nortwick's argument that Aeneas betrays his own essential nature, kills a "second self" twice over (Dido, Turnus), and, unlike Gilgamesh and Achilles in the epic tra dition, fails notably to reintegrate that slain second self into a mature human per sonality (T. Van Nortwick, Somewhere I Have Never Travelled [New York and Oxford 1992], 89-182). 42. Ghosts slipping away: Creusa {Aen. 2.790-94), Anchises {Aen. 5.738-45, Aen. 6.697-702; also, Aen. 6.688-9, datur ora tueri, I nate, tua et notas audire et reddere voces, contrasts with Aen. 1.408-9: the separation of goddess and mortal resembles that of dead and living. The human longing for contact recurs, and the frustration. On ghosts slipping away, see C. Segal, "'Like Winds and Winged Dream': A Note on Virgil's Development," CJ 69 (1973-74), 97-101; for Virgil vs Homer, C. Segal, "Vanishing Shades: Virgil and Homeric Repetitions," ?ranos 72 (1974), 34-52; for embraces variously denied or given, E. Belfiore, "Ter Frustra Comprensa: Embraces in the Aeneid," Phoenix 38 (1984), 19-30. 43. But immemor works two ways. As lovers Dido and Aeneas were "forgetful" of their public responsibilities {Aen. 4.221, 267). See S. Wiltshire, Public and Pri vate in Vergil's Aeneid (Amherst 1989), 114-15: "Aeneas's love for Dido is real, but it is real only in the way that hers is, in the private, illusory world outside of time and responsibility." 44. Anchises was blasted by Jupiter's thunderbolt and crippled, though not killed {Aen. 2.647-9). Aeneas is literally wounded in the thigh and temporarily crip pled in Aeneid 12: cf. lines 384-7 and G. K. Galinsky, Aeneas, Sicily, and Rome</page><page sequence="41">Kenneth Reckford 41 (Princeton 1969), 28-29 and Fig. 23; my student Debbie Felton suggests that this may be a sexual wound such as befalls the Fisher-King. Would Venus then heal the wound that, in a psychological sense, she helped to create? Aeneas must, after all, beget Italian progeny. 45. Another strange erotic triangle is Amata-Turnus-Lavinia in the later books, where Amata's passionate concern for Turnus, her intended son-in-law, takes on incestuous coloring from Euripides' Hippolytus; cf. especially her suicide at Aen. 12.595-603. Her name suggests "the beloved mother." 46. See Wlosok (n. 7) 139-42: "like an Arcadian dreamland" (140); Ascanius sleeps soft... like the child o? Eclogue 4" (142); but note that this poem ends with the image of a wonderful child who will grow up "worthy of a goddess's bed." Cf. also Demeter's divine fostering of the babe Demopho?n in Homeric Hymn to Demeter, 231-41, esp. 238, en kolpoisin echousa ("holding him at her bosom/ upon her lap"), and 263-4 (he "went upon her knees and slept in her arms"). 47. For sexual connotations of gremium, see OLD, s.v. gremium, 3, and J. N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary (Baltimore 1982), 92. Montaigne, for one, was shocked and excited by the erotic power of Aen. 8. 404-6 against its Lucretian background: "... cette noble 'circumfusa', m?re du gentil 'infusus'" {Oeuvres Compl?tes, ed. A. Thibaudet &amp; Maurice Rat [Paris 1962], 850). I thank my col league, David Ganz, for this reference. 48. In his dissertation, which he kindly lent me {Mixed Praise, Sexual Imagery, Truth and Discord in Pindar's Odes [Pennsylvania 1994], 45 and n. 60, Nigel Nich olson remarks on "falling in Victory's lap" {en gounasi, Isth. 2.25-7) as a "sexual tryst." Conversely, the male victor shares suggestively in the ambiguities of love making, where the male (a) dominates through penetration, (b) is enfolded like "an impotent child" in its mother's arms (46-48). 49. See F. Klingner, Virgil (Zurich and Stuttgart 1967), 407: "in ihrem Drang, ihre eigenste Macht auszuspielen" [emphasis mine]. 50. Wlosok (n. 7), 33-43. 51. For Venus's clarity, see K. Reckford, "Helen in Aeneid 2 and 6," Arethusa 14 (1981), 89-93; for her interference in Helen's behalf, Segal (n. 24 above), 74. 52. M. Putnam, "Possessiveness, Sexuality, and Heroism in the Aeneid," Vergil ius 31 (1985), 97. Differently, W. K?hn, G?tterszenen bei Vergil (Heidelberg 1971), 123, sees Aeneas's acceptance of his calling {"Gefordertseins") as responsible for this new closeness between goddess and human. Might it also, I wonder, reflect an Achillean withdrawal from ordinary human ties? 53. Inauguration of a righteous war: Wlosok (n. 7), 123; Venus Victrix, etc: Wlo sok, 116-28. 54. J. P. Elder, "Lucretius 1.1-49," TAPA 85 (1954), 88-120, esp. 115-19. Pleas ure for Mars is "kinetic," not safe and impersonal; he enjoys, after sex, a brief moment of restored equilibrium. These comments should be seen in the context of Elder's larger discussion of the invocation to Venus in its Epicurean setting, the associations of peace and generation, the shifts and gradations oivoluptas, and the tension between kinetic and static pleasures. To those who knew him and his work, Peter Elder was a first-rate Latinist and an inspiring and generous teacher: hence, after so many years, the grateful dedication of this essay. 55. In an unpublished paper which she kindly made available to me, Eleanor Leach argues that Venus is a particularly Roman type of the helpful, attentive mother, concerned with guaranteeing that her son and his posterity will enter into their rightful inheritance.</page><page sequence="42">42 RECOGNIZING VENUS (I) : AENEAS MEETS HIS MOTHER 56. D. C. Feeney, The Gods in Epic (Oxford 1991), 129-87, warns against reduc tionist views that would glide over the supernatural or reduce it to a realistic level of meaning or of character portrayal: "The urge to read naturalistically again and again elides entire dimensions of meaning and effect" (173). The Aeneid is an "authoritative . .. fiction," with "its own achieved power, effect and truth" (186). 57.1 am grateful to Eleanor Leach, Sara Mack, and Charles Segal for their advice and encouragement, and to the members of my 1992 Latin seminar for our joint explorations of Virgil's poetry against the background of Homer.</page></plain_text>
