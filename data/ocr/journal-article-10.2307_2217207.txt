<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Theological Frontier of Ethics. By W. G. MACLAGAN. (London: Allen &amp; Unwin. 1961. Pp. 202. Price 28s). Professor Maclagan maintains that ethics stands upon its own feet; it is not dependent upon theism. He explores several possible ways of relating duty to the will of a personal God and finds that some are merely attempts to show that the universe rewards, or at least is friendly towards, moral goodness; others either end by subordin- ating theism to moral values, thereby making the former ethically superfluous, or they make a case for the contrary only by logically misusing terms such as " lawgiver ". In any case traditional theism is too anthropomorphic. The proper object of the religious attitude of reverence is not a person but the moral law and the realm of values whose existence it presupposes. These carry with them the absolute authority we attribute to God, and it is the author's conviction that in fact they are God. The response required of man is the sincere endeavour, first to discover what his duty is, and, second, to set himself to do it. Here again orthodox theology presents diffi- culties, for when we pray for grace we are seldom if ever aware of another power im- manent in our will, and the supposition that God does so act unobservably conflicts with the doctrine of free-will; it makes a man no longer a person but simply a mode of the divine being. In Professor Maclagan's own view the prayer for enablement is not really petition at all, but resolution expressed as petition, " a willed attentiveness to the nature of the demand upon us ". In the same way a prayer for forgiveness is essentially an expression of penitence; to interpret it more literally is to think of sin as an injury to God, but an impersonal God has no interests and cannot therefore be injured. As several of these arguments might be rebutted by appeal to the scholastic doctrine of analogy, the author's discussion of this topic has an importance out of proportion to its length. He apologizes for its brevity, but explains he finds himself unable to attach meaning to analogies in which one thing does not literally duplicate character- istics of another: it is not enough that it should merely suggest or symbolize them. It would seem to follow (though no such inference is expressly drawn) that symbol and metaphor have no indispensable r6le to play in religious language or action, and any- thing that can be said in theology can (by the standards of ordinary language) be said clearly. The writer says emphatically he has no wish to reduce religion to morality, but only to claim the moral consciousness is itself a mode of religious consciousness. Still, the orthodox will hardly be satisfied with that. They will want to know what else the impersonal God is besides duty and values. Then, they will ask, isn't it an analogy of the proscribed sort. or worse, to speak of petitionary praver when what you mean in plain English is penitence or resolution ? And isn't sanctity represented here, Stoic- wise, as something which any reallv determined individual can achieve for himself, rather than a disposition that no one could ever acquire outside a community permeated by the Holy Spirit ? So one may object, but Maclagan's own objections remain to be answered. How precisely do we conceive the operation of divine grace, and how is it compatible with human freedom ? There are of course senses of " free " in which the difficulty can be met. No doubt, to be the willing slave of God, to make one's whole life and person nothing but a passive instrument of his activity, is for the saint a goal which he freely wills. (One might compare the case of the Hebrew prophets, with their overpowering sense that the words issuing from their mouths are none of their own). Yet when the ordinary man acknowledges his moral failure and prays for grace, he does in a way seem to be asking God to do what God asks of him. Fifteen centuries of theological discussion prove the problem is real enough. A book of this kind is bound to make certain presuppositions, e.g. about the psv- chology of the will, without arguing for them, and some readers may find some of Pro- fessor Maclagan's conclusions not proven, simply because they cannot accept these premises. The book deals very convincingly with a variety of common misconceptions, such as, that " duty-ethics " is a harsh Puritanical doctrine that leaves love out, or again that theologians need not always be logical. I need hardly add that it is a model of lucid exposition. Gl. D. DUTETIE</page></plain_text>
