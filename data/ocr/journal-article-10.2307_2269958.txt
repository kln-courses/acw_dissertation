<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF SYmBoLic LoGic Volume 36, Number 3, Sept. 1971 EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITHMETIC ROHIT PARIKH "From two integers k, 1 one passes immediately to k1; this process leads in a few steps to numbers which are far larger than any occurring in experience, e.g., 67(257729) Intuitionism, like ordinary mathematics, claims that this number can be repre- sented by an arabic numeral. Could not one press further the criticism which intuitionism makes of existential assertions and raise the question: What does it mean to claim the existence of an arabic numeral for the foregoing number, since in practice we are not in a position to obtain it? Brouwer appeals to intuition but one can doubt that the evidence for it really is intuitive. Isn't this rather an application of the general method of analogy, con- sisting in extending to inaccessible numbers the relations which we can concretely verify for accessible numbers?'" Our primary motive in this paper will be to look into the question of feasibility or concreteness of functions and procedures. We shall look at the primitive recur- sive functions in general and exponentiation in particular and show that questions already arise (Theorem 1.4) in 3 of Grzegorczyk which are not feasibly decidable in ZF. (Here 3 is the level corresponding to the function e(x, y) = xy.) We shall also show (Theorem 2.2) that formal systems in which "large" numbers are treated as if they were infinite give correct results for all proofs of reasonable length. Here "feasible" and "reasonable length" are intuitive notions and we appeal to the reader's common sense to agree that a proof with over 101000 symbols is not itself feasible, though it might be possible to give a feasible description of it. All these considerations have a certain bearing for the foundations of mathe- matics. In the formalist2 view of mathematics, finitist statements play a role similar to that played in a scientific theory by experimental data. Thus in an infinitistic system (like Peano arithmetic or. analysis) which includes finitist statements as a proper part, the other formulae play the role of theoretical or ideal statements whose primary purpose is to smooth out things and to provide short cuts in reasoning. The role of experimental verification will be played either by straight calculation, or equally satisfactorily, finitist proof. Received June 15, 1970, revised March 1, 1971. 1 Cf. Bernays in [B2, pp. 280-281]. A similar criticism has been made more recently by Esenine Volpin in a more systematic way. However, his methods of investigation are his own and we have preferred the more conservative approach of using "standard" methods for our technical proofs. 2 Cf. Hilbert in [H, p. 134ff].

Then we have: (i) A' is verifiable i.e. A' can be checked by calculation, and, by finitist methods, FA' or -A'. (ii) T is a "correct" theory iff for every A e F, if T F A then A is valid. A pleasant fact is that (ii) may be replaced by (iia) If T is consistent, T = PA (Peano arithmetic with S, ) T A and A e F, then A is valid, or equivalently (iib) If T 2 PA, T F A, A e F and A is not valid then T is inconsistent. Thus consistency is sufficient to ensure correctness. What is important from our point of view is that the conclusion in (i) and (iib) is existential. In the one case we are promised a proof of A' or of - A' and in the other case, a proof of a contradition. Now if we impose the requirement that the proofs described just above be feasible, then it follows from our Theorems 1.4 and 2.2 that the class F is too large. It is not possible, in practice, to decide equations between variable free primitive recursive terms. Also interesting theories may differ from conventional mathe- matics on F, and yet have no contradiction which we need worry about coming across in real life. (Here we use the fact that F contains primitive recursive arith- metic.) In ?3 we give an argument to show that in models of Peano arithmetic, exponen- tiation is not fixed by its (primitive recursive) defining equations. All this would tend to give some weight to the contentions that there is a definite concrete or anthropomorphic point of view possible in mathematics and that expo- nentiation would be excluded by this view as a genuine computable function. In ?4 we put forward the view that practical computability is more closely asso- ciated with the DLBA's of Myhill and Kuroda than with arbitrary Turing machines. We formulate a subsystem of Peano arithmetic which is related to the anthropomorphic viewpoint and investigate some of its properties. We are indebted to the referee for a proof of Theorem 4.4 and for an improved proof of Theorem 2.2. ?1. Exponentiation and the length of proofs. Throughout this paper the length of a proof will be the number of symbols in it. Thus there are only finitely many proofs of length ? k. PA will always mean Peano arithmetic with S, +, *, and full induction. In this section, T is a consistent r.e. theory containing PA. If A is a for- mula P(A) is the formula that says "A is provable in T". Specifically, if rS1, -A- are the Gi3del numbers of S, A, respectively and B(rSl, rAn) is the formula that says: " S is a proof of A in T", then P(A) is the formula (3x)B(x, -A-). B is assumed to satisfy the regularity conditions of ULb. We define Pk(A) recursively as p(pk- l(A)). PO(A) is A. THEOREM 1 ,1. If T is w-consistent and T F Con (T) --. P(A) then T F A where Con (T) is the formula -,P(O = 1). PROOF. Clearly T F -,Con (T) -- P(A). Hence T F P(A). By c-consistency, T F A. Q.E.D.</page><page sequence="3">496 ROHIT PARIKH THEOREM 1.2. There is a primitive recursive function f such that if A has a proof of length ? n then P(A) has a proof of length ? f(n). PROOF. Intuitively obvious. The proof of P(A) simply consists of checking out within T that the sequence of length ? n which is a proof of A is in fact a proof of A. This yields a proof of P(A). Q.E.D. THEOREM 1.3. Let g be any primitive recursive function. For all k there is a formula A and a number n, such that there is a proof of Pk(A) of length S n but for no i &lt; k is there a proof of Pi(A) of length &lt; g(n). PROOF. First we sketch the intuitive argument for the case k = 1. Let A(p) be a formula that says "I don't have a proof of length 'p" where p is a number to be specified later. Now if T is consistent, then A(p) cannot have a proof of length _p. On the other hand: * If A(p) does not have a proof then A(p) is true, and then A(p) will have a proof which is essentially a check that A(p) is true. Thus -,P(A(p)) -+ P(A(p)). Hence P(A(p)). * The argument between *'s can be formalised to give a reasonably short proof of P(A(p)) of length, say m. All we need now is to have picked p such that p &gt; g(m). Now we give details of the proof for the sample case where k = 3. Let B(x, y) be the formula representing the proof relation: B(rSl, 'A-) iff S is a sequence and A is a formula and S is a proof of A. We assume that B has the properties mentioned by Lobb [L]. Consider some enumeration {it} of all primitive recursive functions of one variable. Let the formula A(x, y, z) represent f(i, n) = Oj(n) and such that T F (Vx)(Vy)( ! z)A(x, y, z). (There is a provably recursive function of PA which enumerates all p.r. functions, so A exists.) Let D(u, v, w) be the formula that says: if u is the G6del number of a formula F(x) then w is the G6del number of F(v), otherwise w = 0. (Here v is the numeral SV(0).) Finally let E(u, v) be the formula that says: if u is the Godel number of A then v is the G6del number of P(A) (i.e. of (3y)(B(y, u))), otherwise v = 0. Now define Ci(x) to be the formula (Vu, v, w, y, z, m)(D(x, x, u) A E(u, v) A E(v, w) A B(y, z) A (z = u V z = v V z = w) A A(i, x, m) -*y &gt; m). Ci(x) says: If m = b t(x) and x is the Godel number of A then there is no proof with G6del number ? im of A or P(A) or P(P(A)). Now let ki = G6del number of C1(x) and let Ct = C1(k1). Then Ci says: I don't have, and neither do P(Ci') and P(P(C1')) have, a proof of Godel number _ Oj(kj). * Now P3(C1') is certainly true. For if C' or P(Ci') or P(P(Cj')) have a proof at all, then P2(Cj') has a proof. (Since P(A) _* P2(A) is always true) i.e. P3(Ct') holds. If none of these have a proof, then, of course, Cj' is true and has a proof by checking, since C1' makes a statement that is checkable. So in any case P3(C1') is true. * Now the argument between the *'s can be formalised within T to show that P3(C,') is true for all i. Specifically, there is a formula G(i, y) representing the func-</page><page sequence="4">EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITHMETIC 497 tionf(i) = rP2(Cy)' and such that T F (Vx)(3 !y)G(x, y) and T F (Vx)(Vy)(G(x, y) -* (3z)B(z, y)). This gives us a primitive recursive function f such that if m = rCr" thenfi(m) is the Godel number of a proof of P3(C'). Letf2 be the (primitive recursive) function such that f2(r) is the largest possible Godel number of a sequence of r symbols. (We assume a finite alphabet.) And now let i be such that pi(x) = f2(g(jf(x))) for all x. Then C1' is the required formula. Q.E.D. Remark. Clearly Theorem 1.3 holds if g is a provably recursive function of T. Instead of all primitive recursive functions we use all g-primitive recursive functions. On the other hand, for T = PA, take g(n) = Sup {length of shortest proof of A: P(A) has a proof with &lt; n symbols}. Then g is recursive and Theorem 1.3 does not hold for it. COROLLARY TO THEOREM 1.3. Let T1 be an extension of T such that the &amp;u- consistency ofT can be proved in T. g a primitive recursive function. Then there exists a formula A and a proof of A in T1 of length ? n such that A has no proof in T of length ?g(n). PROOF. It is enough to notice that the formula (Vn) (if T F PT(A) then T F A where n is the Godel number of A) is provable in T1. Hence the proof of PT(A) in T, is not much longer than the proof of P2(A) in T. Now apply Theorem 1.3. Q.E.D. DEFINITION 1.1. The primitive recursive functions are the smallest class of functions obtained from the constant function 0, successor and the In(In(Xi - - Xn) = X0) by composition and primitive recursion. Let the complexity of 0 and successor be 1, that of Ii = n and if f is obtained from g1,* *, gn by composition or primitive recursion then complexity c(f) off = max (c(gj), . *, c(gn)) + 1. THEOREM 1.4. There is a p.r. term t of small complexity3 such that there is no proof within ZF with &lt;e(lO, e(10, 10)) symbols of the formula A:t 0, - A, or for any k of any formula Pk(A) or Pk( -,A). PROOF. Let h(x, y) be the primitive recursive function such that h(x, y) = 0 if x is the Godel number of a formula A and there is a proof with my symbols of A, or Pk(A) for any k, = 1 otherwise. Let g(u, v) = the Goddel number of A(v) if u is the Godel number of a formula A(x), = 0 otherwise. Let B'(u, v) be the formula representing the predicate h(u, v) = 0 and let D(u, v, w) represent g(u, v) = w and let E(u, v, w) represent e(u, v) = w. Let A(x) be the formula (Vu)(Vv)(Vw)(D(x, x, w) A E(10, 10, u) A E(10, u, v) -m -,B'(w, v)). 3 The complexity is somewhere between 10 and 100. Standard texts carry out such definitions in a sequence of 4-5 pages. Note that the result is unaffected if ZF is augmented by standard metatheorems like the deduction theorem or introducing notions by definitions. This is because it can be proved in ZF that the augmented theory is not actually larger. Hence a proof of P(A) in ZF will not be much longer than a proof of A in the augmented system.</page><page sequence="5">498 ROHIT PARIKH Let 0 be a term whose value I 91 is the Godel number of A(x). And now take t to be the term h(g(9, 0), e(10, e(10, 10))). The formula A with Godel number g(j 01, I O1) says " neither A nor any Pk(A) has a proof with &lt; e(10, e(10, 10)) symbols". If ZF is w-consistent, the formula is true and hence neither A nor --A nor any Pk(A) nor any Pk( -,A) has a proof with &lt; e(10, e(10, 10)) symbols. Now clearly a proof with &gt; e(10, e(10, 10)) symbols cannot be regarded as feasible. Thus it cannot really be decided in ZF whether t = O or t # O. Q.E.D. COROLLARY. In Theorem 1.4 the same result holds if the initial functions include I,, S, 0, +, e and primitive recursion is replaced by the bounded ,u- operator. PROOF. This much apparatus is sufficient for defining Godel numbers and the various metamathematical notions. Note that the corollary would not hold if we did not have exponentiation. Not only could we no longer denote such large numbers with short terms, what is more essential, we could not assign Godel numbers using just the remaining functions. LEMMA 1.1. Let F be the smallest family of functions containing S, 0, +, *, It and closed under composition and the bounded c-operator. Then for each function f E F there is a polynomial P such that f (X1 ... Xn) &lt; P(x *...x) for all xl, * , xn. PROOF. Trivial. All the initial functions satisfy the condition, it is preserved under composition and if g is obtained from f by the bounded P-operation, then g(X1, * ' ' , Xn, Y) = (fix &lt; Yf(X1 **, Xn, X) = 0]} &lt; y for all x1, * * *, x,, y. Q.E.D. To see why exponentiation is needed to do the metatheory of arithmetic within arithmetic, assume that we have a Godel numbering g, for terms and formulae such that shorter expressions receive smaller Godel numbers. Now let f(m, n) = Goddel number of A(n) where m is the Godel number of A(x). LEMMA 1.2. For every k, there are infinitely many m, n such that f(m, n) &gt; (max (m, n))k. PROOF. By considering boolean combinations of 0 = 0 and 0 # 0 we see that there are over 2" formulae of length 12n. Thus the Godel number of an expression of length m will be at least 2m112. Now if A(x) has length I there could be 1/3 occur- rences of x in it and hence A(m) has length of the order of ml. Hence its Godel number would be over 2m1112 i.e. (n)t where n is the GMdel number of A(x). A more precise argument would be boring. Q.E.D. Thus exponentiation is not only a means for denoting "large numbers" but also the means for introducing "nonmathematical" questions into number theory. Why do we say " nonmathematical" ? Because consider Godel's formula A which says "I am not provable". Now this formula does express properties of N, since it can be written with quantifiers and connectives. However to see that A is true but not provable, we do not use properties of N, but properties of the intuitive notion provablele. Thus to say that A is a statement about numbers is like arguing that</page><page sequence="6">EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITHMETIC 499 human behaviour is a problem of physics since human beings are physical entities. Even if such an assertion is true, it is very theoretical and not very useful. Open question. It follows from results in [Pa] that nonstandard formal theories are conservative extensions of their standard parents. Is there, nonetheless, a decrease in length of proofs? Such a saving will be small, of course, for theories like PA where models of finite subtheories can be constructed. (Cf. [Kr,].) ?2. Almost consistent theories. Throughout this section PA+ will mean the theory obtained from PA by adding symbols and defining equations for all primitive recursive functions. THEoREM 2.1. Let T be a consistent theory, T 2 PA+. Add to T the symbol F (feasible) and the axioms (a) F(O), (b) (Vx)Vy)(F(x) A F(y) -+ (F(S(x)) A F(x + y) A F(x y))), (c) (Vx)(Vy)(F(x) A y &lt; X -F(y)) (d) (3x)(3y)(F(x) A F(y) A -nF(e(x, y))). Then the resulting theory T1 is a conservative extension of T. PROOF. We show first that if T2 is an extension of T in the same language, then T1 u T2 is consistent. For let M be a nonstandard model of T2. (I.e. M # N.) Pick a e {MI, a infinite and define F(x) +-+ (3 standard n)(x &lt; an). Then M, F is a model of T1 u T2. Now suppose there were a formula A in the language of T such that T1 F A and T M A. Then we could pick T2 such that T2 I- -A, and T1 u T2 could not be con- sistent. Q.E.D. Now we look into the possibility of replacing infinite numbers by large finite numbers denoted by primitive recursive terms. DEFINITION 2.1. e*(r, n) is the rth iterate of the function e(2, n). Specifically e*(O, n) = n, e*(r + 1, n) = e(2, e*(r, n)). DEFINITION 2.2. Let T PA +. T1 is obtained from Tby adding the symbol Fand the axioms: (i) F(O), (ii) F(x) -*F(S(x)), (m) x = y -+ (F(x) -* F(y)), (iv) F(x) A y &lt; x -&gt;F(y), (v) -nF(O), where B is some fixed variable free primitive recursive term. The value 1I1 of 0 is m. Since we shall be talking about the structure of proofs we should remark on the formalisation of the LPC which we use. We shall assume that this formalization has some (correct) axioms and rules regarding the propositional calculus and equa- lity. The only quantifier axioms are of the form A(t) -. (3x)A(x) (t free for x in A) and the only quantifier rule is existential generalisation. (The proof will hold-with amendments-if the dual axioms and rule for V are included.) DEFINITION 2.3. Given a proof P in T1 which is written in tree form (each for- mula is used in only one inference) we consider axioms A(t) -&gt; (3x)A(x) where F occurs in A. Then the F-complexity of P = c(P) = the number of these axioms.</page><page sequence="7">500 ROHIT PARIKH F-rank of P = r(P) = the largest number of quantifiers occurring in any for- mula A above. THEOREM 2.2a. Let P be a proof in T1 of the closed formula B. B does not contain F. r(P) = r, c(P) = k and P contains n occurrences of the axiom F(x) -? F(S(x)). Moreover m &gt; no e*(r, Jk(k + 1)). Then T F B. We first need some notions from the E-calculus. DEFINITION 2.4. The terms of the E-calculus are just like the terms of T1 except for the additional closure condition: If A(x) is a formula containing no bound occurrences of x then exA(x) is a term. DEFINITION 2.5. We define a map + on the formulae of T1 + E-calculus as follows: (1) If A is quantifier free then A+ = A. (2) (-,A)+= (A+) (3) (A V B)+ = A+ V B+ (similarly for other propositional connectives). (4) ((3x)A(x))+ = A +(sxA +(x)). If we replace every formula A in the proof P by A + we get a proof P + of B+ in the s-calculus. P + contains no quantifiers, and there are k axioms of the form A(t) --&gt;. A(exA(x)). We call these the critical formulae of the proof P +. The exA(x) are the critical terms. Truth functional rules of P become truth functional rules of P +, generalisation becomes substitution for free variables. Since we have no free variables in B+, every free variable occurring in P + is eventually substituted for. If we carry out these substitutions from the start, we can assume wlog that P + con- tains no free variables. Throughout P +, replace every e-matrix4 not containing Fby the corresponding Skolem function, interpreting E as the p-operator. Now we have a proof, which we still call P +, containing k critical formulae A(t) -. A(exA(x)) with A containing F, the highest rank of these E-terms is r. All the axioms other than the critical formulae will hold as soon as values are assigned to the s-terms con- taining F. PROOF OF THEOREM 2.2a. We trace out the proof of the first E-theorem ([HB2, pp. 9-29], [Bl, pp. 72-87]) and keep track of the growth of the proof as the various critical terms are eliminated. Suppose these are p E-terms of rank r which contain F and which have b critical formulae. Arrange the terms in order of descending grade and let the ith term e, have b i critical formulae. Then b = Hi= 1 bi.There are k - b critical formulae of rank &lt; r. Suppose we eliminate the critical formulae C1 of el as follows. Let them be A(t1) -+ A(el), ? * *, A(tq) -&gt;. A(el) where q = bl. Let Pi be the proof obtained from P + by replacing el by ti throughout. Then Pi is a correct proof of B+ from the hypothesis A(t1). The formulae corresponding to C1 need no longer be axioms. They are consequences of A(ti). Thus corresponding to the assumption A(t) we have a proof Pi. We also have a proof Pq+ 1 which is the same as P + except that the formulae C1 are consequences of the assumption 4 The notions we use, like rank, grade, e-matrix, can be found defined in [HB2], [W], [BJ] and [T]. [BI, pp. 72-87] contains the clearest explanation of the first e-theorem.</page><page sequence="8">EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITHMETIC 501 -nP(t1) A .** A -,P(t). Combining the proofs Pi: i ? q + 1, and using the tauto- logy A(t1) V .. V A(tq) V (-,A(t1) A ... A /\ A(tq)) we get a proof without the critical formulae C1. However, we may have more critical terms of rank &lt; r and while the number of terms of rank r is unchanged, each ej for i &gt; 1 may now have as many as (bi + 1)bi critical formulae. Thus when all the critical formulae of rank r are eliminated, we have a proof of rank r - 1 and with critical formulae numbering no more than ki = (k - b){(b1 + 1)}{(bl + 1)(b2 + 1)}{(b1 + l)(b2 + l)(b3 + 1.... {(bq + l)} (k - b)J(1 + bi)(q+l-) = (k - b).Mo. The highest possible value of MO occurs when each bi = 1, i.e. the value e(2, J(q + l)q) = e(2, 4b(b + 1)). If k = b then k, = 0. Otherwise b _ k - 1 and we get. k1 &lt;- e(2, Jk(k + 1)) = e*(1, +k(k + 1)). When all the critical formulae are eliminated after r steps, the entire proof has been multiplied by a factor of e*(r, j(k + l)k)). Hence there are &lt; m axioms of the form F(t) -+ F(S(t)). Say they are F(t4) -* F(S(t4)), i = 0O,. * , p. Now one can prove in T, m-i p V Ati#n. n=O i-i Hence the proof with F(x) replaced by x ? n becomes sound with the hypothesis At= 1tt # n.

Let T2 be obtainedfrom T1 above by adding the axioms (vi) F(x) A F(y) F(x + y), (vii) F(x) A F(y) F(x y). Let P be a proof of B, B closed, not containing F, the rank of P = r, c(P) = k and P contains n occurrences of the axioms (ii), (vi), (vii). If m &gt; e*(2, e*(r,j Jk(k + 1)).n) then T F B. PROOF.

Also, the proof, with F(x) replaced by (31)(j &lt; i A x E A&gt;) becomes a sound proof from the hypothesis Ai r) B = 0 (written, of course, in a first order way). Com- bining these two, we get a proof in T of B. Q.E.D.</page><page sequence="9">502 ROHIT PARIKH Of course it is very easy to derive a model theoretic argument, assuming the standard N to be a model of T, that large numbers act like infinite ones. Here, however, such large numbers are obtained as values of primitive recursive terms. ?3. A model theoretic result. It is one of the basic results of early proof theory that the function e(x, y) can be defined in PA. Specifically there is a formula A(x, y, z) such that F (Vx)(Vy)(3! z)A(x, y, z) and for all m, n, p such that e(m, n) = p, FI A(m, n, y) *-+ y = p. Cf. [HB, vol. I]. However, there is a sense in which exponentiation is not elementarily definable in terms of S, +,. DEFINITION 3.1. Given a function symbol, let A(f) be the formula (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)(f(x, 0) = 1 A f (x, S(y)) = f(x, y).x A f(x, y + z) = f(x, y).f(x, z) A f(x, yz) = f(f(x, y), z))). Clearly A(f) says that f has all the usual properties of exponentiation. Let N = &lt;N, 0, S, +, * &gt; be the usual model. Let T = Th(N). THEOREM 3.1. With T as above there is a model N* of T and two binary functions f,gonN* toN*such thatf # gbutN*,f IA(f)andN*,g IA(g). PROOF. By Ehrenfeucht and Mostowski [EM] there exists a model N* of T which has a nontrivial automorphism qb. Let f be the "usual" exponential function on N* defined by a first order formula involving S, +, * Clearly N*, f I A(f). Now let g(x, y) = f(x, i(y)). Claim N*, g 1 A(g). E.g. g(x, yz) = f(x, O(yz)) = f(x, +(y)+(z)) = f(f(x, +(y)), #(z)) = f(g(x, y) #(Z)) = g(g(x, y), z). Thus A(g) holds. But f # g. Q.E.D. Of course both f(x, n) and g(x, n) will have to equal x" for standard n. But it seems that if y is nonstandard then in calculating xv we might "lose track" of how many times we multiplied x by itself. It is easy to see that if N* is obtained from a model of analysis then g cannot be internal, since f(xo, yo) # g(x0, yo) implies that the set {y: f(xo, y) # g(xo, y)} has no least element. Thus it would seem that, in a way, primitive recursion is not elementary but a second order notion. ?4. An anthropomorphic system. It is clear that the unrestricted use of exponen- tiation cannot be regarded as having a concrete meaning. However, even multi- plication can be used to denote fairly large numbers. Can we then pin down how much of number theory is "concrete"? The answer to this question depends on existing computer technology and may be mathematically uninteresting. In any case we shall not attempt to answer it here. We start instead by considering a criticism of "justification of induction" which is (the criticism is) originally due to Poincar6. Suppose that we know A(O) and</page><page sequence="10">EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITHMETIC 503 (Vx)(A(x) -. A(S(x))) and want to justify (Vx)(A(x)) without resorting to induction. We argue as follows: We clearly have a proof of A(0). Suppose now that we have a proof of A(n). To this we adjoin A(n) -- A(S((n))) and apply modus ponens, then we have a proof of A(n + 1). Thus we can prove A(n) for every n. Hence (Vx)A(x). The fallacy, of course, is that in order to justify induction on A, we are now using induction on another predicate, call it B(n). B(n): there exists a proof of A(n). Our argument simply said: B(O), (Vn)(B(n) -+ B(n + 1)). Hence (Vn)B(n). What is interesting from our point of view is that arbitrary induction can be reduced to induction on existential formulae (together with the reflection principle (Vn) Prov (A(n)) -+ (Vn)A(n)). It is also induction on existential formulae that leads within Peano arithmetic to a justification of primitive recursion. Thus we cannot accept induction on arbitrary existential formulae. DEFINITION 4.1. A formula A of arithmetic is bounded if it is of the form (QlXl &lt; tl)(Q2x2 &lt; t2). (QnXn &lt; tn)B(xl... xny, ...y.) where Q1, * * * , Qn are V or 3, each tm is a term containing the yi, the x,: j &lt; m, 0 and the function symbols S, +, * only, and B is quantifier free. For the next result we shall assume the reader is familiar with the linear bounded automata of Myhill (called Dlba's in [Ku]). DEFINITION 4.2. Let h denote the arabic numeral denoting n. Thus e.g. if p is the sixth prime then f is just the sequence " 17". THEoREM 4.15. Let E(yl,--.- , y) with free variables Yl,-.- , ym be bounded. Then there exists a diba D such that D accepts the sequence #/i * H2 * ... * *Hn/ iff E(n1, * * ,n I m) is true. (The set of such sequences will be called the graph of E.) PROOF. Entirely routine, by induction on the length of E. Given a dlba D, let AD = the set of sequences accepted by D. Let F = the family of all such AD. Then F is closed under boolean operations [Ku] and contains the graphs of the functions plus and times. Since the formula E can be written in terms of the predicates P(x, y, z) *-- x + y = z and M(x, y, z) *-&gt; x y = z, it is sufficient to show that bounded existential quantifiers can be evaluated by a Dlba. However, if E(yl, - * * , ym) * (3x &lt; t)El(yl, * * * , yms x) where t is dependent only on the yj, and D1 recognises the graph of E1, then we can construct a Dlba D which recognises the graph of E, namely it generates the arabic numerals x with x less than the value of t and for each x it asks D1 whether the sequence #Yi * Y2 *... * * # is acceptable. Since the maximum possible length of such an X depends linearly on the lengths 51,, 5** , such a Dlba D works. Q.E.D. 6 Professor Stephen Cook has pointed out that from the results of Ritchie [R] it follows that the class of concrete functions equals Grzegorczyk's 2. Theorems 4.1, 4.2 also follow from results in [RJ.</page><page sequence="11">504 ROHIT PARIKH We are unable to say whether the converse to Theorem 4.1 is true or not. How- ever, the following definition seems very plausible. DEFINITION 4.3. A number theoretic predicate P(nl, * * *, nm) is concrete If there exists a diba D such that D accepts #ft, *... * * im# iffP(nl, * * *, fn) is true. A number theoretic function f(nl, . * *, nm) is concrete iff the predicate R(ni, .. * * nm+,) -f(ni,, * * n.) -n,+1 is concrete and there exists a polynomial P such that for all n1, , n., 'f(nl,, * * n.) 59 P(ni, * * * , n.). THEOREM 4.2. (a) The concrete predicates are closed under conjunction, disjunc- tion, negation and bounded quantification. (b) For each n, the predicate Tn(z, xi, * xn, y) is concrete. (c) The concrete functions include S, + and are closed under composition. (d) The function e(x, y) is not concrete. PROOF. Entirely routine. A predicate or function is concrete iff there is a Turing machine Z and fixed a, b such that (a) Z computes the function/predicate. (b) The total amount of tape used during the entire calculation is bounded by as i + b where i is the length of the input. It is interesting to note that the predicate P(x, y, z): x = z is concrete. However, we do not have (Vx)(Vy)(3z)(xy = z) since, for x, y feasible, z might not be feasible. It also turns out that it is quite possible for the function U(pyT(z, x, y)) to be con- crete where uyT(z, x, y) is not concrete. This corresponds intuitively to a situation where it is feasible to compute an answer by a method which involves erasing parts of the intermediate calculations, and this erasure is not avoidable. Why do we use arabic notation to denote numbers? The reason is that this nota- tion is the most efficient possible which also "leaves our feet on the ground". Thus if we have ten digits and space, we should be able to denote 11k numbers at most, with sequences of length &lt; k, whereas with arabic notation we can denote 10. We also have length (imif) = l(ffiui) &lt; l(ifm) + I(n) 1(m + n) &lt; max (l(mf), I(n)) + 1. If we denoted n by a sequence of n + 1 l's, then multiplication would not be concrete. On the other hand, if we allowed expressions with exponential terms like 3749, we could denote large numbers, but smaller numbers would not always have shorter notations and hence the set of numbers denoted by feasible expressions would not be a segment of N. Hence induction would no longer be justified. Thus arabic notation is the most powerful notation that is also concrete. DEFINITION 4.4. The subsystem PB of PA has the following axioms: (1) 0 # S(x) (5) x + S(y) = S(x + y) (2) S(x) = S(y) -x = y (6) x.O = 0 (3) x = 0 V (3y)(x = S(y)) (7) x-S(y) = x-y + x (4) x + 0 = x (8n) A(O) A (Vx)(A(x) --A(S(x)))- (Vx)A(x) where A(x) is a bounded formula, possibly with free variables other than x.</page><page sequence="12">EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITMETC 505 THEOREM 4.3. The existence of an exponential function cannot be proved in PB. Specifically, there is no formula A(x, y, z) such that F (Vx)(Vy)(3 !z)A(x, y, z), I (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)(A(x, 0, 1) A (A(x, y, z) -+ A(x, S(y), x * z))). PROOF. Take a nonstandard model -N &lt;N*, 0, , +, *&gt; of PA. Let aeN* - Nand let A = {x: 3 standard k such that x &lt; ak}. Let M be the substructure of N* with base set A. Clearly axioms (l)-{7) hold in M. To see that axiom (8) holds, we note first that bounded formulae have the same meaning in M and N*. I.e. if C(y, * * *, Ym) is bounded and a, ... am e A then M 1 C(l *... am) iff N* C(a. *...* am). Suppose now that M f C(A, Y2. * * *, Ym) and M 1 (Vx)(C(x, Y2, ..., Y.) - C(S(x), Y2, * Y.))- Let a, ... am c A and let 8 &gt; al, 8 e A. Then we have, N* C(O, a,* ,am) V 8 &lt; O and N* 1 (Vx)((C(x, as,, am) V 8 &lt; x) -* (C(S(x), a2, * , am) V 8 &lt; S(x))). Hence N* 1 C(a1, -. , am) V 8 &lt; a,, i.e. N* 1 C(al ... am) hence M 1 C(al... am). Hence M 1 PB. Suppose now there is a formula A which defines an exponential function in M. There exists a ,B e A such that M P A(a, a, ,B). There is a standard k such that P &lt; a k. But there is also a y such that M I A(a, a k, y) and y # 0. Hence fi = y ak &gt; 1 ak. Contradiction. THEOREM 4.4. If A(x, y) is a bounded formula with no additional free variables, then if (Vx)(3y)A(x, y) is provable in PB, then for some k, l(Vx)(3y)(y &lt; x" + I A A(x, y)) is provable in PB, with xc being written out as x times itself k times. PROOF. First add to PB, recursion equations for the functions 8, *, y: 8(0) = 0, S(Sx) = x, x- *0=0O x * Sy = 8(x *y), y(x,y, 0) = x, Yx,y, Sx) =y. Then any propositional combination of equations can be proved without quanti- fied inductions to be equivalent to one of the form t = 0. s = t is rendered y(s t , 1, t * s) = 0. We derive successively, (1) x - y= 8(Sx - y), (2) Sx -- x = SO, (3) x * x = 0, (4) X y-*(x - y =O0 A y x = 0), (5) y X = 0 - x y + (x Y), (6) X y = 0 A y x = 0-x =y, (7) (x = 0-.A) -(Y(1,OX) = 0+-+ -,A), (8) {((x = 0) " A) A (y = 0 B)} -*{y(y, lX)4-+A A B}.</page><page sequence="13">506 ROHMT PARKH Now for each t with free variables xj,***, xn, x, introduce it with the defin- ing equations t(X, * *, xw, 0) = 0, t(xl, * ?, x, Sx) = y[Ot(Xi, * * *, x,, x), Sx, t(x, ... *, x, t(x, *, x))] so that we have (suppressing the parameters): (9) t(#(x)) = 0 -* #(Sx) =i , (10) t(#(x)) # -*#(Sx) = Sx, (11) t(y) = 0 A y &lt; x-t(#(x)) = 0 A +(x) &lt; x, (1 2) y &lt; qb(x) *t (y) 0 O. (13) (3y &lt; x)(t(y) = O) + t(#(x)) = 0A +(x) &lt; x again without quantified inductions. Thus in the resulting system, called PB', induction on bounded formulae can be reduced to the induction rule on quantities free formulae, for to prove the induction axiom on A(x), it suffices to give a quantities free equivalent of A(O) A (Vy &lt; x)(A(y) -* A(Sy)) -* A(x) and apply the induction rule to it. By Herbrand's theorem and the closure of the system under definition by cases, if A is a bounded formula and (Vx)(3y)A(x, y) is provable, then there is term t(x) such that A(x, t(x)) is provable. Now we can show that if t is a term with free variables among x1, - x,* , then there are k, I such that t &lt; {max (x1, *,xn)}k + I is provable in PB'. This is easy by induction on the construction of t. The theorem follows from the fact that PB' is a conservative extension of PB. Q.E.D. Theorems 4.3, 4.4 make it very unlikely that the G6del incompleteness and unde- cidability theorems can be proved in PB. However, PB is stronger than Shepherd- son's arithmetic with open induction, the system T6 of [S ]. It is quite routine to see that the usual proof of the irrationality of V2 can be carried out in PB. Taking feasibility seriously has implications for undecidability results. If T is decidable then there is a Turing machine Z which decides the theorems of T. If T is undecidable then for every Z, there is a formula A such that Z gives no answer or the wrong answer for A. However, in the first case, we may be interested in the existence of a feasible machine operating in reasonable amount of time and in the other case, given a machine, we may want a feasible formula for which it gives the wrong answer. Thus decidability-undecidability results proved by classical methods may not have any practical meaning. What is even more basic is the effect on Church's thesis. One may still accept recursive = effective but would not accept the classical proof that primitive recur- sive c recursive. Rather the class of provably recursive functions of PB or the con- crete functions of Definition 4.3 may have more claim to be the class of effective functions. Open question. Since the Gbdel incompleteness theorems seem to be non- concrete, the following question may be raised. Does there exist a model X* = &lt;N*, S, +, *, 0&gt; of PA such that X* F P(con (PA)) and a segment A of N* such that A is closed under addition and multiplication, there is a proof of</page><page sequence="14">EXISTENCE AND FEASIBILITY IN ARITHMETIC 507 Con (PA) whose (infinite) Godel number is in A and there is no proof of 0 = 1 whose Gbdel number is in A? It is relevant to point out here that for the set of theorems to be deductively closed, the set B = {n: n &lt; the number of inference in some proof} needs to be closed under addition and the set A = {n: n ' the G6del number of some proof} needs to be closed under multiplication too. Since there is a clear sense in which exponentiation is independent of addition and multiplication, it might be possible to have deductive closure without the G6del theorems having to hold. ?5. Conclusion. Does the Bernays' number 67(2577"') actually belong to every set which contains 0 and is closed under the successor function? The conventional answer is yes but we have seen that there is a very large element of phantasy in conventional mathematics which one may accept if one finds it pleasant, but which one could equally sensibly (perhaps more sensibly) reject. Suppose we are given two sets N1, N2 which contain 0, are "closed under suc- cessor" and are "well ordered" and such that N1 is a proper subset of N2. One feels at once that N2 cannot be well ordered (in the sense of the word) and that structures like N2 arise because "well ordered" is not a first order notion. What we would like to point out is that neither is the notion "closed". Clearly, having a notion of "closed" presupposes that one already has a set of natural numbers and it cannot be used to define one. Thus it is quite possible that from the point of view of N1, N2 is not well ordered and from the point of view of N2, N1 is either not closed or else not a proper set. (E.g. not "internal" in the sense of A. Robinson.) A simple example of this occurs when we pass from a binary relation R to its ancestral R*, the "smallest" transitive relation containing R. Thus if xRy means "x is a parent of y", then xR*y means "x is an ancestor of y". However, even though most people understand R the same way, different people understand R* differently, some of them include, and others leave out, unicellular animals from among their own ancestors. Clearly the difference arises because some people use a small N1 and others use a larger N2 for their set of natural numbers. It may well be that an explanation of the Godel incompleteness theorems will be found in such a multiplicity of sets of natural numbers. If T1 and T2 are two complete extensions of PA then there do in fact exist structures N1 and N2 such that N1 c N2, N1 1 T1 and N2 1 T2. However, this has no interest unless we can actually find such structures N1, N2 in an intrinsic way. It seems plausible that such struc- tures exist but one would have to develop one's model theory within a set theory where Peano's axioms are not (second order) categorical. BIBLIOGRAPHY [B(] P.
