How did attitudes to animals change when, in Late Antiquity, traditional animal sacrifice gave way to bloodless Christian ritual? As so often, the answer to the MacMullen Question ('what dif ference did Christianity make?') is 'less than you might hope', but the question itself is stimulating and the attempt to answer it is instructive. Gilhus suggests (z) that it has not been fully investiga ted because scholars have assumed that the end of animal sacrifice was cultural progress from the primitive beliefs that sustained blood sacrifice. Her own work began within an interdisciplinary project on the construction of Christian identity in antiquity. She has brought together an impres sive range of information and discussion, always explaining what she is doing and why. She covers the practical uses of animals in Roman culture; philosophical debate on animal souls and on what follows for human relationships with animals, including metamorphosis, reincarnation, and human-animal compounds; the roles of animals, and animal imagery, in non-Christian reli gions and in Christian texts. Attitudes to animals are especially liable to what Paul Veyne called 'brain-balkanisation': com passionate interest and even anthropomorphism co-exist with indifference to exploitation and cruelty. In the Roman world, as now, accusations of 'behaving like animals', that is, not like decent human beings, were applied to behaviour that is in fact distinctively human. G. is always aware of the complexities of thought and practice, and recognizes the rhetorical purposes of the few texts that show concern for animals or question the assumption that animals lack reason. She therefore does not offer grand theories of change. She suggests initially (3-4) that the religious and moral value of animals declined as animal sacrifice lost its significance; as the human form was sacralized the animal form was desacralized. But she also notes that animals were not always sacralized, and that meat could be obtained without any sacrificial context. First-century Chris tians in Corinth were anxious about eating meat, not because it had always been offered to idols, but because they could not be sure it had not. G. further acknowledges (154-7) that challenges to animal sacrifice began much earlier than Late Antiquity, and that animal sacrifice was probably in decline long before it was forbidden. Moreover, the end of animal sacrifice did not lead to widespread vegetarianism or to general concern for animals. Most ancient philosophers argued that animals have animating souls, but only humans have logos; the book of Genesis said that God created animals, but only humans are in God's image. G. observes (ii8) that the main impact of Christianity may be on modern interpreters of sacrifice. The image of Christ as the lamb that was slain, the innocent sacrificial victim, may influence them into giving too much significance to the routine activity of killing an animal for meat. Interesting questions arise on the way. For example: why exactly did Celsus compare Chris tians to worms (59-61)? (G. might like Augustine's suggestions for praising worms, de vera religione 4I.77: shiny, slender and rounded, all its parts perfectly adapted to the whole, the worm moves with precision to seek what it needs and to avoid obstacles.) Christian martyr-acts (zoo) give detailed accounts of judicial torture and its visible effects on the body: why do they not also describe people being eaten, by lions or other beasts? If humans are superior to the rest of crea tion, why don't they have wings (447-50)? (See now G. Peers, Subtle Bodies (zooi).) G. ends with Consequences rather than Conclusions: in Late Antiquity, animals no longer had cultic roles linking humans and gods, but animal symbols and metaphors conveyed ideas about human souls and bodies, and food rules, including vegetarianism, marked differences among religious groups. Late antique changes in attitude are difficult to trace, but it is easy to see why, in a twenty-first century culture well informed about animal behaviour and worried about animal survival, animals have moved up the classical agenda. G.'s book is a very welcome addition to the growing bibliography. University of Bristol GILLIAN CLARK</page></plain_text>
