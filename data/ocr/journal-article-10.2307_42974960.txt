Conversation with Sylvia Wynter Stanford University, May 12, 1989 The literature of any people grows organically out of the experiences of that people, informed by imagination and wit - the gift, in short, of artistry.

Zulu Proverb</page><page sequence="2">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 47 On Not Hallucinating: Literature as Knowing The genesis of this chapter is twofold. First, it is to delineate my ideas as literary critic which are based on an analysis and experience of literature as a dynamic, viable discipline that functions on many levels. As art, literature does not exist just for art's sake. Art is also a mirror of life. While art for art's sake is symbolic representation of life, art as a mirror becomes the means for a larger understanding of human life and a bridge between symbol and practice. Long before I grew up to experience the practical world in actuality, the symbolic messages from literature instructed me in the ways of the world and its people. I learned vicariously about history and politics, geography and demography, as well as the customs, habits and idiosyncracies of the world's people. When I finished with the fantasy and escape fiction and poetry provided, I found that over the course of time I had gained extraordinary knowledge about human nature and social life. Therefore, from my earliest days as a reader, literature served me in myriad ways to link the symbolic and the practical. I agree with Barbara Christian, another black literary critic, that "literature is a way of knowing that I am not hallucinating, that whatever I feel/know is" (Christian 1987, 61). Literature as knowing in this way forms the basis for the juxtaposition of fiction and poetry with social practice in this study. The second reason for the genesis of this chapter is to provide a justification for using literature as a mirror of black life.2 Several other issues addressed in this chapter include: What is Afrocentric literary criticism? What is the link between Afrocentric criticism, the use of literature in this way and the sociopolitical context of black life that creates particular challenges for raising sons? In my opinion, the interpretation that art is a mirror of life and the decision to juxtapose literature and social practice in an interdisciplinary inquiry seem perfectly legitimate. Therefore, in this chapter I will explore this way of knowing in more detail. The controversial nature of this interpretation of fiction and poetry as a mirror of life became clearer to me as my coauthor and I discussed our study and our Afrocentric approach to literary and social analysis with colleagues from several disciplines. Their varied reactions (and reservations) about this use of literature helped me to clarify my role as</page><page sequence="3">48 Black Mothers to Sons critic and my understanding of black literature. Though, for me, all literature reveals life, conventional literary criticism holds that true art is universal; therefore, it cannot be political or linked to the particular life experiences of one group. True art functions, according to Eurocentric criticism, primarily in an aesthetic fashion, and its referent is ostensibly universal human values set in the revered Western European past. One bit of information I absorbed from reading fiction and poetry, however, is that human beings and their institutions are inevitably political. This discovery for me, a black woman, is most significant, and is one which I have internalized as a mature person and scholar; it is the basis for my contributions to this study. According to Sylvia Wynter, "Art has its own way of saying... but meaning is always political." This reality informs my analysis of literature. Moreover, the use of literature to illuminate what black mothers feel and know is justified when one considers that, as African Americans, their very presence (whether it is acknowledged or not) makes a political statement. What else, then, can African American art be other than a more intensified, more heightened, more distilled representation of black life? This juncture between literature as symbol and as a mirror of social practice is evident in Barbara Christian's further reflection: "what I write and how I write is done in order to save my own life." She continues at length with this extraordinary idea that a writer's passion is more than a need or desire to express the individual self: My readings [interpretations] do presuppose a need, a desire among folk who like me also want to save their own lives. My concern, then, is a passionate one, for the literature of people who are not in power has always been in danger of extinction or of cooptation, not because we do not theorize, but because what we can even imagine, far less who we can read, is constantly limited by social structures. For me, literary criticism is promotion as well as understanding, a response to the writer to whom there is often no response, to folk who need the writing as much as they need anything [my emphasis]. (Christian 1987, 62) The idea of using literature as a mirror of black life juxtaposed with social practice is more important than ever, given Christian's observation about "the folk who need the writing" and contemporary literary discourse. This discourse, according to Christian, creates</page><page sequence="4">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 49 language "which mystifies rather than clarifies our condition, making it possible for a few people who know that particular language to control the critical scene...." (Christian 1987, 55). That which obscures our condition does not in any way serve those who need the writing; and the function of Afrocentric criticism is to address this need.3 Symbol and Sensibility: The Poem's Way of Saying That "art has its own way of saying" is an interesting and useful place to begin a discussion of the relationship of art to life and the way criticism can illuminate our condition. The art to which I refer in this chapter is literature, especially fiction and poetry, and its unique ability, in my opinion, to edify on two distinct but clearly intertwined levels. I want to make the case that before one begins an analysis based specifically on genre, fiction and poetry both create an aura, a force field, in which the reader finds self in intuitive synchronicity with the author of the text. This, for me, is the magic moment when a reader suspends disbelief and involuntarily enters into covenant with the writer.4 Suspension of disbelief makes possible a poetic/fictional world different from the everyday world. It is as if one has an out-of-body experience which is created by a combination of the author's vision and his or her artistic "dexterity" in articulating that vision. (Equally important is meaning which I shall address later.) My use of the term, "out-of-body," to describe one way of experiencing fiction is comparable to Helen Vendler's description of I. A. Richards' teaching of poetry as "reports from his own journey to the interior of a poem" (Vendler 1989, 47). According to Vendler, "Richards felt the 'flavors' in words as poets feel them; and he experiences the same 'extraordinary happiness' in reading poems that poets find in making them up" (Vendler 1989, 47). The sense of savoring and the joy it creates in a reader is the mystical center of great literature, predicated on the apprehension of something symbolic in and beyond the immediate reality that the writer suggests and the reader intuits. Similarly, Carolyn F. Gerard writes, Art reshapes the raw materials of nature and of human interaction and... interprets reality in a non-analytical, non-intellectual way. Art thus makes a direct appeal to the senses and calls forth a spontaneous</page><page sequence="5">50 Black Mothers to Sons emotional identification with other men [sic] and with the universe. Therefore, the effects of the literary image are most often intuitive, deep beyond the threshold of reason and common sense. (Gerard 1976, 350) In the reader's intuitive response is a glimpse of his or her own poten- tial - whether for composing poetry or for seeing the world through new eyes. This I believe is the first level on which literature edifies. It defies reason, eludes predictions of taste and sensibility in readers and is, in fact, the point at which one realizes that the soul has been touched. This level of edification is one possible result of art's "own way of saying." Cultural Hegemony: Difference, Distortion and Denigration The edification experienced in this harmony between writer and reader is really the inspiration that people crave and which art can provide. How one uses inspiration individually is not the issue here; however, the effort to canonize the cultural sources of inspiration is the issue. What we must appraise is the idea that true artistic inspiration is located in the literature of one culture, but not in that of another culture. This is an attempt to define canon by narrow guidelines that exclude, rather than include. It is based on a failure to accept the elusive quality of inspiration and to trust its importance in the inevitable evolution of the creative process. Moreover, the attempt to define a universal canonical form for all time commodifies inspiration. Such a narrow conception of art is a way of saying that one aesthetic has worked thus far, must be forever preserved in its classical form to work effectively and must be the sole source of knowledge now and in the future. This thinking indicates a crisis of confidence in the very interdependence of people, which is, in fact, what inspiration is really all about: one person's idea meeting another's idea and reflecting on itself to create a third and new idea. In addition to a fear of creativity and the void or Chaos from which it must emanate, this commodification of inspiration into one "acceptable" way of seeing and interpreting art is another way of maintaining distance from the "Other," thereby classifying people who and cultures which differ from the European tradition. A New York Times article that explores Eurocentricity and Afrocentricity discusses</page><page sequence="6">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 5 1 E. D. Hirsch's point of view that America is Eurocentric, not out of any prejudiced motives, but "out of necessity." Hirsch says, "The culture that determined where we were going was pretty well established on these shores in 1776 and it all came from Western Europe" (Berger 1989, B6). The idea that American culture was fully determined by 1776 and that it is wholly European is amazing: it ignores the dynamics of cultural exchange and the historical impact of one culture upon another. What Hirsch's comment really does, however, is obliterate the presence of the Native Americans and Africans who were "here" and whose role in American cultural development has been so problematic for many European Americans. Hirsch's statement also obliterates the cultural influence of other non-European immigrants (Takaki 1989). The cast of mind capable of such a blatant historical distortion is especially disturbing, given Hirsch's influential position in the current controversy about the canon and "what every American needs to know" (Hirsch 1987). Perhaps Toni Morrison's following critique best characterizes the thinking of Hirsch and others of like mind. Morrison writes: We can agree... that invisible things are not necessarily "not there"; that a void may be empty, but is not a vacuum. In addition, certain absences are so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves; arrest us with intentionality and purpose, like neighborhoods that are defined by the population held away from them. Looking at the scope of American literature, I can't help thinking that the question should never have been "Why am I, an Afro-American, absent from it?" It is not a particularly interesting query anyway. The spectacularly interesting question is "What intellectual feats had to be performed by the author or his critic to erase me from a society seething with my presence, and what effect has that performance had on the work?" What are the strategies of escape from knowledge? Of willful oblivion? (Morrison 1989, 1 1-12) Hirsch's belief that America is Eurocentric "out of necessity" suggests a fear of the darker "Other"; the "necessity" of which he speaks is that of maintaining an illusion of majority even though in reality those of European origin are becoming the minority in America and are the minority of the world's population. One accounts for the studied focus on the culture that was established for all time by 1776 if one understands what Morrison means when she speaks of the absences that</page><page sequence="7">52 Black Mothers to Sons are "so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves." Morrison describes both the exclusion of a bona fide African American presence in American literature and the exclusion and denigration of literature by African Americans. Carolyn Gerard helps us further understand this exclusion and denigration. She writes, ...man [sic] projects his image upon the universe. But man does not exist in isolation. It is far more accurate to say that man projects his cultural and racial images upon the universe and he derives a sense of personal worth from the reflection he sees gazing back at him. For he defines himself and the world in terms of others like him. He discovers his identity within a group. (Gerard 1976, 351) The Eurocentric mindset projects a pure image of itself upon the universe; all that is impure is relegated to the Other. The dominating control apparent in defining and maintaining a Eurocentric literary canon is one way to insure that only his "reflection... [gazes] back at him." Though some critics feel that the term "Other" is obsolete, I believe it is relevant to this particular discussion, especially since Hirsch' s historical referent is 1776. The "Other" surfaced (directly and indirectly) in colonial life in many guises - from Thomas Morton of Merrymount (considered a renegade) to the Indians (considered savages) to the forest (considered evil) - all of which had to be conquered. The deepest significance of the "Other" is in the way the concept was and is used to separate people. By 1789 the colonists were forced to make decisions about slavery in America: the "Other" was legally codified as partially-there when male slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person in a compromise to equalize Northern and Southern demographics. The "Other" was morally codified as "not-there" when the black man was defined as inherently evil, thus making black people evil and inferior. At the same time establishing whiteness as inherently good became an ideological imperative (Jordan 1968; Morrison 1989; Rogin 1985). Though Hirsch avows that America is not Eurocentric from prejudiced motives, history would seem to give the lie to this claim. The denigration and distortion of blacks in mainstream literature can be traced to the thinking of Thomas Jefferson, who is clear in Notes on the State of Virginia that slavery was</page><page sequence="8">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 53 a distortion of the democratic experiment, but he was equally convinced that free blacks and whites could not coexist peacefully on American soil. He explains why: Deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of one or the other race. (Jefferson [1787] 1972, 138) Jefferson's further analysis and sentiments in this chapter on "Laws" are worth quoting at length: To these objections, which are political, may be added others, which are physical and moral. The first difference which strikes us is that of colour.... And is... [this difference]... not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two races? Are not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of every passion... preferable to that eternal monotony... of black which covers all the emotions of the other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant symmetry of form, their own judgment in favor of the whites, declared by their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of the Oran-ootan for the black women over those of his own species.... They have less hair on the face and body. They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor.... They seem to require less sleep.... (Jefferson 1972, 138-39) Blacks were considered a blotch on an otherwise "pristine" social, cultural, political landscape. Jefferson's antipathy toward blacks is America's legacy, and Hirsch' s readiness to ignore all the ways in which America is not and never has been purely European is rooted in Jefferson's thinking and that of his contemporaries. If, as Morrison suggests, "cultures... seek meaning in the language and images available to them," then a culture dominant by virtue of its political and economic power has the potential to manipulate the language and images that constitute its artistic view of itself. In order to continue to manipulate language and image, it is imperative to enshrine the idea that art is not political. Yet the very act of exclusion which supports the artistic manipulation of which I speak is political in nature and intent.</page><page sequence="9">54 Black Mothers to Sons As Sylvia Wynter suggests, "art has its own way of saying... but meaning is always political." Perhaps the best way to contemplate the logic in Wynter' s statement is to explore a lovely poem that is central to the American literary canon. It is Archibald MacLeish's "Ars Poetica," which might seem an odd example (MacLeish 1985, 1378-79). However, MacLeish's poem is, for me, an excellent representation of the second level of artistic edification. It demonstrates the point of transition from the idea that literature is a purely aesthetic vehicle to the idea that it can also be used didactically as a political one without, in my opinion, suffering any diminution of truth or beauty. MacLeish's poem reads as follows: A POEM should be palpable and mute As a globed fruit Dumb As old medallions to the thumb Silent as the sleeve-worn stone Of casement ledges where the moss has grown - A poem should be wordless As the flight of birds A poem should be motionless in time As the moon climbs Leaving, as the moon releases Twig by twig the night-entangled trees, Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves, Memory by memory the mind - A poem should be motionless in time As the moon climbs A poem should be equal to: Not true</page><page sequence="10">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 55 For all the history of grief An empty doorway and a maple leaf For love The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea - A poem should not mean But be 5 This poem is one of my favorites because I experience the intuitive synchronicity with the author that I mentioned above in this chapter. My journey to the interior of this poem still leaves me with the ineffable feeling that I have glimpsed and fleetingly grasped the fragility of some of the qualities that constitute the essence of life. I emerge from the poem emotionally and spiritually replenished. The poem suggests that, in fact, only a poem can capture in language this fragility, which cannot sustain the dissection which the critic employs to arrive at "meaning." This poem truly requires the willing suspension of disbelief in the reader because in reality "being" and "meaning" cannot be separated; one informs and shapes the evolution of the other. Therefore, even as I experience that ethereal, out-of-body feeling when I read the poem, my particular reality imposes itself on another level and I struggle with the implications of meaning. In this struggle, it is clear that the only way I can ignore the meaning - even of something as innocent "as the moon [releasing] / Twig by twig the night-entangled trees" - is to make "meaning," in Toni Morrison's words, "not-there." Morrison's term "not-there" suggests to me the political dimension of MacLeish's poetic idea that a "poem should not mean / But be." On one hand, the idyllic intent of "Ars Poetica" does take the reader beyond the mundane, beyond meaning. On the other hand, my particular mindset causes me to wonder about the circumstances and the sensibility that make such a poem possible, for the poem implies that a special political, cultural milieu shaped MacLeish's vision. I do not believe that such wondering destroys the magic of the poem, which cannot be denied. On the contrary, so provocative and succinct is MacLeish's "mandate" ("A poem should not mean / But be") that the poem becomes a "blueprint" for an aspiring poet. But it also sharpens one's focus on a not-so-magic world that is excluded from MacLeish's vision. What I am suggesting is that the tension between "being" and</page><page sequence="11">56 Black Mothers to Sons "meaning" is ultimately not resolved by the magic of the poem, and the questions this tension creates informs my reading of other more obviously political works. In my suspension of disbelief, I accept MacLeish's aesthetic and am edified by it, but the silence at the center of this aesthetic causes me to see clearly certain other images and interpretive possibilities. In other words, MacLeish has access to all the privileges of poetic license (and rightfully so). As long as I do not violate the spirit and integrity of his work, I am free to juxtapose it to other works which it suggests. For example, Archibald MacLeish's exquisite poem invariably reminds me of another verse - equally lofty, equally evocative, but profoundly tragic. The poem is Paul Laurence Dunbar's "The Haunted Oak": Pray why are you so bare, so bare, Oh, bough of the old oak-tree; And why, when I go through the shade you throw, Runs a shudder over me? My leaves were green as the best, I trow, And sap ran free in my veins, But I saw in the moonlight dim and weird A guiltless victim's pains. I bent me down to hear his sigh; I shook with his gurgling moan, And I trembled sore when they rode away, And left him here alone. They'd charged him with the old, old crime, And set him fast in jail: Oh, why does the dog howl all night long, And why does the night wind wail? (Dunbar 1970, 356) Dunbar's poem, partially presented here, is one of many in African American literature that treats the tragic topic of lynching as only an African American sensibility can, since lynching, though common in America's history, was especially brutal in the way it was used against black people and against black men in particular. Dunbar's poem shows how every echelon of white society that should have protected</page><page sequence="12">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 57 the victim was, in fact, complicitous in his death; the judge, the doctor, and the "minister, with his oldest son" were all members of the lynch mob. Only the oak tree, made anthropomorphic, and reflecting sympathetic Nature, is cognizant of the victim's pain, and experiences a curious empathy with him in acknowledging that it is tainted (haunted) by its involuntary complicity in the crime. The point I am making is that one symbolic use of a word (in this case, "moonlight") spurs some readers to consider other contexts in which the same words and images are used to convey different meanings. Therefore, the sensibility out of which MacLeish's poem comes suggests to me the totally different one that is the locus of Dunbar's poem, one based on the awareness of unchecked hatred and racist violence against blacks. This is what Hoyt Fuller means when he says the "literature of any people grows organically out of the experiences of that people." Morrison's observation that cultures "seek meaning in the languages and images available to them" supports this same idea. I do not think it begs the question to compare the meaning in MacLeish's use of trees and moonlight and Dunbar's use of them. Nor do I think it inappropriate to consider the two poems together in order to explore the different sensibilities, though I am aware that this is a point of disagreement with black and white critics alike. Yet how many people who read MacLeish's poem think of lynching? This question - though rhetorical - allows me now to explore the second part of Sylvia Wynter's statement that "meaning is always political." Afrocentric Literary Criticism: Poetic Practice and Politics If we agree with Hoyt Fuller that the "literature of any people grows organically out of the experiences of that people," then we need to acknowledge that the experiences of black (and minority) people in America have been shaped as Dunbar's poem suggests in a crucible of violence and repression, both of which continue to exist today. As a young, contemporary political scientist observed, "Inequality has given way to inequity, which is as unjust as segregation and earlier forms of racism."6 Therefore, the literature of African Americans partially reflects this social reality. Fuller continues, ...America is a racist society. That is, opportunities and rewards are apportioned, for the most part, according to race and color. The</page><page sequence="13">58 Black Mothers to Sons preferred and the privileged are white; the rejected and the degraded are non-white. The whites, who are in the majority and hold the power, proceed under the very natural assumption that the nation's vaunted principles, creeds, and institutions are both valid and operative. The non-whites understand that much of "the good life" for white Americans is bought at the price of their continued subjugation. (Fuller 1972, 330) Fuller's critique adds new dimension to Hirsch' s use of the term "of necessity." On a subconscious level, Hirsch must know that to acknowledge the diversity of America's cultural heritage is to acknowledge the exploitation of that diversity as a means of insuring Eurocentric hegemony and survival. Given the history of racism, and its current manifestations as described by the mothers in this study, it is no wonder that the literature of African Americans reflects that history in all its brutal reality. For this reason, black literature - no matter what the actual topic, no matter how lofty the expression of the topic - is inherently, irrevocably and manifestly political. Its mandate is to edify aesthetically and didactically. For me, this is the essence of black art, especially literature. The use of art as didactic tool is one way in which African Americans have been able to counter-mand the stereotypes and distortions that infuse white cultural depictions of the group. In many ways this is a double-edged sword but one that must be handled, nevertheless. For example, if the literature is to reflect the truth of black life, it must show us our imperfect human nature as well as the trauma caused by oppression and subjugation. Clearly, the best literature is capable of showing the point of equilibrium where intrinsic and extrinsic problems come together to reveal not only the devastation that black people endure but also the transcendence of which we are capable and which we have managed so far. For black people - especially the artists - the aesthetic sensibility will of necessity be colored by a conscious political sensibility. This is the basis of my understanding that all art is political - whether implicit (as with MacLeish's poem) or explicit (as with Dunbar's). The political nature of art is the foundation of Addison Gayle's idea that,</page><page sequence="14">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 59 In order to cultivate an aesthetic sensibility, given an oppressive society, the first prerequisite is that the oppression must end; to pave the way for the possibility of an ars poetica [sic], the oppression must end; in more concrete terms, before beauty can be seen, felt, heard, and appreciated by a majority of the earth's people, a new world must be brought into being; the earth must be made habitable and free for all men [and women]. (Gay le 1976, 379) Gayle makes it clear that addressing this problem is the mandate of what he calls the Black Aesthetic which, ...forms the major criterion for the evaluation of art: How much better has the work of art made the life of a single human being upon this planet, and how functional has been the work of art in moving us toward that moment when an ars poetica [sic] is possible for all? (Gayle 1976, 379) Gayle' s questions also make it clear that there must be more than "art for art's sake," and his ideology of the Black Aesthetic sheds significant light on Archibald MacLeish's poem. "Ars Poetica" means "The Art of Poetry." By implication, the "art of poetry" in its ability to link the tangible world with that of the intangible symbolic world also has the ability to define a state of completion or perfection.7 This, theoretically, is one facet of the aesthetic argument that art must be universal. Recall that MacLeish says, "A poem should not mean / But be." "To be" (a complete and/or static state) precludes "being" or "becoming" (a dynamic state); therefore, the presumed perfection (however momentary) suggested in the poem is questioned in Gayle' s comments which imply that until beauty can be the province of most of the earth's people, no one group has the right to claim the power "to be" as a state that supersedes what it is "to mean." Gayle places the issue squarely in the political arena when he raises questions about whether art has made the world a better place for humankind and especially for African Americans (Gayle 1972). The link between Fuller's point about race, color and privilege and Gayle' s questions about aesthetic sensibility in a world of oppression is clear. One must ask, on whose back is the aesthetic sensibility built? This combination of issues raised at various times and in various ways by African American writers and critics like Christian, Fuller, Gayle, Gerard and Morrison suggests that because the problems are</page><page sequence="15">60 Black Mothers to Sons on-going, each generation has had to address questions about the function of art/literature and the role of the artist/writer. Novelist and critic, John O. Killens, in an interview with Kenneth Peeples, Jr., is most explicit about the function of literature. Killens says, I see art as a weapon to liberate people, and I don't mean just black people. I mean liberate white people too - of their prejudice, their preconceived notions of what the world is about.... What I'm saying is that a people must face their history before they can transcend their history. Americans have never been allowed to face their history so that they still have a kind of cowboy and Indian mindset. They're still going up San Juan Hill with Teddy Roosevelt and the white man's burden, the "Big Stick" policy, Manifest Destiny and the Monroe Doctrine. That's a whole lot of historic distortion and excess garbage for a people to carry around with them year after year. (Peeples 1984, 12-13) Killens is unabashed in his admiration for Paul Robeson and quotes him as saying, "An artist must elect to fight for slavery or for freedom.... I have made my choice. I had no alternatives" (Peeples 1984, 14). Robeson's words reflect the "dilemma as choice" black people experience, including black mothers and artists. 8 Though there are problems and unresolved issues in the Black Aesthetic, one of which I shall address below, it is an especially useful ideology upon which to explain the function of literature and literary criticism and the role of the critic in a study such as this. Support for using black literature to illuminate our social experiences can be found in a perceptive article, "Black Art and the Configuration of Experience," by Ernest Mason and published in the College Language Association Journal (CLA) for 1983. Mason's article is an excellent appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the Black Aesthetic, including its historical precedents. Mason reminds us that the Greek word, "aesthetic," originally meant "perceptible by the senses" (Mason 1983, 1-2). He continues, ...while the term "aesthetic," in its root sense of "perceptible," generally denotes some form of perception or experience of the world of art, the aesthetic or an aesthetic sensibility does not denote an exclusive or even necessary relationship to the world of art. Virtually anything can serve as an aesthetic object or object of</page><page sequence="16">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 61 perception-people, events, and other practical daily concerns. (Mason 1983, 3) Mason astutely observes that the Black Aesthetic critic perceives himself (herself) as an educator - here education means "a process of coming to self-consciousness, of both discovering and creating one's self' (Mason 1983, 10). Most important to our study is Mason's assertion that the Black Aesthetic "has... told us that individual choice, volition, and personal responsibility constitute the cluster of characteristics that make a race or culture uniquely itself..." (Mason 1983,11). He stresses that, Being a black man or a black woman in this sense is only a potentiality, not a given. It is not something which comes with one's physiological make-up, but rather a spiritual and cultural goal to be attained or striven towards - a goal which can be either helped or hindered by the actions and attitudes of one's self and others [my emphasis]. It is precisely that spiritual goal which motivates the critical method of the Black Aesthetic. (Mason 1983, 1 1) Ernest Mason discusses what I believe is the significant link between symbol and practice, that is, the potential of art to provide an ethical, moral, spiritual framework upon which to improve black life and change society. Mason's idea is comparable to what Helen Vendler says of I. A. Richards, who was mentioned earlier, "The becoming-that-is-understanding has the same moral consequences... as any other experience of becoming; in that truth lies the link between poetry and living. It is unthinkable to him that genuine art should be other than moral in its effect" (Vendler 1989, 47). Mason's discussion reveals the importance of inspiration as the intangible dynamic that links writer, artist and reader and explains why Barbara Christian must write to save her own life and the lives of her readers. Regenerating Community: The Black Aesthetic and Beyond The use of the Black Aesthetic in this study is important not only for its strengths but also because its shortcomings, which Mason identifies, provide the blueprint for what the next generation of critics must do. Mason criticizes the fact that "the philosophy of the Black Aesthetic lacked a satisfactory conception of 'community,' [one]... that</page><page sequence="17">62 Black Mothers to Sons was capable of incorporating the vast variety of black experiences" (Mason 1983, 15). The Afrocentric perspective in this study starts with the assumption of "community" and expands it to include the people and the writer/researcher. This conception of community is based on the sum total of the experiences of the people which is a reservoir of creative inspiration for the writer and critic and the data base for the social researcher. Afrocentric artistic judgment attempts, then, to return the artistic object to the community in a form which illuminates for black people and with them what has been written about their lived experiences and to show the relationship between what the artist says and what the people live. The responsibility of the Afrocentric critic is to count herself as one of the folk writing to save her life while helping the folk discover ways to save theirs. This method of criticism, while a profoundly political act, does not preclude the aesthetic value of the work. It is a collaborative not an individual process. The blues, as both artistic expression and social critique, is an example of this. All literature edifies, as I discussed at the beginning of this chapter; it encompasses the aesthetic and the political nurturing of the mind, spirit and body. And it nurtures the collective body or community by giving back the best of what the community has provided as inspiration to the artist, critic, researcher. The gathering of the mothers into a circle, the sharing with them what African American literature reveals about mother-to-son relationships and the conscious linking of the literature to our lived experiences show us that we are not "hallucinating." The precious connection between perception and experience is restored and the knowledge that one is not hallucinating restores the sense of mental balance and spiritual wholeness. This is the unifying of symbol and practice in the Black Aesthetic and the meaning of "art for life's sake." Dona Richards explains the significance of this unity in terms of African humanism when she says, There is no closer bond that a group of black people can feel than that which comes from the experience of feeling and expressing our deepest emotions together. The group becomes a sacred community once again and so its members gain strength from communal experience. The ritual becomes an affirmation of their communal</page><page sequence="18">Joyce Elaine King and Carolyn Ann Mitchell 63 identity and so a reservoir of psychic even political strength. (Richards 1985, 220) Mason's reminder about the origins of the word "aesthetic" makes more profound the linking of this word with the political, for it is the link between perception and experience that holds the key to black survival. In this study we are engaging in what Adrienne Rich (1979) calls "Revision - the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction - [which] is for women [sic] more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival. Until we can understand the assumptions in which we are drenched we cannot know ourselves" (Rich 1979, 35). The Afrocentric critical method attempts to see with fresh eyes; it takes the literature back to the people, identifying them as the source of it, revealing to them their own spiritual resonances and suggesting ways in which their newfound insights can benefit those whom they love and must prepare to face the future. Perhaps Henry Louis Gates, Jr., another black critic, provides the ultimate justification for this study: "And for us as scholar-critics, learning to speak in the voice of the black mother is perhaps the ultimate challenge of producing a discourse of the Other" (Gates 1989, 45). The Eurocentric canon notwithstanding, Afrocentric critical methodology identifies artistic truth as a resilient, evolving, dynamic force that is not the exclusive province of any one group and cannot be imprisoned in any one body of belief. The truth is liberated in extraordinary ways, at unlikely times, to serve and inform the people. In fact and in faith, "It is danced and a chance is given to others." 9 Chapter III Notes 1 Dona Richards (1985, 229) observes that "African humanism rejects the concept of 'art for art's sake' and replaces it with 'art for life's sake.'" 2 We use the concept of art/literature as a "mirror of life" to connote an approximate representation of reality. A mirror, in spite of its tendency to distort, is nonetheless a means of illumination that makes possible a dialogue between reader and writer. The "suspension of disbelief," discussed below, is one way for such an approximation to be</page><page sequence="19">64 Black Mothers to Sons the basis of dialogue. Art as mirror connects the two equally valuable, dynamically interrelated facets of art: "art for art's sake" and "art for life's sake." 3 As Hartsock (1987), JanMohamed and Lloyd (1987), Said (1978) and others note, there is a place for "minority discourse" in the evolving discipline of literary theory. 4 Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1968, 274), who was collaborating with Wordsworth, writes in Biographia Literaria: "...it was agreed that my endeavors should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic; yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest or semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief... which constitutes poetic faith." 5 In my opinion this poem's inclusion in the Norton Anthology reflects its place in the American literary canon. 6 Conversation with Gregory B. Taylor, June 4, 1989. 7 The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia (1983) defines "aesthetics" as follows: branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of art and the criteria of artistic judgment. The concept of art as imitation of nature was formulated by Plato and developed by Aristotle, both of whom held that beauty inheres in the object itself and may be judged objectively. Kant held that the subject may have universal validity while other thinkers, e.g., Hume, identified beauty with that which pleases the observer. 8 The work of Killens and Robeson reflects one segment of the spectrum of opinion on the political nature of black art. A full discussion of the range of viewpoints is beyond the scope of this chapter. See Charles Johnson (1988), Being and Race and the discussion among Joyce Joyce (1987), Henry Louis Gates (1987), Houston Baker (1987) and Theodore Mason's critical review in Callaloo (Summer 1988). 9 This proverb is found in Developing the Inner Self: Meditations Based on African Wisdom by Erskine Peters (1982a).</page></plain_text>
