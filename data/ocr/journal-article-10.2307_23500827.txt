Bee-keeping in the Federation has many enthusiastic supporters although it is probable that it could play an even larger part in the economy than it does at present. One of the handicaps of bee-keeping in this part of the world is the lack of reference literature which is applicable to our rather special conditions. Apiarists will therefore be interested in a book which was not specially designed for Africa but was written nevertheless by a Hollander who has spent much of his life in the tropics. He is also the brother of a botanist, Professor A. D. J. Meeuse, who until recently worked in the National Herbarium, Pretoria. 216</page><page sequence="2">The story of pollination is a fascinating one and is most attractive ly presented by the author. The black and white figures, as well as the coloured figures, are extremely clear and attractive. The story of colour-vision and colour-blindness in bees is very well told in simple language whilst all those interested in natural history will find facets of the story of pollination to interest them. The description of the pollination of Kigelia species by bats is intriguing whilst the principles of flower colouration presented here throw a little light on a subject not often dealt with in works of general botanical interest. The text employs a racy and somewhat transatlantic style which may not suit more scientifically minded readers but the work is frankly aimed at the scientifically minded layman rather than at the working scientist. Even so, one feels that unashamedly anthropomorphic and teleological forms of expression should be avoided since they amount, not only to a popularization, but to an actual distortion of interpreta tion. Some typical examples are found on p. 134, e.g. "It is indeed interesting to note that, in contrast, flowers enlist the co-operation of the 'smart' bees by offering them nice colours and attractive smells and sweet nectar."
