<plain_text><page sequence="1">Priscilla Leder Contingency, Cultivation, and Choice: The Garden Ethic in Barbara Kingsolver's Prodigal Summer Barbara Kingsolver responds to a reader's question about how to read her novel Prodigal Summer : "I'd ask you to read slowly; this is the most challenging book I've ever given my readers. [. . .] My agenda is to lure you into thinking about whole systems, not just individual parts. [. . .] Notice the sentence that begins and ends the book: 'Solitude is only a human presumption'" ("Frequently Asked Questions"). The novel brings to life the Appalachian ecosystem of Zebulon Mountain and creates its own system by interweaving three stories of people enmeshed in their own systems: the ranger who tends the mountain and the hunter who invades it; a chestnut breeder and an apple farmer, aging neighbors who quarrel about pro- priety and pesticides; and an entomologist struggling to adjust to life as a farmer's widow. All of these characters presume themselves to be solitary in some sense, yet each emerges from solitude as the story unfolds. Kingsolver believes her American audience is unaccustomed to thinking in terms of systems: "The story asks for a broader grasp of connections and interdependencies than is usual in our culture" ("Frequently Asked Questions"). Readers who meet the novel's chal- lenge to think systemically are ready to ponder the other sentence Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 16.2 (Spring 2009) Advance Access publication April 29, 2009 doi:10.1093/isle/isp026 © The Author(s) 2009.

As Kingsolver's characters move from solitude toward connection, as biological creatures and as con- scious, thinking beings, they demonstrate the difficulty and the neces- sity of choices made in and through an awareness of "whole systems." In one of the few scholarly discussions of Prodigal Summer published so far, Peter Wenz maintains that the novel expresses the "land ethic" articulated by Aldo Leopold in A Sand County Almanac . A land ethic, Leopold declares, "changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such" (240). Wenz demonstrates in detail the correspondences between Kingsolver's systems and Leopold's land community. With the similarities established, Wenz goes on to compare the two works as environmental rhetoric and finds Prodigal Summer more effective: "Because readers often assimilate views more easily when associating those views with identifiable people and personalities, Kingsolver's exposition of environmental conflicts has a pedagogical advantage over Leopold's" (122). Wenz sees character as an effective means to lure the reader into thinking about systems, but some reviewers of Prodigal Summer focus on people and personalities while criticizing the lessons they present. For instance, Jeff Giles of Newsweek finds the ending "suddenly and unexpectedly touching" but complains that the "fierce-minded female characters" who "stand in for the author" are "almost always smart and right" in the mini-lectures they deliver to the men (82). Reviews by Paul Gray and Jennifer Schuessler offer similar criticisms, finding the characters engaging but their message too heavy-handed. Reviewers such as these have the wrong approach, according to Kingsolver: "Several reviewers have completely missed what the book is about, because they paid no attention to anything beyond the human plot on the shallowest level. This novel is not exclusively- or even mainly- about humans" ("Frequently Asked Questions"). Writers of short reviews like those cited above may lack the space or the inclination to focus on anything other than "the human plot on the shallowest level." But even the thoughtful readers that Kingsolver hopes to foster through her suggestions will understand- ably identify with the human characters; that's how people read novels, after all. By reading "the human plot" beyond "the shallowest level" to examine how those characters think and act within that system, readers can learn to consider their own actions. Acting responsibly as part of the ecosystem, Kingsolver shows us, can never</page><page sequence="3">Garden Ethic 229 be encompassed by a single code of conduct. Rather, people can only remain aware that "every choice is a world made new for the chosen." Wenz's assumption that the "characters [. . .] illustrate how a person with an ecological conscience might meet her needs and face life's triumphs and tragedies" holds true for careful readers, especially if we are mindful of the word "might," for Kingsolver's systems incorporate contingency as well as order. To better understand the distinction between a superficial empha- sis on the "human plot" and an understanding of that plot as a narra- tive of characters making considered choices in and through their connection to the system, we can examine the work's much-discussed emphasis on sexuality. Each of the three interwoven plots incorpor- ates the teeming fecundity of the Appalachian summer: The chestnut farmer Garnett Walker experiences a. dream about his neighbor Nannie Rawley "so real that he'd awakened plagued with the con- dition he hadn't known for years," despite both his animosity toward her and their ages- she's 75 and he's pushing 80 (368). The widowed Lusa Landowski's erotic dreams feature a giant moth, and, like a moth, she attracts the men of her late husband's family through the power of pheromones. Deanna Wolfe, the solitary ranger who guards and maintains Zebulon Mountain, enjoys an intense summer- long affair with the hunter Eddie Bondo despite their differences. Kingsolver describes that relationship in glowing detail, evoking a snide comparison with "romance novels at the grocery store" from one reviewer and a pained reference to "overabundant detail" from the National Catholic Reporter (Charles 20; MacEoin 19). Although their perspectives obviously differ, both reviewers see the eroticism of Prodigal Summer in the context of the insistent depictions of sexu- ality that have come to pervade our culture. Perhaps partly in response to comments like those, Kingsolver acknowledges the diffi- culty of depicting sexuality in a cultural climate in which the "language of coition has been stolen [. . .] divvied up like chips in a poker game among the sides of pornography, consumerism, and the medical profession" ("Taming the Beast with Two Backs" 225). In such a climate, reviewers may have seen more of what they see so often and overlooked her efforts to reclaim that language. In the essay "Taming the Beast with Two Backs," Kingsolver com- ments humorously and insightfully on her search for a language to describe the beast, to "tell of its terror and beauty" (227). She under- took that search with self-conscious care because she had never depicted sex explicitly. "In my previous books," she notes, "I mostly wrote about sex by means of the spacebreak" (222). But sex was integral to the subject matter of Prodigal Summer, "the biological</page><page sequence="4">230 ISLE exigencies of human life," so the characters not only engage them- selves with reproduction- breeding apples, chestnuts, and goats- but also experience the exigencies of their own biology (227). The elderly neighbors face the painful joints and diminished hearing and eyesight that come with aging; the widowed Lusa feels the longings of the mateless and rediscovers the power of hormones through the return of her monthly cycle; Deartna experiences her first sex with Eddie as "the body's decision, a body with no more choice of its natural history than an orchid has" (24). This "body's decision" has, however, been prefaced by a conscious one, as Deanna invites Eddie to spend the night in her cabin. Sex in this novel represents not only the biology of the characters but also their conscious human processing of that biology. In propos- ing to go dancing with her seventeen-year-old nephew Rickie, Lusa questions the assumption that "dancing's basically just the warm-up act": "[Tjhat's true for most animals. Insects do that, birds do, even some mammals. But we've got great big brains, you and me. I think we could distinguish a courtship ritual from the act itself. Don't you?" (418). Although bodies cannot choose their "natural history" - the needs and urges common to mammals- they do create contexts for and assign meanings to the expression of those needs and urges. Prodigal Summer is, significantly, "about humans" because it explores the process through which humans create contexts and assign mean- ings. Its characters participate in biological systems both within and outside of themselves; every choice makes both a new individual and a new world- for the chooser as well as the chosen- in ways that are not always predictable. Kingsolver's triple plot underscores the ways in which individuals interact within a system, altering and influencing each other in myriad and sometimes unexpected ways. Each plot features a single species referred to in its title- [Luna] "Moth Love," "Predators" [coyotes], and "Old Chestnuts," but all three species figure in each plot. For example, all of the characters encounter a coyote at some point in the narrative, and the coyote's ramblings, in fact the very pre- sence of coyotes in this region at all, illustrate the sometimes- unpredictable variation in biological systems and the complex interconnections among species. The characters not only experience and interact with the living species that surround them, they also discuss the nature of that inter- action, invoking scientific principles to elucidate it. In each plot, one character carefully explains to another how the relationship between species in a system can be characterized as a pyramid incorporating layers of predators and prey. According to the "Volterra Principle,"</page><page sequence="5">Garden Ethic 231 predators reproduce more slowly than the species they prey upon, and, as Nannie tells Garnett, "'that works out right in nature because one predator [insect] eats a world of pest bugs in its life. The plant eaters have to go faster just to hold their ground. They're in balance with each other'" (275). This balance holds all the way up the pyramid to the carnivores, such as the coyote, who form its apex. Human actions, such as killing coyotes or spraying with broad- spectrum insecticides that kill predator insects along with prey, disrupt this balance, allowing prey such as rabbits or plant-eating insects to reproduce unchecked. Through her characters, Kingsolver cautions against such practices, choices that remake worlds in destructive ways and, ironically, fail to achieve their intended results. Articulations of the Volterra principle appear and reappear in Prodigal Summer just as do the three focal species. The characters illus- trate the principle with concrete examples, but it is actually a "pair of first order, nonlinear, differential equations" first proposed in the 1920s by mathematicians Vito Volterra and Alfred J. Lotka to describe relationships between predators and prey ("Lotka-Volterra Equations"). Thus, that most human of artifacts, an abstract math- ematical principle, performs the same narrative function and recurs in the same cycle as moths, coyotes, and chestnut trees, along with other human artifacts such as a pair of green brocade easy chairs. This intermingling of products of nature and of the human mind par- allels the lives of the characters- the interactions between their "big brains" and the biological processes within and around them. It also reflects the reality that humans can never encounter a natural world untouched by their own presence, not only because our actions have altered that world but also because, as Michael Pollan points out in "The Idea of a Garden," "we know nature only through the screen of our own metaphors" (227). Even a book that is "not about humans" implicitly acknowledges this reality, and the experiences of the char- acters reveal it. Pollan distinguishes between the "wilderness ethic," which sees humans as distinct from nature, and the "garden ethic," which acknowledges the inescapable reality of the human presence in nature. The wilderness ethic grows out of "the sense that nature undisturbed displays a miraculous order and balance, something the human world can only dream about" (214). Although this concept incorporates a reverence for nature, it also generates a false either /or which allows us to do anything we want with whatever is not wilder- ness. Thus, Pollan points out, "Americans have done an admirable job of drawing lines around certain sacred areas (we did invent the wilderness area) and a terrible job of managing the rest of our land"</page><page sequence="6">232 isle (223). Based on a simple either/or (the kind of absolute distinction so prevalent in today's political climate), the wilderness ethic is easily followed: anything outside the lines can be exploited for maximum profit. Following a garden ethic demands more thought, in part because conscientious gardeners must adapt to place. The good gardener must also be "in control of his appetites, solicitous of nature, self- conscious and responsible, mindful of the past and future, and at ease with the fundamental ambiguity of his predicament- which is that though he lives in nature, he is no longer strictly of nature" (232). In other words, gardeners must react responsibly to individual situ- ations, aware always that "every choice is a world made new for the chosen." Through the experiences of her protagonists, Kingsolver shows both the limitations of the wilderness ethic and the constant vigilance necessary to maintain a garden (or its larger version, a farm) responsibly. On the mountain she has undertaken to maintain as pristine wild- erness, the ranger Deanna Wolfe imagines herself alone among thou- sands of living species and the ghosts of the extinct species whose loss she mourns. But she cannot maintain her solitude inviolate any more than she (or anyone else) can know exactly where the wilder- ness area ends and the Widener farm begins. Her encounter with the hunter Eddie Bondo not only ends her solitude but also compels her to accept the inevitable interaction of humans and nature. "Predators," the title of the sections describing Deanna's relation- ship with Eddie and her resulting pregnancy, conflates the two of them with all of the predatory animals on the mountain, especially the coyotes that he intends to hunt and that she observes and pro- tects. More than once, she feels herself watched by a creature who could be either Eddie or a coyote (67). Both forest creatures given to solitary ramblings, Deanna and Eddie resemble one another like the competing predators of the same species described by one of the Volterra equations. Similarly, the spontaneity and intensity of their sexual encounter makes them seem like predators in a sexual sense, out for immediate gratification. Deanna resents her own needs even as she gratifies them; Eddie's presence in her mind and on the mountain violates her hard-won sense of solitary autonomy. She tells him she despises him for "me wanting you to come back," revealing her inner turmoil through her awkward expression (99). And she resents his discovery of her favor- ite shelter in a huge old hollow chestnut tree, insisting, "That's my place!" and stubbornly denying his reasonable assertion that "a few other people might have run across it" since "[i]t's been lying there</page><page sequence="7">Garden Ethic 233 about a hundred years" (95). Her sense of ownership of the tree (and the mountain itself) contradicts the idea of wilderness as open and variable, just as her resentment of Eddie contradicts her attachment to him. According to Pollan, the notion of absolute possession of ter- ritory is simply the complement of the idea of the pristine, bounded wilderness (223). Deanna's sense that the forest is hers grows out of her belief that her efforts can keep it inviolate. To keep the mountain and herself inviolate, she must maintain her image of Eddie as a threatening, competing predator and ignore other aspects of his character and their relationship. After his depar- ture she regrets that "she'd made no dent, had never altered his heart to make room in it for a coyote" (432). Neither Deanna nor the reader knows Eddie's heart, but he has altered his behavior and given space to coyotes. From the beginning, he tells her, he has accepted a tacit "deal" that he will not hunt the coyote family on Zebulon Mountain (181). And instead of roaming the countryside annihilating other coyotes, he spends his time assisting Deanna, "bringing armloads of firewood like bouquets" (180). His only kill in the novel is a torn turkey that he shoots to provide her with protein because he thinks she looks "peaked." This restrained predator differs considerably from the bounty hunters who compete to see who can kill the most coyotes in forty hours, described in "The Ultimate Survivor," Mike Finkel's essay on coyotes and coyote hunting that Kingsolver drew upon for Prodigal Summer. Eddie's willingness to adapt, even to read Deanna's thesis, which argues that coyotes should not be killed because they maintain a healthy balance between predators and prey, raises the possibility that responsible interaction with the natural world- good gardening, in other words- can grow out of the mutual education of human beings. In Prodigal Summer, according to Patrick D. Murphy, "male and female characters learn from each other, articulate ideas to each other, and engage in verbal and sensuous dialogues with each other and the interanimating world in which they grow [. . .]" (202). Though Deanna clings to her idea of the mountain as pristine and Eddie continues to hate coyotes because they kill livestock, their many dialogues demonstrate the kind of negotiation necessary to arrive at reasoned, responsible interaction with the natural world. After all, both are farmers at heart. The productive resolution of their dialogue occurs not literally but symbolically with Deanna's pregnancy, raising the possibility that future generations might grow to be good gardeners. No longer soli- tary, she writes to Nannie Rawley: "T'll be coming down from the mountain this fall [. . .] when it starts to get cold. It looks like I'll be</page><page sequence="8">234 isle bringing somebody with me" (391). With a child, she can neither stay on the mountain nor maintain the illusion that she is only a respectful observer of the natural cycles unfolding around her. No longer just a student of biology, she is now subject to its laws. Further, she must help her child become not a coyote but a human being mindful of his/her place in the natural world, even though she has never liked teaching. Deanna's acceptance of her new existence as a gardener remains implicit in her letter to Nannie, and some of her experiences on the mountain reveal the limitations of her vision of herself as soli- tary in the wilderness, accepting and observing all of its actions. Over their turkey feast, Deanna and Eddie agree that "living takes life." In other words, death, including violent death, is vital to the natural cycle. Eddie imagines himself participating in that cycle by killing coyotes; Deanna believes that humans should not interfere with that cycle, that they should simply observe and respect it. But she finds herself protesting it hours later when she discovers that the black snake that has been living in the roof of her cabin has eaten the fledgling phoebe birds nested on her porch: " But not the babies , she cried in her mind. Not these; they were mine " (329). Her cry prefigures the pregnancy of which she is not yet aware, and, like the pregnancy, it reveals the impossibility of the kind of detachment to which Deanna aspires. Significantly, she has always had difficulty with another destruc- tive manifestation of nature; thunderstorms terrify her. After Eddie departs, unaware of what he has left behind, Deanna endures a hurri- cane. Panicked as the solid trees around her cabin bend and break, she remains "unaware that she was holding her braid in her teeth and both hands protectively over her abdomen. Unaware that she would never again be herself alone- that solitude was the faultiest of human presumptions" (434). She attempts to stem panic by counting the logs in the wall and realizes that the stack of interlocked trunks that composes her cabin is stronger than any single falling tree. " Shelter , was what dawned on her as she stared" (435). Though Deanna thinks of them as "fallen," she knows the trees have been felled by humans years before. More importantly, the interlocking design is the product of human ingenuity. Although she will always cherish and preserve the natural world, she can no longer imagine herself solitary in it; rather, she must acknowledge the action of humans, including herself, upon and within that world. The cabin that shelters Deanna was built by a "[g]uy named Walker, Garnett something Walker. There was this whole line of them, all with the same name. Kind of like land barons in this area, a hundred years ago" (173). "Old Chestnuts," another of the three</page><page sequence="9">Garden Ethic 235 plots of Prodigal Summer , features the last Garnett Walker, now close to eighty. His modest farm all that remains of the Walker holdings, the retired vocational agriculture teacher occupies himself with the effort to breed a strain of chestnuts resistant to the blight. However, he retains some of the attitudes of his land baron ancestors; though he cherishes the nature he knows, he regards it as his to possess and control. Kingsolver introduces him with an image that embodies his point of view: "The grass-covered root cellar [built by his father and grandfather] still bulged from the hillside, the two windows in its fieldstone face staring out of the hill like eyes. [. . .] Every morning of his life, Garnett had saluted the old man in the hillside with the ivy beard [. . .] and the forelock of fescue hanging over his brow" (49). Garnett's gesture acknowledges the "old man's" power; his "salute" conveys respect, but at the same time the face literally and figura- tively reflects his own, suggesting the god he both resembles and worships. Writing to Nannie, Garnett sets forth his view that we are to "think of ourselves as keepers and guardians of the earth, as God instructed us to do [. . .] So God created man in his own image: [. . .] and God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it'" (186). For Garnett, "man's" dominion over nature is bound up with his creation in God's image. Thus, his arguments to Nannie often insist on the importance of proper, dignified human behavior along with the primacy of man over nature. If humans do not have such God-given dominion, he maintains, then we have no definite responsibility to nature: it is not "our duty to set free the salamanders, any more than it is the sala- mander's place to swim up to the state prison [. . .] and liberate the criminals" (186). Garnett thinks in the kinds of absolutes that underlie what Pollan calls the wilderness ethic. Whether one reveres nature as an autonomous entity, as Dearina does, or as a manifes- tation of God, as Garnett does, "[f]or many of us, nature is a last bastion of certainty; wilderness is something beyond the reach of history and accident" (218). That certainty not only comforts us but also relieves us of the obligation to choose how we will deal with the natural world. Garnett does make choices: laboring to preserve the mighty chest- nut trees but annihilating insects with Sevin, and asking "If [. . .] those muddly little salamanders went extinct, who would care anyway?" (187) In nature, as in his own life, he cherishes the godly image that he struggles to maintain and protect. Kingsolver's depic- tions of the personal aspects of that struggle reveal the reflexive, and consequently limiting, quality of Garnett's interactions with the</page><page sequence="10">236 isle natural world. In one episode, his first reaction to an unusual heavi- ness in his left leg is embarrassment, then terror that he might be having a stroke. Injured dignity gives way to vulnerability; if he is not in control, he feels helpless, but an investigation might have revealed that a snapping turtle has attached itself to his boot. His thoughts about the turtle unwittingly reveal himself: "Poor thing, thought Garnett, to have to commit yourself so hard to one moment of poor judgment" (89). Another passage reveals that he has endured episodes of vertigo for twenty years without consulting a doctor because, as he explains it, "At first I thought it must be something awful gone wrong inside my head [. . .] then I didn't want to know" (340). With "something awful gone wrong" he is no longer whole or adequate, something he doesn't want to contemplate. He also thinks of the dizziness as a "curse," perhaps a manifestation of God's disfa- vor which reduces him to less than godly status. Through Nannie Rawley, Garnett learns an exercise which elimin- ates his dizziness, and his interactions with her begin to penetrate his carefully maintained sense of his godlike dominion over himself and the world around him. In a final comic incident, he becomes obsessed with a mysterious man he observes leaning on Nannie's fence. When the man doesn't leave for two days, Garnett takes a shotgun and goes to confront him. On closer inspection, "everything about him appear[s] unnatural," and Garnett realizes that "He'd been jealous of a scarecrow" (423). By creating a scarecrow, a farmer like Nannie makes a modest attempt to control nature by placing a human image in it. Garnett and those who think like him project a human image, God, onto nature in order to assert dominion over it. But, Kingsolver gently suggests, that image is as flaccid and blank as the scarecrow: "But of course there was no face" (423). Garnett's mistake, like the projection of an anthropomorphic God onto nature, results from his refusal to see himself as vulnerable by consenting to cataract surgery. "The less he could see of this world [. . .], the better" (396). His atti- tude, like his limited vision, isolates him, but when Nannie sees the shotgun and asks about it, he manages to admit his folly: "I didn't care for the way [the scarecrow] was looking at you in your short pants" (427). Touched as well as amused, Nannie embraces him, and, like Deanna, he begins to lose his illusion of solitude. Deanna and Garnett maintain illusions of solitude based on the visions of nature as a self-contained absolute that Pollan identifies with the wilderness ethic. Lusa, in contrast, manifests the attitude of a gardener from the beginning; significantly, she has dreamed of becoming a farmer since childhood (35). The gardener, according to Pollan, "accepts contingency" and "doesn't spend a lot of time</page><page sequence="11">Garden Ethic 237 worrying about whether he has a god-given right to change nature/' though s/he also "respects and nurtures" it (226, 228). Married only a year, Lusa has not yet adapted to life on a farm and as part of a large extended family when her husband Cole's death in a truck acci- dent confronts her with an overwhelming contingency. As she copes with his absence by gradually turning her love and her energy to the farm and the family, her experiences illustrate the sensitivity and thought necessary to be a good gardener: to respect nature's systems while acknowledging the reality of human needs. When two of Lusa's brothers-in-law inform her that they intend to plant tobacco on the farm she has inherited from her husband, their family farm, her personal gardener's ethic prompts her to balk, even after they point out the near-impossibility of making a profit on any other crop. To her sister-in-law, she acknowledges the difficulty of her position even as she defends it: "I'm being stupid, I guess. Farm economics, what do I know? But half the world's starving, Jewel, we're sitting on some of the richest dirt on this planet, and I'm going to grow drugs instead of food? I feel like a hypocrite. I nagged Cole to quit smoking every day of our marriage" (122). As she con- tinues to weigh her own profit against her concern for the health of others, the tobacco sets she needs to plant the crop become unavail- able, and the decision is no longer hers to make. Thus, readers par- ticipate in the process of deliberation by reading arguments for and against raising tobacco; in the absence of a decision from Lusa, they must make their own decisions or continue to deliberate. Through this and other episodes in which characters take major decisions "off camera," Kingsolver engages readers in the deliberative process. Readers also participate as Kingsolver details the process through which Lusa discovers a crop for her first year of farming. According to Pollan, an "ethic based on the garden would give local answers," and Lusa finds her answer in the goats many local families have left over from ill-considered 4-H projects undertaken years before (225). The goats constitute a solution for Lusa (though not for the locals) because she knows of a market for them, but she makes the connec- tion between product and market through a conversation with her seventeen-year-old nephew Rickie. The saving solution emerges through Lusa's openness and willingness to engage Rickie in the kind of mutually educational dialogue that, in Kingsolver's work in general and in Prodigal Summer in particular, leads characters to an understanding of themselves and of their relationship with the natural world. When Lusa reveals that the fresh milk from the cow she is milking doesn't agree with her, the conversation turns to nationality and</page><page sequence="12">238 isle religion. Rickie has heard from his aunts that Lusa is "one of those other Christianities" and expresses surprise when she describes the religious traditions she has encountered through her Palestinian mother and her Polish Jewish father: "ā' thought people who didn't believe in God just mostly worshipped the devil and stuff" (151, 153). Taken aback by his ignorance, she considers abandoning the conversation. "This was her cue, surely, to shrug this boy off and shoo him home. But then what? Wait for Cole to explain her to this family?" (153). She could, of course, give up on the family as well as on the conversation. But her ability to adapt prompts her to try to lift "the burden of her aloneness" by relating to the family even though she seems foreign to them. Throughout Kingsolver's works, families are made as well as born, and adoption becomes a form of adap- tation. Lusa survives by cultivating the soil in which she finds herself. Lusa explains the "other Christianities," pointing out that Jews, Moslems, and Christians worship the same god. When the talk turns to "other Christmases," she describes the goat feasts of Id-al-Fitr and Id-al-Adha, and Rickie remarks that he would not eat goat even though he's raised two. As Lusa begins to imagine goats on her farm, she interrupts herself: "She walked over and took the [cigarette] pack from him. 'Can I try this?"' (157). She attributes her surprising gesture first to depression- 'I can't even get excited about seeing thirty, to tell you the truth"- and then to a kind of solidarity: "if tobacco's the lifeblood of this county, I should support the project" (157, 159). By lighting the first cigarette of her life, she also embraces her vulnerability, to death and to the family, and returns to Rickie some of the authority she has established by her vastly superior knowledge. After an interval in which Lusa learns about Cole's sisters and imagines the young Cole through Rickie, he asserts that authority by returning the subject to goats and informing her that neighbors will give her their unwanted goats. By opening herself to her immediate environment and drawing on her own resources, she strikes on a productive idea. She will raise organic kids that a Palestinian cousin, a New York butcher, can sell for traditional feasts. Her willingness to talk to Rickie, despite their differences, creates the soil in which a solution can bloom: "He was listening to her carefully. It made her listen more carefully to herself" (165). Goats prove a practical solution for Lusa's farm; the locals readily give her their unwanted animals, and her overgrown pasture pro- vides excellent fodder. But for environmentally conscious people like Lusa, Kingsolver herself, and certainly some of Kingsolver's readers, raising animals for slaughter can seem morally problematic. Lusa</page><page sequence="13">Garden Ethic 239 tells her niece Chrys, "my vegetarian friends [have] [. . .] informed me I'm a sellout" (356). She categorizes them and their criticism of her with "Uncle Joel," a brother-in-law who feels that she is "throwing the place away" through her refusal to plant tobacco (356). This juxta- position of the two attitudes reveals the underlying similarity that Pollan condemns in the wilderness ethic. Uncle Joel believes nature should be exploited for profit; the vegetarian friends believe that nature must be left absolutely alone. In "Lily's Chickens," a thought-provoking essay on the ethics of food production and consumption, Kingsolver questions rigid edicts on what should and should not be consumed. Acknowledging that she and her family eat "some animals," she deconstructs the notion that "it's a sin to eat anything with a face," pointing out that the "but- terflies and bees and locusts" killed, along with the wildlife killed or displaced to raise (even organic) vegetables, all have faces (119). Rather, Kingsolver limits meat consumption because it can be waste- ful of resources: "A pound of cow or hog flesh costs about ten pounds of plant matter to produce" (119). Lusa's farm uses resources economically, however, since her goats feed on an otherwise unused pasture, and her garden and trees produce ample vegetable food for her and some of the family as well. In addition, Prodigal Summer associates the consumption of animals with rituals that link humans to nature by commemorating their place in the natural cycle. When Lusa and Rickie sight a coyote, she refuses his offer to go home for a rifle, seek out, and kill the intruder. When he reminds her of the threat to her goats, she responds with a story: In Palestine, where my people come from, [. . .] they had this tradition of sacrificing goats. To God, theoreti- cally, but I think probably they ate them after the cer- emony. [. . .] They'd always let one goat escape and run off into the desert. The scapegoat. It was supposed to be carrying off all their sins and mistakes from that year. [. . .] I'm not such a perfect farmer that I can kill a coyote for the one kid it might take from me. There are other ways I could lose a goat through my own stupid- ity. And I'm not about to kill myself. (413) The explanation likens the coyote's actions to Lusa's and thus implies the reverse: if predators behave like humans, humans may play their part in the natural system by behaving like predators and eating whatever they can assimilate. Also, the story equates nature's contin- gencies with human error, contradicting the assumption of human</page><page sequence="14">240 ISLE dominion over nature. We cannot exert absolute control over our- selves or over our world. The reference to religious tradition evokes the feasts where the goats will be consumed. In the case of Id-al-Fitr, which concludes the month of Ramadan, the personal sacrifice of fasting parallels the ancient sacrifice of goats and commemorates the deprivation that nature can impose and that humans must accept. Even the consump- tion itself implicitly acknowledges human vulnerability to nature by invoking gratitude for its blessings. In that context, Lusa's earlier comment to Rickie that "the deal on religion between Mom and Dad was that we'd skip the guilt-and-punishment stuff and celebrate the holidays" becomes more than frivolous (153). For environmentally conscious people such as Kingsolver, feasts constitute genuine worship because, in feasting, we participate in the natural cycle even as we consciously contemplate our place in it. In "Lily's Chickens," Kingsolver identifies her family's food ethic as "along the lines of a religion" (112). In this mindful spirit, the consumption of meat is acceptable and even appropriate. Lusa's goats enable her to maintain the farm, and they represent the conscientious interaction with the natural world manifested by Kingsolver's food ethic, which encompasses far more than the appro- priate eating of animals. Kingsolver notes the waste involved in the consumption of "food that's been seeded, fertilized, harvested, pro- cessed, and packaged in grossly energy-expensive ways and then shipped, often refrigerated, for so many miles it might as well be green cheese from the moon" ("Lily's Chickens" 114). Lusa avoids such waste by cultivating her extensive and varied vegetable garden, much of it planted by Cole, and canning the products of this particu- larly fecund summer. "Between this and my chickens," she tells her sister-in-law Jewel, "I may not have to go to Kroger's again until next summer" (375). Lusa's gardening and canning represent the quintessence of the garden ethic, working with nature to sustain life at its most basic and to please the higher sensibilities as well. "I swear," Jewel affirms, "this is pretty. It looks like a woman's garden, some way. It doesn't look like other people's gardens" (375). The garden's beauty comes from contrasts that reflect Lusa's background: she has planted fava beans, eggplant, and peppers along with the more conventional corn and carrots. Human variety and ingenuity produce the garden's mul- tiple satisfactions. Lusa's prodigious canning efforts preserve those satisfactions for months to come; the filled jars of fruits and veg- etables have a beauty of their own and represent the judicious appli- cation of human knowledge to nature: "She should put in something</page><page sequence="15">Garden Ethic 241 acidic to lower the pH [. . .] would vinegar work? She added one tablespoon, a wild guess" (119). A few minutes later, Jewel confirms the lightness of Lusa's guess: "Do you put a dash of vinegar in it, or not? Oh good, you did, I can smell it" (121). Her question initially makes Lusa the authority ("do you put [...]?), but her next comment implies that she knows what to do, and confirms that Lusa has done it. The politics of this farmhouse kitchen demand the kind of deli- cacy Jewel displays, for Lusa now owns the space in which Jewel's mother and sisters have cooked all their lives, and some of the family resent her and what they consider to be her foreignness. Through a series of interactions involving gardening and canning, Jewel and Lusa gradually forge a bond that becomes the basis for Lusa's accep- tance by the family. As they fulfill fundamental human needs by pre- paring and preserving food, they also address their own needs. Lusa needs company in her grief; Jewel needs help with her children, who, like Lusa, seem strange to the rest of the family. Acknowledging those needs suggests ways to assuage them: Lusa can't imagine spending her "nothing of a life in this kitchen cooking for nobody." Jewel replies: "I wish you'd make a pie for my kids once in a while. When I come home from work I'm so tired, I practically feed them hog slop on a bun" (114, 115). This exchange foreshadows the larger problem and solution that unfold with the narrative: Jewel is dying of cancer, and Lusa eventually offers to adopt her children, not only out of regard for Jewel but also out of affection for them and for their eccentricities. Lusa's generosity earns her the respect of the family, along with her hard work: "She knew [. . .] that the family had begun to talk about how hard she worked with her hands. They seemed to respect her use of tools" (440). In addition to connecting her to her late hus- band's family, maintaining the farm gives Lusa an identity that feels like a birthright. She begins to think, as she tells Rickie, that Cole "wasn't supposed to be [her] whole life," but rather a "doorway" to herself. She imagines that self as a "landholder. Not just a mortgage holder, not just burdened, but also blessed with a piece of the world's trust. The condition forbidden to her zayda's people for more than a thousand years" (412, 413). A legal document such as a mortgage cannot fully convey that trust; it must be earned through such homely human efforts as blanching carrots and vaccinating goats. Lusa's developing sense of the meaning of ownership helps her to understand the family's concern about the farm and her possession of it. Only late in the narrative does she learn that their concern arises not out of personal animosity towards her but out of fear that she</page><page sequence="16">242 isle will remarry and the farm will pass out of the family. Living daily among the family's possessions, the evidence of the years of human effort that have earned them the landholder's trust, she comprehends the nature of their attachment and crafts a solution: she not only adopts the children but also makes them the heirs of the farm. Living there with her, they in turn can work their way into true ownership as their ancestors did before them. For Lusa, and for Kingsolver, true land ownership is never absol- ute possession: "This was still the Widener farm, but the woods were no longer the Widener woods, Lusa explained. They were nobody's" (439). The natural world cannot be possessed or bounded, and mindful farmers and gardeners must accept uncertainty and contin- gency even as they continue to act within and upon that world. Similarly, the ending of the novel requires readers to accept uncer- tainty and contingency in the lives of the characters. Though they all begin to lose their illusions of solitude, their futures, like next year's crop on the Widener farm, remain in question. Still attached to "the impalpable thread [. . .] pulling mate to mate," Lusa may find another man; Deanna's child may want a father; Garrett and Nannie's aging bodies may fail them (444). Rather than resolving their futures at the end of the novel, Kingsolver redirects readers from these human characters to the consciousness of a female coyote, reminding us again that the web of contingency connects all of the natural world, and that all actions have consequences.
