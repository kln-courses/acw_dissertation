<plain_text><page sequence="1">PIERRE FRANCASTEL Criticism and the History of Painting in the Twentieth Century Art history, like every other discipline at the present time, is under- going a transformation. Now that the outstanding works of previous ages have been inventoried, and the attempt has been made to classify them on the basis of their external characteristics, now that formal analogies have been discovered between works remote from each other in time or space, and a symbolic interpretation of figura- tive signs has been worked out, new types of investigation are being attempted. A closer link is sought, for example, between art and its social context; and by restating in more complex terms the old prob- lem of form and content, the notion of the sign-symbol is superseded and an approach made to the work's specific value as a created thing. This evolution within one discipline cannot, of course, be sepa- rated from the changes taking place in other forms of criticism. Even less readily can it be isolated from the evolution of art itself. The historian and the critic also take a hand in the game. They belong to their own age, and the contribution they can make does not repose upon some set of absolute values-this would locate them somewhere outside the world-but upon their skill in uncovering contemporary viewpoints. Each generation of critics comes upon new values in past and present, and criticism can claim to exercise a positive function to the extent that it aids in working out new esthetic values that attract living artists. Winckelman's criticism played an influential part in the development of philosophy, poetics and even politics, during the Enlightenment; and Sainte-Beuve ranks no less high than Musset when one seeks to define romanticism. In any firmly established historical perspective it is an easy matter to discern and evaluate the part played by criticism. Only those works and critical opinions survive that have become common prop- erty, and have served as the base for later developments-the be- wildering chaos of day-to-day occurrences has yielded to a few or- dered series. But, for our own time, it seems altogether arbitrary to try to predict what posterity's simplifying judgment will be. And what counts above all, one feels, is that this whole upsurge of life should not go unperceived. In this connection, the duties of the artist are quite unlike the critic's. The former is entitled to push ahead uncompromisingly, whereas the latter must situate the artist in an ideological network whose relativism knows no bounds, so that</page><page sequence="2">PIERRE FRANCASTEL he may assign him a place in his own immediategsetting and in his- tory. Hence the violence and seeming incoherence of the views expressed on contemporary art. However well aware he may be of the absolute character of artistic creation, however firmly persuaded that the artist has the right to intransigence, the critic for his part necessarily envisages a multiplicity of possible solutions, even though he may feel a marked inclination to support one of them and repudi- ate the rest. Actually, criticism ends in many instances with the voicing of a preference, and is often indistinguishable from eclecticism. This throws considerable light on the motivations of critics and historians, in the attitude to contemporary art most frequently adopted since the turn of the century. Straining for objectivity, fearful of seeing too much in forms of art that will later turn out to have been sterile, fancying themselves as prophets rather than as the analysts of their own time, they have presented panoramas of modem art and eschewed all critical judgment. They have sought to extrapolate on the basis of the past rather than to discover the connections between a living, speculative approach to artistic activity and the general tendencies, in our day, of scientific research. They have looked for enduring values, and have done much less to discern anything strik- ingly new in the creation of forms, with values that are questionable, perhaps, but which may eventually give rise to other works. Some artists and schools have had their perfervid champions, nevertheless. Critics have supported, each in its turn, the "cause" of Fauves and expressionists, of cubists and of abstract art. But some- where between a partisan attitude and an inchoate eclecticism that generally masks an absence of taste, it is not easy to say precisely where the real critic should take his stand. Some conclusions may be drawn, however, if we first reflect on the conditions in which artistic creativity must currently function. Present-day painting is characterized by the extraordinarily im- portant changes that have occurred both in painting technique and in the treatment of figures. Every age witnesses a clash of genera- tions, those who cling to the established forms confronting others who prefer innovation. But the gap that separates tradition and novelty is not always equally great. In the last fifty ears, it is un- deniable that the very notion of what painting is has undergone change. The difficulty lies in distinguishing between mere arbitrary fantasy and a proper obeisance to the spirit of the time. Art historians at the beginning of the century were ill equipped to make this distinction. The outstanding theoreticians of the pre- ceding generation, Wblfflin and Croce, held diametrically opposite views, although both accepted the dogma that art is timeless. For W6lfflin, only the individual works counted. There exist series of isolated forms; artists are connected with each other by the cyclical 99</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies development of these forms in regular, ineluctable phases; the artist is but the instrument that concretizes a kind of evolving force; a kind of anonymous art history might be conceived which would reflect only superficially the specific needs of each age. Art is identical with the formal ideal. The artist participates in this fundamental social activity only by identifying himself with a moment in the successive phases of the life of forms; the accidents of his personal existence do not concern.history. For Croce, on the contrary, the work exists only as a revelation of the artist's personality. It is the product of an activity irreducible to any other. There is no history of art, apart from the personality of the artists. There are no constraining cycles. Man is an individual and he is free. What he creates is no mere contingent thing, but partakes of the absolute of the human consciousness reflecting the universe at a given moment, and this via the individual man. There is no history transcending individualities. Art and man are freedom, in a stable universe which they play no part in shaping. It is not too much to say that all the theories and undertakings of the last fifty years go back to one or the other of these doctrinal attitudes. His- tory has been written by looking on contemporary painting either as the last link, the destructive phase of the old order, or as the result of the free imaginative activity of some dream-bearing individuals. Either the works are presented as reflecting the multiplicity of the doctrines incarnated in the "schools" (fauvism, expressionism, cu- bism, futurism), or a few "poets" are extracted from their surround- ings (Chagall, Miro, perhaps even Picasso, for his so-called "sen- sible" periods). Thus a rigid and negative view of the art of our time is built up, or, alternatively, isolated factors are magnified into a poetics of the eternally human. As a consequence, any artist today would be obliged either to circumvent or to dislocate established forms. The question may be put whether contemporary art, quite to the contrary, has not done much to retire as outworn both Wllflin's cyclical, Nietzschean notions and the personalist, demiurgic notions of a Croce. And whether, therefore, it might not be advisable, if modem art is to be considered objectively, to take into account some recently identified esthetic and technical values. There can be little temptation to defend a rigid set of principles, for we are still in the experimental stage. No full success has been achieved in attempting to apply, to the analysis of works of art, a rigid analytical formula based on a general interpretation of social phenomena. Some writers have indeed claimed that a given historical setting could be analyzed with respect to its political, social or eco- nomic features, while works of art may be left unexamined, since they are conceived to be mere products of their setting. Others de- 100</page><page sequence="4">PIERRE FRANCASTEL veloped a theory that only appeared to be vaster in scope, and spoke of "world views," attributing to every social class as such a system of general representations that necessarily were embodied in causal relationships determining all types of literary or artistic expression within a particular human group. In either case the artist is sup- posed to reflect and express his milieu while doing nothing to elabo- rate the values held in common. Applied to our own day, such doc- trines offer a clear and detailed criticism of the visual arts. The negative character of modem art is castigated, and it is regarded as the reflection of all the material and moral destructive forces that afflict us. It is alleged, too, that modern art represents the feelings of limited groups of individuals only, and has no echo among the masses-this in spite of the extraordinary vogue it now enjoys. So, after all has been said, there has been no surmounting of the dilem- ma: world view or escape from the world. This new art criticism, though with its sociological aims it claims to innovate, is really tied to traditional forms of analysis. It tries to introduce, into types of interpretation that take social factors into account, other factors that have been assembled in a traditionalist spirit. Such critics were familiar either with formal criteria that establish, not the individuality of works of art, but their connections with "reality," or they looked for the values, giving an increase of significance, which every artist-technician introduces more or less consciously into his work. Dealing with contemporary art, they were satisfied to confront modern forms with those of the past, or to analyze meaningful fac- tors common to the visual arts and the other more elevated forms of social activity: literature, music, philosophy, etc. The fact was over- looked that a new interpretation of the relations of art and society requires new methods of investigation and analysis. An intellectual discipline cannot be renewed by simply combining the old factors in new ways-first of all new phenomena must be discovered. It may well seem premature to set about uncovering the meaning of con- temporary painting in a genuinely historical perspective, but as- suredly it is possible to use the artist's living presence to study, with new methods, a style in process of formation. This does not take us outside the limits imposed on criticism, but it stresses the fact that every historical value was once contemporaneous; the past is used to clarify the present, and vice versa; the rigor of history and of true criticism alike find their justification. True criticism must en- deavor, not to propel living works forthwith into a temporal per- spective, but to show the bonds that unite artistic activity with the other forms of activity going on around the artist. In the case of a monograph, it is clear that a critical study must do more than trace the stages and phases through which the artist neces- 101</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies sarily passes. Picasso is not properly differentiated from Matisse by the statement that the one comes from cubism and the other from fauvism. These truths are not negligible, but the phenomenon Ma- tisse or Picasso is not clarified by noting his one-time adherence to a movement that countless others have gone on following, we have simply been informed of something distinct from the artist's creative personality. A description of the main trends of contemporary art relates how the public came to accept certain art forms that were developed by a few creative artists. Nothing has yet been said of their motivations or of the means they use. At this level, the opposi- tion between history and criticism is plain. Rather than consider the modes to which an artist's major works have given rise, a more essential task of criticism will be to reveal how typical works came about which are at the origin of currents and phases whose history coincides with that of modern taste. (Here there is still no question of a work's intrinsic value.) Here a new danger arises, the tendency to explain works by means of sources. At the turn of the century, Maurice Denis attached the cubists to Ingres, on the absurd ground that they were "deformers of reality." From this often espoused viewpoint the cubists, and all modem artists, are looked on as having changed, almost gratuitously, their way of representing the world. Similarly, the fauves and expres- sionists are usually associated with their great ancestors via Dela- croix. This offers no prospect of ever escaping from the notion that the aim of art is to represent the external world more or less exactly, and with greater or lesser elaborateness, the world itself remaining identical from generation to generation. Art history has thus become a description of the various ways of codifying a vision of man that remains unchanged throughout the ages. Nor is there any lack of straightforward souls who believe that, since the human eye and brain have not changed, the artist's task is to transcribe with the greatest possible fidelity the sensations recorded by the optic nerve. At the very most the artist, in his system of transposition, may make some allowance for associated factors by utilizing the symbolism in- herent in a "language" of any type. Thus the art work becomes the point of intersection of two unalterable activities. It is representa- tional, that is, it records preestablished reality; it is symbolic, that is, it has emotional nuances that associate with its visual elements values derived from other mental processes. Everything happens as though the artist were only an eye-as Monet was said to be-and as though there existed a permanent human type whose skill could convert into graphic signs elements of perception shared by all men. The inference must be that only an activity intellectual or, more precisely, literary in nature may justifiably speculate or can give in- formation about the meaning of the universe. 102</page><page sequence="6">PIERRE FRANCASTEL The development of modem painting has challenged the twin be- lief in the automatism of vision and the objective value of what is represented, on the one hand, and, on the other, in the absolute primacy of speculative thought based on the manipulation of words. Hence the passionate interest aroused, in our time, by the exercise and the understanding of the arts. That this challenge exists can be readily proved, but not as it is usually attempted. Cubism has long since been left behind, and al- ready it appears to be a final episode in the dislocation of a traditional way of seeing, not as the starting point for a new art. Let there be no misunderstanding. Cubism played a decisive part in breaking down the visual habits of modern society. Cubism it was that ac- customed us to the idea that the objects around us were not there because of some unchanging decree of providence but were the arti- facts, the transformable products of civilization. Not only the interest felt for so many exotic or dead civilizations, but the very awareness of man's power to manufacture his universe, are tied to the discovery of the object's transformable and arbitrary nature. Our age is that of a great anthropomorphic myth in which man identifies himself with the demiurge, and himself as creator of the world's forms. Scientists had much to do with this new outlook, but artists were undeniably the first to move in a world whose appearance had suddenly ceased to accord with all that had been fashioned by centuries of life in society. They outran their time, and made easier the spread of technical ac- tivities which were gradually being transposed by the speculative visions of master mathematicians. As the author of a recent book on the relations between arts and techniques in contemporary society, I found myself under attack. Eminent technicians reproached me with despising techniques and with having declared, in particular, that technicians did not create any genuine forms. My critics soon abandoned their allegation that modem techniques in their fashioning activities possessed an organic character, that a parallel existed between the growth of a flower and the perfecting of the lines of an electric locomotive. Henceforth any such notion is likely to be regarded askance. But the misunderstand- ing increased between us concerning the nature of form. In the tech- nician's eyes, to produce a new object is to create form, and the un- likeness of our vocabularies made discussion difficult. It is essential to note that only the more elevated mental processes lead to the creation of forms. Modem industry invents objects, it does not create forms. Between a frigidaire and an automobile there are such close analogies that their external forms tend to become identical. So great is the fascination exerted upon our epoch by the visual arts that the unifying effect of the forms created is undeniable. In earlier ages also the rules of good taste in the esthetic domain were trans- 103</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies ferred to manual skills. But today the transformation of physical and intellectual utensils is so complete that new forms enter into daily life with exceptional rapidity. Care should nevertheless be taken to distinguish between genuine forms and the countless ways in which they are put to use. One might express this view most controversially by saying that artists and mathematicians alone create forms, i.e., modes of material as- sociation that involve the assemblage and presentation of representa- tive elements of a speculative activity. I met with violent protests when I declared that Picasso or Matisse, Esteve or Gischia had done more than the car manufacturers to transform the material universe around us. On a purely numerical basis, of course, my assertion would be untenable. If one maintains, however, that the work of art is a "type," and that technical and artistic activities have radically different aims, the former seeking to multiply objects and the latter to renew forms, then all opposition is eliminated. But it becomes clear that the artists' contribution is a significant one, for they first detached many groups of people from their traditional way of seeing the universe as a form identical for everyone and, with the mathema- ticians, first proposed systems of relations sufficiently generalized to be used both by a machine manufacturer and by a mythologist. There can be indeed not the least doubt that 20th-century painters have done much to familiarize us with the ideas that dominate our lives. As a single example I shall refer to the problem of the dimen- sions of the universe. At the turn of the century, when artists took it up, this was a matter of speculation only for a very few scientific and technical minds. Of course the artists did not always understand it, and the supposed addition of a fourth dimension, by cubists and futurists, was an illusion or even a sham, at least when painters tried to apply pseudo-scientific principles to their art. No new system of interpreting the universe can be created by simply picking up new elements and adding them to the factors hitherto employed. Only the transformation of all the elements used can create a coherent system with new dimensions. As a consequence, the claims put for- ward by Seurat, like those of Boccioni, were bound to meet defeat. On the other hand, when artists tried, not to take over into their visual patterns more or less adequately assimilated scientific lessons, but to achieve by means proper to painting new combinatory systems of sensations and spatial organization, then they did succeed in cre- ating new fields of sensation possessing homogeneous characteristics. One may say that they offered a vision of space endowed with new dimensions. With Matisse or Leger, the relationship between signs is quite close to a mathematician's concept of space. It is based on 104</page><page sequence="8">PIERRE FRANCASTEL the possibility of isolating certain elements of reality, without regard to any possibility of handling them physically. Forms that are un- related in everyday life are thus depicted, mingling elements derived from direct observation with others that are, not arbitrary, but rep- resentative of sensations coming from memory or the imagination. The artist provides sense recollections with a body, he brings alive constellations familiar to his eye and mind, he makes of them the figurative objects of a new space, he associates past and present in a new way. There are veritable new dimensions in his canvases. While mathematicians evolve their topologies, painters invent imaginary forms and objects whose relations with reality are of a psychological type unknown until then. They have thus helped to spread notions on which our current understanding of the universe is based. They have provided concrete nourishment for an age that no longer at- tempts to describe objects assembled by non-human agencies but which, in every domain, and from the very instant of perception, seeks to impose a human order on the external world. The lofty speculations of science have revealed an atomic universe at the same time as artists are creating a universe of dynamic signs in which color, especially, acquires a new value. Ceasing to endow preexistent objects with variable characteristics, at the will of the observer, it engenders, all by itself, configurations that evoke the universe. Made up of measurable vibrations, it establishes, as Robert Delaunay in his first really abstract canvases of 1912 and 1913 was able to show, an immediate relationship between man and universal space. It is depth, and can be measured along coordinates both rhythmic and emotive. The transformation of the relations between line and color corresponds to a synchronous transformation in paint- ing technique and human sensibility. The breaking up of the old visual frameworks of the universe has enabled our age to metamor- phose its mores and to look for new values. And artists have un- questionably been among the first to realize concretely a 20th-century type of man, passionately adventurous and passionately introspective. The evolution of modern art, therefore, is not simply destructive of the traditional forms of vision. There is a creative quality in what it assembles. It cannot be maintained that the goal is in sight, that a new system has been discovered to accord with a prolonged experi- ence. But scientists are equally remote from the end. Let it suffice to say that both artists and scientists offer our generation destructive factors and factors that make possible a new sort of domination over matter. Many historians fail to grasp what is occurring before their eyes because they do not realize that genesis does not necessarily take place in the conditions required for synthesis. Here again, criticism and history stand opposed. It is a grave error, vis-h-vis new art works, to force them into the continuum of some formal concep- 105</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies tion of history. The works of the past have also, at times, repre- sented an epoch of radical transformation. To begin with, they were misunderstood and attacked; today we judge them in terms of the achievements that have been made under the stimulus of their action and example. Not every experiment currently being undertaken will prove equally fecund. To claim to distinguish at this moment the lasting values that the future will find in the present is to play at prophecy. The future is not restricted to the possibilities being ex- plored today. The place remains for new creations, and they alone can lend value and efficacy to the tentative solutions we witness now. The speculative activity of modem art is not a kind of equation whose solution has merely to be worked out, it invites artists and the public to take part in a dialectical process. That is why the panorama of present-day art is both various and unique, rigidly determined yet open to new hypotheses. Just as there exists a progression of scien- tific thought that shuttles ceaselessly between speculation and experi- ment, similarly a visual thought process exists that moves perpetually between observation and hypothesis. Art is a problematics, like logical thought, within the imaginary. The only attitude that cuts off every avenue of development and every understanding of art's value is the conviction of a completely perfect correspondence between the forms of art and the forms of life.
