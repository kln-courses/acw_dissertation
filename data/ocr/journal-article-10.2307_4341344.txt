<plain_text><page sequence="1">Das griechische Antlitz in Meisterwerken der Munzkunst. By LEO and MARIA LANCKOR- ONSKI. 72 pages, 25 plates. Pantheon Akademische Verlagsanstalt, (Amsterdam I940) (Albae Vigiliae, Heft 3) (3.40 M-) This handsomely illustrated monograph is a brief study of the engraver's art of the fifth and fourth cen- turies. It includes twenty-five well-known coins with the heads of divinities from Elis, Athens, Syracuse, Carthage, Cnidos and elsewhere. These have been photographed and enlarged with special care to the lighting in order that they may be studied as sculp- tuire. Accompanying each type is a discussion of pas- sages pertaining to the gods portrayed from Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and others. The authors believe that the coins, like literature and other art, are documents of Greek life and Greek culture. In them are reflected man's concepts of the gods; the very characteristics attributed by the poet to the gods are to be found engraved upon the faces. Furthermore, as the anthropomorphism of the Greeks changes in literature, so it changes in art. The early coins show the Homeric god: majestic, symbolic, re- ligious, a complete idealization of man. When this oneness of man and god disappears from Greek thought and the two worlds, human and divine, are separated, art presents its gods as individuals, more earthy, life- like and realistic. Only one of the examples offered in support of this thesis is really convincing. This is the series of Syra- cusan coins showing the head of Arethusa issued be- tween 480 and 380. But here the authors do not asso- ciate the types with specific literary passages; they merely show. that the art of the engraver, like that of the sculptor, follows the pattern of Greek thought in broad general lines. The change from the idealized to the individualized deity on the coins is quite obvious. The earliest head is serene and noble, an idealized picture and personification of youthful maidenhood. The later coins show a fully developed woman and, what is more important, in its details the face is more realistic. Eyes and ears are in their correct places; pupils, lids, eyelashes, eyebrows are shown. The head dress of each type varies. The whole impression is freer and more lifelike. Less sucessful than the example of the Arethusa head are those in which the authors seek to find the poet's words in the artist's work. The fault really lies with the poet, as it were, because his words are general and abstract and offer no sure guide to the physical appearance of his god. Thus, while it is comparatively easy to see the difference between an archaic eye and one which is executed in correct per- spective, it is not so simple to see in the Zeus head on the coin of Elis the "schlichte Grosse und vater- liche Milde" described by Homer and Hesiod. Nor can we readily see with the authors in the Hera head the "bliihende Hera" of Hesiod or the "erhaben, mit funkelnden Augen, stoltz, hoheitzvoll blickend" goddess of Homer. To be sure, the Attic helmet of the Athena head makes this divinity resemble the Homeric goddess of war, but we can say the same of a strong chin, a sharp nose, a heroic position of the head, a con- sciously executed archaic smile? In the case of the Aphrodite heads, the association of the literary passages with the coins is not quite so strained. The Homeric Hymn describes the beautiful goddess with ear rings and necklace and so she appears on the coins of Cnidos. "Die kokette Haartracht, das zierliche Halskettchen und das schmiickende Ohrgehange sind willige Diener der Lockungen das Antlitzes, das in all seinen Linien den Liebeszauber der G6ttin ausdriickt." Purely subjective is the authors' conclusion about the Hermes head. To them the god appears as "klugen, kraftigen, werktatigen Landmannes" behind which traits is "das Leuchten des Olympiers." It is a tempting task to compare the arts. Here, how- ever, the literary passages cited are too general to be of any safe critical use. Can we really know what Homer's omnipotent, omniscient god of gods and men looked like? A more satisfactory task, we think, would be to compare the numismatic types with those of sculpture, a study in which little work has been done but so much is needed. It is the recent vogue in numismatic literature which brings this fine set of enlarged photographs. The plates will make excellent slides. Incomplete as the collection is, the young student of Greek literature can know what at least the ancient artist thought of some of his gods. The book is not documented except for line reference to the passages cited and for brief numismatic notices. BLUMA L. TRELL HUNITER COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
