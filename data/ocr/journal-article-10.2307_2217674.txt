<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Christian Knowledge of God. By H. P. OWEN. (London: The Athlone Press. 1969. Pp. vii + 341. Price 80s.) Here is a peppery treatise that fights every inclination to bend to the popular winds of secular compromise. In this fact alone it is astonishing-at least within the current climate in the United States, where orthodoxy like this may still occasionally be held but is seldom defended in university circles. But this is not a book to be lightly dis- missed. It is argued with energy and determination, whatever its ultimate power to convince; and consequently it deserves notice among those who had supposed that positions such as it advocates were no longer seriously in contention. Owen defends Christian theism-and by this he specifies the " classical " theism of supernatural absolutism-as standing far superior to all its rivals as an intellectual position. The traditional cosmological, teleological, and moral proofs are embraced as sound, though not ultimately coercive to hard-core unbelievers who may refuse (to their own impoverishment though without logical contradiction) to acknowledge the principle of sufficient reason. Discursive reason, having shown that God is the best "metaphysical hypothesis ", then gives way to first-hand intellectual intuition by which the hypothetical mode is replaced by the categorical, and knowledge-certain knowledge-of God becomes the normative Christian's normal possession. Even the fact of evil, which Owen acknowledges as the one real difficulty for his view, is no ultimate problem as long as God can be certainly known on other grounds. Then, as Owen says: "A believer could put the matter thus. 'Since I am independently con- vinced of God's existence, and since I see significance in some suffering, it is reasonable for me to believe that the remainder is meaningful for God even though it seems meaningless to me. I further hold that my inability to see the providential meaning of all suffering is consonant with the basic mystery of God's being and with the fact that he constantly imposes intellectual, as well as moral, trials for the purification of our faith' " (p. 118). By such arguments, Owen concludes, "the theistic postulate can be shown to be rationally superior to any alternative " (p. 334). In questing this grail, of course, a great many paths have to be explored and a great many dragons slain. On one side are the philosophical theologians who are daring to tamper with the fundamental categories of Aristotelian-Thomistic ways of con- ceiving God. To counter this danger on his flank, Owen chooses to attack the dipolar theism of Charles Hartshorne as "a self-contradictory piece of anthropomorphism " (p. 107). I shall leave it to Hartshorne himself, a warrior at least as doughty as Owen, to make his inevitable reply to the paragraphs that lead to this characterization, but one may fear that Owen sometimes lays about him with more force than accuracy, especially when he does battle outside familiar territory and traditional distinctions. The main weight of Owen's attack, however, falls on unbelieving philosophers who challenge Christianity's cognitive credentials. Antony Flew, whom Owen calls "the most persistent among the living critics of theism ", has a longer list of references in the book's index than any other current author (the two next most frequently cited contemporaries are Owen's allies E. L. Mascall afid I. T. Ramsey); and it is Flew's verificationist position that Owen is determined to refute. This he attempts by main- taining that religious intuitions do in fact verify theistic claims much as sense perceptions verify statements about the world. The two subject matters are very different, of course, and the verifying experiences are correspondingly diverse; but logically the Christian is entitled to consider his belief certainly verified as long as his experience is what should, according to his theories, be expected in the light of God's absolutely sui generis nature. This brings us back to theories, and to the question of Owen's success in showing the superiority of classical theism in purely intellectual terms, as he claims to do.</page><page sequence="2">412 BOOK REVIEWS Everything hangs on this, for Owen. The only philosophically viable reason for accept- ing orthodox theism is, Owen insists, that it provides greater intelligibility than any alternative position, and he welcomes the criteria of " consistency ", " coherence ", and " explanatory power " in the enterprise of displaying Christian knowledge. This is admirable, in my judgment, as a programme; and Owen works hard to live up to its rigors. But in the light of this it is baffling to observe the ease and frequency with which Owen allows himself the appeal to unfathomable mystery, necessary agnosticism, and the via negativa. Space forbids a full development of this criticism, but a few examples may suggest the problem. Owen praises the cosmological argument for completing " in its own mode the quest for intelligibility " (p. 87), on the grounds that the God who explains all else, " being One whose essence is identical with existence . . . is self-explanatory " (p. 86). But in the same chapter he has already firmly asserted: "We cannot even form an analogy to self-existence (as we can form analogies to its spiritual attributes) ; for there is nothing in our finite life which is even a faint copy of it. It remains a total mystery " (p. 79). What now has happened to the quest for intelligibility ? How are we to con- ceive its " completion " being effected by appeal to what is " total mystery " ? Again, though he has earlier carefully distinguished paradox from self-contradiction on the basis of the former's openness to logical resolution, Owen takes refuge in the following exercise in " intelligibility ": " None of our images and concepts enables us to comprehend God's virtue; they all indicate the incomprehensibility of the nature which, nevertheless, we apprehend. Hence we must negate all our images (often by allowing them to negate each other). Similarly, if we try to construct a conceptual formula which will convey the truth we can do so only by a deliberate paradox . . . which takes us to the extreme limit of the via negativa. Yet though our symbolization must contain an irresolvable [sic !] element of paradox it is not self-contradictory" (pp. 243-244). Other examples of Owen's double standard-hitting hard at others for alleged contradictions or unintelligible assertions while claiming for himself the privilege of recourse to mystery and unresolvable paradox-might be multiplied at will. He accuses those who call God " supra-personal " of using words meaninglessly (p. 231), but two pages earlier he seems to see no problem in noting that " Christians affirm that personal attributes inhere positively in God, although they cannot comprehend the form, or mode, of inherence. Therefore they use the via negativa, not to deny personality per se, but to deny its finite aspects and to affirm its infinite subsistence " (p. 229). Likewise the promised " explanatory " power of the God-hypothesis is shattered, one would think, by Owen's acknowledgement that there is absolutely no way to conceive God's relation to temporal existence (p. 220). Nor is there any way of thinking about how God " acts ": "All God's actions are hidden and incomprehensible. They are hidden in their media; we can never even partially unveil them for inspection. They are also incomprehensible; we cannot conceive their forms of operation by anal- ogy with our own acts of will. All our analogies . .. point to an unfathomable mystery" (pp. 224-225). This book contains much that could keep philosophers busy for some time. It is warmly argued, wide ranging, and it fills the need for a bona fide champion of rational orthodoxy that has been evident for some time. Unfortunately it will function for some merely as a target, for others merely as a shield. In general it will reinforce the stereotypes of those who already suppose that this sort of battling over well-bloodied turf is all there is or can be to philosophy of religion. Because of these effects at a time when, in my judgment, our keenest need is for fresh approaches to all the questions of religion, I cannot welcome the appearance of this book with great enthusiasm; but it is here and it is, of its kind, an impressive effort.
