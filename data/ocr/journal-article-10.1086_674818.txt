         <p>Michel Beheim (d. ca. 1474), a prolific writer, musical composer, and promoter of Augustinian lay spirituality in the pre-Reformation period, is perhaps best known for his poetic service to the Habsburg emperor Friedrich III (1461–1465).<sup>1</sup> Author of a wide range of writings (chronicles, political poems, love songs, fables, moral and ethical poetry, autobiographical songs, ballads, advice to rulers, exempla, lyrics to the Virgin Mary, and religious song cycles), Beheim set each to music and supervised the recording of each in manuscripts. His audience consisted mainly of secular nobles, for whom he assumed the role of pedagogue in verse and song, treating ethical issues and church doctrine. His is popular piety of the first order; his theological stance was orthodox to the extreme: he directed sharp words at Hussites, Jews, and Turks.<sup>2</sup> This essay discusses his two song-poems on the allegorical figure Frau Welt, both with a terminus ad quem of 1457.<sup>3</sup> The first of these, <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib, was vorn schan und hinden schraglich</italic> (A moral lesson about a woman, beautiful in front and frightful at the back) (no. 279), hereafter <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>,<sup>4</sup> is composed in his <italic>Trummetenweise</italic> ; the second, <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> (A moral lesson concerning the world) (no. 448),<sup>5</sup> is set to his <italic>Lange Weise</italic>.</p>
         <p>Frau Welt, emerging in the thirteenth century in the German cultural zone, is, to borrow a phrase from Linda Ellen Feldman, “a paradigm of feminine corruption and masculine corruptibility.”<sup>6</sup> Intended to be a negative example of the secular realm and devotion thereto, she appears (sometimes identified simply as <italic>figura mundi</italic>) in literature, artistic illustrations, and sculpture.<sup>7</sup> Consistently authors and artists depict the vain and beguiling world as a ravishing, lascivious noblewoman who is courted assiduously by a foolish liege man, standing for mankind. His reward for devotion to the woman-as-world is death and the loss of his soul.<sup>8</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Extraordinarily lovely, Frau Welt uses her agreeable appearance to entice her victims, dazzling and blinding their senses. Like the world, which hides its horrors from its deluded servants, Frau Welt bewitches her subjects with a pleasing exterior. Her beauty is, however, confined to her front side. Seen from the front, she is gorgeous; but when she turns around, her back harbors a malodorous cavity, filled with toads, snakes, spiders, and vermin.<sup>9</sup> This twofold nature exposes, in the words of Prudence Allen, “the disparity between appearance and reality.”<sup>10</sup> Seen theologically, Frau Welt embodies the biblical admonition “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world” (nolite diligere mundum neque ea quae in mundo sunt) (1 John 2:15).</p>
         <p>Repulsive creatures, decomposition, and foul stench thus express the essence of the world, a place of illusion and delusion, its beauty concealing a moral lowness of which sinners should beware. And the tangible form of contempt for temporal existence is Frau Welt, with whose lore Michel Beheim was intimately conversant. We will argue that he knew both the literary and pictorial renderings of the allegory, the former most prominently represented by Walther von der Vogelweide (d. ca. 1230) and Konrad von Würzburg (d. 1287), <sup>11</sup> and the latter by the manuscript, wood cut, and broadside illustrations in which Frau Welt becomes the emblem of, and repository for, the deadly sins.<sup>12</sup>
         </p>
         <p>This visual tradition influenced his depiction of Frau Welt in one of our song-poems under review, specifically when Beheim describes Frau Welt as wearing a wreath with seven flowers that betoken the sins. A further aspect of his debt to visual representations of Frau Welt is his willingness to merge the identities of Frau Welt and the whore of Babylon, as artists do when they show the tempter holding the golden cup of Revelation 17:4. Beheim manipulates the contours of the Frau Welt allegory, even using the landscape and clichés of his own erotic verse for the encounter of the world-as-woman and her love-servant. The result is an amalgam of word and picture, a blend of genres and media that configures the allegory as exemplum.<sup>13</sup>

         <title>Ain beispiel von ainem weib</title>
         <p>The first of Beheim’s treatments of Frau Welt (no. 279), <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> (A moral lesson about a woman),<sup>14</sup> has long been known to scholarship.<sup>15</sup> In fact, Wolfgang Stammler, in his seminal monograph on Frau Welt, prints out the full text in an appendix as illustrative of the tradition.<sup>16</sup> Strangely, however, there is little critical analysis of <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>, although it articulates the thematic complex and encapsulates Beheim’s theory of art. Wearing the mantle of prophet and preacher, Beheim castigates those whose vision is so beclouded by worldly love that they fail to grasp the demonic, poisonous essence of the secular realm, whose perniciousness is buried from superficial sight.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The song-poem, eighty verses with no known source text,<sup>18</sup> is related as a first-person lover’s confession. It contains a formulaic springtime opening scene common to German medieval love lyrics. The poetic “I,” a mounted courtier, encounters a mysterious, dazzlingly beautiful, and wonderfully well-spoken woman on the heather and falls immediately in love. She is wearing a flowered wreath. Blending the conventions of the courtly love lyric with (fictional) autobiography, Beheim presents himself as a devoted suitor, eager to volunteer his faithful love-service to the woman: “Ich… sprach, ich welt ir diener sein” (I proclaimed that I wished to become her servant) (line 43).<sup>19</sup> Deliberately, it would seem, he is here mimicking the gesture of devotion that is depicted in medieval church sculpture: on the south portal of the Cathedral of Worms, for example, a statue of Frau Welt from the early fourteenth century looms over a tiny, adoring knight who is clutching her knees.<sup>20</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The lady and her ardent servant in Beheim’s verses consummate their love. She then says it is time for her to leave. When she does so, her suitor catches sight of her ulcerous back. He sees maggots, worm-maws, pus-filled tissue, and dead, putrefying flesh and claims that he had never smelled anything to equal it. Toads, adders, and snakes hang from her back.</p>
         <p>The poetic first person now becomes the decoder of the song-poem, an exegete who knows to look beyond the phantasm that is the world. All has been a parable; everything stands for something else. Echoing the religious seer’s voice in Revelation 17:7—“I will tell you the mystery” (ego tibi dicam sacramentum), the omniscient voice now divulges the significance of the woman, her wreath of flowers, and her lover-servant:</p>
         <disp-quote>

               </attrib>
            </verse-group>
            <p>[Can you guess who this woman is? I identify her as the world. The wreath that she bore upon her head, composed of seven flowers: these blooms betoken the seven capital vices.]</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>The moral of this exemplum is that nothing in this world is as it seems. The pastoral realm, in Beheim’s analysis, is mere decoration, lacking substance; the woman is the world, crowned with sin; and the blinded servant is mankind, whose perceptive faculties are sufficiently flawed to allow him to be seduced by a world that cloaks its horrors with false splendor.</p>
         <p>The audience receives here a presumably familiar story, more than two-thirds of which is narrative, leaving a brief portion for augury and admonition. In the compressed scenario the speaker wears no less than three masks: love-servant, exegete, and warning prophet. In the first of these roles he portrays the representative human being; in the second he becomes the insightful sage who knows how to interpret the allegory; and finally, he is the preacher, calling sinners to God. Two strong themes are struck, both following a common thread, but distinct: contempt for the world and the warning example of the lover of the world. The task of the audience is to take the love-servant as a negative example and so rethink its allegiance to this world. The counterexample, so the speaker admonishes the audience, is the person whose gaze rests on eternity and who recognizes God, not the world, as the rightful overlord.</p>
         <p>Previous scholarship on <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> highlights two aspects: literary tradition and genre. The first of these situates the Frau Welt of <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> in the tradition of the femme fatale. This Barbara Becker-Cantarino does convincingly, citing Beheim’s song-poem as an important document affirming Frau Welt as “eine dämonische Figur, eine Verführerin, die nicht durch ihre materielle Macht (Gold und Besitz) sondern durch ihre Person, ihre Sexualität (z.B. Schönheit), die Männer ins Verderben stürzt” (a demonic figure, a temptress, who brings men to ruin by her person and her sexuality [for example, her beauty], not by means of material power [money and possessions]).<sup>22</sup> As femme fatale, Frau Welt belongs to a type that Ellis Dye has argued includes ”the sirens and harpies of antiquity, Calypso, Venus, Helen of Troy, Armida, Eve, Delilah, Jezebel, Judith, Salome, the Medusa, and numerous sphinxes, nymphs and Amazons.”<sup>23</sup> In <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>, Beheim adopts the traditional combination of traits associated with Frau Welt; his treatment is of a piece with the misogynous image of women in scholastic theology of the Middle Ages, as Becker-Cantarino reminds the reader.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>With regard to genre, Manfred Kern calls attention to the hybrid quality of <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>. He views it as straddling literary types, the love song and the admonitory allegory. The love song on which it plays, relying for effect on deep verbal and thematic connections, is Beheim’s own composition, <italic>Von plumen und von varwen</italic> (Concerning flowers and colors) (no. 337). Beheim thus offers both a “pure” love song in the pastoral tradition, and a grotesque allegory of secular love, using amorous images from his own canon. Kern labels <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> a frightening pastoral poem (“schauderhafte Pastorella”),<sup>25</sup> which suggests it is only apparently a love poem. In both works, Beheim’s love-slave, speaking in the first person, enters a field of grass in springtime. Obeying the conventions of the topos of the <italic>locus amoenus</italic>, the pleasant place in each song-poem is filled with flowers, vegetation, bird song—and love. In a natural setting the poetic persona encounters a gorgeous woman, falls deeply in love, compares her to an angel, and wishes to become her servant. In both works, a wreath made of flowers appears, and the woman claims she must depart, leaving the singer-servant alone in a landscape of love’s longing.</p>
         <p>Kern is less successful in explaining what moved Michel Beheim to create a <italic>contrafact</italic> to his own composition. In other words, why would he cite his own love poetry only to overlay word and music with a deep refutation of the subject matter, making a quasi–love song a sermon on the putrefactive, stinking nature of human existence? Our thesis regarding his reframed love song is that Beheim intends <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> to expose, through parallelism, the triviality of the entire genre of secular erotic verse. The pastoral, with its Arcadian landscape of lovers’ seduction—in fact, any verse celebrating the ardor of men and woman on the heath in the spring season—displays to his eyes a hollow core, once the trivial subject matter is juxtaposed with images of mortality and salvation, in particular, the image of Frau Welt.</p>
         <p>The medieval German poet most closely associated with the pastoral is Tannhäuser (thirteenth century).<sup>26</sup> Legends surround this author, who becomes linked to Frau Welt in the later period—for example, in a (specifically didactic) Shrovetide play of Beheim’s era.<sup>27</sup> In that drama, Tannhäuser and an allegorical figure, World (<italic>werlt</italic>), engage in a disputation centering on the joys of the world (<italic>freuden/wunne</italic>) and the anguish that the singer feels after having spent time in bondage to the World. Tannhäuser has come to the realization that the temporal realm can give him no joy, only sadness and harm. To entice the poet to remain in her service, the World enumerates those things in this life bringing joy: violets, roses, lilies—and a laughing, red mouth. Tannhäuser responds by lamenting the time he has spent in temporal service. Still trying to seduce the singer, the World promises to conduct him to the fields of joy (<italic>der freuden gevilde</italic>). Such joy, Tannhäuser states as a rejoinder, is unsound and wretched, and he escapes the clutches of the World.</p>
         <p>Beheim affirms the bond between the figure of Frau Welt and love lyrics in emulation of poets like Tannhäuser in <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>. This song-poem is no anomaly in Beheim’s canon. Although it is extreme—and grotesque—it is not an orphan in its use of erotic imagery to make a theological point. On the whole, “pure” love songs are the least represented among Beheim’s works. He knows all the rhetorical conventions and tries his hand at a range of song types: dance songs; dawn songs; spring, winter, and autumn songs; laments on love; songs extolling the beloved; and reflection on the foolishness and disappointments of love.<sup>28</sup> Most are filled with stereotypical expressions and situations evoking the lyric poetry of Tannhäuser and the school of Neidhart von Reuenthal (fl. 1230), to name but two prototypes.</p>
         <p>Beheim seldom celebrates love for its own sake, however, but organizes love songs around the opposition between terrestrial and divine love. In the process, traditionally secular images, such as the falcon and aristocratic falconer, attain religious significance.<sup>29</sup> For example, in one song-poem Beheim explains that the noble falconer (<italic>der edel valkener</italic>) (no. 300, 64) represents the Holy Ghost. In another, he interprets the May-time and summer of his apparent love song as a sign of God’s having revealed his progeny to man (no. 284, 47–48). And in yet another, he explains that the brief joys of May equate with the transient concerns of the temporal realm (no. 353, 57–60). It becomes plain that Michel Beheim assigned no special status to love songs without a religious imprint, viewing these and the vocabulary of courtly wooing with suspicion. But <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> is more than a simple philippic against the world. No doubt, Beheim was suspicious of secular amorous verse, which he deemed trivial and dangerous. But his suspicion bordered on aversion. The poet invites us, by virtue of a somber vision that juxtaposes pastoral topoi of romantic love with the motif of Frau Welt, to identify the entire genre of secular love poetry as itself a <italic>figura mundi</italic>. To his mind, love songs and Frau Welt are analogous, corresponding in function. They combine in their celebration of artifice, illusion, carnality, and slavish devotion of singer to lady. And both are nourished by the moral blindness of bedazzled admirers who confound the vanity of pleasing exteriors with eternal truth. To penetrate the surface of erotic verse, it follows, is to recognize that its bliss is chimerical and ephemeral; its focus on earthly emotion an impediment to spiritual life; and its beauty conceals poisonous evil.</p>
         <p>Beheim’s explicit decoding of the allegory of Frau Welt with moral certainty is consistent with his artistic stance as a lay theologian in song. One of his creations is an elaborate cycle on the deadly sins (after 1457), consisting of verses that explicate and castigate transgression against the moral code (nos. 164–202). <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> is not a part this cycle, but the “seven capital sins” (die siben habet sund) (line 72) are important to the message of our text. The flowers that make up the <italic>weib</italic> ’s chaplet stand for the deadly sins, with which the world is <italic>gar upiglichen…bekrănt</italic> (garlanded beyond all measure) (line 73). The woman who wears the coronal of flowers is the world (<italic>ich zel es zu der welte</italic>) (line 69), as in a fifteenth-century German woodcut of Frau Welt, “an emblematic figure of the world.”<sup>30</sup> This wreath/wreathlet (<italic>krancz</italic>/<italic>krenczlin</italic>) has a rich tradition. It is a fully ambivalent symbol, signaling on the one hand a wedding, victory, and fame, but on the other death and mourning.<sup>31</sup> Beheim skillfully connects these opposing associations by making the lady’s garland of flowers in the first part of the song-poem a sign of the triumph of love. In Roman mythology, the flowered chaplet is worn by Flora, goddess of flowers and protector of spring.<sup>32</sup> Flora’s wreath is her diadem, intended to convey her sovereignty and her protective powers. In German literature, one must think of the love songs of Tannhäuser—mentioned above—who speaks of floral wreaths and springtime frolics.<sup>33</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The lady wearing the wreath in the first part of <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> is best interpreted as a stock figure in conventional erotic verse (cheeks as white as lilies, mouth like a ruby, etc.). She joins company with Flora and the literary maidens courted by singers in a long tradition of love songs. In the second part of Beheim’s song-poem, however, the garland of flowers is no longer the domain of earthly song. As the diadem of Frau Welt, the wreath is an emblem of death—not love. The floral wreath she wears becomes a funeral wreath. All lovers of this world are the implied participants in the funeral over which Frau Welt presides.</p>
         <p>The garland in <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> replaces the traditional crown that Frau Welt wears in poetry and in the arts. The flowers of the seven deadly sins oppose the metaphorical flowers of virtue. In the fourth century, Ambrose speaks of St. Agnes, for instance, as wearing a bride’s wreath made up of goodness and virtue.<sup>34</sup> In Beheim’s era one thinks of a reference to <italic>flores virtutum</italic> in a didactic work by Hans Vintler (fl. 1411).<sup>35</sup> The opposite rhetorical figure is what one may call “negative wreaths,” whereby a sinner’s transgressions make up a crown of flowers.<sup>36</sup> One of these garlands woven from vice appears in a German poem by Oswald von Wolkenstein (d. 1445), where the figure of Death presents the speaker with a wreath fabricated from the sins that he has committed. Here the sins are not specifically identified as the deadly sins but are only vaguely alluded to:</p>

            </verse-group>
            <p>[I am summoned to a dance, at which a large wreath of all my sins will be offered to me. I must pay the bill.]</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Certainly Michel Beheim drew on one of these traditions associating flowers, sin, and wreaths/crowns. The difficulty lies in determining which one. Not yet proposed in scholarship is that he took his inspiration from the pictorial arts, which is our argument here.</p>
         <p>In late medieval illustrations two depictions of Frau Welt may profitably be considered. Although neither contains the exact equivalent of Beheim’s garland with flowers of evil, each is suggestive enough to allow for speculation that he encountered some such rendering. The first is a lavishly illustrated figure drawing of Frau Welt by the illuminator Heinrich Aurhaym as a marginal illustration in MS Cpg 329 (Heidelberg). A pictorial composition in full color, it accompanies a song-poem on the allegory by Hugo von Montfort (d. 1423).<sup>38</sup> She stands facing the viewer, with her right hand raised in an attitude of warning. In her left hand is a banderole, on which her name appears in the spelling: <italic>Fraw Werlt</italic>. On her head is a green garland with eight yellow flowers—roses—in view. This portrayal of Frau Welt is framed by the initial “F,” and thus provides the letter for the first verse of the song-poem: “Fro Welt, ir sint gar húpsch und schón” (Dame World, you are courtly and comely) (line 1). Her image is inspired by six verses, the first four from the mouth of Frau Welt, while the last two are the knight’s response:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <verse-group>
               <verse-line>“… gang zú mir</verse-line>
               <verse-line>und spring mit fróden an den tantz</verse-line>
               <verse-line>—das wil ich sicher raten dir—,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>setz auff dein haupt ain rosen krantz!”</verse-line>
               <verse-line>“Das tantzen hán ich verhaissen:</verse-line>
               <verse-line>kain schappel getrag ich niemer me.”</verse-line>
               <attrib>(13–18)<sup>39</sup>
               </attrib>
            </verse-group>
            <p>[“Come to me, and dance, joyously! This I advise you. Place a wreath of roses on your head!” / “Dancing I have foresworn. I shall nevermore wear a garland/chaplet!”]</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>The poetic situation involves a disputation between Frau Welt and a would-be servitor knight, who rejects her advances. Aurhaym paints the wreath that Frau Welt had offered the knight, but places it on her head, not in her hand. The eight roses are carefully rendered, each with five petals, thus approximating the heraldic roses appearing on shields and emblems of the Middle Ages.</p>
         <p>This manuscript illustration proves that Frau Welt wore a wreath of flowers as an emblem of temptation—and this in Beheim’s century. In the song-poem proper, Hugo von Montfort borrows the love song rhyme <italic>kranz/tanz</italic> (wreath/dance), turning the association into a kind of dance of death. (Aurhaym portrays Frau Welt as standing alone; it is not clear whether she has already offered her wreath to her intended servant.) Looking beyond the obvious differences between Beheim’s version and Hugo’s own—for instance, the kind and number of flowers, and the fact that Beheim mentions no dancing scene—it is plain that the chief attribute of Frau Welt is a floral wreath of sin, as in Beheim’s verses. Aurhaym renders her wreath so outsized that it is the dominant visual image, attracting the viewer’s eye as her natural crown.</p>
         <p>Since the song-poems of Hugo von Montfort and Michel Beheim are collected in Heidelberg manuscripts, it is tempting to believe that the younger author had access to the illustration in Hugo’s collection.<sup>40</sup> Be that as it may, it is sufficient to know that Frau Welt appeared in a drawing in the fifteenth century wearing a floral wreath.</p>
         <p>Another work of art deserves mention, one coinciding with the reconfiguration of the anatomy of Frau Welt that had begun in the fourteenth century in the German cultural region. Here she unambiguously wears a crown of sin. But more than this, she is confected of sin: her body parts and attributes (e.g., a bow and arrow) represent the deadly sins. One such depiction of the corporeally sinful Frau Welt is executed in ink in the <italic>Krumauer Bilderkodex</italic>, a Bohemian <italic>Biblia pauperum</italic> from around 1360.<sup>41</sup> The drawing places the word <italic>superbia</italic> over her crown. The symbol of pride, her crown is made of peacock feathers.<sup>42</sup> The feathers in the drawing are rooted in some sort of vegetation, leading Eckart Conrad Lutz to characterize Frau Welt’s head covering as a crown of leaves (<italic>Laubkrone</italic>).<sup>43</sup> What Lutz sees in the illustration as foliage could just as well be flowers, however, placed among the peacock feathers. If flowers are indeed on the crown of Frau Welt, then one finds here a model of some sort for Beheim’s own floral diadem.</p>
         <p>The suggestion that Frau Welt’s floral crown was inspired by the pictorial arts takes us to the radical refiguration of the allegory beginning in the fourteenth century. In the later German Middle Ages, she not only fully changes physiognomy but also comes to represent the deadly sins, becoming the anthropomorphic figuration of vice.<sup>44</sup> Her bodily members, as Susanne Blöcker has said in reference to one of the illustrations, point to particular sins.<sup>45</sup> Given various names in art and in art criticism (<italic>figura mundi</italic>, <italic>Siebenlasterweib</italic> [seven-vice woman], simply “Vice,” or <italic>Frau Sünde</italic> [Dame Sin]),<sup>46</sup> she appears regularly in drawings as a sort of “sin goddess” in manuscripts, woodcuts, and broadsides.<sup>47</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Whereas earlier Frau Welt had two opposing dimensions, a beautiful front side and a hideous back part, with the two set in opposition, in her new shape artists depict her as a one-dimensional figure, now facing the viewer. Her anatomy is still bifurcated, however. Now the contrast resides between top and bottom. The top half of her body is that of a beautiful woman, while the lower portion is not human, but avian and serpentine. She thus assumes the shape of a chimera—a half-human, half-zoomorphic figure.<sup>48</sup> This mutant sometimes stands on a globe of the world,<sup>49</sup> and sometimes she wears bat wings.<sup>50</sup> In her hand she often bears a chalice. In the animal region her legs are engaged with themselves in a battle to the death. One leg is a bird’s foot with a huge claw, signaling that the bird is one of prey, and the other is a serpent that is biting the bird’s foot. In drawings the artist labels the avian leg “the life of mankind” (das ist das leben dez menschen) and the serpentine leg “death” (der tot).<sup>51</sup> The struggle between life and death that artists enact upon the very body of Frau Welt is a scheme for teaching.<sup>52</sup> Her physical features are mnemonic, promoting the easy recall of the capital vices, with which she is linked in deathly embrace.<sup>53</sup> The viewer, gazing at this reconfigured tempter, literally composed of the sins, is meant to have a threefold response: repulsion, awareness of the nature of the material world, and the resolution to exchange transience for eternal glory. These aims Michel Beheim shares with illustrators of manuscripts and broadsides. No single source text can fully account for our song-poem, whose most striking feature is the crown of sin. The closest analogues are in the graphic arts, leaving us to reason that Beheim’s creative imagination was fired by artistic representations of the allegory.<sup>54</sup> If this is correct, his chief contribution to the long history of Frau Welt in German lands is to shape a hybrid <italic>figura mundi</italic> in song, one retaining aspects of Frau Welt (beautiful exterior, repulsive interior), while augmenting the literary tradition by adapting the convention of the body of Frau Welt as the locus of the deadly sins, as seen in the pictorial arts.</p>

         <title>Ain exempel von der welt</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> (A moral lesson concerning the world) (no. 448) is Beheim’s second dark meditation on the world, in which Frau Welt emblematizes the dangers of attachment to this life.<sup>55</sup> It has elicited, to my knowledge, no scholarly comment, perhaps because a very different aspect of Frau Welt appears here. Since <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> complements <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>, it seems that Beheim wished the two to be seen as representing different perspectives, but still as forming a balanced whole. The opening setting is the same, but then the versions divide, each revealing a different dimension of the allegory of Frau Welt.</p>
         <p>Both are cautionary works, constructed as parables, the terms <italic>beispel</italic> and <italic>exempel</italic> in the titles intersecting under the influence of the Latin <italic>exemplum</italic>. The structure of each is trifold, corresponding to three voices that make the poetic statement: the lover of the world, the exegete, and the warning prophet. Both song-poems, told under the similitude of a personal amorous encounter with a lovely lady in a natural setting, use that chance meeting to frame an expression of <italic>contemptus mundi</italic>. Each opens in a charming place, here a field, which is very familiar to secular love lyrics; and each narrator speaks in the first person, relating his experiences as a libidinous fool. In nature, the would-be love-servant meets a beautiful woman and pledges his fealty to her. The leitmotif is illusion. The world dazzles the beholder (the poetic “I”), who, with profound shock, realizes that the temporal sphere is a figure for vanity. The closing in both versions is an explicit warning to the reader or listener about the spiritual price to be paid for excessive devotion to the temporal sphere.</p>
         <p>In outline these two didactic song-poems on Frau Welt are identical in motif and ideology. In the short space of four score verses, each employs dark language, later decoded by the erstwhile servant, now speaking in the voice of the exegete. This voice expresses profound scorn for the material world—the figuration of which is a golden-haired woman wearing ornamental headgear. Both times Beheim closes with admonitions, in the voice of the warning prophet. <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> concludes:</p>

         <p>Despite all the similarities, the two versions of the allegory differ markedly. First, there is the appearance of Frau Welt herself. Whereas the woman in <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic> is a creature with two physical dimensions, a beautiful front and an ulcerous back, the creature in <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> exposes but one side, a front-angle view of allurement and majesty. She is the fullest representation of courtliness, refined in manners and dressed in luxurious clothing studded with gems. Second, Frau Welt, in this rendering of the allegory, participates in the Apocalypse. Christ and his disciples, depicted as <italic>ain kung mit zwalff ritern</italic> (a king with twelve knights) (line 62) arrive on the scene to bring the reign of Frau Welt, here a queen, to a shameful end. Beheim’s exegetical voice decodes the allegory:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <verse-group>
               <verse-line>Die kungin zel ich gen der welt. Ir tarn</verse-line>

            </verse-group>
            <p>[The queen I deem to be the world. Her deception and arrogance will soon be destroyed when the king and his knights arrive on Judgment Day.]</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Beheim does not reveal why he abandons the image of sepsis that marks his other depiction of Frau Welt. One explanation is that he wishes to explore aspects of the allegory found chiefly in the pictorial arts. In addition, he invites his audience to puzzle out the inspiration for the configuration of Frau Welt in <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic>. The impetus comes, we conclude, from two passages in the New Testament that permitted him to situate Frau Welt in a strongly eschatological framework. These are the temptation of Christ (Matt. 4:1–11) and the woman arrayed in purple and scarlet (Revelation 17–18). The latter is especially relevant. Although Beheim devotes almost half of this song-poem to a description of Frau Welt, the verses mention her beauty only in passing and with the regnant clichés of courtly love poetry: radiant face, chalk-white skin, ruby mouth, eyes like a falcon, and so on. Depicting costly and spectacular raiment befitting a sovereign, the poet focuses on her finery, not her seductive beauty. She is clothed in elegant purple and covered with ruddy gold and jewels and pearls. He limns every magnificent detail, from her crown of red gold and coiffed blond hair to her ornamented belt and splendid shoes. Three times Beheim mentions the precious stones with which her person is adorned (lines 20, 28, 41). Her masterfully cut clothing is the height of fashion; the multifold colors suit a queen; and the fabrics and accoutrements are the finest that the world has to offer. These combine to produce a <italic>wunniglichen schein</italic> (delightful appearance) (line 29).</p>
         <p>But pulchritude and elegance are not the only aspects of Frau Welt in <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic>. She also relies on gentility and flagrant bribery to win over her intended servant. Her gracious speech and courtly manners influence him and she combines these with a winning directness of manner. In contrast to <italic>Ain beispel von ainem weib</italic>, where the dumbstruck man took the leading action, expressing the wish to become her servant, in <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic>, Frau Welt openly invites him to become her attendant: “Wiltu mein diener wesen?” (Are you willing to become my servant?) (line 51). To obtain compliance, she offers a double bribe: the servant will both receive wealth and keep company with emperors and kings (lines 52–53).</p>
         <p>In so structuring the conditions of servitude, Beheim shifts the focus from the erotic appeal of Frau Welt to her wealth, power, and control over temporal affairs. She reveals herself to be more autocrat than siren. What convinces her admirer to enter her service is ultimately neither beauty nor fair speech but the secular paramountcy of Frau Welt, who celebrates her authority with the assertion: “ich pin ain kungin aller erd” (I am queen of all the earth) (line 55). She further asserts that no one can defeat her militarily (line 56).</p>
         <p>The cupidinous lover, unable to resist her magnificent appearance, the promised riches, and her pledge that he can arrange for him to consort with royalty, serves her assiduously. He identifies himself specifically as her “vassal” (ir dienest man) (line 58). When Christ and his disciples arrive, he suddenly learns the consequence of the embrace of the earth, turns, by implication of the final verses, to “the rightful king” (dem rechten kung) (line 87). Frau Welt, recognizing in the king and his paladins Jesus Christ and his disciples, gives the call to arms but surrenders without a fight. In fear of the Last Judgment, Frau Welt abdicates her throne, as her servants flee and her realm vanishes from sight.<sup>56</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The theme of the “world” is, we note, one of the most prominent in Scripture.<sup>57</sup> As I have already suggested, Beheim seeks out two passages for his account of Frau Welt: the temptation of Christ and the woman clothed in purple and scarlet. In the temptation scene the Devil offers Christ the power, wealth, and splendor of the kingdoms of the world. In exchange for these, the Savior must worship Satan. Christ refuses the honors of the world and declares that one should serve God only. Beheim establishes a verbal connection to this biblical episode. Frau Welt entices her admirer to enter her service by echoing Satan’s words:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The devil…sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>

         </disp-quote>
         <p>The admirer of Frau Welt conforms to her will. Two paradigms of behavior are present in <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> : to imitate the Savior, or to follow Frau Welt. To follow Christ is to reject wealth, political power, and influential personal associations. To imitate Christ is to serve God only. To accept Frau Welt as a guide—as the foolish servant does here—is to risk one’s immortal soul. By calling the Gospel as witness to stigmatize her as the archtempter in female form, Beheim significantly ups the ante on her wickedness.<sup>59</sup> The explanation seems twofold. First, he is attempting to revive a strain of <italic>contemptus mundi</italic> theology that is ascetic in the extreme. His song-poems on Frau Welt offer no hint of appreciation for the world: it is only a sinful place. Second, and related, Beheim engages in harsh antifeminine polemics. These verses rehearse the belief that the secular realm has a female shape and is best symbolized by a satanic harlot. Beheim arrogates to himself the lofty post of mediator of divine truth.<sup>60</sup>
         </p>
         <p>That the poet draws material from the book of Revelation, or Apocalypse, is hardly surprising, given the frightening vision of the End of Days that <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic> conveys.<sup>61</sup> It is composed in Beheim’s <italic>Lange Weise</italic>, a tonal structure housing decidedly religious subject matter.<sup>62</sup> The immediate environment of our song-poem (no. 448) is eschatological: St. Patrick’s Purgatory (no. 449); the Last Judgment (no. 450); the Last Judgment and the Pangs of Hell (no. 451); and the Joys of Heaven (no. 452).<sup>63</sup> He refers to the Antichrist in a song-poem concerning the evils of the world (no. 445, 193). In another tonal structure, the <italic>Slegweise</italic>, Beheim composed verses on the Signs of Christ’s coming (no. 422), and the Fifteen Signs of Doomsday (no. 423).<sup>64</sup> The Apocalypse occupies much of Beheim’s thought and work.</p>
         <p>In <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic>, Frau Welt is one of the signs of Doomsday. Beheim advances the view that Frau Welt represents a steadily declining world that will reach its endpoint in arrogant corruption, so she becomes an actor in events leading to the Second Coming of Christ. Christ himself defeats her. Beheim’s inspiration here was Revelation.<sup>65</sup> The relevant passage describes a woman with a close similarity to Beheim’s queen. Both are allegorical figures and wear the color purple, traditionally associated with royalty.<sup>66</sup> Both are corrupters and seducers whose dominion over temporal affairs is achieved through the allurement of their persons and their influence over male rulers. They combine great beauty with political power, are self-glorying, and live in opulence—until the Last Judgment, which brings about their fall. The woman described in Revelation 17:6 is, of course, the whore of Babylon, a lascivious, godless woman, “drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus” (ebriam de sanguine sanctorum et de sanguine martyrum Iesu).</p>
         <p>So Beheim augments the previous treatments of Frau Welt by adding a dimension simultaneously eschatological and misogynistic. Beheim was certainly familiar with the role of Babylon in the eschaton. Babylon is the place, according to Beheim, where the Antichrist, son of Satan, was born (no. 355, 125–26). He makes direct reference to the extravagant finery of the whore of Babylon, when explicating the branches of the deadly sin of pride (no. 166, 131–33).<sup>67</sup> Revelation 17:4 describes her so: “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls” (Et mulier erat circumdata purpura et coccino et inaurata auro et lapide pretioso et margaritas). To imitate such clothing and accouterments, for Beheim is contrary to divine injunction (no. 166, 134–40).</p>
         <p>As we have noted, the consanguinity of Frau Welt and the whore of Babylon was promoted chiefly by medieval visual artists. Above we alluded to Heinrich Aurhaym’s illustration of Frau Welt for Hugo von Montfort’s song-poem on her, where, as in Beheim’s song-poem where Frau Welt wears “ruddy gold,” she wears a violet-colored dress and a red belt.<sup>68</sup> In art, in addition to drapery, it is the drinking cup of the whore of Babylon that most frequently unites her with Frau Welt. For example, a (lost) fifteenth-century wall painting in the Chapel of the Guild of the Holy Cross in Stratford-upon-Avon so blurs the identities of the two that scholars cannot decide which name is appropriate to the illustration—Frau Welt, or the whore of Babylon.<sup>69</sup> A significant measure of the difficulty in deciding which of the two is depicted in the painting derives from the goblet that the figure carries, which is the chief iconographic attribute of the whore of Babylon. This golden vessel (<italic>poculum aureum</italic>) (Rev. 17:4) contains, according to the Bible, the whore’s abominations and filthiness. Those who identify the painting as Frau Welt recognize that, in the later Middle Ages, she is often depicted holding the drinking cup from Babylon. In fact, a drinking cup appears in so many German illustrations of Frau Welt that it becomes her attribute, borrowed from the whore and transferred to her by artists who not only equate the two allegorical figures but make the cup representative for one of the deadly sins that Frau Welt displays. The specific transgression represented by the goblet in portrayals of Frau Welt may vary, but the association of the cup with her is firm. In Beheim’s century we may cite a manuscript illustration of Frau Welt<sup>70</sup>—given the name “Satan”—holding out a goblet in her right hand. St. Benedict, in the adjoining companion image, counters her gesture with a cross that he extends to ward her off. In the saint’s left hand a Latin banderole proclaims that her drinking cup contains a venomous brew:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <verse-group>
               <verse-line>Vade retro Sathana. Numquam suade</verse-line>
               <verse-line>mihi vana. Sunt mala quae libas ipse</verse-line>
               <verse-line>venena bibas.<sup>71</sup>
               </verse-line>

         </disp-quote>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>[Step back, Satan! Never recommend to me what is vain. Evil is what thou offerest, drink the poison thyself!]</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>On a Zurich woodcut, the drinking vessel symbolizes gluttony (<italic>frashait</italic>).<sup>72</sup> Revealing for our study, the Latin inscription under the same illustration explicitly identifies it as <italic>calicem Babilonis</italic> (drinking cup/chalice of Babylon).<sup>73</sup> Frau Welt and the whore of Babylon thus merge. A pictorial representation like that on the woodcut firmly links the deadly sins with the harlot whose “sins have reached unto heaven” (peccata eius usque ad caelum) (Rev. 18:5).</p>
         <p>In the case of Beheim’s song-poem on the Antichrist (who, he claims, was born in Babylon), it is certain that he versified and set to music a xylographic block book that held pictures, as well as text.<sup>74</sup> One should not assume this to be an isolated case. Since fifteenth-century decorative arts encourage the union of Frau Welt and the whore of Babylon, it seems likely that pictures influenced Beheim to see the figures as interchangeable.</p>
         <p>Their crimes, born of sinful pride, include opposition to God, claims to rule the earth, control over other rulers, and active promotion of a devotion to the world that leads to vassalage in her followers. What Lutz says of the whore of Babylon applies equally to Frau Welt. The former is: “Die Große Hure Babylon, die die Könige und Völker dieser Welt, die <italic>amatores mundi</italic>, zum Abfall von Gott bewegt und in ihren Untergang hineinzieht” (The great whore of Babylon, who incites the kings and peoples of this world, the lovers-of- the-world, to renounce God and who brings them to their downfall).<sup>75</sup> Beheim describes that downfall in <italic>Ain exempel von der welt</italic>, sketching a fearful scene of the last days, as Christ and his disciples rid the world of the pernicious and diabolical rule of Frau Welt. At the same time they liberate her servants, the foolish lovers-of-the-world. What makes the song-poem singular is that Frau Welt, dressed in the finery of the whore of Babylon, has a critical role to play on the day of the Last Judgment. Her arrogant contravention of heaven becomes here a part of the divine plan, and her defeat signals the ultimate triumph over evil. She has morphed from an emblem of worldly lust to a harbinger of the Second Coming.</p>
