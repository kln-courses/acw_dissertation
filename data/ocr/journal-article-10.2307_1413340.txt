Historically, the author tells us, mankind has passed from bondage to freedom; from custom and habit to progress and change; from determinism to indeterminism. He then reviews and rebuts nine argu- ments for determinism, and rehearses twelve arguments in favor of free will. So far as the intellect is concerned, free will has the better of it. But feeling and instinct must have their say; and so we turn to pragmatism, where "the wish is father to the thought," and are shown that the choice between determinism and indeterminism 'makes a difference '-to the advantage of libertarianism. Professor Horne is arguing to a foregone conclusion, and his writ- ing, though clear enough, is superficial. It would, indeed, not be difficult to invert his reasoning; to show that mankind has passed historically, from superstition to law, from anthropomorphism to causation; to review and rebut twelve arguments for interminism, and to rehearse nine arguments for determinism, with the result that, so far as the intellect goes, determinism has the upper hand. The appeal to pragmatism is of the nature of an appendix; it is not integral to the main thought of the book; but here, again, Schiller and Thorn- dike would suffice for a reversal-at the author's level-of the con- clusion at which he arrives.</page></plain_text>
