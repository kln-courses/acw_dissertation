<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LIII, No. 10 MAY 10, 1956 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS HOW are life, value, and happiness related to one another when each is conceived of as profoundly as possible? Are all three on a par, or do they fall into a hierarchy of priority and derivation? If the latter, then how and why? Centuries of experience and reflection have, I believe, made it abundantly clear that, as regards life and happiness, happiness is derivative and life is determinant. We are happy if and only if we live in certain ways; it is the total pattern of life which deter- mines the quality, extent, and intensity of happiness. This is true however we conceive of happiness-whether as an aggregate of pleasures outweighing pains, or as the pervasive sense of well-being which accompanies the life of virtue, or as the "peace that passeth all understanding " which reflects man 's spiritual rapport with Deity. The relation of value and happiness to one another is much more controversial. Subjectivists keep insisting that values are the product of evaluation and that evaluation reflects pleasure and a sense of well-being or their opposites. The valuable is here denied independent status; it is defined as the valued; so-called values are regarded as unconscious, more or less reified, extrapolations of our subjective affective states of mind. We do, indeed, tend to ascribe value to whatever we experientially encounter as giving us pleasure or satisfaction. But this ascription, however natural, is not defensible. Nothing is in fact valuable in itself, and values, as such, have no ontological reality of their own. The "valuable" is nothing but the light, or the shadow, of our own affective states which we empathically project upon the "objects " of our awareness. The counter argument is no less familiar; it is the exact reverse of the position just outlined. Values are, in some sense, real in their own right and, in some degree at least, encounterable and knowable. Our evaluations are our attempts, however successful or unsuccessful, to apprehend "objective" values -correctly; valid evaluation is in principle possible. Life, in turn, is good or bad in proportion as it is based on, and reflects, valid evaluation of these objective values. It is man's proper destiny to live well; to live 317</page><page sequence="2">318 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY well is to live wisely; to live wisely is to evaluate truly; to evaluate truly is to discover the values which really are and which are of crucial importance for us. What we crave and need is not just life but life in conformity with value. This is the recurrent theme of all "objective idealists," ancient, medieval, and modern. Plato proclaimed it when he ascribed ulti- mate reality to "Ideas" or "Forms" culminating hierarchically in the "Form of the Good" and when he described the good life as man's search for, and his progressive "'participation'" in, the "Good "-a participation issuing in happiness. Aristotle con- curred. Virtue depends on the knowledge of, and conformity to, the ultimate teleological rationality of things; happiness is the product of wisdom. All medieval thinkers except the nom- inalists were "realists" in the medieval sense, insisting on the trans- human reality and significance of the " values " of beauty and justice, truth and holiness. All these values had, they believed, ontological roots in ultimate reality or being. Kant, in his own way, expressed the same conviction. The locus of virtue is the good will and the will is good when, and only when, it is obedient to the Moral Law which is the law of the noumenal "world" of value. Happiness, he taught, is contingent on virtue, not auto- matically, but by Divine fiat; God somehow, in the long run, rewards virtue with proportionate happiness. Modern idealists, German, British, and American, have likewise, in their various ways, defended the independent reality of values, the possibility of valid evaluation, and the dependence of happiness on wisdom and virtue. It is hard to see how the quarrel between the "subjectivists" and the "idealists" (to use two convenient omnibus terms) can be resolved. The normative component in human experience can be interpreted in both ways with great plausibility. If we start with either mind-set, all the relevant experiential data permit of interpretation within that framework. Satisfying experience is, indeed, by definition, satisfying; it also involves approval of the "object" which is satisfactorily encountered. In colloquial lan- guage, it feels good to find things good. This is the ambiguous experiential "Gestalt" which is so differently interpreted. Does "feeling " dictate "finding,'" or do we "feel'" what we really "find"? Is our finding more apparent than real; do we in fact not find at all but merely unconsciously project our feelings em- phatically? Or, reversely, do we "feel good" because we really do find values and in proportion as we really find them; are values in fact somehow independent of us, awaiting our discovery and</page><page sequence="3">LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS 319 eliciting our loyalty ? In short, are values the source, or the product, of our pleasures and our happiness? There is a third way of analysing this "Gestalt," a both/and alternative to this historically stubborn either/or. May not value be an emergent, an ineffable product of the experience of a dynamic self in dynamic relation with a "world" of permanence and change? This view would assign priority neither to happiness nor to objective value but to the process of experience; value is the epiphenomenal product of man's encounter with things and per- sons, the hall-mark of the congeniality of the conscious self and its object. Such congeniality or harmony or rapport registers itself affectively in the feeling of pleasure or happiness and cognitively in the judgment that the object encountered is "good," but what alone is actually "good" is the congeniality or harmony of the self and its "object." This third alternative, which assigns priority to what I have previously referred to as "life," is the position which I should like to explore further. What, in this context, does the term "life" signify? What is its "ontological" meaning? Let me start with a quotation from Tillich. "Ontology," he says, "is the foundation of metaphysics, but not metaphysics itself. Ontology asks the question of being, i.e., of something that is pres- ent to everybody at every moment. It is never 'speculative' in the (unjustified) bad sense of the word, but it is always descriptive, describing the structures which are presupposed in any encounter with reality. . . . Ontology is in this sense analytical. It analyses the encountered reality. . . . Ontological verification involves the appeal to intelligent recognition." 1 Tillich's distinction between ontology and metaphysics raises various problems which I do not want to consider here. I have quoted this passage merely to dis- tinguish (a) the attempt to identify and describe a basic compo- nent of experience from (b) the attempt to interpret this compo- nent in a systematic metaphysical context. My present concern is not to expound a metaphysic; it is merely, or primarily, to identify and describe, as basically as possible, what is vaguely pointed to and designated as "life." What, then, is the ontological essence of living, of being alive? What, in essence, is this process which every metaphysic must, in its own way, account for and try to interpret as adequately as possible? By "life" we mean, first of all, what all "living" things have in common, from the most primitive living organisms to man. 1 Paul Tillich, Love, Power, and Justice, Oxford University Press, 1954, pp. 23-24.</page><page sequence="4">320 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY (The difficulty of drawing a sharp line between the "living" and the "lifeless," the "organic" and the "inorganic," need not trouble us at this point.) "Life," so designated, is, at the very least, a process involving perpetual change. But it is not mere change. It is a "directional" process, a process of unconscious or conscious "striving." Neither "directional" nor "striving," in turn, is a self-explanatory term; both point, as it were, beyond themselves. The term "striving" inevitably raises the questions: What or who is striving? And for what? And against what or from what? Similarly, the term "directional" implies some frame of reference, and, within it, some good or telos for that which is directionally dynamic. Some readers may disagree with me at this point. They may insist on the ultimacy or self-sufficiency of the sheer process of living. But, for my part, I can make no sense of any process con- ceived of in vacuo. All process, including the process we call "life," is existentially known to us only in the context of what we loosely call "individuals" reacting to "objective situations." I find it impossible to envisage even the most primitive form of life save in terms of (a) a "something" (however flexible and dynamic its "individuality"), (b) seeking to maintain itself and to "advance" or "grow" or "develop " in a manner conformable to its own essen- tial being, (c) by suitable adaptation to, and use of, whatever in its total environment it in fact encounters. I know of no scientific description of the "behavior" of primitive organisms which omits reference to these "subjective" and "objective" components; what is always, and necessarily, described is a bi-polar process-the activity of a something in relation to something else. If Occam's razor is used to amputate either or both of these poles the residual activity becomes, I believe, an unidentifiable, indescribable, and therefore meaningless ghost; what is left is not "life" but a pseudo- word with a phantom meaning. In these pages we are not concerned with life in its entire sweep but only with life at the human level. It is interesting to note, however, that our tentative description of "life" as such is applicable, mutatis mutandis, to all spatio-temporal finite process. Inorganic nature reveals itself progressively to modern science as dynamic process or as an infinitely complex web of processes each of which, insofar as it is in some degree identifiable and describable, is the activity of a "something" which, metaphorically, strives to maintain itself and realize itself in its dynamic environment. How else can we conceive of atomic and molecular activity, or the com- plex behavior of heavenly bodies, or the behavior of gross per-</page><page sequence="5">LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS 321 ceptual bodies? In this wider context, "life" might therefore be described as the biological expression of a universal finite dynamism. Be this as it may, human life can certainly be described as "life" as it transpires at the level, or in the form, of human living. What then, in essence, does human life involve? Using Occam's razor as ruthlessly but as judiciously as I can, I am unable to describe human life in more elementary terms than these: that it is the everlastingly unique yet universal striving of human individuals, as persons, to realize themselves by suitable adaptation to their very complex environment. This simple state- ment bristles with ambiguous terms which call for clarification. By an "individual" I mean a finite locus or center of relative permanence, that is, a subjective core of identity as enduring as the continuing process which it sustains. An "individual" some- how persists in the very process of submitting to, and initiating, change. It is one and the same individual that undergoes change, passively, and that, as active agent, induces change in itself and its environment. By "environment" I mean the sum total of dynamic processes which are, in some ultimate sense, independent of the self but which impinge upon it with a coercive and orderly character of their own. By "self-realization" I mean the dynamic drive of each individual agent consciously or unconsciously to ac- tualize his potentialities in manifest character and behavior. By "suitable adaptation" I mean that total "response" of the indi- vidual, both passive and active, receptive and creative, to his total environment which betokens not only his dynamic relationship to it but, in addition, that specific type of relationship which will, in fact, enable him to realize his unique potentialities. What I am envisaging, in short, is that total complex dynamic process which we call human life or human living-a process in which all men participate so long as they are alive and in which, the more suc- cessfully they live, the richer and more abundant their lives become. This summary account of human life enables us to distinguish between life as such, without further qualification, and what I shall call a " good " life. Let us entitle mere life " existence. " Existence is that elementary psycho-physical process which (ignor- ing immortality) ceases at death. Mere existence can then be contrasted with a progressively "good" life as follows. (a) Man is able to exist at an incredibly low level of satisfaction and in a state of great cultural and spiritual poverty. Millions of our fellowmen live at a level of bare subsistence-hungry, insecure, fearful, hopeless, apathetic, numb. Yet few commit suicide; men</page><page sequence="6">322 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY stubbornly cling to life even at its miserable worst. (b) Existence becomes sensuously satisfying and physically healthy in proportion as men understand and successfully adapt themselves to their physical environment and in proportion as they learn to adapt this environment to their own physical needs. These are the minimal gross conditions of a satisfactory "sensate" culture. (e) Existence becomes culturally satisfying and culturally healthy in proportion as men relate themselves realistically to one another as cultured beings, that is, as assimilators, carriers, and creators of culture. By "culture" is here meant the sum total of all that men have, through the generations, created and discovered and moulded into a complex amalgam of attitude and behavior, artifact and belief, character and institution. (d) Existence becomes spiritually meaningful and rewarding in proportion as man's high- est spiritual potentialities are actualized in moral association with his fellows and in dynamic relation to whatever transhuman spirituality may in fact make itself dynamically available to him in his perennial spiritual or religious quest. I use the word "high- est" to signify the tendency of all who, in some sense, believing themselves to have participated in life at this level, judge it to be superior in quality and value to whatever is encountered and enjoyed at other levels. I agree with Mill that the only person who is qualified to make a comparative judgment betweell two types of experience is the man who has sampled both and has in some measure understood both. I am therefore assuming that the "life of the spirit" is, for those who have savored it, the "pearl of great price" for which, if necessary, the whole world is well lost. Has this analysis helped us to determine the ontological status and priority of life, value, and happiness? It has at least con- firmed our earlier account of happiness as an emergent-as the product of what we have called "suitable adaptation" of the in- dividual to his total environment, physical, cultural, and spiritual. But what about life and value? Does either of these now seem to be more ultimate than the other or are they ontologically on a par ? The only adequate answer to this question is unfortunately somewhat complex. We have thus far used only the generic term "value" (our modern equivalent of Plato's generic "Good") to designate this elusive component. "Value" is normally taken to include the distinguishable values which we call "truth," "beauty," "the morally good," and (in some contexts) the "holy." Let us con- sider the existential meaning of each of these four terms in the light of the foregoing analysis of life at its several possible levels. What does it mean, in as ultimate terms as possible, to live truthfully,</page><page sequence="7">LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS 323 harmoniously and creatively, morally, and reverently ? How do these apparently distinguishable ways of living "well" differ from one another? To live truthfully means, subjectively, to develop our own inner potentialities as fully and harmoniously as possible, and, objec- tively, to relate ourselves as realistically and benficially as possible to our total environment. These two aspects of truthful living go hand in hand; we achieve richness and integrity as persons as we learn to respond appropriately, as receptive and dynamic agents, to all the many impacts which our complex environment makes on us. In very simple language, living truthfully means being an integrated growing person in close dynamic relation with nature, with the riches of human culture, with our fellowmen as persons, and with Ultimate Reality conceived of as spiritual. To think and know truthfully, in turn, is to be adequately aware of ourselves, as complex dynamic agents, and of nature, mankind, human culture, and God. Insofar as such true knowl- edge is expressed in propositions, truth is the distinctive quality of true propositions. When we assert propositions in judgments, our judgments can be sincere or insincere; they can also be true or false depending upon whether the propositions asserted are true or false. Lying is the insincere assertion of what is believed to be false, or the denial of what is believed to be true, with the intent to deceive. We lie to ourselves when we refuse to face what we really know; such self-deception will finally destroy us. When we deceive, or lie to, others we destroy our end of the only bridge over which we can establish and cultivate personal contact with our fellowmen. Such behavior will, in turn, discourage the efforts of others to attempt to establish rapport with us and to deal faithfully, that is, truthfully, with us. By the same token, if we close our eyes and minds to nature we lose touch with her and never come to know her; if we close our minds and hearts to God He remains unknown to us. All untruthful living and thinking in short, whether uncon- scious or conscious, "instinctive'" or reflective, tends to seal us away from the environment in which alone we can really live and be somebody; it leads to serious "external" maladjustment and "in- ternal" frustration and disharmony. All truthful living and thinking has the reverse effect. Truthfulness, in this embracing sense, is thus seen to condition our very existence and, above the level of bare subsistence, the sensuous, cultural, moral, and spiritual content and quality of our lives. Adverbial beauty and moral goodness are both, in common usage, narrower in scope than adverbial truth. "Beauty" is usu-</page><page sequence="8">324 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ally restricted to certain aspects of nature and types of human artifacts; virtue is similarly restricted to our moral dealings with our fellowmen. Both restrictions are arbitrary and unjustified. The essence of objective beauty is harmonious form. The es- sence of artistic creation is the spontaneous bringing into being of harmonious form which eloquently expresses the artists' best, i.e., his most truthful, interpretative apprehension of his "subject mat- ter." The essence of aesthetic response is sensitive awareness of, and delight in, natural and man-made beauty. The essence of artistic response is sensitive comprehension of art as significantly expressive. When these creative and recreative processes are thus defined it becomes clear that there is nothing in the finite world to which man cannot respond aesthetically, either re-creatively or creatively; nothing which he can create in science or technology, abstractly or concretely, which cannot also be aesthetically satisfy- ing (witness an "elegant" mathematical proof, or an "elegant" scientific formula or demonstration, or a fine piece of scientific apparatus, or a well-designed suspension bridge); nothing which a true artist creates with integrity and insight which will not possess formal aesthetic quality (beauty) and expressive significance (artistic content). We need not lapse into sentimentality when we also speak of a beautiful run in football, or a beautiful opera- tion, or a beautiful friendship, or a beautiful personality, or a beautiful religious service, or even the beauty of holiness. No Deity is worthy of our worship who does violence to so essential a component of our nature and who precludes our delight in our awesome contemplation of Him. Where, then, in vital human living, need beauty be excluded? As regards the "good," it is surely significant that we persist in using the same term "good" to designate man's proper moral attitude and behavior to his fellows and, in addition, whatever in his dealings with himself and his total environment is judged to contribute to his well-being. Within the narrower *context (of human relations) we designate as "morally good" whatever truly promotes human well-being, and the richer and more lasting this well-being, the better we judge this "good" to be. Our human dealings with one another are therefore more or less "good"; we are more or less "good" as we relate ourselves to ourselves and to others more or less worthily or truthfully; our human society is "good" in proportion as the persons who compose it are them- selves "good" and behave as they should. Indeed, it is possible, at least in principle, to judge aspects of a culture, or even an entire culture, to be more or less "good" or "bad" by the same criterion of authentic human welfare.</page><page sequence="9">LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS 325 We must of course grant that all our interpretations not only of human nature and moral obligation but of nature itself are "culturally" conditioned. Our moral insights and standards re- flect a moulding process to which we have been subjected since infancy; so do our apprehensions of, and dealings with, the world of organic and inorganic nature. What each of us sees in nature and what your conscience and mine dictate as moral obligation to our fellowmen is always our individual variant of our culture's perspectives and attitudes. It is human nature and nature thus individually and culturally apprehended which we judge to be harmful or beneficial, good or bad, kindly or cruel, beautiful or ugly. Yet we are also able in some measure to conceive of the inevitable limitations (i.e., the partial untruthfulness) of all hu- man cultures, even our own; we can at least conceive of a possible transcultural apprehension and assessment of nature and human nature which would do far greater justice (i.e., be more truthfully related) to both. Were such an understanding within our reach, it would in fact put us into much more authentic rapport with nature itself and with our fellowmen and thereby promote our own greater welfare and that of others. The same can be said of our apprehension of, and response to, God. God is, for men in any given culture, what the members of that culture have encountered Him as and interpreted Him to be; the religious beliefs and practices of any member of that cul- ture are necessarily his individual variants of his religious heritage. Man's religious quest, in short, is as individually and culturally conditioned as are all his other human ventures, political and eco- nomic, familial and judicial, aesthetic and scientific. But we can at least speak of God's nature as it is in itself and realize that all finite apprehension of God, in whatever religious tradition, is surely inadequate. By the same token, we can and should admit that, even in moments of great spiritual ectasy, our own vision of God is partial and warped and that our best attempts to serve Him are bound to fall far short of what He ideally requires of us. When, therefore, we call God "good," as we do, we know, or ought to know, that we are ascribing to Him a " goodness" which we ourselves only very partially understand. Yet our rapport with Him, however inadequate, can suffice to show us how pro- foundly our " good," so far as we understand it, depends on Him; it can also impel us to conceive of His goodness as far transcend- ing all that we can ask or think. When the "values" of truth, beauty, and goodness are explored in this existential way they seem to imply one another so consider- ably as almost, if not quite, to blend into one another. All human</page><page sequence="10">326 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY experience, in proportion as it is healthy and vital, seems to relate man to his fellowmen, to nature, and to God truthfully, harmoni- ously, and beneficially. All human striving seems to aim at self- realization through whole-hearted rapport with objective reality. Life cannot be good if it is basically out of step with the real-if it rests on errors and lies, or if it is gross or insensitive or arrogant. The beauty of life and of all men's creative products and insights is conditioned by their truthfulness and by their contribution to man's total well-being. Truth is good not only in itself but be- cause it conditions beauty and promotes human welfare. I am not prepared to argue that the three terms "truth," "beauty," and " goodness " are synonymous, but I would urge that they designate three very closely related aspects of what we can generically entitle the "valuable" in life or the "value" of life. Have we now answered our question as to the ontological prior- ity of life and value? If our summary analysis is at all correct we can say, I believe, that life as such, that is, as bare existence, is not valuable save as the precondition of all valuable living. It is indeed good potentially, but, for a multitude of our miserable fellow mortals, it is barely good enough to be endurable. Com- paratively speaking, at least, life is for them pathetically out of tune with nature and with the enriching values of human culture; it is tragically inhuman and inhumane; it tends to lack all spiritual depth, strength, and joy. This nearly bare existence is so miserable because it so largely lacks value. But to say it lacks value is to ascribe to "value" some sort of autonomous character and in- dependence. What sort ? This is the crucial problem for all idealists. Their typical answers, as we know, are either to ascribe to values, one or several, the ontological status of independent essences (as in Plato and Kant, in their different ways), or else to conceive of values as essential aspects or dimensions of reality itself Which await man's discovery and which actually become valuable for him only in pro- portion as he relates himself to them adequately. A third alterna- tive, which all "objective idealists" reject, is to conceive of values as mere ideals which mankind has itself created by abstracting and idealizing the most satisfying aspects of its past and present experiences. This solution satisfies most humanists but it seems to all sincere idealists to cut, or at least seriously to impair, the nerve of man 's normative endeavors. Glorious indeed is man's creativity at its imaginative best, but correspondingly awful are his most perverse ideals. If all our values are nothing but man- generated ideals, and if there are no normative standards by ref- erence to which we can judge human ideals, how can we reasonably</page><page sequence="11">LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS 327 condemn any actual ideals, however cruel or degrading, or reason- ably prize any ideals which seem to us admirable? Does not the denial of objective values, in short, reduce all purposive human effort to chaos and futility? Must we not, then, however precari- ously, postulate some normative standards which are not man-made but man-discoverable, standards by reference to which he can judge good and evil, true and false, beauty and ugliness, with some measure of reasonable assurance? If so, must we not say that value is, in some sense, ontologically independent of life and the condition of the good life, and that life which has value is valuable because it conforms to, or participates in, or exemplifies value? There remains one alternative, however, which will impel those who are able to accept it to answer our question in exactly the reverse way. I mentioned earlier, but did not further explore, the possibility of conceiving of finite inorganic nature in a manner analogous to our tentative conception of biological and human life, namely, as a dynamic process of striving through adjustment. I suggested that we might, at least metaphorically, conceive of all physical reality in such basic dynamic terms that "life," bio- logical and human, could be conceived of as higher levels of this self-same universal cosmic activity. This is akin to Bergson's con- ception of a universal e'lan vital and is reminiscent of all forms of dynamic, monistic, evolutionary pantheism. Let us now risk a responsible but initially hazardous metaphysical speculation. Let us extrapolate from all finite striving-inorganic, biological, and human-in the direction of the Infinite (as Bergson does in his own way); and let us rely on man's profoundest spiritual insights to guide us in our exploration of what we will now venture to call the Divine Life. How might "life " be described from this perspective ? If man's most illuminating spiritual experiences are not used as reliable clues to the nature of the Infinite we must, of necessity, define "God" in characteristically abstract metaphysical terms- as Being-in-Itself or Ultimate Reality, as dynamic and creative in some transfinite sense, and as coercing or "persuading" finite real- ity towards greater conformity with His, or Its, eternal nature. The relation of an Infinite Being, so defined, to all value would still be ambiguous. We would be free to follow Plato in the Republic and conceive of the "Good" as itself dynamic (in which case God and the Good would be one); or we could accept Plato's lead in the Timaeus and conceive of the Good as primordial but static, and of God as an independent cosmic dynamic principle (the demi- urge) who seeks to persuade primordial matter to conform to the</page><page sequence="12">328 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Good in some degree (in which case God would be good because He conforms to Goodness) ; or we could echo Aristotle in conceiving of God as the rational telos of all finite reality which, by its very nature, strives to actualize Divine Rationality at this or that level of finite existence. These are, of course, only three of many pos- sible metaphysical extrapolations to the "God of the philosophers." What is significant for us is that (a) all such ventures are, of necessity, highly speculative; (b) some ascribe the final locus or source of value to the Deity and some do not; and (e) no such purely metaphysical principle, even if it is judged to be the source of value, or to be good because it conforms to an independent Good, and even if it is called "God" or the "Divine," can elicit man's reverence or impel him to religious worship. Any Being who is merely the God of the metaphysicians, however useful He may be as an ultimate principle of explanation and however ad- mirable His metaphysical attributes, must lack the spiritual quality which we have called holiness, the spiritual stature which alone can elicit our enlightened reverence. Hence the crucial importance, for all who are honestly able to do so, of drawing deeply on man's rich religious heritage not only for assurance that God is but for our best apprehension of His nature. Ignoring, for lack of time, all other religious testimony, East and West, and concentrating exclusively upon our own Hebraic-Christian heritage, what does this heritage, duly purged and refined, tell us about God? It tells us that He is in essence dynamic and active-a Power who creates and sustains, judges and loves, forgives and redeems. He is in essence righteous-con- stant, orderly, and just in all His dealings with His creatures. He is, in essence, a God of love or agape. This God is not an impersonal Logos to be imitated, or an aristocratic friend and patron of the cultural elite, or a chilly Moral Law commanding absolute obedience of all rational beings. His very essence is warm, out-going, self-sacrificial love, a love most luminously exemplified on the Cross. This love embraces all creatures, however sinful; it is redemptive of all sin; it is a love powerful enough to transform the world and conquer death itself. This God of power, righteousness, and love did not create the world and then cast it loose; He is whatever in it is affirmative, creative, and redemptive. He is the very principle of all direc- tional striving, of all biological evolution, of all authentic cultural and spiritual growth. He is the substance and criterion of truth, the ground and essence of all finite goodness, the principle of har- mony and the ultimate source and inspiration of all authentic beauty. Yet, in His relation to all finitude, He is also eternally</page><page sequence="13">LIFE, VALUE, HAPPINESS 329 Other; He is holy as nothing finite is ever holy. It is by virtue of His holiness that His truth and beauty and goodness infinitely transcend, without negating, our most authentic apprehensions of, and approximations to, these values. His truth does indeed elicit our cognitive loyalty and search; His beauty does delight us and stimulate our own creative efforts; His goodness does lure us and obligate us absolutely; His love does evoke our gratitude and give us hope and assurance. But it is His holy Otherness, His unique authentic Godliness which elicits our reverence and pros- trates us before Him in contrite reverence. It is this holiness which most essentially distinguishes the God of religion from the God of all secular metaphysicians, that is, of all philosophers who ignore the unique religious dimension of human experience and who have never experienced or understood religious awe. It is this same holiness which preeminently distinguishes the God of religion from all finite creation and signalizes His radical transcendence. Hence the Christian necessity of conceiving of the Incarnation as an absolutely unique event-the sole occasion on which transcendent Holiness itself "became flesh" instead of merely revealing Itself to man in moments of inspiration. Hence too the universal testimony of mysticism, East and West, that God, in all His holiness, can be encountered but never comprehended, intuited but never fathomed by mortal man. The God to whom the believer turns for present redemption and ultimate salvation is God in the totality of His ascribed at- tributes-as ultimate truth, beauty, and righteousness, as sacrificial love, and simultaneously, as holiness. God is asserted to be all these things in perfect unity. We can also say, though only with inevitable ambiguity, that, as ultimate Truth, Beauty, and Right- eousness, He manifests Himself to man immanently as constituting whatever is most affirmative and creative in human culture; that, as Holy, He is utterly transcendent and therefore available to man only in religious ectasy and mystical communion; but that, for Christian faith, He has revealed His mediating and redemptive love for all His creatures with unique clarity and power on the Cross. I repeat, these distinctions are meaningful but dangerous. Far more significant is the religious conviction that God is one, that apart from Him we die, though we continue to exist, and that in Him we live, even when we suffer death. He is our life because He is life in all its fullness. We tru,ly strive only as our striving is faithful to His creative and sustaining power. We live well only as, and when, His goodness flows through us and redeems us. Our highest beatitude is harmony with Him-our total acceptance of His saving Grace.</page><page sequence="14">330 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY This entire description of God, partly substantival, partly adjectival and adverbial, is, of course, inescapably anthropomorphic and metaphorical. How else can man apprehend anything, in- cluding God, save through human eyes and with the human mind? And how can man attempt to talk about God save metaphorically, in an all too human- language quite unsuited to theology? We can do no more than attribute to God, analogically, the attributes which we somewhat understand, making clear that we conceive these attributes to belong to God as their human counterparts are ap- plicable to mankind at its evolving best. We do and we must attribute these qualities to God because only a God so conceived can satisfy man's highest spiritual insights. This is the Spiritual Power which the man of faith believes himself really to encounter. At least for Christianity, no lesser God could be the God of Jesus Christ crucified and resurrected. I have concluded my essay on this religious note not in order to drag in some extraneous theology but to indicate a way in which "life" can be so conceived as to merit the ascription to it of ulti- mate ontological priority. If Being itself is dynamic, if cosmic dynamism reaches its highest finite manifestation in human life, and if man truly lives only in and through a dynamic Deity whose very essence incorporates all the values we most prize in their onto- logical ultimacy and all the love we need really to live, it follows that Life itself, so conceived, is indeed the source and ground of all value and the final condition of -all happiness.
