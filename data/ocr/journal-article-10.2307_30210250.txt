<plain_text><page sequence="1">To Try That Long Preserved Virginity: Psyche's Bliss and the Teasing Limits of the Grecian Urn WILLIAM F. ZAK S of the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" usually read the poem in one of two ways. For some the Ode affirms, if often in a much restricted sense, the special merits of art set against experiential reality. For others, by virtue of its difficult ironies the poem documents Keats's maturing humanism and growing disillusionment with the exalted claims of the imaginative life. But both groups remain at least implicitly agreed that the Ode dramatizes a conflict involving the poet's divided loyalties to what Walter Jackson Bate calls the self's need "to come to terms with reality," affirmed in the Soul-making speculation of April 1819, and the imagination's conflicting attempt "to bend reality to the heart's desire."1 It is the aim of this essay, however, to argue that there is no profound conflict between the claims of art and life in the poem, nor does it reveal a confessionally minded poet divided against himself. The key to the argument is a submerged sexual metaphor operating throughout the Ode to confirm that its speaker questions and speculates with an artful Shakespearean sophistication and a "knowing," at times nearly impish, humor. The "knowing" humor implies a distance governing his otherwise apparently intense involvement in his own drama; ultimately, it proves he is more the bemused spectator of his own reflective predicament than he is its soul-divided protagonist. But before we discuss the Ode itself, we will need to trace the origins and development of this sexual metaphor in the Mansion of Many Apart- 1.

In their assured humanism we begin to discover the imaginative logic by which the speaker manages to keep his bemused distance from the urn and her enticements. Only in terms of the paradox of sexuality-that violation, pain, and loss can represent a dialectical gain--can we come to comprehend Keats's surprising equanimity, contentedness, and even seeming eagerness in con- fronting human suffering in the Mansion of Many Apartments letter. The development of the thinking principle in man consummates its "delight" with "Maiden-Thought" by ravishing her: "convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness and oppression" (I,281).2 With this dark violation and its aftermath he so obscures her previous "pleasant wonders" that what had seemed a house of pleasure and promise becomes a house of terror: "We see not the ballance of good and evil. We are in a Mist. . . . We feel the 'burden of the Mystery.' " But, strangely enough, Keats is not terrified by the soul's prospect. He has managed, in Yeats's words, to "transfigure all that dread." About the "dark Passages" he calmly states his acceptance of the Wordsworthian faith and challenge: "if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them..,. make discoveries and shed a light in them." If the soul's home has ceased to be Christ's promised "house" of "many mansions" beyond mortal suffering and has become instead Milton's "darksome House of mortal Clay,"3 it remains the place of redemption for Keats. To vary the Evangelist's words, it remains a place prepared for us; it remains our reward. For, in Keats, the thinking principle ravishes to create: "among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the (head) heart and nature of Man" (1,281). If thought darkens and appalls the mind's home with the knowledge of sorrow, that same darkness paradoxically sharpens one's vision; and the sharpened vision of "Genius" represents a new birth of light: he can "shed a light" as Words- worth had in "Tintern Abbey." 2.

Hereafter cited as "Nativity Ode."</page><page sequence="3">84 Keats-Shelley Journal Obviously this new-born light, emerging from within the soul's eye as it confronts darkness, constitutes no ultimate illumination or transcen- dence of suffering. Rather, just as the "intelligences or sparks of the divin- ity" mentioned in the Soul-making letter need a dark "World of Pains and troubles... to school" (n,loz) them and make them souls, so here the vi- sionary light must submit to darkness to recognize and exercise itself in its small way, to give birth to specifically human meaning and consolation. As in Wordworth, the burden of the mystery remains the visionary's eternal burden; but he can ease and lighten it. He can learn himself and teach us how to live with suffering and uncertainty. The illumination that occurs when the visionary makes out the "ballance of good and evil" in one chamber or passage, though it does not enlighten the others, does create an inhabitable home, a secure and comfortable place of rest and renewal, and a stable point of departure for further burdened exploration of the dark passages leading into the miseries of human hearts. Keats could hardly have accepted Maiden-Thought's ravishment with such equanimity and even anticipation had he not seen it as a fertilizing act. His calm submission to the continuing ordeal symbolically reaffirms his faith in the gestational wisdom of Negative Capability; in both specu- lations new "discovery" or "achievement" can only be born without forcing the issue, in the patient acceptance of "uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts" (1,193), of the "burden of the Mystery." As Keats had found from bitter experience, to deny this gestational need was to pervert the creative act and doom it to defeat: to "feel all the effects of a Mental Debauch-lowness of Spirits-the anxiety to go on without the power to do so which does not at all tend to my ultimate Progression" (1,146). Though the Soul-making speculation clearly shares with the Mansion letter the underlying dialectic of gain from loss, it seems to lack the sexual metaphor by which the dialectic is expressed there. The metaphor is not, however, far to seek. Keats's speculation about the soul's "bliss" closely parallels the major tenets of Wordsworth's "spousal verse" sung in the "Prospectus" to The Recluse, a small section of which Keats had quoted in the Mansion letter.4 Moreover, the "Ode to Psyche," which we know to have been composed at or about the time of the Soul-making speculation 4. The "Prospectus" was available to Keats in the "Preface" to the 1814 edition of The Excursion, a poem he proclaimed one of the "three things to rejoice at in this Age" (I, 203).</page><page sequence="4">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 85 and copied along with several other poems directly after it in the long journal letter to his brother of February-May 1819, concludes with a luxuriant marriage metaphor that is intimately related, as we shall see, to the conceptual framework of Soul-making. In the "Prospectus," a text M. H. Abrams identifies in his monumental study of Romanticism, Natural Supernaturalism, as a central instance of the prevalent Romantic metaphor of the apocalyptic marriage, Wordsworth had argued that "Paradise" is not "A history only of departed things / Or a mere fiction of what never was" (lines 5o-51), but the "simple produce" of an ideal, creative union between mind and world, the "discerning intellect of Man /... wedded to this goodly universe / In love and holy passion" (lines 52-54). Only the discerning intellect perceives "How ex- quisitely the individual Mind / . . . to the external World / Is fitted" (lines 63, 65-66) and how exquisitely "The external World is fitted to the Mind" (line 68). Similarly, for Keats paradise is not merely a history "of departed things." An internal paradise, happier far, may be regained. Each man may "possess a bliss peculiar to" his "individual existence" by means of the intercourse of "Intelligence or Mind" and "World" made one and creative through the passions and feelings of the "Heart" (1,0oz). No more than in the "Prospectus" is Keats's conception here based on the lulling siren call of Romantic primitivism, on a "mere fiction of what never was," on Arcadian nostalgia. In the "Ode to Psyche" the initial Arcadian vision seen as the poet "wander'd . . . thoughtlessly" (line 7) is postulated only to be transcended in a more thoughtful, profound vision concluding that poem. Moreover, just prior to the Soul-making speculation Keats had compared primitive culture to "civilized life" and found that the primitive "had mortal pains to bear as bad" as those of civilized man. Primitive or civilized, man is inevitably "subject to the same mischances as the beasts of the forest." Man "may arrive . . . as far as the paralel state in inanimate nature and no further"; the "inhabitants of the world will correspond to itself" (n,iol). With a characteristic mixture of affectionately bemused detachment and ironic bite, just as when a few days earlier he had claimed the "greater part of Men make their way with the same instinctiveness, the same unwandering eye for their purposes .. as the Hawk" (rn,79), Keats here reaffirms in his own more complex idiom Wordsworth's perception of "how exquisitely" even the "individual Mind / . . . to the external</page><page sequence="5">86 Keats-Shelley Journal World / Is fitted." Hence his bemusement at primitivistic nostalgia: "Let the fish philosophise the ice away from the Rivers in winter time and they shall be at continual play in the tepid delight of summer" (II,ol). Miracles can, nevertheless, still occur. In a dialectical reversal our tragi- cally limited world can become a true paradise. If the world itself cannot be transformed, man's imaginative vision can be sharpened by its darkness -the vale of tears become a vale of Soul-making. Purged of naive and instinctive self-regard, man's imagination can be cleansed and focused in "discerning intellect," can see "how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a soul" (II,lo2), in terms of Wordsworth's corollary vision, can see "how exquisitely" the "external World is fitted to the Mind." The thematic progression of the "Ode to Psyche" involves just such a transformation. In the final stanza, after envisioning an inward landscape richly appropriate for a Wordsworthian hymn to the marriage of mind and nature, Keats concludes by celebrating the cleansed imagination. Psyche, purged of the naive, self-regarding curi- osity that nearly ruined her in the old myth, is finally seen as the discerning intellect contentedly wedded to the goodly universe through Love, a reunion suggested, fittingly enough, in a stunning metaphor of languor- ously anticipated sexual embrace. Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the sexual metaphor that con- cludes the Ode is the curious re-introduction of Cupid (Love) into the poem's "plot" after he had so unceremoniously been displaced by a rival- the poet himself enthusiastically and extendedly proclaiming his own de- votion to the goddess, albeit internalized, in the second half of the poem.s Two things are remarkable about this reappearance. Especially significant, in view of the common criticism of the poem's affirmation of imagination as too self-protective an internalization to be harmonized with the human- istic heroism of Soul-making, is Stuart Ende's recent observation that 5. Leon Waldoff, "The Theme ofMutability in the 'Ode to Psyche,' "PMLA, 92 (1977), 416, remarks upon this displacement of Cupid by the poet; but I do not understand how one reconciles the inconsistency between his psychoanalytic interpretation of it as a "rescue fantasy" in which the poet protects himself psychologically from "transience and mutabil- ity," preventing "any further fading of the goddess by making her an inner certainty" with his later conclusions with which I am in essential agreement. Waldoff feels the finale, for example, presents the poet's "open acceptance of the natural process" (p. 418) and that the last stanza represents "not a solution to the problem of mutability, but an adaptation to it... a willingness to accept life, transient..,. though it is" (p. 417).</page><page sequence="6">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 87 despite the seemingly self-enclosed and, thus, defensive subjectivity of the new worship, Cupid's reappearance and the "open casement" imply the mind's trust in its relationship to "othemrness" and its acceptance of its "possible vulnerability ... to a reality seen to be external."6 Secondly, since the initial pastoral setting of the lovers' reunion would hardly conflict with the last stanza's internal landscape and since the sexual embrace of the lovers is common to both settings, one wonders why, when Cupid reap- pears, Keats replaces the initial Arcadian setting evocative of the lovers' heavenly reunion with a darkened bridal chamber lit by a "bright torch," especially since the latter setting would almost certainly remind readers of the original catastrophe involving Psyche's fatal curiosity and a "silver lamp." The account of the myth Keats told in "I Stood Tip-Toe" (lines 141-1So) reveals him completely familiar with the original conclusion to the tale; and, hence, his alteration in the setting for the reunion was a purposeful change, was meant, I believe, in a number of ways to transform the old myth into a high-spirited poetic rendition of the new myth of the Soul he had just schematically formulated in prose. The "late" myth of Psyche, essentially different in spirit from conven- tional Greek conceptions of godhead in allegorically combining, if in a somewhat inorganic psychological way, the notion of divinity with a tragic, purgatorial human experience, would seem tailor-made for a poet bent on defining Soul-making. However, the literal deification of the mortal Psyche, who, after living through suffering, put "off/ Human, to put on Gods" as Milton's Eve had attempted to do, is "too late for antique vows" (line 36) of faith now just as she had been in Roman antiquity. She cannot be worshipped with "any of the ancient fervour" (n,io6) because, without any apparent self-recognition as a result of her trials, she was suddenly and literally freed from mortality and suffering by the inter- position of Cupid and Jove and taken to heaven. That old myth, then, represents what Keats calls in the Soul-making letter the "misguided and superstitious" view of the world as a" 'vale of tears' from which we are to be redeemed by a certain arbitrary interposition of God and taken to Heaven-What a little circumscribe[d] straightened notion!" (n,1o2). Per- haps one can infer from this why the initial Elysian reunion for the lovers 6. Keats and the Sublime (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), p. 130.</page><page sequence="7">88 Keats-Shelley Journal would not ultimately suit Keats; but it is not until one heeds the structural and allusive dependence of the Ode upon Milton's "Nativity Ode" that one realizes why a darkened bridal chamber, the brilliantly transformed equivalent of Milton's "darksome House," should be its inevitable replace- ment. Like Milton's Ode, the "Ode to Psyche" is in its own way an ecstatic annunciation of a new, greater divinity superseding the old. Each poem is a "Hymn" which discovers in its very progress that the essential subject of its prayer is the welcoming of an incarnate god to "this his new abode" ("Nativity Ode," line 18).7 In both poems the worship of the new deity moves from an introductory false hope, the suggestion that perhaps the significance of the god's appearance is a return to a golden age, to the far more awe-inspiring revelation that the god, in becoming flesh, has will- ingly accepted human pain and made even mortality's "bitter cross" (line 152) purposeful. Psyche's "new abode" will not finally be an Elysian garden with Cupid; she, like Milton's Christ, "Forsook" those "Courts of everlasting Day, / And chose with us a darksome House of mortal Clay" (lines 13-14)-there to invite and find Love. This is the distance between the first vision of the "Ode to Psyche" and its second, between what Keats called "hethen mythology" in which "abstractions are personified" and the truer faith in the self's "Redemption" of itself in "Spirit-Creation" (u,10o2-i o3). We ought freely to admit, of course, that the Ode's sensuous finale- And there shall be for thee all soft delight That shadowy thought can win, A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, To let the warm Love in! (lines 64-67) -does not exactly sound a note of rousing challenge to a battle with earthly circumstances. If it did we would not have had so many critics denying or overlooking the poem's essential relatedness to Soul-making because the poem does not dramatize a heroic confrontation with a "World of Pains 7. Kenneth Allott, "The 'Ode to Psyche,'" in John Keats: A Reassessment, ed. Kenneth Muir (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1958), pp. 88-9o, points to echoes of Milton's poem but only to suggest that the tone ofKeats's poem is nearly the opposite of Milton's. I believe the borrowings are more than phrasal echoes and wish to suggest that the tone of the poems is actually quite similar.</page><page sequence="8">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 89 and troubles" (n,1o2).8 But then, when one reflects upon it, neither does the Soul-making speculation itself. If the Soul-making letter affirms the agony and strife in a world of contradiction, it does so only because Keats has attained a vision of the tragically limited and abrasive world as a positive good and, therefore, like Psyche, rests comfortably in it awaiting the Soul's "bliss" (n,lo2). The Ode's finale, while it may appear to settle for a cloistered virtue, implicitly enacts Keats's version of Wordsworth's marital engagement with earthly existence-the "spousal verse" of the great consummation between "discerning intellect" and world; for Psyche's "bright torch" symbolizes at once both the hymeneal torch heralding Wordsworth's "blissful hour," when the poet's Psyche may be joyfully and creatively 8.

A notable exception is the excellent essay of James H. Bunn, "Keats's Ode to Psyche and the Transformation of Mental Landscape," ELH, 37 (1970), 581-594: see especially p. 582, n. 3. Recently, Stuart M. Sperry, Keats the Poet (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), PP. 249-261; Leon Waldoff, "The Theme of Mutability in the 'Ode to Psyche,' " PMLA, 92 (1977), 41o-419; and Homer Brown, "Creations and Destroyings: Keats's Protestant Hymn, the 'Ode to Psyche,' " Diacritics, 6 (1976), 48-56, have each offered convincing refutations of the notion that the view of imagination affirmed in the poem is simplistically escapist or psychologically immature; but these "darker" readings of the Ode must come to terms with the high-spirited playfulness and wit of the introductory lines whose tone and meaning, in a poem whose circular structure ends where it begins, confirm the nature and success of the finale's affirmation. The poem itself is a new birth, bred of the androgynous soul's renewed "possession" of itself anticipated at the conclusion. At a superficial level, of course, the note struck at the outset is apologetic, perhaps for the inadequacy of the poet's song to honor the grandness of his Psyche's conceptions, but certainly because a gallant suitor, especially one who hopes for a renewal of his initial success, does not bandy about the most intimate "secrets" of his mistress's yielding to his "sweet enforcement," even if only with the mistress herself. But the poet's "tuneless numbers" could also suggest the glory of a poetic harmony rivaling the music of the spheres, Keats's half-serious parody of Milton's "unexpressive notes to Heav'n's new-born Heir" ("Nativity Ode," line 116). In such a reading the speaker's invocation to the goddess becomes at once both an exuberantly playful boast and a reverent petition-an announcement to the goddess within ofa victory won, affirming the poetical success of the ending's sexually suggestive passivity and a prayer for its re-enactment-a prayer that is itself a seduction, an attempt through shadowy thought to win again from the Soul-muse for the Soul-muse what only she can yield, to implant what only she can bring to poetic fruition.</page><page sequence="9">90 Keats-Shelley Journal reunited to "Love" not in Elysium but in the body's dark house, and the torch of consciousness that, in calm serenity and receptiveness to ravishing experience, can explore the "dark passages" full of "Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness and oppression" and creatively "shed some light" in the mild interchange of favors between mind and world.9 In both these symbolic dimensions, it ought to be noted, Psyche's "bright torch" functions in telling contrast to the seemingly similar "silver lamp" ("I Stood Tip-Toe," line 147) it recalls from the old myth. There, we remember, Psyche used the lamp to satisfy her curiosity about the identity of her unknown lover; it thus would suggest to Keats the meddling intellect's "irritable reaching after fact and reason" (1,193), something which in the old story Psyche seemingly never recognized as the source of her trials. But this "bright torch" shining through the open casement of the senses in creative recep- tiveness to ravishing experience is not the light that we and the old Psyche, as humans, share with all instinctive life ("the Creature has a purpose and his eyes are bright with it" [u,80]), the light that drives all of us to act our self-regarding parts in a tragic drama. This light, instead, triumphantly subsumes negative capability, the psyche's recognition of the commanding power of consciousness in ease. All the evidences of masculine mental exertion on behalf of the goddess in the final stanza-the "pleasant pain" of the fane builder's "branched thoughts" (line 52), the "wreath'd trellis of a working brain" (line 60), the feigning of the "gardener Fancy" (line 62), and the "delight . . . shadowy thought can win" (lines 64-65)- ultimately serve in obeisance and defer to the feminine receptiveness of the soul faithfully and confidently awaiting Love in the dark amidst its "un- certainties, Mysteries, doubts" (,193). Psyche's torch here is not the lamp that once scared Love off; it is a torch of welcome and guidance inviting Love's return in a manner akin to Milton's "youngest-teemed Star" (line 240) beckoning and leading men to the Incarnate Christ in the "Nativity Ode." It symbolizes the disinterested, god-like vision possible within the 9.

It is this vision of earthly love and receptivity we must keep before us if we are properly to define the limits of the satisfaction the teasing urn offers men. II The similarity of image and effect in the "faery lands forlorn" (line 70) of the "Ode to a Nightingale" and the "desolate" little town of the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" has often been remarked but not, I think, fully elaborated. In both cases, the visionary image depicting a realm bereft of all traces of human life yet closely associated in the speaker's imagination with the putative ideality and mode of existence of nightingale and urn occurs at the conclusion of the penultimate stanza and signals a change in the nar- rator's tone and perspective. The rising excitement, agitation, and appar- ently envious involvement, evident earlier in the poems and resulting from each speaker's fanciful conjectures about the respective symbol's significance and value, give way in the final stanza of each poem to a certain calmness, detachment, and self-possession. In the end the symbol is held, metaphorically, at arm's length as the speaker recognizes and accepts the abyss which divides his human existence from that of the nightingale or the urn-that is, when he accepts himself on earth, alive to both the heights of pleasure and the depths of woe through consciousness and feel- ing, as essentially different from the nightingale and the seemingly more human, but no less unconscious "brede / Of marble men and maidens" (lines 41-42). Like the speaker of the "Ode to a Nightingale," the poet- speaker of the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" had begun his song, at least explicitly, in envious praise of the urn-world and its Arcadian inhabitants, of their exuberant activity and ignorance of process; but in the final stanza his mood is quite different, his song of praise not envious but balanced and neutralized by melancholy: "Cold Pastoral!" (line 45). With those words, we recognize that the speaker in Stanza v, like the speaker of Stanza vn of the "Ode to a Nightingale," is singing a "plaintive anthem" to the urn as his imagination disengages itself from the exploration of an "ideal" world not meant for man, to take up residence with suffering humanity in a "darksome House of mortal Clay," in his native land, the vale of his</page><page sequence="11">92 Keats-Shelley Journal Soul-making. Indeed, the "fancy cannot cheat so well / As she is fam'd to do": whatever glories the speaker's fancy may conjure up for the in- habitants of the urn-world, it cannot fully convince him that their reality is superior to human reality or that he should heed the fancy's seemingly "Kind Syren" call to a more propitious destiny than human life, to a world divorced from pain and loss. In the end the poet-speakerjoyfully envisions human life "all calm," even though he knows old age lays waste to gen- erations. The urn becomes a world apart; its seemingly human figures become simply a lifeless "brede" on a vase. Moreover, here, as in the "Ode to a Nightingale," what exposes the dreaming fancy as a "cheat" is not "reality," but the visionary imagination. The visionary tableau of the silent little town, linked in the poet's imagination with the urn-world as the "faery lands forlorn" had been with the nightingale's, so fills him with a sense of desolation, of "feelinglessness" beyond any human woe, so fills him with the horror of sheer vacancy where no human voice speaks ("not a soul to tell") nor ear hears ("emptied of... folk") that he ceases to dally with the fanciful notion that the urn's supposed ideality holds significance or appeal for humanity beyond its distinctive, clearly limited beauty, which should be praised but surely not envied. In fact, from his newly attained, disinterested superiority of imaginative perspective, the poet- speaker envisions the urn's fate with a mingled sense of bemusement and pity. Those critics who do not see significant irony in the final stanza, who maintain that the speaker endorses the Beauty-Truth equation as relevant to anything beyond the clearly limited, pastoral world pictured on the urn, must ignore the speaker's implicit testimony to the contrary through- out the poem. From the first, the poet-speaker is aware of truths, of reali- ties that are not beautiful, not only with regard to his own human life, but with regard to the urn as well. Only the urn, which proclaims the Beauty- Truth equation, remains ever unaware of them. For the urn, truth is beauty; for the imaginative poet-speaker the two are not equivalent. The Beauty-Truth equation is not some esoteric aesthetic wisdom poet and urn share in defiance of the mortality and logic of man; for the poet-speaker, in exercising his aesthetic faculties, disproves it. Take, for example, the metaphor that begins the poem-"still unravish'd bride ofquietness" (line 1). On the surface, the metaphor suggests that the urn yet remains a "thing</page><page sequence="12">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 93 of beauty," undefiled and pure; but below that surface lie some sad sug- gestions of a reality, a truth, that does not square with the urn's sententious aesthetic claim about the meaning of life on earth. In calling the urn an "unravish'd bride" and "foster-child" (line 2) the poet-speaker metaphor- ically and quite validly defines the urn in terms of generational life and its consequences. The urn is of only a relatively more durable generation than is man. It was "born" in time, a unique material form, generated by its real parents, an artist and an age both long since dead; and because its beauty is so intimately bound up with the earth, with matter, it, too, like its parents, will die in time. "Old age shall this generation waste" (line 46) as well. The urn is no symbol of immortality set over against man's tran- sience.10 It is, without the possibility of annulment, married to quietness; and though, as yet, it remains unravished, yet able to speak pictorially its teasing message to man, it will not remain so forever. Quietness will ravish the urn. Moreover, unlike human brides, the urn's ravishment is peculiarly poignant. Human brides have compensation for their ravishment; the urn, ever unconscious, has none. It will simply age without progeny and then finally cease to exist. This is a truth that is not beautiful, though one must grant that only the poet, not the urn, knows of it. From the poet's point of view in the end, both the urn's glory and its terrible limitation is that it does not know. For when "old age" wastes this generation of "marble men and maidens," abrasively wearing away and obscuring their pastoral history, the all-but-ravished bride, gradually stripped of adornment and virtually unaccommodated in her dishabille, will, for a short while before quietness takes her, lost forever to other men, still "remain" (line 47) to disport her nearly naked "shape" (line 41) before them for their rapt scrutiny but not to satisfy their hunger for "knowledge." In contrast to the concluding symbol of the "Ode to Pysche"-the androgynous poetic Soul generatively "possessing" itself in its marital intercourse with the world, surrendering to all the delights shadowy thought can win-the urn will remain alone to "tease us out of thought" (line 44), slapping the 1o. Most of the discussions of the urn as a symbol of the immortality of art or as a meta- physical symbol of permanence are presumptive, defying or overlooking the metaphorical context of "generation" Keats set in the poem. Hugh I'Anson Fausset, Keats: A Study in Development (London: M. Secker, 1922), pp. 79-80, points out that the seeming permanence of the urn is not one of fact. See also K. M. Hamilton, "Time and the Grecian Urn," Dal- housie Review, 34 (1955), 246-2z54.</page><page sequence="13">94 Keats-Shelley Journal hands of all who would possess or "know" her fully. Ever a coy and mysterious maiden, she will, until taken by quietness, always express to men her youthful credo and teasing "attitude" (line 41) of maidenly protest and adolescent obliviousness to everything but herself. She can proclaim her unchanging defiance of time and her own mortality--of truths that are not beautiful-because she "remain[s], in midst of other woe / Than ours" (lines 47-48). For hers is a "woe" that is not human: aging, dying, yet paradoxically remaining ever youthful; aging and dying but not knowing it. The confined sphere in which the urn and its inhabitants act out their destiny on earth, as the poet's description of their activities reveals, is a maiden's world, neither realizing the "bliss" (line 19) of fulfillment, "Though winning near the goal" (line 18), nor knowing loss, neither expressive of the heights of pleasure nor the depths of human woe. It is an ever-youthful world in which time and loss have no significance for its inhabitants, a prelapsarian realm Keats imaginatively identified with an- cient Greece. The Greek spirit, he told Severn, was "an immortal youth... just as there is no Now and Then for the Holy Ghost."'1 The figures on the urn, like the pastoral characters in Endymion who "unconscious... cull / Time's sweet first-fruits" (I.32o-321), are a last vestige of that age, which knew not "Now and Then," still preserved "not yet dead / But in old marbles ever beautiful" (I.318-319). That is why, in one sense at least, the speaker claims the urn can "express / A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme" (lines 3-4). For, unlike the urn-figures, the poet-speaker has lived through the deflowering, bittersweet experience ofconsciousness, the depths and heights ofjoy and woe. He knows his "rhyme" will reflect that consciousness of time and loss, of truths that are not beautiful. Only the poet-speaker's art, not the urn's, comprehends the fuill range of human experience, the meaning of hearts "high-sorrowful and cloy'd" (line 29) in the satiety of human passion and the "desolate" agony of loss. However half-unhappy and vexed the poet-speaker may be initially with that knowl- edge, at the conclusion he has learned to "live" content with it. "All that dread" has been transfigured. The poem enacts the drama of this change of heart. 11.

He does not conclude by putting art in its place over against the realities of human life; but he creates, out of the imaginative reflections of a temporal artist upon a plastic art, a magnificent poem about art, putting, if you will, an art in its place. The fact that the urn's wisdom does not satisfy does not imply any despair of 12. Nothing in Keats's letters and poetry supports the assumption. Several comments sug- gest that Keats considered such artifacts bibelots, "fancy pieces of Art" (u, 46), on a par with Tassie's gems as Professor Bate hints (John Keats, p. 520o). Take, for example, a passage from Castle Builder: Greek busts and statuary have ever been Held by the finest spirits fitter far Than vase grotesque and Siamesian jar; Therefore 'tis sure a want of Attic taste That I should rather love a Gothic waste Of eyesight on cinque coloured potter's clay Than on the marble fairness of old Greece. (lines 55-61) The important fact to note about the passage is that it occurs in the midst of a comic dis- cussion of the art of interior decoration. Whether the passage reflects Keats's own taste is uncertain; but it is certain that "Greek busts and statuary" or "Siamesian jar[s]" serve to fit out an exotic room of the fancy, ranged beside a lavish display of furnishings including table coverlets and an "ebon sofa... / With down from Leda's cygnet progeny" (lines 65- 66). This is surely not the stuff of great art out of which serious aesthetic theories are made. Similarly, when Keats speaks of his indolent mood in a letter of March 1819, claiming "Neither Poetry, nor Ambition, nor Love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me: they seem rather like three figures on a greek vase" (n, 78-79); his choice of comparison is revealing. For it was of West's inferior Death on a Pale Horse that Keats claimed the lack of "alertness of countenance," of intensity, the criterion of greatness in all art (I, 192). Again, in the "Ode on Indolence" the narrator refers to Grecian urns in similar terms: "the first seen shades return; / And they were strange to me, as may betide / With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore" (lines 8-10). Though cryptic, the judgment is the same as that of the letter of March. The spectral "shades" that pass unheedingly by the poet are "strange," that is, seem- ingly unnatural and unreal, without "alertness of countenance," without intensity for the poet who has been "deep in Phidian lore." As far as we know, Keats's only acquaintance with Phidias was through the Elgin Marbles, which, for his mentors in the fine arts, Haydon and Hazlitt, were the measure of greatness in classic Greek sculpture, ajudgment with which Keats seemingly concurred if the sonnets on the Elgin Marbles are any barometer of his taste.</page><page sequence="15">96 Keats-Shelley Journal imagination or art on the part of the poet-speaker or Keats; for it is only through art and imagination that the speaker discovers the urn's limita- tions. Though seemingly obvious, these are facts not often acknowledged. Since Cleanth Brooks's revolutionary study of the Ode, critics have been more and more willing to allow that the urn's aesthetic equation is a dramatic statement qualified by its poetic context. For many critics this admission simply meant that the Beauty-Truth equation, though clearly not applicable to life, still held some profound, purely aesthetic meaning for Keats.13 Some others, convinced both that the urn symbolizes Keats's more youthful aesthetic credo and that the poem reveals an ironic disparity between the urn's aphorism and the speaker's knowledge of realities, con- clude that the poem dramatizes Keats's despair of art and the imagination.14 Both views, however, overemphasize the aesthetic importance of the symbolic urn. As M. H. Abrams has pointed out, the poet-speaker's "play- fulness and pity, which are no less evident than the envy and admiration, imply a position of superior understanding."15 The speaker's witty, rid- 13. The supposed aesthetic wisdom has, of course, been variously interpreted. Cleanth Brooks, "Keats's Sylvan Historian: History without Footnotes," in The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1947), PP. 150-151, defines it as the history beyond fact: " 'formed experience,' imaginative insight, embodies the basic and fundamental perception of man and nature." Bate,John Keats, p. 517, concludes that the "general premise" of the urn's message"as far as Keats's own personal thinking is concerned, is that the 'greeting of the Spirit' is itself as much a part of nature, or reality, as is its object." See also C. M. Bowra, The Romantic Imagination (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1949), PP. 144-158; Albert Gerard, "Romance and Reality: Continuity and Growth in Keats's View of Art," Keats-Shelley]ournal, 2 (1962), 26-28; Charles I.

Stuart M. Sperry, Keats the Poet, pp. 267-278, in extended commentary on the final apothegm implicitly rejects the notion that the Ode des- pairs of imagination; but he also rejects the idea that the urn's absolute claim in its apothegm represents a faith Keats himself shares. 15.

Even his praise is couched in negative, compensatory phraseology. His injunction to the urn-figure, "yet do not grieve" (line 18), is a whimsical leap of his own imagination. Surely he knows as well as the reader that the lover can only express the "mad pursuit" (line 9) of desire. The poet's art and imaginative vision, then, constitute the core of value in the poem; his is the more inclusive and overwhelming vision, as Keats's speculations about great art in the letters repeatedly confirm. The poet, not the urn, "enjoys light and shade .. lives in gusto, be it foul or fair," relishing the "dark side of things" as much as the "bright one" (I,387). The poet, like Shakespeare, but unlike the urn's aphorism, leaves "nothing to say about nothing or anything" (I,189). If the urn's answer to all his questions is a riddling apothegm, he proves through poetry a more profoundly enig- matic wisdom, though far more unobtrusively. His art is "great and un- obtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject." It is the urn which seems to have a "palpable design upon us-and if we do not agree seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket." We need "not be teazed with grandeur and merit -when we can have them uncontaminated and unobtrusive" (1,224-225). The "Ode on a Grecian Urn" was first published in the Annals of the Fine Arts, a periodical in which most of the poetry to appear concerned itself with the relationship of the visual arts to poetry.16 The Ode clearly begins in those comparative terms: "Sylvan historian, who canst thus express / A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme" (lines 3-4). The urn exists in the world of time, but is not of it. The history it silently tells is of a golden age the poet knows is long dead, but that is paradoxically still alive on the changeless face of the urn. The poet could tell pastoral histories and leg- ends, too, yet not with the immediacy, unselfconsciousness, and spon- taneity of the urn. For the poet not only lives in the world of time; as poet, he must be of it as well. He cannot forget the knowledge that the golden age is gone. Moreover, in his temporal art tales and legends have begin- nings and endings; histories, even Sylvan histories, record the passage of time and action that come to resolution and significance. He cannot hope 16. Ian Jack, Keats and the Mirror of Art, pp. 56-57.</page><page sequence="17">98 Keats-Shelley Journal to capture the sheer exuberance and vitality of motion and activity with- out completion and loss or the illusion of life in time without the passage of time, of an "eternal present," which, he readily admits, the urn as a work of plastic art can do so well. But as the poet's imagination plays upon the scenes of the urn, the urn's very strength as art, a strength that har- monizes so well with its subject, becomes the greatest weakness and limi- tation for him as a temporal artist. The poetic imagination inevitably seeks and conceives significance for and resolution of action."17 He finds, how- ever, that all his questions and imaginative speculations of that sort are finally meaningless and irrelevant to the urn's art. From the poet-speaker's point of view the urn tells a tale that has no ending. The questions the poet in him asks of the urn, with a certain degree of rhetorical whimsy, are questions with which the urn, as a particular specimen of the visual arts, is not concerned and to which he knows it can give no answer. As a Words- worthian poet he is interested in the evidence of things unseen, questions of significance, relationship, and meaning, metaphysical inquiries of whence and whither, as Stanza iv reveals.18 The urn entices and excites the poet's visionary imagination into projecting the urn's sculpturally formed, eter- 17. This point is made incidentally by Helen Vendler in "The Experiential Beginnings of Keats's Odes," Studies in Romanticism, 12 (1973), 6o0. 18. Coincidentally enough, Wordsworth had complained in the 1815 Preface that the Greek imagination was too much in the bondage of "definite form" and that the Greek religion, with its anthropomorphic mythology, was for that reason more "fanciful" than truly imaginative. Hazlitt clearly shared Wordsworth's bias: see "On Ancient and Modem Literature," in The Complete Works of William Hazlitt, ed. P. P. Howe (London:J. M. Dent, 1930-34), vI, 348-353. Moreover, with the exception of the Elgin Marbles, which he ad- mired, Hazlitt felt "Greek statues are little else than specious forms. They are marble to the touch and to the heart .... In their faultless excellence they are raised above the frailties of passion or suffering. By their beauty are they deified. But they are not objects of religious faith to us, and their forms are a reproach to common humanity" ("On Poetry in General," Works, v, 11). That Keats may have encountered Hazlitt's views on this subject in literary discussion and concurred seems possible from his use of the curious phrase "slow time," a phrase Hazlitt also uses in a discussion of Greek art and culture. In "On Antiquity" (Works, xI, 256-260), Hazlitt specifically associated "slow time" with the seeming absence of decay in the fully formed periods of history and art, like the Greek. The younger, but imperfectly formed, Gothic civilization seems, by contrast, much older than the Greek. He concludes: "So it is with respect to ourselves also; it is the sense of change or decay that marks the dif- ference between the real and apparent progress of time" (Works, xu, 256). Though the use of the same highly idiosyncratic phrase in similar contexts by two literary contemporaries who respected one another would seem more than coincidental, no confident claim for Keats's indebtedness can be made since Hazlitt's "On Antiquity" was not published until after Keats's death.</page><page sequence="18">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 99 nal present of activity into another dimension of reality-illusion not really applicable to the urn's art. The urn's answer to all the poet's imaginative inquiries is simply itself--beautiful, formed activity without cause or effect in time or significance beyond the activity itself. Its "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" (line 49). This is the reason the urn "tease[s] us out of thought / As doth eternity" (lines 44-45). It presents the possibility of life and activity in a vacuum, foiling, as eternity does, every attempt at defining its significance and meaning because it suggests activity without comple- tion or resolution, a condition of being utterly unlike human existence. For Keats, however, great art does square with human existence. Shake- speare does not "tease us out of thought," but leads us through a "mo- mentus depth of speculation" to the point at which the "repulsiveness" of unpleasantness in human life is buried (1,192).19 He leaves us content, not vexed or teased. Great imaginative conceptions, the "Epistle to John Hamilton Reynolds" tells us, partake of the "material sublime" (line 69), the "native hue of resolution," in which things are settled to the will's content. They take their "colours from the sunset" (line 68), leaving the reader or viewer "content... in the luxury of twilight" (1,238). The urn, however, cannot begin to bury the repulsiveness of unpleasantness because it never comes to grips with human life, with "desolate" towns and "heart [s] high-sorrowful and cloy'd." It simply is not "true" to the full experience of human life. Moreover, it teases the poet because even the activities it does picture "cannot to the will / Be settled" (lines 76-77). Since the urn's activities have no "native hue of resolution," the poet's imagination can- not rest content. The urn teasingly, suggestively entices the poet-speaker with some implication of significance beneath her beautiful surface adorn- ment, awakening in him the passionate desire to know her fully. But when his imagination responds to the urn's suggestiveness, he finds she is a "deceiving elf." She leaves him up in the air, unsatisfied; for he can dis- cover no valid significance, no knowledge, beneath her appealing surface. His imagination is "brought / Beyond its proper bound, yet still confined" 19. I am aware that several critics, including Douglas Bush, John Keats, p. 140, Cleanth Brooks, The Well Wrought Urn, p. 150, and Earl Wasserman, The Finer Tone: Keats' Major Poems (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1953), P. 52, believe the urn "tease[s] us out of thought" into a superior imaginative intuition of reality. Such readings, however, take no account of the irony in the extended sexual metaphor in the poem, of which "tease" is a part.</page><page sequence="19">100oo Keats-Shelley Journal (lines 78-79), unable to "refer to any standard law / Of either earth or heaven" (lines 81-82) by which to judge the urn's value to men. In the second and third stanzas of the Ode, the speaker's imagination focuses on one aspect of the urn's beautiful adornment, animated pleasure- seeking. Hungry for the meaning beneath this surface, his fancy begins to conjure up the "marble men and maidens" into another dimension of reality-illusion, projecting a range of human emotion, degrees of grief and happiness, upon figures expressive merely of desire and maidenly fear, projecting upon them an awareness of time alien to the reality-illusion of the urn. At first the visionary attribution is relatively balanced and whim- sical as the speaker consoles the "bold Lover" (line 17), suggesting he not "grieve" that he can never fulfill his desire because, by the same token, he can never lose his love. But in the third stanza, presumably overcome by his own unhappy awareness of the human reality of love and loss, he is more emphatic in his stress on the enviable aspects of the urn-figures' imagined condition and very nearly gets carried away by his own fancy, conceiving that the urn-life is not only different in ways from human life on earth but superior to it. In the last three lines of the stanza, however, the speaker is startled out of this cheating fancy; for at the beginning of the fourth stanza the subject has shifted. The speaker withdraws to consider once again the urn's inhab- itants as figures on a Greek vase. What occurs at the end of Stanza mIn is more than just a shift in tone, an "unexpected attention to merely human passions" as Earl Wasserman claimed.20 If it were only that, there would be no reason for withdrawal and all the more reason to expect the fourth stanza to be an impassioned plea for liberation from the mortal lot, a plea such as Endymion would have voiced, to burst our mortal bars and join the superior reality of the urn-figures. Moreover, in terms of "merely human passion" the last lines of Stanza m are not startling or "unexpected"; they simply make explicit what had been subterranean and implicit in the speaker's consciousness throughout the stanza. Obviously, the only reason the urn-figures' love is a "More happy love" (line 25) is that it is unlike merely human passion and is, instead, "For ever warm and still to be 20. Earl Wasserman, The Finer Tone, p. 41. Morris Dickstein's interesting study of the Ode (Keats and His Poetry, p. 225) also takes Wasserman to task at this point, though in different terms.</page><page sequence="20">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 101 enjoy'd, / For ever panting, and for ever young" (lines 26-27). Contrary to Wasserman's belief, Keats's elliptical syntax generates a meaningful ambiguity in the lines All breathing human passion far above, That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd, A burning forehead, and a parching tongue. (lines 28-30) Although these lines can be read as an affirmation of the superiority of the urn-figures' condition, they can also be seen as an ironic reversal and the speaker's recognition that the reality of the urn-figures' pleasure-seeking is neither better nor worse than human life, but simply radically different, of dubious relevance and meaning to man.21 Would a lover feel "a burn- ing forehead, and a parching tongue" (line 30) any less from a love "For ever warm" and "For ever panting" than from the ebb and flow of passion on earth, even with its inevitable awareness of loss? Which would be more "high-sorrowful" and cloying-life on earth or an existence utterly with- out change? For the urn-figures "Beauty is truth"; for them a love forever warm and panting does not fever and parch. But their joys are not meant for man; their ideal love holds no underlying significance or value for man beyond their distinctive and lovely appearance. The speaker knows truths that are not beautiful. For him, even Summer's joys are spoilt by use, And the enjoying of the spring Fades as does its blossoming; 21. In the line "All breathing human passion far above," the speaker may simply be remarking how "far above" and distinct from ordinary human passion the breathless urn- lovers are and thus seemingly asserting their superiority to cloying, sorrowful human passion. But the very statement of the claim as it completes itself in the last two lines of the stanza calls the significance of the claim into question. If we read the eighth line in this sense, it is perhaps less likely but still conceivable that the last two lines stand in apposition to the passion depicted on the urn rather than to human passion. We are invited by the syntax to consider that possibility, even if we ultimately reject it. What had seemed like unqualified praise be- comes at least somewhat problematic. Moreover, if we read the eighth line as the speaker's fanciful attribution of "breathing human passion" to figures "far above" the human con- dition, as still one more poetic, imaginative projection of a reality-illusion finally irrelevant to the urn's atemporal illusion of life-however important to the poet's-we are led with the speaker into a genuine paradox. Reading the eighth line in this sense makes it much more likely that syntactically the last two lines stand in apposition to the passion depicted on the urn than to human passion. Imagining the urn-figures so nearly human engenders questions in the speaker that the urn's art cannot answer, does not even ask,</page><page sequence="21">102 Keats-Shelley Journal Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too, Blushing through the mist and dew, Cloys with tasting. "Fancy," (lines o-1is5) In fact, is it not likely that the narrator's insistent repetition of "happy" in Stanza m is Keats's playful, rhetorical device to underscore the ironic fact that for man the same diet, even a diet of happiness, soon cloys with tasting?22 As several critics have pointed out, the structure of the fourth stanza recapitulates and condenses the essential development of the Ode to this point. It opens with a return to the questioning posture with which the poem had begun, though now the poet concerns himself with another aspect of the urn's "Sylvan" history, a seemingly sober sacrificial proces- sion, not the animated pleasure-seeking of Stanzas rn and m.23 Then, as in his earlier quest for "knowledge" of the urn, the poet's visionary imagina- tion proceeds to extrapolate from the fixed activity depicted, projecting that activity into another dimension of reality-illusion not relevant to the urn's designs. He imagines a past and future for an activity that, in terms of the urn's art, has none, though the activity suggests them. Finally, as in the conclusion of the third stanza, the fourth ends with another ironic reversal as the urn yet again teases him out of thought. And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return. (lines 38-40) Cleanth Brooks has given us the most helpful means of unravelling the imaginative reasoning behind the mysterious melancholy in these lines when he urges us to keep in mind that the poet-speaker has himself imagined the town and the special character of its desolation and loneli- ness. But it does not follow that this "ingenious fancy" is a "gratuitous and 22. SeeDavidPerkins, The QuestforPermanence, p.238, for an anticipation of this argument. 23. A number of critics (Cleanth Brooks, The Well Wrought Urn, pp. 147-148; C. M. Bowra, The Romantic Imagination, p. 133; Earl Wasserman, The Finer Tone, p. 44; Albert Gerard, "Romance and Reality: Continuity and Growth in Keats's View of Art," Keats- Shelley Journal, 2 [1962], 26; Walter Evert, Aesthetic and Myth in the Poetry of Keats, p. 316) have attempted to explain the significance of this second scene on the urn; but the most important fact about the "mysterious priest" and procession is that it calls for some explana- tion. The central fact, for the speaker, is its mysteriousness, the suggestion of some signifi- cance below the surface.</page><page sequence="22">Psyche's Bliss and the Grecian Urn 103 finally silly" confusion of art and life because no one "will ever discover the town except by the same process by which Keats has discovered it... and then, of course, he will not need to ask why it is empty."24 There is no reason to suspect, as Brooks does, that the poet ever conceives of the little town as "real," that is, as anything more than a figment of his own imagination, a part of his little "rhyme." His feeling of desolation and arrest at the little town's silence can ultimately be no other than an imagi- native experience, just as no man "really" experiences but only imagines the potential desolation, the sheer vacancy, of "eternity." The poet-speaker would certainly agree with Brooks that no one will ever discover the town except through the figured urn because only the speaker or his like, only a poetic imagination, would ever search it out. But this imaginative dis- covery and bewilderment are in no sense gratuitous or silly. The poetic imagination does not search out this town to learn the whereabouts of its inhabitants: the question is not where they are, but why they are where they are. The poet needs to ask "why it is empty" because the processional scene on the urn yields no resolution, no meaning for man in itself, though it clearly implies some significance. In coming upon the town, we discover to our bewilderment and disillusionment that the beautiful shape of the urn is merely a tease enticing the imagination on to penetrate the mystery of its beautiful form, but ultimately refusing our aroused desire to know her. She will not yield her secrets to man but, ironically, only to quietness. The calculated ambiguity in "and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate, can e'er return" suggests simultaneously the urn's glory and its great limitation relative to human life. The negative phrasing does not eradicate the positive aspect of this vision. In terms of the logic of the urn's art, "not a soul... can e'er return" is corollary to the affirmation in "She cannot fade." Though the speaker has pursued his imaginative speculations into a disappointing, melancholy realization, part of that recognition is that his vision has relevance and meaning only to his own imaginative life and "rhyme." He realizes that it is of the essence of the urn's "timeless" illusion not to picture the desolate town, however irresistibly enticing such unseen implications are to his temporal imagination given what is pictured on the urn. The urn's glory is that it has nothing to do with desolation and loss-that for it "Beauty is truth," and the only truth its beauty. To 24. The Well Wrought Urn, p. 148.</page><page sequence="23">104 Keats-Shelley Journal the poet's imagination, however, which can only conceive the "eternity" of arrested activity on the urn in temporal terms in order to discover any significance in it for man, the vision of the urn's world, without desolation and loss, turns dialectically upon itself into a world more appallingly and utterly desolate and forlorn than anything the self's real experience can confront in human life. With this discovery the poet-speaker ends his flirtation with the urn. He will no longer take his imaginative part in her teasing games, no longer heed the siren call that seems to suggest a meaning for man not to be found in his native homeland on earth, married to the mingled world of fulfill- ment and loss. In the final stanza the speaker keeps his distance, whimsi- cally exposing the urn for what she is to the other men who will follow him. It does not matter in which way one reads the final line and a half-as a continuation of the urn's speech to men or as the poet's interruption, addressed to the urn or the figures on it-the effect is in either case ironi- cal.25 Of more significance at the conclusion is the detached gaiety and equanimity with which the speaker both praises and dismisses the urn. His imaginative flirtation with the urn has brought home to him a truer and greater appreciation of the nagging, but "earthy," mistress he half- desired to forget-the "World of Pains and troubles" (1,lo2)-the only mistress who, however tormenting, can yield satisfying knowledge and the Soul's "bliss," the only mistress with whom he can create. His imaginative vision of the subtle torment of a love ceaselessly warm and panting, unlike changeful human passion, and the vision of utter desolation, perhaps like eternity but quite unlike the self's experience of desolation and loss on earth, have convinced the speaker's imaginative will that it would "rather bear those ills we have / Than fly to others that we know not of." The speaker is ready, in the end, like the Indian Maiden of Endymion, to take the world of Sorrow as his helpmate, concluding in the implicit acceptance of the Wordsworthian marriage metaphor that underlies Soul-making and the "Ode to Psyche": the "discerning intellect of Man /... wedded to this goodly universe / In love and holy passion."
