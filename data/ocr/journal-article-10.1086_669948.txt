      <p>If drapery in northern European art from about 1400 (Fig. 1) hangs with little resistance, the hard or angular style of drapery that replaced it asserts a stubborn autonomy (Fig. 2). By the third decade of the fifteenth century, stiff creases that break free of the bodies that support them had supplanted the gentle curves of the soft style.<sup>1</sup>

      <p>For Wilhelm Worringer, writing at the dawn of the twentieth century, the differences between the hard style and the soft were less important than what they shared. Hard or soft, Gothic drapery is a form of abstraction, according to Worringer. In his <italic>Abstraction and Empathy: A Contribution to the Psychology of Style</italic> (1907)—a sweeping theory of the historical oscillation between nonmimetically and mimetically driven art—Worringer goes so far as to say: “the abstract tendencies of the Northern artistic volition rose to an apotheosis in the treatment of drapery.”<sup>2</sup> Worringer developed this thesis further in his <italic>Form in Gothic</italic> (1911), where he refers to “the drapery which the Gothic artist made the focus of non-actuality, an artful chaos of violently agitated lines.”<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>I will suggest in this essay that Worringer got something right when he described Gothic drapery—at least in its late, hard instantiation—as a form of abstraction.<sup>4</sup> Yet I will also argue, with the help of Friedrich Ohly, in particular his essay on medieval <italic>Dingbedeutung</italic> (thing-meaning), that this abstraction is less a matter of escaping the material world, as Worringer characterizes it, than mapping the material ground of the image itself.<sup>5</sup> In its reflexive allusion to the surface and limits of the image, especially its corners, hard-style drapery insists on what we might, in light of Ohly's argument, call the image's own thingness.</p>
      <p>My essay is meant to do three things: account for the shift about 1430 to that rather peculiar style of drapery known as the hard style by linking its angularity to the corners of the images in which it appears; show that Worringer's unabashedly modern description of Late Gothic drapery as a form of abstraction is useful for thinking about this link; and, in the second half of the essay, demonstrate with Ohly's help that all this is not the strictly formalist matter that my invocation of the formalist Worringer might lead one to assume.</p>

         <title>The Corners of Paintings</title>
         <p>Otto Pächt discovers a latent thematic content in the angularity of hard-style folds: namely, the suffering of Christ. In a discussion of an Early Netherlandish painting of the Deposition from the Cross, he suggests that Christ's painful separation from his mother “sounds the keynote for the forming of every detail: the broken line in the draperies, the angular movement of the limbs, the zigzag of the outlines. Discontinuity is raised to the status of a motif in itself.”<sup>6</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In a <italic>Lamentation</italic> from Rogier van der Weyden's workshop, angular folds of cloth echo Christ's crooked elbow, as if their lengths indeed unfolded a metaphor for his suffering (Fig. 3). From the blue cloth draped over the Virgin's head, which follows the bend of Christ's left elbow, these angular creases continue into the more distant reaches of the framing figures' robes. In a <italic>Trinity</italic> painted by a follower of Robert Campin, the shroud and angels' robes fill the lower half of the picture with white cloth that likewise seems to “break” in sympathy with Christ's limbs (Fig. 4).<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>By midcentury, the hard style had spread from the southern Netherlands into the northern Netherlands and Germany, where artists including Konrad Witz and the Master ES took Christ's broken form as a motif to be elaborated—sometimes it almost seems to be parodied—in cloth (Figs. 5 and 6).<sup>7</sup> Judging from the isomorphic relation between the crooks in Christ's body and the kinks in the surrounding cloths in fifteenth-century northern European art, drapery may well have taken its cue in this period from Christ's redemptive suffering. Nonetheless, hard-style drapery is not keyed exclusively to this suffering. To begin with, it sometimes surrounds the intact infant body of Christ or some other figure entirely. Though the absence of the suffering or dead Christ from a given painting would not necessarily preclude his broken body from being the ultimate referent of that painting (and its drapery), hard-style drapery is too pervasive to be grounded in any one person's physical or psychic state—even such an exemplary figure as Christ.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>One need not look far to find another model for the angular folds in hard-style cloth: the corners of many of the images in which they appear. If the lines of the soft style give the impression of going on indefinitely, the lines of hard-style drapery always seem to be cut short.<sup>8</sup> In being cut short, these lines resemble the framing edges of rectangular images, that is, where those edges form corners. Hard-style drapery became popular during that period in which curvilinear Gothic frames were gradually giving way to the rectilinear frames of the Renaissance and later periods.<sup>9</sup> But even those late medieval altarpieces whose Gothic frames curve at the top generally have rectilinear corners below, where their straight sides and bottoms meet. By insisting, through sheer repetition, on these corners, where one side of the image intercepts the other, bringing its extension to an abrupt end, hard-style drapery reminds us that images have their limits.</p>
         <p>Though all images may have limits, not all are equally marked as such. The gold backgrounds typical of northern European panel paintings from around 1400 place the content of those paintings on a surface contiguous with their gold frames, which are contiguous, in turn, with the world of the viewer.<sup>10</sup> This contiguity helps make the persons depicted in the paintings, including the holy persons, seem available to their viewers.<sup>11</sup> For example, in an Annunciation panel that belongs to a quadriptych now split between Antwerp and Baltimore, the gold-leaf ground runs into the picture frame, pushing the angel forward as if into our space (Fig. 1). Only when illusionistic settings began to replace gold backgrounds like this one did the painting's framing edge really take on the quality of a cut.<sup>12</sup> In the North, this happened first in manuscript illuminations and then in the panel paintings of Jan van Eyck's generation. With this change, paintings began to resemble windows—of the kind that Leon Battista Alberti describes—opening on to worlds separate from those of their viewers.</p>
         <p>For Hans Belting, painting in the modern sense (which he names <italic>Gemälde</italic> in opposition to the more generic <italic>Malerei</italic>; the best term in English is probably <italic>easel painting</italic>, with all its modern connotations) originated at precisely this moment, when paintings began to look like views on to other spaces. Where earlier scholarship focused on style, describing a shift from the idealism of international courtly Gothic at 1400 to the bourgeois realism of 1430, Belting instead takes up the question of the medium itself, that is, the structure and symbolic significance of the easel painting as a format, as it emerged in the North. He argues that fifteenth-century Netherlandish painters attempted to recuperate the loss entailed in framing the picture as if it were a window.<sup>13</sup> They did this, he says, by treating “in the smallest format, on a framed image-surface, the greatest theme of all: the world, in which man lives, as a whole.”<sup>14</sup> Once painting ceased to be contiguous with the world, he suggests, it tried instead to squeeze the entirety of that world into its frame.<sup>15</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The desire to paint the whole world peaked, according to Belting, around the year 1500 in the work of Hieronymus Bosch: “Again and again, Bosch uses image-signs that bring into play the world in its entirety instead of grasping it only in a beautiful part. . . . The round format, which Bosch's paintings often have, gesture toward the gestalt of the world.”<sup>16</sup> Though he never says as much, Belting's discussion of Bosch's predilection for round formats implies that by 1500 the rectangle had acquired the aura of a fragment. If, at 1500, the circle could support the fantasy of a complete world picture, it was in part because the rectangular painting had come to look like an abridged version. Though Bosch may well have brought to a crisis the problem of painting's plenitude or lack thereof, Belting underestimates the extent to which the fifteenth-century tradition that Bosch inherited had already registered the impossibility of this ideal in the kinks of its hard-style folds, which repeatedly, even obsessively, reinscribe the limits of painting.</p>
         <p>Thomas Puttfarken has argued that Italian Renaissance painters did not, in fact, have a strong sense of paintings as bounded compositions. The impression that they did, he says, is an anachronistic fiction cooked up by twentieth-century formalists. Even Puttfarken, however, believes that such a conception of painting existed in the North.<sup>17</sup> When, in his treatise on painting of 1604, the painter and poet Karel van Mander addressed the framing edges of pictures, he put into words a long-established northern European studio practice of considering the disposition of elements within a bounded space.<sup>18</sup> Van Mander suggests: “At all times arrange things in accordance with the size of the space available, and make sure that the figures neither support the frame, nor lie cramped as if in boxes. Put your people in loosely, for a pleasant effect; don't allow your spirit to get so carried away that you make your things so large that hands and feet have to run into the frame, or lie uselessly twisted because you were constrained by the space.”<sup>19</sup>

         <p>In his Uffizi <italic>Lamentation in Front of the Tomb</italic>, Rogier van der Weyden does not commit the sin of boxing in his figures—as he does in some of his other paintings, including the Prado <italic>Deposition from the Cross</italic>—but he finds other ways of making us aware that their space is limited to what can fit within the frame (Fig. 7): the toes of the kneeling Magdalen, the corner of the stone slab beside her, and the edge of John the Evangelist's red robe all extend to just shy of the picture's edge. The shroud that trails from Christ's feet also calls attention to the picture's framing edge but in a less direct manner, as I will try to explain.<fig id="fg7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Ostensibly lying on the ground, the gray slab onto which the shroud spills tilts up toward the picture plane, dramatically setting off that trailing bit of white cloth against a field of gray. As if this monumental, upward-tilting stone slab were not enough to call attention to the shroud, Mary Magdalen and John the Evangelist each gesture toward it, her fingers and his toes coming right up to its edges without touching them (Fig. 8). Attending to the edges of this shroud leads us, eventually, to the edges of the painting, insofar as the shroud's rectilinear folds echo the edges of the slab, which echo the edges of the opening to the tomb, which echo, in turn, the edges of the painted panel itself.<fig id="fg8" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>In arguing that hard-style kinks like those in Rogier's <italic>Lamentation in Front of the Tomb</italic> echo not only the broken body of Christ but also the corners of the rectangular support that would become a hallmark of the modern easel painting, I do not mean to suggest a one-to-one correspondence. Hard-style drapery quickly became ubiquitous in the North. It shows up in manuscript illuminations, altarpieces, and prints as well. But when it appears in these other formats, I think we will tend to find that they share an essential feature of the modern easel painting: the illusion of an opening on to another space.</p>
         <p>In the mid-twentieth century—when the era of the easel painting seemed to be drawing to a close—Clement Greenberg again stressed this defining characteristic: “The easel painting, the movable picture hung on a wall, is a unique product of the West, with no real counterpart elsewhere. Its form is determined by its social function, which is precisely to hang on a wall. . . . It cuts the illusion of a box-like cavity into the wall behind it, and within this, as a unity, it organizes three-dimensional semblances.”<sup>20</sup> The modern easel painting, which is rectangular, independent of a larger ensemble, and usually relatively small, certainly represents the painting-as-window in its most realized form. But what about two-dimensional images that look like windows but do not otherwise meet this definition of an easel painting? Many fifteenth-century manuscript illuminations and altarpiece panels create box- or windowlike cavities despite the fact that they do not hang on walls. And many, if not all, of the pleasures and troubles associated with easel paintings proper escape from the Pandora's boxes that they seem to open. Though only some of the fifteenth-century images that I discuss in this essay are really easel paintings, they all raise questions about the kind of limit their framing edges represent.</p>
         <p>Then there is the issue of hard-style drapery in sculpture, much of which has no framing edge at all. In fact, it has often been surmised that hard-style drapery is hard because it originated in wood carving, where the intractable nature of the material is said to have given rise to angular shapes. Scholars have explained the crumpled quality of Albrecht Dürer's drapery, for example, by tracing it to sculpture.<sup>21</sup> This is a bit misleading. Even if Dürer's drapery derives in part from the influence of German sculpture, the drapery of that sculpture only really began to harden—that is, its folds only became truly angular— after the drapery styles of Early Netherlandish painters had made an impact on it, either directly or indirectly through the engravings of the Master ES and Martin Schongauer.<sup>22</sup>
         </p>
         <p>If the hard style has its origins in a particular medium, that medium is probably painting rather than sculpture.<sup>23</sup> Moreover, before being translated into three dimensions, the hard style seems to have reached its apogee in that other two-dimensional medium—engraving. The hard style was probably never harder (that is, more angular) than in the engravings of the Master ES and Schongauer. By the time it made its way in the later fifteenth century into sculpture—the reputed source of Dürer's <italic>Faltenstil</italic>—it had softened a bit. So, though it is far from exclusive to painting, hard-style drapery nonetheless, I would suggest, bears a special relation to that two-dimensional format.</p>
         <p>To focus on the framing edges of pictures is to address a topic dear to many formalists of the twentieth century. In taking up this issue, however, my aim is to counter one of their foundational claims: that a work of art is an autonomous entity, whose interpretation, even where it opens on to larger cultural issues, should not violate that work's self-sufficient integrity. For Pächt, the description of a work of art depends on “an inner grasp of the coherence of the whole.”<sup>24</sup> Worringer calls the work of art an “autonomous organism.”<sup>25</sup> For Worringer, abstraction is particularly effective in sealing the work of art off from the rest of the world, as a “closed material individuality.”<sup>26</sup> Abstraction gives the impression, he says, of purifying painting “of all dependence upon the things of the outer world, as well as from the contemplating subject himself.”<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In calling attention to the corners of paintings, however, hard-style drapery does not make those corners into emblems of painting's closure. On the contrary, this drapery seems designed to make us see these paintings as fragments of a larger whole—truncated bits of the world. In Rogier's Uffizi <italic>Lamentation in Front of the Tomb</italic>, the folds of the shroud form a pile of broken shapes. Inasmuch as this pile functions as a reflexive metaphor for the painting in which it appears, it characterizes that painting as anything but complete. Where Rogier crops the stone slab below John the Evangelist's feet, he insists again on this same kind of fragmentation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc2">
         <title>The Flatness of Abstraction</title>
         <p>Flatness is fundamental to the abstraction of Gothic drapery, including hard-style drapery, as Worringer describes it. In fact, for Worringer, flatness is an essential characteristic of all abstraction, which he associates with geometric and lifeless shapes.<sup>28</sup> Abstraction tends toward flatness, he says, because it seeks to lift phenomena out of the spatial (and temporal) flux of experience into a condition of static permanence.<sup>29</sup> By contrast, the work of art shaped by empathy is a “theater for the free, unimpeded activation of [the viewer's] own sense of life.”<sup>30</sup> Empathic art celebrates vitality, movement, and our shifting perceptions of the world. In its flattering mirroring of human life, Worringer says, it favors organic and animate shapes. If abstraction represents the subject's frightened desire to flee the three-dimensional world, the empathic work of art enables a happy flowing of one into the other.<sup>31</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Worringer understands Gothic art to be a hybrid of these two poles. In Gothic art, “the conception of actuality is concentrated in all its intensity in the naturalistic treatment of the face.”<sup>32</sup> This naturalism contrasts with Gothic drapery's “superactual, fantastic play of line, uncontrolled by an object.”<sup>33</sup> For Worringer, “the whole development of the Gothic art of representation is determined by this counterplay and interplay.”<sup>34</sup> I find this “counterplay and interplay” easier to make out in the hard style than in the soft.<sup>35</sup> In the soft-style <italic>Annunciation</italic> in Baltimore, which I discussed earlier, the Virgin's blue mantle is of a piece with the rest of the composition—neither more nor less flat than other things in the painting (Fig. 1). Hard-style drapery, by contrast, tends to erupt as a break in the spatial logic of the picture. Colonizing the foregrounds of Early Netherlandish paintings, for example, <italic>Virgin and Child before a Fire Screen</italic>, hard-style drapery takes up more space, more emphatically, than its softer predecessor (Fig. 2).<sup>36</sup> Rarely in Early Netherlandish paintings do the bodies and other things—of which there tend to be very many—quite share the flatness of hard-style cloth. The abstraction of hard-style drapery depends on this contrast.</p>
         <p>In Van Eyck's <italic>Lucca Madonna</italic>, an expanse of red cloth stretches across about one-third of the composition, intercepting our gaze as it moves into the painting's illusionistic chamber (Fig. 9). The tension between the depth-describing elements of this painting and this depth-denying red cloth is most acute along the left edge of the throne, where the wooden platform meets the Virgin's jewel-encrusted hem. Here the orthogonal line that describes the edge of the platform changes course only slightly to become the nearly vertical contour of the Virgin's monumental shape.<sup>37</sup> This alignment of horizontal platform and upright figure makes it difficult to distinguish between forms that run perpendicular to the picture plane and forms that run parallel to it. The double red band bordering the carpet extends this ambiguity down to the bottom of the painting, and the thin red line edging the cloth of honor carries it up toward the top, extending the flatness of the red mantle well beyond its own reach.<fig id="fg9" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>If Worringer were to describe Van Eyck's construction of this mantle, he might say that the painter has translated “depth relations into surface relations,” pushing the mantle's hidden sides into the light and, thereby, overcoming the limitations of any single subjective point of view.<sup>38</sup> Indeed, the shallowness and lateral spread of the Virgin's mantle counteract the essentially secretive nature of its folds. There would be little to discover in these folds by unfolding them; they are that shallow. Nor would we gain much information by viewing them from a different angle, whereas we might well learn something about the hidden side of the infant's face by moving a bit to the right. Our ordinary bodily relation to objects in three-dimensional space is largely irrelevant to our experience of this relatively flat expanse of cloth.</p>
         <p>For Worringer, a “spiritual dread” of three-dimensional space motivates this kind of flattening. Space is dreadful, he explains, in that it prevents us from seeing objects in their entirety and knowing them in their immutable truth.<sup>39</sup> With so little to suggest dread in Van Eyck's painting, however, his translation of depth into surface would seem to be less a matter of overcoming the limits of human perception than of inviting us to see the surface of his own painting. Though Worringer routinely overlooks this kind of reflexivity in abstraction, he nonetheless acknowledges that abstraction is about making the “material individuality” of objects—including the individual work of art—palpable to the viewer.<sup>40</sup> To the extent that Gothic drapery is a form of abstraction, then, it facilitates our apprehension of the painting as object.</p>
         <p>Though Worringer's attention to the abstract flatness of Gothic drapery clearly reflects his own historical moment—the eve of the birth of twentieth-century abstract art—it is not entirely anachronistic. Descriptions of Late Gothic drapery as flat and accounts of the difference between it and other aspects of the paintings in which it appears were already in place when Van Mander wrote his treatise in 1604. Van Mander quotes his teacher Lucas de Heere's commentary on Van Eyck's <italic>Ghent Altarpiece</italic>. Writing in the mid-sixteenth century, De Heere says that Van Eyck's rendering of faces and just about everything else is perfect, except his draperies. Regarding these, De Heere can muster only: “good draperies—at least considering those times” (Fig. 10).<sup>41</sup> According to Van Mander, only with Albrecht Dürer was there a decisive break with the “confused” drapery of earlier periods.<sup>42</sup> Even with Dürer, though, we have to wait for the later work, and, even there, Dürer's break with the hard style is not as complete as Van Mander would like it to be (Fig. 11).<sup>43</sup>

         <p>What Van Mander finds lacking in the hard style is evidence of observation of the variety of forms that different kinds of cloth take as they fold.<sup>44</sup> Also lacking for Van Mander is a meaningful relationship between hard-style folds and the bodies that make them. He admonishes painters that “the folds must come out of each other, spreading from something that sticks out or that pushes the material outwards.”<sup>45</sup> Hard-style drapery breaks this rule as a matter of course. Rarely originating from a protrusion, hard-style folds fail to achieve the volume that Van Mander would like. Van Mander also feels that the folds of the hard style are too angular or, as he says, “broken”: “one must not crumple the fabric too much, confusedly and laboriously, as if it were all ravaged and broken. Many earlier painters went awry in this way out of a lack of understanding.”<sup>46</sup> When Worringer describes Late Gothic drapery as flat and when he refers to it as “crinkled, angular, brittle drapery,” he is in agreement with De Heere and Van Mander.<sup>47</sup> He differs from these earlier historians of Netherlandish art only in his admiration for exactly what they disdain and in his dignifying of it with the name <italic>abstraction</italic>.<sup>48</sup>
         </p>
         <p>From its beginnings in the fifteenth century, hard-style drapery must have struck viewers, as it would strike De Heere and Van Mander (and later Worringer), as spatially and stylistically distinct from the objects around it. But its sheer celebratory abundance suggests that its earliest viewers could hardly have regarded the flat and broken manner as something to be overcome. Like Worringer yet with a much closer eye to particulars, Pächt tries to give a positive account of why certain things in Early Netherlandish paintings, including the draperies, often look so surprisingly flat: “the path toward perspectival correctness was blocked not so much by inadequate (technical) ability as by <italic>positive compulsion</italic>, namely, the pressure, <italic>to project three-dimensional space onto the surface in such a way as to yield an aesthetically relevant order</italic>.”<sup>49</sup> Fifteenth-century northern composition is governed by two (often competing) aims, according to Pächt: the arrangement of objects within illusionistic space and the satisfying organization of these same objects on the level of the picture plane. The latter explains why hard-style drapery so often seems to organize itself in relation to the surface of the picture rather than in accordance with its illusionistic depths.</p>
         <p>As much as Pächt's argument explains, it suffers from a typically formalist tendency to discover closure and unity exactly where they are lacking: “The impression of completeness [that a fifteenth-century northern painting gives] is grounded first of all on a particular accentuation of the picture's edge, through which an internal picture frame is created.”<sup>50</sup> As examples of such internal frames, Pächt mentions “doorposts, ceiling beams, the erect contour of a human figure's back.”<sup>51</sup> While flat expanses of hard-style drapery with their sharply cut folds also accentuate the picture's surface, edge, and particularly its corners, they do not at all add to any impression we might have of the painting as a “self-contained whole.”<sup>52</sup> On the contrary, in calling attention to the painting's limits, they remind us that, where that painting ends, a whole world of other things immediately begins.</p>

         <title>The Properties of Things</title>
         <p>Insofar as the flat, angular abstraction of hard-style drapery calls attention to the painting's status as a thing among other things, it does not exclude the world beyond the painting—as abstraction is so often said to do. To really see how external things press in on Early Netherlandish paintings, we must turn to Ohly's discussion of how things in general were thought to relate to one another in certain medieval systems of interpretation. In these modes of interpretation, as Ohly describes them, it is the properties of a thing that carry its meaning: “The properties of the thing are what bear its signification, and the number of possible meanings of a thing is fixed by the number of its properties.”<sup>53</sup> Things differ from the words that name them, therefore, in that they have more than a few meanings. Ohly quotes Richard of St. Victor: “The sounds of words do not have more than two or three meanings. But things can have as many meanings as they have properties.”<sup>54</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The meaning of any given property is in turn multiple: “If a thing's world of signification develops from the aggregate of its properties, that of the property . . . develops from the aggregate of things to which it may refer.”<sup>55</sup> Because of this, the properties of a thing can lead the interpreter to any number of otherwise unrelated things: “In a shift from the thing ‘feather’ to the property ‘silver-colored’—which, because of its frequency, might almost be called characteristic of the interpretation of things—the interpretation then finds its way to the thing ‘silver’ [as in the metal].”<sup>56</sup> In such a world, to know a thing is to bear in mind all the many other things that share its properties.</p>
         <p>The meanings of things are more abundant than the meanings of words, according to Hugh of St. Victor, because things are made by God: “The meaning of things is much more excellent than the meaning of the sounds of words, because custom determined the latter, but nature determined the former. The latter is the voice of men, the former the voice of God to men.”<sup>57</sup> Anonymous of Clairvaux makes the same distinction: “The sounds of words have their meaning by human, things by divine, ordinance. For as man indicates his will by words to another, God does so through created things.”<sup>58</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Ohly reins in the divine polysemy of created things, however, by reminding us that the correct interpretation of a thing ultimately depends on which of its many possible senses is relevant to the textual context in which it appears: “It is the task of the Middle Ages to elucidate the world of meanings (<italic>Bedeutungswelt</italic>) invested in things since Creation as the sum of possible spiritual meanings, in order to be able to apply it in the concrete instance through the discovery of the appropriate meaning.”<sup>59</sup> This means that interpretation will often entail a difficult act of selection. In some cases, however, this selection may in fact be impossible, since a single meaning will not necessarily answer to all the various contextual pressures that bear on a thing even in one particular instance—whether in a text or, as we will see, in an image.</p>
         <p>Transposing the distinction between (man-made) word and (god-given) thing onto the visual arts, we might say that, insofar as images picture things, they have their meaning by virtue of an implicit agreement between the painter and the viewer. For example, we may agree that certain two-dimensional shapes laid down on panel or parchment represent three-dimensional objects. To the extent that their relation to the things they represent is conventional (and limited), such images of things are like the words we use to name them. Where the shapes laid down on a two-dimensional surface do not clearly represent things—where, for example, we might be inclined to call them abstract—we have a somewhat different situation.</p>
         <p>In his discussions of medieval stained-glass windows and illuminated manuscripts, in which Ohly himself begins to do the work of transposing his word/thing opposition onto images, he quickly comes up against the problem of properties—specifically colors—that appear detached from objects. He even uses the adjective “abstract” to refer to this detached state: “The Annunciation in a Cologne sacramentary represents Mary and the angel in a concrete scene of bold architecture in front of a cloudlike abstract green that stands in space like a miracle” (Fig. 12).<sup>60</sup> Intervening between the relatively solid architecture in the background and the human figures in the foreground, greenness here belongs to no thing. The free-floating existence of this property is difficult to describe. A little farther along, Ohly uses the term “de-objectified”: <disp-quote>
               <p>There is the phenomenon that properties, like colors, no longer visibly linked to a thing, seem to have a meaning of their own. Thus, at the time of the Annunciation, in a scene filled with objects, buildings, towers, cupolas, and Mary's throne, in the presence of a sort of numinous miracle in a de-objectified green . . . color has acquired a life of its own that is only itself, in order, as such, to signify something.<sup>61</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> As a deobjectified property, this greenness demands interpretation in a way that the surrounding colors, which are more closely bound to objects, do not. It is easy to feel, for example, that we understand this miniature whether or not we have attributed any particular meaning to the blues and reds in the background, because they belong so clearly to the buildings whose properties they are. But I wonder if the greenness swirling between the Virgin and angel is really quite as deobjectified as Ohly says. While it may perhaps not be a property of any object pictured in the painting, it is indeed a property of the paint that was used to make it.<fig id="fg12" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>When this Cologne sacramentary was illuminated around the year 1000, the paint with which it was decorated was unlikely to have entirely escaped notice.<sup>62</sup> Four hundred years later, when Van Eyck was experimenting with oils as a vehicle for his pigments, paint as such would have been, if anything, harder to overlook. Van Eyck's reputation, and the reputation of Early Netherlandish painters in general, rested in no small measure on the seemingly magical properties of their oil paints. Already in 1456 Bartholomaeus Facius could write: “Jan of Gaul has been judged the leading painter of our time. . . . He is thought . . . to have discovered many things about the properties of [oil] colours.”<sup>63</sup> Oil paints were particularly admired for their highly saturated and seamless fields of color. In extolling their virtues, Van Mander explains that “they did not need to be hatched,” unlike tempera paint, which had to be applied in many small strokes to create the appearance of a solid field of color.<sup>64</sup>
         </p>
         <p>For Van Mander, the art of painting is first and foremost a matter of creating these fields of color. In the title of the twelfth chapter of his <italic>Foundations of the Noble and Free Art of Painting</italic>, he simply equates the two: “On the Fine Art of Painting, or Coloring” (Van wel schilderen, oft Coloreren).<sup>65</sup> Unlike Giorgio Vasari, Van Mander does not privilege <italic>disegno</italic> over <italic>colorito</italic>.<sup>66</sup> In fact, in addition to saying that “the most important thing is painting well,”<sup>67</sup> he traces the origins of “coloring” all the way back to Creation: “In the beginning, when all created things received their origin, form, and being from their most praiseworthy creator, everything that the eye can see . . . received its color from this most artful image-maker and painter.”<sup>68</sup> For Van Mander, color is what makes “everything that God has created in the world visible.”<sup>69</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Van Mander borrows much of what he says about color from a handbook of the fifteenth century, <italic>Le blason des couleurs en armes, livrées et devises: Livre très utille et subtil pour sçavoir et congnoistre d'une &amp; chacune couleur la vertu et propriété</italic>.<sup>70</sup> To the extent that his attitude toward color can be traced back to the fifteenth century, Van Mander brings us a little closer to understanding the surprisingly large monochrome passages of drapery in Early Netherlandish paintings. Though richly modulated from light to dark, the red mantle in the <italic>Lucca Madonna</italic>, for example, is a much larger area of a single hue than we find anywhere else in the painting, and this is typical of hard-style drapery.<sup>71</sup> In a context in which nothing was held to be more essential to painting than color, these swaths of single hues would have registered as painting in its most elemental form: its degree zero, if you will.<sup>72</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The medieval exegesis of things that Ohly describes turns out to be a materialist formalism, wherein the formal properties of things—their shapes, colors, and so on—bring to mind myriad other material things that also bear those properties. The significance of the redness of the mantle in Van Eyck's <italic>Lucca Madonna</italic> cannot be limited to an association with Christ's Passion, for instance, because redness is capable of evoking every other red thing—every other red thing, that is, including the paint(ing) to which the property of redness here, in fact, belongs.</p>
         <p>By exceeding without entirely abandoning the mimetic project of Early Netherlandish painting, hard-style drapery invites us to see in terms of properties, including the properties of the paintings in which it appears. The abstraction of the drapery in the <italic>Lucca Madonna</italic> encourages us to see in its redness the redness of the pigment Van Eyck painted it with, and in its flatness and brokenness the flatness and brokenness of the panel he painted it on. Far from isolating the painting, as a perfect and self-sufficient projection of an ideal form, the formalism that Ohly describes opens it to its contiguity with other things—in whose light its own thingness appears. In arguing that Ohly's materialist formalism ultimately turns back on the painting itself, I go further, I think, than he himself would allow. but, by forcing us to take into account the image's own thingness, Late Gothic abstraction blurs the distinction between image and thing that Ohly would like to draw.</p>

         <title>The Lining of Heaven</title>
         <p>Scholars have documented many instances of avant-garde artists finding and appropriating for their own “nonobjective” experiments what they considered to be abstraction in premodern art—including ancient Iberian sculptures, medieval German woodcuts and paintings on glass, and Byzantine icons. It is not by chance that their contemporary Worringer discovered his own version of abstraction in old and marginalized images. But rather than trace the ways in which premodern art forms influenced the development of twentieth-century abstraction, my aim here has been to follow Worringer in seeing what twentieth-century abstraction can show us about Early Netherlandish painting that strictly historical, which is to say, humanistic, modes of analysis are unlikely to reveal.</p>
         <p>Worringer's association with Expressionism has given rise to the assumption that he celebrated abstraction as an outpouring of subjective feeling.<sup>73</sup> In fact, he repeatedly describes abstraction as the impersonal, inorganic, and even inhuman counterpart to empathy's anthropomorphic picture of the world.<sup>74</sup> Abstraction, Worringer explains, is motivated by a desire to move outside the realm of lived human experience. As such, it can either pull us down below the human—“down from the pride of knowledge”—into a primitive state or elevate us above the human.<sup>75</sup> As the most primitive of artistic impulses, abstraction is rooted in the viewer's “somatic and psychic constitution” and in the “morphological law of crystalline-inorganic matter,”<sup>76</sup> yet it also corresponds to a desire to transcend the physical world.<sup>77</sup> While abstraction's geometric forms anchor us in our bodies and in matter, they also lift us somehow above the sensuous plane.</p>
         <p>Worringer's recognition of abstraction's competing materialist and transcendental aims would turn out to be prophetic for twentieth-century abstract painting, which had not even quite begun when he published <italic>Abstraction and Empathy</italic> in 1907.<sup>78</sup> His prescience in this regard is related to his recognition of the tension between abstraction and humanist ideology. Worringer's antihumanistic (and primitivist) theory of abstraction differs, as Hal Foster has pointed out, from later celebrations of abstraction as a form of artistic mastery.<sup>79</sup> Though Worringer certainly thinks that abstraction reflects a desire to control the world, he does not seem to believe that such mastery is actually within human reach. The dream of transcending the contingencies of existence is never more than a fantasy; the waxing and waning of abstraction through the ages marks this fact.<sup>80</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As Worringer seems to have anticipated, twentieth-century abstraction has been shaped by diametrically opposed impulses—sometimes to be discovered within the very same artist or work: on the one hand, the desire to represent something immaterial (in Kazimir Malevich's case, “pure sensation,” the “fifth dimension,” “economy,” “infinity,” “nothing”) and, on the other hand, the will to expose the material conditions of painting, often by deducing the painting's figures (for example, the red quadrangle in Fig. 13) from the flatness and shape of the canvas itself.<sup>81</sup> For Malevich, these opposing impulses reflect an ideological divide that goes well beyond painting: “One side holds that true life is only in the spirit, the other that truth is in matter, and in this way there have arisen two movements in life—the spiritual and the material.”<sup>82</sup> Malevich insists, however, that this distinction is mere ideology: <disp-quote>
               <p>Under the pressure of investigation, things . . . disintegrate into a multitude of things, whose investigation will prove that these disintegrated things also in their turn disintegrated into independent things and bore a mass of new links and relations with new things, and so on ad infinitum. The investigation will prove that things do not exist, and at the same time there exists their infinity, “nothing” and at the same time “something.”<sup>83</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> Under the pressure of Malevich's investigation, the utterly concrete, material thing that a painting is can begin to lose its substance. But while his own paintings often do seem to gesture toward this kind of transcendence, the best of them do so without shedding their resolute insistence on their own (manu)facture.<sup>84</sup>

         <p>Though Malevich may argue that there is no real distinction between the spiritual and the material, the most influential critic of postwar American abstraction seems to have felt compelled to choose. Greenberg's career can be divided into two largely irreconcilable phases. The turn in his thinking occurred in the mid-1950s, when he began to praise paintings for their optical rather than tactile qualities and painters for their idealist rather than materialist aims.<sup>85</sup> Where he had earlier applauded the picture that is “one with the pigment, the texture, and the flat surface that constituted it as an object,” he would eventually insist that, “like any other kind of picture, a modernist one succeeds when its identity as a picture, and as a pictorial experience, shuts out the awareness of it as a physical object.”<sup>86</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The quintessentially modernist tension between transcendence and truth to materials that sustained Malevich's career and divided Greenberg's is not unlike the tension one feels in those medieval encyclopedias and other books devoted to the world of terrestrial things that are the basis of Ohly's analysis of medieval <italic>Dingbedeutung</italic>, especially where the authors of those books justify their investigations of the natural world by asserting that in descending to the level of matter, they are able to ascend to a world of divinely given meaning: “All the arts are subject to divine wisdom and the lower science, properly regulated, leads to the higher,” writes Richard of St. Victor.<sup>87</sup> Hugh of St. Victor puts it in terms of fecundity: “The whole of nature speaks of God. . . . and nothing in the universe is sterile.”<sup>88</sup> If things disintegrate under Malevich's gaze into an infinity of other things, eventually giving way to the transcendence of nothing, medieval investigations of things likewise seem to bear fruit in the form of more things—the endless number of which marks the world as God's creation and allows the investigator to ascend, finally, to its maker.</p>
         <p>A miniature of the Agony in the Garden from the Turin-Milan Hours allegorizes this kind of ascent by way of a descent into the world of things (Fig. 14). Where Christ's torso and bent arms cross the horizon of the hill, they form the nexus of the upper half of the composition. Below this, the sleeping apostles nestle into rocks. One long line extends from the lower left corner, along the upper contour of Peter's red mantle, along the rock above his head, and along the top of the hill behind that rock, bisecting the composition diagonally and bundling apostles, rocks, and hillside into an aggregate entity.<fig id="fg14" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The apostles, rocks, and grassy hillside are further linked by properties they have in common: the drapery of the apostle to the far right shares its greenness with the grass, and the drapery of all three shares its “brokenness” with the rocks. Where the frame of the miniature crops the bodies of the sleeping apostles, it indicates that this picture is a window on to a fragment of a larger whole. But the properties of this framed fragment link it to the larger world from which it is separated. The redness and blueness of the apostles' robes reappear in the border of the miniature's frame, and flecks of these same two colors decorate the leaves sprouting from the vine that crawls over the surface of the manuscript page. The dissemination of the red and blue from within the miniature's fictive world over the flat surface of the parchment blurs the line between that fictive world and the larger world that is our own.</p>
         <p>If there is upward movement built into this composition, it extends along Christ's body, gathering strength as it narrows where his torso breaks through to the sky. This climactic moment is only possible because of our detour through the categorical confusion of the world below, where we have learned to see in terms of properties. It is this mode of seeing that allows us to climb from the blueness of Christ's earthly robe to the blueness of the heavens. But this mode also makes us aware that our interpretative movement can be ironically reversed. After all, there is nothing to stop our slipping from the blue ether back down to earth—that is, from what Richard of St. Victor calls the “higher science” back down into the low, albeit fecund, world of things—where we will discover the heavens now pooling (somewhat ignominiously) at Christ's feet.</p>
         <p>According to Ohly, this kind of slippage between heaven and earth was well accounted for in medieval exegesis: “since things have as many meanings as properties, while properties however can be both good and evil, the same thing can have good as well as evil meanings, those, as the Church Fathers already express it, <italic>in bonam partem</italic> [in a good sense], as well as those <italic>in malam partem</italic> [in an evil sense].”<sup>89</sup> Ohly does not seem to think this ever led to confusion. Though a “thing has a <italic>world</italic> of meanings, which extends from God to the devil,” in any given textual (or pictorial) instance, he explains, its meaning must be univocal: “in a concrete textual instance the lion [for example] cannot signify ‘God or the devil,’ but only one of them.”<sup>90</sup> While things in the world may have many meanings, things in texts (and pictures), Ohly says, have only one.</p>
         <p>If Ohly would have us choose between competing properties when it comes to the interpretation of things, it stands to reason that he would have us choose between competing things when it comes to the interpretation of properties. I think we would be hard pressed, though, to choose between the heavenly and baser things associated with the property of blueness as it appears in the Turin-Milan <italic>Agony in the Garden</italic>—and for good reason. To choose would be to unravel the image's fabric of associations.</p>
         <p>“I have conquered the lining of the heavenly,” Malevich boasts, “have torn it down and, making a bag, put in colours and tied it with a knot. Sail forth! The white, free chasm, infinity is before us.”<sup>91</sup> Bagging heaven is not an especially felicitous metaphor, whether in a late medieval miniature or a utopian, avant-garde rant. But its infelicity, in both cases, is precisely the point. While the metaphor may ask us to hold the material and the ethereal together, its awkwardness—the excessive literalness of turning heaven into a bag or a mound of crumpled cloth—blocks us, finally, from experiencing matter as a univocal expression of sense.</p>

         <title>Brokenness</title>
         <p>Everything fans out from St. Barbara's cinched waist, as if her impossibly tight belt were holding together not only her gown but also the composition (Fig. 15). Adorned with jewels that look like tacks pinning it down, her hem just barely touches the frame at lower right, extending up from there in a line roughly parallel to the edge of the panel. All this has the effect of pushing the gown up toward the vertical rectangle of the picture plane and setting it apart from the deep landscape around the tower, which bustles with the labor of building. Much of this labor involves the manipulation and transportation of stones that have not yet been transformed into masonry. The still raw material of rough-hewn stone would seem to have little to do with Barbara's gown, which is made of scarlet, as the supremely refined and most expensive of Flemish woolens was called, regardless of its color.<sup>92</sup> To produce scarlet, wool had to be washed, oiled, combed, carded, spun, woven, dyed, fulled, tentered, sheared, and teaselled.<sup>93</sup> Their differences notwithstanding, the pile of stones just beyond the hill to the right shares at least one property with the pile of folds in the foreground—the property of brokenness (Fig. 16).<fig id="fg15" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>In the medieval world of things that Ohly describes, where one sees in terms of properties, ordinary distinctions can give way, it seems, to other systems of relations. here, the distinctions that give way include not only those between the things that are represented (scarlet, stone, and so on) but also the distinction between what Greenberg calls the painting's “identity as a picture” and our “awareness of it as a physical object.”<sup>94</sup> For once we make the comparison between the brokenness of scarlet and the brokenness of stone, we are only a small step from seeing the brokenness of the physical line that describes them both. (The absence of color from Van Eyck's drawing on panel makes this step an especially easy one to take.<sup>95</sup>) As we bring this brokenness into focus, we begin to see abstractly, in a twofold sense: we see a physical property of the drawing's line rather than what it represents; and we see that physical aspect of the drawing's support to which this brokenness directs our eye—namely, its corners.</p>

         <title>Ohly's Worringer</title>
         <p>In the Late Middle Ages, the humanity of Christ became a subject of intense pictorial (as well as textual) investigation. Picturing Christ's human body became a matter of emphasizing its brokenness in opposition to the perfection of God. I have suggested here that, around this same time, as paintings tended more toward the rectangular and as they gained their independence from larger ensembles—in short, as the era of the easel painting took shape—paintings, too, came to be perceived as fragments of a more perfect whole: a world whose scope they could never possibly match. Drapery seems to have registered this double interest in brokenness, when the seemingly endless lines of the soft style gave way to the hard-style kinks found in Early Netherlandish paintings.<sup>96</sup>
         </p>
         <p>One probably needs to be at least a bit of a formalist to see things in this way. It is certainly Worringer's formalism (his sense that the cultural context of a work of art tells us little about it) that frees him to compare medieval and modern art and to discover the latter in the former.<sup>97</sup> While Ohly exercises no such freedom, he nevertheless acknowledges a medieval habit of finding relations between categorically different things that happen to share certain formal properties. Ohly's close, philological attention to specific texts and images is an effective antidote to Worringer's grandiose theorizing. But to take Ohly as antidote to Worringer is not to do away entirely with the latter's formalism. On the contrary, I hope to have shown that Ohly's own attention to form lends unexpected support to Worringer's thoroughly formalist thesis about the abstraction of Late Gothic drapery.</p>
         <p>Still, Ohly also helps us counter Worringer's typically formalist insistence on the autonomy of the work of art, the fantasy that it is complete unto itself. In the medieval context, Ohly suggests, attention to the formal properties of things opened them, in fact, to the plurality of the material world. Taken together, Worringer and Ohly show us that, in the abstraction of their hard-style folds, Early Netherlandish paintings, which appear to record a world of things beyond themselves, ask, in turn, to be seen as things—not as autonomous things but, rather, as things among the world's many other things.</p>
