The brevity of the fragment and the absence of direct elab- oration by Protagoras gave rise to endless controversy about its meaning. Already Sextus, as we see, immediately proceeds to interpret the key terms so as to clarify the fragment, and the terms he is here concerned with have been interpreted and reinterpreted even before him-by Plato and Aristotle-and cer- tainly ever since. As it obviously depends on their interpretation what kind of relativity Protagoras introduced, we too shall have to raise the question, whether, in the sentence, "man" means the individual or man in general; whether Ws means "that," "in what manner," or "how," whether xp' aTra are things or qualities; and finally, what kind of criterion or measure it is that Protagoras said man to be ? As these terms are inter- dependent, the interpretation of each mutually conditioning the meaning of the others, it is only after dealing with all of them that we begin to understand what Protagoras meant to convey. Although in the Theaetetus-of which dialogue Sextus' anal- ysis of the fragment is hardly independent-Plato seems to prefer the individual interpretation of the Protagorean "man," 1 the collective interpretation "all men" (and complete class- exclusion: no one, no man) which is at least numerically equiv- alent to mankind, man in general, also appears occasionally.2 The general interpretation is on the whole absent, although Socrates comes close to it when he ironically remarks: "I am surprised that he does not say . . .that a pig or a dog-headed ape or some even more absurd creature . . . is the measure of Theaet., 152 A, 158 A, 161 D, E, 166 C, 171 E, etc. 2 Theaet., 170 A: "man, or rather all men"; also ol 7roXXoi 170 E, Tb 7rX6os 171 A, d7ravras 171 A, B, racTrwv 171 C, etc., which are not offered as direct interpretations yet show how the "individual." often leads to the collective, a fact Protagoras could hardly be unaware of. 178</page><page sequence="2">PROTAGORAS' MAN-MEASURE FRAGMENT. all things" (161 C). The reason for this absence, however, is not so much that the " man in general" interpretation is foreign to Protagoras' thought, but rather that in the Theaetetus Plato uses Protagoras' sentence as a starting point for a discussion of knowledge qua perception, and dealing with perception and sensation, the individual, rather than man in general, is the obvious "measure" of what is and appears to him. In view of this we have to ask, now, whether Protagoras restricted the relativity expressed in the fragment to sense perception. At first glance the major portion of the Theaetetus seems to support this supposition, and in consequence of this restriction "man" is taken to mean each man, Us is replaced by ola, and Xp,qjuaTa are interpreted as 7TOLOTr7TE, perceived qualities, e.g. hot and cold, bitter and sweet, etc. Since these qualities were often considered as substances, prime elements, in Presocratic phi- losophy, it is not impossible that Protagoras should have written Xpv,=rara when referring to them.3 Nevertheless the sum of our evidence, in Plato and our other sources, points to the conclusion that this restriction, and the Theaetetus' theory of sense per- ception, are un-Protagorean. Plato himself seems to indicate this even in the Theaetetus, by his reference to Protagoras' "secret doctrine," by not directly ascribing the theory of perception and the equation of percep- tion and knowledge to Protagoras, but merely saying that in the end Protagoras' sentence and the Theaetetus' theory boil down to the same thing (160D), and finally by the "apology of Protagoras" where he lets the Sophist protest against Platonic misinterpretations of his view: "Treat what I say in a spirit more suitable to it" (166 C), Protagoras says, "and do not pursue the letter of my argument but get at its meaning more clearly" (166D), "and do not be unjust in your elenctic" (167 D,E) "nor inimical and quarrelsome" (168 B), but "find out what we really mean" and do not cause perplexity by per- verting my words (ibid. C). Furthermore, even apart from the apology of Protagoras, Plato is by no means consistent in restricting Protagorean relativity to sense perception in the Theaetetus, but it is at times opinions, thoughts, beliefs, and judgments that seem to be the xpuara in question.4 3 As von Fritz points out in his article on Protagoras in R.-., 'Theaet., 170, 171; cf. also Sextus, Adv. Math., VII, 60; Aristotle, Met., 1009a; Aet., Doxogr., 396b, 15. 17Y9</page><page sequence="3">LASZLO VERSENYI. All this is much more pronounced in the Protagoras and the "apology of Protagoras " in the Theaetetus, where no restriction of "man" to the individual and of xp l,ara to sense-qualities is evident, and this fact is all the more significant as both of these passages are likely to be more reliable representations of Prota- goras' views than the major portion of the Theaetetus.5 In the Protagoras-Apology it is neither just sense perceptions nor just the individual as measure that Protagoras is talking about: "whatever seems right and honorable to a city is right and honorable to it as long as it holds it to be so" (167 C), and the restriction is even more conspicuously absent in the Prota- goras, where the Sophist in fact answers Socrates' question concerning pigs and dog-headed apes as measure (Theaet., 161 C). "Are those things good which are profitable to men?" Socrates asks (Prot., 333 D), and in his answer Protagoras uses not only man qua species as the measure of goodness and utility (which are obviously not mere sense perceptions), but extends relativity all the way down the line. What is good for men is relative to (its usefulness for) men, what for horses, cattle, dogs, trees, etc., to horses, cattle, and so on. What is good for men may be bad for animals, and vice versa, what may be good for the roots of a tree may be bad for its shoots, what benefits the inward parts of man may harm the outside of the body .... Thus we see a diversity of "things" (fairness, justice, goodness, utility, nourishment, and their opposites) relative to an equal variety of "measures," which may be more inclusive (state, species of animals) or less inclusive (parts of man and things) than the individual. 5 In the Protagoras the Sophist is represented as alive, speaking in the first person; in the Theaetetus he is dead and has been dead a long time; furthermore the Protagoras belongs in a period in Plato's activity when -judging from his portrayal of Socrates-he is less inclined to take too great liberties with other peoples' views and to use them entirely as mouthpieces for his own thought; also in the Protagoras, and at the time of its writing, Plato still has a great deal of sympathy with and respect for the Sophist; all this diminishes as time goes by. As for the " apology of Protagoras " in the Theaetetus, it is likely to be more authentic than the rest of the dialogue, not only because it is told at least vicariously by Protagoras himself, but mainly because of its almost exact correspondence with the picture of Protagoras we get in the Protagoras and in our other sources. 180</page><page sequence="4">PROTAGORAS' MAN-MEASURE FRAGMENT. If further evidence is needed for the fact that the relativity the Protagorean fragment introduced went way beyond sense perception and the individual,6 we only need to refer to the anonymous Dissoi Logoi which exhibits strong Protagorean influence 7 and whose use of relativity shows the same lack of restriction to sensation and individuals. Here it is the good and the bad, the useful and the harmful (? 1), beautiful and ugly (?2), right and wrong (?3), true and false (?4), that are shown to be relative to different people, states, etc., in different situations. Also, in view of the correspondence between Dissoi Logoi, 2, 9-19, but especially 2, 18 and Herodotus, III, 38, we might add the latter's "if one proposed to all men to choose from all the customs or laws what seemed to them best, ... each would choose his own," and the following passage about the relativity of funeral customs, as examples of the extension of Protagorean 8 relativity to men, nations, etc., and of the relative Xplxlara in question not being mere perceptions and sensations. 6 T. Gomperz, H. Gomperz, H. Maier, W. Nestle, A. Levi, et al. all agree that the restriction is un-Protagorean. 7 The reasons for the general agreement on Dissoi Logoi being influ- enced by Protagoras are many. First the use, in ?? 1-4, of an ingenious antilogical scheme, with occasional blunders serious enough to make us doubt that they could have been committed by a skilful antilogist, thus leading to the inference that the writer took his scheme from someone else. Protagoras, the inventor, according to Diogenes Laertius, of antil- ogies naturally comes to mind, especially as the first sentence of Dissoi Logoi recalls the dovoL X6yot Diogenes attributes to Protagoras. (On the Protagorean origin of the antilogical scheme of 1-4 cf. H. Gomperz, Sophistik und Rhetorik; Nestle, Von Mythos zu Logos; Kranz in Hermes, LXXII; Levi in A. J. P., LXI.). Secondly, the antilogical scheme of Dissoi Logoi is rooted in Protagorean relativism. Thirdly, there is a striking material correspondence between Dissoi Logoi, 1-4, Protagoras' fragments 1, 5, Plato's Protagoras, 334 A, B, C; as well as between Dissoi Logoi, 6, Protagoras' fragments 3, 10, and 11, the myth and logos in Plato's Protagoras, Anonymus Iamblichi, and the Prota- goras-Apology in the Theaetetus, which makes the assumption plausible that each of these two groups of passages had a common Protagorean source. 8 On the relationship of Protagoras and Herodotus who both partici- pated in the foundation of Thurii, cf. Mass in Hermes, XXII, and Nestle, Platons Protagoras; Von Mythos zu Logos; and "Spuren d. Sophistik bei Isokrates," in Philologus, LXX. 181</page><page sequence="5">LASZLO VERSENYI. If the preceding interpretation of the meaning of "man" and "things " in the fragment is correct, Protagoras' use of the word XprWtara-rather than oVra or even 7rpdaytara-becomes exceedingly appropriate, for the original meaning of XPuaTra is not just things, beings, or objects in general, but things with a special relation to our involvement with them: things one uses or needs; goods, property, etc.; generalized into affairs, events, matters we are concerned with. xprtka is derived from xpr6aat, XpdolatL: to use, to have dealing with, to live with something-as in Xp. vooLts or avotlal; X. reXvr, XP. yVVatKI, XP. 7tvt os 4tAX, etc. In all these cases what is stressed is the connotation of our use of, dealing and living with, attitude and relation to a thing, and not what that thing may or may not be in itself.9 In this sense of the word, xprlla already implies a derpov, i. e. something in relation to which it is what it is, so that the frag- ment becomes nearly tautological, or at least trivial, for it takes no great insight or ingenuity to pronounce the relativity of things relative by definition, or to point out that man is the measure of things whose esence-by definition-depends on man's relationship to them. Taken, however, as a statement of principle at the very beginning of Protagoras' book, there is nothing trivial about the sentence. Narrowing down the con- temporary meaning of Xp?!ara-any thing, object, whatsoever- to its original connotation, Protagoras announces a practical program: The things we are concerned with are Xp/marTa, i.e. things we are decisively related to; thus there is no point in speaking in a grand manner about what things may or may not be in themselves; what we have to take into account and con- centrate on is what they are for us, in the world we live in, in a world in which our relationship to things, our living in the world, is decisive. If the sentence is understood in this manner, the controversy about the Us in the fragment, i.e. whether it means "that," 9 All this is not to say that the use of the word alone establishes our interpretation, for by Protagoras' time the meaning of xp,ula was much too general and all-inclusive to allow this, and we have no evidence indicating that Protagoras engaged in etymological research like Pro- dicus, trying to define and distinguish precise meanings. On the con- trary, it is our interpretation that makes Protagoras' use of Xpiuiara in the fragment seem appropriate. 182</page><page sequence="6">PROTAGORAS' MAN-MEASURE FRAGMENT. "in what manner," or "how," and whether the statement us ErLtv is existential, or a mere judgment of quality or value, becomes largely verbal. Since we are no longer dealing with abstract-theoretical questions concerning things in themselves, but with what things are for us, i. e. not with absolute but with relative existence, judgments of quality (hot-cold, bitter-sweet) and value (good, bad, fair, just, nourishing, harmful, appro- priate, unhealthy; food, poison, medicine) are judgments of existence. The what, how, and that of a xp;yia are determined in, defined by, and dependent on its region of use from which it (xp~xca) cannot be abstracted, for without this determining relation Xpx 'jara do not exist (qua XP laTa in the strict sense). There is not any further necessity either to try to assign a precise limit to what "man" denotes in the fragment, for the /ETrpov of any xpyp/a is neither man as the individual, nor men collec- tively, nor man in general, but simply whatever organism (indi- vidual, state, mankind, other animals, plants, etc.) is in the relation to it which determines it (its essence and existence) qua Xp-la.O The fact that the fragment says "man is the measure of all things," and not that the measure of a thing is that in relation to which it is what it is, i. e. the region into which qua Xprqxa it belongs, in no way conflicts with this conclusion. Protagoras obviously holds11 that the things a pig, a firefly, a dog-headed ape, or some still stranger creature may be concerned with are relative to each of these creatures. The point, however, is-and this is what the fragment is designed to emphasize-that we are neither pigs, nor dog-headed apes, nor some more bizarre creature (like the pure intellect of a Parmenides) but human beings, and thus, as far as we are concerned, man indeed (whether the indi- vidual, the state, or mankind) is the measure of things. If at first it seems merely tautological to say that things of our con- cern concern us, it is far from trivial to recall this at a time when men appear oblivious to the fact. At such time to remind man that he is not an abstract-theoretical chimera in communica- tion with objective-immutable absolute essences, but a living 10 On this interpretation of Xp/,Aa cf. Nestle, Von Mythos zu Logos. pp. 276 ff. 11 Cf. Prot., 333 D. 183</page><page sequence="7">LASZLO VERSENYI. human being, to point out that it is this world of xp'yara, within which he lives, that ultimately concerns him, and thus to recall him from the world of Parmenides and post-Parmenidean natural philosophy, in which he literally lost himself, into a world of practical action, all this is far from trivial; it is the thinker's first and most important task. And this is what Protagoras did. Pointing to the world in which our relationships, attitudes, and opinions are decisive, our concerns of utmost concern, he recalled man to himself. Were this not the case, Protagoras' insistence on relativity would be a great deal less significant. After all, lyric poetry 12 had already found value-judgments relative, Xenophanes had already derided the relativity of our anthropomorphic religious imagery, and Heracleitus emphasized the relativity of "private" judgment, long before the Sophists. It is Protagoras' historical position, i. e. that he radicalized and unified these views in the midst of and in opposition to natural philosophy's search for absolute, unchanging, universal first principles and substances, that gives his relativism the status of a much needed reform. While natural philosophy wanted-and thought itself capable of-getting away from what is merely human, relative, and con- ditioned, Protagoras in effect declared that this attempt is neither fruitful nor desirable. The world we live in and are able to know is the world of our relative, conditioned, human experience, and so instead of framing abstract hypotheses about the theoretical nature of the universe we had better return to everyday life and try to solve the problems that confront us here and now.13 LASZLO VERSENYI. WILLIAMS COLLEGE. 12 Cf. e.g. Archilochus, frs. 41, 68; Sappho, 16. 13 This attitude of Protagoras resembles that of Hippocratic medicine in general. It is especially interesting to read the Hippocratic On Ancient Medicine in this connection, for its explicit antagonism to the formulation of "empty hypotheses " and first principles, its advocacy of investigating "what man is in relation to foods and drinks and other habits," as well as its general insistence on relativity (and certain other traits), show a striking similarity to Protagoras' thought. 184</page></plain_text>
