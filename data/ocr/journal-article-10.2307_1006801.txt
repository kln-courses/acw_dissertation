Not content simply to trade with the indige- nous peoples from distant coastal forts or entirely new towns, the Spanish conquerors of Mexico moved right into Indian cities and, increasingly over time, Indian towns, villages, and their hinterlands. The conquerors' inten- tion behind living in such close proximity was to better extract the local peoples' services and tributes and to convert them more effectively to every aspect of Hispanic culture. From the moment of their arrival Hernando Cort6s and his followers sought to introduce a new king, a new god, and a new way of life into the land they called New Spain. What the indigenous peoples thought of this intrusion is, after all this time, something historians have only relatively recently begun to piece to- gether from fragmentary records. How did the newcomers and their designs appear to the original occupants of the land? What was accepted, what was rejected, and why-these are questions we now ask in pursuit of a more balanced perspective. We have begun to seek lessons that can be learned from those who experienced conquest and colonization, as we trace what became of the impressive civilizations and cultures that had emerged in this hemisphere prior to contact with Europe. The indigenous response to Christianity, and more specifically to Cathol- icism, is a subject of particular interest to students of cultural change. The massive evangelical programs of the sixteenth century seem, on the surface, to have reached and influenced millions of people. But precisely to what extent the Indians were receptive of the new religion, what aspects of their own faiths and forms of worship they chose to retain, and for how long are subjects we continue to pursue. Receiving considerable attention are the new and hybrid or syncretic forms of belief that arose and what factors prompted them. 259</page><page sequence="2">260 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS Investigations into the nature of post-Conquest Indian religiosity have often emphasized the role of the clergy, particularly the regular orders, in shaping its dimensions. Questions posed in such studies have dwelt on what the friars sought to accomplish, the methods used to achieve these goals, and their outcome.' Inquiry has also pondered the nature of the interaction of secular priests and the indigenous peoples, as well as the effect of in- creasing secularization on the shape of belief and ritual, especially in rural areas. The implications for evangelism of the late colonial Enlightenment have also received some attention.2 The many scholarly attempts to answer these questions and their related theoretical debates have contributed a great deal to our understanding of religious change following conquest. Yet, all too often the sources upon which they have been based leave something to be desired for getting at the internal and individual Indian experience and perspective. Fortunately, re- search in "new" sources, such as long-neglected colonial manuscripts written by and about central Mexican Indians and in their own language, Nahuatl, can offer exciting new insights into the indigenous perspective. The work of Louise Burkhart and Jorge Klor de Alva, for example, illus- trates some of the ways in which Indians selectively accepted the teachings of Christianity.3 Still other scholars, most notably James Lockhart and his students, are using a wide array of colonial Nahuatl documents to reconstruct the internal and the individual way of life in indigenous communities, including both the material and spiritual.4 Testaments, annals, election records, primordial titles, and bills of sale are just some of the many Indian records available. At times revisionist, and at times complementary, the studies of these new sources are elaborating significantly upon Charles Gibson's monumental work, The Aztecs under Spanish Rule, which was for more than two and a SSee, for example, Hugo Nutini, "Syncretism and Acculturation: The Historical Development of the Cult of the Patron Saint in Tlaxcala, Mexico (1519-1670)," Ethnology 15:3 (July 1976), 301-321, and his discussion of "guided syncretism." 2 See, for example, Serge Gruzinski, "La segunda aculturaci6n: el estado ilustrado y la religiosidad indigena en Nueva Espafia, 1771-1800," Estudios de Historia Novohispana 9 (1985), 175-201. 3 Louise Burkhart, The Slippery Earth: Nahua-Christian Moral Dialogue in Sixteenth-Century Mexico (Tucson: The University of Arizona Press, 1989) and J.

While other books are soon to follow, one of the first histories utilizing Nahuatl sources is S. L. Cline's Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town.6 The fascinating picture Cline paints of indige- nous life in Culhuacan after two generations under colonial rule is based to a large extent upon the sixty-five Nahua testaments she and Miguel Le6n- Portilla published in 1984.7 Like Cline's work, the present study is based on the analysis of Nahuatl testaments, in this case 170 examples from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and coming from Indian towns in the Valley of Toluca. One of the broader aims in using these sources is to assess the degree and nature of change in Indian lives as Cline did, but in this case in the mature to late period, spanning more than two centuries beyond the Culhuacan study." While other cultural, social, and economic details can be gleaned from these later wills, as in Cline's study, the emphasis here will remain with their religious content. A cursory handling of the Tolucan testaments quickly reveals them to be shot through with references to the worship of Catholic saints, information which begs deeper probing into the relation- ships between the indigenous peoples and the religion of the conquerors. Was Christianity becoming more imbedded in people's lives over time? What can we learn about how it was being practiced in Indian homes? The location for this study, the Toluca Valley, complements the Cul- huacan study in yet another way. Energetic settlement by Spanish agricul- turalists experienced a slight delay in Toluca while the more desirable Valley of Mexico was occupied. This decay helped strengthen the nu- merous Indian communities' independence from the eventual intruders, at least to a degree. Indigenous autonomy was less secure here, however, than in the more distant Oaxaca. It was not really until Spanish settlers began flocking to the Toluca Valley, in the first half of the seventeenth century, that the indigenous population started its recuperation from massive epi- 5 Charles Gibson, The Aztecs under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1964). 6 S.

Cline and Miguel Le6n-Portilla, The Testaments of Culhuacan (Los Angeles: UCLA Latin American Center, Nahuatl Studies Series, 1, 1984). 8 The temporal framework for this study is also partly a product of serendipity, for sixteenth-century testaments are rare. The earliest Toluca Valley will in Nahuatl examined here stems from 1623 and the latest from 1801, but most are concentrated in the hundred years between 1675 and 1775, and half date from after 1750. Within the entire span, there are two notable peaks associated with epidemics. Twenty testaments (twelve percent) date from 1737 and forty-five (twenty-six percent) come from 1759-62, years that saw the loss of numerous individuals in the prime of their lives.</page><page sequence="4">262 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS demics. While cultural changes that came with the growing Spanish pres- ence are still being documented, it is known that the indigenous peoples of Toluca encountered substantial contact with the ways of the Spaniards, in both the lay and religious spheres. One of the more obvious and best studied aspects of such contact was especially intense over the second half of the seventeenth and through the eighteenth century when, in Toluca as elsewhere, a struggle over resources developed between and among Spaniards and Indians. It is owing to land litigation, in fact, that many of the Nahuatl testaments from that period have been preserved.9 Presented to the courts as evidence of property ownership, the largest number of Tolucan wills originate from the southern, more fer- tile and traditionally most populous part of the valley. It was also in that region that Nahuatl-not numerically but officially the dominant language of the valley as a whole-was spoken by greater numbers of people. Cali- maya and its paired town, Tepemaxalco, are found in the southern end of the valley; this parish produced a third of the testaments studied here.10 While some testators may not have spoken Nahuatl as their first language, the trained notaries and other Indian church officials who recorded their final wills primarily were literate only in that lingua franca of the central Mexican indigenous world." Additional features of this group of 169 testators (one produced two of the testaments, hence the 170 testaments) merit discussion before moving on to the content of their wills. Their socioeconomic profile would reveal considerable variations in material wealth and status. It is a misconception to think of colonial Indians-even as late as the eighteenth century-as an undifferentiated peasant mass, just as it would be incorrect to assume that 9 Most of these wills are found in the collections of Tierras and Civil in the Archivo General de la Naci6n, Mexico. Pulled out of personal caches for litigation purposes, the origin and context for the majority of testaments is cloudy. Some were apparently written on the testator's deathbed, for a note from the priest will occasionally indicate that a mass was said for the deceased on a date that follows shortly after the will's composition. Others were made possibly months in advance. Most do not indi- cate. Haste would obviously bear upon a testament's contents as will be noted below. 1O There are numerous Nahuatl testaments in the Calimaya parish archives, but the Calimayan wills discussed here come from the national archives. The Calimaya parish holdings were brought to public attention thanks to the work of Margarita Loera y Chivez, Calimaya y Tepemaxalco; tenencia y trans- misirn hereditaria de la tierra en dos comunidades indigenas (dpoca colonial) (Mexico: Departamento de Investigaciones Historicas del Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, 1977), but access is difficult. " Nahuatl speakers first came to dominate the valley with the Aztec conquest of the 1470s, but the region is also known for its Matlatzinca, Mazahua, Otomi, and Ocuilteca peoples. See Peter Gerhard, A Guide to the Historical Geography of New Spain (Cambridge: At the University Press, 1972) and Maria Noemi Quezada Ramirez, Los matlatzincas; dpoca prehispdnica y dpoca colonial hasta 1650 (Mexico: Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Investigaciones, 22, 1972), p. 9.</page><page sequence="5">STEPHANIE WOOD 263 only elite Indians might have left testaments.12 Twenty-four (twenty per cent) of the male testators in this Toluca Valley group bore the honorific, Spanish-introduced title don. This represents probably a higher concentra- tion of men with the title than one would find within a sample of 169 people all from the same town. But, it is significant that eighty percent of the male testators were not dons yet still had enough property or last wishes to war- rant the making of a will.13 While male testators do dominate numerically, it is likewise incorrect to assume that female Indians owned nothing and therefore would have no reason to make wills. Although women were less likely to leave a testament if there were full-grown, wealthy men around, there were plenty who did make a will. Fifty-two of the 169 people in this lot were women. Typical of the stinginess with which the female title equivalent to don was distributed among indigenous women, only one of these fifty-two women was a doia.14 These indigenous women and men, wealthy and poor, of high status and low, all reflect in their testaments an acceptance and sometimes a passion for the faith of the conquerors, Catholicism. Glimpses of the intensity of their devotion and the nature of their worshiping practices come through in many of the wills. Cline found Indian testators of Culhuacan had already "adopted many of the outward forms of Christianity" by 1580.15 In the sixteenth century they already followed the standard Christian requirements of baptism, marriage within the Church, the receipt of last rites, and the making of a final will. Although possibly coming under the influence of notaries, Culhuacan testators usually invoked the assistance of Christian divinities in making their final wills. They also provided that masses be 12 Of course, anyone familiar with Cline's work would not have these misconceptions. 13 Men without the title may still have had some status. The title don had become watered-down over the colonial period, making it more accessible to prominent individuals who were not direct descendants of prehispanic nobles. On the other hand, there were also prominent local families in most communities at any given time which, for various reasons, were not using the title. While the main purpose here is to point out some social differentiation, much more could be done with these sources to explore status. Titled relatives are sometimes mentioned even when the testator has no title. A few testaments list an impressive number of prominent witnesses. Some testators' properties tend to border more often on those of people with titles and/or known wealth. Indications of wealth and career patterns are sometimes evident, too. '4 Frank Saloman's study, "Indian Women of Early Colonial Quito as Seen through Their Testa- ments," the Americas 44 (1988), 325-341, helps compensate for the dearth of research on native women in the colonial period and provides for some telling comparisons with rural life. Even those testatrices he describes as living in poverty, for instance, were well-to-do compared to most Indian villagers or townswomen considered here. 15 Cline, Colonial Culhuacan, p. 14.</page><page sequence="6">264 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS said, candles be lighted on altars, and deceased relatives be remembered. They wanted the trappings of a Christian burial. They encouraged their heirs to participate in celebrations. They gave money to charity. Culhuacan testators helped build and adorn religious houses, and they made bequests of property to their local church. Religious objects, such as crucifixes, were also among their personal possessions in the home.16 Many of the same ostensible expressions of piety that Cline detects in the sixteenth-century Culhuacan testaments are present in the wills from Toluca many years later. But change is also visible. In the evidence to be devel- oped below, we will see that an apparently broader familiarity with and devotion to Christ, Mary, Joseph, and the saints had emerged between the creation of the Culhuacan and the Tolucan testaments. Individuals had be- come ever more active in serving and celebrating the Catholic pantheon, adopting saints into their homes and daily lives. Evidence of this cult of the saints is found in the sometimes lengthy invocations, special altar gifts or offerings, special requests about burials in certain chapels or near altars, the disposition of hundreds of saints' images worshiped in Indian homes, and in the instructions about how the images were to be served in the home, church, and the fields. While these are only outward manifestations of faith, it is hoped that the details of such activities will help us better assess the extent and nature of the religious conversion process that was a major component of Spanish colonialism. INVOCATIONS, GIFTS AND BURIALS The opening statements of the majority of wills in this study provide the first clues of a devotion to the Catholic saints among the testators. The opening clauses typically include an invocation of Mary (seen in eighty- seven testaments) or another saint to intercede on the person's behalf on judgment day and, less frequently, opening clauses contain a special request about the location or nature of the burial or a small gift for a particular altar. Turning first to invocations, it is prudent to remember that they are really only tentative indicators of piety. The presence of an invocation at the start of the testament may be the choice of the notary (albeit an Indian) who wrote the will-following some preconceived formula-rather than the preference of the testator. Invocations may also be influenced by commu- nity tradition as much as individual choice. Similarly, the absence of an invocation must not be interpreted necessarily as a lack of devotion. Sixty- eight wills in this group contain no invocation, which may be owing as '6 Cline, Colonial Culhuacan, pp. 15ff.</page><page sequence="7">STEPHANIE WOOD 265 much to the haste, laziness, or style on the part of the notary as the lack of a desire to call on the saints on the part of the testator. Either or both the testator and the notary may have simply forgotten or been ignorant of this formula.7 Perhaps, too, the inability to pay for an elaborate testament ex- plains the absence of some invocations.18 Despite these qualifications, some rough patterns are visible in the invo- cations that do appear in most wills and their presence should not be over- looked. Mary was far and away the most popular intercessor for keeping one out of purgatory.19 Her popularity seems to have cut across regional and temporal divisions. Invoking "all the saints in heaven" or "of heaven's court" was also quite customary, though possibly formulaic, for it is seen in twenty-six Toluca Valley wills of different periods and places. Some communities had additional favorites, often calling upon their patron saints and/or those of the larger religious sodalities. Wills from Calimaya and Tepemaxalco frequently invoked the patron saints Peter and Paul, plus Mi- chael the Archangel, Anthony of Padua, John the Baptist, Raphael the Archangel, and/or Gabriel the Archangel. Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was a recurring invocation form for Mary, particularly in Cali- maya. A broader knowledge of the saints in this community may be owing to the presence of a monastery there.20 But a few other towns had a discernible tradition of their own. In San Mateo Atenco, testators called on all Christians to pray for them.21 Our Lady of Guadalupe, immensely popular in other forms, is rarely invoked as an intercessor; she is seen in this capacity, however, in two wills from Teotenango (Tenango del Valle).22 In San Mateo Texcaliacac we see the tradition of bequeathing candles for "All the Altars"''-meaning literally all the altars in the church of San Mateo or perhaps one generic altar that represented all the saints.23 In these cases, it may be that testators were being loyal to particular local favorites when they invoked them, or it could be that the notaries of the given communities were responsible for keeping 17 The notaries for these wills exhibited varying degrees of skill. Some seem to have been beginners, others were retirees of high church office. 18 Unfortunately, I do not know what the charge was for having a will drawn up, nor if there were less or more expensive models available. 19 Purgatory is occasionally mentioned (by loanword) in these testaments. See, for example, AGN Tierras 2300:3:9r-1lv (Tepezoyuca, 1737). 20 The particular popularity of invoking saints in Calimaya may also be a distortion stemming from the fact that one-third of the wills studied here came from the Calimaya/Tepemaxalco area. 21 AGN Tierras 2391:1:26r-v (1694), 27r-30 (1780), and 59r-v (1788?). 22 AGN Tierras 2298:3:7r-9r (1762) and 2547:2:7r-8r (1746). 23 AGN Civil 986:2:8r-9v (1762) and O10r-v (1737); 1071:15:4r-7r (1738); 1083:12:1r-4r (1732) and 8r-10v (1772); Tierras 2303:4:26r-30v (1762); and, 2538:6:1r-2r (1737) and 13r-14r (1775).</page><page sequence="8">266 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS traditions alive. Except for possibly compulsory donations for Jerusalem and the like, offerings for specific altars, on the other hand, may be more certain indicators of the testators' individual wishes, as they seem to have been given willingly. Gifts left to special saints' images or altars tended to take the form of candles above all else, conveying something of the testators' worshiping practices and individual preference. People might designate one, two, or four reales (eighths of pesos) for candles, or not specify any particular amount. The varying amounts may argue against an expected donation. Seemingly larger quantities are also known. One rather wealthy person left a pound of candles for Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception suggesting a personal devotion to Mary.24 Another designated that a pound of candle wax be given annually to the local church.25 Residents of San Pedro Techu- chulco apparently either felt compelled or especially passionate about leaving candles for the altars of patron saints Peter and Paul, because testa- ments from that community never omitted this gift.26 Testators of San Mateo Texcaliacac also rather regularly honored their town's patron in this way and left cash (presumably for candles or incense) for the altar of the Most Holy Sacrament.27 These last two examples suggest less individual volition and more a dutiful response to community tradition. Still, enthu- siasm among individuals and groups alike for such traditions need not be dismissed. Cash offerings were fairly common-possibly surprising given that these testators were largely self-sufficient farmers-but offerings did tend to be small, one or two reales (eighths of pesos). Again, the variation runs counter to the existence of a set donation required by the church and sup- ports the operation of individual will in these cases. The largest cash of- fering in this group reached four pesos, put forth to provide masses for an image of Mary in a calvario (shrine on a hill) in Tenango del Valle in 24 AGN Tierras 2533:2:31r-v (1696). This seems like a large quantity, but it would depend on the number of candles that could be made from a pound. Each candle cost one real in Zinacantepec in the mid-eighteenth century; BNM/FR (Biblioteca Nacional de M6xico, Fondo Reservado or Caja Fuerte), Fondo Franciscano 108:1491, 9:64r. Four candles per pound of wax was a ratio known in colonial Michoacin; see Ernesto de la Torre Villar, "Algunos aspectos acerca de las cofradfas y la propiedad territorial en Michoacan," Jahrbuch fur Geschichte von Staat, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft Lateina- merikas, 4(1967), 428. Thus, a pound could have fallen within the norm of one to four reales. 25 AGN Civil 664:2:55r (Santa Maria Nativitas, 1737). 26 AGN Tierras 2615:1:1r-3v (1762), 10r-12v (1726), 7:1r-v, 3r-4v (1727), 5r-6r, 2r-v (1727), and, 12r-v, 14r-v (1726). 27 AGN Civil 986:2:8r-9v (1762) and 10r-v (1737); 1071:15:4r-7r (1738); 1083:12:1r-4r (1732) and 8r-O10v (1772); Tierras 2303:4:26r-30v (1762); and, 2538:6:lr-2r (1737) and 13r-14r (1775).</page><page sequence="9">STEPHANIE WOOD 267 1719.28 A new development in this group of testaments, compared to wills of earlier times, is the reduced evidence of people ordering goods or land to be sold in order to raise these cash offerings or ecclesiastical fees.29 This may suggest that small amounts of cash were more readily available than they had been in the sixteenth century. It could also be, but seems less likely, that sales were expected and therefore not mentioned. The most unique gift in the whole group of testaments, and not a cash one, was the donation of some musical instruments (chirimias) for Guada- lupe. Presumably, someone would play the instruments at annual fiestas for this image of the Virgin, a practice that was not in itself unusual.30 Gifts or offerings to various churches and particular saints' altars, after an apparent increase in volume over the seventeenth century, tended to be- come fewer in the second half of the eighteenth. Whereas this entire sam- pling of wills from the Toluca Valley is broken in half, numerically, at about 1750, wills stipulating gifts show a sixty-two percent concentration before 1750. For testaments in the sample dating after 1775, furthermore, not a single one includes an offering outside of the mandatory donation for Jerusalem.31 One wonders whether this was an indication of the growing competition over resources in the late colonial period, or a declining religi- osity, or some fallout from tightening controls on Indian religious practices during the Enlightenment.32 The ultimate destination for many of the gifts, from candles to cash to musical instruments, may have been the local cofradias (religious soda- lities) which maintained the particular altar or celebrated a given saint or saints' feast days. Cofradias represented an important avenue by which In- dians could play an active role in church festivities. Cofradias became vis- ible across central Mexico in the seventeenth century, although at that time 28 AGN Tierras 2535:4: 1r-2v. The ubiquitous half real for Jerusalem should not necessarily be taken as a pious bequest; it was built into the charge for burial in, for example, San Mateo Atenco in 1721 (MNAH/AH [Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Archivo Hist6rico)], Fondo Franciscano 51:4r). 29 On the prevalence of sales in sixteenth-century testaments see Cline, Colonial Culhuacan, pp. 26, 84. o30 AGN Tierras 2533:5:1r-4r (Tepemaxalco, 1691). A chirimia is a loud quacking instrument with a single reed. 31 Of the twenty-nine wills that include gifts, eighteen date from before 1750 and eleven from 1750 or later, showing a decline of twenty-four percent. 32 That the Enlightened Church was redirecting their energies is another possible explanation. See Serge Gruzinski, Man-Gods in the Mexican Highlands: Indian Power and Colonial Society, 1520-1800 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1989), pp. 112-113. I have some doubts, however, that the clergy could curb the people's enthusiasm for established forms of saint worship so easily.</page><page sequence="10">268 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS they were still more numerous on the periphery.33 The Most Holy Sacra- ment, for which there are a total of twelve offerings in these wills, was the devotion of cofradias in Metepec, Calimaya, San Mateo Atenco, Zinacan- tepec, and probably several other towns.34 Unfortunately, the cofradia con- nection is not spelled out by the testators. Burials, similarly, are known to have fallen partly under the domain of cofradias. When testators indicate a desire in their final wills to be buried in a particular church, chapel, or near a favorite altar, all but one fail to indi- cate if this was expected by virtue of their membership in a cofradia. A cofradia connection is suggested strongly by the cases of the three men in Calimaya/Tepemaxalco who expressed a desire to be buried near St. An- thony: one of the four cofradfas in Calimaya as of 1721 was devoted to this saint.35 But a similar relationship cannot be verified for the two women in the same vicinity who asked to be laid to rest near Our Lady of the Purifica- tion.36 Two testators of Capulhuac and Tlamimilolpan, Calimaya, wanted to be buried near the Santo Entierro (The Entombment, or Christ in the Sepulcher). While evidence of cofradfas bearing this name has yet to be found for the two communities in question, Zinacantepec had a Santo En- tierro cofradfa, and the name was popular for religious sodalities in other communities, too.37 The other seventeen testators who specify a special burial location do not duplicate each other. Having a larger sample of wills for every town, such as we have for Calimaya, however, might allow us to see repetitions in other communities and point to additional possible co- fradias. The lack of immediate duplication in many of the burial requests may 33 John K. Chance and William B. Taylor, "Cofradias and Cargos: An Historical Perspective on the Mesoamerican Civil-Religious Hierarchy," American Ethnologist 12 (1985), 8. James Lockhart, in a personal communication, pointed out the apparently greater number of cofradfas on the periphery of the central areas. 34 Cofradfas by this name are found in: MNAH/AH Fondo Franciscano 48:21r (Metepec), 180:4r (Calimaya), 51:3v (Atenco), and 144:42v (Zinacantepec). The four wills not mentioned above (with those from Texcaliacac) that left offerings for the Santisimo Sacramento are in: AGN Civil 1003:4:23r- 24r, 28r-v (Tianguistengo, 1737?) and 30r-32v (Tianguistengo, 1761); Tierras 2300:18:19r-20v (Tepe- maxalco, 1714); and, 2533:5:1r-4r (Tepemaxalco, 1691). 35 AGN Civil 1495:10:2r-5v (1762); Tierras 2298:5:21r-22v (1755); and, 2533:5:lr-4r (1691). The cofradia of this name is seen in MNAH/AH Fondo Franciscano 48:21r. 36 AGN Civil 664:2:68r-v (1759) and NL/A (Newberry Library, Ayer Collection) 1477 B (2) (1739).

I subsequently made my own transcriptions, so any errors are also my own.) 37 Santo Entierro is seen as a cofradia of Zinacantepec in MNAH/AH Fondo Franciscano 144:42v.

The desire to be buried near a favorite saint may have been overruled by a person's lack of money or sufficiently high status to warrant such a privilege, requiring instead that his or her body be interred in the cemetery.38 There is some evidence in the wills to suggest that status or wealth was associated with burial inside the church: three (representing thirteen percent) of the twenty-three testators (in turn, thirteen percent of the whole group) expressing such a wish bore the honorific title don. Inci- dentally, thirteen of the twenty-three testators with a burial request were men and ten were women, suggesting that both sexes might seek and obtain a resting place associated with a favorite saint.39 Thus socioeconomic status but not gender, seems to have influenced an individual's relationship with the church in at least this regard. Women and men alike also made the occasional request to be buried in a certain garment. The Franciscan shroud was the object of thirteen men (four were dons) and two women, from a variety of towns and decades.40 The shroud of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (representative of the Carmelite Order?) was sought by ten testators, all women and all but one from Calimaya.41 People of both genders and many times and places (but still from this some- what restricted socioeconomic group) sought the Franciscan cord presum- ably a tie for either the Franciscan or Carmelite shroud, but something not 38 Cline (Colonial Culhuacan, p. 24) discusses the European tradition of church burial among the wealthy. 39 The three dons are found in AGN Civil 1495:10:2r-5v (Calimaya, 1762); Tierras 2533:5:1r-4r (Tepemaxalco, 1691); and, 2539:12:5r-8r (San Bartolom6 Aticpac, 1632).

These requests were not auto- matic for all elite members of the community, and the choice of specific altars or garments indicates some partiality for them. Furthermore, because the majority of requests for burial near a particular saint's altar are not duplicated, and a clear cofradia connection cannot be sustained for them, this may indicate individual preference was operating at least part of the time. OBJECTS OF WORSHIP IN THE HOME Far and away the best indicator in the testaments of a devotion to the Catholic saints is the ubiquitous presence of their images as objects of wor- ship in Indian homes. Over one hundred wills (sixty-three percent) in this group mention owning some religious object. In the main, these objects were small oil paintings on wood, prints, and/or, probably less frequently, carved wooden or stone statuettes known in Spanish as imagenes de bulto or images in the round. Also seen in this collection, although rarely, are paintings of the saints on canvas, known as lienzos. Two testators mention lienzos; one had three and the other had one.43 Crucifixes, popular in the sixteenth century, were either fewer in number in later times or were deemed not worth mentioning, for only four testators owned crucifixes in this group of wills from the Toluca Valley.44 It may also be that crucifixes came to be equated with images of Christ, which, as will be seen below, were very popular.45 42 Franciscan cord requests are located in: NL/A 1477 B (1) (Calimaya, 1773) and (2) (Calimaya, 1739); AGN Civil 664:2:34r-35r (Calimaya, 1763), 40r (Calimaya, 1760), and 52r-v (Calimaya, 1759); 1207:11:4r-7v (San Miguel Totocuitlapilco, 1652); 1495:10:2r-5v (Calimaya, 1762); Hospital de Jests, leg. 326:1:1r-3v (Toluca, 1717) and 13:21r (Toluca, 1671); Tierras 1501:3:3r-4v (Tepemaxalco, 1710); 2298:5:17r-20r (Calimaya, 1734), 21r-22v (Calimaya, 1755), and 32r-37v (Calimaya, 1712); 2300:18:17r-18v (Tepemaxalco, 1654); 2303:1:10r-llv (Tepemaxalco, 1762) and 42r-43v (Tepemax- alco, 1695); 2533:5:1r-4r (Tepemaxalco, 1691); and, 2536:7:1r (Capulhuac, 1692).

He also cites William A. Christian, Jr.'s discussion of the "Christo- centric nature of late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish devotion."

A person did not have to be wealthy to possess an image; landless people with no other possessions occasionally had one or more icons.46 Whether individuals sometimes made the images or always bought or commissioned them is not clear. We know that image-making became a folk art in New Mexico in the second half of the eighteenth century, but that may have come of necessity as images were costly to obtain from central Mexico.47 Of course, cost may have been a factor encouraging even central Mexican Indians, if humble, to make their own images. The only price for an image that emerges in one of the wills is six pesos.48 If a day's labor for a farm hand in the valley brought in one- to two-eighths of a peso over most of the period under investigation, then an image going for six pesos would require four to eight weeks' pay, a substantial outlay.49 Painting one's own image or commissioning it from a local, untrained artist may have been more economical than purchasing one in, say, the capital. While a few apparently poor individuals did possess one or more saints' images, poverty and/or the inability to make their own may have kept some of the sixty-two testators (thirty-seven percent of the whole) who failed to mention any images from acquiring one for their home altars. A group of approximately forty wills from the Calimaya/Tepemaxalco region and dating from the epidemic of the late 1750s and early 1760s, contains rela- tively few saints' images or other possessions, for that matter. Most of the testators behind these wills were either very poor and may not have even had a testament drawn up if the circumstances were different, or else their testaments were made with such haste that there was little time to spell out any but the most important possessions and designate the principal heirs. Some testators who mention no religious objects among their possessions 46 See, for example, AGN Civil 664:2:52r-v (Calimaya, 1759) and Tierras 2536:7:1r (Capulhuac, 1692). 47 Jos6 E. Espinosa, Saints in the Valleys: Christian Sacred Images in the History, Life and Folk Art of Spanish New Mexico (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1967), chapter 3. In Tlaxcala, according to Hugo Nutini in Todos Santos in Rural Tlaxcala: A Syncretic, Expressive, and Symbolic Analysis of the Cult of the Dead (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988), p. 179, most "religious oils and polychrome statues were commissioned by the Indians or bought directly from several santeros [saint makers] in the city." Among the Sierra Otomi today, saints' images are thought to have been bought in church shops during pilgrimages or were ordered from woodcarvers.

Six reales was also the price for a painting of Christ made by an Indian as seen in Gruzinski, Man-Gods, p. 106. 49 Stephanie Wood, "Corporate Adjustments in Colonial Mexican Indian Towns: Toluca Region, 1550-1810," (Los Angeles: Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California, 1984), p. 247.</page><page sequence="14">272 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS did own a fair amount of land and some bore the honorific title don before their names, leading one to believe they may have had the ability (unless they were land rich and cash poor) but not the desire to possess saints' images.50 Another explanation for some of the sixty-two testators who fail to mention religious statuary or paintings may be that they took it for granted that whoever inherited their house would take care of their images, and they did not feel the need to mention them. Of course, those who do provide detailed instructions about "their" saints appear more devoted than those who mention the images only in passing or may have ignored them altogether. Except in such cases, piety cannot be measured with complete certainty by the presence, absence, or even the number of images an individual held. A wealthy don who owned eight objects may have been no more devoted to them than the poor woman who possessed only one. An otherwise materi- ally poor man who bequeathed six images to various heirs may have inher- ited those himself, and may have cared for them and passed them on only out of some sense of duty to deceased relatives rather than out of a passion for serving the saints. Such is anyone's guess. Nonetheless, other indi- cators, some of which will be explored farther below, arise which do help substantiate the indigenous people's attachment to the saints and illustrate the nature of their worship. One factor that can be quantified with regard to the ownership of reli- gious objects, for example, is the popularity of particular saints. Sustaining our conception of the Virgin of Guadalupe as the patron saint of Mexico, her image takes a clear lead as the most popular religious object owned by these testators, with twenty-four examples appearing in the wills."5 The second favorite was Santo Cristo, with seventeen images, followed by Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception (thirteen), St. Anthony (twelve), St. Francis (nine), St. Nicholas (seven), St. James, St. John, and St. Michael (with six each). Other saints rated five or fewer examples, although none of the positions should be considered steadfast, for thirty-seven testators who specifically mentioned owning some saints' images did not specify who those images represented. Another aspect of image ownership that can be quantified with some success is the change over time in the number of testators who possessed 50 See, for example, AGN Civil 1643:18:1r-2v (Capulhuac, 1727) and Tierras 2547:14:5r-6r (Ten- ango del Valle, 1740). 51 Sixteen men (three dons) and eight women testators mention these images. Two of these references date from the seventeenth century (the earliest from 1632), but most are from the 1730s or later. No particular geographical pattern is apparent. See Table 1.</page><page sequence="15">STEPHANIE WOOD 273 these figures on their home altars. The most striking change is first seen in the appearance of such possessions in seventeenth-century wills when they had barely existed in the preceding century. S. L. Cline apparently found only four crucifixes, no other images, and no lienzos among her Culhuacan testators.52 By the late seventeenth century, when the existing testaments from the Toluca Valley pick up in number, however, the ownership of pri- vate images is almost expected-except perhaps among the very poorest people. Then, after a strong showing in the first half of the eighteenth century, two independent indicators point to a slight decline in the number of people who owned religious objects over the next five decades. The number of wills mentioning images is sixteen percent higher before 1750 than the number with them after. The number of wills that do not mention any reli- gious objects is also sixteen percent higher after the same point in time.53 This change was not radical and a certain margin of error is built in owing to the casual way these objects were treated in many testaments, but the tendency for fewer people to possess saints' images over time would corre- spond to the abovementioned decrease in altar offerings and a reduction in land worked for saints that will be addressed below. Incidentally, among those testators who had their own representations of the saints, the average number they possessed-three or four-stayed about the same over time.54 Regional variations in the ownership of certain saints' images are also apparent, although tentative. There are a few cases where the duplication of a certain saint's representation is found in wills from the same town. The only two images of St. Augustine mentioned in the group of wills, for example, were owned by testators of San Francisco Xonacatlan.55 Three of the five representations of Jestis Nazareno, or The Man of Sorrows, were among the possessions of people living in San Mateo Texcaliacac.56 St. Peter is represented by four images in the testaments; Tepemaxalco wills 52 Cline, Colonial Culhuacan, p. 28. The crucifixes, again, may have been transitional in the devel- opment of a passion for saints' images. In the sixteenth-century wills Cline also found Christian texts and rosaries, items that do not appear in these Toluca Valley wills. The differences between the two groups of testaments may also be regional, although there are no certain indicators of this yet. 53 Fifty-nine wills dating from before 1750 mention owning religious objects, while forty-two do the same after 1750. Thirty-six testaments dating from after 1750 do not mention owning any images, while twenty-six other wills fit this category before that year. 54 The range was zero to fourteen religious objects per testament, with high numbers not corre- sponding to any particular periods in time. 55 AGN Tierras 2301:4:1r-4v (1737) and 28r-29r (1728). 56 AGN Civil 1083:12:1r-4r (1732) and 8r-10v (1772); and, Tierras 2538:6:13r-14r (1775). A co- fradia dedicated to Jesuis Nazareno, or The Man of Sorrows, is known for Calimaya (MNAH/AH Fondo Franciscano 48:21r); there may have been one, too, in Texcaliacac.</page><page sequence="16">274 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS account for three of these.57 St. Peter was one of the two patrons of Cali- maya/Tepemaxalco, but the popularity of St. Augustine in Xonacatlan and The Man of Sorrows in Texcaliacac, if not merely coincidental, cannot be explained without further research. Cofradias dedicated to these particular saints may be at the root of such recurring images. There are a few examples suggesting local participation in a regionwide cult devoted to the Sefior (or Santo Cristo) de Chalma, which thrives still today in Mexico, drawing pilgrims from at least as far away as the Huas- teca. Representations of this particular, dark-skinned Christ are mentioned in three testaments from the Toluca Valley. His presence there is not sur- prising, since Chalma, the site of his shrine, is located just beyond the southern end of the valley. Christ's image and that of the warrior archangel, St. Michael, either appeared miraculously or were placed in a cave at Chalma by Augustinian friars in the 1530s when they simultaneously re- moved a prehispanic idol commonly associated with Huitzilopochtli.58 In one of the three wills illustrating the local cult, Francisco Juan of Tlamimilolpan, Calimaya, left his son Juan Francisco in 1712 images of Guadalupe and the Sefior de Chalma, to be served with incense and candles. Furthermore, all of his children were obliged to work a piece of land, holding a half fanega of maize seed, to pay for the annual mass for the Sefior de Chalma.59 In another case, dating from 1724, candles and flowers were to come from the proceeds of land worked in Santa Cruz Atizapan by don Bernardo Hernmindez's nephew for the images of the Santo Cristo de Chalma, Our Lady of Sorrows, and St. Bernard. To help him in this en- deavor, the nephew also received two hatchets and a yoke of oxen.6 In yet a third town, near Amanalco, in 1762, a Josef Antonio left his house and solar to his son Pascual Josef so that he would serve the "Divine Savior, the Holy Christ of Chalma." 61 Although some people may have worshiped Huitzilopochtli behind the Chalma images of Christ or St. Michael, there is nothing in these few ex- amples that offers any support for such a contention, plausible though it may be. Nothing here is said of the cyclical pilgrimages, either, but we do 57 AGN Tierras 1501:3:3r-4v (Tepemaxalco, 1710) and 15r, 16r-v (Tepemaxalco, 1693); 2391:1:59r- v (Atenco, 1788?); and, 2533:5:1r-4r (Tepemaxalco, 1691). 58 See, for example, Erna Fergusson, Fiesta in Mexico (New York, 1934), pp. 47-67, and Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest, pp. 192, 193, 269-70.

One wonders whether the latter may have been the souvenirs of past pilgrimages to the cave. Pilgrimages to Chalma today are second in number only to those destined for Tepeyac (or Tepeyacac), the site of the apparition of the Virgin of Gua- dalupe, outside Mexico City. We might presume that Indians of the Valley of Toluca sometimes made this religious trek, but, again, the testaments are not a source of information of this nature. Guadalupe's cult was certainly celebrated-in many homes and towns and over the entire period covered by these wills. As noted earlier, her image was the most popular of all images mentioned in the wills. She was also depicted on one of the four lienzos mentioned. In Tenango, testators invoked her over the more stan- dard Mary. There was a barrio named for Guadalupe in San Mateo Atengo, and in Cuaxustenco, Atizapan, Tianguistengo, Texcaliacac, and Capulhuac testators' land and century plants were dedicated to her, presumably with the proceeds paying for fiestas in her honor. Because of the great interest in indigenous participation and the timing of the Guadalupe cult, these ex- amples are detailed in Table 1.63 TABLE I EXAMPLES OF DEVOTION TO THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE EXTRACTED FROM NAHUATL WILLS, TOLUCA REGION, COLONIAL PERIOD Images of Guadalupe 1632 S.

Some readers might expect to find that women were more involved in the cult of the saints. Observers in Mexico have tended to view women as more interested in the Church than were men, reporting even as early as 1556, for example, that women's church atten- dance was more noticeable.64 But, when ownership and inheritance patterns are examined, men emerge as the more numerous owners of images, and images are bequeathed to male relatives more often than to female relatives. Men would also reach farther out to distant relatives who were male (perhaps partly because they were male) if immediate offspring (male or female) ware not in the picture.

Although the Virgin Mary was the most popular, there were few other females that at- tracted much attention. Mary Magdalene and Ann were two of the minor female figures, represented by three or more images.66 But the list of male saints for which three or more images are found includes eleven names.67 A fine thread may be followed between the dominance of males in owning and bequeathing saints and the large array of male saints to choose from, for as we will see below, many individuals had a very personal connection with the saints they served. SAINTS' IMAGES AND FAMILY NAMING PRACTICES We have long had suspicions that a town's patron saint would have many little namesakes among the community's children, and examples of this naming pattern occur in the Tolucan testaments. But there is an even stronger pattern emerging in the wills that children were named after partic- ular saints of devotion on the family altar, and these were frequently not the same as their town's patron. Even though images of the Virgin Mary were among the most popular of all objects of worship and Maria was the most popular name for daughters, examples of such relationships might seem coincidental.68 But, fortunately, the ties often are more striking. For in- stance, the only image of St. Vincent Ferrer that appears in the 170 wills surveyed is possessed by a man named don Vicente Juan of Santa Cruz Atizapan.69 The only image of St. Ignatius is bequeathed to a son named Ignacio in Tepemaxalco in 1691.70 One of the two images of St. Cajetan 65 Due to the nature of the data base, the number of wills was easier to count than the absolute number of individuals. Wills are not totalled, either, because there was some overlap, with a father leaving images to both sons and daughters, for example. 66 Wills with images of Mary Magdalene: AGN Civil 1108:7:16r-17v (Metepec, 1767), and Tierras 2298:5:17r-20v (Calimaya, 1734) and 21r-22v (Calimaya, 1755). St. Ann: AGN Tierras 2300:18:19r- 20v (Tepemaxalco?, 1714); 2539:5:17r-19v (Almoloya, 1762); and, 2544:12, cuad 2:1r-2v, 5r-6v (San- tiago Cuaxustenco, 1736). 67 These eleven are: Santo Cristo, San Antonio, San Francisco, San Nicolis, San Diego, San Juan, San Miguel, San Pedro, San Mateo, San Josef, and San Lucas. In the sacred precincts of Tlaxcalan Indian homes today, Hugo Nutini (Todos Santos, p. 193) notes that "male saints by far outnumber female saints but this imbalance is somewhat compensated for by the large number of manifestations of the Virgin Mary." 68 I have yet actually to quantify the testators' daughters' names, but among the female testators themselves, twenty-nine (fifty-six percent) of the fifty-two women had Maria as a first or second name. 9 AGN Tierras 2301:13:lr-4r (1755). 70 AGN Tierras 2533:5:1r-4r.</page><page sequence="21">STEPHANIE WOOD 279 that appear in the whole group of testaments is inherited by a son named Mariano Cayeteno in Teotenango in 1762. His only brother, incidentally, was named Paulino Cayetano, revealing the parents' particular fondness for the name (and saint) Cayetano.7' In all, there are twenty-four clear ex- amples (not counting Marfas and Virgins) of a name shared between one of the family members and one of the images worshiped in the homes repre- sented by the testaments.72 Many times, as the wills show, images that were passed on to offspring in the testaments share both a parent's and a child's name, possibly having originated with the grandparents' generation or earlier. For example, don Juan de la Cruz mentioned in his testament of 1691 that he wanted his daughter Juana to have his image of St. John. This saint may have been a favorite of his parents, for he also had a sister named Juana. (Interestingly the feminization of the name does not appear to have been unusual.)73 An Isidro Juan of Xonacatlan named one of his sons Juan Isidro (the reverse of his own name) and counted among the possessions he was leaving his chil- dren in 1705 the images of St. Isidore and St. John.74 Similarly, a Francisco Juan of Tlamimilolpan had a child called Juan Francisco. He, too, was bequeathing images that included a St. Francis and St. John, whose names both he and this son shared.75 The namesake of a particular, favorite saint in a given family did not always inherit that saint's image. The corresponding image sometimes went to a sibling with a different name entirely. But there are a sufficient number of examples where the namesake did receive the corresponding image to suggest that the image became a kind of personal guardian to that indi- vidual. Alternately that individual would be destined or expected to serve his or her patron. Children may have been named for a deceased relative as much for the saint who shared both their names.

Individuals of subsequent generations would then continue to carry on the name and the duty of caring for the image. SERVING THE SAINTS Inherited with a saint's image, whether or not that saint was a personal guardian, was a serious obligation to serve that object, or rather, the divine being it represented. The first component of that obligation was often to ensure the image a permanent and sacred place in the home. Testators typi- cally included mention of their saints' images in the same breath that they spoke of their homes and house land (solar, or, borrowed by Nahuatl, xolar, xolal), as though the three formed a special bond: "ynin calzintli yhuan santozinzin yhuan solar nicahuilia nosobrino" ("this house and saints and house land I leave to my nephew").77 The formula was to have the children or spouse serve the saints in the house with the proceeds from the solar, which was usually farmed. Although houses are rarely described, one presumes they usually contained an altar or sacred place (shelf, table) for the images.78 Some testators seem to have looked upon their images as people who shared the house with them. One, for instance, refers to his "santos chane- catzitzin" (the Spanish translator giving: "los santos de mi casa" or "the saints of my house").79 Another family lived with "Padre Bartolom6" (i.e. the image of Nuestro Padre Santo San Bartolom6, the local patron saint).s80 In some testaments an effort was made to keep the images with the house, presumably to ensure that they did not stray as a result of religious proces- sions or loans to the church or to relatives. Apparently, the mobility of the images was not uncommon, but was sometimes a cause of concern. One 76 The document, originally published by Fray Francisco Ximrnez is quoted in both Robert M.

Such structures typi- cally adjoined the cluster of rooms or small buildings that made up the indigenous home, or they might be found on some other part of the solar. Oratories were popular with Spanish settlers, too, but their popularity with Indians may have been owing in part to some continuity in prehispanic traditions of worship. Although possibly referring to neighborhood chapels, rather than private oratories, the Junta Eclesiastica of 1539 expressed some concern about "a survival of polytheism in the multitude of little chapels erected by the Indians, just like those they had once had for their particular gods."83 In the original Nahuatl versions of the wills, the loanword oratorio is most commonly used to describe the separate housing for the saints' images. The recurring presence of "oratorio" would suggest that this form of worship was borrowed, for loanwords typically entered Nahuatl when a neat equivalent was lacking. But the possibility of a resurgent pre-Conquest tradition of worship is held open by the appearance of indigenous terms such as teopan (temple), or ychan (his/her [the saint's] home), or ycaltzin (his/her house) for an oratory or chapel in the Indian household.84 A rare sentence defining "oratorio" is found in the testament of Andr6s Nicolis of Santa Barbara Mixcoac, Toluca, from 1671. It reads: "Noratorio yn itlazo- mahuizcaltzin tto dios za cemicac ychatzinco yez." ("My oratory, which is the precious, marvelous house of our lord God, will be his home for- ever.")85 It is impossible to say whether the recognition for divinity behind the place of worship was either prehispanic or introduced for it was present in both indigenous and European cultures. Besides maintaining a sacred place for the saints' images, the heirs of these Toluca Valley testators were ordered to "serve" or "work for" them. 81 AGN Tierras 2616:3:2r-v (Tianguistengo, 1718). 82 AGN Tierras 2303:4:26r-30v (Texcaliacac, 1762). 83 Quoted by Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest, p. 269, " See, for example, AGN Hospital de Jesis, leg. 326:1:1r-3v (Toluca, 1717); Tierras 2301:4:l1r-4v (Xonacatlan, 1737); 2539:12:5r-8r (San Bartolom6 Aticpac, 1632); 2540:5:3r-4r (Tenango del Valle, 1732); and, 2541:12:1r-3v (Tenango del Valle, 1737).

In twenty-four testaments, the nature of this service is left ambiguous, with no further explanation. Fortunately, some testators were more specific about what was required of the heir(s) who inherited their precious paintings and figurines. To provide candles for the altar is a command in twenty-nine wills, flowers a command in twenty-five, and incense in twenty.86 The three often went together, in fact, but candles or candles and flowers alone were sufficient in some cases. Candles, being a European introduction to the New World, are indicated in the Nahuatl texts by the loanwords candelas or (more rarely) velas. Flowers, on the other hand, are uniformly described with the indigenous term xochitl, translated by the interpreters as flores or rosas. Incense, present in both indigenous and Catholic forms of worship, appears in the Nahuatl, appropriately, as popochtli or copalli. A fourth command detailing the expected service an heir should provide the saints' images was to sweep (apparently, the area around the altar). The use, again, of an indigenous term here (tlachpanaliztli, sweeping) suggests an ancient tradition continuing or reviving in a somewhat changed form. This suggestion is upheld by Fray Diego Durin's observation that prehi- spanic rituals associated with the Feast of Sweeping were "performed in the presence of the saints' images [in sixteenth-century churches] and at the little altars set up in the homes with offerings of food, incense, candles, as if they had been idols!"87 Sweeping around home altars and in the church 86 Service with candles: AGN Civil 664:2:61r-61bis.r (Santa Maria Asunci6n, 1762); 66r-66bis.r (Ca- limaya, 1692); 1003:4:23r-24r (Tianguistengo, 1737?); 1083:12:lr-4r (Texcaliacac, 1732); Tierras 2232:13:12r-v (James Lockhart transcription) (Atenco, 1738); 2298:5:32r-37v (Calimaya, 1712); 2300:2:1r-2v (Xilocingo, 1683); 2301:4:1r-4v (Xonacatlan, 1737) and 28r-29r (Xonacatlan, 1728); 2303:1:10r-1lv (Tepemaxalco, 1762); 2391:1:1r-2v (Atenco, 1694), 27r-30r (Atenco, 1780), and 59r-v (Atenco, 1788?); 2535:16:5r-v (Mexicaltzingo, 1774); 2538:8:1r-2v (Chapultepec, 1773); 2539:5:17r- 19v (Almoloya, 1762); 2541:9:33r-34r (Tepemaxalco, 1735); 2544:12, cuad 2:1r-2v, 5r-6v (Santiago Cuaxustenco, 1736); 2546:8:1r-2v (Xilocingo, 1763), 16:8r-10v (Xonacatlan, 1720) and 22r-v (Xona- catlan, 1733); 2547:3:3r-7r (Tianguistengo, 1737), 7:1r-2v (Atizapan, 1762), 4r-6v (Atizapan, 1724), and 1 lr-v, 13r-v (Atizapan, 1716); 2615:4:1r-3v (Xonacatlan, 1693), 6r-7r (Xonacatlan, 1705), and 5: lr-3r (Chapultepec, 1782); and, 2616:7:9r-10v (Calimaya, 1724).

The dates for these wills stretch from 1693 to 1788, and their geographical spread is fairly wide. However, five of the twelve testaments that mention sweeping come from one town, San Francisco Xonacatlan, which may in- dicate either that the tradition was particularly strong there or Xonacatlan notaries happened to maintain the formula more consistently." Sweeping had so much significance for some individuals, however, that we can see it was far more than a formulaic reminder. The act of sweeping was so im- portant to one testator that he not only asked his wife and children to sweep, but requested that his brothers "yell at them to sweep" ("quintzatzilia tlax- panalistli"). Another testator reminded his heirs twice about sweeping.91 Serving the saints also included, in some wills, seeing to it that masses be said in their honor. These were not masses demanded by ecclesiastics; they were to be said for images owned or held privately. An image of Our Lady of the Assumption, for example, was bequeathed with the requirement of being provided flowers, candles, and a misa cantada (sung mass).92Another testator left her daughter a twenty-quahuitl (twenty-rod) field to be worked for the annual mass, flowers, and candles for the image of St. Ann that the testator was leaving her daughter.93 As noted above, one family had to work a parcel holding one-half fanega of maize seed for the annual mass of the Sefior de Chalma.94 Three other testaments that specify masses do not make it clear if these were to be said in honor of saints whose images were kept in the home or in the local church. These wills do, however, also specify that land be worked for this purpose, a practice that deserves some more de- tailed attention below. 88 See, for example, Ruben E. Reina, The Law of the Saints (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1966), pp. 102, 106. 89 See Christian, Local Religion, p. 157.

Over fifty of the 170 testaments analyzed so far from the Toluca Valley required heirs to cultivate maize or century plants and put yokes of oxen, and, in one will, hatchets to work for the saints. The proceeds went not only for masses and altar embellishments (candles, flowers, etc.), but might have contributed to other expenses incurred on feast days. The com- mitment of a specific parcel from among the family's holdings to provide masses every year is reminiscent of the Spanish practice of capellania, whereby land was not alienated to the church but remained under family control although its proceeds helped provide income for a priest (often a family member).95 In Indian practice, the priest was not the first object of concern but rather the saints. Landholdings within these families were composed of one or more scat- tered parcels of varying sizes. A few of the parcels were said to be pur- chases (tlacohualli), but the vast majority appear to have been usufruct plots that came from the corporate holdings of the town.96 Being passed down over generations within a family, however, all of the parcels seem to have been treated something like private property. Any one, not just those purchased, was apparently available at the whim of the testator to be desig- nated for the support of a given saint. Others were inherited by the testator, already bearing the commitment, and would be passed on to the next gener- ation with the same requirement. Any or all might be divided into smaller parcels between multiple heirs, or be designated to be shared. Finally as noted, not necessarily the land but the plants cultivated on it might sustain the saints. A woman in Tepemaxalco in 1710, for example, left two ma- gueyes each for St. Anthony and The Man of Sorrows."97 Some testators initiated a religious attachment on a given parcel by either leaving it to an heir to be worked for a saint or leaving it seemingly directly to the image. Our Lady of Guadalupe was given thirty agricultural rows or mounds (one of several ways of measuring land in the Toluca Valley, called cuemitl in Nahuatl, translated as surcos or camellones in Spanish) to form 95 James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 15. 9 An example of tlacohualli, something purchased, is seen in AGN Civil 1495:10:2r-5v (Calimaya, 1762). 97 AGN Tierras 1501:3:3r-4v.

Even in these cases of seemingly direct trans- mission to the saints, clearly, relatives or other designees of the testator would have to work the land. Other testators mentioned land that already pertained to a certain saint. After bequeathing his house land and two fields (milli) to a son and nephew, testator Josef Matias then stated that "this land is the property of the saint St. Michael" ("yni tlali yaxcatzin Sto. Sn. Miguel).1o1 Another will typi- cally mentions "the field of St. John" ("San Juan ymiltzi") as bordering on a parcel being bequeathed.102 In a will from Calimaya in 1762, a boundary is shared with the tequimilli (probably meaning tribute field) of the Sefior del Perd6n.103 These variations of Indian land dedicated to the saints are reminiscent of what Charles Gibson described for the Valley of Mexico as "unofficial cofradia" or "saint's land." Unofficial cofradias were associations that de- rived their income not from purely monetary contributions, but from agri- cultural lands worked by Indian members: Each group cultivated about ten acres of land. Each was administered by an Indian mayordomo who directed the cultivation and finances. The lands were "saints' lands" and they were understood to belong to the images of the saints. The images in this conception were not inanimate representations but the actual possessors. 104 While much of what Gibson describes may help us interpret the examples found in the Toluca Valley wills, some nagging questions remain. Why are cofradfas so rarely mentioned by these testators?

While his saints' land and his cofradia may have been related, one of these two testators does not speak of them in the same context, so a possible association remains elu- sive.105 The other testator provides the only clear cut example of a cofradia operating as might be expected. He ask to be buried in front of the altar of St. Anthony, "as his cofradia brothers know." In the next breath he leaves five magueyes to St. Anthony- presumably these would fall under the charge of the cofradfa, too.'06 Do the other fifty-one testators who associate certain parcels with certain saints expect prospective readers of their wills to know immediately that the saints' land they describe is a part of an unofficial cofradfa-typically not mentioning the obvious? Since none of these testators mentions mayor- domos, are we to assume that the many different heirs they designate to work the saints' land automatically became members of the cofradias?107 Gibson says that the five unofficial cofradias of Chimalhuacan Atenco "did not require a formal membership or an official association of communi- cants" and "although they were known in Chimalhuacan as cofradfas and brotherhoods (hermandades), these terms are not in a strict sense to be applied to them."l18 If the associations Gibson describes were barely co- fradfas, even though they were known as such, perhaps it goes too far to force these Toluca Valley saints' lands into the cofradia category until we have further evidence. 1 The same eighteenth-century document from Guatemala that mentions the commissioning of images in Indian testaments describes the legacies associated with the images as a "genero de capellania" founded in lands, feathers, taffetas, animals, and money, and called in the local language, "vachibales." John Early interprets these arrangements of personal or family devotion to the saints as a kind of "private cofradia," while Robert Hill emphasizes that "guachibales" were distinct from cofradfas.110 As Hill 105 AGN Criminal 230:476r-477r (Ixtlahuaca, 1639).

The land remained under the control of the individual or his/her family, not the Spanish colonial church nor, unless such was taken for granted, even a mayordomo representing an indigenous association. The obligation was passed down over the generations to individuals, both male and female, selected by testators probably for their likelihood to survive the periodic epidemics and to take the responsibility of the task most seriously. (Unfortunately, and contrary to what some might think, the participation of women in this activity alone does not rule out cofradia association, for, although some historians suggest only men belonged, Indian women defi- nitely were members of cofradias.)113 Franciscan records from central New Spain support the existence of indi- viduals bearing responsibility for saints' land outside of the obvious co- fradia activities. Salvador de Santiago of San Mateo Atenco, for example, was listed in the vicariate directory of 1721 as providing three pesos for the mass for Our Lady of the Rosary every October. The money was to come "LL Hill, "Manteniendo el culto," 62-69. 112 An annual procession is the only element in Hill's description of guachibal responsibilities that these Nahuatl testaments do not include in discussions of service to the saints. This omission would seem to further distance this kind of individual service from cofradfas and, by extension, colonial forms of the cargo system. Still, the individual's underwriting of public masses (and possibly processions) may be an early or parallel expression of the cargo holder's sponsorship of fiestas, and may warrant further study. "3 Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest, p. 182. I have a will of an Indian noblewoman from Toluca dating from 1589 that mentions membership in a cofradfa (AGN Hospital de Jesis, vol. 15:1:143-144). James Lockhart, in his forthcoming book, The Nahuas, states that cofradfa membership was well over half female. In colonial Guatemala, female cofradia members were called "texeles," according to a descrip- tion of Catholic liturgy by a Franciscan friar quoted in Early, "Some Ethnographic Implications," 190. Adriaan C. van Oss, "Rural Sodalities in Colonial Guatemala," in Albert Meyers and Diane Elizabeth Hopkins, eds., Manipulating the Saints: Religious Brotherhoods and Social Integration in Postconquest Latin America (Hamburg: Wayasbah, 1988), defines texeles as "mothers" and also describes their role. For colonial Michoacin, Ernesto de la Torre's list of cofradia functionaries includes a great many roles for women; "Algunos aspectos acerca de las cofradias," p. 425. Similarly, in modern Guatemala women continue to hold cofradfa offices.

One was the town governor, who would donate four pesos after harvesting another particular milpa (field). Former governors would also help adorn the altar.115" Although these few individuals represent only a small fraction of people-judging by the testaments-tending saints' land seemingly out- side of cofradias, all of these entries are listed separately from the Fran- ciscan account of cofradia responsibilities. Similarly, the cultivation of saints' land by a few groups is not counted among cofradia duties as they appear in Calimaya's Franciscan directory of 1721. Although they are not described as such, perhaps these groups con- sisted of hermandades. Sacristans of Calimaya, for instance, cultivated a milpilla (small field) to provide for three masses on Holy Thursday at the rate of three pesos each. The cantores (singers in the choir) of the same town worked land that would sustain masses for St. Barbara and St. Ni- cholas. In Tepemaxalco, sacristans covered the mass for St. Joseph.116 Unfortunately, the Franciscan directories, which do provide a monthly accounting of expected masses and celebrations and whose obligation it was to pay for them, do not help provide the definitive answer regarding the precise nature of saints' land. Whether the many testators who cultivated plots with some attachment to a saint are to be counted among the few individuals who made it into the directories or were unproclaimed members of groups, we may never know. The directories do show that individuals and groups not counted among the cofradias and hermandades managed what might still be included in the more general category of saints' land. The lack of documentation for the other individuals represented in the testa- ments would underline the fact that the management of their lands was even more distant from church control. By the late eighteenth century the practice of designating land to support the cult of the saints was in decline in the Valley of Toluca. While, as noted above, the wills studied here are divided about fifty percent-fifty percent in number before and after the year 1750, wills containing saints' land break down to a sixty-five percent-thirty-five percent ratio at the same point in time. In other words, saints' land has a thirty percent higher concentration in the wills before 1750.

She had a larger sampling of wills dating from 1775-1821, and yet she saw no examples of saints' land after 1785. Loera y Chivez also notes a decline in gifts (limosnas) to the Church after 1780, similar to the one noted above, attributing both to the fracciona- miento (progressive division and sub-division of small parcels) and loss of community land that was reaching serious proportions in this and other In- dian towns by the end of the colonial period."7 THE CULT OF THE SAINTS Sometime between the end of the sixteenth and the end of the seventeenth centuries, individuals in Indian communities of New Spain brought the Catholic saints more directly into their lives and homes. By at least 1675 and certainly after, the majority of Nahua testaments from the Toluca Valley show them worshiping the holy images on private altars, providing candles, flowers, and incense, and embracing the honorific job of sweeping around them. Presumably when they could afford it, these individuals built oratories to house their precious images. They named their children after favorite saints, and sometimes bequeathed to those children the special rep- resentations of their personal guardians. They cultivated maize and ma- gueyes to be able to provide for the saints in their homes and community churches. Serving the saints had become a major preoccupation. But, later, the pendulum seems to have swung back a few inches. Gradu- ally, over the eighteenth century, special gifts to saints' altars began to decline in number. New parcels of land devoted to the divinities became fewer. The number of testators mentioning images in their wills began to taper off. Were people becoming lax about mentioning the commonplace in their wills? Was their passion waning? Or was it becoming too costly to continue maintaining the saints in the fashion to which they had become accustomed?118 Access to adequate farm land to sustain the recuperating indigenous pop- "77 Loera y Chavez, Calimaya y Tepemaxalco, p. 85. Of the four wills in my sample dating from post 1785, I have one that mentions serving the saints with land. AGN Tierras 2540:9: lr-v (Santiago Tilapa, 1801). 18 Some might see these developments, again, as a result of changes in church policy that came with the Enlightenment, as Gruzinski (Man-Gods, pp. 112-113) describes, but I doubt it. In the same vein, I do not like to credit the clergy with the greatest responsibility for creating a cult of the saints among the Indians in the first place. If anyone encouraged it, it was probably the indigenous assistants to friars (or perhaps to the more lenient secular priests) who interpreted the saints and their worship in such a way that made them appealing to other Indians. I owe a debt for some of these ideas to Lockhart's forth- coming book.</page><page sequence="32">290 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS ulation (despite periodic epidemics) over the eighteenth century does seem to have been tightening. Litigation at this time over corporate lands in the Toluca Valley was as heated as it was in many other central areas."' Unfor- tunately, sources currently available do not allow for the quantification of parcels or the determination of parcel size available to most Indian families in a given community. While some information of this nature is available, it is spotty. Testators, for instance, frequently mention one or more parcels without providing their dimensions, exact locations, or degree of fertility. We may, however, presume that the progressive designation of agricultural parcels for the support of religious activities would eventually have to slow down or stop in order to avoid cutting into production necessary for the sustenance of the family. It is even conceivable that there may have been a reversal. If plots indi- cated for the saints in these testaments were not recorded in the church directories, as they usually do not appear to have been, and if they did not fall under the charge of a mayordomo or other cofradia official but re- mained instead wholly under individual or family control, it is possible that these plots could have reverted to subsistence parcels when finances and resources tightened. We do know that cofradia properties and possessions saw a late eighteenth-century decline, aggravated particularly by the famine and epidemic of 1785-86.120 Furthermore, produce from individuals' and families' saints' lands may have been used primarily for private advantage all along. Cases are known in which a family's entire holdings were dedi- cated to one or more saints.121 The economic impact on individual and community of serving the saints certainly had the potential of causing hard- ship, but as of now the records would allow some room for adjustment. In no way is it clear that all or even part of the saints' land in these wills became church property and was permanently alienated, as some might as- sume. 122 The question of waning piety is just as cloudy. As S. L. Cline notes, "99 See Wood, "Corporate Adjustments," and Loera y Chivez, Calimava v Tepemaxalco and her Economia campesina indigena en la colonia: un caso en el Valle de Toluca (Mexico: Instituto Nacional Indigenista, Investigaciones Sociales, 8, 1981). 12o Chance and Taylor, "Cofradias and Cargos," 10. 121 Personal information of James Lockhart. 122 This is not to say that there were not other religious drains on community resources in the form of the provisioning of bells, altarpieces, fiestas, and native labor for church construction, among other expenses, as Ronald Spores outlines for colonial Oaxaca in The Mixtecs in Ancient and Colonial Times (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1984), pp. 154-160. The major donations of land to the Church by caciques that he describes was a practice also known in the Toluca Valley. See, for example, the will of dofia Ana Cortis Acaxochitl in AGN, Hospital de Jesis, vol. 15:1:143r-144r (the Spanish translation).</page><page sequence="33">STEPHANIE WOOD 291 most of what we have to work with in the testaments are "outward expres- sions of belief."'23 These indicators may be among the best that will ever be located, but they do not take us as far as we might like to go. Since these wills were not holographs, but were dictated to notaries who employed a varying amount of formula, what sometimes may appear to be a very pious declaration could be the product of notarial flair. An omission in the usual invocations or protestations of faith might be a notarial oversight. Objects of devotion may have also been overlooked by testators who assumed they would remain with the house. A large number of images owned by one individual might not represent his or her pious acquisitions but an inheri- tance of several generations' accumulated possessions. Despite these difficulties in measuring piety, it would appear that over most of the eighteenth century, indigenous individuals continued to exhibit a sincere acceptance of Christianity. Aside from the decline in gifts, people with images, and saints' land being bequeathed, in the other outward forms of religious devotion there are no obvious signs of waning enthusiasm aver time. So, it may be that while belts had to be tightenad, worship comtinued along the lines that had become customary by the late seventeenth century. Can we say, then, that the conversion process proceeded apace over most of the eighteenth century? People were certainly still embracing accepted forms of Catholic religious expression, but behind the passionate service to the saints some observers have detected a flourishing or resurgence of po- lytheism and localism.'24 Even in the sixteenth century, before saints' images became a feature of so many Indian homes, friars were concerned about the fascination with the saints in the churches or special local shrines. One friar complained, "we have plenty of difficulty in making the Indians understand that the images should not be worshiped, for they were made of wood and stone, and here they were being told that the image of Our Lady was performing miracles!"'25 Charles Gibson describes the community of saints as "a pantheon of anthropomorphic deities" in the indigenous view.'26 Both colonial witnesses and modern ethnographers have detected idols behind altars. Speaking of the indigenous people of central New Spain in 123 Cline, Colonial Culhuacan, p. 34. 124 See, for example, Spores, The Mixtecs, p. 142. Of course, these were also features of Catholicism that were favored by Spaniards. See John M. Ingham, Mary, Michael, and Lucifer: Folk Catholicism in Central Mexico (Austin: University of Texas Institute of Latin American Studies, Latin American Monographs, 69, 1986), p. 34. 125 Quoted in Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest, p. 103. 126 Gibson, The Aztecs, p. 100.</page><page sequence="34">292 CHRISTIAN IMAGES IN NAHUA TESTAMENTS the 1570s, Fray Diego Durain notes: "These [Indians], pretending to cele- brate the festivities of our God and of the Saints, insert, mix, and celebrate those of their gods when they fall on the same day." In describing the worship of idols in prehispanic times Durin observes incense being pro- vided "four times day and night, sweeping, sprinkling, and setting up orna- ments of branches. .. ", all reminiscent of later attention paid to saints' images. Just as "Moses and his followers. . . carried the ark of the Cove- nant" (and Christian saints' images would be carried in procession), the "chosen people of Huitzilopochtli" would carry his representation "within an are of rushes."'27 For the seventeenth century, Ronald Spores relays what he suspects is a false report about carved-stone idols being worshiped im a cave in Oaxaca. Reminiscent of the kinds of service associated with saints' images, the ac- cused individuals allegedly provided the idols with candles and copal in- cense. Although the men involved were possibly framed, there was an au- thenticity to the scenario.128 In his Treatise on the Heathen Superstitions that Today Live Among the Indians Native to This New Spain, Hernando Ruiz de Alarc6n reported a similar scene he witnessed in 1626. On St. Michael's day of that year he found a pile of rocks with a small cave and an offering left inside. Ruiz de Alarc6n noted that "copal, candles, bouquets, and other things" made up the usual offering, and the stone pile typically contained "idols or rocks that resemble faces.'"'129 Specific saints and gods have been paired. Joseph Whitecotton sees in Oaxaca, for instance, how San Pedro assumed attributes of the old rain god Cocijo, a leading figure in the Zapotec calendar as San Pedro was in the Catholic one. In Jalapa, Saint Catherine of Siena and Pinopiaa, a Zapotec heroine who was deified, were equated and worshiped at a common shrine.'30 Hugo Nutini and Betty Bell connect San Juan with Tezcatlipoca, Santa Ana with Toci, San Bernardino with Camaxtli (and, consequently, Huitzilo- pochtli), and the Virgin with Xochiquetzalli for pueblos of the Tlaxcala region.'131 Nutini also relates the presence in the same region of prehispanic 127 Durin, Book of Gods, pp. 71, 216, and 225. 128 Spores, The Mixtecs, p. 152. 129 J.

The parishioners' associations, or cofradfas, which may or may not be behind the individual service to the saints evidenced in the testaments, probably had the same effect of reinforcing the new-or syncretic-ex- pressions of Christian spirituality at the very base of Indian society. and the modest reining-in of expenditures for the saints that began about 1750 has not extinguished the faith-far from it. The priest of San Mateo Mexicalt- zingo (in the Toluca Valley) in the early 1980s testified to the many images still worshiped in the homes of his flock. Believing them to have been taken from the church to the safe refuge of private homes during the Revolution of 1910, he once organized a magnificent public display of these images and was much impressed by the devotion shown them.134 The cult of the saints lives on.
