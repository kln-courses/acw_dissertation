<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIANITY AND PHILOSOPHY IN KIERKEGAARD'S EARLY PAPERS BY LOUIS P. POJMAN During the period of 1835 to 1840, the young Kierkegaard struggled with the relationship of Christianity to philosophy. In his private papers he set forth a series of preliminary formulations on the subject which are of interest because they exhibit the concerns which motivated his later theories. During the years 1834-35 Kierkegaard was severely tempted to forsake Christianity. He was offended by his father's religion, deeming it a "mon- strous inhumanity" and its followers a narrow-minded folk possessed by the fixed idea that they alone have the truth and that, therefore, no other human beings are capable of judging them since no other human beings have the criterion for judgment, namely, the truth.' Kierkegaard saw this circular reasoning as an escape from facing the need to find a suitable criterion for assessing religious claims. In a letter to his relative, Peter Wilhelm Lund, he wrote: In Christianity ... the contradictions are so great that, to say the least, they prevent one from a clear view. ... I grew up ... in orthodoxy; but as soon as I began to think for myself, the tremendous colossus began to totter. I refer to it as a colossus on purpose, for taken as a whole it is very consistent and in the course of centuries the different parts have fused so tightly together that it is difficult to quarrel with it. Although I could agree with some parts of the doctrine, these would have to be treated like shoots, found in the cracks of a rock. On the other hand, I also saw what was wrong with it at many points, but I felt bound to suspend judgment on the fundamentals for a time.2 Not only did Kierkegaard have trouble with the doctrine, he was con- temptuous of the dehumanizing effect Christianity has on its adherents. It 1 Cf. S0ren Aabye Kierkegaard, The Point of View for My Work as an Author; A Report to History, and Related Writings. Trans. with introduction and notes by Walter Lowry (New York, 1962), 76f. Fourteen years later he writes concerning his early relation to Christianity: "As a child I was sternly and seriously brought up in Christianity. Humanly speaking, it was a crazy upbringing. Already in my earliest childhood I broke down under the grave impression which the melancholy old man who laid it upon me himself sank under. What wonder then that there were times when Christianity appeared to me the most inhuman cruelty-although never, even when I was farthest from it, did I cease to revere it, with a firm determination that (especially if I did not myself make the choice of becoming a Christian) I would never initiate anyone into the difficulties which I knew .... But I have never definitely broken with Christianity nor renounced it." 2 Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers, ed. and trans. by Howard V. Hong and Edna H.

POJMAN emasculates humanity; instead of giving its followers strength, Christianity robs them of their manhood: When I look at the large number of particular phenomena in the Christian life, I feel that Christianity instead of giving individuals strength-especially in comparison with heathen-actually deprives them of their manhood and causes them to compare to heathen as gelding to stallions. (Papers I A 96) The whole phenomenon is as ridiculous as "Don Quixote mistaking wind- mills for giants and seeing demons chasing him."3 A short time later, his position softened, and he contemplated Christian- ity as a possibility: "It is the same with Christianity or with becoming a Christian, as with all radical cures. One postpones it as long as possible."4 The journals show that it became increasingly difficult for him to postpone the decision. However, three more years were to elapse before the postpone- ment came to an end in his experience of a religious conversion. We know from his journals and from the testimony of his contemporaries that he lived an intensely aesthetic existence during this period, alternating between a high emotional pitch and despair to the point of considering suicide. Between his first steps toward Christianity and his conversion in 1838, a number of entries record his struggle with the significance of Christianity vis-a-vis the intellectual world of his day, a world dominated by Hegelian speculation. His initial negative judgment of 1835 gradually shifted to an appreciation of Christianity as a type of anthropomorphic speculation, not altogether unlike Hegel's characterization of it. Christianity contains hidden philosophical truth which must be discovered beneath the myth and parable: "Every doctrine is nothing other than a more concrete extension of the universal human consciousness," namely, the consciousness of the "mediate relation, through which men must always approach the divine."5 Even prayer in Christ's name he interpreted as a symbolic act which acknowledges the universal consciousness of man: To pray in Christ's name is to pray in such a way that involves the consciousness that we are a link in the development which lies within the race. Only in this way can man place himself in relation to God, whether he acts or prays. Therefore almost every nation has had one or more deity in whose name it prayed, but it was confined to them, because the whole world-consciousness was not involved in these deities, but merely the national consciousness and the local consciousness. (Papers I A 172, June 12, 1836) The whole scheme of Hegelian mediation came to play a central role in Kierkegaard's philosophical theology or what he refers to as "my dogmatic point of view." 3 Papers I A 95, October 19, 1835. 4 Papers, I A 89, October 9, 1835. 5 Papers, II A 440, May 22, 1839.

Only when these ideas in life are translated into the individual person and become mediate, only then does the moral and the religious aspect come forth. Such is my view of these ideas in relation to my dogmatic point of view. (Papers I A 150, March 1836) At this point in Kierkegaard's life "speculation" was not the bad word it was to become. He found a place for it within a personalistic view of theology and he even spoke of a "Christian speculation."6 He did, however, draw back from the implications of his speculative endeavors and concluded that while there may be a Christian philosophy, it must be on Christianity's terms, not philosophy's. Philosophy and Christianity will never allow themselves to be united, for if I hold to the most essential element in Christianity, namely, the redemption, so that this element must, if it really is to be something, be extended over the whole person. Or must I consider his moral ability as impaired while viewing his cognitive faculties as unimpaired? I certainly could consider the possibil- ity of a philosophy according to Christianity, but it would be a Christian philosophy. The relation would not be philosophy's relation to Christianity but Christianity's relation to Christian cognition. (Papers I A 94, October 17, 1835) We see, then, two poles within the young Kierkegaard's thought during this period of his life. One is speculative and metaphysical, emphasizing philosophical speculation and mediation: only by being conscious of his relation to the race as a whole can man come to the Truth. The other pole is subjective and personalistic, emphasizing the superlative importance of one's personal existence and moving in the direction of a leap of faith. For all of his attraction to logical consistency and the comprehensiveness of speculative philosophy, the second pole seemed to pull him more strongly than the first. He could not follow philosophy uncritically; he must ask personal and existential questions: The thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. What would be the use of discovering so-called objective 6Papers, I A 111, Jan. 7, 1836: "The decisive thing in speculating is the talent to see the individual entities in the whole. As such the majority of men never really enjoy a tragedy because for them it falls to pieces in sheer monologue. The same may be said of their appreciation of operas falling into arias, etc. The same process is active in the physical world when I, for example, walked along the road on which there lay interspersing parcels of land between two other parallel roads. Most people can only see the roads, the piece of land and then again the road; but they would not be able to see the whole as being like a piece of cloth with different stripes in it." Cf.

What good would it do me to be able to develop a theory of the state and combine all the details into a single whole, and so construct a world in which I did not live [?] ... what good would it do me to be able to explain the meaning of Christianity if it had no deeper significance for me and for my life? What good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognized her or not, and producing in me a shudder of fear rather than a trusting devotion? I certainly do not deny ... an imperative of understanding and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life. (Papers I A 75, Dru's translation, #22.) We begin to see the existential motif dominate Kierkegaard's thought. Knowledge is good, but action is the goal: "What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know."7 This emphasis on the Good over the True, on personal action as the conditio sine qua non of meaningful living is applied to theology. Christian dogmatics . .. must grow out of Christ's activity, and all the more so because Christ did not establish any doctrine; he acted. He did not teach that there was redemption for men, but he redeemed men. (Papers I A 27, 1835) The decisive moment of turning towards Christianity as essentially anti- speculative, as that which does justice to the subjective aspect of man's nature, appears to come through Kierkegaard's reading of Hamann in the fall of 1836. The young theology student was first struck by Hamann's com- parison of speculative reason to the Mosaic law which must be superseded by the Gospel: Our reason is therefore exactly what Paul calls the Law-and the Command of Reason is holy, righteous, and good; but is it given to make us wise? Even so little as the Law of the Jews made them righteous, but it is given to lead us from the opposite, to show us how irrational our reason is, and that our errors through it should increase, as sin increased through the Law. (Papers I A 237, 1836, quoted by Kierkegaard in German) Reason is as inadequate for solving the ultimate problems of human life as the law is inadequate for solving the problem of sin. Knowledge is abrogated by grace through the Gospel. The truth of the Gospel cannot be understood through reason. It is, continues Hamann, "incredibilis sed verum": Is it not an old idea which you often have heard from me: "incredible but true". Lies and novels, hypotheses and fables must be deemed probable; but 7 Papers, I A 75.</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIANITY IN KIERKEGAARD'S EARLY PAPERS 135 not the truth and fundamental teachings of our faith. (Papers I A 237, a quotation from Hamann) Through Hamann, Kierkegaard discovered the category of humor which comes to replace the category of irony as the deepest attitude towards exis- tence. Irony is necessity's iron law of negation which cancels out all human strivings and aspiration, causing them to add up to zero. Irony is the grim fate which inevitably wins out over man's finitude, causing all his projects to end in death. Humor, on the other hand, he saw as divine freedom which is disjunctive with irony's grim necessity; it is positive and affirms that there is hope even though there is no reason for hope. Humor is the insight that God is wholly other, and so if His truth is ever to break into the sphere of human endeavor, it will surely appear very different from our finite comprehension of what it ought to look like. That is, divine reason is fundamentally disjunc- tive with human reason. Consequently, it is bound to appear to man as absurd. Humor in man is the appropriate attitude towards Divine Folly; only in the absurd does the possibility of seeing God arise. The Hamannian theme continued to dominate Kierkegaard's thought through the fall of 1836. Reasoning, when brought to its ultimate conclusion always ends in an absurdity, a reductio ad absurdum. In an entry which adumbrates a discussion in the Third Chapter of the Philosophical Frag- ments Kierkegaard says that reason's goal is paradoxicality: Just how much the Understanding can achieve in a speculative sense can best be seen in the fact that when it is carried out to its highest potential in explaining the Highest, it must be expressed as a contradictory statement. (Papers I A 243, Sept. 19, 1836; cf. II A 239; III A 108.) The significance of humor, then, is, first, to show just how impoverished finite reason is, to laugh at all man's attempts via his understanding to scale the heavens. Secondly, it has a positive function of opening a person up to accept the reality of paradoxical truth, ultimately to acceptance of the high- est paradox of all, the paradox of the incarnation. Thus, humor is the road to salvation. At this point Kierkegaard is struck by a paragraph in Hamann on the absurd nature of the Christian message. Apparently Kierkegaard believed the quote to be Hamann's, but in fact it comes from the heart of British skepticism. It is a prolepsis of what will appear in fully developed form in the Postscript. The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity. And whoever is moved by faith to assent to it is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person which subverts all the principles of his understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience. (Papers I A 100)</page><page sequence="6">136 LOUIS P. POJMAN The quotation comes from the famous tenth section of Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. What Hume stated with tongue in cheek Kierkegaard took to be an instance of the humorous and profound insight of Hamann: miracle or "wonder" stands in a disjunctive relationship with human reason; it is that which unexpectedly breaks into the affairs and lives of men. The proper response to the wonderful is wonder, not reason. Wonder in the sense of being awed by the supernatural is the appropriate response to the miracles in life, even as humor is the appropriate preparation for it. It is at this point that Kierkegaard returns to the writings of Schleiermacher, the theologian of wonder: Schleiermacher is essentially the basis for a proper orthodox theology (and he will therefore play an important role), however heterodox he is in many regards, and this will naturally be modified significantly since the dogmatic content will receive an entirely other objective determination and definite- ness. But his position is correct in many parts as he has taken the concept of "wonder" in its inwardness into the system instead of as something preliminary remaining outside. His whole position is wonder, and his whole self-consciousness is a pure new Christian self-consciousness. (Papers II A 199, Dec. 7, 1837) In Schleiermacher the two poles, the abstract systematizing and the per- sonal subjective tendency, meet for Kierkegaard. Whereas Hamann is too onesided and lacking in systematic comprehensiveness, Schleiermacher seems to have balanced both tendencies, creating a personal philosophical theology. On closer investigation, however, Schleiermacher turns out to be deficient regarding the paradoxical, even though his response to wonder is correct: "What Schleiermacher calls 'Religion' and the Hegelians 'Faith' is at bottom nothing but the first immediate condition for everything-the vital fluid-the spiritual atmosphere we breathe in-and which cannot therefore with justice be designated by those words."8 Kierkegaard later develops this criticism by charging that Schleiermacher is to be identified with the subjec- tive idealists, Fichte and Schelling, in his dependence on the theory of reciprocity (Wechselwirkung). This theory states that the infinite One is moving itself within the infinite many, always becoming yet always complete in itself. It is pure immanence. Although Kierkegaard seems to have adhered to this idea in 1836, he never did so uncritically and now rejected it as philosophical Calvinism in which both the individual and the system be- come predestined. This system does not really acquire in time the Christian doctrine of time ... nor does it acquire the doctrine about the devil's fall from eternity, nor 8 Papers, I A 273 (Dru's translation #78).</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIANITY IN KIERKEGAARD'S EARLY PAPERS 137 man's fall in time ... nor does it acquire the atonement in time, nor faith (only the immediate consciousness). The first creation gives the immediate consciousness . . .but beyond this one cannot come. Christianity is the second creation (therefore Christ is born of a pure virgin, which again is a creation from nothing. Therefore God's Spirit overshadowed Mary just as it previously hovered over the waters at creation), a new moment, the hearing of the word: faith, which is the immediate consciousness of the second stage. (Papers II A 31, Feb. 1837) Thus, Kierkegaard leads us to the conclusion that philosophy suffers the same devastating criticism as predestination. It is ultimately fatalistic, not being able to leap out of an immanent necessity onto a place where man can be liberated or redeemed. Since without liberation, or the possibility of it, life becomes meaningless, there is something essentially meaningless about speculative philosophy. Even if freedom were an illusion, it would still be of more value than speculative theory because it would give man a reason for acting, whereas philosophical necessity only paralyzes action. To what extent is illusion necessary to man's life? This is a question in relation to the romantic. How does this go with the theory about the necessary course of the world's development and how may this theory work in life? Might it not paralyze all activity since, while annulling (and rightly so) the egoistical, it also annuls the natural and enthusiastic assurance, at least in the moment of battle, that what one is working for is the only right thing. (Papers I A 205, July 11, 1836) In order to live, to act at all, one must believe that one can make a difference, that one is free. This freedom is just "the cross which philosophy could not bear but remained hanging upon."9 In that paralyzed position, philosophers cannot explain the riddle of life. They are like the man who went mad while conscious at every moment that the world went round.10 They are like a person caught in quicksand who begins by calculating how far down he had already sunk, forgetting all the while that he is sinking still deeper." What value is such philosophy to me personally? Kierkegaard asks. None at all, for it does not help me in my struggle to find personal liberation. It does not even allow freedom as a possibility in the individual but swallows both freedom and the individual in its monstrous stomach. Kierkegaard concludes that philosophy is to be rejected because it is unedifying: It is striking how much Hegel hates the edifying (Opbyggelige). It shows itself everywhere, but the edifying is not an opiate which lulls to sleep. It is the finite spirit's Amen and is the side of cognition which ought not to be overlooked.

POJMAN During this same period Kierkegaard took some notes in a theology course at the University of Copenhagen given by his tutor, Hans L. Marten- sen, later to become Kierkegaard's archenemy. Ironically, Martensen's lectures provided an early formulation of the concept of the stages of exis- tence and of the theory of subjectivity. The following entries were made as lecture notes: Only in the same measure that man becomes conscious of himself can he become himself conscious of God; therefore, man must first have gone through the whole of creation's positions, before he finds God. Protestant- ism's principle is characterized as subjectivity; truth is present in the subject, while in Catholicism it is objectively present. (Papers XIII 31, 36) Here we see themes which will be developed in Either/Or, the Climacus' writings, and the Stages on Life's Way. The lecture notes are in fragments, only the important ideas being noted. One wonders how much else was learned from Martensen while Kierkegaard sat at his feet in tutorials or in his classes as a student. In another lecture note we read of the relation of the finite to the infinite which echoes through Kierkegaard's later works. Rationalists assert, ac- cording to Martensen, that the world is only finite, but "this is at bottom a contradiction, for infinite is finitude's boundary, and I must therefore know something about infinity."12 The Kantian idea in Martensen's lectures is that reason is limited, that we can critique reason in order to make way for faith. Philosophy in itself fails to find truth. If philosophy fails to find truth, Christianity fulfills its promise in liberat- ing man from his self-imprisonment. It recognizes that redemption must come from the outside. Yet, Christianity does not paralyze human action as philosophy does through a theory of necessity or predestination but recognizes that paradoxes are the ultimate truth of religious experience. God chooses man in redemption, and yet, at the same time, man's response is made without compulsion. The position the young scholar comes to is synergism, the view that salvation is finally the result of a cooperative effort by God and the indi- vidual, though the initiative remains with God. The following early entry shows the position that Kierkegaard seems to maintain throughout his life. There is a major opposition between Augustine and Pelagius. The first will crush all in order to raise it. The second refers itself to man as he is. The first system views Christianity in three stages: creation; the fall through sin and with it a condition of death and impotence; and a new creation, whereby man becomes placed in a position where he can choose ... Christianity. The other system refers itself to man as he is (Christianity adapted to the world). The importance of the theory of inspiration is seen from the first system. 12 Papers, II C 324.</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIANITY IN KIERKEGAARD'S EARLY PAPERS 139 Here one sees the relation between the synergistic and semi-pelagian conflict. It is the same question, only that the synergistic conflict has the Augustinian system's idea of new creation as its presupposition. (Papers I A 101, 1835) This passage sums up a position which Kierkegaard arrived at through con- siderable reflection. Apparently, the idea of predestination haunted him, for several entries in the early journals deal with the idea. The compromise arrived at is again a consequence of Schleiermacher's theology, the concept of "relative predestination." Here is the real solution to the problem of predestination. When it is said that they are chosen Quos vocavit, they are chosen to salvation or are damned, for what else does the expression quos vocavit mean than those in whose consciousness Christianity emerged, and thus this view can be united with Schleiermacher's relative predestination, for those who have lived in this world but to whom no call came are obviously not predestined (since they are not called); nor is it enough to be able to say anyone is called but only the person in whose consciousness Christianity has emerged in relation to the rest of his life views. (Papers I 295, December 1, 1836) Predestination in the sense of quos vocavit, being called by God and elected, is thus transformed from an objective dogma (as it may be seen in Calvinism or Luther's writings) into a subjective awareness of God's sovereign grace in one's life, which paradoxically does not annul the awareness of freedom. The synergistic motif dominates: it is God who has acted in procuring our salva- tion, yet our response is vital to his activity. This is exactly the position Climacus takes in the Fragments. Grace is the condition which makes the choice of faith possible. These were the sort of concerns which occupied Kierkegaard during his student days before and around the time of his conversion on May 19, 1838, when he wrote: 10:30 A.M. There is an indescribable joy which penetrates all through us which is as incomprehensible as the apostle's spontaneous exclamation: "Rejoice and again I say to you, Rejoice!"-Not a joy over this or that, but the soul's fullest outpouring, "with tongue and mouth and from the heart's reason"; I rejoice in my joy, in, with, at, on, by and with my joy-a heavenly refrain which suddenly ends all our other songs; a joy which like a breeze cools and refreshes, a breath of wind from an Etesian gale which blows from Mamre to the eternal dwellings. (Papers I A 228) We don't know what prompted this ecstatic entry, nor are we certain that this constitutes the actual conversion of Kierkegaard, but we do know that Kierkegaard shortly afterwards was reunited with his estranged father, re- sumed communion at the cathedral next to the university, and resumed his theological studies with a view towards the ministry.</page><page sequence="10">140 LOUIS P. POJMAN The student entries thus reveal some of the first attempts of Kierkegaard to deal with issues which were to occupy him during the rest of his life. In them we find early formulations of the concept of subjectivity, the relation of philosophy to Christianity, a flirtation with speculative philosophy, a suggestion of the stages of existence based on Martensen's lectures, and a strong leaning towards a synergistic view of redemption reconciling the ideas of free will and election in a way similar to and based on Schleier- macher's idea of relative predestination. We see the formative influences of Martensen, Hamann (and through him Hume!), Schleiermacher, and Augustine. We see too the tension in Kierkegaard's early work between the poetic, personal pole and the speculative, rationalist pole. In these early entries the subjective or personal pole enjoys a hegemony, but the specula- tive and analytic is never entirely absent. Action is prior to reason in his thought, but action needs reason for its own uses. One sees too that the personal struggles Kierkegaard was having with his own fate (a suspicion that a curse lay on the family because of his father's sins) and vocational uncer- tainty must have influenced him in the direction of the subjective. While it is always difficult to know for certain how seriously to take or how exactly to interpret journal entries, the ones we have looked at give us clues to the sources of some of Kierkegaard's most characteristic ideas. The student of Kierkegaard should examine the work of Hamann, Schleiermacher, and Martensen with greater interest than has heretofore been the case in order to understand Kierkegaard's thought more thoroughly.
