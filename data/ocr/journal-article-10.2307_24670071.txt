In contrast to previous interpreta tions that view that polemic as aimed at rejecting Christian or Gnostic concepts, the present paper suggests that Two Powers was conceived by Tannaitic sources as an expression of existential giving up on God, which stemmed from His inability to demonstrate His power, as was exposed in the military defeat of the Jews in their wars against the Roman Empire. Keywords Two Powers in Heaven; Christianity; Gnosticism; heresy; minut\ Tannaitic midrash To assert that only theological interpretation of the canonical texts is legitimate is surely only another kind of reductionism. Wayne A. Meeks "Two Powers in Heaven" has been a perennial subject of interest among students of ancient Judaism and early Christianity.1 Since the publication in 1977 of Alan F. Segal's book under this title, the subject has been dealt with in several important studies.2 Customarily scholarly discussions treat " The most comprehensive treatment of the subject, which includes references to earlier discussions as well, is Alan F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity Christianity and Gnosticism (Leiden: Brill, 1977). 2' Cf. Daniel Boyarin, "Two Powers in Heaven; Or, The Making of a Heresy," in The Idea of Biblical Interpretation: Essays in Honor of James L. Kugel (ed.

Schremer /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 231 Two Powers as an expression of a theological stance embraced by a specific group, a "philosophical school" as it were. At times it is suggested that those who embraced that stance derived their view, above all, from various biblical passages that appeared to be suggesting the existence of a second divine authority besides God.3 This frequently results in a quest for the precise identity of that school, which leads scholars to place much weight on the question whether Two Powers should be seen as a reference to Christianity or to Gnosticism.4 According to this approach, the rabbinic polemic against Two Powers belongs to the sphere of "thought," and the Rabbis are presented as striving to reject the concept of Two Powers because they considered it as a false teaching. Responsible for this view is, first and foremost, a Christianizing approach to the rabbinic sources, that is, a reading of the rabbinic material through the prism of Christian concepts and thought, the most important of which is the widespread presumption that "religiosity in antiquity was a matter of belief and doctrine."5 As a result, it is frequently assumed that the rabbinic polemic against Two Powers must have been motivated by a theo logical concern. Daniel Boyarin, for example, in his recent discussion of Two Powers, states this very explicitly: "Just as for Christian orthodoxy the arch-heresy for the rabbis [Two Powers] also involved, not surprisingly, a "flaw" in the doctrine of God"6 And just like Segal he places much weight on the question concerning the identity of the adherents of this heresy, which he identifies as Christians.7 Judith Η. Newman; Leiden: Brill, 2004), 331-70; idem, Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-ChristianityJudaeo-Christianity (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003), 128-47. 31 See, for example, Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 261: "The early biblical theophanies which picture God as a man or confuse YHWH with an angel are the basis of the tradition." 4) See, for example: Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 3: "The intention of this book is to collect and examine the rabbinic reports about the heresy of "two powers in heaven" and to iden tify the proponents of the heresy"; ibid., 260: "It is now time to return to the original ques dons of the inquiry: Which extra-rabbinic groups are most likely to have been the targets of the rabbinic polemic?" Segal distinguishes between antagonistic and complementary dualism (which he terms "binitarianism"), and suggests that it was the latter which was the main focus of the rabbinic polemic against Two Powers. 51 Cf.: David Frankfurter, "Beyond 'Jewish Christianity': Continuing Religious Sub-Cultures of the Second and Third Centuries and Their Documents," in The Ways That Never Parted (ed. Adam H. Becker and Annette Yoshiko Reed; Tiibingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003), 131. 61 Boyarin, "Two Powers," 335; idem, Border Lines, 131. 71 Boyarin, "Two Powers," 347. I shall discuss the manner by which Boyarin arrives at this conclusion in more detail below.</page><page sequence="3">232 A. Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 This paper takes a different path. In contrast to previous interpretations I suggest that Two Powers, as constructed by early rabbinic sources, is one of a variety of theoretical options, which early rabbinic sources view as an expression of existential giving up on God, because of His inability to dem onstrate His power, as was exposed in the destruction of the Second Tem pie and the military defeat of the Jews in the Bar Kokhba revolt. On this reading, Two Powers was not considered by the Rabbis as a threat due to a theological challenge it imposed to the monotheistic principle, as it is fre quently seen.8 Rather, for Palestinian Rabbis of the second century the threat was the existential mood of despair from which Two Powers was assumed to have sprung, and the expression of religious qualms concern ing Gods power it carried.9 This interpretation is facilitated by the awareness of the methodological need to distinguish between early, that is Tannaitic, references to Two Pow ers, and later, Amoraic (and post-Amoraic) materials pertaining to this theologoumenon, the need for which hitherto scholarly discussions have failed to recognize.10 My contention is that the scholarly amalgamation of sources that are far removed one from the other, both chronologically and at times also geographically, prevents us from appreciating the specific meaning that the concept retained in different historical circumstances, and obscures possible developments that this concept had undergone. However, once the pivotal role that historical circumstances played in the rabbinic construction of Two Powers is recognized, it becomes apparent why the discussion must be confined (at least in its initial stage) to the 81 Compare: Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 261, who views the issue as a "polemics for monotheism." 91 In suggesting that for second-century Palestinian Rabbis Two Powers was not a pure theological problem, but rather an existential reaction to concrete historical events of mili tary defeat, I do not wish, in any way, to be understood as claiming that this is the only perspective existing in the entire rabbinic corpus of late antiquity. Change through time is the fate of most human ideas, the one to be discussed here is no exception. Therefore, the possibility that Two Powers retained a different meaning in rabbinic sources of later times should not pose any difficulty to the thesis hereby suggested, which concentrates primarily on the rabbinic sources of late first and second centuries C.E. 101 This flaw is relentlessly present in Segal's work, but it should be noted that even Boya rin's far more sophisticated treatment of the rabbinic material suffers from the same weak ness. See his recent admission in his "Archives in the Fictions: Rabbinic Historiography and Church History," in The Cultural Turn in Late Ancient Studies: Gender, Asceticism, and His toriographytoriography (ed. Dale B. Martin and Patricia Cox Miller; Durham: Duke University Press, 2005), 179.</page><page sequence="4">A. Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 233 Tannaitic sources. Later, Amoraic sources will be left aside, in order to avoid the danger of anachronistic projections of notions that may be exist ing only in late, Amoraic, materials onto the early, Tannaitic, ones. In spite of the impression one might gain from many scholarly discus sions, in the latter sources Two Powers is mentioned in a very limited num ber of places. It is mentioned in a single tradition in the Tannaitic midrashic compilations on Deuteronomy (the Sifre to Deuteronomy and the Mekhilta to Deuteronomy); in a single tradition in the Tannaitic midrashic compila tions on Exodus (the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael and the Mekhilta de Rashbi)·,Rashbi)·, and once in Sifre Zutta on Numbers. All in all Two Powers appears only in three distinct Tannaitic traditions. Except for these traditions, which will be discussed below, the concept does not appear elsewhere in Tannaitic literature.11 The decision which of these texts should serve as a point of departure for the discussion is a crucial matter for a proper interpretation of the concept, as it constructs our pre-disposition regarding the question what is at stake. Many of the scholarly treatments of the topic take the first occurrence of the theme in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael as their starting point. As I view the tradition in the Sifre to Deuteronomy (and its very close parallel in the Mekhilta to Deuteronomy) as the key source for a proper under standing of Two Powers, I shall begin the discussion with this tradition. 11י Μ. Sanh. 4:5 refers to a possible claim of minim, that there are "many powers in heaven." Such an assertion may be related to the concept of Two Powers, but it is difficult to prove this conjecture. To be sure, several customs related to by the Mishnah were interpreted by the Palestinian and the Babylonian Talmuds as expressions of belief in Two Powers. Thus, for example, m. Ber. 5:3 ("He who says, 'May Your mercy reach the nest of a bird,' or 'For good may Your name be mentioned,' 'we give thanks, we give thanks,' is silenced"), was interpreted in b. Ber. 33b on the basis that, "he appears to be [accepting the concept of] Two Powers." Although such an interpretation cannot be ruled out, it must be emphasized that the concept itself is not mentioned as such in this mishnah (cf. The Mishnah with Vari ant Readings,ant Readings, ed. Nisan Sacks [Jerusalem: Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud, 1975], 1.43, n. 15). It is noteworthy that the Palestinian Talmud (y. Ber. 5:3, 9c) comments on that passage in the Mishnah and allows the use of these formulae in private! This casts serious doubts on the assumption that the reason behind the mishnah's ruling was a need to avoid any mention ofTwo Powers. Had it been understood so in Palestine it is difficult to see how could the Talmud allow these formulae to be used. Another liturgical formula, mentioned and silenced by m. Meg. 4:9 ("He who says, "The good shall bless you'"), is interpreted by the Palestinian Talmud (y. Meg. 4:9, 75c) as an expression of belief in Two Powers. In this case too, it should be noted that the concept is not explicitly mentioned in that mishnah.</page><page sequence="5">234 A. Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 I. "If He is really a God let Him come and protest" God's declaration of His Divinity, in Deut 32:39 ("See now that I, even I, am He"), has attracted commentators for generations.12 The early rab binic midrash in the Sifre to Deuteronomy views it as a reply to various "heretical" stances, among which is the assertion that "there are two Pow ers in heaven": "See now that I, even I, am He [who is]" (Deut 32:39)—this is a refutation of those who maintain that there is no Power in heaven. He who says: "There are two Powers in heaven," is answered: "And there is no God with me" (ibid.). Perhaps [there is Power in heaven but] He has no ability to revive or to kill, to do evil or to make good? Scripture teaches: "I kill and give life" (ibid.).13 This midrashic reading views Deut 32:39 as a polemical verse directed against seemingly different theological stances: a complete denial of God ("there is no Power in heaven"); a claim that "there are two Powers in heaven"; and a denial of Gods power ("He has no ability to revive or to kill, to do evil or to make good"). According to the midrash, God's declara tion: "See now that I, even I, am He," should be understood as a claim concerning His very existence. Although the biblical verse is usually ren dered by modern translations of the Hebrew bible as: "See now that I, even I, am He," the midrash, with all likelihood, read the demonstrative pro noun הוא as Π1Π—i.e. "present"; existing. Consequently, the midrash could claim that this verse may serve a refutation of the assertion that "there is no Power in heaven," for God says: "See now that I exist." At the same time, the midrash argues, the following words of this verse may serve a refutation of the assertion that "there are two Powers in heaven," for God is saying here: "and there is no god besides me." And the final words of the verse may serve a refutation of the assertion that even though God exists He has no power to kill or to give life, since Scripture says explicitly, "I kill and I revive."14 12' For a survey of early Jewish and Christian interpretations of this verse see Catrin H. Williams, I am He: The Interpretation of Ani Hu' in Jewish and Early Christian Literature (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2000). 13) Sifre Deuteronomy §329 (ed. Louis Finkelstein [repr. New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1969], 379). 141 Segals claim that, "those who believe in God but deny His ability to kill or bring to life are refuted by reference to Is. 44:6" (Two Powers in Heaven, 85) is awkward, especially in light of his own translation of the passage in the Sifre (ibid., 84), where the answer to that</page><page sequence="6">A. Schremer / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 235 In order to follow this midrashic interpretation of the biblical verse, that is, as a reply to these "heretical" stances, one must see the midrash's reading of the entire "plot," alluded to by the preceding verses of the biblical Song. After Jeshurun, who is understood by the rabbis to refer to Israel, "waxed fat and kicked" (Deut 32:15), he "forsook God who made him and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation" (32:16). Furthermore, Israel stirred God to jealousy with strange gods, and "provoked Him to anger" (ibid.). As a punishment, "The Lord saw it, and spurned them because of the provoca tion" (32:19). He decides to hide His face from them (32:20), and to deliver them into the hands of their enemies (32:21). Then He brings upon them various kinds of severe punishments (32:23-25), until He real izes that Israel's enemies might not realize His strategy, but instead boast on their own might (32:27). According to one reading of the Song, this is given expression in w. 36 38: "When he sees that their power is gone and there is none remaining, bond or free; Then he will say: Where is their God, the rock in which they took refuge, who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protec tion!" On this reading, the subject of these verses ("Then he will say") is the enemy, who taunts and blasphemes by crying out: "Where is their [= Isra el's] God! Let them [read: Him] rise up and help you! Let them [read: Him] be your [= Israels] protection." And to this God replies in v. 39: "See now that I, even I, am He." This reading, which is found in various Targumim,15 is attributed by the Sifre,Sifre, in the passage just preceding the one with which we are dealing, to the mid-second century Palestinian sage, Rabbi Nehemiah: "Then he will say: Where are their gods" (Deut 32:37)—Rabbi Judah ex pounds it as referring to Israel, and Rabbi Nehemiah expounds it as referring claim is correctly presented in the words of Deut 32:39 itself. See also Herbert W. Basser's criticism of Segal in the formers Midrashic Interpretations of the Song of Moses (New York: SUNY, 1981), 240-41. Compare, however: Menahem Kahana, "Pages of the Deuteronomy Mekhilta on Ha'azinu and Wezot ha-Berakha," Tarbiz 57 (1988): 178, n. 74 [Hebrew], 151 See M. Ginsburger, Pseudo-Jonathan (Thargum Jonathan ben Usielzum Pentateuch) (Ber lin: S. Calvary, 1903), 360; Michael L.

The LXX, as well as 4Q44 (4QDeut&lt;!) 4, in contrast, reflect the understanding that the subject of v. 36 ("Then he will say") is God, who refers to the weakness of the gods of the nations. Cf.

Rabbi Judah says: Israel are destined to say to the Nations of the world... Rabbi Nehemiah says, this refers to the wicked Titus, son of the wife of Vespasian, who entered the holy of hollies and tore the two veils with the sword and said: "If he is really a god, let Him come and protest"!16 In contrast to Rabbi Judah, who views Deut 32:37 as directed to the Nations of the world, Rabbi Nehemiah reads that verse as the enemy's address, whom he identified with the Roman emperor Titus. According to Rabbi Nehemiah's interpretation, Titus is the subject ("he") of the clause, "Then he will say." What will he say?—"Where are their gods," that is, in Rabbi Nehemiah's words, Titus' blasphemous declaration: "If He is really a god, let Him come and protest."17 Titus' implicit assumption is that God's silence reflects not only His inability to fight, but His very death. In a slightly later rabbinic text this is stated very explicitly: They destroyed all of Jerusalem, until they reached the Temple. When they reached the Temple, they said to one another: Who will be first to enter the Temple? There was present there a wicked man, Titus, the son of Vespasian's wife, who defiantly entered, confirming the verse: "A wicked man puts on a bold face" (Prov 21:29). What is more, he drew his sword and slashed the 161 Sifre Deuteronomy §328 (ed. Finkelstein, 378-79). An almost identical tradition appears also in the Mekhilta to Deut 32:37, MS Yehuda Nahum 242.80. See Kahana, "Pages from the Mekhilta to Deuteronomy," 190; idem, The Genizah Fragments of the Halakhic MidrashimMidrashim (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2005), 354. The tradition is found in later rabbinic sources as well: Gen. Rab. 10:7 (ed. Yehuda Theodor and Chanoch Albeck [repr. Jerusalem: Wharmann, 1965], 1:82-83); Lev. Rab. 20:5 (ed. Mordecai Mar gulies [London and Jerusalem: Arrarat, 1954], 2:458); Psiqta de-Rav Kahna, Aharei Mot, 5 (ed. Bernard Mandelbaum [New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1962], 2.392); Qoh. Rab. 8:5; Midr. Ps. 121:3 (ed. Solomon Buber [Villna: Rom, 1891], 506); Deut. Rab., Devarim, 21 (ed. Saul Lieberman [Jerusalem: Wharmann, 19702], 21); Tanh.,Tanh., Aharei Mot, 4; Tanh. (ed. Buber), Aharei Mot, 5; ibid., Huqat, 1. On Titus' designa tion as "the son of Vespasian's wife," see Saul Lieberman, Greek in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1941), 164-65· 171 In the parallel version in the Mekhilta to Deuteronomy Titus is said explicitly to have "taunt and blasphemed." See Kahana, "Pages from the Mekhilta to Deuteronomy," 190 (= idem, Genizah Fragments of the Halakhic Midrashim, 354). Note that the source of this phrase is Ps 44:17, which was read by Palestinian Rabbis in reference to the Jews' defeat in their wars against the Roman Empire.

Schremer / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 237 curtains, and blood began to spurt forth from them, and the evil one (Titus) thought that he killed "himself" (God), confirming what Scripture says: "He runs stubbornly against God with a thick-bossed shield" (Job 15:26). What is more, he dragged a prostitute into the Holy of Hollies, and he began to blaspheme, curse, vilify and spit toward Him on high, saying; So this is the one who you say slaughtered Sisera and Sennacherib?! Here I am in his house and in his domain, if he has any power let him come out and face me! This was to fulfill what Scripture says: "Then he will say, "where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge, who ate the fat of their sacrifices" (Deut 32: 37-38).18 According to this story, "The evil one (Titus) thought that he killed 'him self,'" which is an obvious euphemism for God.19 The story gives voice, in the most explicit manner, to the thought that Titus actually killed God. Presumably, Rabbi Nehemiah himself did not share this view; in fact the story as a whole is aimed at refuting this thought, for it goes on to narrate Titus' painful death, thereby arguing that this was God's demonstration of His great power, and overturning Titus' thought that he killed God in His house. Nevertheless, the fact that the author allowed such a speculation to be heard is in itself a strong indication as of that view's circulation and 181 Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version B, Chapter 7 (ed. Solomon Schechter [Wien, 1887], 20). Admittedly, in its present form this is a late work, and should be dated somewhere between the sixth and the eighth centuries C.E. See Menahem Kister, Studies in Avot de Rabbi Rabbi Nathan: Text, Redaction and Interpretation (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University and Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 1998), 217-22. As Kister noted, however, its roots are in theTannaitic period, and there are traces of a relatively early redaction, somewhere in the third century C.E. Furthermore, the story is found also in Lev. Rab. 22:3 (ed. Margulies, 2:499-502) and in the Babylonian Talmud (b. Git. 56b), and a reference to it is found in Gen. Rab. 10:7 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, 1:82-83). Its end (that is, Titus' punishment, which I omitted for the sake of brevity), moreover, is hinted at by the concluding remark in the Sifre itself: "On every thing God forgives; but on the crime of profaning His Name he punishes immediately." Implicit in this remark is the reader's acquaintance with a tradition regarding Titus' fate, which, in turn, seems indeed to substantiate the antiquity of the tradition. Indeed, since at its end we find Rabbi Elazar ben Yossi commenting on it, it stands to reason that at least some form of the story was known already at his time, that is, at the second half of the second century. Indeed, I see no reason to question the attribution to Rabbi Nehemiah, and consequently to date the tradition to the mid-second century C.E. See also Moshe D. Herr, "Persecution and Martyrdom in Hadrian's Days," Scripta Hierosolymitana 23 (1972): 119, 119, n. 123. See Rashi ad b. Git. 56b, s.v.</page><page sequence="9">238 A. Schremer / journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 attractiveness.20 This tradition reflects, then, a theological and existential crisis, with which many Jews of the time were faced: the possibility that Rome's victory means the obliteration of Israel's God.21 Three different explanations could have been suggested, by one who was exposed to such thoughts, to account for the Jews' defeat and to the destruction of the Temple: The first could be that God was indeed killed and He does not exist any longer. Alternatively, one could decide that God may still be living, but His power has diminished, and it is for this reason that He was unable to defend Himself. Still there was another possibility, namely, that God may exist, but he was defeated because there are other divine powers, other gods, who might, at times, be stronger than Him. These are, indeed, the three possibilities raised by the Sifre, as we have seen above. The Sifres construction of Deut 32:39 as a refutation of these assertions indicates that the Sifre understood them as different expressions of of one and the same basic attitude of doubt concerning God's Power and ultimately His divinity, which is given the sharpest expression in Titus' words: "If He is really a god, let Him come and protest!" For the Sifre, then, the problem presented in the concept ofTwo Powers was not different from the threat embedded in the assertion that there in "no Power in heaven," or from the danger of the assertion that God lost His power.22 201 As was noted long ago by Arthur Marmorstein, "It would be a mistake to assume that only pagans held such views about Gods power as ascribed to Titus. There must have been many Jews after 68 C.E., and after the catastrophe in the year 135, who doubted Gods might." See Arthur Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God: I. The Names &amp;Attri butesbutes of God (repr. New York: Ktav, 1968), 171. Urbach too writes that: "Titus's argument was not invented by the Sages. It was adduced by many." See Ephraim E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Their Concepts and Belief (trans. Israel Abrahams; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987), 92. 211 This aspect of the story, which seems to me to be its heart, is somewhat neglccted in recent discussions of the text. See, for example, Galit Hasan-Rokem, "Within Limits and Beyond: History and Body in Midrashic Texts," International Folklore Review 9 (1993): 5 12; idem, "Narratives in Dialogue: A Folk Literary Perspective on Interreligious Contacts in the Holy Land in Rabbinic Literature of Late Antiquity," in Sharing the Sacred: Religious Contacts Contacts and Conflicts in the Holy Land First-Fifieenth Centuries CE (ed. Guy Stroumsa and Arie Kofski; Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 1998), 109-29; Joshua Levinson, '"Tragedies Naturally Performed': Fatal Charades, Parodia Sacra, and the Death of Titus," in Jewish Culture Culture and Society Under the Christian Roman Empire (ed. Richard Kalmin and Seth Schwartz; Leuven: Peeters, 2003), 349-82. 221 And this is the case also with Sifre Zutta to Num 15:30 (ed. Haym S. Horovitz [repr. Jerusalem: Wharmann, 1966], 286), where both "he who maintains that there is no Power</page><page sequence="10">A. Schremer / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 239 Either one of these stances was understood by the midrash as an expression of one and the same doubt concerning God's competence, the source of which was the destruction of the Second Temple and the Jews' defeat in their wars against Rome. The fact that the Sifre treats all three assertions jointly indicates that it was not the distinctive theological content of each one of them which stood at the forefront of the rabbinic concern. Rather, these assertions attracted rabbinic polemic because they were considered as potentially harmful. For, doubting God's sovereignty might lead to question His divinity, and as a result to a renunciation of Him and His people. Accord ingly, Two Powers, as seen from the perspective of this midrashic text (just like the other two assertions treated by the Sifre, that is, that there is no God at all, or the assertion that God has no power), is not a theological claim which needs to be refuted because of its specific erroneous content (that is, because according to rabbinic concepts of monotheism there can be no more than one God), as such, but rather because of its implied doubt concerning God's significance in the present world. Furthermore: it need not necessarily be a view held by a specific group; it may well be an exis tential view held by any individual attempting to account for the Romans' victories and the Jews' defeat. II. "I am the Lord your God" While the tradition in the Sifre to Deuteronomy appears to suggest that, Two Powers was understood by the Rabbis as a stance which is, first and foremost, an outcome of historical reality, the tradition relating to Two Pow ers in the Tannaitic midrashic works on Exodus appears to depict Two Powers from a different perspective. Thus we read in two close parallels in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael: in heaven," and "he who maintains that there are two Powers in heaven," are presented together 3stogether 3stogether 3s the examples for the crime of "he who acts with a high hand... reviles the Lord" (Num 15:30). The conjunction of these two opposite theological assertions indicates that from the point of view of the Tannaitic text they are not, in fact, so different as they appear to be if thought of from a pure theological perspective.</page><page sequence="11">240 A.

Schremer /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 241 This is a circular midrash, which follows a well known structure in Tan naitic homiletical works.26 It begins with a question concerning the func tion of a specific verse ("why is this said?"), and it argues that the verse under discussion (Exod 20:2 in the pericope in Bahodesh·, Exod 15:3 in the pericope in Shirta) was needed because without it a mistaken conclusion could have been reached, as a result of an impression left by other verses in Scripture. In order to avoid that error Scripture needed to write the verse under discussion, so as to proclaim its true message and thus to preclude a possible mistake. What was that possible mistake? Alan Segal, commenting on the peri cope in Shirta, suggests that: "The exegetical root of the tradition is the repetition of the name of God, YHWH, and the problems which arise from that."27 Along similar lines writes Robert Hayward: "The fact that the divine Name YHWH is found twice in one verse of Scripture is not to be taken as a point of departure for the heretical proposition that there are two Lords."28 Jacques van Ruiten, who discusses the pericope in Bahodesh, follows the same line of interpretation: "According to the author of the Midrash a problem is raised by the fact that Exod 20:2 gives two different designations for God."29 Recently this understanding of the midrash was proposed also by Catrin Williams, who writes that: "The pericope in Shirta 4...4... attempts to account for the twofold occurrence of the tetragramma ton in Exod. 15:3, and the similar version in Bahodesh 5 seeks to explain the appearance of two divine names in Exod. 20:2."30 According to this understanding of the midrash, the root of the concept ofTwo Powers is the double reference to God in various verses in Scripture. Thus, Two Powers is understood as a theological stance derived from theological thinking, which is based on the text of the Hebrew bible. 261 This structure, which is found in numerous places in the Tannaitic midrashic compila tions, is characteristic of the works of the school of Rabbi Ishmael (that is, primarily, the MekhiltaMekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael and the Sifre to Numbers), but only rarely can it be found in the works emanating from the school of Rabbi Aqiva (such as the Sifra, the Sifre to Deuteron omy [in its halakhic portions], and the Mekhilta de-Rashbi to Exodus). 271 Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 36. 281 Robert Hayward, Divine Name and Presence: IheMemra (Totowa: Allanheld, Osmun &amp; Co., 1981), 31. 2,1 J.

Schremer / Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 In spite of its popularity, this interpretation is difficult to accept. As noted above, the hermeneutic move in those midrashic passages that begin with the formula "Why is this said" never points at a difficulty in the verse upon which the midrash comments. As Daniel Boyarin correctly describes that move, "The verse that is cited at the opening of the midrash is not the verse that causes the problem but the verse that will provide a solution to the problem. The point of the midrash is to demonstrate the necessity for the verse cited in the lemma by showing that without it, there would be some error or difficulty."31 That difficulty cannot rest in the cited verse itself, obviously, for one cannot maintain that a verse that causes a problem serves at the same time its solution.32 Of necessity, then, the problem is rooted elsewhere. Admittedly, this is difficult to see in the pericope in ShirtaShirta—which is, indeed, a major reason for considering that pericope as secondary and redactional33—but in Bahodesh the structure complies very well with the standards of midrashic hermeneutics in addressing the ques tion, "Why is this said": two different verses (Exod 15:3, on the one hand, and Exod 24:10, on the other hand), when juxtaposed, pose a difficulty, for which Exod 20:2 provides (according to the midrash) a solution. The midrash claims, then, that the words "I am the Lord thy God who brought you out of the land of Egypt" enable us to overcome a difficulty with which one might have been confronted due to the two different Scriptural 311 Boyarin, "Two Powers," 343, n. 40; idem, Border Lines, 301-2, n. 45. 321 For this reason il is difficult to accept Jacob Lauterbach's suggestion that the midrash does not refer to the cited lemma ("God is a man ofWar"), but rather to the second part of the verse, "God is His Name," and that it was this aspect in the biblical verse which caused the problem for the midrash. See Jacob Z. Lauterbach, "Some Clarifications on the Mekh ilta," in Sefer Klausner: A Collection of Science and Belles-Lettres Gatheredfor Professor Yoseph KlausnerKlausner on His Sixtieth Jubilee (ed. Naftali H. Torchyner et al.; Tel Aviv: Amanut Ltd, 1937), 185 [Hebrew]. See also Judah Goldin, The Song at the Sea Being a Commentary on a Commentary Commentary in Two Parts (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1971), 126. Since, however, the midrashic question, "Why is this said," never points to a difficulty within a single verse, but always at a difficulty which emerges (in the author's view) from another place in Scrip ture (for which the verse commented on is presented as the solution), Lauterbach's interpre tation cannot be accepted. Note, also, that following the passage under discussion the MekhiltaMekhilta offers other interpretations to the words "God is a man of war," and only much later it comments on the words "The Lord is His name" (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 131; ed. Lauterbach, 2:35). 33' Transfer of passages is one of the most prevalent phenomena in midrashic literature. Cf. Chanoch Albeck, Einleitung und Register zum Bereschit Rabba (Jerusalem: Wharmann Books, 1965), 2-11 [Hebrew].</page><page sequence="14">A.

Thus, for example, in Sifre on Num bers 28:8, Shimon ben Azzai argues that Scripture intentionally avoided the use of different divine names (e.g. Elohim, Shaddai; Tzvaot) in all of the descriptions of sacrifices in the Torah, in order not to let the minim have an opportunity to conclude, on the basis of Scriptures use of different names for God, that there are multiple divinities.36 On this reading, the significance of Exod 20:2 is that it uses both names simultaneously ("I am the Lord thy God"), and thus indicates that God is one and the same Per son, in spite of His various names.37 Such an interpretation has a great advantage, as it easily explains the midrash's reference to Exod 24:10. Unfortunately, however, this interpre tation too cannot be accepted, for it flatly contradicts the midrash's own 341 Lauterbach ("Clarifications," 188), commenting on the later parallel to our midrash in PsiqtaPsiqtaPsiqta de-Rav Kahuna, Bahodesh Hashlishi, 24 (ed. Mandelbaum, 1:223), realized that our midrash was understood along this line by the editor(s) of that later parallel. Since this understanding flatly contradicts his suggested reading of the midrash—according to which the verses cited do not function as a support for the midrash's claim that at Sinai God revealed Himself to Israel as an old man, but rather are themselves loci in which the midrash finds the same difficulty of God's different appearances (see below, n. 41)—he therefore claimed that the later text simply misunderstood the original meaning of the Tannaitic midrash. Although such judgments cannot be ruled out on a principal level, in this par ticular case they do not seem to be very much convincing, as a similar failure he needs to attribute (ibid., 187) to the editor of the tradition as it appears in Mekhilta de-Rashbi, which is a Tannaitic work. 551 Cf. Urbach, The Sages, 451; Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 38. 361 Sifre Numbers §143 (ed. Horovitz, 191). See also Sifra, NecLava, 2:5 (ed. Louis Finkel stein [New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1983], 2:22); b. Men. 110b. Irenaeus of Lyons' comment in Against Heretics, 2.35.3, is of interest in this context: "If anyone should oppose us because of the various Hebrew names placed in the scriptures, such as Sabaoth and Eloe and Adonai, etc., trying to prove from them that there are various Powers and gods, they must learn that all such terms are designations and terms for one and the same being."

Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 explanation of the nature of the problem. The midrash does not locate the root of the problem in Scripture's reference to God by different names·, it relates the problem to God's different appearances.38 It is because at the sea "He appeared to them as a hero doing battle," while at Sinai "He appeared to them as an old man full of mercy," that one might err and think that there are two Powers.39 Even so, however, the midrash does not claim that "the Nations of the world" derive their view from God's different manifes tations, or from the different depictions of God's revelation in Scripture; it rather maintains only that God's different manifestations could have been (mis)used by "the Nations of the world" as a support for their otherwise known contention that there are two Powers. Of the roots and nature of that contention, as such, the midrash says nothing. This description of the midrashic argument, which adheres to the midrash's language and terminology, has been recently challenged by Daniel Boyarin. In his discussion of this midrashic passage Boyarin places much weight on the midrash's allusion to the verse in Dan 7:9, and suggests that: 38) This point must be emphasized because most of the above quoted discussions of the midrash tend to neglect its own explanation of the difficulty, and instead direct their atten tion to the issue of God's name(s). Arguably, an emphasis on the latter aspect might be seen in the Mekhilta de-Rashbi on Exod 15:3 (ed. Epstein-Melamed [2d ed.; Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1979], 81): "God is a man ofWar (Exod 15:3)—it is He who fought in Egypt, God God is His name, and it is He who fought on the Sea, and it is He who fought on the Jordan river, and He on the Arnon rivers"). The repetition of the words "God is His name" after relating to the fact that God fought in Egypt may be interpreted as expressing the idea that, "The Lord is a man of war" is God's name, that is, His essence. See also jy. Ber. 9a, 12d, 13a. However, it is likely that the words "God is His name" are nothing but a marginal gloss, originally meant to be inserted after the lemma (as they are the continuation of the verse), which, as it frequently happens with such glosses, was inserted into the text in a wrong place. Note that they are not repeated in the rest of the text, as they should have, had the midrash's intention been to express the idea that "The Lord is a man of war" is God's name. Moreover: as was correctly noted by Segal (Two Powers in Heaven, 34; 36), the primary version of the tradition is the one in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael. This is probably true not only for this case but should be taken as the rule. See Menahem I. Kahana, The Two MekhiltotMekhiltot on the Amalek Portion: The Originality of the Version of the Mekhilta d'Rabbi IshmaIshma 'el with Respect to the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shim 'ain;on ben Yohay (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University University Magnes Press, 1999). 351 On the parallels to this theme in the Apocryphon of John and other Gnostic sources, see Guy G. Stroumsa, "Polymorphic divine et transformations d'un mythologeme: TApocryphon de Jean' et ses sources," VC 35 (1981): 412-434. See also A.

Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 245 It is the passage from Daniel that is alluded to, but not cited, in the anti "heretical" discourse, the "Son of Man" passage so pivotal for the develop ment of early Christology, that is the real point of contention here... The problem is the doubling of descriptions of God as senex (judge) and puer (man of war) and the correlation of those two descriptions with the divine figures of Ancient of Days and Son of Man from Daniel, which together might easily lead one to think that there are Two Powers in Heaven, indeed that God has two persons, a Father-person and a Son-person.40 Boyarin's reading attempts to offer an explanation for the midrash's refer ence to the verse in Dan 7:9. In his opinion this reference is, in fact, a midrashic "cover up" for the "true" verse with which the midrash was trou bled, that is, Dan 7:13. The "hidden" allusion to that verse is the real focal point of the text, and, on Boyarin's reading, is the source of the concept of Two Powers.41 This ingenious suggestion, however, requires us to assume that the midrash refers to a verse it does not actually cite (Dan 7:13). In a sense, then, instead of reading the midrash, Boyarin in fact re-writes it. To be 401 Boyarin, "Two Powers in Heaven," 343-44; idem, Border Lines, 135-36; idem, "'He Who Spoke and the World Came to Being': The Logos and Its Rejection, a Chapter in the Formation of the Religion of the Rabbis," in Higayon L'Yona: New Aspects in the Study of Midrash,Midrash, Aggadah and Piyyut In Honor of Professor Yona Fraenkel (ed. Joshua Levinson et al.; Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2006), 159-60 [Hebrew]. 411 To be sure, this approach was suggested already by Segal: "Dan. 7:9 is ostensibly a proof text but is also the locus of the same heretical traditions, since two different figures are mentioned there as well" (Two Powers in Heaven, 37). The first to suggest such a reading was Lauterbach: "The homilist brings three cases in which Scripture relates to different and contradictory appearances [of God], which allow for the mistake that there are two Powers. The first, here at the beginning of the verse "The Lord is a man of war."... The second... in Exod 24:10... The third, in the verses in Dan 7:9-10" (Lauterbach, "Clarifications," 185-87). As brilliant as this suggestion may appear, it does not fit the text's own language and style of argumentation, according to which the verses in this passage are quoted in order to support the midrashs claim that "at Sinai He appeared to them as an old man." As noted above (n. 34), this is precisely the manner by which our midrash is presented by other rabbinic sources. Admittedly, the reference to Exod 24:10b is difficult to understand on this reading (see also below, n. 47), but as noted already by Lewy this reference is a secondary gloss, borrowed from Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Pisha, 14 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 51;51; ed. Lauterbach, 1:113-14), where it fits very well. See J. Lewy, "Ein Wort iiber die 'Mechilta des R. Simeons,"' Jahresbericht des jiidisch-theologischen Seminars, Breslau 1889, 9,9, η. 1. This suggestion was followed by Horovitz in his comments to our passage in his critical edition of the Mekhilta (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 220, note to line 1).</page><page sequence="17">246 A. Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 sure, he is well aware of this point and therefore maintains that: "The text portentously avoids citing the Daniel verses most difficult for rabbinic Judaism, 7:13-14."42 Unfortunately, however, such a conjecture is uncon vincing, as it can neither be proven, nor falsified. Furthermore, Boyarin's interpretation does not account for the most difficult interpretive point in our midrash, namely: if, as indeed seems to be the case, Exod 24:10 is cited by the midrash as a proof that "at Sinai He appeared to them as an old man full of mercy" (precisely as Exod 15:3, "The Lord is a man of war," is cited as a proof that "at the Sea He appeared to them as a hero doing battle"), how then does it actually perform that function?43 How do the words of Exod 24:10 indicate that at Sinai God appeared to the Israelites as an old man, as the midrash claims?44 Segal has suggested that: "The implication of Exod 24:1 la offers a possible answer to the problem. The verse states that God did not lay His hand upon the nobles of the children of Israel. Since the nobles saw God, and since it says elsewhere in Scriptures that no man may see God and live (Exod 33:20), then God must have acted mercifully toward the nobles in not laying His hand upon them."45 But the midrash's claim is not that God was merciful, but rather that He appeared "as an old man full of mercy." The key to this riddle is to be found in the midrashic habit to cite only the first few words of a verse even though the midrash's proof rests in the following words, which are not cited. Accordingly, I suggest that the hom ilist was referring to the following words of Exod 24:10 as well, a verse which he read as follows: "And they saw the Lord of Israel and His under neath, [which appeared to them] as a white Sapphire." That is, the midrash read the verse as saying that the Israelites saw both God and that which was under His feet as a white Sapphire.46 Accordingly, "The Lord of Israel" is said to have been seen as "white," and this indicated to the midrash that He 421 Boyarin, "Two Powers," 344. 431431 Boyarin, ibid., is well aware of the fact that in Exod 24:10, "as the Rabbis read it, God is described as an elder." However, he makes no attempt to explain this rabbinic reading. 441 See again, above, n. 41. 45' Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 44. 461 This reading is based on a punctuation of the verse, which is, obviously, different than the one to which modern readers of the biblical narrative are accustomed, that is: "And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone" (RSV). The midrash punctuated the verse differently, and as a result concluded that both God and that which was under His feet appeared as "sapphire" (= white).</page><page sequence="18">A. Schremer / Journal for the Study offudaism 39 (2008) 230-254 247 appeared as an "old man."47 The function of the citation of Dan 7:9-10, which immediately follows the citation of Exod 24:10, is now understand able: these verses were cited by the midrash to corroborate its understand ing of Exod 24:10. For, in Dan 7:9-10 too God is described as an "old man" (Ancient of Days), "whose garment was white" Admittedly, this interpretation requires the assumption that Dan 7:9-10 was read by our midrash as a reference to the Sinai theophany. Indeed, various facts corroborate this assumption. First, there exists a Targumic tradition that renders God's "glory" (כבודו) of Exod 24:10 as His "throne" (כורסיה), which is explicidy mentioned in Dan 7:9.48 Second, in an ad]a cent passage in the Mekhilta Rabbi Aqiva interprets the words "And all the people witnessed the thunder" (literally: "heard the voices") of Exod 20:15 to mean that: "They saw an utterance of fire coming forth from the mouth of the Mighty."49 This imagery immediately reminds us of the "Fiery stream issued and came forth from before him," of Dan 7:10. We should also take notice of the fact that at the end of the latter verse mention is made of "the books," which "were opened," and this could easily lead one to read these verses in relation specifically to the giving of the Torah at Sinai. This suggestion concerning the function of the citation of Daniel 7:9-10 in our midrash finds strong support in the parallel version in the Mekhilta de-Rashbide-Rashbi on Exod 15:3.50 There, the only proof for the midrash's claim that at Sinai God appeared to the Israelites as an old man is the verse from Dan 7:9, without any mention of Exod 24:10. Although it is possible that this version is secondary and that the omission of Exod 24:10 reflects either a scribal error or a deliberate re-working of the text by the editor, due to the difficulty he may have had in understanding how that verse indicates 471 Other commentators have struggled with the question, how does the midrash prove its claim that God appeared to the Israelites as an old man, and assumed that the midrash based that claim on the clause "And of the time when they were redeemed" etc. For the details of this reading see Lauterbach, "Clarifications," 185-86; Goldin, Song at the Sea, 127; Segal, Two Powers, 40-41; Williams, I am He, 121-22. As was noted by Williams, however, this suggestion necessitates the assumption that the midrash is based primarily on Exod 24:11, which is not cited in the text at all. Indeed, once we realize that this clause is a mere gloss that needs to be omitted from the text (as was noted by Lewy and Horovitz [see above, n. 41]), any reliance on it becomes superfluous. 481 See Onkelos, ad 10c. 491 Mekhilta de-Rabbi IshmaeL, Bahodesh, 9 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 235; ed. Lauterbach, 2:266). 50' Cf. Mekhilta de-Rashbi on Exod 15:3 (ed. Epstein-Melamed, 81).</page><page sequence="19">248 A. Schremer / journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 that at Sinai God was revealed to the Israelites as an old man, it is clear, nevertheless, that he understood the function of the citation of Dan 7:9 as the proof for that contention.51 Once we understand the function of the citation of Dan 7:9-10 as a support for the midrash's claim that at Sinai God was revealed to the peo pie of Israel as and old man, we are not in a need to look for another verse, that is, Dan 7:13 (which is not cited at all by the midrash), in order to explain the midrash's allusion to these verses. And this obviously under mines Boyarin's suggestion to read the midrash as a rabbinic anti-Christian polemic. However, Boyarin's view of the midrash as a reply to a possible Christian "conclusion" from the text of the Hebrew bible does not rest only on his hypothesis concerning the function of the verses from Daniel in the text. It rests, also, on his assumption concerning the identity of "the Nations of the world." Although he is well aware that, "the identity of those who taught that there were two rsurywt [powers] in heaven is uncer tain," and that they could well have been Gnostics,52 he nevertheless claims that: "for this particular text there really is little doubt to whom the refer ence is. The text tells us who its opponents are: "The Nations of the world," 51) This point was correctly observed by Lauterbach ("Clarifications," 187). Since, however, he wished to offer an entirely different interpretation for the midrash he needed to view the presentation of Dan 7:9-10 in the parallel in Mekhilta de-Rashbi as reflecting a misunder standing of the tradition on the part of its editor. See above, n. 34. 521 As was suggested by various scholars. See, for example, Arthur Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Rabbinic Doctrine of God, II: Essays in Anthropomorphism (London: Oxford University Press, 1937), 18; Adolf Biichler, "The Minim ofSepphoris and Tiberias in the Second and Third Centuries," in idem, Studies in Jewish History (ed.

The same holds true in Vayehi, 1, where the Mekh iltailta describes the Egyptians as having said: "Now all the Nations of the world will noise it abroad against us like a bell and will say: Even those who were in their power they had to let go."57 Similarly, in Shirta, 9, the Mekh ilta ilta expounds Exod 15:14, "The peoples have heard," and views it as a reference to the Nations' reaction to the demolition of the Egyptians: "As soon as the Nations of the world saw that Pharaoh and his hosts perished in the Red Sea and that the kingdom of the Egyptians came to an end" etc.58 That "the Nations of the world" is an expression which the Mekhilta uses as a reference to various nations of biblical times is even clearer in Shirta,Shirta, 2, where under this title come: "the generation of the flood"; "the people of the Tower [of Babylon]"; "the people of Sodom"; "the Egyp tians," and other biblical figures.59 In Shirta, 10, "the Nations of the world" are said to have destroyed the Jerusalem Temple,60 and this appears to indi cate that the term is used by the Mekhilta also as a reference to the Roman Empire.61 It is clear, then, that the term "the Nations of the world" in the Mekhilta Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael does not refer specifically to Christians.62 Reading our midrash as a piece of Tannaitic anti-Christian polemic reinforces the notion that Two Powers is a theological stance, which is rooted in a specific interpretation of biblical passages. Furthermore: this reading leads to a specific reconstruction of the concept of Two Powers as what Segal terms "binitarianism." However, as was noted long ago by 57י Ibid., Vayehi Beshalach, 1 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 87; ed. Lauterbach, 1:196). 58, Ibid., Shirta, 9 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 146; ed. Lauterbach, 2:71). 591 Ibid., Shirta, 2 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 121-24; ed. Lauterbach, 2:13-19). 601 Ibid., Shirta, 10 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 150; ed. Lauterbach, 2:79). See also Mekhilta de RashbiRashbi on Exod 15:17 (ed. Epstein-Melamed, 99). 611 611 This usage is evident in other Tannaitic midrashic sources as well. See, for example: Sifre Deuteronomy Deuteronomy §327-28 (ed. Finkelstein, 378); Sifre Deuteronomy §333 (ed. Finkelstein, 382); Mekhilta to Deuteronomy 32:37, MS Yehuda Nahum 242.80. See Kahana, "Pages of the Deuteronomy Mekhilta," 188 (= idem, Genizah Fragments of the Halakhic Midrashim, 354), and his discussion at 171-72. 62) This is the case, in fact, with other Tannaitic compilations as well. Thus, to cite but two examples: if the Sifre Zutta on Num 27:17 (ed. Horovitz, 320) can refer to "the kings of the Nations of the world," it surely does not have Christianity in mind. Similarly, when the Sifre Sifre Deuteronomy § 16 (ed. Finkelstein, 27) refers to the "laws of the Nations of the world," clearly it is not the Christians to whom it refers.</page><page sequence="22">A.

For it suggests that Two Powers was understood by the tradition in the Mekhilta as an expression of chal lenge relating to God's power and sovereignty. Indeed, the pericope in Shirta,Shirta, in which the polemic against Two Powers is found, is followed by a passage that addresses precisely this theme: There may be a hero in a country who is fully equipped with all the imple ments of warfare, but possesses neither strength nor courage, nor the knowl edge of the tactics and the order of warfare. He by whose word the world came into being, however, is not so, but He has strength, courage and knowl edge of the tactics and the order of warfare, as it is said: "For the battle is the Lords and He will give you into our hand" (1 Sam 17:47). And it is written: "A Psalm of David, blessed be the Lord my Rock, who traineth my hands for war and my fingers for battle" (Ps 144:1). There may be a hero in the country, but the strength which he has at the age of forty is not like that which he has at sixty; nor is the strength which he has at sixty the same as at seventy, but as he goes on his strength becomes diminished. He, by whose word the world came into being, however, is not so, but "I the Lord change not" (Mai 3:6). Here the midrash claims that not only does God himself not change, but also that His power does not diminish. The Mekhilta emphasizes that God's strength is still "with him"; he is still full of his power. Therefore, as Judah Goldin put it, by citing the verse from Malachi at the end of this passage the Mekhilta expresses the idea that "I, the Lord, am not unfaith fill,ful, but can always be depended on."64 The pericope in Shirta, as a whole, is comprised, then, of two parts. The first refutes a possible claim that there are Two Powers, the second rejects a possible claim that God's power has diminished. The linkage that the Mekhilta Mekhilta draws between these two issues indicates that, at least on the redactional level they were understood as closely related one to the other. 631 See Shaye J. D. Cohens review of Segal's Two Powers in Heaven, in AJS Review 10 (1978): 116. Mi Goldin, The Song at the Sea, 130, ad "Change not."</page><page sequence="23">252 A. Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 That is, the theological assertion concerning the existence of Two Powers is, in a sense, a variation on the theme of God s powerlessness. How pre cisely? The midrash in the Sifre to Deuteronomy, discussed above, enables us to offer a rationale for this tacit claim. For, as we have seen, both asser tions were understood by Palestinian Rabbis of the Tannaitic era as ema nating from, and as existential reactions to, one and the same historical situation of Israel's military defeat, which was considered as God's defeat. Thus, the treatment of the theme of Two Powers in the Mekhilta turns to be not so far removed from the perspective of the Sifre to Deuteronomy on this theme, which saw Two Powers as an expression of existential reac tion to God's defeat, as exemplified in the destruction of the Second Tem pie. This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that the verb "protest" (מחה), in Rabbi Nathan's saying in the pericope in Bahodesh, is the same very verb put in the mouth of Titus by the Sifre: "If He is really a God let Him come and protest." This fact reveals the deep connection between the two Tannaitic traditions, the one in the Sifre and the one in the Mekhilta, and indicates that in spite of the impression one is left with after a first reading of the latter, the two are governed by one and the same perspective. Conclusion Two Powers, as most other theological stances related to by early rabbinic literature, is usually treated by scholars from a theological perspective. As a result, scholars tend to view the rabbinic polemic against the assertion that there are "two Powers in heaven" as relating to its truth value. The Rabbis, on this common understanding, rejected the concept ofTwo Powers because they considered it as theologically false. Their polemic against it is under stood and presented as reflecting an interest in determining "correct" belief, that is, as part of the rabbinic effort to establish a notion of orthodoxy. In contrast to this approach I have drawn attention to the association made by Tannaitic sources between the assertion that there are Two Powers and the assertion that there is no God, or that God lost His power. The joint treatment of these assertions indicates that the Rabbis were not inter ested in each one of them because of its distinctive theological content. Rather, the Rabbis looked at these assertions through the lenses of their common foundation, from which they were understood to have stemmed: an existential stance of disloyalty to God, and an existential qualm con cerning His divinity. The rabbinic polemic, accordingly, was not aimed at contesting the truth value of each one of these theological assertions.</page><page sequence="24">A. Schremer / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 230-254 253 Instead, it was directed against the common foundation upon which they rested, which was understood by the Rabbis as an existential crisis. The earliest rabbinic sources suggest a specific historical context for the emergence of this existential crisis: Rabbi Nehemiahs identification of the enemy with Titus, and the Sifres presentation of God's declaration, "See now that I, even I, am He," as a reply to Titus' provocative claim, "If He is really a god let Him come and protest," indicate that in the eyes of the Rabbis the doubts concerning God's potency were a result of the destruc tion of the Second Temple and the Jews' defeat in their wars against the Roman Empire. This suggests that the early rabbinic treatment of Two Powers, indeed the entire early rabbinic discourse of minut (of which Two Powers is but one aspect), is a response to a religious and existential crisis, which befell Palestinian Jews in the wake of the destruction of the Second Temple. This contextualization, which is suggested by the early rabbinic tradi tion itself, undermines much of hitherto scholarship's efforts to identify the specific "religious school," as it were, which Two Powers was assumed to be representing. It turns that Two Powers was not conceived of by Palestinian Rabbis as a theologoumenon characteristic of any specific group—either Christianity, as suggested by some scholars, or Gnosticism, as maintained by others. Rather it was understood as an existential response of despair, to what appeared to be God's refraining from revealing His power. It is tempting to go even a step farther. Since the claims concerning God's weakness are associated with the triumph of the Roman Empire and its power, it would not be out of place to note that Rome's victories were perceived by the Romans themselves as a manifestation of the victories of their gods.65 And in that period the personification of Rome's god was no other than the Roman Emperor.66 Necessarily, then, doubting God's power and existence entailed the affirmation of the divinity of the Emperor. It is not a mere coincidence, therefore, that the issue of the exaltation of the 65י See Herr, "Persecutions and Martyrdom," 115-16; John R.
