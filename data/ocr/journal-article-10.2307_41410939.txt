Although this area is usually included in the west, it can be more productively viewed as an interface, the physical space where people, goods, and ideas passed from one side to the other, and thus it holds many keys for our understanding of emerging social complexity in Mesoamerica. In reviewing the last two decades of Formative period (1500 BC-AD 100) research in this crucial ter- ritory, we focus on themes that reveal the variation and dynamism of interregional interaction, including the formation of regional traditions, exchange systems, and foreign "influence," and others that help contextualize the events and processes of that time, like household studies and environmental degradation. We stress that this part of Mexico is undergoing relentless development so time is of the essence if we are to broaden our perspectives on social evolution in the Central Highlands. This issue cannot be resolved by rescue and salvage work because it requires long-term, interdisciplinary projects to unravel multifaceted problems. Keywords Mesoamerica • Formative period • Social complexity • Interregional interaction Introduction The Central Highlands of Mexico cover some 50,000 km2 on either side of the Transverse Neo volcanic Axis that runs along the 19th parallel; it includes the modern states of Mexico, Tlaxcala, and Morelos, in addition to southern Hidalgo, central Puebla, and the Federal District (Fig. 1) (Cowgill 2000, p. 250; P.

The Basin of Mexico lies at the heart of this territory, with the high Valley of Toluca on the west and the open expanse of Puebla- Tlaxcala to the east. The broad, dry plains of the Mezquital and Tulancingo valleys extend to the north, while to the south, in Morelos and Puebla, rests the first tier (between 1000-1600 m) of the escarpment that drains the waters of the Mesa Central into the Balsas River system (Charlton 2000, pp. 507-509). The entire region is a land of recent volcanoes and the products of their activity, including cinder cones, obsidian and lava flows, and the fertile soils that for thousands of years have supported dense populations. With the exception of the southern escarpment, much of its surface is covered with flat-floored basins - remnants of ancient Pleistocene lakes that have all but disappeared - ranging between 1400 and 2600 m above sea level (West 1964, pp. 41-^8). This article reviews the past 20 years of archaeological research on the Formative (1500 ВС- AD 100) - an era in many ways comparable to the Old World Neolithic (Marcus 2008) - within the Central Highlands. Twentieth-century studies focused heavily on the Basin of Mexico, but as ancient remains have disappeared under road construction and housing projects, researchers have moved into neighboring zones in an attempt to answer still-pressing questions. These adjacent regions, however, also are undergoing relentless development, making investigation increasingly difficult as sites are destroyed and social problems disrupt fieldwork. In 2007, Basin of Mexico scholars began discussing ways of conserving archaeological resources and sharing databases so that existing information can be ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20: 1-51 3 used to address new and unanticipated topics; they concluded that future field research must privilege endangered sites while funding for work at protected zones be restricted (Robertson and Gorenflo 2008). The concerns expressed for the Basin of Mexico need to be applied to the entire Central Highlands as new oil refineries, superhighways, industrial parks, low-cost housing tracts, and other infrastructure projects strain the nation's ability to study and preserve its prehispanic patrimony. Rescue and salvage archaeology has produced Formative period data sets for the Central Highlands - especially records of burials, ceramics, and figurines - but for the most part only special finds or preliminary analyses have been published (e.g., Castillo et al. 1993; David et al. 2007; Gámez 1993, 1995, 1997; Lechuga and Rivas 1994; López Wario 1993; Pulido 1993; Rodríguez 1993; Torres 1997). More complete descriptions can be found in numerous Licenciatura or Masters theses (e.g., Aranda 1996; Badillo 2005; Gámez 1989; García 1991; Meraz 2009; Platas 2001; Rivera 2008; Rodríguez 1994; Rodríguez Ic 2003; Sereno 2007). However, like the hundreds of technical reports submitted to the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) every year, there is no permanent venue for the publication of this information, making it difficult to incorporate this expanding corpus into archaeological reconstructions and discussions. So although our primary objective is to review thematic trends in planned investigation projects, we also include some consideration of the rescue and salvage work that has become increasingly important as urban sprawl covers more and more of the area (e.g., Salazar 1998). Here we use the term Formative, rather than Preclassic, to refer to the Mesoamerican Neolithic. Preclassic is an older designation that emphasizes a long period of Olmec influence in its middle subdivision (1250-400 ВС) (Porter Weaver 1981, p. 57), while Formative was introduced in the 1960s to better reflect changes in material culture (Grove 2007a, p. 213). There are a number of variations on exactly how the Formative should be subdivided (e.g., Evans 2004; Grove 2000a, p. 514, fig. 2) and when transitions take place (depending on the use of radiocarbon or sidereal time, and whether or not calibrated dates are employed). We do not intend to present a chronological discussion here. Based on several sources (e.g., Lesure et al. 2006; Niederberger 2000, p. 172, table I; Pool 2007, p. 7, fig. 1.4; Sanders et al. 1979, p. 93, table 5.1), we divide the sequence in sidereal time as follows: Early (1500-900 ВС), Middle (900-500 BC), Late (500-100 ВС), and Terminal (100 BC-AD 100). We proceed according to these subdivisions, concentrating on certain themes that consistently appear in the literature, such as foreign "influences," the formation of regional traditions, the development of social complexity, exchange systems, environmental degradation, and domestic life. Background The basic framework for the Formative period in the Central Highlands was developed during the first half of the 20th century in the Basin of Mexico, where excavations at Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, El Arbolillo, Zacatenco, Ticomán, and Cuicuilco provided data for an initial ceramic chronology and general reconstructions of Ö Springer</page><page sequence="4">4 J Archaeol Res (201 2) 20: 1-5 1 culture history (e.g., Barba 1956; Cummings 1933; Gamio 1921; Piña Chan 1955a, 1958a, b; Porter 1953; Vaillant 1930, 1931, 1935). Areas beyond the Basin were virtually unknown with the exception of limited excavations along the southern escarpment at Guai upita (Vaillant and Vaillant 1934) and Chalcatzingo (Piña Chan 1955b) in Morelos, or occasional finds of Olmec-style objects at such sites as Las Bocas (Grove 2000a) and Tepatlaxco in Puebla (Coe 1965, figs. 8, 11) and Atlihuayán in Morelos (Piña Chan and López 1952). Most exploration was restricted to stratigraphie pits or trenches, and publications generally dealt with typologies that were used to distinguish cultural traditions, establish developmental stages, and identify sources of foreign influence (e.g., Piña Chan 1971). However, a significant misconstruction of the chronological sequence, which conflated Zacatenco sites with Tlatilco, led to the view that an Olmec-style-bearing elite colonized a territory already occupied by simple farmers (Co varrubias 1950). As Niederberger (2000, p. 171) pointed out, this created a major confusion that still impinges to a certain extent on the archaeology of the Central Highlands in spite of the now well-established temporal placement of Tlatilco in the Early and Zacatenco in the Middle Formative. Between 1960 and 1990, as archaeologists adopted ecological approaches and shied away from the migration and "influence" arguments that dominated pre- 1960s discussions, settlement pattern surveys in the Basin of Mexico and neighboring areas of Morelos, Puebla, and the State of Mexico began to provide data that could be used to generate population estimates and reconstruct sociopolitical integration as it changed through time (e.g., Garcia Cook 1976, 1981; González 1999; Hirth 1987; McBride 1974; Parsons 1971; Plunket 1998; Precourt 1983; Sanders et al. 1979; Tschohl 1977; Tschohl and Nickel 1972). These surveys shifted the discourse on the Formative away from culture history towards process-oriented interpretations and allowed scholars to consider a more complete sample of sites for each time period. With few exceptions (e.g., Grove 1987; Manzanilla 1985; Tolstoy 1989), however, the extensive excavation of these sites dramatically lagged behind their identification from surface remains. Chronology and typology continued to dominate the literature, and both Tolstoy and Paradis (1970) and Niederberger (1976, 1987) made exceptionally important contributions that have facilitated comparisons of ceramic materials within Formative Meso- america and demonstrated that the differences between Tlatilco and Zacatenco were temporal and not necessarily due to the arrival of a foreign elite in the land of backwards peasants. Interest in early villages and domestic life began during the late 1960s and 1970s with Flannery's (1976) work in Oaxaca and Grove's (1974b, 1987) excavations in Morelos. Following their lead, other researchers undertook the horizontal exposure of residential architecture in order to document the development of social inequality, community organization, and sociopolitical hierarchy in addition to subsistence activities (e.g., Manzanilla 1986; Sanders et al. 1979, pp. 305-334; Santley 1993; Serra 1986). Hirth (1984) and others sought to explore Formative period exchange relationships associated with the emergence of social complexity and, ultimately, supplied the connective tissue that bound Mesoamerica's distinctive regions into an interacting whole. Springer</page><page sequence="5">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 5 Most summaries of the Central Highlands during the Formative concentrate on individual subregions, reflecting the difficulty of generalizing about this vast territory, which is characterized by a high degree of variation not only in geology and landscape but also in climate, rainfall patterns, and resources. Grove (1968, 1974a, 1981, 2000a, b) has provided the most comprehensive overviews, but even these excellent syntheses tend to focus on the Basin of Mexico and Morelos, leaving Puebla, Tlaxcala, and the Valley of Toluca on the sidelines. The rationale behind this selectivity surely has to do with how well both fieldwork and analyses have been published (or not), since as rescue and salvage archaeology has taken over as the principal mode of investigation in the center of Mexico, less and less research appears in published form. For the first half of the Formative (until 500 ВС), subregions and sites producing Olmec-style materials frequently are discussed in general works and textbooks on ancient Mesoamerica, while areas and settlements that lack these expressions are more often than not ignored (Grove 2007a). A review of the literature reveals that many of the relevant publications on the Central Highland Formative appear in volumes designed to explore Olmec interaction outside the Gulf Coast (e.g., Benson and de la Fuente 1996; Clark and Pye 2000; Grove and Joyce 1999; Pool 2006, 2007; Sharer and Grove 1989), and that a marked imbalance exists between the number of articles available on this zone and others (however, see Cyphers and Hirth 2008). Indeed, in a recent volume on Formative Mesoamerica (Powis 2005), only one of the 17 chapters deals with central Mexico. In addition, there are few summations of the entire Central Highlands for this time period, and readers must search out articles on individual sites and subregions in order to construct their own synthesis. Just as the "Olmec problem" has been an all-consuming passion for those interested in the first half of the Formative, the remainder of the period is viewed through the prism of Teotihuacan, and with few exceptions, it is treated mostly as a backdrop for the development of urban society (e.g., Angulo 2007). Even though it experienced major demographic expansion and remarkable sociopolitical transfor- mations, it has yet to receive the same kind of attention as the Early and Middle segments. The Basin of Mexico projects noted that the relatively slow Early Formative population growth contrasts sharply with the dramatic increases of subsequent centuries, a change attributed to an intensifying commitment to storable cultigens like beans, maize, and amaranth (Sanders 1981, pp. 164-165). The beginning ofthat demographic upsurge also roughly coincides with the significant Middle Formative stylistic shift that Niederberger (2000, p. 172, table I) labeled "deculturation" as the use of early Olmec-style iconography at Tlapacoya and Tlatilco disappeared (Tetelpan phase, 950-880 ВС), suggesting significant political and economic changes that initiated a prolonged period of escalating complexity. Surveys in all of the major Central Highland valley (e.g., Castanzo 2002; Garcia Cook 1981; Hirth 1980, 1987; Plunket 1998; Sanders et al. 1979; Tschohl 1977; Tschohl and Nickel 1972), except the Valley of Toluca, which saw a huge population decline after 400 ВС and was almost entirely abandoned by the end of the first century ВС (González 1999, pp. 73-74), establish the latter half of the Formative as one of the most Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">6 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20: 1-51 dynamic periods in Mesoamerican prehistory, witnessing the establishment of regional chiefdoms with significant public architecture and, ultimately, an expansionistic urban state at Teotihuacan. Fortunately, Late and Terminal Formative period studies have expanded during the last two decades, particularly in the Puebla-Tlaxcala area (Plunket and Uruñuela 2005), broadening our knowledge on key topics such as social inequality, conflict, trade, religion and ritual practice, storage, household and community organization, and chronology. The Early Formative No key data on the beginning of the Formative period have been published during the past 20 years, but researchers have continued to explore the "Olmec problem" and its implications for Early Formative interaction. The destruction of archaeo- logical habitats has rendered sites from this time period a truly endangered species, however, and thus, in the Basin of Mexico at least, work has focused mostly on reassessments of existing data, highlighting the importance of conserving collec- tions and information for the future. Tolstoy's (1989) réévaluation of Coapexco and Tlatilco established that some of the earliest ceramic sites in the Basin were not simple autonomous egalitarian villages but rather settlements with populations above 1,000 covering over 40 ha (however, see Grove 2007a, p. 219) that exhibited some internal differentiation, participation in long-distance exchange, and evidence of specialized obsidian production. Since then, scholars have begun to reexamine the archaeological record in search of the material diagnostics of social segmen- tation, long-distance trade, ranking, and political hierarchy in order to map in greater detail the course of social evolution in the Central Highlands. Other sites important for the following discussion are Tlapacoya in the southeastern Basin of Mexico, Chalcatzingo and Las Bocas along the southern escarpment, and Moyotzingo, Tetel, and Amomoloc in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley. In his analysis of 375 of Tlatilco' s 500 subfloor residential interments excavated between 1942 and 1969, Tolstoy (1989) considered variations in contents, depth, position, and orientation to identify indicators of social rank, age, and sex. Based on differences in body orientation, he suggested that the community was divided into two intermarrying matrilineal groups, and that while Olmec-style materials occurred with about 50% of the earliest skeletons, they did not seem to be associated with wealth (Tolstoy 1989, pp. 117-119). After the catalog for the last field season at Tlatilco was published (Garcia Moll et al. 1991), Joyce (1999) used this and Tolstoy's analysis to further explore patterning in the mortuary practices. She interprets Tlatilco as a Levi-Straussian-type house society (see Gillespie 2000) that lacked a true central authority and argues that the burial clusters represent internally ranked, competing residential groups. Thus differences in practices between rival houses, and not the personal status of the dead, might account for the variation in grave goods even though costume was important in distinguishing prominent individuals within each house (Joyce 1999, pp. 15, 22). Obsidian production was emphasized in the funerary furniture of two clusters, perhaps signaling the social recognition of this craft, which may have played a key role in the growth of social ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 7 inequality within the settlement (Joyce 1999, pp. 34-38). Joyce (2001) also has focused on Tlatilco's female burials, looking at how residential groups used mortuary practice to construct social identity and collective memory. Her discourse moves from statistical data describing the community's structural regularities to reconstructions of the lives of selected women - reflected in the treatment they were given at death - as she seeks insights into the variable experience of being female in Tlatilco's Early Formative, and perhaps matrilineal, house society. In both studies, Joyce demonstrates the value of exploring existing catalogs and collections, especially those that are large enough for statistical analyses and rich enough to supply experiential details of individual life cycles. Mother and sisters In this article, "Olmec" and "Olmec-style" refer to the pan-Mesoamerican Early and Middle Formative art style that traditionally has been called "Olmec" or "Olmecoid" since it was first associated with Gulf Coast cultures; we use these terms merely as common references, without any implications as to origin or ethnic affiliation. The on-going debate over the Olmec as "mother" or "sister" cultures (Blomster et al. 2005a; Flannery and Marcus 2000; Flannery et al. 2005; Hancock et al. 2008; Lesure 2004; Neff et al. 2006a, b; Sharer et al. 2006; Stark 2007; Stoltman et al. 2005) has resulted in methodological deliberations on how to develop reliable data sets that can advance our understanding of what the presence (or absence) of this style and its variations in different parts of Mesoamerica actually means in terms of human interaction. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of 725 samples from both highland and lowland sites, including 129 sherds from Tlapacoya, was used to identify the clay sources of pottery bearing "Olmec" iconography; the results suggest that the Basin of Mexico, like other areas, imported San Lorenzo white and/ or gray wares decorated with "Olmec" motifs, which were then copied and integrated into local practice (Blomster et al. 2005a). Blomster and his colleagues (2005b) posit that Tlapacoya imported little Olmec-style pottery - only 15% of the site's selected INAA sample shows a Gulf Coast origin - and did not export its own iconograph- ically embellished wares to other areas. Stoltman and others (2005, p. 11213) have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that INAA identifies only chemical elements that can occur in different parent materials; they argue that ceramic provenience studies should preferably rely on pétrographie analysis, which identifies minerals, not elements, and can thus demonstrate a geological link between vessel paste and homeland bedrock. Pétrographie analysis of a small sample of sherds has identified Oaxacan grayware at Tlapacoya and Moyotzingo (Puebla), and Tlapacoyan ceramics at San José Mogote in Oaxaca (Niederberger 1976, pp. 1 12-142; Stoltman et al. 2005, p. 11217), indicating at least a nominal ceramic exchange between the Central Highlands and the Valley of Oaxaca. Tlapacoya is only one of several sites with Olmec-style materials in the Central Highlands, and without a consideration of ceramics from Tlatilco, Moyotzingo, Colotzingo, Coapexco, Las Bocas, and others, the provenience studies remain inconclusive regarding the nature of Early Formative interaction. To complicate matters, the clandestine market for "Olmec-style" pieces â Springer</page><page sequence="8">8 J Archaeol Res (201 2) 20: 1-5 1 has led dealers, collectors, and museums to assign a Las Bocas, Tlapacoya, or Tlatilco origin to artifacts of unknown provenience - including many fakes - to boost value. Although ideally both the pétrographie approach and INAA should be applied to materials from many more Early Formative sites, the published results would be more useful if they included copious illustrations of the specific style elements so that scholars could better understand the distinctions between local and imported wares in different regions. Additionally, before we conclude that the "Olmec-style" is more common in one area than another, we should consider the context of the materials displaying this imagery within each site. Imported pottery may be more prevalent in some discard situations than in others. Middens and fill may not faithfully represent the frequency of exotic vessels at a site, particularly if they were favored as grave goods for selected individuals. One major difference between Tlapacoya and Tlatilco, for example, is that only one disturbed secondary Early Formative multiple burial has been recorded at Tlapacoya (Manantial phase, 1250-950 ВС [Niederberger 1976, p. 237]), whereas so many graves were encountered at Tlatilco that it was originally interpreted as a cemetery. Their ceramic assemblages are also quite different in both contents and frequencies. Recent analysis of pottery excavated at the celebrated "Olmec" site of Las Bocas, where just one burial (lacking Olmec-style offerings) was found, shows that the "Olmecoid" group represents only about 2.4% of the total sherds recovered from all Early and Middle Formative stratigraphie levels (Paillés and Velazquez 2008, p. 72, gráfica 2), much less than might be expected from a site with such an outstanding presence in museums and private collections. Thus any proposal that one site has more imports than another, without considering the variations in context, will not necessarily reflect the reality of their frequency, and without paste studies archaeologists will often err in their judgments. As Joyce (1999) has demonstrated, any analysis that seeks to understand intra- and intercommunity interaction needs to specifically consider how and where traded goods were being employed - and we might add, discarded- within each site. In another study, to establish the source of Olmec-style motifs, Blomster (2002) turned to the hollow "baby face" figurines from the Gulf and Pacific coasts, the Valley of Oaxaca, the Mixteca Alta, and the Basin of Mexico. He divided a corpus of 40 "intact" examples into two groups: (1) white-slipped Olmec-style figures that combine infantile and adult features, and (2) a more heterogeneous assemblage of unslipped or brown-slipped variations. Based on the greater variability within his Group 2 and deviations from his definition of the "Olmec-style," Blomster (2002, p. 192) concludes that Group 1 figurines were exported from San Lorenzo to other areas where they then served as models for the regional styles expressed in his Group 2. However, 35 of the 40 figurines lack reliable provenience and chronological data, making them of questionable utility in a distributional study. Thus it seems premature to conclude that all "Olmec-style" objects were imported into the highlands from the Gulf Coast without paste analysis and the addition of more samples from excavated contexts. Nonetheless, Blomster' s article is another example of how the Early Formative in the Central Highlands has become an â Springer</page><page sequence="9">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 9 accessory to understanding Gulf Coast Olmec rather than a subject of primary interest in and of itself. With the exception of Coapexco (Tolstoy 1989), San Pablo (Grove 1974b), and Chalcatzingo (Grove 1987), stone architecture has not been documented for the Early Formative in Mexico's Central Highlands. In 1995, Avilés (2000) explored one of the two stone-faced Amate (1500-1100 ВС) phase platform mounds at Chalcatzingo (Prindi ville and Grove 1987, p. 65), and although the final results are still pending, the excavations revealed a 1.5-m-high, multistage construction measuring at least 5.5 m x 3 m, which might have been an elite residence or a public building. Additionally, an Early Formative house floor was found in one test pit; greenstone fragments and an iron-ore mirror associated with the floor suggest that it belonged to an elite residence, but no indications of domestic activity or subfloor burials were located. These initial findings from Chalcatzingo' s Early Formative architecture imply a certain degree of social inequality during the site's original occupation. Recently, Paillés (2008a) reported low clay platforms and possibly stone terraces or basal platforms for residential structures at Las Bocas for this time period, although the size and distribution of the buildings remains unclear. Existing data and analyses suggest to us that the Early Formative in the Central Highlands, and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, witnessed the emergence of segmental societies engaging in alliance formation in order to avoid violent confrontations (see Kelly 2005) as trading ventures that sought to secure exotic localized materials, such as obsidian, greenstone, shell, and iron ore, started to criss-cross the territories of different groups. Gulf Coast societies appear to have been heavily involved in this early diplomacy, which probably required the procurement and production of prestige goods for ritualized gift exchange but not the erection of carved stone monuments since these do not occur at highland sites. Yet little attention has been paid to the traditions of other segmental societies, particularly those that produced the Tlatilco style, which, as Grove (2006, 2007a, pp. 216-219) points out, shows strong ties to western Mesoamerica. Tlatilco culture is present in Morelos prior to the advent of Olmec motifs, and Grove (2007a, p. 218) submits that it first developed there along the southern escarpment and not in the Basin of Mexico. Perhaps because it is less iconographically enhanced than the "Olmec" materials, the Tlatilco style, characterized by red-on-brown bottles, stirrup-spout vessels, resist decoration, solid D2 and К figurines, and hollow DK figures (Grove 2007a, p. 216), has been largely ignored in recent discussions of the Early Formative. Grove's proposal would explain why both Tolstoy (1989) and Niederberger (1987, pp. 263, 607, 616-621) found that the use of the San Lorenzo Olmec style is a bit earlier in the Basin of Mexico than the Tlatilco style; hence, we need to map the chronology and distribution of each tradition to understand its individual role in the communities where it occurs. Paillés (2008b, p. 163) has found no evidence of Tlatilco culture at Las Bocas, but a trace occurs at Colotzingo in the Atlixco Valley (Uruñuela 1998) and is associated with the first stone-faced architecture at Chalcatzingo, in addition to its significant presence in funerary contexts in the Basin of Mexico. More work on this phenomenon will be required before we begin to comprehend the Early Formative societies of the Central Highlands. â Springer</page><page sequence="10">10 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20: 1-5 1 First farmers Grove (1970, 2007a) has long held that the Formative lifestyle emerged in the warm, humid valleys on the southern escarpment in Morelos before it appeared in the higher elevations of the Basin of Mexico. After surveying most of the Basin, Sanders and his co-authors (1979, p. 95) speculated that Coapexco, located just above the pass between the Basin and Morelos in the Ajusco range, may represent the initial colonization by farmers from lower altitudes. Recent studies have established the primacy of the Balsas River basin in the hot country south of the Central Highlands for the domestication of maize (Piperno et al. 2009; Ziziumbo- Villarreal and Colunga-García Marín 2010). These findings, in addition to the increasing presence of Granular White ceramics - imported from or inspired by Guerrero farming communities - at higher elevations in Morelos and the Basin of Mexico throughout the Formative period (Padilla 2009, pp. 107-1 11), point to north and central Guerrero as one possible source for expanding agricultural groups (Lesure 2008). Future research needs to better integrate Guerrero archaeology into our considerations of Formative beginnings in central Mesoamerica. In 2000, Lesure initiated research in Tlaxcala to further explore the Archaic- Formative transition in the Central Highlands. Tlaxcala was a key area for this study since Garcia Cook's (1981, p. 245; Garcia Cook and Merino 2005, p. 587) survey had identified 18 Early Formative (Tzompantepec phase, 1600-1200 ВС) hamlets with mixed agricultural/foraging economies. Lesure' s concern was to examine the degree to which emerging farming lifestyles may have involved a number of independent transitions from foraging to agriculture in different areas or the colonization of uninhabited territories by expanding populations from nuclear farming zones; an additional objective was to explore the relation between subsistence and sedentism (Lesure et al. 2006, pp. 474-475). In order to answer two questions, Lesure focused on two previously identified Early Formative sites, Tetel and Amomoloc, located on lands marginal for maize agriculture near Apizaco, where studies in the 1970s (Erffa et al. 1977; Lauer 1979) indicated the presence of ancient lake systems: (1) Was the early dating suggested by Garcia Cook and Merino (1989) correct? (2) If so, were these communities indeed agricultural or did they belong to a sedentary Archaic lacustrine tradition like that identified by Niederberger (1976) at Zohapilco in the Basin of Mexico (Lesure et al. 2006, p. 476)? The analysis of ceramics recovered from bell-shaped pits and a suite of radiocarbon dates from these features at both sites led Lesure et al. (2006, p. 482) to propose a radical chronological change in the established Tlaxcala sequence, correlating the Tzompantepec phase with the Basin of Mexico's Tetelpan phase (950-880 ВС [Niederberger 2000, p. 172, table 1]). In essence, Lesure and his colleagues have almost eliminated the Early Formative occupation from Tlaxcala' s chronological sequence. Additionally, his project's environmental research and faunal analysis found little evidence of lake systems and virtually no exploitation of lacustrine resources; however, maize cobs, kernels, and cupules that are morphologically similar to contemporary remains from the Basin of Mexico were recovered from both Tetel and Amomoloc (Lesure et al. 2006, pp. 485-488). Thus Lesure concludes that the original Formative occupation of Tlaxcala was part â Springer</page><page sequence="11">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 11 of a generalized colonization of the more agriculturally marginal zones of the Central Highlands by expanding farming populations from lower elevations, in agreement with both Grove's and Sanders' views mentioned above (see Lesure 2008). Although they are now dated to the transition between the Early and Middle Formative, the first farming hamlets and villages in Tlaxcala were believed to be associated with residential and cultivation stone-faced terraces (Garcia Cook 1981, pp. 245-246) and water management systems (Abascal 1980; Abascal and García Cook 1975), consonant with small-scale Middle Formative irrigation systems described for the Basin of Mexico (Nichols 1982, 1987), Morelos (Grove and Cyphers Guillén 1987; Nichols et al. 2006, p. 59), and the Puebla Valley (Fowler 1987). Nichols (1982, 1987) found that piedmont erosion in the northern Basin of Mexico resulted from clearing for planting during the initial Middle Formative colonization, and she suggests that small-scale irrigation quickly developed as a means of reducing climatic risk in the semiarid highlands, thus creating a number of productive, lower-risk niches within a generally high-risk environment. Yet Heine (2003, pp. 237-238, 240) has recently published evidence of accelerated human- induced soil erosion between 700 ВС and AD 100 in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley that became particularly severe during the Late Formative when large areas were stripped down to resistant indurated horizons (tepetate), which suggests that many communities did not practice soil conservation techniques. Borejsza's (2006; Borejsza et al. 2008, p. 1863) excavations of terrace systems at the Middle through Terminal Formative La Laguna site in northeastern Tlaxcala failed to identify evidence of agricultural terraces prior to the Postclassic; indeed, his analysis and 14C dating of the interbedded sand, mud, charcoal, and ash fill from an abandoned channel exposed in the Barranca Xilomantla in central Tlaxcala suggest the burning of secondary growth on fallowed slopes in preparation for renewed cultivation during the Terminal Formative, perhaps providing support for the extensive Formative period tlacolol farming that archaeologists have had so much trouble documenting. Masonry walls at La Laguna were not used for cultivation terraces but to create flat ground for residences and other architectural complexes (Borejsza 2006, p. 450). Agricultural terraces consistently rest on top of sterile erosional unconformities and were built during the Postclassic or later to reclaim farmland degraded by the bush-fallow systems of the Formative and Classic (Borejsza 2006, p. 450). By the Terminal Formative, however, piedmont farmers at sites like Tetimpa in Puebla were digging drainage channels and mounding earth around their corn plants to create fields with long linear furrows running perpendicular to the slopes in order to avoid severe erosion (Aguirre 2000; López 2000, 2006). The erosion caused by hillside swidden agriculture during the latter part of the Formative contrasts with the implementation of hydraulic technology at settlements on the valley floor such as Amalucan, where swampy areas were intermittently drained and irrigated as early as 700 ВС (Fowler 1987). It is unclear just how widespread these kinds of waterworks were during Formative times, but at Cholula drainage canals first appear in association with Early Classic materials (López et al. 2004). ö Springer</page><page sequence="12">12 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 Bridging east and west Researchers in West Mexico have sometimes quipped that if Olmec was Mesoamerica's mother culture, then West Mexico must have been the father. Grove (2006, 2007a, b, 2009) argues that connections between the Central Highlands and West Mexico, particularly Michoacán and Colima, were crucial to the development of "Tlatilco culture." He suggests that the Basin of Mexico constituted a major east-west divide for Mesoamerica, with the "gateway" to the western Tlatilco tradition on one side of the lake system and the "gateway" to the eastern Tlapacoya culture on the other (Grove 2007b). Even though western ceramic forms and decoration are present in the Basin and along the southern escarpment during the Early Formative, no one has sourced any of the resistwares or stirrup- spout and cinctured bottles to see if they might be imports. Yet the identification of significant amounts of Zinapécuaro/Ucareo obsidian (Boksenbaum et al. 1987) in the Basin during this time period should alert us that our preoccupation with Mesoamerica's "mother culture" has blinded us from testing its paternity. The Central Highlands were probably more important as a crossroads than a watershed, however, and the overlap of materials, motifs, and styles indicates that local populations took advantage of the multiple opportunities to form connections with both east and west. But we still need to identify and characterize local traditions in the areas surrounding the Basin of Mexico to move beyond the "Olmec problem" as the major frame for inquiry and consider not only what highland communities imitated or reinterpreted but also what they created. The Middle Formative Although Chalcatzingo, Tlapacoya, and other early sites also have significant Middle Formative occupations, settlements like Cuicuilco and Temamatla in the Basin of Mexico and Tlalancaleca and Xochitécatl in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley emerge as key polities during this time. One of the more recent discoveries in the Central Highlands reinforces our belief that we still have a lot to learn about the first half of the Formative and the nature of lowland-highland interaction. In 2006, construction on the west side of the Autopista del Sol about 16 km south of Cuernavaca in western Morelos came upon Middle Formative structural remains at Zazacatla. Excavations uncovered large platforms faced with horizontally placed limestone slabs, occasionally forming V-shaped panels and niches, in an architectural tradition similar to Chalcatzingo in eastern Morelos and Teopa- ntecuanitlán in Guerrero (Fig. 2); at Zazacatla, however, several of the niches contained carved-stone figures with a marked resemblance to Gulf Coast statuary, especially San Lorenzo monuments 10 and 52 and La Venta monuments 8 and 10 (Canto and Castro 2007; Pérez de Lara 2007). Based on ceramics and architecture, Canto and Castro (2010) date the main occupation of Zazacatla between 800 and 500 ВС. The discovery suggests that Chalcatzingo and Teopantecuanitlán might not be as unique as we thought and, indeed, may have formed part of a broader Olmec- related Middle Formative tradition occupying the southern escarpment of the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 13 Fig. 2 V-shaped clefts, a Chalcatzingo altar measuring 4.4 m wide x 1 m high (modified from Fash 1987, p. 84, fig. 7.4). b Eastern platform at Zazacatla measuring 22.9 m long, with walls conserved to a maximum of 1 .5 m (based on photo by Pérez de Lara 2007). с Detail of eastern platform at Zazacatla (based on photo by Pérez de Lara 2007). d Platform at Teopantecuanitlán Central Highlands and the route into the hot lowlands of the Balsas Basin and on to the shores of the Pacific for the procurement of shell, greenstone, and cinnabar (Niederberger 2002). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="14">14 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 In general, stone-faced platforms are not well documented at highland sites during the Middle Formative. Over 30 years ago Garcia Cook (1981, pp. 252-253) placed most of Tlalancaleca's monumental buildings in this period, and he envisioned this as evidence for the emergence of a priestly class of merchant-rulers and the generalized formation of small, economically specialized theocratic states. However, the 1973 excavations at Tlalancaleca consisted of surface collections and 20 test pits, which produced approximately equal amounts of Middle and Late Formative ceramics and a series of radiocarbon dates that cluster in the first centuries of the Late Formative (Montaño 1998, pp. 20-30). Serra's (1998a; Serra and Lazcano 2008; Serra and Palavacini 1996) excavations at Xochitécatl in Tlaxcala indicate that the initial construction of three ceremonial buildings (Edificio de la Espiral, Edificio de la Serpiente, and Pirámide de las Flores) situated around an artificial plaza may date as early as 700 ВС, although it is more likely that they were built early in the Late Formative. Serra (Ramírez et al. 2000, pp. 29-31) also has documented stone-faced platforms at Temamatla in the southern Basin of Mexico and notes similarities between them and Middle Formative Structure 1 on Terrace 6 at Chalcatzingo; she suggests that like Chalcatzingo, Temamatla' s elite residence was associated with ceremonial architecture. Other sites in Puebla-Tlaxcala, like Colotzingo (Uruñuela 1989, 1998), Coapan (Tschohl and Nickel 1972; Uruñuela n.d.), Totimehuacan (Spranz 1970), Xochiltenago (Castanzo 2002), Cuauhtinchan (Seiferle- Valencia 2007), and Cholula (Noguera 1956) probably initiated the construction of small stone-faced platforms during the Middle Formative, but for the most part the buildings of this time are covered by Late and Terminal Formative occupations. Although our knowledge of Middle Formative construction sequences and site layouts is quite vague, it seems clear that stone-faced architecture became increasingly common in the Central Highlands after 700 ВС. Grove's (1974b) work in Morelos indicates that the technical aspects of stone construction were mastered during the Early Formative, so we assume that its expanded use reflects sociopolitical and economic changes, which motivated increasing investment in architectural projects. Public and residential buildings atop stone-faced platforms become progressively more visible as "Olmec" expression waned toward the end of the Middle Formative, signaling the emergence of a very different type of society in the Central Highlands as Mesoamerican geopolitics shifted gears. But once these monumental buildings were in place, perhaps serving to symbolically elevate some activities or families above others, they reinforced and institutionalized the growing disparities between lineages and communities that characterize the Late and Terminal Formative (see Joyce 2004). Stylistic transformations Stark (2007) argues that the changing nature of Olmec style from Early to Middle Formative resulted from inflationary tendencies as sacred symbols engraved on pottery became common currency throughout Mesoamerica, spurring Gulf Coast societies to restrict the holy images to scarcer materials like greenstone celts or large boulders. Although, with a few exceptions, carved stone monuments are uncommon Ö Springer</page><page sequence="15">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 15 in the Central Highlands during the Formative, excavations at Chalcatzingo and Zazacatla demonstrate that they are associated with large stone-faced platforms between 700 and 500 ВС. Grove (e.g., 1989, 1999, 2000c, 2005; Grove and Angulo 1987) has published extensively on the Chalcatzingo monuments, noting that although they are derived from La Venta artistic canons, they also incorporate new elements, like the quatrefoil motif, not found on the Gulf Coast. Grove and Gillespie (2009) argue that Chalcatzingo' s three thematically distinct groups of carvings - the hillside dedicated to the ancestral spirit and water; the talus slope presenting mythological scenes; and the village itself with renderings of individuals connected with rulership in association with stone-faced platforms - served to mark specific locations as access points to the spirit world and effectively categorize space in terms of the important sociopolitical changes and growing social inequality taking place during the Middle Formative. Additionally, Gillespie (2008) points out that Monument 34, in front of Structure 1 at Chalcatzingo, uses the same stacked spiral scrolls, J-volutes, and mat motifs employed in Izapan and lowland Maya representation to identify otherworldly ancestral rulers. Moreover, Chalcatzingo' s pairing of a carved stela with a round altar - the earliest example of this combination yet known in Mesoamerica (Grove 2008, p. 4) - and the depiction of a basal band, which perhaps designates the ground surface, on Stela 21 and the well- known Chalcatzingo vase (Taube 2004, p. 40, fig. 21d), are both elements found slightly later at Izapa and other southern sites (Guernsey 2006, p. 78). The recent discoveries of a quatrefoil basin at La Blanca, Guatemala (Love and Guernsey 2007), the quatrefoil "portal" in the murals of San Bartolo (Saturno 2009, p. 125, fig. 10), and the stucco "water" frieze with V-shaped clefts at El Mirador (Hansen 2009, pp. 11-13) provide additional ties between Chalcatzingo and the southern lands. These specific motifs have not been reported at other centers in the Central Highlands during either the Middle or the Late Formative. Houses and craft activity Revisiting the residential structures explored by the Chalcatzingo Project (Grove 1987), Hirth (2008, p. 94) explores how this research contributes to our present understanding of the emergence of complex society, thus offering another example of how existing data can continue to provide new insights. He reviews the evidence for family size and composition, economic and rank differences, and the relation between social stratification and specialized craft production. Hirth (2008, p. 118) notes that all of Chalcatzingo' s excavated dwellings were large enough to house extended rather than nuclear families, reflecting a shift that Flannery (2002) envisioned as the first step toward social complexity, since larger households can mobilize more labor; he suggests that this Middle Formative development is part of a generalized increase in corporate behavior at all levels of society. He sees corporate identity as the primary focus for representation and deduces that the carved stelae associated with Chalcatzingo' s elite residential buildings were used in lineage ritual and did not function as public monuments related to rulership. Ancestors and rulers, however, can be overlapping categories (Grove 1999; ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">16 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 Grove and Gillespie 2002), and the distinction between them, particularly in Middle Formative societies, might be blurred. Although Chalcatzingo provides the earliest direct evidence of an obsidian core- blade workshop in Mesoamerica (Burton 1987b), Hirth (2008, pp. 113-116) argues that the peripheral location of the debris and the data from the houses do not support Clark's (1987) suggestion that core-blade production and exchange were controlled by elites; instead, he identifies heavy use, but not production, of obsidian at the site's primary elite structure, and small-scale domestic crafting - perhaps to make tools for other craft activities - in at least one residence. Although Hirth' s analysis challenges the rise of merchant-rulers or elites who presumably would have controlled production and exchange during Middle Formative times, the workshop debris was redeposi ted and no evidence of manufacturing was found nearby (Burton 1987b, p. 321), so it remains unclear which house or houses controlled this activity. At Las Bocas, Paillés (2008a, p. 36) identified two early first millennium ВС domestic units, both with evidence of pottery making and obsidian blade production, mainly from Paredón and Otumba materials (Salazar 2008, p. 105). But due to the limited scope of her excavations, we lack information about the socioeconomic status of these households; thus they contribute little to the debate about elite control of production and exchange. Obsidian sourcing shows that as Middle Formative Tlaxcalan villages began to acquire more obsidian around 600 ВС, they became increasingly reliant on materials from the central Mexican region, specifically Otumba, Paredón, and Pachuca, and ceased to import from Oyameles (Carballo et al. 2007). This shift is associated with the emergence of regional centers in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, which were strongly oriented toward Central Highland economic interaction and changes in production technologies that imply increased craft specialization (Carballo et al. 2007, p. 40). To the east, in the northeastern Valley of Puebla, Cantona' s initial development around 600 ВС and its incremental control of the nearby Oyameles obsidian source (Gazzola 2005, p. 60) may have played a part in this modification of Tlaxcalan village procurement patterns. Cuicuilco In the Basin of Mexico, Heizer and Bennyhoff's (1958, 1972) work at Cuicuilco has long formed the basis for placing its first stone-faced platforms in the Middle Formative. Excavations at Cuicuilco "B" (Heizer and Bennyhoff 1958, 1972; Müller 1990) and at Cuicuilco "C" (Rodriguez 1993, 1994) produced numerous burials, public and residential architecture, bell-shaped pits, and other Middle through Terminal Formative evidence (see also Nebot 2003). In 1996, work on the south side of the Cuicuilco Pyramid (Cuicuilco "A") revealed that the small pillar at the center of a rectangular chamber uncovered by Cummings in 1925 was in fact an almost 4-m-high obelisk-like monolithic column of andesite set into the initial occupation surface, about 3.5 m below the present foot of the pyramid (Pérez Campa 1998). The base of the monument was painted red, and the buried lower section revealed two carved columns of eight circles, each surmounted by three (or perhaps four) rhombi with a circle at their center (Fig. 3). Since Heizer and Springer</page><page sequence="17">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 17 Fig. 3 Stela at Cuicuilco (modified from Pérez Campa 1998, p. 37) Bennyhoff (1972, p. 98) place the earliest of the three construction stages of the massive circular ceremonial platform at Cuicuilco "A". between 800 and 600 ВС, we can assume that during the Middle Formative, Cuicuilco, with its circular and elliptical clay or stone-faced platforms and its curious carved obelisk, was developing a symbolic system and a set of architectural canons quite distinct from those of its southern and eastern neighbors. Circular platforms are often linked with traditions to the west of the Basin of Mexico, and recent explorations in the Ö Springer</page><page sequence="18">18 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 Acámbaro Valley of southeastern Guanajuato (Darras 2006; Darras and Faugère 2007) have reignited considerations of Cuicuilco's relation to Chupicuaro and the obsidian sources of eastern Michoacán. Current dating indicates, however, that this is a Late and Terminal Formative phenomenon, so we discuss its significance in the following section. Nonetheless, it is clear that Cuicuilco's development was separated from the dynamics that nurtured Chalcatzingo's ties to the southeast and to the Pacific. Both Teopantecuanitlán and the new findings from Zazacatla help us visualize Chalcatzingo as a major player in an extensive interaction sphere, but the scale of Cuicuilco's impact beyond the Basin of Mexico is still uncertain. More well-documented evidence on Middle Formative occupations is needed to adequately discuss the variation among emerging rulership strategies, discern the concomitant regional patterns and their distributions, and identify the diverse long- distance networks that operated in the highlands. The Late and Terminal Formative During the past two decades, much of the planned research on the Central Highlands' Formative has been carried out in Puebla-Tlaxcala, which like the Basin of Mexico witnessed explosive population growth and the construction of impressive monumental architecture at a number of sites. There was a clear three-tiered settlement hierarchy, and recent studies have taken place at each level, including major centers like Xochitécatl and Cholula, minor centers like Cuauh- tinchan, La Laguna, and Xochiltenango, and villages like Tetimpa. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, work at Tlalancaleca (Garcia Cook 1981), Totimehuacan (Spranz 1970), and Xochitécatl (Delgadillo and Santana 1997; Spranz 1996; Spranz et al. 1978) indicated the emergence of a regional Late Formative tradition of large- scale civic-ceremonial architecture associated with monolithic basalt basins and stone sculpture (Palavicini 1998, p. 52). More recent excavations at Xochitécatl (Serra 1998a, 2001; Serra et al. 2001; Serra and Palavicini 1996) provide additional evidence for the association of these traits and situate the ritual use of carved stone in conjunction with massive public architecture in the latter part of the Late Formative (Serra and Lazcano 2008, pp. 238-243; Serra et al. 2001, p. 74). Some structures are of considerable size. The main mound at Totimehuacan, for example, is 24 m high and 160 m x 100 m at its base (Spranz 1970, p. 63), while the Pirámide de las Flores, Xochitécatl' s largest platform, measures 120 m x 165 m and rises over 30 m (Serra et al. 2001, p. 75). Indeed, both of these structures were more substantial than Cuicuilco's circular pyramid (135 m in diameter and about 20 m high [Marquina 1981, p. 49]), the first monumental stage of the Great Pyramid of Cholula (the Edifìcio de los Chapulines, 107 m x 130 m and just over 17 m high [Uruñuela et al. 2009, p. 147]), and the earliest phase of Teotihuacan's Moon Pyramid (23.5 m on a side [Sugiyama 2004, p. 107]); the latter two were built later, at the end of the first or the beginning of the second century AD (Sugiyama 2004, p. 101; Uruñuela et al. 2009, p. 151). Although there does not appear to be any consistent architectural patterning in the layout of these constructions, Uruñuela et al. (2006, 2009) identify two ô Springer</page><page sequence="19">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 19 similarities between Cholula's Edificio de los Chapulines and other buildings in the region. The precinct enclosed by bifacial talud walls that crowns the structure has parallels at both Totimehuacan and Xochitécatl, and Los Chapulines' two main façades (north and west) are traits also found on Totimehuacan' s main platform (south and west). But Los Chapulines has other characteristics not yet found elsewhere, like painted double-molding tableros , mud reliefs, and, above all, its complex morphology. Seven superimposed levels, each one different, create an asymmetrical yet balanced distribution of solid and open spaces; this, plus four main staircases (one on each side) and at least two secondary stairways, make it more akin to a southern Mesoamerican acropolis than to the Central Highland pyramids (although Mound 1 at Tlapacoya exhibits a comparable concept) (Uruñuela et al. 2006, p. 185, 2009, pp. 150-157, 161-163). Despite the apparent uniqueness of the major constructions, most of them share an orientation to the west. It has been suggested that Puebla-Tlaxcala' s monumental architecture reflects a strong ritual focus on the volcanoes that frame its landscape, and particular importance has been given to Popocatépetl, the "smoking mountain" to the west (e.g., Plunket and Uruñuela 2009; Seiferle-Valencia 2007; Serra 1998a; Serra et al. 2001; Uruñuela et al. 2006, 2009), and La Malinche to the east (Serra 1998a, 2001; Serra et al. 2001; Suárez 2005). Uruñuela et al. (2006, 2009) address this point in detail for the west façade of Los Chapulines at Cholula, and subsequently Seiferle- Valencia (2007, pp. 11, 136-138) has proposed that the west orientation of the main mounds at Xochitécatl, Totimehuacan, and Cuauhtinchan, a trio of sites she sees as the manifestation of a regional culture sharing a common understanding of the natural and cultural landscape, denotes ceremonial concern directed at Popocatépetl. While this may be the case, we still do not understand the nature of most public buildings in the area. As Joyce (2004) has pointed out, the first stone-faced platforms were probably intended to provide space for suprahousehold activities, but once they existed, they became focal points for the construction of communal memory; she cogently argues that durable mounded structures were not initially built to represent mountains but came to be identified with them later as succeeding generations assigned them new meanings and used them for social reproduction. Thus the creation of mounds intended to represent the "smoking mountain" on the west or La Malinche on the east might best be understood as the result of a historical trajectory that began at the end of the Middle Formative and came to fruition in the last centuries of the Late Formative. Sprajc's (2000, p. 404, 2001) study of astronomical alignments at 37 Central Highland sites, ranging from Formative to Postclassic, implies that civic-ceremonial architecture was generally oriented toward sunrise and sunset events visible on local horizons, which accords well with Broda's (1993) suggestion that Cuicuilco's public buildings, the most important of which faces west, were located with regard to first light along the Sierra Nevada on the eastern horizon (see Galindo and Esteban 2001 for the western horizon; also see Medina 2008). Serra et al. (2001) maintain that Xochitécatl's architecture was directed to a specific feature on La Malinche to the east, and she interprets the circular Edifìcio de la Espiral, set off- center to the west of the main plaza, as an effigy of Popocatépetl (Serra 1998b, p. 40). No other circular mounds have been identified in Puebla-Tlaxcala, although â Springer</page><page sequence="20">20 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 Seiferle- Valencia (2007, pp. 89, 133) posits that the Tepalcayo 4 at Totimehuacan and El Cerrito at Cuauhtinchan (both as yet unexcavated) might be "spiral" edifices. Ceremonial practices involving stone basins situated in front of the staircase of the most important pyramidal structure at both Xochitécatl and Totimehuacan and the conceptual link between platform and mountain have interesting parallels in the Terminal Formative houses of Tetimpa, a village on Popocatépetl's northeastern flank that was buried and preserved under volcanic ash. Our work there has documented the remains of 27 Late and Terminal Formative residences (Plunket and Uruñuela 1998a). The Tetimpa house has a large central platform used for family ritual flanked by two smaller lateral structures, which together frame a courtyard whose center is marked with a stone or a small shrine (Plunket and Uruñuela 2002b). Several shrines (Fig. 4a) consisted of a rectangular two-stage platform or hill, each stage equipped with its own interior chimney and crowned with a carved stone; in one case, between it and the staircase of the central ritual room was an overturned small stone basin, perhaps evidence of the domestic replication of the public rituals conducted at major centers like Xochitécatl or Totimehuacan. Another shrine was a low rectangular platform with a circular effigy mountain, which again sheathed a chimney capped with a carved-stone serpent (Fig. 4b) (Plunket and Uruñuela 1998b). The clearest platform/mountain tie was a miniature one-stage talud-tablero platform shrine, complete with central staircase (Fig. 4c), like the later, more elaborate versions in some of Teotihuacan's apartment compounds or the elite residences on the south side of Cholula's pyramid, but including a chimney like the rest of Tetimpa' s shrines (Plunket and Uruñuela 2006a, p. 166, fig. 22; Suárez 1985, p. 15). Although no shrine in the village is identical to another, to us the site's materializations of the sacred suggest that indeed Popocatépetl, the original "smoking mountain," was the focus of much ritual in the Puebla-Tlaxcala region during the Late and Terminal Formative (Plunket and Uruñuela 1998a), and that these domestic expressions can be related to the ceremonial activities framed by the monumental architecture of major centers. In spite of the important recent increase in research in Puebla-Tlaxcala, few civic-ceremonial buildings have been explored. Thus our knowledge of site layouts and architectural canons is limited, making it difficult to establish patterns of interaction among major settlements. Tlalancaleca employed talud-tablero façades during the Late Formative (Garcia Cook 1981, figs. 8-10), as did the village architecture of Tetimpa (Plunket and Uruñuela 1998a), but this has not been reported at other sites. In some cases this may be the result of excavation strategies that focus on staircases and centerlines and thus would not find tableros (see Plunket and Uruñuela 2002a), while in others it might be due to poor conservation of the upper part of the latest construction phase or the recycling of stone facings. The distinctive triadic arrangement and talud-tablero façades of Late and Terminal Formative dwellings in the piedmont of the Sierra Nevada (Plunket and Uruñuela 1998a, 2002a, 2004; Uruñuela and Plunket 2002, 2007) are not apparent at La Laguna in Tlaxcala (Carballo 2006, 2009) or at Cuauhtinchan in Puebla (Seiferle-Valencia 2007), although the triadic layout does occur in Terminal Formative Morelos (Hirth 1980, p. 48, fig. 10). Additionally, it is not clear if the talud-tablero embellished all of Tlalancaleca' s public buildings (see, for example, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="21">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 21 Fig. 4 Tetimpa shrines, a Volcano effigy with exposed chimney and an overturned stone basin behind the shrine, b Volcano shrine with sculptures still covering the chimneys, с Miniature talud-tablero platform shrine whose chimney was capped with a flat stone Garcia Cook 1984, p. 31, fig. 7), but it makes a dramatic polychromed appearance at Cholula on the Edificio de los Chapulines (Fig. 5) at the end of the first century AD (Uruñuela et al. 2006, 2009, pp. 156-159).

The Cholula tablero was framed by a double cornice, although in this section the upper cornice was destroyed (photo by Victor Blanco) assume that immigration into the city from various parts of the Central Highlands during the first century AD may have resulted in the appropriation of preexisting architectural formats - materializations of social segments and ritual practices - to integrate the new arrivals into a standard pattern (Angulo 2007; Carballo 2009; Headrick 2001, 2007; Plunket and Uruñuela 2002a; Uruñuela et al. 2006, 2009). In our opinion, the previous lack of standardization in the specifics of monumental construction suggests that the rulers of Puebla-Tlaxcala's large Late and Terminal Formative centers were constructing their own particular expressions of political and religious power; they acted as independent competitors experi- menting with novel building techniques and overlapping ritual practices that varied in relation to their shifting exchange networks and political alliances during what many consider to have been the region's cultural climax (Garcia Cook and Merino 1989). Some communities, like Capulac-Concepción and La Laguna, built enormous I-shaped ballcourts (Barba et al. 2009; Carballo 2009, p. 478, fig. 3; Garcia Cook 1983); others engaged in rituals that required stone basins set at the base of huge mounds. Some favored talud-tablero façades, and some began to install carved stone images in both public and domestic spaces. Some ceremonial Ô Springer</page><page sequence="23">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 23 buildings faced west, others faced north or east. Some groups plastered their buildings with stucco, others with clay. Part of this variation is certainly temporal, but more work will be required to clarify intersite relations and define regional cultures (cf. Castanzo 2002; Seiferle-Valencia 2007). Social inequality, households, and crafting One of the more intriguing topics addressed by recent excavations of houses at La Laguna and Tetimpa has to do with increasing social inequality. Neither site exhibits the degree of stratification suggested by the monumental architecture of the larger sites, but without the exploration of domestic contexts at major political centers, the data from the village of Tetimpa and the minor center of La Laguna provide only a partial view of Formative period social structure. Even so, at La Laguna, no clear status differences were evident in burial furniture or in the workmanship of domestic architecture; yet a close examination of earspools showed qualitative distinctions between those from a small house on the site periphery and those from a larger, more centrally located residence (Carballo 2006), indicating a subtle gradation of social differentiation. The larger residence also had 26 times the amount of greenstone as the smaller dwelling, pointing to its greater involvement in long-distance exchange networks (Carballo 2009, pp. 492, 496). On the other hand, the houses of Tetimpa display perceptible differences in the quality of construction, plus significant variations in room size and the use of elements like columns, decorated platform façades, tombs, and altars that appear to reflect the social hierarchies of ranked lineages (Plunket and Uruñuela 2002b; Plunket et al. 2005a; Uruñuela and Plunket 2001, 2002). Senior houses are larger and often have architectural ornamentation; they tend to display greater genealog- ical depth represented by numerous construction phases and more burials, including tombs. Perhaps most significantly, they exhibit an enhanced capacity to accumulate the surplus production of others (Uruñuela and Plunket 2001, n.d.). Inversely, junior residences are smaller and have limited storage facilities. They lack ornamentation and usually have shorter occupations, a fact that might reflect a pattern of neolocal residence as growing populations using bush-fallow agriculture (see Borejsza 2006) expanded into virgin territory. At the same time, the quantity and quality of mortuary offerings, as well as the location and nature of the funerary facilities, show a wide range of variation that surpasses gender and/or age criteria (Uruñuela and Plunket 2001, 2002). The domestic units at Loma Torremote (Santley 1993) in the Basin of Mexico indicate an organizational pattern not unlike Tetimpa' s, although the house compounds there were walled, perhaps like Cuicuilco's residences (Sanders et al. 1979, p. 76). But like Tetimpa, Loma Torremote' s dwellings were grouped into clusters, and one compound in each cluster seems to have been a large senior house that controlled ritual and obsidian blade production in addition to being able to store more than 220% of its yearly food requirements (Santley 1993, pp. 81-82). Although lime and pottery kilns occur around Tepeaca in central Puebla- Tlaxcala (Castanzo and Anderson 2004), both Tetimpa and La Laguna provide relatively little indication of craft specialization. One Tetimpa house had â Springer</page><page sequence="24">24 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20: 1-5 1 significantly more small obsidian endscrapers, perhaps for hide working (Iceland and Albaitero 1997; Uruñuela and Plunket 1998), but there is no evidence of pottery making and few signs of obsidian blade production. Obsidian items appear to have been acquired as finished artifacts through exchange networks that functioned within an 80-km radius, and some of the ceramics were made in the Basin of Mexico, Tlaxcala, and southern Puebla but not at Tetimpa (Plunket et al. 2005a), even though a stone-lined kiln was excavated a few kilometers from the site. Manos, metates, and carved shrine stones are made from local volcanic rock; one dwelling offered evidence of occasional axe making, but we have not identified formal workshops. The rough and non-standardized nature of these artifacts implies production by and for Tetimpa' s families. La Laguna presents a wider range of craft activities, including prismatic obsidian blade manufacture, maguey processing, and spinning and weaving, but again for household consumption (Carballo 2006, 2009, pp. 487, 491). In both sites, as Carballo (2009, p. 491) concludes for La Laguna, the recovered data on craft production suggest "diversified household economies with relatively low levels of interdependence." Excavations on domestic terraces at Nativitas (Hirth et al. 2009), 2 km southeast of Xochitécatl, afford indications of maguey processing, and at one house, Hirth (2005) identified evidence for the domestic production of jade beads and earspools, both important status markers. Hirth and his colleagues (2009) argue that while the apple green jade was probably procured from the Motagua Valley by elites, it was worked in house contexts by independent craftsmen. Additionally, his (Hirth 2005) reanalysis of a previously reported obsidian workshop within the ceremonial core of Xochitécatl (Blanco 1998) demonstrated that the assemblage more likely reflects small-scale production of gray obsidian blades for use in construction and other activities within the ritual precinct, probably by independent craftsmen fulfilling tribute responsibilities. This type of domestic and public small-scale crafting is similar to that documented at Middle Formative Chalcatzingo (Burton 1987a; Hirth 2008), at Loma Torremote for the initial Late Formative (Santley 1993, p. 75), and at one Terminal Formative house at El Tepalcate in the Basin of Mexico (Gámez 2005, p. 245). None of the assemblages studied so far have been able to link craft specialization with elite residences, but this does not necessarily mean that elites did not control production through consignment to individual artisans (Hirth 2005). Since no high-status houses at major Late Formative centers have been excavated, elite participation in trade and production remains an unresolved question. Expanding on Hirth' s (1998) distributional approach, De León et al. (2009) examine the shift from blade-trading to the exchange of obsidian cores for local, on- site blade working during the Late Formative. They develop three trade models and identify their archaeological signatures: (1) complete blades but no cores, (2) blades that were segmented before transport, and (3) locally made blades, either by itinerant or local craftsmen. Additionally, by focusing on blade totals and segment ratios, they are able to consider questions of scarcity and economizing behavior. Testing each model against materials from domestic contexts in Tlaxcala, the Basin of Mexico, and the Valley of Oaxaca, they conclude that although the structure of the Formative period obsidian trade was highly variable, the Tlaxcala corpus documents a sequence in Springer</page><page sequence="25">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 25 Fig. 6 Cuexcomates. a Modern cuexcomate with cylindrical base at San Juan Tejupa, Puebla, b Cylindrical base of an archaeological cuexcomate at Tetimpa. с Modern cuexcomate raised on four stones at San Juan Tejupa, Puebla, d Partially conserved wall of an archaeological cuexcomate raised on four stones at Tetimpa. e Four bases of archaeological "four stone" cuexcomates at Tetimpa, one of them still preserving the lower part of the wall which segmented blades were traded before whole blades, whereas on-site production did not emerge until the Late Formative.

Basin of Mexico sites had more whole blades and smaller segment ratios than Tlaxcala or Oaxaca, and Ö Springer</page><page sequence="26">26 J Archaeol Res (20 1 2) 20: 1-5 1 thus they probably had easy and reliable access to raw and processed obsidian, perhaps due to the availability of water transport (De León et al. 2009, p. 125). Another significant aspect of growing social inequality involves the accumulation of perishable surplus, and bell-shaped storage pits are a common feature of the Central Highland Formative. One of the hallmarks of the Terminal Formative at Tetimpa, however, is the replacement of these subterranean facilities with cuexcomates (the earliest reported for Mesoamerica), above-ground granaries that can still be found in the hinterland of the Sierra Nevada and whose archaeological signature consists of remains of a globular daub-plaster body raised on either four to six stones set in a rectangular pattern or a cylindrical masonry base (Fig. 6) (Uruñuela and Plunket n.d.). Storage has generally been treated as an expression of economic wealth, and some argue that the accumulated surpluses were used to host elaborate feasts since demonstrations of generosity were a recipe for social advancement within the competitive environment of Formative period chiefdoms (Clark and Blake 1994). Like Loma Torremote, Tetimpa' s senior residences had the most storage capacity and evidently these households were amassing the production of other families and probably feeding many individuals since some of them built additional kitchens. The tall, highly visible storage bins were usually placed commanding attention at the entrance to house compounds; this prominent public display implies that expressions of economic wealth were becoming more important (Uruñuela and Plunket n.d.). Ritual practice Domestic ritual has received increasing attention during the past 10 years (Carballo 2007; Gonlin and Lohse 2007; Plunket 2002), and Late and Terminal Formative sites in the Central Highlands have afforded significant insights into household religious practice, particularly Tetimpa' s domestic shrines. Residents commonly anchored the patio midpoint with variable combinations of one or more stone markers (often carved), an elongated andesitic stela, volcano effigies, or miniature talud-tablero platforms to mark the family's spiritual axis (Plunket and Uruñuela 2002b). Most shrine stones and stelae have red stains, which may result from ritual feeding with mineral pigments. Small birds, and perhaps bloodstained paper, were among the burnt offerings tendered by family members, and pedestal censers with incense were placed in front of the shrine (Plunket and Uruñuela 2002b). Paraphernalia for domestic cult was stored, and possibly used, in the center room of the house, directly behind the shrine. These items include various types of censers, small asymmetrical ceramic "feeding spoons," thick stone discs with ash residue, obsidian blades, and, in one case, a carved stone Huehueteotl, the Old Fire God. Carballo (2007) has identified variations of Huehueteotl in the Central Highlands and notes that they were used in household ritual in both Puebla-Tlaxcala and the Basin of Mexico during the Late Formative. They occur (Carballo 2007, pp. 57-58, figs. 5 and 6) at both villages and political centers, including Copilco, Cuicuilco, La Laguna, Tlalancaleca, Ticomán, Xalapazco, and Xochitécatl (Palavacini 1998, p. 55), but only at Tetimpa have they been found in primary context (Plunket and Uruñuela 2007). Small carved stone anthropomorphic heads with depressions on top, like those from Xochitécatl and Ticomán, were sometimes placed on Tetimpa' s ^ Springer</page><page sequence="27">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 27 Fig. 7 Small xantil-WYe, figurine from Tetimpa, probably representing the Old Fire God (the head is removable) patio shrines; a xantil-Wkt ceramic Old Fire God figure (Fig. 7) was included in a copious offering for an important male buried under the floor of a senior lineage house; and, as already noted, a stone figure, similar to one from Xalapazco (Taube 2004, fig. 47d), was stored in the central room of another dwelling. Although the expressions of the Old Fire God are variable, they evidence his emergence as a primary figure in domestic ritual. Storm God vessels also appear in both domestic and public contexts of this time (Carballo 2007, p. 53). At La Laguna (Carballo 2007, p. 61, figs. 9a-b) and Ticomán (Vaillant 1931, p. 393, plates LXVIII, LXXIXe-f), fragments of censer covers or perhaps masks bearing iconography that might refer to "Tlaloc" have been reported. But Carballo (2007, p. 62) points out that the first documented occurrence of "Tlaloc vessels" comes from the three tombs in Tlapacoya's Mound 1 (Barba 1956). He identifies these funerary structures as dedicatory offering complexes, rather than tombs, and suggests that the deposits were made to consecrate different construction phases of public architecture (Carballo 2007, p. 62), in essence a precursor to state ritual practices that appear later in the Moon Pyramid at Teotihuacan (Bracamontes 2002; Sugiyama 2007). Tlapacoya's tombs, however, are similar to Tomb 1 at Tetimpa (Uruñuela and Plunket 2001, pp. 8-9), although no Tlaloc effigy jars were among the burial furniture and do not occur in any context at â Springer</page><page sequence="28">28 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 this site. Tetimpa' s Tomb 1 is one of three tombs, and numerous other interments, placed in the platform nucleus under a room used for family ritual. At Tlapacoya, "Tlaloc" vessels occur not only in the tombs of Mound 1 but also outside the civic- ceremonial area. An elaborate example was included in a secondary burial of seven individuals about 30 m northeast of the archaeological zone (Torres 1997). Although the suggestion that Tlapacoya' s tombs are dedicatory offerings and that early versions of "Tlaloc" vessels mark them as such is intriguing, the fact that they also are found in other burial contexts at Tlapacoya and that similar tombs occur in senior lineage houses in villages implies that overlapping ritual practices were in use during the Late and Terminal Formative. As we have pointed out above, some of these were employed later at Teotihuacan, where they may have taken on new meanings. Formats of what were once high-status tombs later may have been used to create dedicatory offerings to consecrate new buildings. Tombs were very infrequent during the Formative in the Central Highlands, but as we have commented (Uruñuela and Plunket 2001, p. 19), at Tetimpa they are located within the platform nucleus, and it was only the deposition of more than 1 m of volcanic ash over this settlement that preserved these tomb-containing structures from destruction by later occupations. Late and Terminal Formative Tlapacoya shares a number of other traits with Tetimpa that illustrate connections across the Sierra Nevada. Tombs, flexed interments, and children buried with birds are found at both sites (Barba 1956, pp. 97-113; Uruñuela and Plunket 2002), and there are general similarities in the pottery and figurines (Hernández 2000; Mauricio 2002). While Tetimpa' s ceramic inventory includes an early version of Thin Orange (Plunket et al. 2005a), usually found in burial contexts, 50 years ago Barba (1956, p. 80, lámina 16a, c, g) presciently suggested that the three orange paste vessels from Tlapacoya' s tombs were precursors to that ware. As might be expected, the Tlapacoya examples are more elaborate than those from Tetimpa (Fig. 8), but early Thin Orange vessel shapes are highly variable (Plunket and Uruñuela 2007; Plunket et al. 2005b). It is likely that the early Thin Orange trade route went through Tetimpa, over the Paso de Cortés, and down into the southeastern Basin, explaining how the village ended up with some of these pieces that were considered valuable enough to be included in Tlapacoya' s elite tombs. Barba (1956, pp. 82-85, láminas 17 and 18) also reported "fresco" and "stucco" decorated vessels from Tlapacoya' s Tombs 2 and 3 respectively, and channeled blackware, similar to pieces in a stone-lined offering associated with a small temple at Cuauhtinchan (Seiferle- Valencia 2007, p. 74, fig. 3.15). Possibly these sites participated in some of the same trading networks, and both Barba (1956, p. 143) and Seiferle- Valencia (2007, pp. 78, 96) look south to Monte Albán for the source of the stuccoed/fresco wares, while channeled blackware suggests ties to Guanajuato (see Darras and Faugère 2008, p. 68, fig. 8). Chupicuaro reconsidered Central Mexico's Late and Terminal Formative periods have often been considered a time of strong outside influence, particularly from West Mexico (e.g., Darras 2006; Florance 1989; Guevara 1975; McBride 1974; Porter 1956). Darras and Springer</page><page sequence="29">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20: 1-5 1 29 Fig. 8 Precursors of Classic period Thin Orange from Tlapacoya (redrawn from Barba 1956 lám. 16 а, с, and g) and Tetimpa (vessel shapes irregularities are intentionally represented) Faugère (2007) have reassessed these ideas as they seek to contextualize data from their recent work on Chupicuaro culture in the Acámbaro Valley of southeastern Guanajuato. The virtual abandonment of the Toluca Valley during the latter part of the Formative (González 1999, pp. 73-74) loosely coincides with Chupicuaro' s climax (Darras and Faugère 2007, p. 61). This development may reflect important changes in the structure of the Ucareo-Zinapécuaro obsidian trade, a source that produced some of Mesoamerica's first prismatic blades for Gulf Coast Olmec and Basin of Mexico centers during the Early Formative (Cobean 2002, pp. 62-67, 197; however, see Darras 2005). Cuicuilco seems to have played an important role in this shift as it developed into the Basin's major center at the start of the Late Formative (Bennyhoff 1966, p. 21). Darras and Faugère' s (2007) summary of the debate over â Springer</page><page sequence="30">30 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 Chupicuaro' s relation to settlements in the Basin of Mexico and beyond demonstrates that most archaeologists working in the Basin and Puebla-Tlaxcala have focused on the presence of H4-like figurines and the bichrome and polychrome ceramics for which Chupicuaro is famous, but, with the exception of Florance (1989, 2000), none seems to have considered what it might have received in return. The Chupicuaro region has cinnabar and other mineral deposits around its numerous hot springs, and in prehispanic times these resources were exploited for pigments to create the creams and deep reds of the Chupicuaro painted ware tradition that influenced many of the Late Formative pottery producers in central Mexico (Darras and Faugère 2008, p. 66). However, virtually no artifacts that could be tied to Cuicuilco or other sites in the Basin were encountered (Darras and Faugère 2007, p. 70). And in spite of their proximity to Ucareo-Zinapécuaro, a source that is abundantly represented at Cuicuilco (Alejandro Pastrana, personal communication 2009), the sites explored by Darras and Faugère (2007, p. 67) relied on obsidian from nearby Los Agustinos and did not use prismatic blades. Excavations and geophysical prospecting at several sites in the Acámbaro Valley have identified low circular platforms (one of them faced with stone) that supported perishable structures, large-scale circular sunken patios, small oval or circular houses built on sandstone or volcanic tuff foundations, still smaller circular mortuary structures, and shaft or boot-shaped tombs, which according to Darras and Faugère (2007, pp. 62-65, 2010) are architectural and funerary canons that link the earliest settlers of the region to the traditions of western Mexico between 400 and 100 ВС. Still, evidence from western Puebla calls for continued consideration of the relationship between the Acámbaro Valley and the Central Highlands. For example, one of the earliest tombs at Tetimpa is a boot-shaped pit sealed with andesitic slabs (Uruñuela and Plunket 2001, pp. 14-15), much like a later one described by Darras and Faugère (2007, p. 65), and ceramics from other Tetimpa tombs and burial contexts share attributes with pottery from Tlapacoya, Chupicuaro, and Cuauhtin- chan (e.g., channeled black monochromes and bird effigy vessels). At Colotzingo three Late Formative sequential burials were placed in an 80-cm-deep cylindrical Fig. 9 Western-style polychrome vessel from a Late Formative burial at Colotzingo â Springer</page><page sequence="31">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 31 pit, and two vessels (Fig. 9), obviously imported from the eastern frontier of West Mexico, were among the 34 offerings (Uruñuela 1998, p. 489, fig. 5). Additionally, Darras and Faugère (2007, p. 67) note important changes in the Acámbaro Valley during the second century ВС, including the construction of a square, not circular, sunken patio that signals greater complexity and variation in the Late Formative sequence of the Chupicuaro region than previously assumed. Cuicuilco's circular architecture (Heizer and Bennyhoff 1958, 1972; Müller 1990; Rodriguez 1993, 1994) and the stylistic similarities between the figurines and ceramics of southeastern Guanajuato and the Central Highlands beckon for more analyses, particularly the sourcing of pottery, figurines, and obsidian from both areas. We suspect, however, that color may have been a particularly significant variable in the Late Formative ceramic trade and that the Chupicuaro tradition's influence on the Central Highlands was closely tied to its mineral pigments and its successful innovations in color technology and design as trichrome painting became fashionable with the onset of this period (Heizer and Benny hoff 1972, p. 100). As mentioned above, the stucco and fresco wares from Tlapacoya and Cuauhtinchan, in addition to the elaborate use of colorful motifs on gourds (Seiferle- Valencia 2007, pp. 71-72) and other perishable materials (Porter 1956, p. 567), indicate that painted embellishment was highly prized, although in these cases it was also highly unstable. Technologies that could produce permanent pigmentation would have been in high demand. Color also might explain the rising popularity of Thin Orange ceramics from southern Puebla and of the assorted types of negative decoration of this time period. But the question of what flowed in the opposite direction, both to Chupicuaro and to southern Puebla, remains open. What Terminal Formative really means Chronology has become increasingly important to our understanding of the Formative-Classic transition. There are two basic positions on Terminal Formative periodization: (1) the long view, which encompasses Teotihuacan's Patlachique, Tzacualli, and Miccaotli phases (100 BC-AD 250), and (2) the short view, which limits this period to 100 BC-AD 100. We prefer the short view because the archaeological evidence from these two centuries indicates accelerated social and political transformations that led to the establishment of a new Teotihuacan- dominated world order by the second century AD. Settlement pattern surveys in the Basin of Mexico show that rural populations contracted while Teotihuacan's population swelled to an unprecedented size during the First Intermediate, Phase Four (100 BC-AD 100) (Sanders et al. 1979, pp. 105-107); furthermore, excavations in the city's monumental constructions over the past 20 years (e.g., Sugiyama 2004, p. 101, fig. 4.2) provide ample evidence of dramatic changes in the sociopolitical order between 100 ВС and AD 250. Together these data imply that the city's population increase began prior to key social and political changes. Whether one takes the long or the short view, the shift towards a powerful state organization was set in motion between 100 ВС and AD 100 and spectacularly materialized in Teotihuacan's architectural complexes shortly thereafter. On the other side of the Sierra Nevada, most Springer</page><page sequence="32">32 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20: 1-5 1 major population centers were totally or partially abandoned in the first century AD, and Cholula began to emerge as the second most important city of the Central Highlands, in a process that seems to parallel events in the Basin of Mexico, albeit on a smaller scale (Dumond 1972; Plunket and Uruñuela 2006b, 2008; Uruñuela et al. 2009). Interest in the rise of Teotihuacan has eclipsed considerations of the Terminal Formative in other parts of the Central Highlands, and indeed, the few studies that exist were designed to consider the Teotihuacan phenomenon from the hinterland (e.g., Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007; Hirth 1980). There is no escaping the fact that our grasp of other subregions of the Central Highlands, which also underwent notable changes during these two centuries, is contingent on their relations with the developing Teotihuacan state and requires both macroregional and multiscalar approaches (Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007). The Toluca Valley, already suffering from a severe population decline, was virtually abandoned in the Terminal Formative (González 1999, pp. 73-74), while Morelos developed territorially defined chiefdoms that interacted with Teotihuacan (Hirth 1980, p. 93). However, the territories on either side of the Sierra Nevada appear to have spawned numerous competing polities seeking to extend their influence and control of resources through the promotion of impressive religious ceremonies, expanded trade, and the intensification of craft activity, a set of strategies that tended to concentrate population. In their recent GIS study of political evolution and transportation corridors in northern Tlaxcala, Carballo and Pluckhahn (2007) identify two main trade routes linking Basin of Mexico sites with points east and south: (1) the Tlaxcala Corridor in the north, which would have been most useful to Teotihuacan, and (2) a southern passage, which would have been more valuable to Cuicuilco and other southern Basin sites. They note that Cuicuilco, Tlapacoya, Tlalancaleca, and Xochitécatl are situated along this least-cost southern route, and they identify patterns consistent with the formation of small autonomous regional polities that profited from their location along this artery (Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007, p. 620). During the Late Formative, La Laguna appears to have controlled the eastern part of the Tlaxcala Corridor in the north until this passage was dramatically reorganized by an expanding Teotihuacan state during the Forma- tive-Classic transition (Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007, p. 626), much like what Hirth and Angulo (1981) found in Morelos. La Laguna itself was abandoned and at least one important house was set on fire, although it is not clear whether the burning was part of a termination ritual, was provoked by internal conflict, or reflects Teotihuacan military intervention (Carballo 2009, p. 496). Violence, evidenced by decapitation and burning, also is manifest at one of Tetimpa's senior Terminal Formative residences and its associated lineage structure, but in this instance the house was rebuilt, albeit by a much impoverished family (Uruñuela and Plunket 2007). It might reflect intervillage raiding that resulted from mounting competition for land and labor, as tlacolol farming of hillsides led to progressive land degradation in piedmont areas that did not employ measures to check soil erosion (Borejsza 2006; Borejsza et al. 2008; Heine 2003). Coapan (Uruñuela n.d.) and Colotzingo (Uruñuela 1989, 1998) both have substantial amounts of Springer</page><page sequence="33">J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 33 burnt wattle and daub that indicate conflagrations at the end of their occupation sequence, although some or all of the burning at settlements along the western limits of the Puebla Valley may actually have been caused by the volcanic explosion discussed below. In any event, there is mounting empirical evidence that the Terminal Formative was a period of growing tension among regional polities and that it witnessed Teotihuacan's initial bids to gain control of the most valuable trade routes and resources to the south and east. To us, this indicates that the shift toward urbanism and state-level political structures took place at the end of a period of sustained population growth and suggests that this growth was the ultimate underlying cause for the qualitative shift that archaeologists identify as the Formative-Classic transition (see Carneiro 2000). But the Terminal Formative also is separated from the Classic by a spectacular eruption of the Popocatépetl volcano around the middle of the first century AD (Panfil 1996; Panfil et al. 1999; Plunket and Uruñuela 1998a, 2000a), although as we have outlined elsewhere (Plunket and Uruñuela 2006b, 2008; Uruñuela et al. 2006, 2009), the event was probably more an accelerant than a fundamental cause of change. It happened at a time when populations were growing rapidly and signs of mounting social inequality based, at least in part, on the ability of some groups to accumulate and manage the surplus of others were becoming more apparent. The eruption deposited about 3.2 km3 of pumice over an area extending 25 km east of the crater (Panfil 1996, p. 16; Siebe 2000, p. 61), burying villages like Tetimpa under a thick layer of ash and causing the abandonment of numerous settlements (Plunket and Uruñuela 2000b, 2003; Uruñuela and Plunket 2003). Shortly thereafter, a 30-100-m-thick lava flow - the Pedregal de Nealtican - destroyed another 50 km2 of Popocatépetl' s piedmont and altered the surface hydrology of western Puebla (Panfil 1996, pp. 16-20). Carballo and Pluckhahn (2007, p. 614) posit that the least-cost southern route connecting the Basin of Mexico with the Puebla Valley followed the approximate trajectory of the modern toll road, crossing the Sierra Nevada between Iztaccihuatl and Cerro Tlaloc, but as we suggested earlier, an additional passage may have been farther south at the Paso de Cortés. If so, the volcanic eruption would not only have devastated landscapes on either side of the mountain divide, creating thousands of refugees who poured into emerging cities beyond the high-risk zone, but it also would have blocked Cuicuilco's access to major exchange networks. Thus, although this natural disaster does not explain the Formative-Classic transition, it does help us understand why so much happened in such a short period of time. Cuicuilco's fate has been the subject of recent geoarchaeological studies that have invalidated the idea that the city was destroyed by lava from Xitle volcano in the first century ВС (Sanders et al. 1979, pp. 106-107). Although the Late and Terminal Formative witnessed much volcanic activity along the southern rim of the Basin of Mexico, 14C dates on vegetation ignited by the lava from Xitle's eruption now place the event during the second half of the third century AD (Cordova et al. 1994; González et al. 2000; Siebe et al. 2004, 2005). By that time, most of Cuicuilco had already been abandoned and Teotihuacan was extending its power far beyond the confines of the Basin. Thus we think that Popocatépetl' s first century AD eruption is directly linked to Cuicuilco's downfall (Plunket and Uruñuela 2006b; Ö Springer</page><page sequence="34">34 J Archaeol Res (2012) 20:1-51 Siebe 2000). Not only did it present major population centers with an ecological disaster of regional proportions, but it must have funneled trade towards the northern Tlaxcala Corridor, providing Teotihuacan with an important advantage over its southern competitor. Hence, recent findings challenge the notion that Teotihuacan's rise to power can be explained chiefly in terms of its dynamic competition with Cuicuilco within the Basin of Mexico; it has become progressively more apparent that its interaction with adjacent regions played an instrumental role in shaping the core of the great city. Final comments Since an increasing amount of Central Highland archaeology has been overtaken by rescue and salvage work, theoretical research trends are becoming ever more difficult to categorize. There is little that realistically can be done to alter this trajectory, except to withhold funding from projects at protected sites and to encourage research in areas destined for development (Robertson and Gorenflo 2008). Working at "endangered" sites presents its own perils for archaeologists and their excavations, but there is much to be gained by filling in the enormous gaps in our knowledge. Our own experience at Tetimpa, a truly endangered and unprotected site, has demonstrated the value of treading into this politically and socially volatile terrain. Various scholars have shown that existing data can be mined for new insights, particularly when innovative techniques and methodologies are applied to them (e.g., Blomster et al. 2005a; Carballo et al. 2007; Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007; De León et al. 2009; Hirth 2005; Joyce 1999); younger scholars should be steered towards unfinished analyses and urged to apply fresh perspectives to existing records. Here we have tried to link recent work to older data in an attempt to understand "the interactions that make regions and their neighbors interdependent" (Kowalewski 2004, p. 97), but it is clear that the implementation of macroregional and multilevel approaches will require more complete reporting of - and better access to - both planned investigation and rescue and salvage archaeology. Recent research on agricultural systems and ecological degradation has led us to reconsider the nature and effects of Formative period cultivation. There are indications that Late Formative farming practices were far from benign and, in fact, caused devastating erosion that helped spur the political transformations that divide the Formative from the Classic (Borejsza et al. 2008; Heine 2003). Additionally, archaeologists and geologists have put the "volcanic" back in the Transverse Neovolcanic Axis by identifying and dating previously unrecognized eruptive events and incorporating perspectives derived from disaster studies, which focus on the long-term human response to natural catastrophe rather than just the chaos of the immediate misfortune (Plunket and Uruñuela 2006b, 2008). Instead of merely considering the destructive force of nature, disaster studies concentrate on the creative aspects of human agency as new opportunities arise from the ashes (Hoffman and Oliver-Smith 2001; Uruñuela et al. 2006, 2009). As scholars focus on subregions beyond the Basin of Mexico, they reinforce our knowledge of that vital area and advance the prospects for a truly macroregional Ö Springer</page><page sequence="35">J Archaeol Res (20 1 2) 20: 1 -5 1 35 archaeology, which can consider the major social shifts that ultimately led to complex organizations (Balkansky 2006; Marcus 2008). By implementing multi- scalar approaches - activity areas, dwellings, house clusters, villages, regional polities, and regions - they are beginning to test accepted interpretations of culture history and social evolution, sometimes complementing them and at other times challenging them. Our grasp of household ritual, craft production, the development of storage technologies, the escalation of social inequality, the nature and extent of conflict in Neolithic societies, and the circumstances of abandonment has been eminently enhanced by domestic archaeology. Chemical and pétrographie studies, in addition to geographical analyses, have made us aware of the extremely variable and complex trade relations that bound Central Highland communities to other Mesoamerican regions. But we have really just scratched the surface. More work is urgently required on Formative period monumental architecture as these buildings are becoming progressively more endangered by expanding modern populations. We still know little about their construction sequences, function, and architectural canons, and site layouts for this time period are at best minimally documented and understood. The environmentally variable Mesa Central obliges us to expand our sample of well-mapped sites, excavated public and residential buildings, and accurately analyzed activity areas to explore how human populations culturally manipulated this diversity. In the end, much of the cultural overlap evidenced in the Central Highlands throughout the Formative has to do with its location astride the Neovolcanic Axis, a broad geographic divide that in and of itself creates considerable opportunities for the interchange of goods, ideas, and people. The productive potential of its large basins and valleys allowed for high population densities and demographic nucleation, while its ecological variability and mineral resources promoted the establishment of distant social and economic ties so instrumental in generating the complexity and distinctive regional expressions that helped transform this upland territory, where east meets west, into both Mesoamerica's and Mexico's center.
