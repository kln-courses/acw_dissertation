Melvin, and Paula Lux University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ABSTRACT A test series using unembalmed cadavers was conducted to investigate thoracic response dif- ferences in lateral impacts between high energy (rib fractures produced) and low energy (no rib fractures produced) testing and also the response to low energy impacts for different im- pact directions (frontal, A5°, and lateral). Five of the test subjects were instrumented with a n i ne-acce 1 erometer package and an eighteen- acce 1 erometer array to measure thoracic response. Seven of the test subjects were in- strumented with a triaxial acce 1 erometer on the head and a s i x-acce 1 erometer array to measure thoracic response. Impact events were performed with either the UMTRI pendulum impact device or the UMTR I pneumatic impact device. The subject was struck with a free-traveling mass (25 or 56 kg) which was fitted with either a 15 cm round or 20 cm square rigid metal surface. For dif- ferent impact tests this surface had affixed to it various materials which would produce dif- ferent force-time and load distribution charac- ter i st i es . INJURIES TO THE THORAX and upper abdominal regions are second only to head injuries as the most frequent cause of death in motor vehicle accidents (I).1 Using animals and human cadavers as surrogates, several b i omechan i ca 1 studies of blunt thoracic impact have been car- ried out in an attempt to determine the kinematic and the injury response associated with thoracic trauma. The information obtained from these experiments has been used to corre- late impact parameters to injury patterns and has also been the basis of mathematical and physical models (anthropomorphic test device or ATD) . Through these efforts a better under- standing of the mechanisms of thoracic injury may be achieved. 1Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. An extensive variety of kinematic response and certain types of injury response have been obtained by blunt impact to a cadaveric subject without direct vehicle impact testing. Several studies have used this approach to determine the mechanisms of thoracic injury (2-26). Nahum, Kroell et al. (2,3*6,7) gathered kinematic and injury response data on cadaveric specimens sub- jected to blunt anterior-posterior sternal im- pact and correlated the computed response parameters to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ratings. This study concluded, in part, that some response parameters such as maximum ac- celeration and the severity index for the ster- num and spine had an inverse correlation for a given type of impact; chest deflection, conver- sely, was found to correlate directly with the degree of injury (AIS). Robbins et al. (3) used sled impacts to generate blunt thoracic impact data from both cadavers and primates. Thoracic acce 1 erometer data were found to provide a good basis for generating analytical functions for the prediction of injury. These and other thoracic impact data were used by Eppinger et al. (8) to formulate a methodology for injury prediction based solely on acceleration response data. In addition, a study by Nusholtz et al. (IA) investigated the response of cadavers as well as live and postmortem primates to blunt (lateral) thoraco-abdom i na 1 impact, resulting in additional kinematic and injury response data. Eppinger and Chan (28) utilized an ap- proximate finite impulsive response (AFIR) characterization of the human thorax to model thoracic acceleration response in lateral im- pacts. The left and right upper rib accelera- tion response was modeled from both rigid wall and pendulum impacts and compared to actual im- pact data with good agreement. It was suggested that the simulated digital impulsive response signature could be used in conjunction with lateral impact injury criteria to identify im- pact conditions which minimize the severity of trauma and lead to improved passenger protection i n automob i 1 es . 4.419 0096-736X/84/9204-041 9$02.50 Copyright 1984 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">4.420 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. Kali ieris et al. (23) compared acceleration response to damage response for ten cadaveric specimens in lateral impact tests against rigid and cushioned barriers. The reproducibility of the kinematic response observed by these authors prompted the suggestion that a single anthropomorphic test dummy may be representative of the kinematic response of a large section of the population with respect to lateral impacts, but other independent physical factors are necessary to ascertain the concomitant injuries. This paper presents some preliminary results from an ongoing study to describe kinematic and injury response of the human thorax to blunt impact. In particular, techni- ques for both destructive and non-destructive testing of the thorax will be compared and evaluated in both the time and frequency doma i ns . METHODOLOGY A detailed discussion of the techniques, procedures, and methodology for this series of tests is given in (28) and outlined below. IMPACT TESTING - Using UMTR I 1 s pendulum and pneumatic impacting devices with 25 kg im- pactors, five cadavers were each subjected to a series of 3 to 5 low-energy impacts in various initial positions to obtain basic kinematic in- formation, and a single high-energy lateral thorax impact to gain additional kinematic and damage response data. These subjects were in- strumented with an array of 18 thoracic ac- celerometers to measure impact response on the thorax and a n i ne-acce 1 erometer plate on the head for three-dimensional motion determination. The location of the thoracic acce 1 erometer s and their sensitive axes are shown in Figure 1. A second group of seven subjects, instru- mented with a s i x-acce 1 erometer array on the thorax and a triaxial acce 1 erometer cluster on the head, were subjected to a lateral thorax im- pact on the left arm near the shoulder using a rigid 56 kg f ree- trave 1 i ng mass. Initial Conditions and Positioning -- For all tests, the subject was placed in a restraint harness which was in turn suspended from an overhead pulley system (Figure 2) . The head was suspended in a natural position by a rope tied to a head harness, threaded through an electronic rope cutter, and tied to the overhead pulley. Prior to impact, the electronic rope cutter is activated. Subject Preparation -- Following transfer to UMTR I , the cadaveric subjects were stored at A°C until subsequent use. The subjects were ex- amined rad i ol og i ca 1 1 y prior to the installation of acce 1 erometer and pressure transducer mount- ing hardware; anthropometric measurements were made . Pressur i zat i on -- The vascular and pulmo- nary systems of each subject were repressur i zed just prior to impact. Pressure transducers were used to monitor both the degree of initial pres- surization and the change in system pressure during impact. The vasculature was pressurized, and the dynamic pressure measured using a Kul i te transducer guided through the carotid artery and positioned in the aortic arch. Flow from the thoracic arterial system was limited by the use of a specially made balloon catheter. This catheter was also guided through the carotid artery into the aorta and down the descending aorta to a point just beyond the diaphragm; the placement of the balloon was controlled using X- rays. The pressurizing fluid was introduced through the catheter and released behind the ba 1 1 oon . A tube was placed in the trachea and con- nected to a pressur i zat i on system to inflate the lungs. Just 20 ms prior to impact a stopper was removed electronically from the trachea tube al- lowing the lungs direct air communication. An Endevco pressure transducer was inserted into the trachea for measurement of dynamic pressure. Acceleration Measurement -- To document kinematic response of the subjects, arrays of acce 1 erometer s were affixed to the head and thorax of each subject in different configura- tions depending on the test series. For tests using the linear pendulum or pneumatic impact device with the 26 kg impact piston, the thorax was instrumented with 18 ac- celerometers in the ' f o 1 1 ow i ng manner: triaxial acce 1 erometer clusters were rigidly attached to the right and left fourth ribs, upper sternum, and T1 and T12 thoracic vertebrae. Single ac- celerometers were affixed to the right and left eighth ribs and lower sternum. In addition, a n i ne-accel erometer array was used to document three-dimensional motion of the head. Subjects impacted by the linear pendulum with the 56 kg piston were instrumented with two triaxial clusters of acce 1 erometer s on the thorax, one at mid-sternum (defined as the point on the subject halfway between the top of the manubrium and the tip of the xyphoid process) and one on the T6 thoracic vertebra. Also, a triaxial acce 1 erometer package was affixed to the head. Head 9~AX -- Several metal self-tapping screws were threaded directly into the parietal and occipital bones of the skull through small pilot holes. A magnesium acce 1 erometer mounting plate was positioned near the screws on the ex- posed skull. Plastic acrylic was molded around the plate such that the plate became rigidly at- tached to the skull. Three triaxial clusters of acce 1 erometer s were then attached to their posi- tions on the plate. S ter num -- Incisions were made at the at- tachment points on the sternum for the mounts. Small braided nails were tapped into the ster- num, encased in acrylic, and the acce 1 erometer mounting platform was embedded into the acrylic (Fig. 3, M . R i bs -- Incisions were made over the fourth and eighth ribs on each side, such that the flat part of the exposed rib was normal to the</page><page sequence="3">THORACIC RESPONSE 4.421 Figure 1.

To ensure rigidity, the mounts were fitted with pins and tied with wire to the flat surface of each ex- posed rib (Figure 3» *♦) • Spi ne -- Incisions were made over the ver- tebrae. Lateral supports for the acce 1 erometer mounts were anchored on the lamina bilaterally, such that they would flank the spinous process. The acce 1 erometer mount itself was fitted over these supports and screwed directly into the spinous process. Acrylic was applied under and around the mounts to insure rigidity (Figure 3» M . Photok i nemetr i es -- High-speed photographic coverage of the test consisted of two lateral views. A Hycam camera operating at 3000 frames per second provided a close-up view of the thorax, while a Photosonics IB camera operating at 1000 frames per second recorded an overall view of the test subject during the impact. The motion of the subject was determined from the film by following the motion of five-point phototargets on the acromion and sternum, as well as "single-point" phototargets on the head and impactor piston. LINEAR PENDULUM IMPACT DEVICE - The UMTR I linear pendulum impact device uses a free- falling pendulum as an energy source, which strikes either a 25 kg or 5&amp; kg impact piston which is guided linearly by a set of Thomson linear ball bushings. Axial loads were measured directly with a GSE biaxial load cell or calcu- lated from data recorded from a Setra Model 111 acce 1 erometer . Shear loads were measured when relevant, with the biaxial load cell. Impact conditions between tests were con- trolled by varying impact velocity and the type and depth of padding on the impactor surface. Piston velocity was measured by timing the pul- ses from a magnetic probe which senses the mo- tion of targets in the piston. A specially designed timer box was used to control and synchronize the impact events during a particular test, such as the release of the pendulum and activation and deactivation of the lights and high speed cameras. BALLISTIC PENDULUM IMPACT DEVICE - In ad- dition to the pendulum, a new impact device was constructed and used in the most recent test series. It consists of a 25 kg ballistic pen- dulum mechanically coupled to the UMTR I pneumatic impact device which is used as the energy source (Figure 5). This device consists of an air reservoir and a ground and honed cylinder with a carefully fitted piston. The piston is rigidly connected to the ballistic pendulum through a specially constructed steel rod. The piston which is propelled by com- pressed air through the cylinder from the air reservoir chamber accelerates the ballistic pen- dulum. The piston is arrested at the end of its travel allowing the ballistic pendulum to become a f ree-travel i ng impactor. The ballistic pen- dulum is fitted with an inertia-compensated load cell. This device may be used to provide greater impact energies than previously possible by taking advantage of the higher velocities available with the pneumatic impactor. METHODS OF ANALYSIS -- In order to analyze the absolute and relative motion of various points on the thorax during an impact event, the motion of ten separate points was documented from acce 1 erometer data. Uniaxial ac- celerometers were placed on the right and left eighth ribs and lower sternum. Triaxial clusters of acce 1 erometer s recorded the anatomi- cal P-A, R-L, and I -S motion of the right and left fourth ribs, mid and upper sternum, and Tl, T6, and T12 thoracic vertebrae. Thus, a frame field was defined for each of these moving po i nts . A vector field is a function which assigns a uniquely defined vector to each point along the path generated by a moving point. Similar- ly, any collection of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors emanating from each point on the path is a frame field. Thus any vector defined on the path (for example, acceleration) may be resolved into three orthogonal components of any well-defined frame field. In biomechanics research, frame fields com- monly used are defined on the basis of anatomi- cal reference frames. The anatomical reference frames used here for the triaxial clusters are shown in Figure 1. Other frame fields, such as the Principal Direction Triad (31) or Frenet- Serret frame (30), which contain information about the motion embedded in the frame field have also been used to describe motion resulting from impact. In the case of a single triaxial ac- celerometer, the use of the F renet-Ser ret frame was impractical but it had been found (30, 31) that in many cases during direct impacts it was possible to find the most significant component of acceleration; therefore, the principal direc- tion of motion could be obtained. One method of determining the principal direction of motion and constructing the Prin- cipal Direction Triad was to determine the direction of the acceleration vector in the moving frame of the triaxial acce 1 erometer cluster and then describe the transformation necessary to obtain a new moving frame that would have one of its axes in the principal direction. A single point in time at which the acceleration was a maximum was chosen to define the directional cosines for transforming from the tri ax frame to a new frame in such a way that the resultant acceleration vector (AR) and "principal" unit vector (Al) were co- directional. This then can be used to construct a new frame rigidly fixed to the triax, but dif- fering from the original one by an initial rota- tion. After completing the necessary transfor- mation, a comparison between the magnitude of the principal direction and the resultant ac- celeration was performed.</page><page sequence="6">4.424 G. S.

Pneumatic Ballistic Pendulum</page><page sequence="7">THORACIC RESPONSE 4.425 TRANSFER FUNCTION ANALYSIS - With blunt impacts, the relationship between a transducer time history at a given point and the transducer time history of another given point of a system can be expressed in the frequency domain through the use of a transfer function. A fast Fourier transformation of simultaneously monitored transducer time histories can be used to obtain the frequency response functions of impact force and accelerations of remote points. Once ob- tained a transfer function of the form 7M 1{ i a) Ì- ; = w * F (F(t)) 7M 1{ i a) Ì- ; = w * F (A(t) ) can be calculated from the transformed quan- tities where co is the given frequency, and F (F(t))andF ( A ( t ) ) are the Fourier transforms of the impact forces and acceleration of the point of interest, at the given frequency. This particular transfer function is closely related to a mechanical transfer impedance which is defined as the ratio between simple harmonic driving force and corresponding velocity of the point of interest. Mechanical transfer im- pedance is a complex valued function which for the purpose of presentation will be described by its magnitude and its phase angle. In addition to a transfer function relating force to velocity, a transfer function can be generated which relates the response of one point in the system to another point in the sys- tem, the response being expressed in the fre- quency domain. Analogous to mechanical im- pedance, a fast Fourier transformation of simul- taneously monitored transducer time histories from any two points in the system can be used to obtain the frequency response functions relating those two points. In the case of two accelera- tions, such as the right fourth rib acceleration and the left fourth rib acceleration, a trans- formation of the form X (iu) = F Awít)) F A*4l(t)) can be calculated from the transformed quan- tities, where cü is the given frequency, and Ar4R and Ar4i are the Fourier transforms of the right fourth rib acceleration time history and the left fourth rib acceleration time his- tory . RESULTS Using both the linear and ballistic pen- dulums with a 25 kg free-moving impacting mass, a total of twenty-four tests were performed on five cadavers. Using the 5&amp; kg impactor a total of seven cadavers were tested. Table 1 shows the initial conditions of the test subjects and the type of padding used, as well as the impac- tor velocity, for the six test subjects in which a 25 kg impactor was used. For the seven tests in which a $6 kg impactor was used the impact velocity was A. 6 m/s. No padding was placed on the impactor, and the impactor made contact with the test subject A cm below the acromion. Tables 2 and 3 give the peak thoracic accelera- tions and forces are given in Table A. An autopsy summary for each test is shown in Table 5. Head response summary is given in Table 6 including both angular and linear velocities and accelerations, as well as HIC. Table 7 presents peak accelerations of the spine and mid-sternum for mid-velocity impacts. Table 8 gives peak pressures for the pressurized tests. DISCUSSION The results presented in this paper on thoracic impact response are from several research programs conducted during the past three years. The data is presented in an ab- breviated form to show those trends which are felt to be representative of important factors in thoracic impact response. Although a detailed analysis of the response of the thorax to blunt impact from all directions and energy levels is beyond the scope of this paper, the response associated with low-energy impact from three different directions, as well as lateral impact at differing available impact energy levels, is investigated. The response of the thorax to blunt impact is observed from (1) the contact force-time his- tory of the impact piston; (2) accelerations ob- tained from the triaxial acce 1 erometer clusters and uniaxial acce 1 erometer s fitted to the thoracic skeletal structure; and (3) analysis of the high-speed photok i nemetr i es . The various accelerations are subsequently expressed as vec- tors and described in the appropriate reference frames. While general trends are observed in a majority of the impact tests, the specific response is found to depend on several ex- perimental parameters of the impactor device. The velocity of the impactor, the padding of the impact surface, and the direction of impact with respect to the test subject are factors in the type of response observed. FORCE-TIME HISTORY -- A total of nineteen tests were conducted with a 2 m/s impactor velocity. Tests 82E00A-006, 82E023-026, 82EO43-47 , 82EO63-65, 83 E 1 04- 1 06 , and 83EIO8 comprise this test series in which five dif- ferent cadavers were impacted with a 26 kg pis- ton padded with 0.5 cm Ensolite. The tests are divided into four groups depending on the impact direction and the position of the arms: frontal sternum tap, A50 thoracic rib cage tap, lateral tap to the arms, and lateral tap to the thoracic</page><page sequence="8">4.426 G.

The force-time histories are derived from either the acceleration of the linear pendulum piston or the compensated force of the pneumatic impact device. For the nineteen tap tests, the peak force varies from O.A to 1.2 kN and is ap- proximately 60 to 120 milliseconds in duration. The impact force typically reaches its peak value in the initial 1/3 of the force trace and then decreases in magnitude, although exceptions were noted, with some tests resulting in a multimodal response and one or more local maxi- ma. In general, the characteristics of the force-time waveforms seem to be as closely as- sociated to a given test subject as the direc- tion of impact or the position of the test sub- jects. An example is shown in Figure 6 as a comparison of tests 82E023-82E026 and 82EOA3-82EOA6 . This observation is surprising in light of certain test configurations where the impactor did not act directly upon the thorax but through the shoulder and arm. In the second series of tests, seven test subjects were laterally impacted with a rigid (no padding) 56 kg impact piston traveling at A. 6 m/s (tests 80L093, 8OLIOO, 8OLIO7, 80L112, 8OLII7, 8OLI22, and 8OL 1 27) . The time history of the axial force varies from 2 to 3-3 kN and lasts 50 to 100 milliseconds in duration. The force traces are similar to the 2 m/s taps, al- though the multimodal waveforms are more pronounced at A. 6 m/s impacts. An example is given in Figure 7- The shear force obtained for the biaxial load cell is negligible in com- parison to the axial force at impact and, in generai, remains less than a quarter of the axial force during the impact time interval. A peak shear force is not observed until after the peak axial force occurs. In test 82L027» one of a series of lateral impact tests conducted with a 26 kg piston traveling at 8.5 m/s, the force-time history is multimodal with a peak force of 9-8 kN occurring in the first 1/10 of the impact event; the con- tact time of the rigid impactor is 60 mil- liseconds. In test 82LOA8, 10 cm of Ensolite (AL) is used as padding on the impactor and the resulting force-time history is unimodal in its waveform with a peak force of 7 kN. ACCELERATION TIME HISTORY - A rigorous comparison of the acceleration response between different points on the thorax is not possible due to the complex nature of the thoracic skele- tal response. Differences in the waveform of the acceleration time history at the various in- strumented points of the thorax, as well as the particulars of the impact conditions, limit the analysis to certain characteristics of the response found to be independent of the direc- tion of impact. The gross overall motion of the thorax during impact is in the general direction of im- pact, although some rotations are observed about the R-L axis for frontal impacts and, for side impacts, about the l-S and P-A axes. The over- all motion is determined from the high-speed films and transducer time histories. Figure 8 is a photographic reconstruct i on of a lateral impact indicating the general motion observed in this type of test. A comparison of the in- tegrated time history for the principal direc- tion of the nearside acce 1 erometer cluster for the 2 m/s i mpacts--s ternum for frontal and RAL (Rib A, left side) for side and A5°--and the velocity of the phototargets indicate that they are in reasonable agreement near the end of im- pact; however, it must be noted that errors introduced in the integration of the acceleration-time history, as well as errors as- sociated with obtaining the differentiated mo- tion of the phototargets from a two-dimensional image, limit the comparison. Peak velocities obtained from the principle direction accelera- tion for the nearside triaxes are typically I-I.5 m/s for the 2 m/s impacts. Although the gross motion of the thorax can be described in a general sense from the acceleration-time history of the principal direction, a one-dimensional response is not sufficient to describe the acceleration-time history of several of the instrumented points on the thorax. However, a secondary direction is found such that no significant acceleration can be found in the third direction for these points. This implies that, in general, a description of the acceleration response of cer- tain of the points on the thoracic skeletal structure requires an "acceleration plane". Figure 9 shows the transducer time histories of the RAL for test 82E006 for the principal (Al), secondary (A2) , and resultant (AR) accelera- tions, as well as the integration of the prin- cipal (VI) and secondary (V2) directions. Sig- nificant accelerations in at least two direc- tions for several points are observed in a majority of the tests, regardless of the direc- tion of impact. The magnitude of peak acceleration and the time at which the maxima occurs are found to be dependent on the acce 1 erometer location relative to the point of impact. The peak acceleration of a point nearest to impact is typically three to four times greater in magnitude than the point furthest from impact. In addition, the relative phasing of the peak acceleration be- tween the nearside and farside of impact is se- quential with the occurrence of the peak force. In general, the peak and resultant accelerations of the near s i de--upper and lower sternum for frontal impacts and RAL and RSA (Rib 8, left side) for lateral i mpacts--occur s prior to the peak force. The peak and resultant accelera- tions for those points further from impact generally occurs after the peak force: RAR (Rib A, right side)/R8R (Rib '8, right side) and RAL/ R8L for frontal impacts, the upper and lowe^ sternum and T1 and T12 for lateral impacts. The side impacts display the largest lag in peak ac-</page><page sequence="13">THORACIC RESPONSE 4.431 Figure 6: Force Time Histories 200-Hz, 4th Order Filier.

The observed lag between peak force and peak acceleration is as much as 10 milliseconds for the farside of impact (Figure 10). The waveforms of the principle acceleration time history for frontal and side impacts seem to be relatively similar for the nearside (upper sternum for frontal impacts and RAL and RSI for lateral impacts) for a given impact velocity, although there are exceptions (test 82 E06 3) • The acceleration waveform of the nearside, in general, is characterized by a smooth rise up to peak acceleration, proceeding to a negative ac- celeration near peak force, and subsequently either becomes positive and returns to negative or remains negative. On the other hand, the farside acceleration response is more complex before peak acceleration. Either a multimodal waveform with several local maxima or a delay between the initiation of impact and the most significant part of the acceleration response is observed. In addition a lower peak acceleration lags behind the nearside peak acceleration. Physically, these observations imply that the response of the thorax to blunt impact can be interpreted as the response of one deformadle body (the thorax) in contact with other material bodies (arm, neck, impactor, etc.). The waveform which is associated with the accelera- tion response of each point on the thorax is therefore influenced by the force input (ob- tained through the use of an impactor in this case) and the physical characteristics of the thorax. For those points near the point of im- pact, the acceleration response is influenced by the external driving force. For those points distal to the point of impact, the response is more related to a system response. This may in part explain why other researchers (A, 23) see a relative similarity of response of test subjects for the nearside acce 1 erometer s and the greater variation for the farside response. IMPACT RESPONSE -- Figures 11-14 represent the mechanical impedance magnitude transfer function for test subject no. 3- The results shown in these figures are generated from the principal direction triad and contain four data traces, one each for RAL, RAR, the upper ster- num, and T1 . The impact surface was padded with .5 cm of Ensolite (AL) and the results of the following multiple impacts are shown: front sternum tap, A5° tap, arms up lateral tap, and arms down lateral tap. The results presented here are considered representative of general trends observed in a majority of the tests. The impact response of the thorax as ob- served in the mechanical impedance results have the following characteristics: 1) local minima in impedance are observed in all significant ac- celerations in the anatomical reference frames or the principal direction triad and the uniaxial acce 1 erometer s ; 2) the magnitude of mechanical impedance of the nearside to impact decreases up to the first local minima; 3) a second local minima is observed for most tests at approximately twice the frequency of the first minima; and A) for those points further from the point of impact, a greater value of the mechanical impedance is observed from 10 Hz up to the first local minima. Only one local minima, however, is observed in the arms-up lateral impacts. The minima of the mechanical impedance response tend to appear within certain frequency ranges. In the frontal impacts, the minima range from 32-38 and 65-8O Hz; lateral impacts result in minima from A2-A8 Hz and 8O-IOO Hz; and for A5° impacts, minima are observed between 2 7 ~ 3 2 Hz and 57~66 Hz. The decrease in impedance up to the first local min- ima exhibit a "spring-like" characteristic for many of the front and side impacts. Although the magnitude of the mechanical impedance indi- cates that a spring constant f^r the thorax could be between 3*10 to 8x10 N/m , the phase of these transfer functions, however, do not ex- hibit a spring-like behavior (Figure 15)- In certain tests, the magnitude of the mechanical impedance for the farside acceleration rises as a mass line of 15~25 kg up to the first local minima. However, similar to the spring-like be- havior of the nearside, the phase of the trans- fer functions are not mass-like (Figure 15)* The local minima observed in all tests is not necessarily related to resonances of the thorax system (in terms of free vibrations). During the occurrence of the peak acceleration, the impactor is still in contact with the test subject. In addition, the amount of area of the impactor in contact with the test subject varies for different directions of impact. This may, in part, cause the differences in local minima of mechanical impedance for different impact directions as well as different initial condi- tions (arms-up, arms-down). The response of the thorax can be further generalized by the nearside and farside mechani- cal impedance results of the low-energy (2 m/s) impacts. In the frequency range at 10-35 Hz, the magnitudes of impedance of the nearside are consistently lower than the farside impedance magnitudes. Physically, the lower impedance values of the nearside indicate that there is less resistance to the external driving force at the point of impact. A decreasing impedance up to the first minima is previously ascribed to an "e 1 as t i c- 1 i ke" response for the nearside, versus a "mass-like" farside response related to gross whole body motion. These results are consistent with the observed acceleration response and serve to qualify the observed differences in ac- celeration waveforms of the nearside and far- side. At low-velocity, therefore, the thorax seems to absorb the energy of impact by deform- ing to the action of the piston in a non- damaging way and subsequently rebounds with</page><page sequence="16">4.434 G- s* NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. 100-Hz. 4th Order H 70. % Causal Filier.

SECONDARY DIRECTION OF ACCELERATION - An example of the impedance characteristics of the secondary direction acceleration are shown in Figure 16 for test 82E026. In general, the mag- nitudes of impedance of the secondary direction are higher in the low frequency range below the first local minima, than the principal direction impedance magnitudes. At the local minima, the principal and secondary direction impedance values are similar. At higher frequencies, the secondary direction impedance magnitudes tend to be greater than the principle direction, but not to the same level as observed prior to the first mi n ima . TRANSFER FUNCTIONS - One of the goals of the present study is to quantitatively charac- terize the response of the thoracic skeletal structure in terms of a transfer function be- tween any two points on the thorax which possess a significant component of acceleration. In this regard, transfer functions are generated between any given acceleration package and any other given acce 1 erometer package, resulting in a number of transfer functions for each point which generate the cor respond i ng response of every other point. An example of an application of this approach is the use of the nearside principal direction response to predict the far- side principal direction response, as shown in Figure 17» where the transfer functions for the farside and nearside are generated for a sternum impact (test 82L043) , and three lateral impacts (tests 82L045, 82L046, and 82L047) . When a transfer function is generated between any two points such that the denominator is obtained from the acce 1 erometer package nearest to im- pact, the transfer function has the characteris- tics of a low-pass filter. Transfer functions which are generated further from the point of impact display an increasingly greater attenua- tion. In the case of lateral impacts, the transfer functions which are generated from the nearside principal direction acceleration and the upper sternum principal direction accelera- tion have less attenuation than the correspond- ing transfer function of TÌ or lower sternum for the P-A direction. This seems to indicate that there is a load path through the arm and shoulder (via the clavicle) to the thorax and that the sternum, in particular, is influenced by such a load path. In general, the transfer functions which are generated from the significant acceleration components of the various points of the thorax result in responses typified as decreasing in magnitude with increasing frequency and varying in phase at each different frequency. Therefore, if it is reasonable to assume that the thorax is a deformable structure, the response of the thorax is dependent on the load path and the energy management of the system (gross motion, differential motion, or dissipa- tion). In these tests, a sufficient area of contact has been maintained to eliminate such effects as loading on a single rib. The trans- fer functions which are obtained in this study, therefore, should be regarded as characteristic of blunt impact involving large areas of the thorax and are not necessarily general to other types of thoracic loading. HIGH VELOCITY IMPACTS - In the seven lateral impacts conducted with asrigid 5&amp; kg ï m- pactor piston traveling at 4.5 m/s, the ac- celerometers were located on the mid-sternum and T6 on the test subjects. The mechanical im- pedance results of these tests are similar to the low-velocity impacts with the exception that the local minima occur at consistently higher frequencies. Figure 18 shows the mechanical im- pedance for some of these tests. The shift of the minima to higher frequencies may be related to either a velocity dependence of the thorax, as suggested by others (27»30), or an artifact of the damage produced in some of the tests. (Damage patterns are observed in three of the seven subjects impacted.) In tests 82E027 and 82E048, the 26 kg im- pactor had a velocity of 8.5 m/s. In test 82E027» a rigid impact, the shoulder structure was destroyed by damage to the clavicle as well as 11 fractures to the rib cage. The impedance of the farside of impact shows a mass-like response similar to the low-velocity impact of the nearside for the same subject, but the first local minima is at 120 Hz (Figure 19). In test 82E048, 10 cm of padding was placed on the im- pactor surface and only four rib fractures are observed. The mechanical impedance response is similar to the mid-velocity impacts with the first local minima occurring at 52 Hz. In general, the transfer functions that are generated between the nearside and farside R4 principal directions and associated with the rigid impacts for tests 82E027 and 82E066 have less attenuation than were observed in the low velocity impacts and padded impacts at the 8.5 m/s velocity (Figure 20). Physically, this im- plies that the thorax structure could have been effectively stiffer for these tests at higher velocities. A similar observation had been made previously (24,32) when it was suggested that the thorax stiffens under higher impact velocity. It should be noted, however, that the velocity of the linear piston constantly changes during the impact event and that energy manage- ment of the thoracic structure for a given im- pact mass may actually be the intrinsic factor relating the thorax response to the impact vel oc i ty .

For lateral impacts at different im- pact energy levels, resulting in differing degrees of damage to the skeletal structure, the response changes in both the time histories and the frequency domain (e.g., the local minima in the mechanical impedance transfer function oc- curring at higher frequency). This implies that a single linear model may be inadequate to characterize thoracic impact response for all impact energy levels. However the changes in response seem to be consistent and analytically deser i bab 1 e . DAMAGE RESPONSE In tests 82EO27 and 82E066, rigid lateral impacts at 8.5 m/s with the 26 kg piston produced damage to the clavicle and thoracic rib cage in both test subjects. The addition of 10 cm of padding to the impact surface resulted in no injuries sustained to the shoulder-arm- clavicle complex with fewer rib fractures in four subsequent tests at 8.5 m/s with the 26 kg piston (tests 82E007, 82EOA8, 82E107). Poten- tially, if the shoulder structure remains in- tact, it could be an effective means by which the load to the thorax is better distributed. Three out of seven test subjects impacted laterally at A. 6 m/s with the rigid 56 kg piston experienced damage to the ribs. The approximate velocity at which a rigid impact to the shoulder should begin to produce damages to the thoracic skeletal structure seems to be A. 6 m/s. In this test series, no injuries were ob- served in the neck of any of the test subjects. CONCLUSIONS This has been a limited, preliminary study, using unembalmed cadavers, of some important kinematic factors and damage modes of the thoracic skeletal structure associated with blunt impact of the thorax. Because of the complex nature of the thorax during an impact event, more work is necessary before these kinematic factors can be general- ized to describe thoracic skeletal response. However the following conclusions are drawn. 1. For lateral impacts a single linear model seems inadequate to characterize thoracic impact response for all impact velocities. In terms of mechanical impedance (generated between various points on the thoracic skeletal struc- ture and the impact force) as well as transfer functions (generated between points on the thoracic cage), there seems to be a significant difference between low velocity (non-damaging) and high velocity (damaging) impact responses. 2. In low-energy, non-damaging impacts (2 m/s with a 26 kg impactor) the response of the subjects seems to have certain characteristics in both the time and frequency domain that are similar for all impact directions. In general the thorax acts as a deformable body during blunt impact with the transmitted energy parti- tioned as both differential and gross whole body- motion. In particular, the nearside and farside responses differ with greater deformation oc- curring at the nearside locales. Similarities are seen between the impact responses of the different nearside locales (left side for lateral impacts and sternum for frontal impacts) and between the different farside locales (right side for lateral impacts and spine for frontal). 3. The description of three-dimensional acceleration of select points on the skeletal structure is invaluable to the understanding of thoracic impact response. The results obtained from a single dimensional descriptor (such as r i ght- to- 1 ef t acceleration velocity or displace- ment for lateral impacts) seems inadequate to characterize thoracic impact response. A. Damage to the skeletal structure of a cadaver is initiated during unpadded rigid im- pacts in which the thorax is loaded through the shoulder arm complex at an impact velocity be- tween A-5 m/s using a 56 kg impactor mass. 3. Energy absorbing and load distributing materials are effective methods of reducing the amount of damage to the thoracic skeletal struc- ture in lateral impacts to the shoulder arm com- plex.
