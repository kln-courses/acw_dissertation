<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Systematic Theolagy. Volume I. PAUL TnLIcH. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1951. xi, 300 pp. $5.00. This is the first volume of a "theological system" which pre- sumably will go over into an additional volume or two. But so far as I can judge, the present book is self-contained and is in- tended to be read for itself. It has three parts: (a) an extended and very meaty dissertation on the nature of theology, which serves as an introduction to the entire project; (b) a discussion of knowledge, particularly religious knowledge, entitled "Reason and Revelation"; (c) lastly an ontological section called "Being and God." Topics not included in this volume and presumably to constitute the remaining part of this work are announced to be the following: I. Existence and Christ; II. Life and the Spirit; III. History and the Kingdom of God. The scope of this project is ambitious and the achievement, so far, remarkable. So far as I can judge from present accomplishment, this work, when finished, will be an important contribution to theology. What should make the book of interest to the readers of this JOURNAL is the fact that, as the author says in the preface, he has tried to present his system "in a continuous correlation with phi- losophy." I will largely limit myself to philosophical considera- tions in this review. I should add that the author is most learned philosophically, having read his philosophers first-hand and mastered them. Professor Tillich speaks as a Christian and his theological system is a Christian system; he is a Protestant, of course, and if I had to describe his position in one word, I would call it existentialist, but only in the sense implied in the following quotation: " Only those propositions are theological which deal with their object in so far as it can become a matter of ultimate concern for, us" (p. 12). The religious predicament is that of human anxiety arising from the threat of not-being; the meaning of God in human experience (if I may borrow Professor Hocking's phrase) is that God will dominate and turn back the encroachments of not- being upon man's condition. But equally, if not more charac- teristic of the author's mentality is his dominantly dialectical in- terpretation of reality and of Christian doctrine.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 693 Beyond my interest in the author's particular theology is my wider concern for theology as such. Why should a philosopher be interested in theology? Are there any valid theological prob- lems? May not theology be the projection of phantasy? Note that such questions are not usually raised about natural science. Whether one be a scientist or not or, if one be a philosopher, no matter to what school he may belong, one entertains no doubts as to the validity of science, and one does not question the importance of the philosophy of science. But philosophical theology is an altogether different matter; the discipline has first to justify itself bv showingf that it has genuine subject-matter. Is this anything more than a prejudice-more than the reversal of the medieval prejudice against natural science? After all, Newton regarded theological questions as significant; he was a theologian as well as a scientist. That we are dealing with preju- dice can be shown, I think, from a contemplation of Hume's way of dealing with scientific and with theological opinions respectively. He showed, to his satisfaction, that theistic views are "beliefs" and not knowledge. (I am leaving out of consideration the last book of his dialogues on religion.) There is no evidence, he said, for the existence of God and much of the evidence is against such a view. Hume also reflected on the logic of scientific induction and on such a basic scientific premise as the belief in causation. He concluded, to his satisfaction, that the logic of induction is invalid and that there is no evidence justifying the belief in causation. So far so good. Then Hume realizes that he cannot endure such a sceptical position as a prolonged state of mind; it is against human nature. So he comes back to his faith in causality and greneral law; indeed, when he discusses human action he is most explicit in his rejection of free will and in his assertion of de- terminism. But he does not restore his faith in God and in a moral order of the universe. Why not? I can find no reason whatever. Both beliefs-in the existence of causal order and in the existence of moral order-are faiths, as he shows; both are irrational (he thinks), justified neither by experience nor by the relations of ideas. Yet, having proceeded to abandon his scepti- cism concerning natural science, he goes on regarding religion as superstition to the end. Our current anti-attitude to theology is not different from Hume's prejudice against it. As I have already said, Professor Tillich finds the essence of the Christian consciousness in the ultimate co-ncern for one's being-in anxiety, in the sense of insecurity, in the pervading environment of not-being of which death is the most vivid in-</page><page sequence="3">694 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY stance. Courage is, if not the highest, the most representative virtue. (But is this not more of a pagan than a Christian view?) The religious outlook is that of tension and tragedy along with the conviction of ultimate fulfilment expressed in the phrase (re- peatedly quoted by the author) from the New Testament that "nothing can separate us from the love of God." I would also cite the magnificent statement of Job: "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." Here we find a trust in God which, far from being the expression of simple optimism, exists together with and despite an awareness of tragic possibilities. Now, the temper of this country has on the whole been opti- mistic, and the American reader may feel the tone of this book to be strange and alien. In this country, we believe in success, and tend to make-believe that there are no failures. Our phi- losophy is one of production, of accomplishment, and of progress. Moreover, it is a philosophy which, in many ways, has been justi- fied by its fruits. Yet our experience with the recent wars and our enforced immersion in the stormy waters of international af- fairs are having their influence on the national outlook. We are learning that perhaps there are evils which are irremediable, that conflicts and tensions are inevitable and perhaps of the very essence of human living. So it is to be hoped that the public is readier now to accept Professor Tillich's message than it might have been earlier. A question may, however, be raised whether the author does justice to all sides of the Christian attitude or the religious atti- tude in general. James, I think, was right in distinguishing (in his incomparable Varieties) two kinds of genuinely religious people: the twice-born and the once-born. Now it seems to me that Professor Tillich's account applies to the former and ignores the latter. The twice-born type is the one that experiences con- flicts and tensions; he is a divided soul, and virtue for him is a state which comes only after a violent wrenching, a conversion from sin, a rejection of the natural self. The once-born type is not turbulent, not self-conflicting, not dominated by tensions; in- stead of having a sense of estrangement, he is inwardly harmonious, integrated, gradualistic in his growth rather than revolutionary. Indeed the once-born man is hardly religious in any conscious sense; he doesn't talk much even to himself about his inner self or his sins, and may not even have a distinct consciousness of God, although, of course he believes in God's existence, prays to him, and consciously strives to obey God's commandments. But he has one thing above all, and that is religious being; he lives the re-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 695 ligious life. And it is because he practically incorporates the divine in his own being that he is so dimly aware of it. The danger of the once-born type is complacency and even blindness, just as the virtue of the twice-born type is intensity of awareness. But the danger of the latter type is self-dramatization and romantic emotion-a sense of tragedy and sin for its own sake. I repeat, with diffidence, that the author's approach to re- ligion is by a study of the twice rather than the once-born, and to that extent, he seems to me one-sided. He makes more of the crucifixion than either the birth or the resurrection of Jesus; and, in his references to God, makes more of the "abyss" in the Divine Nature, more of God's transeendenee, than of his nearness to man. But of this later. The book is rich with insights on a very great variety of prob, lems, theological, cultural, and humanistic; the author's mind is both deep and wide. To choose some samples at random: his account of the various meanings of love, leading up to the Chris- tian agape, his discussion of the relation of love and justice, his interpretation of divine providence, his most sympathetic and il- luminating account of polytheism-in all of these and many others, we find a meditative and rich light playing over the shadows. The author has an intuitive understanding of religious phenomena and an ability to transmit this understanding to the reader. But the book, it must be said, is difficult to read-and this for two reasons. First because the author sees the problem in all its com- plexities, because, in short, he is profound; second, because the book is abstract, too much so. The author possesses a decided gift for arresting images; but these, too often, become lost in the massive clouds of abstraction which surround them. The philosophical reader would like to know whether Professor Tillich is a rationalist or not. In giving a brief answer now I will be anticipating later, more detailed discussion. Another pre- liminary point is that rationalism is a vague term; I will assume that rationalism is consistent with the acceptance of immediacy at one extreme and of presuppositions at the other. Certainly the intention of the author is to expound a rationalistic theology, in the sense of a theology consistent with rationalism. As already said, the author is constantly appealing to the philosophic tradition and to philosophic inquiry. Two minor and two major reserva- tions may be noted to the author's rationalism. To begin with the former: (a) the author, while not a mystic, appeals to mystical experience as one of the data in theology. For, mysticism is a doctrine of experience and theology is empirical. Also, the mysti- cal experience is taken only subject to tests by rational criteria.</page><page sequence="5">696 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY (b) The author denies the possibility of demonstrating the ex- istence of God; thus he rejects the so-called rational proofs. But as I will show later on in this article, this does not involve an appeal to faith as a support of religious belief; rather, the author views the existence of God as a theological presupposition. Now, as to the major reservations. The author says that noth- ing can happen in history and nature which violates the laws of formal logic. All reality is accessible to reason, for there is no being without structure or form. Yet (a) hu?man reason is viti- ated by the fall and unable to grasp absolute truth. Hence man must rely on revelation. (In his stated contrast between "actual" and "essential" reason, the author sounds a theme of Platonism which haunts the entire book.) In developing the doctrine of revelation the author makes excellent use of classical Greek phi- losophy. He reminds us that the latter distinguished between ousia (reality) and appearance; between the "true being" of things on the one hand, and changing appearances and unfounded opinions on the other (p. 101). Things hide their true being be- hind sensory impressions; hence knowledge is not a simple act of seeing but involves a process of uncovering or of revealing. Thus (I would add) the Greek word for truth (aletheia) means un- hiddenness. The author does not claim that the Greek philosophers believed in divine revelation; but he shows in brilliant fashion how the Greek contrast between reality and appearance can be used to explain the Christian doctrine of divine revelation. Finite reason cannot pierce the screen of appearances; thus revelatory knowledge is achieved by the aid of Jesus conceived as the Logos. It would appear from the above that pure being is accessible to ideal or infinite or unfallen reason. Yet the author's position is ambivalent. Since being has a structure, being is ideally in- telligible; yet since being transcends structure, it remains finally mysterious to all reason. (Here I am not absolutely sure of my interpretation of the author's views.) The trouble with reason is that it separates meaning from being whereas being itself is beyond the split. Hence (b) pure rational conceptions are inadequate for theological purposes; we must employ symbols and symbolic con- ceptions. The author makes striking remarks about the composition and the operation of reason. He goes back to the classical position that reason is not merely apprehensive but includes emotional and volitional elements. To know the good is at the same time to love the good. The author makes a very persuasive case for the Socratic position that knowledge is virtue, since knowledge means the operation of all the powers of the mind including the will. I</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 697 would add that the contemporary ethical positivism with its defi- nition of ethical meanings in terms of emotive and imperative elements is a revival of the Socratic doctrine, although from the other end of the philosophical scale. All this seems sound so far as ethical knowledge is concerned. But what can the author mean in saying that all knowledge has volitional-emotional elements-for instance, factual or scientific knowledge? Does he mean that in apprehending, say, Boyle's law, I am impelled to act in some fashion? (a) If the author means that all knowledge is for action (pragmatism), the answer is that there is such a thing as a pure theoretical interest in cognition- for instance, intellectual curiosity. Contemplation, meditation have their own intrinsic value. Or (b) the author may mean the idealistic doctrine that in knowledge the mind is constructive. For instance he expounds at some length the view that, in knowing, reason is both "grasping" and "shaping," both receptive and active. I don 't think he intends to say that shaping is a component of the operation of knowing itself, but I must say I don't find him as explicit on this matter as the circumstances demand.1 But if he does mean that in knowing the mind constructs (shapes) its ma- terial (which is in effect the Kantian-Idealistic position), I would in turn ask the author whether in all consistency he should not admit that the above idealistic doctrine is one which the mind has constructed (rather than discovered to be the case). The most basic proposition in the author's philosophy, whether in his ontology, or in his theory of knowledge, or in his interpreta- tion of Christianity, is the dialectical principle. All truth, in whatever realm, is regarded as a union of opposites, a tension which is overcome in a synthesis-but a synthesis in which the opposites are preserved while transcended. Life is the unity of separation with union (p. 242); reason is the unity of distance and union (p. 94). Man's choices exhibit freedom and destiny at once. Reality combines the static with the dynamic phases; spirit unites mind and body; God is both temporal and timeless; being is both structural and fluid; and so on. If so, Christianity is closer to the Hegelian than to any other school of philosophy. But what happens to the law of contradic- tion-really the law of non-contradiction--once the dialectical prin- ciple is admitted? The author maintains that the law is preserved. "In dialectics yes and no, affirmation and negation, demand each 1 "We transform reality according to the way we see it, and we see reality according to the way we transform it" (p. 76). What else can the latter half of this sentence mean than a constructional interpretation of knowledgeI</page><page sequence="7">698 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY other. But in formal logic they exclude each other. However there is no real conflict between dialectics and formal logic . . . [In dialectics] the same concept always is used in the same sense; and if the meaning of the concept changes, the dialectician de- scribes in a logically correct way the intrinsic necessity which drives the old into the new" (p. 56). In other words, formal logic ex- presses the static, and dialectics the dynamic phase of being; and in both, the structure of thinking is safeguarded. The statements of opposites in Christian theology are paradoxes, not contradic- tions. "The acceptance of paradox is not the acceptance of the absurd" (p. 57). But how, precisely, does the dialectical affirmation of opposites manage to conform with the principle of consistency? As far as I can gather, it is because dialectics describes a movement (cf. p. 56f). What the author must mean is this: The principle of con- tradiction maintains that p and not-p cannot be true at the same time; but if the object being described has moved, then p and not-p may both be true of it because the contradictory propositions are referring to states of the object at different times. This is all true, but the analogy is made to apply to dialectical movement only be- cause the word movement is used ambiguously. A physical move- ment takes time; but dia-lectical movement ("the inner movement of the divine life") is timeless. In other words, the dialectical affirmation of yes and no is an affirmation at the same time, and thus does violate the law of contradiction, the appearance to the contrary resting on a confusion in the use of the term movement. Then there is further difficulty-this time psychological or pedagogical rather than logical. It may be that the dialectical principle is sound in fact; but I feel strongly that it is a dangerous guide in philosophical thinking. The trouble is that the philosopher will be tempted to desist from analysis and clarification long before it is necessary to do so, and thus will fail to obtain valuable insight and to make useful distinctions. Like Professor Tillich 's, White- head's ontology takes the form usually of the assertion of opposites (for instance, the static and dynamic phases in God's being); but because Whitehead does not appeal to any dialectical principle, he takes great care to show how the opposing phases are in differ- ent respects; thus he carries the work of analysis as far as it will possibly go and preserves the law of contradiction also. For in- stance, the static and dynamic phases are distinguished by White- head as the primordial and consequent natures, respectively, of God. This is only one of several instances that could be mentioned. Let me now consider (by way of example) the problem of</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 699 freedom and destiny as confronted in the book under review. In some sense, man is said to be both free and subject to destiny, but in what sense is never adequately made clear. Now, the reader may recall that James (in "The Dilemma of Determinism") con- fronts the same problem; he, too, suggests that possibly man is subject to destiny as well as being free; at which point James asks himself how this can be, and proposes the analogy of a game of chess between an amateur and a master. The amateur freely chooses his moves yet his defeat at the hands of the master-able to anticipate and forestall all the moves of the amateur-is in- evitable. Professor Tillich may reply that James simplifies too much; that, in fact, the "how" of the union of opposites in this case is a mystery. But my objection lies elsewhere. The philosopher should make the attempt to clarify, and should not admit mystery until after the most strenuous attempt has failed. Otherwise, of course, we might as well give up at the beginning and abandon philosophizing altogether. The author says that destiny "points not to the opposite of freedom but rather to its conditions and limits" (p. 185). Since he associates freedom with the existence of alternatives, he must not mean determinism by destiny; for, according to determinism, the result is uniquely determined. What is, then, the meaning of destiny and why is it at all relevant to freedom? Notice, by the way, that man is said to have a general as well as a special destiny; that is to say, destiny refers to a universal pattern. Perhaps the following passage contains a clue to the answer: destiny is "body, structure, psychic strivings, spiritual character . . . the communi- ties to which I belong . . . the world which has made an impact on me . . . all my former decisions . . . it is myself as given, formed by nature, history and myself" (p. 185). I suggest that by destiny the author means whatever is determinate in nature and man, whether determined by previous human decision or given; destiny then is a condition of freedom, because in order to be able to choose at all, I must be a determinate somebody. In what sense, then, am I free? Because my actions are not uniquely entailed, given the situation and myself. Determinateness does not entail determinedness; the fact that I am a determinate being issuing into actions does not mean that my actions issue from my being in accordance with any general law. All this, of course, is specu- lation as to what the author may mean and might have said, had he pressed the analysis. In fact, he did not make the required effort.</page><page sequence="9">700 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY According to the author, God, while in fact transcending the finitude of man's estate, yet can be best understood in terms of his relation to man. God is what he means to me; he is the answer to my basic anxieties. To believe in God is to make courage possible, " a courage which accepts and overcomes the anxiety of categori- cal finitude" (p. 209). In other words, the meaning of God is quasi-pragmatic; and the relativity of God is to man rather than to nature. God is known better through man than through na- ture; God is pure being and such being is but faintly discerned in man's own existential nature, yet much less faintly than in the other beings of the universe. Thus the best way of representing God is in analogy with man; God is "living," God is a "spirit," God is "love," God is a "person." Nevertheless (to repeat) the pragmatic aspect of the meaning of God is wholly inadequate to his full nature. There is the beyondness of God: God is the " depth or abyss of being. " Consequently, the anthropomorphic terms must be ascribed to God only in symbolic fashion; and of these symbolic terms, that of Spirit is the most adequate (p. 249). Here, the author is undoubtedly in genuine accord with ordi- nary Christian usage; "God is a Spirit" is the proposition most commonly used to describe God. But consider now the meaning which the author puts into that familiar (though vague) word. Spirit, he says, stands for the unity of all the polar opposites: of power with meaning, of the static with the dynamic, even of mind with body (pp. 249-251). Surely he is abusing language here, for if religious common sense means anything in saying that God is a spirit, it means that God is imulmaterial. I think that the re- sponsibility for such unnatural changes of meaning must be charged to the dialectical principle, which necessitates that a given meaning should embrace its opposite. I doubt that any precision of mean- ing-indeed any meaning-is possible under such conditions. Imagine a person violating the law of his country but who at the moment of such action also transfers his allegiance to another country. Then imagine this person violating the law of his new country but simultaneously changing nationality again. Allegi- ance becomes a meaningless word in such a situation because a citizen can never conceivably be charged with violating it. Like- wise, laws can have no authority, for at the moment that they are disobeyed they fail to apply. In short, we can no longer speak of rules determining the meaning of a word. Incidentally, there should be also limits to the way in which concrete meanings are used symnbolically. Take the author's sym- bolic interpretation of the phrase that God is love. There is, we</page><page sequence="10">BOOK REVIEWS? 701 are told, the universal principle of "individualization and partici- pation," the polarit-y whereby "every life-process unites a trend toward separation with a trend toward reunion. The unbroken unity of these two trends is the ontological nature of love" (p. 279). The author insists that divine love must be defined onto- logically and not emotionally. In short, love is just the dialectical principle of the union of opposites. How it is meaningful to call such a factual law "love" I fail to see. On this basis, the pull of gravity is love also. The author's use of the word love in this connection inevitably reminds one of the love (and strife) of Empedocles, who meant by "love" no more than the attraction of the elements for one another. The author gives a wholly admirable account of the tension, in our conception of God, between the elements of concreteness and ultimacy. On the one hand, man is unable to be concerned with something which cannot be encountered concretely; on the other hand, man cannot be concerned ultimately with anything concrete. There is thus a conflict between the notion of God as ultimate and infinite and that of God as concrete and personal. Here the author is most suggestive in his interpretation of the development of re- ligious thought. Theologians stress monotheism always, yet popu- lar religion is inescapably polytheistic because the public demands emphasis on the concreteness of the divine. By giving a literal interpretation of the phrase "creation out of nothing," Professor Tillich is led to a novel (at least to the reviewer) and illuminating theory of the created world, inclusive of man. The phrase is taken to mean that God creates the world out of not-being; hence human nature (and all nature) is consti- tuted by not-being; natural existence is a limitation of being; and man, just because of his heritage of not-being, is afflicted with anxiety, striving, and imperfection. Moreover, the author identi- fies creation (of finite being) with the fall (p. 257) and here the thoughtful reader is perplexed. Creation, says the author, has no ulterior purpose; it occurs as the exercise of divine creativity. In other words, God creates because he must, because that is how he is. (The author alludes to both destiny and freedom in this con- nection.) Now, if creation is inevitable, and if the result is inevitably bad (a "fall"), then it follows that God contains a destructive principle. But is it necessary to identify creation and finitude with the fall? Surely the doctrine of Genesis is that the fall came after Adam and Eve were created; if so, the fall repre- sents a moment within the life of the created world. The author would seem to agree, as when he speaks of Adam's innocence before</page><page sequence="11">702 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the fall (p. 259). Indeed he distinguishes between the created goodness of things and their distorted existence (p. 204). Is the creation good or bad; is the fall simultaneous' with or consequent to creation? I have not succeeded in getting clear answers from my reading of the author. I propose that the follow- ing three steps be distinguished in a serial order: (a) the evil of creation or of the coming-to-be of finite beings (assuming for the mo- ment that this is evil) ; (b) the evil of the fall whereby created man, by acquiring the knowledge of good and evil, becomes able to judge for himself and thus becomes relatively independent of God and also estranged from him; (e) the evil arising from the abuse of such freedom-the evil of malice, selfishness, and sin. I find no discussion of the third kind in this book. Indeed it is most surprising that the author devotes but two pages (269-270) to an explicit discussion of the problem of evil-this most baffling of all theological questions. In these two pages the author divides evil into three classes: (a) Physical evil, pain, and death-which, according to him, offer no real problem because they are natural implications of creaturely finitude. Yet surely they are evils, and the fact that they are implicated in the finitude of all creaturely being does not help at all. For if creation is of finitude, and finitude be evil, then God is the creator of evil. (b) Then there is moral evil which is the tragic implication of creaturely freedom. Professor Tillich makes what seems to me a wholly valid point, that, as a creator, God cannot create what is opposite to himself; he must create creative beings, beings which are free, and in so far as they are free, independent and therefore estranged from the ground of being. But as I have hinted earlier, the author does not in any way attempt to show in what way moral evil is implied in freedom. Does man have a sinful nature, or is he good by nature, or is he both? (e) Finally, there is the (apparent) fact of meaninglessness and fu- tility-and this, according to the author, is the only sort of evil which offers genuine difficulties for theological belief. Examples cited by the author are "early death, destructive social conditions, feeble-mindedness and insanity, the undiminished horrors of his- torical existence" -all of these being cases of entities which "are excluded from any kind of fulfilment, even from free resistance against their fulfilment." The author's solution of the problem of evil of this third sort is very difficult to understand, partly be- cause of its excessive conciseness. Such evils are described as "the negativities of creaturely existence." But if so, they are no dif- ferent from the evils of class (a), and the same objections arise</page><page sequence="12">BOOK REVIEWS 703 here that I raised before. But the author hints at an answer to these objections. (A) God himself may be said to participate in the negativities of creaturely existence. God includes within him- self "the finite and, with it, non-being." Does the author mean that the good participates in the bad? (B) "Non-being is eternally conquered and the finite is eternally reunited within the infinity of the divine life." This would mean, if I understand the author, that evil is finally excluded or demolished; hence the good does not participate in the bad. (C) How is such exclusion achieved? "The question of theodicy finds its final answer in the mystery of the creative ground." Is this different from the answer given to Job by God amidst the thunder? I venture to propose the following considerations for any pos- sible Christian theology. An essential feature of Platonism is the doctrine that to actualize an ideal in time and space is to degrade it. In this sense, all creation is tainted. Now, I submit that no one can be both a Christian and a Platonist (in respect of the feature just cited). According to Christianity, creation is a free operation of God; and there can be no justification for such a creative act unless it is assumed that the creature makes a positive contribution to being. If creation is a fall (as Plato holds) then creation makes no sense as a free divine action. I submit, on the contrary, that the Christian doctrine of creation, as opposed to Plato's, is that creation is good (Genesis, chapter 1). This may also be proved from Plato's own accomplishment. For it is in the Phaedo that he has written out his indictment of finite historical existence; now, the Phaedo is a noble piece of work, and it is a product of history. It is not true that nothing good can appear in time; the Phaedo appeared in time, and it is good. Secondly, if everything historical is tainted and relative, if to be temporally actualized is to fall from true being, then, I submit, all meaningfulness and importance are taken out of moral effort, and no genuine difference can be established between the good and the bad man. I will be told that there is still the difference between the relative good and the relative evil; a moral crusade then would be justified in that it would mean the replacement of relative evil by relative good. But the real question is why do anything at all; if historical existence is unavoidably infected, why live at all? As free beings, we have the choice of suicide. To this question I know of no answer except the one given by Plato in the Phaedo, namely that it is for God-not for us-to decide when we shall live and when we shall die; with the accompanying implied provision that God</page><page sequence="13">704 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sends us into this vale of tears so that we may expiate our sins or so that we may strengthen our will. All this may be valid; but if so, I repeat, it affords no ground for any enthusiastic participation in the vital crusade against evil. In taking leave of this topic, I wish to make it explicit that I am not charging the author with Plato's philosophy of history. The author, in fact, does not go into this point in the volume on hand; presumably he will take it up in one of the following volumes. God is defined as "being-itself," or shall I say, beingness; that is to say, God is primarily an ontological concept. God is pure being, the being that Parmenides had in mind when he said that being is, and not-being is not. Is not the author's view, then, the same as the Thomist conception of God as pure act? No, says the author, because the latter is a static concept. I find such an in- terpretation of the Thomist view of God (as the act of existence) surprising; for the latter view derives from the Aristotelian con- cept of being as energeia, activity-surely as dynamic as you please. But I think that by dynamism the author means dialecti- cal movement, and that, of course, is lacking in the Aristotelian- Thomist conception. Nevertheless, as I will try to show, the Tillich and Thomistic views are basically alike, in that they both make the notion of being the primary element in the definition of God. When the author says that God is being-itself he means it literally. Every other adjective or description of God is symbolic; but this one-and only this one-is not. Thus, love, personality, spirit, mind-all these are metaphors for the Divine nature; not so the statement that God is being-itself. There are special reasons why the author uses the phrase being-itself rather than being. God is not a being, "alongside others or above others," for he is the ground of being; hence he is being-itself. "It is as atheistic to affirm the existence of God as it is to deny it. God is being- itself, not a being" (p. 237). Secondly, God transcends the dis- tinction between essence and existence; the latter is a split char- acterizing finite being. He is being-itself (rather than being) in the sense that in him essence and being are united. In relation to the world, God is both abyss and ground-that is, both transcendent and immanent. "Being-itself infinitely tran- scends every being" (p. 237). Also it transcends finite under- standing and, I suppose, it may be said to transcend even under- standing as such, since being-itself stands above (while including) meaning. Yet "on the other hand, finite being participates in being-itself and in its infinity" (ibid.). Here we have the aspect of God as immanent, as the ground of being or, more technically, the "infinite power of being."</page><page sequence="14">BOOK REVIEWS 705 It follows from the above that, strictly speaking, there can be no arguments for the existence of God; the so-called arguments are failures in so far as they claim to be demonstrations (p. 204). "To argue that God exists is to deny him" (p. 205) because any argu- ment to prove existence separates essence from existence. Never- theless, the author maintains that all the three famous arguments are valid if taken as statements of existential questions. His in- terpretation of the ontological argument is particularly instructive. The latter, he says, can be no argument because the awareness of God precedes the question of God. (I am reminded here of the Socratic paradox of learning.) The meaning of the ontological argument is "that an awareness of the infinite is included in man's awareness of finitude." Thus, Professor Tillich has no rational use for natural theology. But the reader must not think that, so far forth, he is irrational- istic or mystical or a faith-addict. He regards the proposition that God exists as a datum or a starting-point for theology. All rational disciplines, including natural science, have their starting-points, whether these last be sensory data or rules of method or assertions. One might say that God's existence functions as a presupposition in the author's theology, just as the inductive principle is assumed in natural science. Is the conception of God as being-itself (Tillich) or as pure act of being (Thomistic) satisfactory ? My first demurrer is purely technical. I don't think it proper to refer to being by a name ("being-itself") in the fashion in which one refers to a particular. Kant showed that being is not an attribute and hence may not be grasped in a concept; so far, I am sure, the author would agree. I will go further and assert that neither can being be denoted or named; for being is not a "that" any more than it is a "what." Being or existence is given only in assertirn, as when I say that "something of a certain sort exists." In this sentence we have three elements: (a) the something, denotable by a name; (b) the certain sort-an adjective or a description given in a concept; (e) existence, indicated by a verb. Moreover these three elements are mutually irreducible; the "that" is other than the "what"; also a something may or may not exist. Now, my objection to the term "being-itself" is that it suggests to the mind a fund or reser- voir out of which one may draw particular drops of being indefi- nitely. In short, the Thomistic-Tillich view treats existence as an "it" or as a "something" to be pointed at, an entity or substance. But existence is not substance; existence is what may be truly or falsely asserted of substance-of a substance described as a sot</page><page sequence="15">706 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and-so. Furthermore, adjectives apply only to nameable entities; a something may be big or little, infinite or finite, statie or dynamic, cause or effect, but, obviously, to apply adjectives to existence (beingness) would be a misuse of language and also a confusion of categories. But let us leave all this aside and take up more substantial considerations. It may seem captious for a philosopher to object to the author's proposed definition of God as unduly philosophical, but that, I am afraid, is what I must do. The conception of God as being-itself (or as act of being) lacks whatever is necessary to make such a concept available for religion and so for theology. It is possible to be so philosophical in one's theology as to cut it off from its roots in religious experience, and that is a charge which can fairly be made against the Tillich-Thomistic definition of God exclusively in terms of being and with no reference what- ever to valuqe. Is it an exaggeration to maintain that the distinctive contribu- tion of religion is its insight into value and the status of value in the real world? To be religious is to ask the question whether existence embodies value; to be a Christian is to believe that value dominates existence. Matthew Arnold's simple, almost platitudi- nous, phrase contains the gist of the matter: God is a power, not ourselves, making for righteousness. Not power alone, nor right- eousness alone, but the blend of the two constitutes the meaning of God. Value by itself is impotent; being by itself is morally indifferent. On the one side, there is Platonism which erects the Idea of the Good (Value) as the sole ultimate principle. On the other side, there is the view of this book which erects beingness as the sole ultimate principle. Neither viewpoint adequately formulates Christian theology. It will be noticed that, for Plato, the Idea of the Good is a source of being; and as we will see, our author regards being as a source of value. I would maintain that the notions of value and being are codrdinate in the meaning of God; each blending with the other but neither being reduced to the other. One may well question what of genuine significance there is in the author's statement that God is being-itself. Everybody knows that there are existing things, and if one wants to speak causally, one can go on and say that there is an existing ground of the existence of everything. But this essentially amounts to no more than the tautology that the universe exists. Spinoza found a universe and called it God. All sensible people grant that the universe is grand, infinite, immense, awesome; but this does not make them</page><page sequence="16">BOOK REVIEWS 707 believers. What one wants to know is whether the universe is good or bad or worse (i.e., morally indifferent), unless one assumed that immensity itself is good-in which case he would be erecting power-politics into a principle of strategy for the universe. It will be recalled that Spinoza speaks of the perfection of the universe, but defines perfection in terms of substance. So, too, our author uses the terms goodness and value (incidentally, how scanty are such references in this book!) but then defines these in terms of being. (To be good means to be; we have noticed already that divine love is declared to be a wholly ontological concept.) Let me proceed to details. Structure (meaning) according to the author is derived from being-itself; in turn, value is derived from structure. Thus value is at a second remove from reality. This is not all, however; value-concepts presuppose the contrast between ideals and actualities, and hence a split between essence and existence; they apply in the creaturely and finite world (pp. 202-204). In other words, value is at a third remove from reality. Value-categories are relegated to the realm of finite being. Pro- fessor Tillich speaks of God as holy; in fact, if I understand him aright, he regards the terms divine and holy as equivalent. Good, you will say, God is not just pure being; he is a being endowed with moral perfection. But wait: the holy means the sacred es- sentially; it stands in contrast with the "righteous" or the "morally good," or with "moral perfection" (pp. 216-217). The chief adjectives which the author uses for God are holiness (in its non-moral connotation), power, mystery, majesty, glory, tremendum, and fascinosuYm. All this seems, to me dangerously romantic-dangerous because it easily slips into a worship of power for its own sake. If we are to save divine power from be- coming despotic power we must cling to the notion of the goodness of God as an irreducible element in his essence. To sum up, neither the Thomistic notion of complete actuality, nor the author's notion of being-itself, nor any other purely ontological notion is adequate for the Christian idea of God. The latter is a synthesis of the two independent concepts of value and being. God has an infinite concern for the good and an infinite power to actualize the good. In this book, the concept of the good suffers the same relative oblivion to which evil too is consigned. Of course the author is sensitive to goodness in its many hues; and of course he is acutely aware of injustice, ugliness, moral taint, and other evils as par- ticular and personal facts. But he does not quite contemplate evil as a challenging general problem, nor does he vest the good with absoluteness. Both good and evil seem obscured in his mind</page><page sequence="17">708 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by the splendor of being-itself. But being as such is innocent; Adam must have become aware of being, even before he had tasted the forbidden fruit, from observing the animals as they passed along in front of him. The author shows little indication in this book of having partaken of the fruit of the tree of the knowl- edge of good and evil. A Christian theologian is faced with a dilemma. Should he formulate its doctrines in definite concepts, he runs a serious risk that valuable insights may be allowed to slip away; should he then have recourse to the idea of mystery, he lays himself open to the charge of obscurantism. Christian truth would seem to lie in an intermediate region between mystery and clear ideas, and may be grasped chiefly by symbolic conceptions, yet without being purely poetic. It is then almost inevitable that any honest attempt to clarify Christian doctrine for philosophers would fall afoul of the strictly philosophical rules. It is in this perspective that some part at least of my criticisms should be viewed. Since in this review-article I have stressed controversy perhaps more than agree- ment, I would like to conclude by emphasizing my great obliga- tions to Professor Tillich's distinguished work, from which I have learned much, not only in the field of theology, but in philosophy itself.
