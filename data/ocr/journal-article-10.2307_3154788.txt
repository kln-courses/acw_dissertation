<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSONAL IDEALISM, PRAGMATISM, AND THE NEW REALISM Philosophy has become remarkably controversial of late. Several significant and vigorous movements of protest have arisen against absolute idealism, the almost unquestioned orthodoxy of the last genera- tion of philosophers in England and America. Three of these movements constitute more or less class-conscious schools of thought, viz., personal idealism, pragmatism, and the new realism. These movements are represented in the three books under review in this article. Dr. Hastings Rashdall's little volume of six lectures' delivered at Cambridge is published as the first of a series of semi-popular "Studies in Theology," edited by Dr. A. M. Fairbairn of Oxford. Dr. Rashdall is a well-known English representative of personal idealism. He differs in some points from others of the same school-from Dr. McTaggart of Cambridge in being a theist, and from Professor Howison of California in being also a creationist. His lectures are intended to serve as an i Philosophy and Religion. By Hastings Rashdall, D.Litt., D.C.L.

Dr. Bawden's book2 undertakes an exposition of the principles of pragmatism, dealing with such topics as experience, consciousness, feeling, thinking, truth, reality, evolution and the Absolute, mind and matter. The author is a former pupil of Professor Dewey, and adheres pretty closely to the Dewey type of pragmatism. The third volume under review3 comprises nineteen essays-some of them of much more than ordinary interest and importance-published in honor of Professor William James of Harvard, by the members of the faculties of philosophy and psychology in Columbia University. The first eight of these essays, by Professors Fullerton, Dewey, Bush, Mon- tague, Woodridge, C. A. Strong, Pitkin, and Miller, consider more or less explicitly, and most of them favorably, the present trend toward realism. We turn first to the volume on Philosophy and Religion. Dr. Rashdall finds value in the cosmological and moral arguments for the existence of God, but, as is usual with idealists, his favorite basis for theism is epistemology. The first step is from common-sense to sub- jective idealism. There is nothing in matter as we know it, it is argued, which does not obviously imply mind; therefore matter can never have existed without mind. This is a glaring instance'of the fallacy of argu- ing from what has been called "the ego-centric predicament "-every- thing which we know is, of course, known; therefore there is nothing that is not known! It sounds like a confession, though intended as an apology, when the author says: "It is for the most part only by a con- siderable course of habituation extending over some years that a man succeeds in thinking himself into the idealistic view of the universe." The next step is to relieve the subjectivism as far as possible, and to complete the theistic argument by introducing the mind of God as a carry-all in which things can exist as ideas when not so existing in the minds of men. Matter cannot exist apart from mind-so the well- worn argument runs-but matter does not exist merely for our minds, which have had a beginning in an already existent universe; therefore there must be a mind possessing universal knowledge.

Our quarrel is not with the religious content of Dr. Rashdall's thought; it is with its proffered philosophical basis. He offers us God, freedom, immortality, revelation, and much of the content of Christian doctrine. But when we are asked to accept all as the gift of episte- mological idealism, we hesitate to receive what looks so much like stolen goods! When will philosophers learn to found theism upon religion instead of upon epistemology ? Turning to Dr. Bawden's book, we find pragmatism defined as "a recent movement of thought which is seeking to do justice to the neg- lected claims of common sense, of religious faith, and of science, in determining a true philosophy of life." One wonders, however, why the author mentions religious faith, for one looks in vain for appeal to any religion and its postulates as a source of metaphysical hypotheses. An extremely attenuated shadow of religion appears where it is asserted: "We do sometimes achieve our ends, get somewhere, accomplish some- thing. To this extent and in this sense it may be said that we are of, with, to, for, in the Absolute." Like Professor Dewey's celebrated "postulate of immediate empiricism," pragmatism, as Dr. Bawden actually employs it, is, in its negative aspect, a device for keeping religious faith from having anything to say, directly or indirectly, in the construction of a philosophy of life. (The strange thing is that when this type of pragmatism is taken over intact by the theologian or philosopher of religion, he so often fails to see that the "God-idea" he talks about is nothing more than the ghost of a dead God!) In strong contrast with idealism, which builds a religious cosmology upon epistemology, Dewey and many of his disciples not only substitute the functional psychology and logic of thinking for the theory of knowledge -which may be well enough-but proceed to discredit in advance all attempts to formulate a systematic cosmology. Such a truncated philosophy as remains is at variance not only with "religious faith" but also with "the claims of common-sense" and "science," for all these forms of thought pass readily and even necessarily over into cosmology. In spite of their protests against the charge of subjec- tivism, pragmatic empiricists of the type under review-pragmatic idealist is what Dr. Bawden rather inaptly styles himself-must be classified as psychological positivists.</page><page sequence="4">IDEALISM, PRAGMATISM, AND THE NEW REALISM 653 In the Principles of Pragmatism it is claimed that the distinction between experience and reality is not ontological but methodological only. The content of experience is reality; the process of reality is experience. Hence there is no sense in speaking of reality beyond experience; even to judge of what is supposed to transcend experience is to relate it to experience at the same time that one gives it place in reality! Consciousness is defined as a transformation phase of experi- ence; it is a certain kind of adjustment between two parts of the uni- verse. The distinction between the physical and the psychical is simply functional; thoughts are things viewed in process of becoming something different from what in relation to the needs of former practice they have been. Professor Dewey's thought seems to be more consciously anti- idealistic and to accommodate itself more deliberately to realism than that of his former pupil. Perhaps this is partly because since leaving Chicago the professor has fallen among realists, but, be that as it may, in his essay in the Columbia volume he takes his stand between the idealists and the realists. Reality, he claims, has practical character. A thing is what it is experienced as, and within the knowing experience a thing is what it is known as; but a thing as known is not what it was as simply experienced; the knowing has introduced into the reality (or experience) a specific, intended change. Knowing neither creates reality (as an extreme idealism would assert), nor does it simply copy it (as a naive realist would have to say); knowing modifies an already existent reality. Any other view is to be regarded as intellectualistic and static. Now there is in this so much vagueness as to just how and how far knowing changes reality that misinterpretation is almost inevitable. Clearness would be gained if the qualities of material things had been classified as primary, involved in the transformations of physical energy which take place in space and time independently of human experience; secondary, belonging to things as experienced through the senses; and tertiary, the cognized meanings belonging to things as known, judged about. Now from the point of view of the next judgment about an object, what functions as its reality has been modified by the preceding judg- ment, as compared with what it would have been without that judg- ment; but these tertiary qualities, or cognized meanings, are the only ones directly changed by the knowing process; the others are changeable, but indirectly, by the liberation of physical energy through the nervous system. When so explained, the view that knowing changes reality avoids subjectivism while retaining a dynamic conception of reality.</page><page sequence="5">654 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY But not only do the realists maintain that knowing reality does not change it (what we have called tertiary qualities belonging, they claim, not to the thing, but to its external relations), but some of them tend to affirm that reality remains unchanged even in its secondary qualities by being experienced. Professor Fullerton gives a cautious and defen- sible statement of the principles of the new realism as follows: All sensa- tion gives experience of the world, the only external world worth talking about being the one revealed in experience; phenomena are the qualities of things; different minds with their different experiences perceive the same things; things when not perceived are yet to be given a place in the objective world-order. One is interested to learn from his previously published System of Metaphysics that Professor Fullerton is a believer in God and immortality, although he does not think it possible or neces- sary for these beliefs to be supported by a philosophical demonstration. In fact, the new realists are ambitious to make philosophy a science, and are decidedly averse to the introduction of religious considerations into its processes. Dr. Bush's paper, for example, is a protest against "spiritualistic idealism" as "a survival of primitive animism," and he complains that modern philosophy has been in the main not free inquiry but Protestant metaphysics. Thus the very element which Eucken regards as of chief value in philosophy-the element of spiritual insight- is what these realists regard as the corrupting factor. Professor Woodbridge's paper examines the philosophical status of epistemology and incidentally gives expression to a realistic point of view. Epistemology is not needed, he claims, as a warrant for the conclusions of science, and the problems of perception are problems of natural science, not of epistemology. The service rendered by the latter is not logical but moral and spiritual only; it is not knowledge which it modifies, but character-although just how it does this is not indicated. Dr. Woodbridge says if there is a physical world external to conscious- ness, there is also a physical world within conscigusness, and yet, although a perceived world is not the same as an unperceived world, the physical world is not two, but one. The perceived world is the real world; the "perception" is the thing. This may be good common-sense as far as it goes, but it leaves some questions unanswered. For example, it leaves unsolved what has come to be known as "the Columbia problem," the problem of the nature of consciousness. As Professor Woodbridge states it in a still more recent publication, it is the problem of "so defining consciousness that provision may be made for the fact that things sail into it and out again without any break in the continuity of</page><page sequence="6">IDEALISM, PRAGMATISM, AND THE NEW REALISM 655 their being," while providing "for the occurrence of consciousness itself as a temporal event." This problem the Columbia professors seem to have inherited from the pragmatists, and particularly from Professor James's epoch-making article of a few years ago, entitled, "Does Consciousness Exist?" Time was when philosophers said con- sciousness was everything; now the tendency is to say that it is nothing existent at all-simply a relation between existent things. Thus the new realism appears as a residue of pragmatism, and an inner reason is found for the dedication of the Columbia volume to Professor James. But another phase of this unsolved problem is the question as to the nature of the things that "sail into consciousness and out again," especially before they entered and after they have left. Shall one be a naive realist or a Kantian agnostic ? Of the four authors whose essays remain to be noticed, Messrs. Montague and Pitkin seem to tend toward the former alternative, and Dr. Miller examines it sympathetically but critically, while Professor Strong's thought is fundamentally Kantian, however much he may try to avoid the agnostic conclusion. Dr. Miller holds that all there is of naive realism is acceptable, viz., that the different spatial aspects of objects seen successively are all real, but that when naive realism is made into a metaphysical theory, requiring one to believe that these aspects seen successively really co-exist in time, the theory is untenable. Such, however, would seem to be the thought of Dr. Pitkin, who claims that experience is a sort of picture of a perma- nently existing real world which is known only at intervals and in a partial fashion. Professor Montague labors to support his thesis that con- sciousness is a form of potential physical energy. To state the view in his own words: "What I, from within, would call my sensations are neither more nor less than what you, from without, would describe as the forms of potential energy to which the kinetic energies of neural stimuli would necessarily give rise in passing through my brain." How- ever fantastic and untenable such a theory may seem, it is based upon the experienced fact that consciousness gives rise to physical changes, and is thus a liberator, and therefore, it would seem, in some measure a creator of physical energy. This potentiality of physical energy in consciousness is very suggestive of a sort of evolutionary creationism in cosmology-a view readily connecting itself with the thought of the immanence of God. Professor Strong's very interesting paper offers "substitutionalism" as a theory of knowledge. This is to the effect that objects are always given or known substitutionally; the perceptive experience is projected</page><page sequence="7">656 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY and substituted for the object as it is in itself. It is an attempt to merge two antagonistic views, viz., common-sense realism and Kantian agnos- ticism, into one; with the result, as in the case of the stereoscope, that the original views do not unite, but alternately dissolve into each other. It is asserted that we know directly the independently real object, but it turns out that what we see, for instance, is, strictly speaking, not the object itself, but a visual phenomenon which we project and substitute for it-a substitution which is practically justified. Thus we have what is not knowledge, but something else "just as good." This curious position is necessitated by the initial assumption that our perceptive experiences are not in the order which they reveal, but in a place repre- sented by that of the brain-states with which they are correlated-in other words, that experience is all cortical or "subcutaneous." If that were the case, of course things external to the body-or brain-could be known only substitutionally, and one would be forced, in spite of hinself, "back to Kant." The real problem of present-day philosophy is not how a subcutaneous mind can know that it has copied an extra-mental reality; that is a false problem which one should not try to solve, but to get rid of. The real problem before the philosopher is how to retain the ethical and reli- gious values for which theistic personal idealism stands, together with the common-sense of realism and the new insight made possible by the functional psychology which is fundamental to the instrumental logic of the most fruitful sort of pragmatism. DOUGLAS C. MACINTOSH YALE DIVINITY SCHOOL NEW HAVEN, CONN. In his recent work4 Professor Ladd has rendered a twofold service. He has compressed into a single volume the net results of his philosophic thinking during the past generation. Further, he has aimed to state his views in such a form that he may be understood by all who yield careful and thoughtful attention. Important as is the former, the latter service is far greater in its significance. This is a hopeful day for philosophy when it aims to make itself understood. It is fitting that so ardent a lover of wisdom should make it a matter of heart and conscience that his theme be presented not as an esoteric discipline but as a way to salvation for his age from that sensuousness and vul- 4 Knowledge, Life, and Reality.

He is concerned in the practical aspects of the situation because he sees in philosophy "an enormous accession of motive power for either evil or good results." It is inevitable that the author should refer to and quote from his previous publications. He does not claim to present particularly new results of his thinking. Yet, while he writes as one who aims to enforce the reasonableness of philosophizing, he is not unsensitive to the latest phases of his subject. Even the general reader, however, in these days of the popularity of the pragmatic philosophy will be somewhat dis- appointed to note the absence of any adequate discussion of the merits or demerits of pragmatism. Enough is said, it is true, to indicate the author's opposition to the movement. He denounces its "foolish fury toward the systems called by their older and more respectable names" and sees in it little semblance of an adequate solution of the problem of k'nowledge. He looks upon "pragmatism" as a much-abused word and denies that the test of truth is ever pragmatic. But these and other similar references to pragmatism are purely incidental and form no important part of the discussions. There are other currents in present-day thinking which are stamped with disapproval. No sympathy is shown for a psychology "without the metaphysical implicate of a soul." He believes that self-conscious- ness points to an agent. But by a soul he means something more than mind or intellect (p. 60) and regards "a stream of consciousness" as a most unfortunate and misleading figure of speech. Yet elsewhere he affirms that which he has denied and identifies soul and mind (pp. 227, 232). He declares that a soul is not a mere abstraction but refuses to see in it an entity analogous to material substance. So far as dis- coverable its essence lies in will, and is coincident with self. He refuses to entertain the notion of an unconscious or subconscious self because it is a contradiction in terms, every self being self-conscious. He holds that all such theories are either a cover for a mechanistic philosophy or for ignorance of the actual causes. Adherence to any one system of thought he repudiates. He seems to be especially sensitive to the defects of the Kantian philosophy. He denies the possibility of unmetaphysical science--"it is human to philosophize"-and admits the indebtedness of philosophy to science both in matter and method. He rejects mechanism and emphasizes the dynamic as against the static interpretation of things. The universe undergoes development; God alone is exempt from evolution. This exemption is made because God is held to be an absolute person, and a</page><page sequence="9">658 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY perfect ethical spirit. There is a certain immediacy in the test of reality that suggests a sympathy, which is admitted, with the faith-philosophy of Jacobi. But that sympathy is not complete; Professor Ladd, unlike Jacobi, knows but one criterion of truth. Reality, whether of subject or object, and the actual relation of both are regarded as indubitable experiences of sense-perception or of self-consciousness. If you raise, in the case of God, an ontological problem, the same problem attaches to all knowledge. "Being" is an assumption "based upon the faith of human reason in itself." Reject that assumption and nescience follows. As between realism and idealism our author is an idealist, but he would contest the exclusive acceptance of either. Even the great ideals have a realistic aspect and objective validity. In ethics, hedonism is rejected and utilitarian standards are cast aside. The feeling of obligation is ultimate though moral judgments are modified by environment, education, and reflection. Hence, the place of evolution in ethics is recognized; even the moral ideal undergoes evolution. The claims of the various virtues are to be adjusted by the one moral self, a self that determines rather than is determined by the moral ideal. All ethics, however, is fundamentally metaphysical; "the criteria, sanctions, and ideals of ethics must have their ultimate source and final warrant in the world-ground." In other terms, it is based upon the faith that the universe at heart is moral. Of course, this suggests the problem of evil. But faith, our author claims, is the final solution of this. He urges that the mere statement of the problem presupposes the supremacy of moral conditions. However much it may seem to some that the whole case for ethics has been assumed by this dependence upon faith, at least it is clear that Professor Ladd has no sympathy with those who seek to establish an ethics divorced from religious implications. Throughout the volume runs a defense of anthropomorphism, wherever found. Quite pertinently we are asked how otherwise, being men, could we know the universe save as the human mind grasps it. Even causality, fundamental in science, is both anthropomorphic and anthropopathic in its nature. Such a condition upon knowing cannot be escaped. Hence the God we know must be anthropomorphic. Monism, rather than dualism, is the outcome of philosophy; the uni- verse is grounded in a personal spirit. Religion is not science though it is reason that constructs the object of religious faith. Such a task is undertaken because reason has faith in its power to reach reality. But the God of philosophy, in whom are realized the ideals of humanity,</page><page sequence="10">IDEALISM, PRAGMATISM, AND THE NEW REALISM 659 seems in conflict with the God of popular thought. Nevertheless God is one, and we must guard ourselves against an attitude of opposition to modern science and philosophy. Upon the whole the work is stimulating and helpful. Some of the conclusions are not as definite as could be desired and, at times, we feel that the presentation of a controverted point has not been so fair and complete as we would like. Yet we must regard the limits imposed by a single volume upon free discussion and expression. We believe that at least the work will introduce, in an intelligible way, problems that carry their own impulse to more detailed consideration. WILLIAM THEODORE PAULLIN DENVER, COLO. In a recent books Dr. Buckham has entertainingly discussed various implications of the category of personality. His major attention, how- ever, is devoted to a consideration of the problem of the self and the nature of personalism. At the beginning the author is confronted with the old problem, Is there a workable line of demarkation between animals and men ? He decides that "the kind of capacity" constitutes a dividing line which "nothing can obliterate" (p. 30). Is the chasm then impassable? The answer is cautiously guarded: on the one hand, we may speak of a "germinal" or "potential" personality in domestic animals; but we may not speak of a "real personality" in this connection. "That this potential personality will ever become actual personality in the individual animal, in some other state of existence, no one can absolutely affirm or deny" (p. 29). And, on the other hand, it is difficult to find, in the lowest types of humanity, "any trace of that regality we call personality; yet who doubts that it is there, if only it can be awakened and developed" (p. 30) ? The author's primary interest, however, is in man. His thesis is that in every human being there is a conflict between the "empirical self" and the "True Self"; and that this conflict indicates an opportunity for the achievement of personality. "Whether the True Self . . . . or the empirical self . . . . is to win and rule, depends upon the Will" (p. 80). The empirical self belongs to the phenomenal order: it is "the product of an evolutionary series that goes back to the primordial germ" (p. '9I); it is "the self of moods, the plaything of circumstances and environment" (p. 72); its conscious activity is on the level of "under- s Personality and tke Christian Ideal.

It is simply unmoral" (p. 76). But when the will yields to the natural desires of the empirical self then "an act is committed which tends to deform the empirical self and constitute an anti-self" (p. 81). This anti-self is "no part of our original self-hood; it is a self that each of us constructs de novo" (p. 80). It becomes "an actual, enslaving, pseudo-self"; it "finds other spirits worse than itself and develops in their company" (p. 82); it joins that "kingdom of anti-selves" which is "the curse, and the only curse, of existence" (p. 83). And yet this anti-self, "as compared with the True Self," has no "genuine reality whatever" (p. 82). The "True Self" belongs to the noumenal order: it is not "an evolution from below" but "an impartation from above" (p. 191); it is "the self that transcends experience, that partakes of the universal" (p. 62); it is "not moved by physical conditions and states, except with its own consent" (p. io6); it introduces "order, harmony, end-serving" into this "unmoral, unregulated, purposeless world of sense" (p. 77); it is the "indestructible center of human salva- bility . . . . incapable of absolute perversion" (p. 82); it is "the Christ within" (p. 260); it is a co-operating member in "a society of persons, a Kingdom of God" (p. 131). The nature of personalism may be defined by contrasting individu- ality and personality. The former has to do with "the natural order": it is a "distinctively racial product" (p. 33); it is a "time product" (p. 37); it is associated with the natural, the phenomenal, facts, science (p. 249). The latter has to do with "the eternal order": it is "an intrinsic reality" (p. 33); it is "a supertemporal noumenon" (p. 37); its constituent elements are self-consciousness, unity, freedom, worth; it is in its very nature "universal" (p. 39); it is associated with the spiritual, the noumenal, verities, ontology (p. 249). It is impossible, however, to find "a mere human individual, uncompounded with per- sonality" (p. 34). In fact each human being "belongs to two orders of existence-the eternal order and the time order," i.e., man "belongs to the first and inhabits the second" (p. 188). "The person . . . . is in the individual, as the.nucleus is within the cell" (p. 38); he can "neither be born nor grow old nor die" (p. 37); he is a unique "end in himself," and may realize himself only in association with his fellows (p. 21); his empirical uniqueness consists in his specific type of indi- viduality, his spiritual uniqueness in his specific type of character (p. 28). Now, Jesus discerned this personality in every man; he counted everything as means to the achievement of the one end, personality;</page><page sequence="12">IDEALISM, PRAGMATISM, AND THE NEW REALISM 661 he established in his daily life the basic principle of conduct-man is to meet man on the level of ends, as person to person. In his own person there was a remarkable and exceptional union "of vitality and harmony, of enthusiasm and serenity." He was "aflame with zeal, and yet, like the burning bush, he was not consumed . . . . He was the radium of the moral world, constantly irradiating moral and spiritual force, yet with undiminished supply" (p. I95). He left "no ideal unfulfilled" (p. 205); he was "the perfect human person" (p. 194); he possessed "incomparable purity of moral insight and motive .... integrity of moral fiber .... wholeness and harmony of moral quality .... greatness and splendor of moral achievement." Such qualities make him "transcendent, archetypal, ideal" (p. 194). To him, however, we may not ascribe "absolute perfection," but only to "the Eternal Word" (p. 194). "He is the Goal . . . . of human aspiration and achievement" (p. 200); and by following Jesus Christ we may best achieve our moral self-development. Just a word may be said concerning three points. Has not the author virtually reinstated the Platonic dualism? "Impartation," just as certainly as "participation," presupposes two worlds. The dualism which is based upon a world of discourse is not to be confused with that which is based upon a Ptolemaic theory of the universe. In the entire discussion we find no explanation of "personality"-it is simply given, it is imparted to man by God. In the second place, the author employs the theory of imitation (p. 44) to account for the develop- ment of the consciousness of meaning. But imitation presupposes social consciousness; and becomes comprehensible only when there is a con- sciousness of other selves. On this theory of imitation, how explain the fact that the action of one form, in a contest for the protection of life, calls out in another form a diametrically opposite reaction? Again, during the first year, are not the parents more imitative than the child ? Finally, Dr. Buckham virtually forfeits the primary basis for any real explanation of that which he is most interested in-ideals. I quote: "Ideals, aspirations, convictions, valuations . . . . come not at all within the purview of science (except in pyschology, and there only on the physiological side) .... " (p. 250). Just what peculiar advan- tage has physiological psychology over social psychology in the study of ideals ? Are ideals merely imparted to the individual, or does the individual really construct his ideals ? In either event it would seem fitting, in the study of the inevitably accompanying psychical processes, to elevate psychology into major significance. C. A. EXLEY CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</page></plain_text>
