<plain_text><page sequence="1">Presidential Address: Searching for a Sense of Immediacy WILLIAM HOROSZ University of Oklahoma The purpose of this article is to expand the alternatives in our ap- proaches to knowledge in order to get us beyond the rather restricting alternative between subject matter and methodology which is the current preoccupation of empirical writers. Much of the hangup ap- pears to hinge on current beliefs about direct experience and the re- strictions it imposes on the knowledge process. These beliefs condition our views of given structures of meaning in experience and preclude other important considerations, more participatory views of given structures in experience. Stated briefly, the current alternative between the primacy of subject matter and the primacy of methodology, as possible avenues for the attainment of empirical knowledge, mis- construes the problem because structure, or the subject matter of experience, is regarded as model-free. Thus it falls beyond human projection, construction, and design and represents the bare Otherness of experience. But the Otherness of experience, defined apart from human participation in existence, is the unspeakable; for it has no human form and meaning. When given subject matter is interpreted as the image of Otherness in experience, as something which excludes methodological considerations, we have on our hands a methogenic artificial problem that creates false alternatives among the paths to knowledge. The way to multiply the paths to knowledge is to discard the model of direct experience which supports such a definition of subject matter in experience. We should regard it as a simplistic, premature solution to a complex problem and try to reformulate the meaning of direct experience in a manner which would support a more participatory model of structured meanings in experience. The structuralist's ap- proach to knowledge may simply be a way of registering our degree of participation in experience and of determining our involvement in existence by modes of elemental response rather than by mental con- structions. Once we consider the problem of direct experience and direct meaning as degrees of participation in existence, we are brought to the conclusion that the structures of given meanings in existence 129</page><page sequence="2">cannot be properly stated because the human orderer, in some form at least, has been denied the role of participation in primitive experience. Participation thus involves the notion of directive agency, before it involves the process of Otherness in experience. For the Otherness of experience needs human mediation in some form to have relevance to knowledge. What I am suggesting is that the process of forming meanings in experience is not free of human participation, and the latter is not free of model-making as it involves directive agency. We can design things with our heads and our hands, and also with our elemental modes of response to existence. This last point is not recog- nized by the structuralist seeking empirical knowledge. He attributes the responsibility for knowledge to the bare Otherness of experience which, as we have seen, is a myth when defined apart from human participation. Let us take a look at the model of existence that fashions our struc- turalist in naturalism. The structuralist assumes that direct experience is pre-rational, pre-purposive, unmediated, ineffable, basically myster- ious in its given Otherness. To say that Nature is responsible for knowledge at its source is tantamount to saying the same thing. Leťs call this model the pre-purposive model of immediate experience . This model assumes that model-creating relates significantly to method- ological considerations of knowledge, but not to the structures of ex- perience itself. Structural meanings, relations, qualities, and events stand in themselves or view us through the eyes of Otherness in experi- ence. They are ready-packaged for philosophical consumption. This is the requirement of the model of existence the naturalist is com- mitted to, and not the demand of existence qua existence. To believe otherwise is to assume an identification of our construct of existence with existence qua existence. We deny this claim of the identification of our models with existence itself because model-making does not yield lived experience. It merely produces another model of participa- tion. Even when it is claimed that one is not advocating a certain set model of existence but is emphasizing the very process of model- forming, model-creating, model-making, this is just another model of participation in experience. We have certain correlations with ex- perience but not an identification of our model with existence per se. We find the structuralist working with this disadvantage by insisting on the pre-purposive model of structured meaning in experience. It rests on an illicit identification of construct with experience qua ex- perience. The purposive model of immediacy and of given structured mean- ings in experience is more participatory in its claims. The distinctions 13°</page><page sequence="3">between discovery and invention, between structure (subject matter) and methodology, between direct and indirect experience are posterior to purposive being. The human orderer is, in some sense, either prior to or co-experiential with such distinctions. Moreover, the closeness and distance in experience (and this is what degrees of participation in experience are all about) cannot be stated apart from participation and directive agency. This leads us to say that direct experience is a model of experience. That experience itself is neither direct nor in- direct, presented nor inferred, immediate nor mediate. These represent our degree of participation in existence, either through the human capacity to immediatize (or existen tialize) or through our capacity to mediatize (or essentialize). Man's purposive nature, as the source of model-making in existence, is responsible for both relations, the relation of closeness (in elemental modes of response) and the relation of distance (in thought, abstraction, and essentialization). Once the goals and choices of man are related to his purposive nature, as direc- tive agency, we are coming close to the human orderer's contributions to immediate and mediate experience. When man can contribute directives to his becoming through his capacity for self-direction in existence we have the human orderer participating to varying degrees in existence. The point we wish to make is a simple one, namely, that assumed given patterns of meaning in experience are nothing more than the distilled meanings of human participation in existence. The given is thus partly designed by man through models and modes of participa- tion in being. The neglect of human participation in direct experience has restricted the paths to empirical knowledge. It has given the struc- turalist premature solutions to a cömplex problem. If structuralism is viewed as a different kind of construction and design of experience, from the kind of construction demanded by the methodologist, we are not losing direct experience. We are, rather, regaining it in more human form. The bareness of Otherness in experience helps no one, for it is mute with respect to knowledge. If it possesses a revealing capacity, this capacity is mediated by human purpose. If we list, for the sake of contrast, the post-purposive model of ex- istence , which construes immediacy in terms of supernatural and supra- rational directives, we have another model of direct experience. In this perspective we stand on different evidential grounds. For the natural is the indirect. The supra-natural experience is the directly funneled experience. We mention this model only in passing. It gives us some idea of the historic reaction of the pre-purposive model. But it is time now to rethink the problem of immediacy in a non-reactive *3*</page><page sequence="4">setting. The war between naturalism and anti-naturalism is largely over. At least, it is time now to stop identifying our models of experi- ence with experience itself to make our case for direct experience and to direct structures of meaning, in terms of the bare Otherness of experience. This may simply be the demand of the model of existence which commands our attention, and not the demand of given struc- tures of meaning discovered by us in existence. This is the path to procedural ultimates. The conclusion we are about to reach is that direct experience is not one thing. It comes in at least three brands, and these brand names control the ingredients that go into the formula of immediate experience. If direct experience comes in three models, and it is the supporting philosophy of direct given structures of meaning found by the structuralist in experience, what are we to say of the structuralist's position and his role in knowledge-getting? Is it true that the subject matter of experience also comes in at least three brands, depending on whether we view experience from above , from below , or from our- selves in acts of participation? Take the material substance as a deter- minate body of static things in highly structured relations, as static structures, and the reader has one meaning of structure and subject matter. Take the issue of functional and more rynamic structures and the reader will think of subject matter as consisting of ever recur- ring patterns, events, qualities, unities, and relations. These are proces- sive structures. But if he takes cognizance of existential structures dis- closed to the thinker in phenomena or essential structures, the reader is confronted with another kind of given subject matter. The variety of claims among the structuralists, achieved both by subjective and objective routes, should be warning enough that human design is im- printed upon these allegedly given structures of meaning in experi- ence. The epistemic monism of James, Husserl, and Russell would easily yield the pre-purposive model of immediacy and structure. Theological writers could easily be marshalled to state the case for post-purposive justification of immediacy and structure, just as we are trying to state the case for structure and immediacy in terms of the notion of models by participation. If immediacy can be seen to come at least in three brands, research could assure us of similar models regarding the given structured meanings in experience. The two are inextricably bound to a similar fate. American naturalism, with its emphasis on the "return to experi- ence," has given us qualities in experience which "stand in them- selves." Stated in terms of "pure experience," in terms of "social be- haviorism," or in terms of "all-inclusive situations," we have on our 132</page><page sequence="5">hands, dynamic structures, as over against static structures, but struc- tures, nonetheless. To the extent that some read these in terms of methodology, they admit human design as part of these structured meanings. To the extent that these are viewed as given non-participa- tory meanings of structured experiences, they are appraised structural- ly. We have both varieties in American naturalism, and Sterling P. Lamprecht reminds us that the problem has been with us since the days of John Locke, some 250 years ago. In the period between 1671 and 1690, Locke struggled with the same issue as he moved from the study of things themselves (structures, subject matter) to more psy- chological interpretations of given meanings. Similar problems face existentialism, phenomenology, and the phenomenology of existence, along subjective and intersubjective lines. Sterling Lamprechťs position, which attempts a metaphysics of naturalism, cannot get beyond the narrow alternative of methodology and structuralism. Apparently, he is trying to be fair to both his teach- ers, Dewey and Woodbridge. He states: If empiricism is to develop soundly, if its predilection for method- ology is not to lead to merely effete dialectics, it must be more ready to see each of its methodological devices and distinctions as disclosures of the nature of that subject-matter which makes the methodology workable. And this means that empiricism should be- come frankly an appeal to the authority which subject-matter may exercise over thinking and a respect for the theoretical knowledge of that subject-matter which experimental methodology may really gain.1 The apparent reconciliation betwen method and structure is weighted in the direction of structuralism in Lamprechťs position. The solu- tion is practical, not theoretical. It would be nice if they worked to- gether, but they do not. Thelma Z. Lavine's position is more on the ascendency in American naturalism. It states: "To postulate the con- tinuity of analysis is to demand, if one is a naturalist, that the investi- gation into all problems in all subject-matters employ the methods of the special sciences or methods which may be incorporated by the special sciences .... 'Continuity' of analysis can thus mean only that all analysis must be scientific analysis."2 The upshot of Lavine's comment is that "continuity in existence" can be read as "continuity of analysis," that it is merely a useful metaphor for methodological constructionism. There is no given continuity of meaning in the given 1 Lamprecht, The Metaphysics of Naturalism (New York: Appleton-Century- Crofts, 1967), pp. 58-59. 2 Lavine, "Naturalism and the Sociological Analysis of Knowledge," Naturalism and the Human Spirity ed. Y. H. Krikorian (New York: Columbia University Press, 1945), pp. 184-85. *33</page><page sequence="6">structures of experience. Structuralism is thus reduced to methodology in empirical studies of experience. This apparent impasse between structuralists and methodologists needs clarification by extending the framework in which given mean- ings in experience are related to participation and directive agency. Then, structuralism can be read as a different form of methodology, a methodology by participation rather than by reflection and con- struction. Our purposive model of direct experience demands this more participatory theory of structured meanings in immediate experi- ence. The pre- and post-purposive models of immediacy have brought us to this impasse in empirical knowledge. We should at least re- examine their claims and justification once more. It may be a metho- genic artificial problem. If it is, it simply means the necessity of reconstructing our model of existence to make better correlations with immediacy and given structures of meaning. Whether we move "be- yond construction to structure" (Lamprecht), or "beyond structure to construction," (Lavine) is, after all, an issue that is co-experiential with the human orderer as he participates in existence. We cannot be content with the Jamesian solution that immediacy mediatizes and mediation immediatizes. This is to confound our models of exist- ence, which control the meaning of existence. We can make sense out of knowledge that is structure-oriented, knowledge that is method- oriented, knowledge that is process-oriented, essence-oriented, exist- ence-oriented, or whatnot, but only through the mediation of our purposive nature. Once we exclude the human orderer from primitive experience, all we can do is make claims to procedural or structural ultimates, or claim the existential alternative of "instant being." This is tantamount to denying legitimate paths to knowledge. However, once we postulate the distinction between subject matter and method as the distinction between models of participation (through elemental levels of response for which man's purposive nature is the gathering focus) and models of reflection (similarly related to human purpose and its capacity for essentialization), the issue liberates us to use a plurality of methods in philosophy to gather knowledge from experi- ence. There are, however, no instructions of experience to the exclu- sion of the human orderer and his participation in experience. Before knowledge is method- or structure-oriented it is model-oriented. This increases the alternative paths to knowledge from two to three. But once we allow for the third possibility which encourages a plurality of methods of knowing, the possibilities are many. All that we require is that whatever path to knowledge we take be mediated by our pur- posive nature as the source of model-making. *34</page><page sequence="7">of analysis," that it is merely a useful metaphor for methodological constructionism. There is no given continuity of meaning in the given Perhaps the reader has sensed that I have been using human pur- pose, as the equivalent for the human orderer, in an untraditional manner, other than its traditional meaning of intentionality and goal- direction. That is true. The underlying assumption of this paper is that purpose is relevant to existence ontologically. This means that man is self-directing in existence, and this is a precondition to purpose as goal-direction and intentionality. We have developed this levels- theory of purposiveness in four stages elsewhere as the ontological, phenomenal, analytic, and the artifactual meanings of purpose. The last three stages postulate purpose as some form of end, or goal-direc- tion. The ontological level of purpose as self-direction remains the precondition of goal-direction and intentionality. The human orderer may, then, be defined as the subject-object dialogue mediated by his purposive nature. Much of this has to be left assumptive and specula- tive in this short article, but the theory is explicated in The Promise and Peril of Human Purpose .3 Suffice it to say that if purpose has an ontological relevance to existence, then it should have some relevance to immediacy and to structured meanings in knowledge-getting. If man is the source of model-making in existence, as the human orderer capable of self-direction in existence, our notions of immediacy and given structure should be re-examined. The fact that all our knowledge may be model-oriented (as epistemology relates to ontology) should be considered as a prior issue to the problem of the method-structure disctinction. The conflict between method and structure may be an ill-advised problem, as we seem to think. We do not solve the conflict between construction (method) and structure by giving them both a "natural basis" because one, then, goes "beyond construction to structure," and leaves the methodolo- gists unhappy. The distinction between the "order of human develop- ment" (construction) and the "order of nature" (structure) cannot be solved apart from the participation of the "human orderer" in both. There is prior purposiveness that needs to be accounted for in such a distinction. There is thus a middle position between the bare Other- ness of experience and experience as a function of human desire and purpose. That middle position is that the human orderer as a partici- pant in existence both mediates the notion of Otherness and has re- spect for existence by participation in experience. This increases the 3 William Horosz, The Promise and Peril of Human Purpose (St. Louis: War- ren Green, Inc., 1970) .

Just what are the consequences of this third option for knowledge? i ) If a man is a subject-object dialogue mediated by his purposive nature, the position provides a theory that allows for the legitimacy of subjectivistic and objectivistic approaches to knowledge. We do not solve the problem practically by saying, for example, that in prac- tice we need scientific method and the human factor, too. We need a theory of reconciliation if this is the case. When the structuralist's view is seen as a participation process of forming experience, we can see our way to reconciling objectivism with subjectivism. Both princi- ples require the mediating capacity of ontological self-direction to be operative in existence. 2) It will encourage methodological pluralism in the investigation of experience. This is to be desired to procedural or structural ulti- mates, for the latter alternative breeds dogmatism in philosophy. 3) It provides new grounds for the justification of experience as an alternative to dogmatism in philosophical investigations of experience. 4) It could bring rapprochment to naturalism and the phenomen- ology of Existence, but not on the grounds of common universal im- mediacy (which is a fiction) but, instead, on the grounds of the legiti- macy of both methods of approach made possible by the triadic rela- tionship of ontological interaction which is at the base of our theory of purpose and its relevance to existence. 5) It includes the human orderer in primitive experience once again without falsifying experience by covert forms of mediation and revelation. Ontologies which remove the human orderer from primi- tive experience do so at their own peril, for they are forced to consider artificial orderings within immediate experience (defined initially as unmediated experience). 6) It gives man's affective life a gathering focus in the human orderer. Perhaps man's purposive nature can take over the functions of reason in classical thought as the gathering focus of elemental modes of response to existence. 7) The greatest benefit which I envision for the position is, I think, the fact that it allows us to relate knowledge to models of existence. In this relationship, knowledge will have a base in participation. Rea- son will be related to purpose and purpose to the emotions. When we postulate purpose on the ontological level and thereby make it a more integral part of experience there will be less of a ten- 136</page><page sequence="9">dency in philosophy to restructure man and give his powers over to some other directive agency: to Nature, Being, Life, or God, or what- not. When the human orderer plays a more participating role in his positionality in the universe, it will be unlikely that such restructuring of human existence will be taken as lightly as it is today. This is appli- cable both to man's place in the system of Nature and in the system of Being. His situation of dependence will turn more into situations of possibility and authenticity. Let me dwell for a moment on the main difference between the purposive model of existence and the pre- and post-purposive versions of immediate experience. These latter designs for living are goal- directed designs. They are either goalward bent to something below experience or goalward bent to something above existence. To ac- complish their destiny and to guarantee this goal-direction, these models identify their models of existence with existence qua existence. The purposive model of existence, on the other hand, refrains from such a process of identification of construct with existence. It allows for ontological self-direction prior to goal-direction and insists on models of participation and their correlation with experience. The correlation theory of immediacy is superior to the other constructs because it is a participatory theory of immediacy and because it regis- ters the difference between constructs of our own making and design and existence qua existence. Even when man participates in existence through elemental responses, through moods and actions, this does not escape model-making through participation. No one is exempt from the human orderer, from the directives of his purposive nature in participatory situations. To take man's affective life, or his life of feeling, out of the realm of the human orderer, simply gives us the mindless and purposeless encounters that existentialists talk about. No wonder life is angst-ridden and despairing for the existentialist. Primitive experience consists in rudderless encounters and involve- ments. This is required by the pre-purposive model of existence which identifies construct with existence. The purposive model, on the other hand, enables man to be self-directing in these engagements and en- counters in existence. Our model has no incentive to overcome the split between construct and immediate experience, of going beyond model-making. It is content with the participation that such model- creating allows in the realm of experience. In defense of existentialism and its identification of construct with existence one authority writes: How shall form (model, construct, "approach") and man come back together in a new way? It must be a new way, since there can 137</page><page sequence="10">no longer be a genuine restoration of some one model, form, meta- physics, value system, social role, or artistic style. "New Way" does not mean the old imposition of some one model, but a method of using many models, a method of using this human modeling power rather than staying within some one model for a century or two. As I see it, the process of forming must itself be the new type of "approach." What has happened occasionally and some centuries apart must now become routine for us. It is not this or that model, but the process of model-creating itself.4 But do we have lived experience when we leave behind the set model and pay attention only to the process of model-creating, model- forming? Our reply is that this, too, is existential construction-making by participation. Why should our participatory life be excluded from the sphere of the human orderer and placed on a more primitive level of experience than the directives of man's purposive nature? Such an identification between model-making and concrete living was also practiced by the naturalists when they shifted in ethics from set values to the process of valuation itself (making it more objective and more event-like in character). Did they escape the question of standards? Or, did they simply work in hidden forms of standard-making to give direction to the process of valuation? The process of valuation, like the process of existentialization, however, is not exempt from model- making, and the latter cannot be identified with lived experience. The problem is that ready-packaged experience is not lived experience. In fact, if it is not packaged by the human orderer, it is not lived experi- ence. The only lived experience the purposive model has respect for is my lived experience and yours, respectively. There is no common, uni- versal process of lived experience walking down the road, either the road of existential encounter or the road of naturalistic interactions and transactions. The new way, in fact, turns out to be a rather old way, the way of smuggling directionality into allegedly unmediated immediate experi- ence, of using the pre-purposive model of existence to establish the mean and direction of human life. The only way that the process of model-making can produce lived experience is through an illicit identifi- cation of our model of existence with existence qua existence. Human- modeling power, devoid of the directives of man's purposive nature in primitive experience, is, in fact, an abstraction from lived experience. Philosophies of personal encounter and interaction are merely practicing model-making by participation, rather than model-making by reflec- 4 Martin Heidegger, W hat is a Thing? trans. W. B. Bartin, Jr. and Vera Deutsch (Chicago: H. Regnery Co., 1968), p. 291. 138</page><page sequence="11">tion. They never pass beyond the process of model-making, and of correlation with experience. When they identify construct with exist- ence, they give us new abstractions from lived experience that deifies the process of model-creating into lived experience. Such trips that go beyond model-making, beyond the subject-object split, beyond existen- tial particulars to existential universais, are imaginary trips, as far re- moved from existence qua existence as the experience of anyone else. No one has an inside lead on life, or has reality by the tail. For we are all involved in the process of participation, in the midst of which we make our correlations between the participating human orderer and experience. If constructs by creative participation are aspects of the process of model-making, and a part of man's search for models of human na- ture, we can only regard them as close-ups of experience. There is no point in hiding the purposive camera within immediacy, because it takes pictures there, too. Human purpose is needed for close-ups of experience just as it is needed for distant shots. Covert forms of medi- ations and directives in the field of immediacy, in unmediated areas of experience, is the most common misapprehension of philosophers today. Instead of excluding the human orderer from primitive experi- ence, and substituting artificial directives for living, we should recog- nize its capacity for ontological self-direction and its role of immedi- atizing and existentializing experience. Through such participation we can have honest correlations with experience and reality. The pre- and post-purposive models of immediacy have given us a heritage of scepticism, in spite of its identification of construct with existence. If we make less pretentious claims to having reality, we can perhaps find greater satisfaction in merely participating in it. After all, how primary is primary experience? Our reply is, that it is as primary and as direct as man's purposive being can make it through modes of elemental response to experience, in modes of creative participation. The implication of this correlation theory, which postulates a view of immediacy in terms of forms of participation in existence, is that anthropomorphism is as unavoidable in experience as it is in thought. We cannot avoid the problem of anthropomorphism in man's relation to experience because we have to state our case for immediacy in terms of participation of one sort or another. In fact, the term would make more sense if we were to use it in the plural. For it appears that in averting one kind of anthropomorphism we simply fall prey to another. Even the notion of bare Otherness in experience, from our perspec- tive, is a form of anthropomorphism when its meaning is mediated by human participation. The alleged neutrality of science in its objective *39</page><page sequence="12">pursuit of truth is another example of it. While science concentrates on pre-subjective experience, this objective experience is not pre-pur- posive. Objectivity is a deliberate search in which ontological self- direction is asserted in the very process of denying purposiveness. Pur- pose is asserted in this alienating experience by its very denial. It is only the pre-purposive model of immediacy which holds that science can overcome anthropomorphism in searching for pure facts. And it may simply be the requirement of the model itself, and just another manifestation of anthropomorphism. One may even call it experi- mental anthropomorphism. Experience itself is neither experimental nor non-experimental. Anthropomorphisms manifest themselves both in our schemes of participation and in our efforts at constructions in experience. They are needed when we existentialize experience or es- sen tialize existence. But although we cannot discard anthropomorphism, we can manage it through man's purposive being by seeking for more honest corre- lations with experience, if we know when to be subjective and when to be objective in our purposive nature. If a participatory theory of immediacy requires some anthropomorphic outlook, so much the better for it. The alternative to this position is to solve life's problems by first excluding the human orderer from primitive experience and, then, substituting other directive agencies in its place, like dialectical systems or mystic designs. In searching for models of human nature, we cannot afford the latter alternative. The greatest myth of the twen- tieth century is that we can get closer to experience if we deny the role of the human orderer in existence, if we excise him from primitive experience. This myth rests on certain misconceptions of immediate experience. After all, searching for a sense of immediacy is, first, man's search through participation, before it is something else. The doctrine of the primacy of existence in the phenomenology of existence, and the doctrine of pure experience in radical empiricism, both practice this myth. Our problem is to discover how to get off this bandwagon of the- orizing and to provide a more meaningful notion of immediacy to open up new paths to knowledge. We cannot "call it as it is," because "as it is" is detemined by our participation in existence. The search for a sense of immediacy is a search by participation. Unless we take respon- sibility in our purposive nature for that search and close-up of experi- ence, we are more interested in restructuring man than in understand- ing him. The existential model of participating in immediate experience runs along subjective and intersubjective lines. Such experiences may be pre-objective because they assume the ontological priority of the 140</page><page sequence="13">subject self to the principle of objectification. But they are not pre- purposive. The naturalistic model of participation in immediate ex- perience is along objective lines. Such experiences are pre-subjective because they assume the ontological priority of the object self to the principle of self-subjectification. But they are not pre-purposive. Both these pre-purposive models of experience fall short of an adequate theory of human participation because they exclude the human orderer from primitive experience. When human purpose is viewed as some- thing more than as a function of subjectivity, or the function of the mind, or the function of objective interactions, then, as a part of being, it becomes an integral part of any definition of human partici- pation. These schools of thought are merely subdivisions of the pre- purposive model, following subjective and objective routes in their philosophical investigations of experience. Because neither school defines the human orderer ontologically, the human orderer has an inadequate, abstracted form of human participation. In summarizing the theme of this address, let me say that my inten- tion here has been to give an extended framework in which we can cope readily with the distinction between structure and method in the attainment of knowledge. This extended framework hinges on the human orderer as part of the problem of structure and method. To say that man's designs affect merely external projection in consider- ing structured meanings in experience is to miss the point. This is merely the requirement of the pre-purposive model of immediacy. Inner designs and inner projections are just as much a matter of partici- pation as external projections. To say that projection is a projection of something (the upon-which) is an attempt on the part of some writers to state the case for bare Otherness in experience that is model-free. It is the demand of the pre-purposive model that states this requirement. Otherness is dumb and mute. It says nothing unless we speak for it through the experience of participation in existence. Much of what goes on in current philosophy and religion is concerned with these competing models of immediate experience which contend for an understanding of existence. The other part of the problem is to continue to make important correlations with existence to experience lived experience in a participatory manner. That can be done only if the human orderer is not excluded from primitive experience, from the give and take of life. 141</page></plain_text>
