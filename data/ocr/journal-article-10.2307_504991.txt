It is therefore assumed that, throughout this period, Minoans relied primarily on por- table means to provide themselves with fire for warmth and for cooking. There is, however, a fair amount of ev- idence that, at least in MM I-II, fixed hearths were also in use. Some have been known for a long time as a feature primarily characteristic of houses at Mallia; others have not really been recognized for what they are, since they are considered cultic installations. The examination of several types of Middle Minoan hearths indicates that they all form an interconnected and coherent group of fixtures which enjoyed a relatively brief fashion in Crete, but were nevertheless consistently used in private houses, larger complexes and palaces in MM I-II. The reconsideration of some rooms in build- ings at Mallia and in the early palace at Phaistos, inter- preted as shrines because of the presence of such hearths, suggests that these areas were used for domestic rather than for cultic purposes. This conclusion, while avoiding the inconsistencies inherent in the religious interpreta- tion of these rooms, accounts for their location, the pres- ence of hearths and the nature of the associated features and objects found in them. The identification of these compartments as kitchen or kitchen-dining areas helps to bridge a puzzling gap in our knowledge of the planning and organization of im- portant daily activities in the larger Minoan establish- ments, a gap that has only recently begun to be filled with evidence from the period of the second palaces. A fixed hearth represents the permanent allocation of a certain amount of space for a fire. The use of such fixtures is obviously manifold, for hearths can serve as the focus of one or several kinds of activities which may be domestic, industrial or even ceremonial and religious. In archaeological contexts the specific func- tion or functions of a hearth can be determined pri- marily through interpretation of its context, i.e., the nature of the area where it is found, its specific loca- tion within this area and the features and objects asso- ciated with it. In addition, although as a permanent fixture it has no independent existence, a hearth can be shaped into distinct forms and decorated; these fac- tors, as well as size, can have a bearing on the inter- pretation-of function. Fixed hearths are a well attested feature of domes- tic architecture in the Aegean in all phases of the Neo- * Some of the material included here was discussed in my doc- toral dissertation, "Minoan Libation Tables," (Bryn Mawr Col- lege 1981).

Thus, little is known in this respect about the Cyclades, where few settle- ments have been explored, while in the southern parts of the mainland the record is fuller. Aegean hearths vary a great deal even within a cer- tain area or a certain period. The space they occupy may be marked only by a concentration of ashes and burnt material, or more clearly defined by a border of stones.' Frequently, hearths appear as slightly raised areas which are coated with plaster or clay usually spread over a substructure of pebbles, stones or sherds. These areas may be circular, rectangular or horseshoe-shaped. Roughly shaped fixtures of this type with a clay lining occur in many contexts,2 but carefully made hearths in specific shapes which often bear decoration are a feature of certain areas in the southern part of the mainland and in the Cyclades in two periods-Early Bronze II and Mycenaean. Although Aegean hearths have not been the subject of a specific study, they are regularly mentioned in general treatments and in more specialized studies of the area in the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. In par- ticular, the Early Bronze II examples have been sin- gled out because of their decoration,3 while the hearths of the Mycenaean megara have figured in dis- cussions of palace architecture and Mycenaean reli- gion.4 In contrast, fixed hearths in Minoan Crete have received little attention. Sir Arthur Evans be- lieved that in Crete fixed hearths went out of use after the Neolithic period when they were superseded by the ubiquitous braziers and tripod hearths character- istic of the Minoan periods.5 Despite modifications imposed by subsequent discoveries, his conclusions have had a pervasive influence on later scholarship. The more extensive exploration of the Neolithic settlement at Knossos and the deeper soundings below the Minoan levels at Phaistos have produced many examples of Neolithic hearths, ovens and "cooking holes."'6 Such features are also well represented at Myrtos in EM II.7 Moreover, as early as 1932, De- margne had collected several examples of clay and plaster fixtures from Mallia and Knossos, dated to MM I, which could be identified as hearths.8 Al- though his identification was accepted,9 it had little impact and the feeling still persists that in the time of the greatest development of Minoan civilization, from MM Ib through LM I, portable containers of fire were the principal means used in Crete for heating and cooking purposes.1o Yet quite early in the archaeological exploration of the island Hazzidakis had remarked that the diversity of Minoan cooking equipment implied the existence of a sophisticated cuisine for which some sort of per- manent installations would seem necessary."11 Cer- tainly the typical Minoan tripod cooking pot (which can now be documented as early as EM 112) WaS well adapted for use over a brazier. Portable ovens and hearths designed for cooking are also known.13 Such equipment would perhaps be adequate in a private house, but it could hardly meet the needs of larger es- tablishments, which undoubtedly existed in Minoan Crete, let alone those of a palatial complex. A few ex- amples of fixed hearths, fireplaces or ovens have in- deed been found in Neopalatial houses. The discovery of a large kitchen equipped with a hearth at Zakro has confirmed the existence of such installations in the palaces of that period,14 but evidence for cooking 1 D.R.

In contrast, although the period of the early palaces is far less well known architecturally, the evidence for the use of such fix- tures at that time is much more extensive. There are two reasons why hearths in the period of the early palaces have generated little interest. Most of the Middle Minoan hearths which have been iden- tified were found in houses at Mallia in contexts that, for a long time, were dated to MM I. Even though this period at Mallia is now more precisely correlated with MM I and MM II in central and southern Crete, the hearths have seldom been discussed in pub- lications other than those on Mallia,15 perhaps giving the impression that they were primarily prepalatial features which had lingered on at this site and were, in any case, confined to private houses.'16 In addition, two groups of relevant material from Middle Minoan levels at Phaistos have been ignored. The first-- braziers sometimes found in fixed positions-were until recently called portable offering tables or stands; the second-a series of rectangular fixtures first found at Phaistos-is still considered as a related type of cul- tic equipment. When all this material is considered together and placed in its proper context, certain generally ac- cepted ideas must be revised. Although there can be no doubt that portable containers of fire were widely used in houses and palaces in MM I-II, fixed hearths were in use concurrently with them. More signifi- cantly, these fixtures allow identification of several areas in at least one large complex and in an impor- tant palatial center as examples of the elusive Minoan kitchen. TYPES OF MIDDLE MINOAN HEARTHS AND THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN BACKGROUND The Middle Minoan fixed hearths discussed by Demargne in 1932 were found at Mallia and Knos- sos.17 Others were discovered soon after in the Middle Minoan houses excavated south of the palace at Mal- lia.18 All these fixtures were constructed of clay or stucco in disk-shape with a cavity in the center. They generally measured 0.65-0.85 m. across, while their cavities were often 0.14-0.16 in diameter."19 Occasion- ally a slightly raised border defined their perimeter more clearly (pl. 25, fig. 1).20 The examples made of clay were fixed in the floor in a special bedding de- scribed, in one case, as consisting of hardened clay, coarse sherds and small stones.21 The fact that they were fragile and poorly baked22 indicates that they had been hardened gradually by fire. The plastered hearths appear as slightly depressed circular areas in floors of the same material (ills. 1-2). In a Middle Minoan house at Knossos the floor as well as the hearth had been painted red.23 In practically all cases the upper surface of these fixtures showed traces of burning, so their identification as hearths cannot be doubted. The early palace at Phaistos has not revealed any examples of this type of fixture, but the site has pro- duced great numbers of terracotta lamps and braziers. Characteristic is a type of tall brazier with a bowl- shaped receptacle surrounded by a wide rim. The dia- meter of this utensil ranges from 0.204 to 0.383 m. Its . - :r .- --. . .

(After Demargne 1932, fig. 2) upper surface and sides were covered with a red slip and well burnished. The rim was often decorated with impressed designs (pl. 25, fig. 3). The absence of wick cuttings and the details of the attachments and base differentiate these objects from the tall terracotta lamps finished in a similar manner.24 The upper part of several of these braziers (and of one lamp) has been found embedded in the floor of houses around the palace and in the palace itself.25 The blackened condition of the utensils and, in one case, of the surrounding floor, as well as the frequent association of domestic pottery, querns and whet- stones, indicates that these objects served as fixed sources of heat and light, i.e., as hearths. The form of the upper surface of the braziers is indeed essentially the same as that of the permanent circular hearths from Mallia and Knossos. Another series of fixtures of clay used at Phaistos, in the Mesara and at Mallia in this period can also be identified as belonging to a type of fixed hearth. They are rectangular, with a cavity similar to that of the circular type. Several fragments-plain, covered with black paint or bearing impressed or painted decora- tion-come from Phaistos (pl. 26, figs. 9-11).26 A painted fragment is known from Koumasa.27 Six ex- amples have been discovered fixed in position-three at Phaistos, two at Mallia and one at Zakro. Another example from Mallia should probably be also added to this list. The best known example of these rectangular hearths is HM 1621 from room VIII at Phaistos (pl. 26, fig. 6; ill. 3).28 It is a rectangle of coarse clay that measures 0.55 x 0.45 m. and has a raised border. A cavity 0.16 m. in diameter is set closer to one of the short sides. The visible parts of the hearth were smoothed, covered with a reddish-brown slip and well burnished. The raised border is decorated with im- pressed S-spirals and figures of bovids. The object was found set in a special bedding of sand and peb- bles. The excavator noted its softened and friable con- dition, as well as the roughness of the underside,29 both indications that the hearth had been constructed on the spot and fired gradually. The fairly extensive restoration that the object received after its removal has smoothed over the rough underside, but has not entirely obliterated the traces of burning on its upper surfaces which were not mentioned in the original publication and have gone virtually unnoticed.30 Ill. 3. Longitudinal section of hearth from room VIII at Phaistos. (After FestUs 1, fig. 107) The same area of the palace at Phaistos contained another hearth located in the space immediately north of room VIII (pl. 27, fig. 14).31 It was in the shape of a large rectangle formed by the levelling of the bedrock which in this area sloped up northward to a consid- erable height above the level of the floor in the adja- cent rooms. The hearth had been coated with clay painted red and had a circular cavity similar to that of HM 1621. It contained fragments of vases and other objects and burnt animal bones mixed with pebbles, ashes and charcoal. The third hearth from Phaistos, F 6724 (pl. 26, fig. 7), was located in an area close to the central court of the palace. It is similar to HM 1621 in size and finish but undecorated.32 Its cavity is funnel-shaped with a distinctly convex rim. Its surface is also blackened by fire. 24 L.

They are both simple rectangles of clay with an off-center cavity. One was found in a complex of three small rooms excavated west of the palace, near the Stratigraphic Museum (pl. 27, fig. 12)33; the other was located in room 1.12 of Building A in Quartier Mu.34 The former was de- scribed as having been burnt so thoroughly that the surface below it was transformed into a sort of brick. No details have been published on the hearth from Quartier Mu, but there is no doubt that it belongs to the same series of objects. It is probable that another, similar hearth was found in situ in Quartier Theta, marking by its position the main floor of a Middle Minoan house which had been raised above ground level. The rest of the floor had collapsed.35 Finally, a carefully made hearth of rectangular shape with a raised border and a stone vessel inserted in its central cavity was found at Zakro in 1981,36 but its exact lo- cation, associations and date are at present unknown. The interrelationships of these three types of instal- lations in terms of manufacture, shape, finish and even method of decoration are obvious and need not be elaborated. Nor is there a dearth of parallels for them outside Crete. Fixed hearths of plaster or clay spread on a bedding of stones and sherds, in rectangular, cir- cular or horseshoe-shape, occur not only in the Ae- gean, but also in many areas around the eastern Med- iterranean in various periods. Even very early exam- ples of clay, such as those discovered in Neolithic lev- els at Dikili Tash in Thrace (pl. 27, fig. 13), look re- markably similar to the simpler rectangular hearths from Minoan Crete down to their off-center cavi- ties.37 Circular plastered hearths with a cavity, exact- ly like those found at Mallia, have been excavated in houses at Tell Chuera in northern Syria, in levels 4 and 5 dated to the first half of the third millennium B.C. (pl. 25, fig. 2).38 Similar fixtures of clay have been found at Tell Judeideh in the 'Amuq in phase H, which is generally equated with EB III in Pales- tine, the period of the intrusive Khirbet Kerak ware (ill. 4).39 PLAN / / 0 M I'~~ ii I i Ill. 4. Circular hearth from Tell Judeideh, Syria. (After OIP 61, fig. 260) The connections of the Minoan hearths with simi- lar fixtures in other areas have not passed unnoticed. In his study of the circular examples from Mallia and Knossos, Demargne listed all the parallels known from the Greek mainland at the time.40 More recently attention has been drawn to the relationship of HM 1621 from room VIII at Phaistos to the decorated Helladic and Cycladic hearths of the Early Bronze Age.41 The latter are particularly characteristic of EH/EC II, and were usually of circular or keyhole shape. Fragments of rectangular examples, however, furnished with a cavity and bearing impressed deco- ration on their border, appear in Poliochni Blue.42 These hearths have seldom been found in situ,43 but are well known on the Mainland from fragments found in several sites in the northwestern Pelopon- nesos, Attica and Boiotia. Many of the decorated ex- amples bear designs impressed with cylinder seals; 33 Poursat 1966, 531, fig. 18. Dimensions: 0.92 x 0.66-0.74 m. Diameter of cavity: 0.14 m.

The hearth is about 1.20 x 0.55 m. and appears to have a raised border on three sides. 35 The hearth measured 1.10 x 0.60 m. and was of coarse clay so friable that it could not be preserved. Its central part looks broken in the published photograph; the object was described as "l~g?re- ment ddfonc&amp;e en son centre" (Maisons 4, 19, pl. 7.2). 36 Ergon 1982, 66, fig. 108. 37 BCH 92 (1968) 1064, fig. 6bis. 38 A.

At Kea many bore only Kerbschnitt.47 At Lerna incised patterns, applied strips of clay and thin black paint were used.48 Un- decorated hearths are also well attested at both sites. Most of these objects can be shown to have been manufactured on the spot.49 Some fragments from Kea have handles and have, therefore, been conjec- tured to belong to smaller utensils that could be moved.5s This need not always be the case. A com- pletely preserved, unpublished example of an undeco- rated hearth, over one meter long, which is on display in the Aghios Nikolaos Museum in eastern Crete, has two small, obviously non-functional handles. This hearth is closer to a figure-eight than to a keyhole shape, but is clearly related to the Cycladic series. Some of these objects, however, were certainly smaller and not made on the spot, and may have ful- filled a role similar to that of the Phaistos braziers, a fact indicated by some of the so-called "hat vases" from the Cyclades. These objects are not very well known.5' A relatively large group of them has been recently found in the area of the cemetery of Aghioi Anargyroi on Naxos.52 Their shape is essentially that of a deep bowl with a disproportionately wide rim decorated with variants of the same impressed design (pl. 25, fig. 4). In some versions the bottom of the re- ceptacle is rounded; in others, it is flattened and often bears mat impressions. The diameter, in both vari- ants, ranges from 0.20 to 0.38 m., while that of the cavity fluctuates between 0.065 to 0.125 m. Hat vases with rounded bottoms obviously could not stand by themselves, while even those provided with a base lack stability because of their proportions. The suggestion that they are braziers,53 or rather hearths that could sometimes be moved, seems reasonable, since all that would be needed for their support and installation was a hole scooped in the floor to accommodate the receptacle. Their formal relationship to Minoan cir- cular hearths and the tall braziers of Phaistos is close. On the Greek mainland in EH II impressed deco- ration was also applied to pithoi with the same kind of cylinders used on the hearths. Stamped patterns are also common on Cycladic pottery in this period. It is thought that the inspiration for this decorative process came from the borders of the eastern Mediterranean where the fashion of decorating pottery with cylinder and stamp seals developed in areas peripheral to Mesopotamia in the Early Bronze Age.54 The association of impressed decoration with hearths, noted in the Greek mainland and in the Cy- clades in EB II, occurs also in the eastern Mediter- ranean and is particularly tenacious in Anatolia, where clay furnishings have a long history. In many areas of Anatolia, hearths were provided with appen- dages, variously called pot stands, andirons or fen- ders, that are known in both fixed and portable ver- sions. They frequently bore impressed and incised decoration and, in some cases, were moulded in or decorated with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms. Such installations are associated with the ap- pearance of the Red-Black Burnished (or Khirbet Ke- rak) ware which spread from Transcaucasia and northeastern Anatolia into Syria and Palestine by EB III. Equally elaborate fixtures occur in areas of west- ern Anatolia where large hearths decorated with im- pressed circles and other stamped designs have been found at Beycesultan and at Kusura in second millen- nium contexts."6 Decorated hearths occur even in 44 For references to these hearths, see Lavezzi (supra n. 3) n. 9. 45 CMS V.2, nos. 457, 459-66, 468-74, 476-78, 480-82. 46 Delos: J.A.

Circular pan hearths found at Abydos, in lev- els dated by Petrie to Dynasty I, bear applied, incised and impressed decoration (pl. 25, fig. 5). The simple incised pattern on their rim is exactly the same as that of some fragments from Lerna57 and is combined with rows of impressed triangles, in a manner which, in the Aegean, is considered as characteristically Cycladic.58 In Crete the decoration of hearths displays a great- er variety than in the rest of the Aegean. Not surpris- ingly, the decorated examples have been found in the Phaistos palace and its vicinity. Stamped patterns oc- cur on HM 1621 and on some fragments; a number of other pieces have painted designs. This decorative ap- proach employing motifs current in Middle Minoan pottery seems to have been a particularly Cretan fash- ion at this time. The fixtures known from other sites were painted red or black or left undecorated. The hearths found in situ range in date from MM Ia to MM II.S"9 The earliest appears to be the circular ex- ample found in a house below the west koulouras at Knossos dated to MM Ia. This period in the central and southern parts of the island is generally agreed to have overlapped to a lesser or greater degree with EM III in eastern Crete.60 The securely dated examples from the mainland and the Cyclades, i.e., those found in situ, are EH/EC II. The hearth from Building BG at Lerna belongs to an early phase of this period. Fragments of undecorated pan hearths have been found in EH I context at Corinth'61 and fragmentary examples which offer the closest parallels to the Minoan rectan- gular hearths occur at Poliochni in levels usually cor- related with early Troy I.62 The lower limits of the use of such fixtures in the Aegean are uncertain, since only fragmentary material occurs in contexts later than mature EB II. The correlation of MM Ia with EC IIIB and EH III/MH I63 suggests that the adoption of specifically shaped and sometimes decorated fixed hearths in Mi- noan Crete lags somewhat behind their use in the Ae- gean. The existence in eastern Crete, an area with strong Cycladic ties in the Early Bronze Age, of at least one hearth closely related to Cycladic examples may be some indication that these fixtures were intro- duced into the island through the Cyclades. This piece is, however, unpublished and no information is avail- able on its exact provenance and find context. At pres- ent then, the process through which hearths of this type were introduced in Crete cannot be precisely de- termined, although it would be difficult to see their use on the island as unrelated to the fashion that pre- vailed in the Near East and the Aegean in the Early Bronze Age. Until the connecting links can be estab- lished, the comparative material cited here provides a background against which the Cretan hearths can be seen not as an isolated phenomenon, but in their prop- er context as installations which were constructed, shaped and decorated according to methods widely documented in neighboring regions.

In view of the still uncertain dating of the pottery from the relevant structures at Mallia, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how long the various hearths found at this site were in use. The rectan- gular example found in Quartier Theta belongs to MM Ib, accord- ing to the date assigned to this building by the same scholar (van Effenterre 1980, 167). This would also be his date for the circular examples found in the area of Chrysolakkos (see below p. 114, ns. 73-75) and in the South houses (van Effenterre 1980, 634). There is no doubt, in any case, that at Phaistos fixtures of both shapes were in use in the same period along with many braziers of various types. There is, therefore, no reason why the latter utensils should be connected with rectangular hearths in the MM II period, as hypothesized for Mallia (van Effenterre 1980, 165). The heart- shaped brazier singled out in this respect can be traced back to EM II at Myrtos (Warren [supra n. 7] 137, P 523-27, pl. 55, especially P 525).

The interaction between portable containers of fire and fixed hearths and between Cretan and Aegean hearths was an ongoing process. The rectangular Middle Minoan hearths were also made in portable versions, as a footed example from Phaistos indicates (pl. 26, fig. 8).64 In turn, the plastered and frequently painted tripod hearths, which became so popular in the Neopalatial period,65 are connected, on the one hand, with the painted rectangular Middle Minoan hearths and, on the other, with the great hearths of the Mycenaean megara with which they shared not only a general affinity of form, but also a common stock of decorative motifs, as Evans pointed out long ago.66 FIND CONTEXT AND FUNCTION The rectangular hearth from room VIII at Phaistos was the first discovered and remains the best known of these fixtures. No parallels were known at the time and its excavator interpreted it as an offering table for liquid offerings. Banti explained the bedding in which it was set as a means of protecting the floor of the room from spills.67 The presence of such a table was the main evidence for interpreting room VIII as a shrine, the focus of a cult complex which included rooms V-VII, IX and the open area to the north where another hearth (dubbed the "fossa sacrificale") was located. This interpretation, accepted by Evans and Nilsson,68 has never been challenged. Similar hearths discovered subsequently have accordingly been characterized as offering tables. The obvious traces of burning on that found in the tripartite build- ing west of the palace at Mallia led the excavator to modify this interpretation by identifying it as a fixture for burning sacrifices rather than for receiving liba- tions, in other words, as another "fossa sacrificale."'69 Both the tripartite building and room I.12 in Quartier Mu, where another rectangular hearth was found, have been interpreted as shrines.7" The pedestalled braziers from Phaistos were also called offering tables until recently.71 The systematic publication of these objects has finally placed them in their proper context among the other braziers and the terracotta lamps found in Middle Minoan levels at Phaistos. This study has also pointed out that the great numbers of these utensils and the traces of burn- ing which appear consistently on them exclude their identification as offering tables, while the areas where they have been found in situ bear no indication of reli- gious activity.72 The circular hearths have also not entirely escaped a ritual interpretation. Although Demargne identified a series of these hearths as utilitarian, domestic instal- lations, he reserved a ritual explanation for one exam- ple found in the area of Chrysolakkos (ill. 2) which, he speculated, could have held a lamp or a brazier to supply light or to burn incense in honor of the dead.73 This idea, however, is based on an interpretation of the find context which is by no means certain. The room in which this hearth was found (area f) most probably belonged to earlier levels below the funerary enclosure. The walls defining it on the north and east sides have the deepest foundations of all those located in this area of the enclosure and belong to a complex of regularly arranged compartments noted by the ex- cavators for their careful construction and shared characteristics, such as plastered floors and remains of white and red wall plaster.74 Two more circular hearths were found in compart- ments f and h in the earlier levels exposed to the east of the enclosure wall.75 Not only the hearths, but also other features of these structures find parallels in do- mestic architecture, but are unknown in tombs of the Middle Minoan period.'76 The excavators themselves noted the orderly plan and careful execution of these walls which correspond to the characteristics of the 64 Levi 1976, 267, fig. 420, pl. 165c. 65 For Middle Minoan examples painted red, see Pendlebury (supra n. 17) 56, pl. 11.3 and for others with painted decoration, M.R.

It is possible that the "cu- pules" noted in the successive plastered floors of the compartment which contained the plastered "altar" also represent a series of su- perimposed hearths of the same type; see Demargne 1932, 72 n. 1 and, in particular, pl. 5 for the clearest photograph of the fill in this area. It is suggestive that in discussing these features Demargne himself referred to the renewed layers of the hearth in the megaron at Mycenae. The "cupules" were interpreted as a kind of kernoi for offerings (Demargne 1932, 75). 7 Nicropoles 1, 40-42; pls. 38.2, 54-56, 57.3, 58.2. 76 Such features include the sectional wall in a, the benches lining several compartments, the plastered bin in h, the stairs and cobbled area beyond h.

It is, therefore, probable that all these remains belong to one complex of houses which extended below and be- yond the enclosure. The construction of the enclosure, which, as Shaw has definitively shown,77 employed re- used material, may then represent the first utilization or, at least, the earliest organization of this area for burials. It has, indeed, been noted that the region east of Chrysolakkos contains both habitation remains and burials of diverse dates.78 The reuse of a Middle Mi- noan house as a burial ground has also been suggested for the so-called "Maison des Morts," a structure sit- uated about 100 m. west of Chrysolakkos.79 The tendency to assign a religious or, at least, a dual function to hearths and related equipment has not been confined to Minoan examples of these objects. The Cycladic "hat vases" are a good case in point. The few examples known before the excavation of the cem- etery of Aghioi Anargyroi were found in settlement areas and have been considered as ritual vessels pre- sumably because of their form, which is unusual and impractical for a pot."8 In the publication of the mate- rial from Aghioi Anargyroi, the hat vases were inter- preted as braziers, but a cultic function was still sug- gested because of their association with graves.81 Nev- ertheless, just as in the case of the morphologically re- lated circular hearths found at Chrysolakkos, the in- terpretation of the find context can be questioned, since the "hat vases" from Aghioi Anargyroi were not ac- tually found in the graves. The nature of the other finds recovered from the excavation of the area but not from the graves themselves-i.e., coarse jar fragments, spindle whorls, stone net weights or pivot stones, a cru- cible (?), a schist mould (?) and, in particular, frag- ments of keyhole hearths decorated with impressed concentric circles-suggests that all this material is de- bris from a nearby settlement.82 Fixed hearths in the Aegean and in other areas as well have also been assigned, to a lesser or greater de- gree, a religious and/or ceremonial function. Such in- terpretations have been advanced for the hearths of the Early Helladic and Mycenaean megara, as well as for the West Anatolian and Khirbet Kerak installa- tions.83 In some cases, the buildings in which such fix- tures were found have been interpreted as shrines. Whether these ideas are generally accepted or not, they are, or at least purport to be, based on a balanced consideration of the evidence, the features of the hearths themselves (e.g., exceptional size and/or elab- orate decoration), as well as their find circumstances, such as their presence in prominent position within large, independent structures or in centrally located compartments of larger complexes. The associated finds have also played some role in the interpretation. In contrast, the initial identification of all Middle Minoan rectangular fixtures as offering tables has sufficed to prove their cultic function, and their pres- ence has marked the areas where they were installed as shrines. Since the evidence of the fixtures them- selves and the existing parallels clearly indicate that they were all hearths, and not objects of "no apparent domestic usefulness,"84 this assumption can no longer be unquestionably made. It seems only reasonable that some of the criteria commonly used in consider- ing whether such fixtures had a religious function should also be applied to the Minoan examples in or- der to clarify their specific role and the character of the places where they occur. One of these places, the complex containing room VIII at Phaistos, is the most widely accepted and frequently discussed example of a pre-LM III sanctuary identified within a settlement area. It is, therefore, of some importance to determine not only what are the special characteristics of the hearths which appear in this complex and in other 77 J.

The first use of this structure for burials cannot be assigned with certainty to MM I, the date of practically all the finds, or to LM III. The authors of the report have suggested that in MM I the building may have served as the house of a care- taker of the cemetery and also as a depository of provisions and gifts for the dead; its reuse for burials would date to LM III (Necropoles 2, 100-101; see also van Effenterre 1980, 236-37). More recently the earlier remains east of the Chrysolakkos enclosure were also interpreted as a house used by the caretaker/guard of the cemetery by van Effenterre, who considers the hearths found in this area and within the enclosure utilitarian rather than cultic installations (van Effenterre 1980, 243-44). 80 Papathanasopoulos (supra n. 51). 8' Doumas (supra n. 46) 103. 82 Doumas (supra n. 46) 117-20, pls. 44b-49a; see also p. 29 for a discussion of "one of the most characteristic features of Cycladic cemeteries," their close proximity to settlement sites. 83 Caskey (supra n. 43); Taylour (supra n. 10) 96; E.

Only five of the rectangular hearths found in posi- tion can be discussed, since not much relevant infor- mation is available on the examples discovered in Quartier Theta at Mallia and at Zakro. These five fixtures are certainly not remarkable in size, construc- tion or appearance. HM 1621 from room VIII at Phaistos is well made, but the only feature that distin- guishes it from other decorated hearths known from fragments is the motif of bovids, which may well have had a religious significance. The location of the five hearths varies: one is in the largest room of a small structure; another was found in a small room of a large complex; three were in var- ious areas of a palace. A brief discussion of these areas indicates that only one of these fixtures may have been centrally placed. The small building west of the palace at Mallia where a rectangular hearth was found has a simple plan: a vestibule gives access to the room in which the hearth was located and is flanked on the other side by a storeroom.85 The presence of the hearth and other finds led to its interpretation as a cult place which, on the basis of the plan, was described as an independent shrine.86 Within it the hearth, together with four flat stones set around it, occupied the central part of the largest room, but it is by no means certain that the building was an independent structure. The detailed description of the site makes it clear that some earlier walls had been incorporated in parts of the building, but the limited scope of the investi- gation has left unresolved its possible connection with other structures which may have existed near it.87 The excavator noted a large building which formed the northern border of a narrow lane running along the north side of the "shrine," but observed that the area to the west and south is lower and subject to flooding and would, therefore, be an unlikely location for an important structure.88 There are no reasons why a larger complex could not have extended into the unexcavated area to the east and southeast where resistivity tests have revealed the existence of substan- tial walls at some distance from the "shrine."89 Near the southeast corner of the excavated remains the be- ginning of a wall running south also suggests an ex- tension in that direction. At present then, the best de- scription that can be applied to this building at Mallia is that it was self-contained rather than independent. Building A in Quartier Mu is a large complex thought to have been of official, perhaps administra- tive, character rather than a private house. In its be- ginnings it dates to a late phase of MM I or to early MM II, but was extensively remodelled in MM II when a series of compartments was added to it on the south and southwest.90 Room I.12, in which a rectan- gular hearth was found, is one of these additions lo- cated immediately to the left of the new entrance to the building on the west side. It is entered through an anteroom and has no connection with the older part of the building except through a window of room 1.4 (a crypt or "lustral basin") against which it was built. It is situated away from the important rooms of the com- plex, both those contained in the original part and those added on during its remodelling, such as the "megaron" 1.13 or the "grande salle i banquettes" III.4. Its location near the new entrance cannot be considered as indicative of its importance or special character, since the other compartments that were added on in this area flanking the long entrance cor- ridor, III.15, were all storerooms. Not much can be said about the area near the cen- tral court of the Phaistos palace where another of these hearths was found, since its plan is incomplete. It was exposed during an in-depth exploration of ear- lier levels on both sides, i.e., to the east and west, of the western stylobate of the LM I palace, in front of rooms 22-25.91 The hearth was found fixed in the red plastered floor of a large compartment dated to the first phase of the early palace. The southern limit of this room was defined by a wall perpendicular to and extending beyond the LM I stylobate to the east.92 The stub of a contemporary wall with the same orien- tation was found a short distance northeast of the hearth. It may indicate an internal division of this compartment, the northern limits of which could not be determined. A step preserved east of the hearth suggests that the area extended farther in that direc- tion. Immediately south of this area traces of a drain dated to the same period were found below parts of another of later date.93 Farther south of the compart- 85 Poursat 1966, figs. 3-5. 86 Poursat 1966, 530. 87 B.

Plan of rooms V-IX of the early palace at Phaistos (final phase). (After Fesths 1, fig. 309) ment with the hearth, walls of the first phase form another room apparently oriented toward the south. The excavator believes that it may belong to a row that formed the southern limit of the central court of this phase. It appears, then, that this hearth was lo- cated in a large room at, or at least near, the southwest corner of the central court of the early palace. Much more is known about room VIII, which is lo- cated at the northwest corner of the palace. It formed part of a complex which included rooms V-IX and the area north of them (ill. 5). This complex was the result of successive remodellings that altered the orig- inal facade of the palace. The alterations included the opening of a doorway in the west wall of room VI, which placed the area in direct communication with the west court of the palace. In contrast, no communi- cation existed between these rooms and the rest of the wing to the south. In her discussion of rooms V-IX, Banti remarked that the west approach must have always been of sec- ondary importance.94 In fact, it can be argued that this opening was not meant to provide an approach to the rooms at all. The plans illustrating the stages in the remodelling of this area95 indicate that the open- ing of the west doorway coincides with the use of the open space north of room VIII for the construction of a large hearth, the "fossa sacrificale." This connection between the complex and the space to the north of it is clearly demonstrated by the positioning of the west door of room VI and the stepped arrangement which effectively links the two areas. The curved plan of the poorly preserved "vano nord" was also noted by Banti as having perhaps been designed to facilitate the com- munication of the rooms with the "fossa."'96 The rea- son for the construction of a circuitous rather than a direct approach to the area of the outdoor hearth lies in the elevation of the bedrock which rises rather sharply toward the north and had actually been cut to form the lower part of the north and west walls of room V (pl. 27, fig. 14).97 Consequently, the west doorway of room VI, rather than making rooms V-VI and VIII-IX accessible from the outside, in fact served the reverse purpose. Thus, the purpose of this whole complex was to serve the interior of the palace. Its connection with that area is, however, unknown, as is the function of the rooms covered by the Neopa- latial reconstruction. Of these only the large store- room XXXIV below room 69 was investigated."s The parts exposed south of VIII-IX do not seem, on the basis of the plan and the finds, to have accommodated important ceremonial or living quarters.99 The compactness of the plan of rooms V-IX is ac- centuated by the fixtures found in them. The hearth of room VIII is essentially a smaller, more carefully made version of the "fossa sacrificale." All the rooms, except VII (a tiny cubicle, accessible only from the outside, which represents a late utilization of the jut- ting angle of VI), are well supplied with benches. Benches lined the passage connecting VIII with IX, an arrangement which suggests that the latter was an annex of the former. A small cupboard was hollowed out in a bench in VIII. In V and VI the benches were associated with other features. In V the bench had a cavity next to which a quern was found. In VI a drain ran below one bench; the other was furnished with a potstand and a sort of basin of plastered limestone slabs. The features in these two rooms were inter- preted by the excavators as connected with the prepa- ration of cereals and liquids used in the cult activities in room VIII, the shrine itself.1"0 94 Festas 2, 575. 5 Festas 2, figs. 305-306, 309. 96 Festas 2, 575.

Nothing indicative of religious activity was found in the vicinity of the hearth located near the central court of the Phaistos palace. Much domestic pottery dating to the first phase of the early palace was col- lected along the southern wall of the compartment in which the hearth was discovered.'07 Nor have cult ob- jects apparently been found in room 1.12 of Quartier Mu. In its anteroom, which was furnished with a bench, pottery was stored in a recess.'08 In contrast, practically all the finds from the MM II "shrine" at Mallia that could somehow be consid- ered of religious significance have been so interpreted. Among them only two clay animal figurines and a fragment of a terracotta triton shell could possibly be included under this heading. Two of these objects were not part of the floor deposits.1'9 None of them was found in the room with the hearth which, how- ever, contained a real triton shell. Of the other con- tents of this room, four portable "offering tables" must be braziers. Two bore traces of burning. All are simi- lar in profile and finish to the pedestalled braziers from Phaistos although, unlike the latter, they have no cavity.110 The bottom of a tripod vessel stamped with a double axe design, which was found reversed on top of the hearth, is a fragmentary example of a type of cooking tray well known from Phaistos.11"' In its broken condition this utensil must have been used to help extinguish the fire. A jar embedded in the floor near the door, interpreted as a receptacle for liba- tions,112 is a common appendage of hearths meant for either storage or collection of refuse. Many sherds of coarse pots were found among the stones of a poorly preserved bench in the southeast corner of the room by which lay a crushed cooking pot. The only other fea- tures of the room which are of interest are four flattish stones set around the hearth. The position of one, set near the northwest corner of the hearth, suggests that it is the base of a roof support, an idea entertained but discarded by the excavator113; the other three must have been potstands. INTERPRETATION This brief survey of rectangular Middle Minoan hearths indicates that little exists to connect them with religion and cult. They themselves were not spe- cially made religious objects, but simply one of sever- al types of fixed hearths which, as the accumulating evidence indicates, were widely used in this period. The material from Phaistos shows that several hearths of rectangular shape were used concurrently in the palace and in its immediate area. Some frag- ments from this site and a more completely preserved crude specimen from Quartier Theta at Mallia were found in modest private houses.

The location of three of these hearths, those found in 1.12 in Quartier Mu and in rooms V-IX at Phai- stos, can only be called peripheral. Both areas appear as self-contained units, relatively isolated but never- theless forming part of areas which appear (quite clearly in Quartier Mu, less certainly at Phaistos) to have housed service quarters, such as storerooms. Only one hearth, F 6724 from Phaistos, may be said to have occupied a central location. Another, at Mal- lia, may have done so, if the building in which it was found was unattached. No trace of religious activity can be discerned in the finds associated with the for- mer, and the independent character of the "shrine" at Mallia is questionable. On the other hand, the plan and organization of the latter find a good parallel in room 1.12 in Quartier Mu with its anteroom and small storeroom. The peripheral location and/or self-contained plan of certain units within Minoan palatial complexes have been taken as suggestive of religious function.114 Much has also been written about the unpretentious plan and furnishings of Minoan cult areas found in palaces and settlements, and it has come to be taken almost for granted that they are often found "in the midst of other rooms used for domestic and everyday activities.""5 The subject is much too large to be treated in detail in this article. It should, however, be noted that these observations, in so far as they pertain to the period of the palaces, are based on the charac- teristics of areas such as those under discussion here and, ultimately, on the features of rooms V-IX at Phaistos which "in considering the question of the ground plan, the function of the various rooms and the ease of access are the best example [of a palatial shrine] to study.""'16 Yet it is precisely these features and their location that not only are most difficult to reconcile with a cultic function of these rooms and of the other areas discussed here, but also make far bet- ter sense if a religious interpretation is abandoned. As mentioned earlier, although widely used in the period of the second palaces, braziers and portable hearths did not entirely oust permanent hearths. Cir- cular hearths of clay without a cavity and a rectan- gular type made up of individual bricks have been found in LM I houses at Mallia.'7 A fireplace with a chimney in the corner of the main room of a small LM I house at Prasas represents another type of cooking-heating installation."8 But these are rare finds. As a result, it has been argued (usually on the basis of modern parallels) that cooking activities which needed a permanent installation must have been carried out in areas adjacent to the buildings, in the open or in flimsy structures not commonly identi- fied or excavated.'" The discovery of a kitchen on the north side of the central court in the palace at Zakro indicates that this was not always the case. Room XXXII at Zakro, a large compartment with two rows of pillars, was furnished with a hearth and a large amount of portable kitchen equipment (cooking pots, braziers, a grill, a mortar, etc.) which were found in the room itself and in its annexes. Many animal bones were also found in these areas.120 It seems certain that this well equipped kitchen served a banquet hall lo- cated above it, on the upper storey. The discovery of the kitchen at Zakro gains added significance since it provides welcome confirmation for the proposed iden- tification, in at least two other LM I palaces, of simi- lar arrangements of kitchen quarters, storerooms and banquet hall.121 The location of these units in LM I may be similar to that of the area near the central court of the early palace at Phaistos where the rectangular hearth could mark the location of a large kitchen supplying a din- ing area near or above it. Conversely, the kitchen in room I.12 of Building A in Quartier Mu and the com- plex at the northwestern corner of the palace at Phai- stos aptly illustrate the peripheral siting considered 14 E.g., by Banti in Festds 2, 582-83 and in "I culti minoici e greci di Haghia Triada," ASAtene N.S. 3-4 (1941-1943) 45-46, where she argued that cult rooms initially set apart within buildings be- came eventually, after MM III, independent shrines. Even Nils- son, (supra n. 68) 77, n. 1, who criticized this position, stated it was only natural that "the cult room was isolated from the rooms used for practical purposes and finally, as at Gournia, became a public sanctuary." The public character of the so-called MM II "shrine" at Mallia, cautiously hinted at by its excavator (Poursat 1966, 530), has been maintained by van Effenterre (1980, 442-44), who char- acterizes it as a town shrine. 115 Rutkowski (supra n. 87) 224. 116 Rutkowski (supra n. 87) 224. 117 Maisons 2, 12-13, pl. 3.2; 30-31; pl. 7.1. van Effenterre (supra n. 15) 97-98, pl. 55.1-2. 118 N.

Similarly, the MM II "shrine" west of the palace at Mallia can be best understood as a service area of specialized function attached to a larger complex; there is evi- dence that large buildings existed in its immediate vi- cinity. The finds from this structure do not justify its identification as a cult place; they form instead an as- semblage wholly appropriate for a kitchen. The simi- larity of the plan of this complex to that of the peak shrine at Jukhtas, adduced by the excavator,122 is not valid, since the plan of the structures at Jukhtas used in this comparison is that sketched by Evans, which does not correspond to what has been uncovered in the recent systematic exploration of this site.123 On the other hand, the allocation of the restricted amount of space encompassed by the building at Mallia can be paralleled in room 1.12 and its annexes in Quartier Mu, but makes no sense for a small private house; its plan is totally unlike that of contemporary houses at the site, even those of unpretentious character.124 The central location of fixed hearths in the Middle Minoan houses at Mallia has been noted.125 The plan of those excavated south of the palace reveals that these fixtures were usually placed in the largest or one of the largest compartments. On several occasions these rooms and/or the areas adjacent to them were well equipped with benches.126 This arrangement conforms to the organization of small private dwell- ings which would not have many areas of specialized function. In such houses the area with the hearth must have served as a kitchen and dining room, and also as a living and working area in the winter. In a larger com- plex like Building A in Quartier Mu, which, whether as an official establishment or as a private residence, must have accommodated a substantial number of people, a greater specialization in the use of space is to be expected. There, the cooking facilities are relegated to a peripheral, service area. Finally, in a palace which, in addition to living quarters, contained store- rooms, workrooms, business offices and ceremonial chambers and in which many classes of people worked, lived and were admitted as visitors, several areas of varied elaboration must have been provided for the preparation of food and its consumption. The excavation of the early palace at Phaistos has revealed several areas with fixed hearths. Whether these fixtures were used for cooking or only to supply warmth and light or for both purposes must be deter- mined in each case by the find context. Thus, the sug- gestion that the rectangular hearth found near the central court may have been a cooking installation can only be tentative, since the evidence of the plan and of the finds is not as complete and conclusive as that available in rooms V-IX or in the MM II "shrine" at Mallia. On the other hand, certain features of rooms V-IX -specifically the disposition of the benches in VIII-IX, which is reminiscent of the arrangement in the Middle Minoan houses at Mallia discussed above, and the presence of indoor and outdoor hearths-in- dicate that this complex in its final phase was some- thing more than a kitchen, i.e., that in addition to cooking it provided dining facilities. The preparation of food would take place in V and VI, while most of the cooking would have been carried out in the open area to the north. Utensils could be stored in VII. Rooms VIII-IX would have served as dining areas, with the indoor hearth used to provide warmth and perhaps also as a supplementary or alternate cooking installation. The best parallel for the arrangement of rooms VIII-IX within the palace is in rooms LIX-LX of the southwest wing.127 These two rooms are intercon- nected in a similar way as VIII-IX and both are sup- plied with benches. In LIX a brazier fixed in the floor corresponds to the hearth of VIII. Room LIX has been interpreted as a waiting room, but together with LX could well have been a dining area. A stone basin fixed in a corner of the room suggested to the exca- vator that facilities for washing were provided here for the visitors128-provisions more appropriate to the utilization of this area for dining. More significantly, rooms LIX-LX are surrounded by storage areas (LVIII a-e, LXI-LXIII, LXV) where much domes- tic pottery, wine and other provisions were kept129 and, like V-IX, are located near the outer corner of the wing and have direct access to the courtyard.

Whether these "houses" represent agglomerations of smaller units sharing access ways or complexes inhabited by multi- ple "cellules familiales," as has been recently suggested by van Ef- fenterre (1980, 164), is an academic distinction in this respect. It is possible that some hearths in this area, as in no. 4 of the east part of "House" A, and perhaps also in the L-shaped area of the west part to which both sections of the "House" had access, were located in the open and were used as alternate or supplementary cooking facilities. 127 Levi 1976, 121-33, figs. 164-88. 128 Levi 1976, 122-23. 129 Levi 1976, 110-20, 137-51, pl.

This part of the palace was greatly disturbed by later structures which could have obliterated the remains of such an area. The fact that LIX was provided from the beginning with a rela- tively wide, well constructed approach from the west may indicate that, unlike the complex in the north, this unit served visitors or personnel working primar- ily beyond the confines of the palace. The more elabo- rate fixtures of the northwest complex may, in turn, reflect the comparatively higher status of the people accommodated there. The designation of the units with rectangular hearths as domestic rather than cultic need not mean that no religious activity took place there; evidence for such activity exists, particularly in rooms V-IX at Phaistos. They were not only furnished with a hearth marked with a symbol of probable religious signifi- cance, but also numbered among their contents four libation tables and a triton shell. Proportionally, these objects form a small group among the other contents of this area, but, as the extensive literature on this subject makes clear, the sparse representation of cultic objects has never been an obstacle to the identification of an area within a Minoan palace or settlement as a shrine. Not even the realization by some scholars that the Middle Minoan rectangular fixtures were hearths rather than tables for liquid offerings has affected their belief in the cultic function of these fixtures. It might indeed be argued that a cult place (whether public or domestic) furnished with a hearth would not be out of place in Middle Minoan Crete, where fire played an important role in the rituals practiced in country shrines. Such an interpretation was suggested by Banti for rooms V-IX at Phaistos because of the existence of the so-called "fossa sacrificale."'30 If, however, such a link between sanctuaries lo- cated in settlements and country shrines is to be as- sumed, then some evidence of other similarities should also be expected. Yet votives which abound in country shrines of the period are absent in room VIII and in the other "sanctuaries" with hearths. The cult objects found in these areas cannot be considered sufficient evidence for identifying them as cult places. If the so- called Middle Minoan II "shrine" near the palace at Mallia was meant for public use, then, despite its lo- cation in the midst of a well populated area during a period of great prosperity and development, it was poorer than even the most modest country shrines.131 If rooms V-IX at Phaistos are to be considered as a cult place attached to an important palatial center, then the comparative paucity and modest quality of their portable furnishings are hard to explain. It is also not easy to understand why all the "shrines" of this type, and especially that at Phaistos, should have been completely obliterated and forgotten at the end of the first palace period, while contemporary country shrines continued to develop. Rituals involving the use of fire were still practiced at peak shrines during the period of the second palaces and lasted even longer at places such as Jukhtas, the cave of Psychro and the sanctuary at Syme. Yet, as noted by Banti,132 the "fossa sacrificale" at Phaistos was buried, although the area where it was located was not affected by the building of the second palace, so it could have easily continued in use. If, however, the Middle Minoan "shrines" at Phaistos and Mallia were actually do- mestic areas, then their abandonment requires no ex- planation. Nor is one necessary for any changes that might have been made in the location and internal ar- rangement of areas used for cooking and dining in the complexes that were rebuilt in the Neopalatial period, since the disposition of such areas would be adapted to the general plan and organization of the new build- ings and would also reflect, to some extent, the fact that the fixed hearths current in the Middle Minoan period had gone out of use. Thus, from every point of view, the interpretation of rooms V-IX and of the "shrines" at Mallia as areas of domestic function seems to account best for all the evidence available (or, for that matter, lacking) in these places. In the same way, the presence of some religious objects within these areas can be best under- stood as evidence of domestic cult practices. There is certainly ample evidence that the preparation and, in particular, the consumption of food, an especially im- portant daily activity, are closely connected with rit- uals, such as sacrifice and libation, in many cultures and periods. It is more than probable that the cultic objects found in the complex of rooms V-IX at Phai- stos were used in religious acts that accompanied the main activity for which this complex was designed.133 Such practices would also account for the use of reli- gious symbols on a hearth. Permanent installations for cooking certainly did not disappear in Crete with the end of the first pal- 130 Festas 2, 580. The presence of rectangular hearths in the MM II "shrine" at Mallia, in room 1.12 at Quartier Mu and in room VIII at Phaistos has also been considered evidence for the practice of similar rituals in town shrines and in domestic and palatial cult places (van Effenterre 1980, 448). 131 See Davaras (supra n. 7) 51 on the wealth of objects found in poor or looted peak shrines. 132 Festas 2, 580. 133 For a similar interpretation of Transcaucasian hearths, see C. Burney and D.M. Lang, The Peoples of the Hills (London 1971) 77-78.</page><page sequence="16">122 POLYMNIA METAXA MUHLY [AJA 88 aces, nor were they all relegated to outlying areas in large complexes, as the Zakro kitchen demonstrates. For all practical purposes, however, the freestanding hearths of specific shapes meant for cooking and/or heating purposes did go out of use at that time. Evans thought that the changeover to portable hearths oc- curred under the influence of other cultures in the southeastern Mediterranean, specifically under that of Egypt, an opinion shared by Demargne.134 It is possible, however, that more than a shift in fashion underlay this change. Open, fixed hearths where fire is usually preserved overnight135 represent serious fire hazards. This factor, as well as the desire to avoid smoke and odors, may already have been taken into consideration in the large Middle Minoan establish- ments where kitchens seem to have been set away from the central quarters. The effects of uncontrol- lable fire on buildings which utilized wood extensive- ly in the frameworks and in architectural details have been vividly demonstrated by the excavation of Quar- tier Mu, which was destroyed at the end of MM II or a little later.'136 In basement areas where the fire had burned fiercest, vases and sherds were swollen, blis- tered, twisted and bent, while bricks were trans- formed into a sort of slag and partially vitrified.

It should be noted, however, that permanent installations for cooking and heat- ing purposes are well attested in Egypt. Fireplaces built against the wall were found in houses of the Middle Kingdom at Kahun (W.M.F. Petrie, Kahun, Gurob, and Hawara [London 1890] 23), but freestanding hearths of clay in the shape of circular dishes ce- mented to the floor served to warm the principal room of work- men's houses at Amarna (E.T.

O'Connor who supplied me with several useful references to Egyp- tian hearths. 135 This seems to be the most reasonable explanation for the pres- ence of cavities in many fixed hearths (van Effenterre 1980, 165). In the case of the Middle Minoan hearths supporting evidence can be gleaned from the projecting rims and more intense traces of burning in and around cavities that occur in some examples (see, e.g., here pl. 26, fig. 7, ill. 2; Poursat 1966, 531). 136 Quartier Mu 1, 25; van Effenterre 1980, 36, n. 62. 137 Quartier Mu 1, 21.</page><page sequence="17">MUHLY PLATE 25 FIG.
