For nearly three quarters of a century, archaeologists have sought to uncover the origins of pottery in the Southwest in relationship to shifting patterns of subsistence and settlement and the formation of distinct local and regional identities; processes that accompanied the change from a purely hunting gathering, Archaic lifeway to one based on maize agriculture and village life between ca. 1200 B.C. and A.D. 700.The prevailing consensus that emerged by the 1980s held that all of the regional pottery traditions of the Southwest, including the well-known Hohokam, Mogoll?n, and Anasazi traditions, had developed from a common early plain ware horizon (Blinman 1993; LeBlanc 1982a; Wilson and Blinman 1993; Woodbury and Zubrow 1979).The existing evidence suggested that around the end of the second century of the Chris tian Era, pottery technology had spread rapidly out of northwestern Mexico, first to the lowland southern deserts of Arizona and then north and eastward to the highland regions of the Mogoll?n Rim and Colorado Plateau (Figure 1 ) (Haury 1976; LeBlanc 1982a; Schroeder 1982).The development and spread of pottery technology was assumed to be associated with increasing sedentism and a greater reliance on cultigens, which, it was believed, created new de Figure 1. Map of North American Southwest showing major geographic divisions and archaeological areas where important early pottery finds have been discovered.</page><page sequence="4">68 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 mands for durable storage containers and efficient food processing facilities (Crown and Wills 1995; Huckell 1996). Recent finds in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona have begun to radically redefine our understanding of both the timing and context of early pottery production in the North American Southwest. Fired clay figurines have been recovered from sites nearTucson that date as early as ca. 1200-800 B.C. (B. Huckell 1990:239-240), while two Early Ci?nega phase (ca. 800-400 B.C.) settlements in the middle Santa Cruz River Valley have yielded fragments of small ceramic containers (Heidke 1997; Heidke and Ferg 1997b), indicating that the antiquity of pottery production in the southern deserts of the North American Southwest is much greater than had previously been believed.These simple ceramic vessels were poorly designed for general domestic tasks and are often found in contexts indicative of ritual, ceremonial, or integrative func tions (Heidke and Ferg 1997a). Not until after A.D. 150 did desert potters begin to produce simple, plain ware jars suitable for storage, and it was well into the sixth century before a full range of food preparation, cooking, serving, and storage vessels were commonly available. Thus, it now appears that in habitants of the Sonoran Desert experimented with ceramic technology for more than a millennium before the production and use of pottery containers became an essential and ubiquitous part of their daily subsistence activities. The plateau and highland regions of the northern Southwest have yet to yield evidence of pottery production or use of comparable antiquity. Although occasional associations of simple brown ware pottery with radiocarbon dates in the A.D. 200s have been reported (Burton 1991 ; Eddy 1966; LeBlanc 1982a), the earliest, well-established structural tree ring dates clearly associated with ceramic containers do not occur in the Mogoll?n region until the early A.D. 300s (Haury and Sayles 1947) and in the Anasazi region until the late A.D. 400s (Breternitz 1986). The earliest well-made pottery containers in the northern Southwest occur in a limited range of simple forms, including the ubiquitous neckless "seed jar" that is the most common vessel form re covered from contemporary sites located in the Sonoran Desert. Again, it is not until after ca. A.D. 500/550, that we see the development of the full range of cooking and serving vessels usually associated with Southwestern pottery assemblages. It is also at about this time that the surface treatment and paint ing of vessels, especially of large, open serving bowls, takes on greater sig nificance and we begin to see a clear divergence, both technologically and stylistically, among the major regional ceramic traditions of the North Ameri can Southwest. Thus, current evidence suggests that we can no longer think of the origin and spread of pottery technology in the Southwest as a unitary and uniform phenomenon. Rather, at least three distinct episodes of innova tion and development can now be identified. The first episode is associated with the initial development of ceramic tech nology by inhabitants of the Sonoran Desert during the first millennium B.C.</page><page sequence="5">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 69 Fired clay figurines, beads, and small cup-like vessels may have played an important role in emerging rituals associated with ancestor worship, commu nity integration, and agricultural productivity. Unfired clay figurines and clay bowls molded in baskets have occasionally been recovered from Archaic and Early Agricultural contexts in the northern Southwest (Coulam and Schroedl 1996; Martin 1952; E.H. Morris 1927; E.A. Morris 1980).These remains may represent a similar period of experimentation with the plastic properties of clay and the use of clay objects in ritual contexts. However, these experi ments do not seem to have led to the independent development of fired ce ramic technology in the north. The second episode of ceramic innovation, between ca. A.D. 150 to 500/ 550, is characterized by the rapid adoption of a more sophisticated domestic, utilitarian ceramic container technology throughout the North American South west. It is this later "container revolution" (following Smith 1986) which has been the focus of most discussions of the origins of pottery in the Southwest. Like other observers (Crown and Wills 1995; Henderson 1992; Reid 1995; Whittlesey 1995c), we see this second episode in the development and spread of pottery in the Southwest as closely associated with an increasing demand for durable storage containers that accompanied increased sedentism and a greater reliance on cultigens. The third episode in the initial development of prehistoric Southwestern pottery occurred between ca. A.D. 500/550 and 700. During this period of economic intensification (cf. Crown and Wills, 1995), pottery containers be came integrated into the entire range of food processing, cooking, and serv ing activities. It was also at about this time that the potential of pottery as a medium for symbolic expression and information exchange began to be real ized. These technological and stylistic changes mark the emergence of the major regional ceramic traditions of the Southwest. As other recent studies have pointed out (Hoopes and Barnett 1995), the reasons for the development of pottery technology throughout the world re flect a complex mix of ecological, economic, social, and symbolic factors played out in a series of unique historical and cultural contexts. In order to under stand the early occurrence and spread of pottery technology in the North American Southwest, we must examine each of these episodes of innovation and development within the context of local patterns of ecological, econo mic, and cultural diversity that characterized the highland and lowland re gions of the Southwest during the Late Archaic/Early Agricultural period. Episode 1: The Initial Development of CeramicTechnology in the Sonoran Desert Until quite recently, the relationship between the origins of agriculture, sedentism, and ceramics in the North American Southwest were poorly un</page><page sequence="6">70 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 derstood. We now know that in the Sonoran Desert area of Southeastern Arizona, the occupation of settlements with multiple pit structures, large stor age pits, thick trash middens, burials, and other types of features generally thought to represent some degree of sedentism correlates with the introduc tion of agriculture in the area during the Late Archaic period, ca. 800 B.C. A.D. 150 (Freeman 1997; Gregory 1997b; Mabry 1997b). Hill (1997) presents linguistic evidence that the diffusion of maize into the Southwest occurred during a period of coherence among southern Uto-Aztecan languages, but that the appearance of pottery occurred at a time when linguistic boundaries were starting to emerge. In southeastern Arizona, the first ceramic contai ners were produced at settlements practicing maize agriculture, but they were preceded by ceramic figurine production.The earliest maize and ceramic figu rines in the Tucson Basin have been recovered from San Pedro phase con texts, ca. 1200-800 B.C. (B. Huckell 1990; Huckell et al. 1995), whereas ceramic containers were not produced until the Early Ci?nega phase (ca. 800 400 B.C.). In theTucson Basin, many Early Ci?nega and Late Ci?nega (ca. 400 B.C. A.D. 150) phase sites are located on lowland alluvial landforms suitable for flood water farming during the summer monsoons (B. Huckell 1997). Macrobotanical data indicate that these sites were occupied from at least early spring through late fall (L. Huckell 1997). One of the most striking as pects of Early Ci?nega and, especially, Late Ci?nega phase pit structures is the large number and volume of floor pits found inside them. Lisa Huckell (1997) has suggested that, although there are no winter-indicator plant re sources in the Sonoran Desert, the presence of maize remains in these stor age pits can be considered a possible indicator of winter occupation. The establishment of agricultural settlements would have affected the an nual schedules of interaction with other groups that took place before a settled lifeway was adopted, and transformed the structure of communication within and among local groups (Wilcox 1986:141).The establishment of "Big Houses" at some Early and Late Ci?nega phase sites may, in part, have been a re sponse to that transformation.The term "Big House" has been applied to struc tures that are up to three times larger than other structures at a site (Mabry 1997a). However, the "Big House" at one site may be considerably smaller than the "Big House" at another site. This scalar variability may reflect func tional differentiation much like that present among the Huichol Indians of north central Mexico who have two types of religious buildings: small local, or family, god houses and larger community temples (Myerhoff 1974:108-110). Late Ci?nega phase pottery was first described in Kisselburg's (1993) analy sis of ceramics recovered from the Coffee Camp site. More recently, Early Ci?nega phase pottery has been recovered from the Clearwater and Wet lands sites (Heidke 1997; Heidke and Ferg 1997b), and additional samples of Late Ci?nega phase pottery have been recovered from the Los Pozos and</page><page sequence="7">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 71 Santa Cruz Bend sites (Heidke and Ferg 1997a; Heidke et al. 1997). Other Late Ci?nega phase sites, such as the Donaldson site (B. Huckell 1995) and Stone Pipe (Swartz and Lindeman 1997), have not produced ceramics. To date, only plain wares have been recovered from typologically unmixed, Early and Late Ci?nega phase contexts, even though significant quantities of red ochre (which was used by later potters for red slips and paint) have been recovered from some of the early pottery-bearing sites. Given the position that these pots hold at the beginning of the regional ceramic sequence and the fact that they do not resemble later, Hohokam plain ware types (Kelly 1978), Heidke and Ferg (1997a) have proposed the label'lncipient plain ware" be used to denote their status. Currently, four distinct varieties of incipient plain ware have been identified, based on differences in construction tech nique and surface treatment. Heidke and Ferg (1997a) refer to the varieties as coiled, bumpy, impressed, and incised. So far, portions of 84 incipient plain ware vessels have been recovered. Compositional research indicates that Early and Late Ci?nega phase pot ters used "untempered" clays. Production of pottery from "untempered" clay is restricted to this earliest portion of the regional ceramic sequence. "Self-tem pered" alluvial clays were used in the subsequent Agua Caliente phase, but not thereafter.Throughout the rest of the prehistoric sequence, potters in the Sonoran Desert added sand or crushed micaceous rock tempers to their clay. Taken together, the Ci?nega and Agua Caliente phase data suggest that it took potters many generations to gain familiarity with the various resources available in the region, and to develop mixtures of plastic and nonplastic ma terials that would produce workable clay bodies suitable for a wide range of domestic functions. Two methods of primary forming were utilized: coiling and pinching. Pinched vessels have either bumpy, hand-smoothed surfaces or incised surfaces. The vessel shape represented by most sherds was not determined, but Heidke and Ferg (1997a) offer inferences based on thirteen rim sherds. Most are small bowls, with an average orifice diameter of just 7.4 cm.These are unusu ally small vessels relative to those produced throughout the rest of theTucson Basin's prehistory. Like the bowls, the jars are unusually small vessels, with an average aperture diameter of 3.0 cm. A single jar vessel form has been documented as the neckless "seed jar." Arnold (1985:19,225) has suggested that, in every culture, pottery making almost certainly originated as a result of innovation within the culture or diffu sion from another culture. Recently, David Kelley (1992, in Clark and Gosser 1995:209) has suggested a third process: "dependent invention." Dependent invention refers to the acceptance of ideas and technical knowledge by a borrowing group, and the technology's rapid application and modification in ways foreign to its use by the donor group (Clark and Gosser 1995:209). At least three pottery complexes are known to have been present in Mexico by</page><page sequence="8">72 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 1600 B.C. (Clark and Gosser 1995). They are the Barra complex of coastal Chiapas, the Purr?n-Espiridi?n complex of the Tehuac?n Valley and Oaxaca, and the Chajil complex of northern Veracruz. Kelly (1980) describes another early ceramic complex, Capacha monochrome and its slipped and painted variants, from the states of Colima and Jalisco.Thus, the Early Ci?nega phase pottery recovered from sites in the middle Santa Cruz River Valley may be a result of the diffusion of ceramic manufacturing technologies from the south, or a dependent invention that is contingent upon knowledge of those tech nologies. As Woodbury and Zubrow (1979:52) note, "The explanation for the initial appearance of pottery in the Southwest that requires fewest unproved assumptions is that it spread northward from Mesoamerica, where it has far greater antiquity." Unfortunately, there is so little archaeological data available from Early Ag ricultural period sites in Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico (B. Huckell 1996:345, 357) that we cannot evaluate those hypotheses properly. Accordingly, we can not yet rule out the possibility that pottery making is an innovation that arose in the Sonoran Desert during the Early Ci?nega phase, or an invention that is dependent upon previous knowledge gained from making anthropomorphic fired clay figurines, such as those recovered from the San Pedro phase Milagro site (B. Huckell 1990:239-240).The possibility that pottery making is an innova tion, oran invention dependent upon local knowledge, is strengthened when we consider that the coiled variety has only been recovered from Early Ci?nega phase sites.The replacement of a perishable container technology (basketry) with a ceramic substitute is a particularly satisfying explanation for this early variety, which looks like nothing so much as a "clay basket" (Heidke 1997: Figure 10.3). The antecedents of the other incipient plain ware varieties are more prob lematic, but the bumpy and incised varieties, given their size and type of deco ration, may have replaced another type of perishable container, particularly those made from gourds.Three species of wild gourds occur in Arizona. The two most common species produce round, baseball-sized fruits (L. Huckell 1997), and the average opening of the bumpy and incised bowls is 6.3 cm (Heidke and Ferg 1997a), slightly smaller than the diameter of a baseball. Native gourds could have been used as containers, although they do not lend themselves to use as tools because their thin rinds are easily broken (L. Huckell 1997). A ceramic container would, therefore, have made a less fragile substi tute. The bumpy variety of incipient plain ware has also been recovered from Early Ci?nega phase sites. Therefore, the two varieties documented at Early Ci?nega phase sites may have replicated in clay earlier basketry and gourd container forms. The straight, curved, wavy, and parallel line incised motifs present on the incised variety of incipient plain ware are shared with the West ern Archaic rock art tradition (Wallace and Holmlund 1986), which started</page><page sequence="9">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 73 ca. 8000 B.C. and continued until A.D. 800. It is possible that these design elements may also have been used to decorate less durable media, such as gourds and, later, ceramics. If we believe Braun's (1983:107) now famous dictum that pots are "tools" we must search for the functions that these early ceramic containers served. One hypothesis is that pottery was invented in order to detoxify foods and make them more palatable, whereas another set of hypotheses proposes that early pottery functioned as a prestige good, particularly in the context of competitive feasting (Hoopes and Barnett 1995:3).The orifice diameter mea surements reviewed above have shown that the incipient plain wares are very small vessels. It seems unlikely that these small vessels would have been of much use in food processing or competitive feasting. Rather, aspects of their (incised) iconography and their recovery contexts suggest that they may have been "ritual" goods. Almost one-half (43%) of these early ceramics were recovered from fea tures that have been interpreted as having a ceremonial, ritual, or integrative function rather than a domestic function based on criteria other than the pres ence of ceramics. Foremost among these are the "Big Houses" found at some of the sites. One of the two Early Ci?nega phase sites and two of the four Late Ci?nega phase sites contain at least one "Big House" in the investigated part of the site, and ceramics have been recovered from the fill (and in some cases the floor pits) of at least one "Big House" at each of these sites. The "Big Houses," or in the case of Los Pozos, a pit structure with a ceremonial cache on its floor (Gregory 1997a), contain greater quantities of these early ceram ics than do other pit structures that were investigated at these and other con temporary sites. Given their small size, their iconography, and their association with non domestic contexts, Heidke and Ferg (1997a) have suggested two possible ritual functions that this early pottery may have served. The small bowls that make up the majority of incipient plain ware vessels are well suited to the task of serving individual portions of a liquid or holding offerings. Ritual uses of similar small containers have been documented in ethnographies of Sonoran peoples and groups living in northern Mesoamerica. For example, theTohono O'odham of the Sonoran Desert (Underhill 1938:21-41) used gourd cups in their saguaro wine ceremony, which marked the onset of the summer rainy season and the beginning of the agricultural cycle. Sonoran Desert peoples were becoming increasingly reliant on maize ag riculture during the Early and Late Ci?nega phases. Larger mano sizes were developed and the grinding surface area of metates was increased making them more efficient for dry-grinding meal or flour than earlier manos and metates had been (Adams 1997). Thus, a ritual associated with maize agri culture, similar to those reported by Bohrer (1994) from throughout the Ameri cas, could have been established at this early time.</page><page sequence="10">74 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 An alternative function is suggested by the Huichol Indians' use of small gourd bowls to hold offerings to various deities (Negrin 1975:19-20; R Liffman, personal communication 1996). Such bowls are kept in the local or family god house. In terms of their size and material culture, Huichol god houses and community temples (Myerhoff 1974:108-110) show a remarkable resemblance to Early and Late Ci?nega phase "Big Houses" (Halbirt et al. 1993:87, 90). Based on those similarities, Heidke and Ferg (1997a) suggested that incipi ent plain wares may have been used like the Huichol prayer-bowls as a me dium to convey prayers to the spirit world of ancestors and gods. As with many sets of alternative hypotheses, these two hypothesized functions of incipient plain wares need not be mutually exclusive. The recovery of sherds from five Early and Late Ci?nega phase sites sug gests that occupants of the Sonoran Desert experimented with ceramic con tainer technology for centuries before the production and use of utilitarian ceramic containers became an integral part of their adaptation to desert liv ing. However, the small number of incipient plain ware vessels recovered from each of these sites can be accounted for by the production of no more than one pot every generation. Ethnographic data suggest that ritual vessels have use lives that are much longer than those of utilitarian vessels (Vahen and Mills 1997:Table II). Therefore, it is not surprising to find evidence that sug gests a very low rate of ceramic production took place during the Early and Late Ci?nega phase occupations of these sites. Episode 2: The "Container Revolution" in the North American Southwest The Sonoran Desert Although the specific uses to which the earliest pottery was put cannot be discerned, ritual rather than secular motivations seem to underlie the incep tion of the technology. Following the Late Ci?nega phase, a utilitarian ceramic container technology was adopted in theTucson Basin during the Agua Caliente phase (ca. A.D. 150-550). The change in ceramic container function that oc curred at that time is doubtless related to the widespread adoption of utilitar ian ceramics throughout northwestern Mexico between ca. A.D. 1 and A.D. 300/400 (Foster 1995:202).The change in function is also reflected by a de cline in the volume of house floor storage pits between the Late Ci?nega phase and the Agua Caliente phase (Mabry 1997a). The earliest utilitarian ceramic containers recovered throughout the North American Southwest display technological sophistication and uniformity over a broad area, rather than local variability, suggesting that ceramic container technology did not develop independently throughout the region. Commonly, these early utilitarian ceramics share many characteristics, including: the use</page><page sequence="11">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.., 75 of self-tempered clays or locally procured sand tempers; a restricted number of vessel forms, the most common being the seed jar; and hand smoothing or light tool polishing of surfaces. As Hoopes (1994:5) has noted, it is when the earliest, contemporary ceramic complexes in a region show a high degree of heterogeneity that hypotheses for independent invention may prove to be the more parsimonious explanation. In the absence of long-distance transport, ideas about technology, form, and decoration move more rapidly across the landscape than do the objects themselves (Hoopes 1994:5). A cultural con tinuum, extending from Mesoamerica through the North American Southwest, has been posited on the basis of linguistic evidence and the distribution of material culture traits (Wilcox 1986). This "Tepiman connection" would have fostered very rapid diffusion of ideas regarding the manufacture and use of utilitarian ceramics. Therefore, like Woodbury and Zubrow (1979:53) before us, we infer that early potters residing throughout this vast region interacted with one another through small-scale trade between villages and social and ceremonial activities. Comparative analyses of ceramics from northern Mexico may suggest av enues of interaction and, perhaps, movement between Mesoamerica's north ern periphery and the North American Southwest. Technology transfer might have concerned a wide range of technical knowledge about ceramic manu facture and agriculture. Basic archaeological research is needed south of the current international border in order to understand the geographic origins of the utilitarian ceramic technology adopted throughout the North American Southwest during the first centuries A.D. (Stark 1995:267). Questions of ce ramic innovation, dependent invention, and diffusion cannot be adequately addressed until well-dated contexts have been excavated in the broad area encompassed by the proposed "Tepiman" corridor, especially in the 775-km zone from Durango to the international border (Wilcox 1986:145). Agua Caliente phase pottery has been recovered from El Arbolito (B. Huckell 1987a, 1987b), Houghton Road (Whittlesey 1995a), and the Square Hearth and Stone Pipe sites (Heidke et al. 1997), all in the Tucson Basin of South eastern Arizona. People living in other parts of the Sonoran Desert also be gan manufacturing utilitarian pottery at this time. In the Phoenix Basin, Red Mountain phase pottery has been recovered from Pueblo Patricio (Cable and Doyel 1985), La Cuenca del Sedimento (Kisselburg 1989), and Heritage Square (Henderson 1995). To the north of the Phoenix Basin, early utilitarian pottery has been recovered from the New River-Stricklin site (Kenny 1987), and to the east of the Phoenix Basin from La Escuela Cuba (Henderson 1992) and Eagle Ridge (Stark 1995). Temper composition and texture data indicate that Agua Caliente pha se potters followed two different materials procurement strategies. One of these stra tegies involved a single production step (cf. Feinman et al. 1981): the procurement of "self-tempered" alluvial clays. The other strategy involved three</page><page sequence="12">76 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 production steps: the procurement of untempered clay, the procurement of sand temper, and the combination of these two resources into a workable body. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the simpler, expedient strategy may have preceded the more complex and labor-intensive one (Heidke et al. 1997). The deliberate addition of temper may reflect attempts by potters to gain more refined control over the working properties of their clays and the physical attributes of their finished vessels. Simple vessel shapes were produced by coiling, pinching, hand smooth ing, smearing, scraping, and polishing (B. Huckell 1987a:335; Whittlesey 1995b). Although five bowl vessel forms and three jar vessel forms have been documented, the dominant vessel form of Agua Caliente phase plain wares is the neckless"seed jar." These seed jars are much larger than those produced earlier, with an average aperture diameter of 14.3 cm. Vessel walls are char acteristically thin, although variability related to production source has been noted: plain wares produced from self-tempered clay have thinner vessel walls than those produced from clay and sand mixtures (Heidke et al. 1997). Rice (1987:227) states that vessel wall thickness is related to the size of the pot, its intended use, and properties of the clay used in its manufacture. Vessel walls have to be strong enough to support the pot during forming and drying. But thinner walls reduce the risk of thermal shock during firing and use with heat, due to their lower thermal gradients (Rye 1981:98; Rice 1987:229, 365). The typically thin vessel walls of Agua Caliente phase pottery may represent the minimum thickness required to support the unfired weight of these relati vely small containers while, at the same time, ensuring consistently success ful firing outcomes. The Mogoll?n Highlands and Colorado Plateau Like the inhabitants of the southern deserts, the native peoples of the north ern highlands had a long tradition of working with clay that went back to the Early Archaic. At Cowboy and Walters caves in southeastern Utah, unfired clay figurines and small thimble-like objects were recovered from strata da ted to between 5600 to 5000 B.C. (Coulam and Schroedl 1996).The figurines bear a striking resemblance to images characteristic of the Barrier Canyon rock art style (Schaafsma 1971) of the northern Colorado Plateau and indi cate a possible ritual and symbolic connection between early clay artifacts and rock art, similar to that suggested by early incised pottery and ceramic figurines in the south. Crude unfired clay bowls have been recovered from both Early and Late Basketmaker (ca. A.D. 200-700) cave sites along the San Juan drainage in northeastern Arizona and southern Utah (Amsden 1949; Guernsey 1931; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; E.H. Morris 1927; E.A. Morris 1980; Nusbaum, Kidder, and Guernsey 1922). Similar vessels also have been reported by</page><page sequence="13">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery... 77 Martin et al. (1952) from both preceramic and ceramic levels atTularosa Cave in the upper Gila River drainage in the Mogoll?n region. These bowls were formed by mixing clay with a fiber binder, usually shredded juniper bark, and molding it into an open basket. The rims of the bowls were often built up by adding several thick coils of clay above the edge of the basketry mold, and lug handles were occasionally attached to the exterior. Many of the bowls show direct evidence of use in the form of a greasy organic residue on their interior. They were clearly made to be used as vessels in their own right and not simply as clay basket liners. Although there are no good dates for the earliest appearance of these unf ired clay bowls, several have been found in stratigraphie contexts that clearly indicate that their initial manufacture pre-dated the introduction of true ce ramic containers to the northern Southwest. However, the frequency of unfired, fiber-tempered clay bowl fragments dramatically increases in contexts that date after the introduction of true pottery in the Mogoll?n and Anasazi regions (Amsden 1949:117-119; Martin et al. 1952:70-71 ; E.A. Morris 1980: 65). As Martin et al. (1952) have suggested, such a pattern of co-production indi cates that unfired clay bowls were not precursors to the independent develop ment of pottery in the north. Rather they represent a separate, but technically related indigenous container technology that was eventually replaced by the introduction of true pottery from outside the highlands. However, E.H. Morris (1927:147) describes unfired bowl fragments from Canyon del Muerto in north eastern Arizona that lack the typical fiber binder and that were made from the same sandy alluvial clays that characterize the earliest brown ware ceramics. In addition, the practice of molding bowls in baskets remained a common feature of the Anasazi pottery tradition well into the thirteenth century A.D. {e.g. Habicht-Mauche 1993:22-23), suggesting at least some merging of these two independent container technologies in the north. The noted increase in the frequency of unfired vessels during the Early Ceramic period (ca. A.D. 200-550) suggests that the introduction of pottery to the Mogoll?n Rim and Colorado Plateau may have been precipitated, in part, by an increased demand for containers to fulfill a variety of new social and domestic functions (Brown 1989). Unfired clay bowls are extremely fragile and not well suited to the daily rigors of domestic food processing, cooking, or even serving. Nor is the open bowl form practical for extended storage. It is far more likely that these unfired vessels were used only for the presentation or consumption of foods in specific social or ritual contexts, paralleling the lim ited and specialized use of the earliest ceramic containers from the Sonoran Desert. Thus, new tasks would have required new technologies. The highlands, rather than its local development, include the fact that all of the earliest known specimens of true pottery from the Mogoll?n and Anasazi regions represent a considerable jump in technological sophistication com pared with their unfired clay counterparts (Martin et al. 1952:73). In addition,</page><page sequence="14">78 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 as noted above, the striking similarities of technology, form, and style that characterize the earliest pottery from throughout the North American South west and northwestern Mexico suggest that these wares form a single techno logical tradition and share a common origin (Heidke and Stark 1997; Wilson and Blinman 1993). However, the introduction of ceramic technology to the northern highlands of the Southwest may have been facilitated by the pres ence of an existing clay container tradition. The dating of the introduction of pottery to the Mogoll?n Highlands and Colorado Plateau is somewhat unclear. Wills (1996:353) reports that calibrated radiocarbon dates from the Mogoll?n Highlands and adjacent valleys suggest an Early Ceramic period occupation of the region beginning in the third cen tury A.D. However, he points out that charcoal dates from large pieces of wood, such as structural timbers, may overestimate the actual cultural age of these sites by as much as 200 years. The Bluff Site in the Forestdale Valley of eastern Arizona has yielded several tree ring dates in the A.D. 300s, includ ing a bark date of A.D. 318 from one pithouse (Haury and Sayles 1947), making the pottery from this site the earliest yet identified from the northern Southwest.The earliest cutting dates from ceramic period sites in the Mogoll?n Highlands proper are A.D. 460 from the SU site and A.D. 462 from LA5407, with non-cutting dates clustering between A.D. 450-517 (Wills 1996:353).The earliest structural tree ring dates associated with pottery from the Colorado Plateau also date to the end of the fifth century A.D. (Breternitz 1986).Thus, a careful re-examination of the existing evidence indicates that pottery making may have been adopted in the Mogoll?n Highlands and Colorado Plateau much later than is generally suggested (e.g. Blinman 1993; Crown and Wills 1995; LeBlanc 1982a; Morris 1980) and that its spread into these highland regions of the Southwest lagged significantly behind its initial development in the desert lowlands of southeastern Arizona. Crown and Wills (1995:178) have suggested that climatic factors may have created scheduling conflicts that discouraged the earlier adoption of pottery making in the northern highlands. In particular, the cold, harsh winters char acteristic of the Mogoll?n Highlands and Colorado Plateau would have limited pottery production to the milder and drier seasons of the year, particularly the late summer and fall. It was precisely during this time of year, however, that the early horticulturalists of the highlands would have been the least sed entary and the most involved in a wide variety of subsistence activities, mak ing it difficult for them to engage in sustained periods of craft production. The milder winters and early development of long-term sedentism in the Sonoran Desert would have created fewer logistical impediments to these technologi cal developments. Thus, the development and spread of pottery container technology in the Southwest appears to have been strongly linked to the emer gence of local settlement and subsistence systems characterized by grea</page><page sequence="15">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 79 ter residential stability and an increased dependence on stored agricultural resources. Early pottery from the Mogoll?n Rim and Colorado Plateau shares a num ber of traits in common with Red Mountain/Agua Caliente phase ceramics from the Sonoran Desert. These traits include the use of brown firing, sandy alluvial clays, a limited range of vessels forms, the most common being shal low bowls, neckless seed jars, and globular jars with straight or recurved rims, hand smoothing or light tool polishing of surfaces, and the occasional addi tion of a fugitive red (hematite) surface coating. Important collections of early Alma series pottery from the Mogoll?n Highlands are discussed by Haury (1936), Haury and Sayles (1947), Martin (1940; 1943; Martin and Rinaldo 1947; Martin et al. 1949; Martin et al. 1952), Rinaldo (1940), Sayles (1945), and Wheat (1955). Adamana Brown pottery from the Petrified Forest area of the Colorado Plateau is discussed by Mera (1934), Wendorf (1953:51-55), and Burton (1991), and from the upper Puerco River region in Blinman and Wilson (1994). Similar early brown wares from the Navajo Reservoir district are described by Eddy (1966) and Wilson (1989), while Wilson and Blinman (1993) present a current summary of early ceramics from the Four Corners area. Varien (1986) briefly discusses recent finds of early pottery from the Zuni area. The Production and Use of Early Utilitarian Ceramic Containers Crown and Wills (1995:245) and Wilson et al. (1992:13-14) have argued that the paste formulations, simple profiles, and thin vessel walls that charac terize the earliest utilitarian pottery from throughout the North American South west are all features that are most appropriate for vessels used for cooking over an open fire. Although these are desirable characteristics in a cooking pot (Sassaman 1995; Skibo and Schiffer 1995), we argue here, following Heidke et al. (1997) and Heidke and Stark (1997), that similar features also may result from the use of expedient manufacturing techniques associated with extremely low rates of manufacture. Technical similarities between the earli est brown ware pots and later Southwestern cooking vessels may reflect a common solution to the problems associated with thermal stress reduction, rather than a common function. As Rice (1987:363) notes, "The thermal be havior of a ceramic is of concern in two situations: in the initial firing of the clay and in use of the fired vessel with heat." Thus, such physical attributes do not indicate, in and of themselves, that cooking was the primary function of these early utilitarian vessels. In terms of vessel forms, proportions, and sizes, these early brown ware assemblages are quite distinct from later ceramic collections in the South west. In the Sonoran Desert, the predominant vessel form recovered from Red Mountain/Agua Caliente phase sites is the seed jar. In the northern high</page><page sequence="16">80 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 lands, small necked jars with restricted orifices are also common. Open forms, such as bowls and elongated jars with out-curved rims, also have been re ported from Early Ceramic period sites, but are relatively rare in comparison to the more common closed forms. Thus, overall, these early assemblages can be characterized as being dominated by vessels that are relatively small in size, squat in proportion, with generally small, closed or restricted open ings. Comparisons of these formal attributes with the proportions of ethno graphic vessels of known function suggest that these forms are not consistent with those that generally characterize Southwestern cooking vessels and are much more suitable for storage (Heidke and Stark 1997).The recovery of jar covers and vessels with abrasion at their lips provides additional lines of evi dence indicating that storage was the function for which the majority of the early brown ware ceramics in the Southwest were designed. We propose that the primary use of these small jars was dry storage of the "best of seed" (Schoenwetter 1978:20 in Weaver et al. 1978) for planting the next year's crop, keeping in mind that the "best" seed may be judged using religious/ritual crite ria (Bohrer 1994:483, 507-509). Some unrestricted jars and open bowls, in the northern Southwest, may have been used for direct heat cooking and food serving during this early period, but the use of ceramics to perform these domestic tasks appears to have been fairly limited prior to A.D. 500. Estimating the annual output of these early Southwestern potters suggests why we believe they employed an expedient ceramic technology. Examples of primary household refuge are extremely rare at Early Ceramic period sites. In the Tucson Basin, the Stone Pipe site is the only one to have been excavated that has produced de facto refuse pottery assemblages. Six Agua Caliente phase features at that site had floor assemblages that contained from one to six vessels.The least disturbed of those features had burned catastrophically (Swartz and Lindeman 1997), and five vessels were recovered from its floor. Small household assemblages appear to be the norm at contemporary sites located outside of the Tucson Basin, too. The Eagle Ridge site, located in the Tonto Basin, was occupied between A.D. 100 and 600 (Elson and Lindeman 1994:106). Two Early Ceramic period features with floor assemblages were excavated there; one contained three vessels and the other contained two vessels (Elson and Lindeman 1994).The contemporary SU site is located in the Mogoll?n Highlands of western New Mexico. The Pine Lawn phase fea tures with floor assemblages there contained from one to four vessels (Wills 1996:Table 3). The contemporary site of Sivu'ovi is located on the Colorado Plateau of northeastern Arizona. Four vessels were recovered from a subfloor storage pit in one structure, and one vessel was recovered from a bell-shaped pit in another structure (Burton 1991:50). All of these examples suggest that the "typical" Early Ceramic period household may have contained between 1 to 5 ceramic containers at any one time.</page><page sequence="17">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 81 Evidence presented in Heidke et al. (1997) indicates that, on average, the pottery assemblage from a typical Agua Caliente phase household in theTuc son Basin would have required replacement every five years. Given the simi larity in household assemblages noted above, this figure probably represents a reasonable estimate of ceramic container use life throughout the Southwest during the Early Ceramic period. If each household manufactured most of the pottery it required for its own use, then the manufacture of just one or two vessels each year would have met this need, since the typical household assemblage contained only five pots and those vessels would have lasted approximately five years. If production rates were that low, then a simple, or expedient, technique may have had the dual advantages of being relatively easy to remember (from year to year) and likely to yield a consistently suc cessful outcome. This situation resembles one described by Balfet (1965) in North Africa. She notes that all of the potter's attention and technical knowl edge "...is mobilized in this effort to reconstitute the chain of traditional steps, the single, brief use of which, once a year, ensures their perpetuation and transmission from one generation to another" (Balfet 1965:169-170). While the techniques these early Southwestern potters employed to manu facture the region's first utilitarian pottery may be characterized as simple and expedient, they represent an elegant solution to household requirements for just one or two new storage vessels each year. Labor requirements were minimized by selecting self-tempered clays and limiting the effort expended in finishing surfaces, while the likelihood of achieving successful firings under variable conditions was increased by constructing vessels with simple con tours and relatively thin walls. In contrast, the techniques employed by later Southwestern potters were less efficient and much more labor-intensive. Clays and tempers were collected separately, processed, and then mixed, more labor was expended on the finish of interior and exterior surfaces, and greater control was exercised over the nature and consistency of firing atmospheres. Episode 3: The Emergence of Regional Ceramic Traditions The production of these simple, brown, pottery containers remained highly uniform across the highland and lowland regions of the North American South west until ca. A.D. 500/550. After that time-clear technological and stylistic differences emerged that mark the major regional ceramic traditions of the Southwest. Most striking is the introduction of painted decoration and other elaborate surface treatments, including slipping, smudging, and texturing. Painted decorations were most prominently applied to the interior surface of shallow, hemispherical bowls (in the Mogoll?n and Anasazi areas) and flare rim bowls (in the Hohokam area), suggesting that displays of symbolic infor mation and cultural identity may have taken on greater significance within</page><page sequence="18">82 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 social and ritual contexts involving the public presentation and consumption of food. The most important technological advance of the period involved the development of well-engineered cooking pots, which assume a more promi nent place in most ceramic assemblages at this time. Improvements in ce ramic cooking technology also may have been linked to the growing importance of feasting and food sharing as contexts for constituting social relationships and identity within sedentary agricultural communities. The Sonoran Desert Potters began to produce red wares as well as plain wares by the Phoenix Basin's Vahki phase and theTucson Basin's Tortolita phase (ca. A.D. 550-650/ 700). Adams (1996) has suggested that the introduction of the floury Maiz de Ocho at about this time stimulated technological changes that led to the de velopment of the trough metate and longer manos, both of which were specialized for efficient flour production. The increased diversity of ceramic vessel forms that also occurs at this time indicates that pottery containers finally began to fulfill a full range of food preparation, cooking, serving, and storage functions (Heidke 1990; 1991 ; 1993; 1996). Heidke and Stark (1997) have suggested that the appearance of red-slipped vessels at this time may have denoted the relationship between new (ceramic) food processing technologies and the life-giving quality of the foods cooked and served in them. In addition, the distinctive flare-rim bowl, a signature vessel form of the Hohokam, first appears in Tortolita phase deposits. A series of short-lived red-on-gray, red-on-brown, and red-on-buff ceramic types mark the period from A.D. 650-750 (Wallace et al. 1995: Figure 2). The simple geometric layouts and parallel lines painted on these early decorated wares are derived from imagery found in the Western Archaic rock art tradi tion (Wallace 1995:34; Wallace et al. 1995:600). However, by ca. A.D. 750 800 the Hohokam regional system had emerged throughout the Sonoran Desert region (Wilcox 1979; 1980). Large-scale canal irrigation was wide spread in the Phoenix Basin, and new architectural forms, an elaborate mor tuary ritual, and ballcourts were in place. A radical departure from the preceding Archaic iconography accompanied those changes. The new style incorpo rated life forms, and it can be identified on ceramics, shell jewelry, ground stone, and rock art (Wallace 1995:34). Common themes include dancing scenes, scenes of ritual regalia, childbirth, copulation, and hunting; anthropo morphic figures are sometimes shown with elaborate headdresses, staffs, bows-and-arrows, and tumpline burden baskets (Wallace 1995: 36-37). The shared ideology implied by the Hohokam regional system, and its expression in pottery, marks the emergence of one of the major regional ceramic tradi tions of the Southwest.</page><page sequence="19">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 83 The Mogoll?n Highlands and Adjacent Valleys Several innovations in ceramic production and style characterized the period between A.D. 550 and 700 in the northern mountains and southern foothills and deserts that border the Mogoll?n Rim. These changes include the devel opment of smudging, texturing by incising, scoring, or brushing, neck-band ing, and the addition of polished red slips. Several of these traits, particularly neck-banding and texturing, were very limited in their production and distribu tion, suggesting the emergence of more highly localized pottery traditions in the Mogoll?n area during this period. In contrast, highly polished, red-slipped pottery (San Francisco Red) is found widely distributed throughout the Mogoll?n region on sites dating to between A.D. 550 and A.D. 1000. Its most common forms are bowls and seed jars and the exterior of bowls is often finger dimpled. To what degree these polished red wares were traded among the Mogoll?n, as opposed to each local group developing its own variant, is unknown (LeBlanc 1982b:111).This combination of smudged, textured, and polished, red-slipped brown wares characterized the northern Mogoll?n CeramicTradi tion well into the twelfth century. In the foothills and deserts south of the Mogoll?n rim, a painted ceramic tradition also developed that is best known from the Mimbres area in New Mexico.The earliest painted pottery from this area, poorly dated to about A.D. 650, consisted of brown slipped bowls with simple red linear designs on their interiors. Designs are similar over the entire southern Mogoll?n area and show marked similarity to early Pioneer period Hohokam designs. Somewhat later, around A.D. 750, white slips replaced brown, to create a more striking red-on white color scheme.This color scheme was apparently very short-lived, how ever, with black pigments replacing red in the Mimbres area by the end of the eighth century, while red-on-brown painted pottery continued to be produced in northern Chihuahua and in the San Simon area. Bowls are the most com mon painted forms, although painted jars increase in frequency through time. Design elements become increasingly complex with the introduction of hatch ing, cross-hatching and checkerboard fillers. As in the Anasazi and Hohokam area, the greater elaboration of decorated ceramics after A.D. 700 may reflect the integration of ceramic vessels, especially painted and smudged bowls, within social and ritual contexts where symbolic expressions of identity and information exchange were increasingly important. The Colorado Plateau One of the most distinctive features of Anasazi pottery is the characteristic predominance of gray-colored pastes.The transition from brown ware to gray ware technology took place between ca. A.D. 550 and 600 throughout the Four Corners region of the northern Southwest (Blinman 1993). This change</page><page sequence="20">84 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 resulted from a shift in raw material procurement strategies, as potters switched from sandy, alluvial clays to the more abundant Cretaceous clays common to the sandstone formations of the Colorado Plateau (Shepard 1953). Replica tion experiments have shown that these geologic clays are somewhat more difficult to work with, requiring the addition of crushed rock or sherd temper to reduce excessive shrinkage. They also seem to perform best when fired in a neutral, as opposed to an oxidizing, atmosphere (Blinman 1993). On the other hand, they can be fired longer, at higher temperatures, producing harder, well sintered pastes. In addition, the light gray color achieved in neutral firings provided a more suitable background for the addition of painted decorations. Blinman (1993:15) has argued that "the foundation of the Anasazi ceramic tradition was the cooking pot." As he points out, these deceptively simple vessels embodied a delicately engineered compromise between conflicting technological and functional demands (Blinman 1993:16). Attributes such as form, size, wall thickness, and paste texture were manipulated to produce durable vessels that could withstand the daily stresses of direct heat cooking. The basic design of the Anasazi cooking pot was perfected during the sev enth century A.D. and thereafter came to dominate ceramic assemblages from domestic contexts all across the Colorado Plateau. At about the same time that potters in the Four Corners area began experi menting with the lighter firing Cretaceous clays, they also began adding simple painted designs in black pigments to a small number of vessels, usually bowls. The earliest painted designs on Anasazi pottery appear to mimic simple, asym metric basketry designs. Figurai and representational scenes, highly reminis cent of contemporaneous rock art designs, are rare and generally limited to this early period of ceramic painting. Later Anasazi designs are strongly geo metrical, characterized by a bold contrast between black paint and light (white slipped) ground. Painting is often constrained within well-defined decorative bands along the interior side walls of bowls or exterior upper body/shoulder of jars, although all-over design motifs are also common in certain areas, at certain times. Broad technological and decorative trends clearly link the white wares of the Colorado Plateau into a single technological and decorative tra dition; however, a variety of locally distinct white ware styles began to be produced throughout the Anasazi area after A.D. 700. Early potters on the Plateau occasionally dusted the outside of ceramic vessels with an impermanent "fugitive red" coating of powdered hematite. A few pots with red clay slips have been recovered from sites in the Four Cor ners area dating to the end of the seventh century, paralleling the develop ment of polished red wares in the Hohokam and Mogoll?n regions. Around A.D. 750, potters in southeastern Utah began adding painted decorations, first in a deeper red and later in black pigments to the surface of these red ware vessels. Always more limited in their production, both geographically and in terms of household specialization, red wares at certain times were</page><page sequence="21">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 85 distributed widely across the Four Corners area and appear to have played a significant role in regional social and economic networks throughout the north ern Southwest (Hegmon et al. 1995). Discussion Brown (1989) has argued that any analysis of the early adoption and spread of pottery technology must deal with two critical issues. The first is that the earliest pottery, in most parts of the world, was very simple and underdevel oped technologically, and second, that the development and spread of this technology was often very slow and sporadic. The evidence presented here demonstrates that such a pattern characterized the first occurrences and early spread of pottery throughout the North American Southwest. As Brown points out, these archaeological "facts" tend to undermine standard adaptationist theories of ceramic origins, since if pottery was invented to solve some spe cific problem, such as the need to boil cereal grains to make them palatable, then why didn't technologically sophisticated pottery develop quickly and spread rapidly in response to this need? Instead, Brown (1989) argues that we must look at technological innovations, such as the development and spread of pottery technology, from the perspective of economic decision theory, fo cusing attention on changing contexts of production and consumption.Thus, the reasons for the initial development of ceramic container technology within an area may be very different from those which fostered its widespread adop tion and use within a broad spectrum of domestic and social contexts. Brown (1989:220-221 ) lists a number of expectations that derive from his analysis of the beginnings of pottery making as an economic process. First, there should be an experimental period of pottery production that could last for several centuries. Second, expedient manufacturing techniques should appear in the earliest phases of pottery production. And third, early periods should contain evidence of alternative technologies that decline in frequency after pottery use takes hold. The evidence reviewed in this article clearly confirms that the first expec tation was met in the case of the earliest pottery from the North American Southwest. As we have shown, a low frequency of what might be termed "experimental" ceramics have been recovered from numerous Early and Late Ci?nega phase sites in the Tucson Basin region of the Sonoran Desert in Southeast Arizona. These small, simple "incipient plain ware" vessels were produced for centuries before more technologically refined ceramic storage containers were developed. The small bowls that make up the majority of incipient plain ware vessels are well suited to the task of serving individual portions of liquid or holding offerings.Their low numbers, small size and primi tive technology, however, make it seem unlikely that they were of much gen eral use in domestic contexts or that they played a significant role in the</page><page sequence="22">86 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 preparation and serving of foods for competitive feasts, although they may have developed as an important component in integrative, community-based rituals. Thus, while we do not view these early ceramic containers as "pres tige goods," in the status-seeking sense that Hayden (1995) uses the term, we do agree with him that new mediums, like pottery, may develop because their labor-intensive production and technological novelty imbue them with a certain "value" and "power" that makes them particularly evocative and effica cious in certain social and ritual settings. As Hayden (1995:262) also points out, technological advances that increase efficiency of production may encourage the development of broader and more practical uses of these emerging technologies. This observation supports Brown's (1989) second expectation that the early phases of pottery produc tion should be characterized by expedient manufacturing techniques. In the Sonoran Desert region of Southeastern Arizona, a change in the relative fre quency of "seed jars," from an average of 15 percent during the earliest ceramic phases (ca. 800 B.C.-A.D. 150) to 83 percent after A.D. 150, appears to reflect just such a transition. It was at this time that pottery began to play a more significant role as domestic storage containers within increasingly teth ered, horticulturally-based households, and it was within this context that ce ramic technology spread to the highland areas of the northern Southwest. Evidence of resource selection, vessel shape, vessel wall thickness, and ce ramic flow rate all point to the practice of expedient manufacturing techniques during the A.D. 150-500 time span. All of these techniques are well suited to the casual, low-intensity replacement of small household assemblages of lim ited functional diversity. The pots themselves cannot provide the evidence necessary for assess ing the third expectation of Brown's (1989:221) economic model; that evi dence of alternative container technologies should decline in frequency after pottery becomes well-established. Of course, the relative importance of bas kets and other containers made of perishable materials is difficult to assess. A decline in the volume of house floor storage pits between the Late Ci?nega phase and the Agua Caliente phase in theTucson Basin of Southeast Arizona may be interpreted as evidence of a decline in one type of alternative con tainer technology. However, in both the Colorado Plateau and Mogoll?n High lands, the earliest ceramic period settlements show a dramatic increase in the number and size of storage pits (Crown and Wills 1995:245). In addi tion, the production of unfired fiber-tempered bowls in the Anasazi and Mogoll?n areas also appears to increase in association with the development and spread of the earliest brown ware pottery. Taken together, all of this evi dence suggests that, although pottery technology spread widely in response to an increasing need for storage containers throughout the North American Southwest during the early centuries of the Christian era, ceramic production did not substantially displace other alternative container technologies until ca. A.D. 500.</page><page sequence="23">The First Occurrences and Early Distribution of Pottery.. 87 One important implication of our overview of known early ceramic period household assemblages is the apparently low number of vessels requiring replacement each year. This observation is important because it calls into question certain aspects of Crown and Wills' (1995) time-budgeting analysis of the emergence of Southwestern ceramic container technology. Their model hinges on two points: establishing that pottery manufacture represents an advantageous "economy of scale" relative to the manufacture of bags, bas kets, and storage pits (Crown and Wills 1995:245-246), and proving that Brown's (1989:216) argument regarding the"negligible costs" of this new tech nology does not apply to cases from the North American Southwest (Crown and Wills 1995:246-248). Their discussion of economy of scale makes it clear that they assume a much higher annual ceramic production rate than seems to be supported by the current evidence; an assumption that may re late to their belief that many of the earliest brown ware pots were used for cooking. They review evidence for the division of labor in societies that practice a mixed horticultural and foraging economy and produce pottery, and conclude that adding pottery manufacture to a woman's workload of gathering, hoe farming, and food preparation created scheduling problems that conflicted with these other activities. Crown and Wills (1995:249) "...do not believe that the production and use of the first pottery fit easily into the odd bits of time that prehistoric women had." However, the archaeological evidence presented here demonstrates that the labor requirement to produce, on average, one or two pots every year is not likely to have been overly burdensome. Even if the annual production rate estimate is incorrect by an order of magnitude, the burdens of pottery production and its associated food processing tech niques envisioned by Crown and Wills (1995) were not likely present during what we have defined as the second episode of ceramic innovation in the North American Southwest, between A.D. 150-500. Expediency, rather than economy of scale, characterized this phase. The widespread development and use of ceramic storage containers in both the lowland and highland regions of the Southwest represented another step in transition to sedentism and increased dependence on cultigens that had begun during the Late Archaic, but the intensity of pottery production and its overall importance within household economies remained very limited. However, Crown and Wills' (1995) model of economic intensification and its effect on women's labor may explain why the intensity of pottery produc tion and use in the North American Southwest remained so low for so long. It was not until the technological and social benefits of ceramic production and use outweighed its cost in time-budgeting and scheduling conflicts, espe cially for women, that pottery became fully incorporated into the full range of Southwestern economic and social contexts, at both the household and com munity level. Our review of the archaeological literature suggests that this did</page><page sequence="24">88 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 14 not happen in either the southern lowlands or northern highlands until well into the sixth century A.D. In particular, the current evidence from theTucson Basin, in southeastern Arizona, indicates that it took somewhere between 950-1,450 years before people became completely dependent on pottery for a wide range of food processing functions and social display activities. The development of ceramic forms and pastes specifically designed for direct heat cooking allowed grains and other foods to be processed more efficiently and enhanced their nutritional value by making them more digest ible. The latter benefit may have encouraged early weaning as one means of accommodating conflicts between women's subsistence and child rearing ac tivities in the context of sedentary, tethered households (Crown and Wills 1995:249). Cooking pots also facilitate the preparation of large quantities of food with a minimum of direct attention.This factor may have been important to the development of increased food sharing and feasting; contexts critical to defining social identities and relations of power within communities and to building alliances within and between groups. The proliferation and elabo ration of painting and surface decoration on pottery also may be linked to an increased emphasis on processes of identity formation, boundary mainte nance, and alliance formation throughout the North American Southwest dur ing the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. Thus, the early occurrence and spread of pottery technology in the North American Southwest can be seen to have been part of a long and complex process that spanned more than a millennium. Current evidence suggests that pottery technology may have first developed in this region as part of integrative ritual displays associated with the earliest agricultural settlements in the southern lowlands of the Sonoran Desert. A more utilitarian ceramic container technology developed and spread widely throughout the Southwest during the early centuries A.D., probably in conjunction with a growing overall demand for storage facilities, but time budgeting and scheduling constraints probably limited the intensity of its production and use. It is only after A.D. 500 that we see the full technological and social potential of ceramic containers being exploited by the native peoples of the North American Southwest. This pattern suggests that we can not conceive of the "origins of pottery" in this area as a unitary "event" of either diffusion or independent invention, but rather we must endeavor to explain this process in terms of a series of distinct episodes of technological innovation and development played out within the context of continually changing economic, social and historical circumstances.
