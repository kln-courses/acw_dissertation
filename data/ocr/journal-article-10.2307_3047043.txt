<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES GANDHARA AND EARLY CHRISTIAN ART: THE HOMME-ARCADE AND THE DATE OF THE BIMARAN RELIQUARY BENJAMIN ROWLAND, JR. Many of the early writers on the school of Late Antique sculp- ture in northwestern India and Afghanistan, called either Graeco-Buddhist or Gandhara art, have briefly alluded to the resemblances between this easternmost extension of the Roman Imperial style and the forms and techniques of Early Christian art.1 None of the scholars who have examined the possibility of such a relationship - with the exception of Vincent Smith who at least cited a great many parallels between Early Christian art and Graeco-Roman art in India - has done more than men- tion the general resemblance between certain types that occur on the reliefs of Gandhara and the sarcophagi of Christian Rome.2 The re-examination of this question could not be de- scribed as whipping a dead horse, for on no occasion has it been studied with the end of reaching a really creative conclusion on the significance of these similarities. The importance of such comparison lies in the light it sheds on the controversial date of the Gandhara school and also on the mechanism governing the diffusion of concepts and art forms in the Late Antique world. Some of these similarities are simply what one would expect in the synthetic and almost world-wide creation that was Late Antique art in the early centuries of the Christian era; others, as suggested above, are of such significance as to warrant a more thorough analysis than has been given them. One of the closest Indian parallels to art forms in the Late Antique world is afforded by the famous golden reliquary of BTmaran (Fig. I), first brought to light by the romantic pio- neer in Indian archaeology, Charles Masson, just one hundred years ago.3 In a recent article on the Bimaran reliquary Reginald Le May has sought to demonstrate that this famous casket is no later than the late first or early second century A.D.4 Among the evidence brought forward to support this claim is the fact that when this object was excavated in one of the stupas near JelalIbad, there were found a number of coins of the ruler Azes II who reigned in the first half of the first century A.D.5 It is the present writer's contention that this numismatic testi- mony does not demonstrate either that the reliquary was made before or after the minting of the moneys found with it: it is a well known fact that coins continued in circulation in India sometimes centuries after they had been struck, and therefore the coppers of King Azes may well have been deposited for any number of reasons long after their original date of issue.6 Le May, basing his judgment on an enlargement of the small and very inadequate engraving in Wilson's book, comes to the con- clusion that the masonry of the stupa in which the relic box was found belongs to a type assigned by Sir John Marshall to the Scytho-Parthian period of the first century A.D.' This type of construction, called rubble masonry by Marshall, may be seen in the Dharmarajika stupa and the buildings at Sirkap in Taxila. A comparison of Masson's drawing of Tope No. 2 at Bimaran with my photographs of the ruined stupa at Shevaki near Kabul reveals a striking similarity (Fig. 2). The photo- graphs clearly show that although the core of the Shevaki stupa is a mass of stones and earth closely resembling rubble, the ex- terior surface, consisting of large boulders set in very regularly disposed courses of small stones, resembles the coarse and mas- sive diaper pattern which Sir John Marshall has found to be typical of buildings of the second century A.D. at Taxila.8 The photograph of a detail of a stupa at Bimarin, the construction of which is the same as Masson's No. 2, again shows this identi- cal surfacing in large diaper masonry (Fig. 3). It seems clear to me that it is this type of construction, and not rubble, that Mas- son sought to illustrate. His sketch also reveals a conglomerate of stone and earth identical to that of the building at Shevaki. A further argument brought forth by Le May to date the BTmaran reliquary in the first century A.D. is the evidence of the Kharosthi inscription on the stone vase in which the golden box was originally found.' Since, as the writer himself admits, his authorities, Professors Konow and Thomas, disagree, their testimony certainly does not serve to bolster our confidence in the author's conclusions. Indeed, the parallels to Late Antique art which I intend to investigate in this article will serve to sup- port my original hypothesis that the Bimarin reliquary is much later than the date claimed for it by Le May and earlier writers.'? On the sides of the BTmaran reliquary, which suggests a pyxis in form, is chased a double series of four figures, some walking, others standing in attitudes of adoration, and each one framed in the arch of an arcade that girdles the casket (Fig. 4). In the niches to right and left of the image of Buddha are figures of Indra and Brahma turning toward him, just as on certain Early Christian sarcophagi the Apostles Peter and Paul reverently ap- proach Christ, although each placed - as He is - in his own compartment of the arcade (Fig. 5).11 Still another parallel to these Early Christian monuments is the placing of birds in the I.

This is not the place to discuss the evolution of the homme-arcade motif, ex- cept to say that it does not occur in Indian art prior to the Gandhara school and that this device of separating figures in niches as a sculptural concept is first evolved in the Asiatic sar- cophagus of Melfi, carved in Lydia about 170 A.D., and in the sarcophagi of Sidamara, dating from the second century A.D. and later: from this Eastern source there developed the fourth- century columnar sarcophagi of Christian art and, possibly, the equivalent of this form in northwestern India and Afghanis- tan.13 In the Bimardn casket and in the Early Christian sar- cophagi, the arcade is a continuous and flat succession of arches on columns with none of the projecting aediculae, broken en- tablatures, and exedrae that distinguish the earliest adaptation of the scenae frons to funerary furniture. This peristyle, with its union of columns and arches, suggests nothing so much as the fagade of the palace of Diocletian at Spalato. The Bimardn reli- quary is by no means the only parallel to this Early Christian type that Gandhara affords: on Stupa No. 56 at Bagh-gaY' (Fig. 6), near the more famous Afghan site of Hadda, and in one of the wall-paintings at Bamiydn, we again find the device of figures placed in the adjacent niches of an arcade, an ar- rangement that suggests even more strongly the Early Christian sarcophagi of the columnar type.14 These comparisons unques- tionably point to the dating of all the Gandhqra monuments in question in the third or fourth century A.D. at the very earliest. Regarding the possible independent evolution of the homme- arcade motif in Gandhara, it might be argued that as early as the first century B.c. in the Shrine of the Double-headed Eagle at Sirkap (Taxila) (Fig. 7), we have an architectural fagade treated with a blind arcade: in the niches formed by the en- gaged Corinthian pilasters are small reliefs of an Indian gate or torina, the entrance of a chaitya hall, and an elevation of a pedimented temple front.'" It needed only the substitution of Buddha images for these representations of' architecture to pro- duce the typical lZomme-arcade decoration as we see it in Af- ghanistan and at Taxila itself in the stucco ornamentation of the stupas of Jaulian.1" Such an evolution would represent, first of all, the expected transition from the primitive, aniconic form of Buddhism to the developed Mahayana in which images of the Master replaced the earlier symbols; secondly, this develop- ment could be said to follow the same cycle as that which is be- lieved to have produced the homme-arcade motif of Late An- tique art. There the placing of human figures in the inter- columnar spaces of a typical Hellenistic theater or portal fagade produced the characteristic form of the Sidamara sarcophagi and the Early Christian sarcophagi of the columnar type." Whether we are to conclude that the homme-arcade concept originated independently in India as suggested above, or that the rows of Buddhas separated by pilasters is a decorative scheme taken over from Early Christian art, is an extremely difficult and yet enormously important problem in the history of the art of the Late Antique world. A third, and, in the author's opinion, the most attractive, possibility is that the motif of figures in an arcade had a common source in the Near East and spread from there both to India and to the Late Classic and Early Christian world of the West." No evaluation of the aspect of the Gandhara-Early Chris- tian problem touching on the homme-arcade motif can over- look the curious pottery ossuaries which have been discovered in some numbers in Transoxiana (Tadj ikistan, Uzbekistan, Tabaristan) (Fig. 8). They are briefly discussed in an article by Strzygowski, and the single drawing published in this study of one of the ossuaries is at present the only material available on these objects.19 On the side of the coffin is an arcade formed by columns with exotic capitals, supporting round arches, with four niches each containing a figure in Sasanian dress. In the spandrels of the arches are three-pointed designs that look al- most like abstractions of the birds that fill the spaces in the same position on the Bimaran reliquary; a frieze of quatrefoil de- signs runs along above the arcade. The similarity of the whole arrangement to the sarcophagi of the pagan and Christian West and to the Gandharan versions of the figure-and-arcade con- cept, is immediately apparent. The style of the Tashkend sar- cophagus is most strongly suggestive of Sasanian art, particularly of Christ and the Apostles on a reliquary in the Hof Museum, Vienna. (See W. F. Volbach, Metallarbeiten des christlichen Kultes in der Spdtan- tike und im friihen Mittelalter [Kat. des Rom.-Germ. Central Museums, Nr. 9], Mainz, 1921, No. 11, Taf. v, and H. Swaboda, "Friihchristliche Reliquiarien des K. K. Miinzen und Antiken Cabinetts," Mitteilungen der K. K. Central Commission, Wien, xvi, 189o, Taf. I.) 12. The employment of these eagles in the spandrels may be seen in many examples in Roman architecture. Cf. Karl Lehmann, "The Dome of Heaven," THE ART BULLETIN, XXVII, 1945, p. 18, figs. 55-56. In these monuments it is likely that the eagles, the birds of Zeus, were used in con- junction with sky symbolism inherent in the dome they support. In the Bimardn reliquary it is unlikely that we are to see anything more than a decorative use of a once meaningful form. 13. Cf. C. R. Morey, Sardis, v, Princeton, 1924, pp. 90 ff., and idem, Early Christian Art, Princeton, 1942, pp. 24 ff.; see also Lawrence, op. cit., p. 164. The concept of figures in panels, as seen on the gates and rail- ings at Sdfici and Bharhut, which is the nearest Indian approach to such an arcade arrangement, has really nothing to do with a device that started in the Late Antique period as a group of related figures placed against an architectural background and ended by the figures being absorbed into that architectural background. No one would suggest that the arcade motif be- gan in India before its appearance in the Western world. The early de- velopment of the homme-arcade motif in Christian and Byzantine art is discussed by H. Focillon in his L'art des sculpteurs romans, Paris, 1931, pp. 63 ff. The homme-arcade represents, as it were, a new emphasis on the dramatis personae rather than the drama: figures isolated in architectural niches replace the earlier scenes of continuous dramatic action. The Sida- mfra sarcophagi seem almost certainly to reflect the arcaded fagades of buildings of the Greek East. Single figures enclosed in niches are known in Parthian art, but these again seem to be a later development out of the homme-arcade concept evolved in the Graeco-Roman world of the Near East. Cf.

No such substitution of anthropomorphic for aniconic symbols took place in the West owing to the unbroken continuity of the anthropomorphic tra- dition, a tradition that presumably only reached India with the introduc- tion of Graeco-Roman techniques. 17. See C. R. Morey, Mediaeval Art, New York, 1942, p. 34. In an article on "The Architectural Background in the Paintings at Dura- Europos," American Journal of Archaeology, XLV, I, Jan.-March, 1941, pp. 18 ff., Mr. Clark Hopkins also derives this concept from the scenae frons. I am unable to follow his argument that the Ajant5 wall-paintings show the influence of such Late Antique space concepts. I8. The fagade of the Sasanian palace at Ctesiphon comes as close to approximating the Graeco-Roman theater fagade as anything in the ori- ental world. There is no way of telling from the existing ruins whether or not the now empty niches were originally filled with statuary: the general enframement, however, is so close to what we see at Hadda and Taxila that it may well have been through Sasanian Iran that the homme-arcade, together with so many other borrowings from Late Antique art, found its way to Gandh5ra.

It seems scarcely necessary to point out that the presence of these pottery caskets in the Oxus region is insufficient to prove the origin of the arcade-and-figure concept in Middle Asia: the Tashkend sarcophagi seem rather to furnish the evidence we have been seeking for the introduction to the East of the columnar sarcophagus type of the West.21 Even if they are later by several centuries than the material we have been dealing with, the very survival of the bomme-arcade motif on these ossuaries seems to substantiate the hypothesis, already suggested by the Bimaran reliquary and the Bagh-gal stupas, that the form was introduced to Gandhara perhaps as early as the third century A.D. From what we know of the movement of artistic influences in the Late Antique world it is Unlikely that the arcade-and- figure motif originated in Gandhdra and spread from there to the West. The synthetic character of art in the twilight of the classic world is such that probably the truth lies in all the pro- posed explanations for the appearance of the concept in India; that is, it is derived ultimately from the fagades with engaged orders in the Roman world, and more specifically from the form as developed on Early Christian sarcophagi through the col- laboration of Syrian workmen who, as will be explained below, saw the appropriateness of this funerary architecture to the needs of the Buddhist church of Gandhdra. Since the developed form of the homme-arcade is unknown before the Asiatic sar- cophagi of the late second century A.D., it would be impossible to suppose that any occurrence of the type in Gandhara is prior to this date. In studying the photographs of the Gandhara stupas with their multiple images of Buddhas under arcades we are faced with another problem of an iconographical nature. It is not without importance for the stylistic aspects of the question: any- one seriously investigating the religious art of the East is bound to ask himself first of all whether the work of art he is examin- ing was made for the expression of a definite concept that de- termined its form. In this case, one is bound to ask whether the repeated figures of the Buddha, each one nearly identical to its neighbor, were made as parts of a whole representing the miraculous appearance of the Buddha in many places at one time, as in the Great Miracle of SrivastT and in the tran- scendental sections of the Lotus SiItra (Saddharma Pundarika), or whether these are merely repeated effigies of 85kyamuni du- plicated for the merit believed to accrue from the making of statues of the Great Teacher. From what we know of Buddhism in Gandhara there is little evidence that the sculpture of this region was dedicated to Mahaydna Buddhism: the only Bo- dhisattva recognizable in Gandhdra art is Maitreya; insofar as we know, the mystic Buddhas of Mahayina are unknown, and only 8ikyamuni and his mortal predecessors, the manusi Bud- dhas, are carved in the sanctuaries of northwestern India. More often than not, the number of statues seems determined solely by the dimensions of the space to be filled, but since the indi- vidual figures are differentiated from one another, it may be that they are either iSkyamuni at various moments of his career, or Sakyamuni and the Buddhas of the Past who were worshipped in Gandhara. The story related by Hsiian-tsang about the double-bodied Buddha at the great stupa of Kanishka at Peshawar furnishes us a clue to the significance of Buddha images on the stupas: in this legend two men each engaged an artist to paint a picture of the Enlightened One; when they came to pay their respects to the icons they had ordered, the two patrons were disappointed to find only one painting of the Buddha.22 At the artist's insistence that he had not defrauded them and that the picture would give some "spiritual indication" of this, the painted Buddha di- vided in two from the waist upwards and the two men "be- lieved and exulted."23 It is specifically implied in this passage that each man wished to have his own picture of the Buddha; in other words, we might well be justified in assuming that the multiple statues of Buddhas on the monuments at Taxila and Hadda are individual donations, or, at least, different likenesses of the same Buddha. In the photograph of the Ali-Masjid stupa (Fig. 9) one can make out statues of Buddhas and Bo- dhisattvas of various types: it is tempting to think of these as different deities or different aspects of the same deity each in its separate niche like the chapels dedicated to various saints or types of Christ in the ambulatory of a great cathedral. One could see in this repetition of the Buddha images on all four sides of the stupas the germ of the idea embodied in the four- faced statues of Lokesvara at Angkor which are not four-headed monsters but one deity both seen and seeing everywhere at once."2 The multiple Buddha images could be interpreted as representing not many different Buddhas but one Buddha seen everywhere and simultaneously. I have already suggested that the homme-arcade, a motif uni- versally employed for sepulchral monuments in the West, was for this reason found appropriate for the decoration of reli- quaries and stupas which can also be regarded as funerary in function. Diitschke in his brilliant chapter on the significance of the columnar sarcophagi in pagan and Christian art has suggested that, first and foremost, the pagan sarcophagus was the House of the Dead: it was also a representation of the Palace of Hades as abode of the shades.25 In Christian art the Palace of Hades is converted into the Halls of Heaven or the Heavenly Jerusalem: Christ and the Elect emerge from the colonnade that had formerly sheltered Apollo and the Muses as companions of the departed."2 What could be more appropriate for a sepulchral monument than the representation of the Celestial City where the soul hoped to dwell in peace with the Saviour? In the same way, the pagan sarcophagi with the flora and fauna of Elysium are converted into those Christian coffins that portray the bay trees, the gardens, and goodly walks of Jerusalem the Golden.2" The conception of Paradise as a "palace" is almost universal in Indian mythology: I need mention only the palace of the Cakravartin, the King of the World who sits enthroned in the center of the great wheel of the world, and that center is his palace on the summit of Mount Meru, the cosmic moun- tain that pillars apart Heaven and Earth.28 Sometimes the Heaven of the Tusita gods, the dwelling place of the Bo- dhisattva Siddhartha before his last incarnation, is likewise de- scribed as a palace. The nearest textual confirmation to the sug- gestion that the revetment of the stupa was in a sense a vision of celestial architecture is contained in the description of the building of the Lohipasada in the Mahivamsa.9 The significance of this seeming digression is that with the ac- ceptance of the komme-arcade as a means of representing the 20. Cf. J. Smirnoff, Argenterie orientale, St. Petersburg, 1909, pl. XLVI. 21. The Parthian sarcophagi occasionally have single figures standing in isolated niches, but this is hardly to be interpreted as a true homme- arcade (cf. Furlani, op. cit., pls. xii-xxli). 22. S.

In earlier Indian art, as for example on the East gate at Sifici, the palaces of the devas are represented as columnar halls probably drawn from contempo- rary architecture; such a conception of the Buddhist Heaven re- curs in the sixth-century fresco of Buddha in the Tusita Heaven in Cave 2 at Ajanta.30 In this regard, it is interesting to note that we may identify the three central figures of the Bimaran reliquary as a representation of the descent of 9Gkyamuni from the Tusita Heaven.3' The multiple images of Buddhas on the stupas of Gandhara, then, could be explained as representing the Buddha and the Buddhas of other kalpas enshrined in the golden halls of their heavens: the substitution of classical archi- tectural forms being made the easier by the fact that Indian ar- chitectural forms had already been used for paradisiacal settings in earlier Indian art. The fact that the homme-arcade was spe- cifically used to depict the architecture of the celestial regions in the West would only make it more acceptable to the Bud- dhists of Gandhara who always showed themselves open to bor- rowing ready-made classical types and techniques of all sorts for the realization of their iconographical ideals. The concept of the Buddhas in their heavens as a decoration for the exterior of the stupa is not in the least incompatible with the essential meaning of these monuments as symbols of the Universe.32 The hypothe- sis becomes even more convincing when we recall that, although the arcade undergoes a considerable transformation - into In- dian terms - it is still employed to shelter the Buddhas of the Four Directions whose multiple images once crowded the niches of the Mah5bodhi temple at Gaya and the many copies of that memorial in the Eastern world.33 Again, single images of Bud- dhas, either of the Four Buddhas of the Past or of the Four Mystic Buddhas, were often placed at the four sides of stupa bases to symbolize the Paradises of these Tathigatas at the four points of the compass.34 The Buddhas on the stupas of Gan- dhara, sitting or standing in a palatial architectural setting of mixed classical and Indian form, could then be said to be a primitive form of the Paradise iconography, a concept exactly paralleling the prototype of the Heavenly Jerusalem as sym- bolized by the arcades of the Early Christian sarcophagi. On the basis of the archaeological and iconographical evi- dence presented above, it seems inevitable to conclude that the BTmarin casket and the related monuments employing the homme-arcade device can be no earlier in date than the late second century A.D., when the form was first evolved in Asia Minor. As we have seen, the masonry of the stupa at Bimardn and others in the vicinity of Jelalibad confirms a dating no earlier than the second century A.D. Allowing for a time lag both for the introduction of the homme-arcade from the West and the introduction of the building methods employed at Taxila to southern Afghanistan, an even later chronology is in- dicated. This review of a limited aspect of the relation of Late Antique art to Gandhara corroborates my earlier argument on the basis of the style of the Buddha image that the finest of the Gandhira reliefs are derived from the sculpture of the period of Marcus Aurelius and later.35 HARVARD UNIVERSITY 30.
