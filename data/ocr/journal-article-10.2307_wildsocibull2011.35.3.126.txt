VERCAUTEREN, National Wildlife Research Center, United States Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Wildlife Services, 4101 LaPorte Avenue, Fort Collins, CO 80521-2154, USA ABSTRACT Fontenelle Forest (FF) is a 16.5-km2 serene natural area surrounded by a developed landscape, including Omaha and Bellevue, Nebraska, USA. An overabundant population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) degraded the local forest. In January 1995, we estimated the density of deer at 27 deer/km2 in FF and the adjacent Gifford PointWildlife Management Area (GP) and Bellevue residential (BR) area. We engaged in a public process to establish a deer management program in this developed landscape and learned from 15 years of experience. Formation of the Bellevue Deer Task Force led to implementation of controlled deer-hunting seasons from 1996 to present. Total annual harvest of white- tailed deer by archery and muzzleloader hunters at FF ranged from 28 in 1996 to 140 in 2006. Mean success rates of archery (52%) and muzzleloader hunters (93%) at FF were high compared to other areas. Densities of white-tailed deer in the study area declined from 27 deer/km2 in 1995 to 15 deer/km2 in 2006, though harvest and deer were not evenly distributed across the landscape. By 2006, densities of deer were near overwinter goals in the hunted FF lowlands, FF uplands, and GP lowlands (7 deer/km2, 5 deer/km2, and 13 deer/km2, respectively), but they remained relatively high in the adjacent unhunted BR area (30 deer/ km2). Native plant communities were severely overbrowsed in the study area through 1995, influencing their structure and composition, but signs of recovery were apparent in areas where controlled hunting reduced densities of deer to &lt;6 deer/km2. Controlled hunts at FF have reduced densities of deer in the immediate area to tolerable levels and have been accepted by area residents, with relatively little media coverage and public scrutiny. Total costs of controlled (US$120/deer) and depredation hunts (US$70/deer, 2010 prices) were low compared to other areas and methods. Common themes of the 15-year management program included cooperation, communication, leadership, research-based management, adaptive management, persistence, and resources.   2011 The Wildlife Society.

Dey, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission [NGPC], personal communication). Managers speculated that the population of white-tailed deer increased dramatically in the late 1980s due to decreased hunting and increased anthropomorphic food associated with the increasing housing density. In addition, it appeared that individual deer shifted their home ranges into the wooded uplands of FF and adjacent residential areas, and deer began to populate subdivisions of the BR area. By the mid 1990s, it was clear that the deer problem was spatially and logistically broader than FF could solve on its own. The Bellevue Deer Task Force (BDTF) was formed in March 1994 and consisted of city and county officials, local residents and landowners, FF and NGPC staff, and other Figure 1.

We felt this method was more appropriate than kernel-based procedures because with sample sizes &lt;30, kernel estimators tend to overesti- mate home range size while other methods underestimate home range size (Seaman et al. 1999). The mean number of locations/deer/year was 114 (SE 1⁄4 10, range 1⁄4 8–247). We used the 95% isopleth to delineate the boundary of each annual home range (White and Garrott 1990).

Number of muzzleloader hunters at FF increased steadily from a low of 13 in 1996 and leveled off around 80 from 2006 to 2008.
