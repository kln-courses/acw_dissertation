<plain_text><page sequence="1">MIRCEA ELIADE AND THE FEMINIST PARADIGM SHIFT Carol P. Christ Toward a Feminist Critical Approach to the History of Religion In recent years the existence of "prehistoric" and prepatriarchal God desses and the central roles of women in rituals and worship "at the very dawn of religion" have been documented and celebrated in scores of books and articles, both popular and scholarly. 1 This work, most of it informed by a feminist perspective, has the potential to bring about a paradigm shift in the understanding of religious history. It calls into question the paradigms through which the origin and history of religion have been conceptualized, revealing androcentric biases that had hitherto gone unrecognized. According to Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, whose work focuses on early Christian history, the "feminist critical paradigm" is suspicious of andro centric models and paradigms and questions the veracity of androcentric primary and secondary texts. The feminist critical approach is historical: it views religious ideas as rooted in time and space and affected by power relations. The question of women's religious and social roles is central in its analysis. According to Schiissler Fiorenza, a feminist critical paradigm re quires more than the concession of certain facts and hypotheses; it requires the construction of a critical framework in which the new facts and hypoth eses hang together, make sense, and affect our understanding of other facts and hypotheses.2 As applied to the origins of religion, the feminist critical paradigm questions the alleged universality of patriarchy and takes a fresh look at discredited theories which hypothesized a transition from "matriarchy" to 1 The most influential popular work is Merlin Stone, When God Was a Woman (New York: Dial Press, 1976): the quote "at the very dawn of religion" can be found on page 1; the works of Marija Gimbutas including The Language of the Goddess (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1989) and The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe 6500-3500 B.C.: Myths, Legends, and Cult Images (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982 [originally published as The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe in 1974]) present the views of an archaeologist who has excavated numerous Neolithic sites.

While the term matriarchy is generally viewed as misleading by the current generation of feminist scholars, there is renewed interest in the question of whether or not prepatriarchal societies existed, and in whether Goddess images at any time correlated with women's social power and/or religious leadership. Because Goddess symbolism originated in the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras which are called prehistoric due to the absence of written records, feminists have begun to insist that greater attention be paid to these periods.3 Feminist scholars trace the origin of religion to the Paleolithic period in which human communities survived by gathering and hunting and lived in small-scale groups or clans. In almost all gathering and hunting societies, women play important roles as the primary gatherers, providing a stable food supply that is supplemented by the hunt. In small-scale societies, birth is celebrated because it ensures the survival of the group. In this period images of female power, the so-called Paleolithic Venuses carved in bone and stone, were widespread. Rituals and burials were performed in womblike cavities within caves. Basing their interpretation on physical evidence and on similar patterns found in Neolithic and later traditions, feminist scholars suggest that both the cave and the female body were understood to be images of the creative power of the Goddess. They argue that women played important and valued social roles as birthgivers, as gatherers and possibly hunters, and that the Paleolithic "Venuses" also symbolized the religious and social power of women within the relatively egalitarian structure of the group or clan. In the Neolithic period, which is defined by the invention of agriculture, women's social and religious powers may have been even greater. If women invented and for a time played central roles in agriculture, then women's social status must have been high. Prosperous settled communities with no indication of wide class division, slavery, or warfare are characteristic. Images of the Goddess proliferate. The changing and transforming cycles of the female body were understood to be intimately connected to the waxing and waning of plant life in the fields, and both were symbolic of the Goddess's power of life, death, and transformation. Feminist scholars view Paleolithic and Neolithic societies as being pre patriarchal, probably matrilineal, and in the Neolithic, often matrilocal, though not necessarily "matriarchal." The term matriarchy, which literally 3 The divisions "history," the times for which we have translated written records, and "prehistory," the times for which no written records exist (or they exist but remain indecipherable), are themselves reflections of (implicitly patriarchal) biases of historians who believe "historical fact" can be firmly grounded only in the written word. The Paleolithic and Neolithic eras are thus declared but an opaque prelude to "real" history which begins with the records of patriarchal warriors, kings, and priests in the bronze and iron ages.

Feminist scholars have noted that most known patriarchal societies are characterized not only by the rule of men within family and society, but also are centrally organized and hierarchical, embracing class distinctions and slavery. Since frequent and organized warfare is characteristic of patriarchy, patriarchal society is most frequently ruled by men who are warriors or control the military. Since widespread warfare and centralized large-scale social organi zation (including class division and slavery) are not characteristic of all societies, then by this definition "prepatriarchal" societies must have ex isted. But if matriarchy is the opposite of patriarchy, then these societies should not be called matriarchal, since this would imply that there were large-scale class- and slave-based societies in which groups or classes of women ruled through control of the military. This never seems to have been the case. Indeed, the cross-cultural studies of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday suggest that societies celebrating images of female power are egalitarian.4 According to this feminist critical reading of history, the peaceful and egalitarian matrifocal societies of the Neolithic period came to an end as agriculture began to be transformed through the invention of technologies such as the iron plow and centrally organized irrigation techniques, which over time allowed some individuals to control large plots of land which were worked by others. This process was hastened by the invention of more deadly bronze and iron weapons and by the establishment of marauding and warfare as ways of life. Moreover, in many places, peaceful agricultural societies were attacked by warlike pastoral nomadic groups such as the Indo Europeans who with the horse invaded southern and eastern Europe and the Near East. Since women have apparently never participated in warfare on the same scale as men, the rise of the warrior to social power inevitably led to the decline in the social power of women as a group.5 This feminist critical reading is often attacked on the general grounds that nothing can conclusively be known about the prehistoric periods due to the absence of written records. But most historians acknowledge that all history writing is the product of selective reading of data: history is not so much a matter of fact as a matter of interpretation. And interpretation is affected not only by time and space, but also by power relations. Historians whose theories supported or support the power elite are more likely to have their books preserved or published, more likely to be given the resources to write. Many historians will acknowledge that the existing written records for 4 See Peggy Reeves Sanday, Female Power and Male Dominance: On the Origins of Sexual Inequality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981). 5 See Sanday.</page><page sequence="4">78 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion most historical periods are themselves limited and biased in favor of the powerful, given that most people were not literate, and that only a few had the skills and the time to write. Moveover, they will agree that both chance and power politics have dictated that only a small number of the written records from the past have survived. That is to say, many, if not most, historians will concede that our views of the past are neither complete nor unbiased. Yet when the question of the history of periods for which no written records exist is raised, most historians draw a sharp distinction between so called history and so-called prehistory. They allege that nothing can really be known about prehistory, while a great deal can be known about history. On the one hand, they display enormous, unwarranted faith in the reliability of written records, and on the other hand, they insist that in the absence of written records, vast periods of human history must remain unintelligible. They argue that interpretation of physical data is largely subjective, while interpretation of texts is by contrast, relatively objective. In so doing they display unacknowledged, but classical, Western bias against the physical. Behind their dismissal of the physical evidence from prehistory lies the Platonic notion that ideas expressed in the written word are more real than physical reality. But is this true? Let us look at just one example. Hesiod is one of the major surviving sources for our knowledge of Greek religion. His Theogony and Works and Days (c.700 B.C.E.) reflect the dominance of Zeus and the Olympians and strip the Goddesses of their prepatriarchal power. His views are quoted by almost every authority on Greek religion. Leaving aside the vexed question of the interpretation of the meaning of Hesiod's words, how do we know that Hesiod reflects widely held beliefs in his or any other period of Greek history? Other literary sources from Homer to the philosophers and the tragedians contradict or do not confirm many of his interpretations. Not everything Hesiod says about the Goddesses and Gods is confirmed in the prehistoric or historic archaeological records. Yet because his words are written and have survived, Hesiod becomes a major and respected source of knowledge about Greek mythology and religion. Most of Sappho's words were destroyed. But in several of her surviving poems a picture of Aphrodite very different from that of Hesiod is presented.6 Jane Ellen Harrison's study of vase paintings and inscriptions challenges Hesiod's view of the Goddesses; she states that Hesiod reshaped the Greek myths motivated by the "ugly malice of theological animus."7 But Sappho is not frequently quoted as an authority on Greek religion. Jane Harrison's work seems to have been forgot 6 See Mary Barnard, Sappho: A New Translation (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1958). 7 See Jane Ellen Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1903: reprint, London: Merlin Press, 1962), ch. 6 and p. 285.</page><page sequence="5">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 79 ten by historians of religion.8 And few contemporary scholars pay as much attention to artistic records of history and prehistory, or even to inscriptional records, as they do to the words of Hesiod, which are readily accessible and systematic. The influence of Hesiod on contemporary understanding of Greek religion suggests a pattern common in androcentric scholarship: one male authority is cited by another male authority in a neverending chain stretching back into the past. Testimony of outsiders (including primary and secondary texts by women) and evidence that does not fit with the words of the recognized authorities is ignored. Unmasking Androcentric Bias Careful analysis of Mircea Eliade's A History of Religious Ideas will show that androcentric assumptions are deeply structured into Eliade's con ceptions of the nature and origin of religion.9 These biases make it virtually impossible for him to recognize the importance of women and Goddesses in the history of religion. A History of Religious Ideas is an appropriate choice for such an analysis on several counts. First, Mircea Eliade is probably the most widely read and influential historian of religion of the twentieth cen tury. His many works have appealed to scholars, students, and general readers alike. A History of Religious Ideas, a three-volume series undertaken at the end of his life, was understood by Eliade to be the culminating work in which he would distill and summarize the insights of a scholarly career that spanned more than fifty years. In addition, because of his attempt to present "the spiritual history of humanity" (xvi), Eliade devoted considerable atten tion to the origins of religion in the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods which are also of interest to feminists. Indeed, though never claiming to be a feminist, Eliade seems to concede a number of facts and hypotheses that are also found in feminist readings of early religious history, as I will discuss below.10 It is somewhat surprising, then, to discover how deeply the struc tures of androcentric thinking shape Eliade's understanding of the origins and history of religion. Careful attention to the way such biases function in Eliade's chapters on Paleolithic, Neolithic, and classical Greek religion can help us to understand why the androcentric scholarly tradition cannot pro vide an accurate picture of the roles of women and Goddess symbolism in the origin and history of religion. A History of Religious Ideas affirms a number of the conclusions of the 8 In a lecture presented at the 1988 meetings of the American Academy of Religion Ursula King argued that the work of women scholars has been systematically excluded from the scholarly canon in religion.

The questions of the students in that class provoked the writing of this essay.</page><page sequence="6">80 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion feminist critical reading of the origins and history of Western religion. Eliade begins his history with a discussion of religion in the Paleolithic and Neo lithic periods. He discusses the question of the "extensive" distribution of "feminine representations" (20) in the Paleolithic. He writes that with the discovery of agriculture in the Neolithic: woman and feminine sacrality are raised to the first rank. Since women played a decisive part in the domestication of plants, they became the owners of the cultivated fields, which raises their social position and creates characteristic institutions, such as, for example, matrilocation, the husband being obliged [sic] to live in his wife's house. (40) Eliade acknowledges that Neolithic societies were violently overthrown when he states that "the irruption of the Indo-Europeans into history is marked by terrible destruction" (187) dating at least from the end of the third millenium to the end of the second millineum B.C.E. He understands that new social structures were introduced by the invaders, "Pastoral nomadism, the patriarchal structure of the family, a proclivity for raids, and a military organization designed for conquest are characteristic features of Indo-Euro pean societies" (188). He recognizes that new religious symbols and con ceptions accompanied the Indo-Europeans, for whom "the idea of god proves to be bound up with celestial sacrality, that is with light and transcen dence (height) and, by extension, with the idea of sovereignty and with creativity in its immediate [sic] meaning: cosmogony and paternity. The (god of the) sky is supremely father" (189). In his discussion of Greek religion he notes that Zeus's dominance is achieved by "appropriating the pre-Hellenic local goddesses, venerated from time immemorial. Zeus replaces them and, in so doing, begins the process of symbiosis and unification that will give Greek religion its specific characteristic" (250). In these passages Eliade corroborates much of the feminist critical reading of the prehistory and history of Western religion: the wide distribu tion of female images in the Paleolithic; the role of women as inventors of agriculture; the absence of male dominance and the religious prominence of Goddesses in the Neolithic;1l the conquest of indigenous societies and transformation of their social structures and religious symbolism by Indo European patriarchal warrior groups'2 who worshipped the sky father. Yet despite these points of agreement, Eliade's reading of the history of religion 11 While Eliade speaks of "woman" holding the "first rank," contemporary feminists speak of female power without the imputation of female dominance; Sanday argues that societies that acknowledge female power tend to be egalitarian, while societies that do not are male dominant. 12 The notion of "Indo-European invasions," while accepted by Eliade, has been dis puted by other scholars. I use the term here, while recognizing that it is shorthand for a series of patriarchal invasions by pre-Indo-European and Indo-European groups. Accord ing to Marija Gimbutas these invasions began c. 4400 B.C.E. in old Europe and continued for several millenia. Eliade remarks that Indo-European conquest continues up to the present day in the guise of Western imperialism and colonialism.</page><page sequence="7">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 81 is deeply androcentric, and in the end proves disappointing to those who seek to recover the history of women and Goddess symbolism in Western religion. The feminist critical approach to the history of religion requires a critical framework in which the history of women and female symbolism is considered significant. Eliade's understanding of religion is deeply structured by androcentric assumptions that serve to highlight the religious contributions of men and male symbolisms, while obscuring the contributions of women and female symbolisms. Among these assumptions three stand out. One is Eliades Platonic definition of "the sacred" as standing in opposition to "the chaotic and dangerous flux of things." A second is his idealistic focus on "religious ideas" that are "later valorized," which allows him to ignore the significance of power politics, including the struggle for patriarchal dominance, in the history of religion. The third is his belief that religion originated in the primordial hunt and that the symbols of hunting religion, especially the projectile weapon, blood sacrifice and communion, and the worship of the sky God, are among the basic structures of religious consciousness that manifest themselves again and again in the history of religion. In his brief preface to The History of Religious Ideas, Eliade states several assumptions which shape his work. The first is that "the sacred" is "an element in the structure of consciousness" (xiv), a Kantian sort of assumption that commits him to finding religion in eyery situation in which human beings have lived. While this assumption is not self-evident to every modern student of religion, I do not wish to question it here. But when Eliade describes the content of consciousness of the sacred, subtle biases which I read as patriarchal begin to intrude. Eliade writes: Through experience of the sacred, the human mind has perceived the difference between what reveals itself as being real, powerful, rich, and meaningful and what lacks these qualities, that is the chaotic and dangerous flux of things, their fortuitous and senseless appearances and disappearances.13 Close examination of this apparently formal and noncommital definition of the nature of religion reveals a subtle Platonism: consciousness of the sacred is located in the mind, not the body-sense-mind continuum, and is posited in opposition to "the chaotic and dangerous flux of things." Eliade appropriates the Platonic notion that the changing world which appears to the body and its senses is but a shadow of a more "real" world perceived by the mind which is not chaotic, dangerous, fortuitous, senseless, or in flux. One of the early and continuing themes of feminist theology and thealogy is the critique of du alisms between mind and body. 14 Elsewhere I have argued both that feminist thealogy ought to accept change as one of the conditions of life, and that the 13 Mircea Eliade, The Quest: History and Meaning in Religion (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1969), xiv. 14 Literature on this subject is extensive. Rosemary Radford Ruether and Mary Daly were among the first to elaborate this theme.</page><page sequence="8">82 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion labeling of change as dangerous and chaotic is typical of patriarchal philoso phies and theologies. 15 I have also argued that the assumption that divinity represents rationality, order, and transcendence of finitude, change, and death has rendered the prehistoric Goddesses baffling to scholars because the images of the prehistoric Goddesses celebrate change in the form of birth, death, and transformation.16 It should also be noted that patriarchal world views tend to view the female body with its effluents of blood and birth waters as being more closely linked to the dangerous flux of finitude than the male body. Another assumption Eliade mentions in his preface is his decision to focus his history of religion on "crises in depth and above all, on the creative moments" in which religion is transformed and renewed. Though again apparently value neutral, this assumption may lead Eliade to find the re ligions of relatively peaceful and stable societies uninteresting. Finally, Eliade states that "later valorizations" of religious ideas and symbolisms are one of his criteria of inclusion. Since the major civilizations of both East and West have been patriarchal for thousands of years, this criterion too biases him towards granting greater significance to manifestations of religion associ ated with the male gender. Eliade assumes that that which is valid is valorized, and that religious symbols, like Platonic forms and Jungian arche types, are not significantly affected by power politics. 7 This criterion invali dates critiques of religious symbols as being rooted in power relations or violence. In contrast the feminist critical approach is suspicious of the inherent validity of the modalities of meaning and power which have been "valorized" in patriarchal societies. In his discussion of Paleolithic religion, Eliade discusses the difficulty of reconstructing the history of early human beings or "Paleoanthropians," because the evidence is "opaque," especially for periods before 30,000 B.C.E. where the evidence is of bones and tools, not "works of art" (6). However, invoking his notion that the sacred is a structure of consciousness, he asserts that the earliest humans must have been aware of the sacred. Following the schools that state that the first humans differed from animals by virtue of their upright posture, he concludes that for early humans-but not animals-space would have been organized in four horizontal directions plus up and down, a structure he finds central in much religious symbolism. He further argues that early "man" must have had the experience of"feeling 'thrown' into the middle of an apparently limitless, unknown, and threaten ing extension" (3). Here Eliade reads modern Western existentialism and its 15 See Laughter of Aphrodite, ch. 12. 16 See my "Toward a Paradigm Shift." 17 See Naomi R. Goldenberg, "Archetypal Theory and the Separation of Mind and Body: Reason Enough to Turn to Freud?" Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, 1, no. 1 (1985), 55-72.</page><page sequence="9">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 83 sense of alienation from nature and community into the earliest human consciousness. Not only is this anachronistic, but it may also reflect gender bias: feminist object relations theorists and others claim that the experience of alienation from the mother and from all forms of relationships is more pronounced in the gender development of modern Western males than in their female counterparts. 18 The assumption of early man's fear of an "appar ently limitless, unknown, and threatening extension" influences Eliade's understanding of the centrality of the projectile weapon and the sky father in early religious consciousness. Eliade endows humans' "decision to kill [animals and, as we shall see, people] in order to live" (4) with the highest significance. In short, the hominians succeeded in outstripping their ancestors by becoming flesh-eaters. For some two million years, the Paleoanthro pians lived by hunting; fruits, roots, mollusks, and so on, gathered by the women and children, did not suffice to insure the survival of the species. Hunting determined the division of labor in accordance with sex, thus reinforcing "hominization"; for among the carnivores, and in the entire animal world, no such difference exists. (4) By focusing on meat-eating as decisive to human survival, Eliade values the contributions of "man the hunter" while devaluing the contributions of "woman the gatherer." Recent feminist literature discussing woman the gatherer suggests that it is equally arguable that humanity would not have survived without the protein provided by the gathering done by women and children and sometimes men. Indeed, it is not conclusively proved that women did not participate in early hunting. Eliade's bias in favor of the creative innovation leads him to value hunting over gathering. And the bias introduced here further supports his notion that the projectile weapon is the most significant and religiously charged tool of the early human community. Moreover, Eliade asserts that the hierarchical valorization of gender roles is typical of the earliest human societies and of human nature itself. While I do not dispute the general hypothesis that early human groups probably prac ticed a (perhaps flexible rather than rigid) division of labor, I argue, with many feminist anthropologists, that in small groups the division of labor is covalent, with both women and men being valued for their contribution to group survival.19 Invoking his hypothesis of the sacred as a structure of consciousness, Eliade asserts that tools must have been sacralized, an assumption I agree with. He then goes on to grant highest value to the projectile weapon: "It is, above all, mastery over distance, gained by the projectile weapon, which gave rise to countless beliefs, myths, and legends" (6). Eliade does not see 18 See for example, Catherine Keller, From a Broken Web: Separation, Sexism, and Self (Boston: Beacon Press, 1986) for a recent statement of this position. 19 See Frances Dahlberg, Woman the Gatherer (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1981).</page><page sequence="10">84 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion that tools for the preparation and preservation of food and clothing may have been endowed with equally significant sacrality, as later religious practices and symbols such as the ritual dressing of statues, the weaving of fate, communion bread, and the magic cauldron suggest. Eliade mentions that the invention of fire was endowed with sacred meaning, but he does not pursue the clues of later mythology (for example, Hestia, Vesta, Brigid) that women may have invented or at least tended the sacred fire. In his discussion of the rituals of the hunters Eliade hypothesizes on the basis of very little concrete evidence that "divinities of the type Supreme Being-Lord of the Wild Beasts" (7, note capitalization)-as well as animal spirits were probably worshipped in the Paleolithic. But when discussing what he calls "feminine representations in the last Ice Age" he does not use the words "Supreme Being," "Lady of the Wild Beasts" or "Goddess." In fact he states that it is not possible to know what these widely distributed images meant. It is impossible to determine the religious function of these figurines. Presumably they in some sort represent feminine sacrality and hence the magico-religious powers of the goddesses [note lower case]. The "mystery" constituted by woman's particular mode of existence has played an important part in numerous religions both primitive and historical. (21, my italics) Since Eliade is not nearly so tentative in discussing the religious symbolism associated with hunting, we must ask why he suddenly becomes circumspect when confronted with images that suggest a female Supreme Being? Is it because he cannot imagine that women or female symbolism were central in Paleolithic religion, that is, at the time of origins? It is worth noting that the conventional use of diminutives-"figurines" and "statuettes"-while tech nically descriptive of the small size of Paleolithic and Neolithic female images, serves to trivialize them. While small male images exist, they are not so relentlessly described as masculine "figurines" or "statuettes." Though Eliade grants universal significance to the acts and symbols of man the hunter, the images of "feminine sacrality" are not similarly universalized, but are said to represent "woman's particular existence" [my italics]. Nor does he speculate on the "mystery" of mans particular mode of existence. As is usual in androcentric interpretations, man and male experience represent the universal and the norm, women and female experience, the particular, the deviation.20 In discussing Paleolithic burials Eliade is concerned to argue that Pal 20 See Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, trans. H. M. Parshley (New York: Knopf, 1953). Eliade repeats this particularistic language throughout his work; see, for example, vol. 2 (1982), 410: "Marian theology represents the transfiguration of the earliest and most significant homage paid, from the time of prehistory, to the religious meaning of woman hood."</page><page sequence="11">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 85 eolithic people must have had a notion of individual or personal survival, a belief that is congruent with his notion that the sacred stands in opposition to "the dangerous flux of things" which ends in individual death (10-11). He does not consider the possibility that burials might reflect notions of collec tive or communal survival, or simply symbolize a return to the Mother. Eliade notes that corpses were usually buried with red ochre, often in a fetal position. For him red ochre symbolizes blood and hence, life (9). But he does not speculate that the red ochre might have represented the female blood of birth, nor that the corpses were set in fetal position in order to symbolize return to the womb of the Mother. That Eliade does not consider this possible explanation of the burial rites (and their connection with the al legedly mysterious female images) is rendered even more odd by the fact that he quotes extensively from a description of a Kogi (Columbian) Indian burial ritual in which, as he notes, the corpse is returned to the "Universal Mother" (11-12). And though he mentions that both burial and other rituals were performed in caves, he does not consider the possibility that the cave might have symbolized the womb of the "Universal Mother. "21 Eliade leaves the reader with the impression that aside from a few indecipherable "figurines," Paleolithic religion was a male affair, an interac tion between (male) hunters and a (male) Lord of the Wild Beasts (7, 13, 15, 18, 26). Could this be because Eliade finds the alleged symbols of hunting religion, including the projectile weapon, sacrificial death, blood commun ion, and worship of the male supreme being repeated in later patriarchal religions, most especially in Christianity?22 And because images associated with the female body symbolize the dangerous flux of things which he finds antithetical to the sacred? Eliade's statement that in the Neolithic "women and feminine sacrality are raised to the first rank" (40, my italics), reflects his assumption that neither one was particularly important in the Paleolithic. And despite this concession of their importance, Eliade pays relatively little attention either to women's religious roles or to the valorization of female images in his discussion of Neolithic religion. One senses his impatience with the notion of female power when he defines Neolithic "matrilocation" as "the husband being obliged [my italics] to live in his wife's home," implying that this practice is an unnatural deviation from a patrilocal norm, which could not possibly have been willingly accepted by men. Eliade states that in the Neolithic "feminine sexuality becomes insepara 21 See G. Rachel Levy, Religious Conceptions of the Stone Age and their Influence on European Thought (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963 [originally published as The Gate of Horn in 1948]). 22 See for example, vol. 2 (1982), 404, where Eliade writes, "In the language of theology, it could be said that, integrated into a Christian scenario, a number of archaic traditions gain their 'redemption.'"</page><page sequence="12">86 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion ble from the miraculous enigma of creation" (41), but even here he does not speak of a female Supreme Being or Creator Goddess. He never uses the term Goddess religion as descriptive of Neolithic religion, and when he uses his preferred term, cosmic religion (41ff.), he seems to forget his earlier statement that feminine sacrality is raised to the first rank. Thus he can speak of the World Tree as a central symbol of cosmic religion, without speculating on its relation to Goddess imagery, and of the sacralization of space and dwellings, without mentioning that in a matrilocal society dwellings would have been passed through the motherline, and that some of the earliest religious structures seem to be modeled on the body of the Goddess.23 When he mentions the "feminine statuettes" of the Neolithic period, he designates them as part of a "fertility cult" (45), not as central images of cosmic religion. His first reference to a "Mother Goddess" (sixteen pages into his text on the Neolithic) speaks of her "terrifying and demonic aspect," (45) which is not the norm in Neolithic imagery. The term Mother Goddess appears only two other times (in 26 pages): once qualified by a double negative (47), and once when he remarks that the images of the "Mother Goddess and Child" are "comparatively scarce in the Danubian regions" (49).24 Eliade devotes approximately three pages to a discussion of specific examples of the Neolithic culture at Jericho, Tell Ramad, Hacilar, (atal Hiiyiik, and Tell Halaf in the Near East, and another page to Old Europe. Though he mentions "feminine statuettes" in Jericho, he is more interested in Jericho's foreshadowing of "the future city states of Mesopotamia" (45). In his discussion of Tell Ramad, he notes that "anthropomorphic figurines" were found, but gives detail only on one bisexual image found in nearby Byblos and the "feminine statuettes" from Palestine c. 4500 B.C.E. which manifest the aforementioned "terrifying and demonic [the meaning of these terms is not explained] aspect" of the Mother Goddess. In his discussion of Catal Hiyiik and Hacilar he notes that the "principal divinity is the goddess" (46), and provides a (very) few details of the imagery. He states that in Tell Halaf "no masculine figurines have been found, whereas the images of the goddess are abundant" (47). Finally in his summary of Marija Gimbutas's research on Old Europe (49-50), he makes no mention of her thesis that the largest number of images found are of the Goddess as Creatrix and principle of Renewal and Regeneration. In reading through these sparse pages, one gets 23The association of sacred trees with female symbolism and Goddesses is widespread in later periods in the Near East and Mediterranean; for example on Cretan seal rings, in the association of Innana with the date palm, in the reverence of Asherah in the form of sacred tree [pole], and it probably lies behind the Genesis 2-3 story of Eve. For matrilocation and the burial of female bones in dwellings, see James Mellaart, Gatal Hiuyuk (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967); for temples as images of the body of the Goddess, see Marija Gimbutas, The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe. 24 According to Gimbutas the images of the Goddess are widespread in this area.</page><page sequence="13">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 87 a sense of Eliade's lack of enthusiasm for this material. This suspicion is corroborated in Eliade's statement that "the archaeological documents [of] Neolithic religion run the risk of appearing simplistic and monotonous" (50). Perhaps he would have found this period more interesting if he had seen its essential unity in the actuality and universal symbolism of female power. This would have raised at least one very interesting question: What hap pened? Could it be that Eliade is bored by this period because it does not fit in with his generally androcentric theories about religion and finds it sim plistic because it does not focus on transcendence or valorize male superi ority? When Eliade sums up Neolithic religion he writes: We have just seen what the religious documents of the earliest Neolithic cultures reveal: cults of the dead and fertility, indicated by statuettes of goddesses and of the storm god (with his ephiphanies: the bull, the bucranium); beliefs and rituals connected with the "mystery" of vegetation; the assimilation woman/cultivated soil/plant, implying the homology birth/rebirth; very probably the hope of a postexistence; a cosmology including the symbolism of a "center of the world" and inhabited space as imago mundi. (50) How different these same facts would sound if organized around the central symbol of the Goddess and the socioreligious roles of women as inventors of agriculture. Why did Eliade not begin his summary with his own statement that in the Neolithic "women and feminine sacrality are raised to the first rank since women played a decisive part in the domestication of plants [and] became owners of the cultivated fields." He might then have continued: in the Neolithic the Goddess rules over a religion centered around birth, death, rebirth: the mysteries of the female body including the awesome power to give birth become universal symbols of the birth and growth of the crops; male power is also recognized in the symbol of the bull and the young male god; both the seed and the human corpse are returned to the mother in order to be reborn; the center of the world is the womb or navel of the Goddess; the earliest temples are symbols of her body. Perhaps if he had been willing or able to see the essential unity of Neolithic culture and religion, his writing about it would have been more than a disjointed and halfhearted catalogue. Perhaps he would also have been forced to recognize the Neolithic not only as valorizing (from this perspective more comprehen sible) images of the Goddesses from the Paleolithic, but also as leading to valorizations, transformations, and devalorizations of female power and female imagery in later religions of the Near East and Europe up to the present day. But this of course would have required transformation of many of his basic hypotheses about the nature and function of religion. Eliade's spirits seem to pick up when he reaches the Iron Age where he notes that with the rise of the miner and the smith, "The artisan takes the</page><page sequence="14">88 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion place of Mother Earth [note caps] in order to hasten and perfect the 'growth' of the ores. The furnaces are in some sort a new, artificial womb, in which the ore completes its gestation" (53). Though the Goddess image is valorized, transformed, and devalorized in Iron Age religion and in later Christian and Eastern religions, Eliade does not focus on this here. But he waxes eloquent about the "smith" as a widespread religious symbol, among other things as inspiration to one of Eliade's favorite groups, the medieval alchemists (54 55). Given his stated aversion to the "chaotic and dangerous flux of things" (xiii), it is not surprising that Eliade would prefer an artificial to a physical womb, and the religious symbol of the smith who improves on nature, over the Goddess who bleeds and gives birth and takes the dead back into her body, manifesting, so to speak, the flux of nature. In his chapter on the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and early Iron Age, Eliade displays unqualified approval at only one other point: in his discussion of the transformation of hunters into warriors, which he dates to the Neolithic. As he states: Probably a number of hunters [real men?] who refused to take an active part in the economy of the cultivators were employed as guardians of the villages-first against the wild beasts that harassed the sedentary populations and damaged the cultivated fields, later against marauders. Probably, too, the first military organizations took shape from these groups of hunters acting as guardians. As we shall soon see warriors, conquerors, and military aristocracies carry on the symbolism and ideology of the paradigmatic hunter. (35) Eliade's rhetoric indicates that he finds the violence of the warriors and conquerors more praiseworthy than the practice of matrilocation, for there is not even the slightest rhetorical indication of censure of the force employed by conquerors. To the contrary Eliade's rhetoric valorizes the activities of the warriors, and he cannot restrain himself from moving ahead of his story. He writes without the slightest hint of irony or criticism that: the invasions of the Indo-Europeans and the Turk-Mongols will be undertaken under the sign of the supreme hunter, the carnivore. The members of the Indo-European confraternities (Miinnerbiinde) and the nomadic horseman of Central Asia behaved toward the sedentary populations that they attacked like carnivores hunting, strangling, and devouring the herbivores of the steppe or the farmers' cattle ... the pursuit and killing of the wild animal becomes the mythical mode for the conquest of a territory (Landnama) or the founding of a state. (36) With this introduction, Eliade moves on to applaud the Indo-Europeans in subsequent chapters.25 Eliade's discussion of Greek religion properly begins with his considera 25 When I wrote this essay (on a Greek island), I was horrified by Eliade's glorification of brute conquest and destruction of whole peoples, but I was not aware of the growing</page><page sequence="15">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 89 tion of the "irruption of the Indo-Europeans into history" in his chapter on the Vedic gods. Eliade's survey of Greek religion assumes the conquest of the inhabitants of the land and islands now called Greece by the Indo-Europeans who brought with them "the patriarchal structure of the family, a proclivity for raids, and a military organization designed for conquest," as well as "a god of the sky [who] is supremely father," namely Zeus, who "appropriated the pre-Hellenic local goddesses." Further Eliade recognizes that the pa triarchal mythologies and symbolisms of Greek religion were the product of violence. For example, Eliade states that Delphi was a "venerable oracular site, where from ancient times the sacrality and the powers of Mother Earth were manifested" (271). And he comments that the stories of Apollo's con quest of Delphi are an "aggressive mythology" which "has its parallel in the history of Apollo's penetration into Greece. Briefly, it is the history of his replacing, more or less brutally, many pre-Hellenic local divinities, a process that is characteristic of Greek religion as a whole" (268). In these and other passages Eliade concedes the outlines of a feminist critical reading of Greek religion. Reading between the lines of Eliade's text, one glimpses a story of a gradual but violent overthrow of more peaceful and egalitarian agricultural societies in which women and Goddesses at one time had (or shared) "the first rank" by patriarchal warrior groups. In this overthrow, the many defend ers of the indigenous culture, both women and men, female as well as male religious and social leaders, were no doubt killed, enslaved, and raped. As a consequence of rule by patriarchal warrior groups, women's social and reli gious roles were diminished and devalorized. As violence and conquest became normative, they were valorized in patriarchal mythologies. But Eliade does not tell this story, for to tell it would require the recognition that religious ideas are significantly shaped (for better and worse) by social structures, power politics, and violence. It would require moving beyond the realm of "religious ideas" to a conception of religion as deeply embedded in concrete historical situations. Eliade does not systematically discuss the transformation and devaloriza tion of Neolithic religious ideas in Greek religion, and he never directly comments on women's (or others') loss of status and power in Indo-European religions and societies. He valorizes the violence of the warrior and con queror as being the logical outcome of the Paleoanthropians' decision to become flesh-eaters, that is to kill in order to live. Conducting his analysis on controversy surrounding Eliade's alleged fascist sympathies and/or activities during World War II. But the congruence of the ideas expressed in the above quotations with fascism was not lost on the audience to whom I presented this paper at the 1988 meetings of the American Academy of Religion. A highly emotional debate ensued in which a number of people castigated Eliade's ideology while others defended the great scholar and teacher with tears in their eyes and catching in their throats.</page><page sequence="16">90 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion the level of "ideas," he views the killing of animals and the killing of human beings as having the same structure. The patriarchal Indo-Europeans are presented as the inheritors of the hunting mythology-which Eliade views as the earliest religious vision of human beings-with its valorization of men and male activities, the projectile weapon, killing, communion, and an allegedly male Supreme Being. Eliade's discussion of Greek religion is divided into three chapters, "Zeus and the Greek Religion," "The Olympians and the Heroes," and "The Eleusinian Mysteries." This organizational structure reflects Eliade's deci sion to treat Greek religion as a finished patriarchal product. He makes no attempt to recover the prepatriarchal pre-Hellenic religion of Greece which the Indo-Europeans confronted and transformed, nor does he seriously attempt to recover early Greek religion. Eliade relies almost exclusively on androcentric texts, such as Homer, Hesiod and the tragedians, written hundreds of years after the entrance of the Indo-Europeans into Greece. He pays relatively little attention to archaelogical records, such as wall and vase paintings, sculptures, temples, votive offerings, and inscriptions, which demonstrate more clearly than the works of Homer and Hesiod, the linger ing presence of pre-Indo-European religious ideas, among them, the power of the Goddesses, and provide clues concerning women's religious leadership and participation. If Eliade had taken a historical approach to the develop ment of Greek religion, he might have begun by discussing the pre-Hellenic Goddesses, such as Gaia, Demeter, and Hera.26 As it is he sandwiches brief discussions of four of the Greek Goddesses in between the Gods and the heroes, while two others are the subject of his final chapter. Eliade begins his discussion of Greek religion with a lengthy summary of Hesiod's version of the creation, uncritically accepting Hesiod's account of the "triumph and sovereignty of Zeus" (250). Eliade restates Hesiod's myth that the first humans in the so-called age of gold were exclusively men. He comments that the myth of the "'perfection of beginnings' and of primordial bliss, both lost as the result of an accident or 'sin,' is comparatively wide spread" (254). But he does not find the absence of women from this primor dial scene noteworthy. A few pages later when he quotes Hesiod's version of the creation of the first woman, Pandora, that "beautiful evil," "a terrible plague set among mortal men" (256), he makes no comment at all. He does not label Hesiod a misogynist, nor does he ask why Hesiod considers the creation of woman to be a punishment. He does not mention that Pandora means "All Gifts," nor does he note that even after Hesiod, Pandora was 26 A very different view of Greek religion is found in Vincent Scully, The Earth, the Temple, and the Gods: Greek Sacred Architecture, rev. ed. (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1979 [1962]). Scully begins with a discussion of the importance of the landscape in Greek sacred architecture, moves from there to a consideration of the Goddess in Minoan and Indo-European Mycenean temples, followed by chapters on Hera, Demeter, Artemis and Aphrodite, and finally Apollo, Zeus, Poseidon and Athena.</page><page sequence="17">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 91 represented on vases as "the Earth, giver of all gifts," a conception that was recognized by writers as late as Aristophanes, Athenaeus, and Philostratos.27 When discussing Zeus's "appropriation of the pre-Hellenic local god desses," Eliade speaks of"a series of marriages," "numerous liasons," "hiero gamies," and "erotic adventures" (250). He does not call Zeus's swallowing of Athena's mother Metis murder, nor does he mention that many of Zeus's sacred marriages were rapes. This is not a trivial linguistic point. Feminists have pointed out that rape is one of the ordinary structures of patriarchal war, of slavery, and of patriarchal marriage. Was rape of priestesses and other women one of the methods the Indo-Europeans used to subdue the local populations? Eliade's failure to call attention to Zeus's rapes serves to valorize this patriarchal structure. Later Eliade states that in Greek religion: man ended by realizing the perfection and, consequently the sacra lity of the human condition. In other words, he rediscovered and brought to full the religious sense of the "joy of life," the sacramental value of erotic experience and the beauty of the human body. (262) Here Eliade's genderized language is ironically accurate. From a certain perspective-that of the conquering and ruling males-Eliade's statement may indeed be true. But was it true for those whom they conquered, enslaved, and raped, while claiming that such activities were "godlike"? In his second chapter on Greek religion ("The Olympians and the Heroes"), Eliade considers Poseidon, Hephaestus, Apollo, Hermes, and the heroes. In between he devotes a few pages to the Goddesses Hera, Artemis, Athene, and Aphrodite. Eliade's interpretations of the Gods focus on their valorizations of themes brought out in his discussions of Paleolithic and Iron Age religion. For example, Eliade reiterates his valorization of the smith when he writes, "Nowhere else is the equivalence of magic and technological perfection better brought out than in the mythology of Hephaestus" (266-7). In his discussion of Apollo and the "symbolism of the bow," Eliade further elaborates his conception of the symbolism of the projectile weapon: Thanks to Apollo, the symbolism of the bow and of archery reveals other spiritual situations: mastery over distance (and hence detach ment from the "immediate," from the viscosity of the concrete), the calm and serenity implied by every effort of intellectual con centration. (274) Here we see the connection between Eliade's valorization of the symbolism of the projectile weapon "above all" and the Platonism implicit in his con ception of religion as providing release from the "chaotic and dangerous flux of things, their fortuitous and senseless appearances and disappearances." We can also see in Apollo's bow the valorization of the calm and serene intellectual concentration of the twentieth-century scholar, who while writ 27 Harrison, 279-85.</page><page sequence="18">92 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion ing about his conceptions of religion attempts to detach himself from the "'immediate,' from the viscosity of the concrete." Though Eliade assumes that the Greek Goddesses are devalorizations of pre-Hellenic Goddesses, he does not address this question systematically. He mentions female initiation ceremonies in relation to Artemis (279), but he does not discuss the question of whether Goddesses had a special appeal to women, whether they were served by priestesses, or to what extent rituals to the Goddesses reflected pre-Hellenic religious conceptions. He notes that Hera was originally the Goddess of Argos whose powers were "universal fecundity," but he asserts that from the time of Homer her sphere was reduced to marriage, a view not universally accepted.28 He finds it "difficult to determine the original meaning" of Hera's annual renewal of her virginity, and guesses that it must be related to patriarchal conceptions (277-8), but does not mention that it may reflect a prepatriarchal conception of"virginity as a grace not lost but perpetually renewed."29 Of the statue of Artemis at her great temple in Ephesus, in which she is imaged (in the copies that survive) in her pre-Hellenic cosmic aspect as Giver of All, with outstretched arms, many egg breasts, and animal faces embedded in her trunk, Eliade writes, "the maternal function was represented so plastically-so grotesquely [my italics] that we hesitate to recognize a Greek divinity in/it" (279). But Eliade makes no similar comment on the "ithyphallic" (2,74) statues of Hermes which some might view as sprouting grotesquely exaggerated erections. In his third chapter, on "The Eleusinian Mysteries," Eliade turns his attention to myths and rituals associated with Demeter and Persephone. At the end of his chapter, he admits that Demeter was the most popular among the goddesses worshipped in the regions of Greece and the Greek colonies. She was also the oldest; morphologically, she continued the Great Goddesses of the Neolithic.... It may be admitted that the Eleusinian Mysteries were bound up with an agricultural mystique, and it is probable that the sacrality of sexual activity, vegetable fertility, and food at least partly shaped the initiatory scenario. (300) He also states that "the initiation revealed both closeness to the divine world and continuity between life and death. These certainly are ideas shared by archaic religions of the agricultural type but suppressed by the Olympian religion" (299). Yet he does not explore the connection between the Eleusi nian mysteries and the Thesmophoria, agricultural rituals for women only which also centered around Demeter and her daughter, and clearly have their roots in the Neolithic.30 Nor does he discuss the roles of women as priestesses in the Eleusinian rites. As is evident from his placing this chapter at the end rather than the beginning of his discussion of Greek religion, 28 Harrison, 315-18. 29 Harrison, 311-12. 30 Harrison, ch. 4.</page><page sequence="19">Christ: Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift 93 Eliade is more interested in the Eleusinian mysteries as precursor of later religious ideas, especially the "blissful existence [of the soul] after death" (292) and "initiatory secrecy" (301), than in their connection to religious ideas stemming from the Neolithic. Indeed he states, "it is difficult to believe that the supreme initiation was confined to an anamnesis of archaic sacraments" (300). Conclusion Systematic analysis of Eliade's work has proved Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza's assertion that a feminist critical approach requires more than the concession of certain facts or hypotheses. Eliade concedes many of the facts and hypotheses that structure the feminist view of ancient Goddess religion. But because his view of the nature, origin, and history of religion is deeply androcentric, he cannot present a coherent picture of ancient Goddess religion. To do so would require a shift in the androcentric paradigm through which he understands religion. In his discussion of Paleolithic and Neolithic religions, Eliade is forced by the nature of the evidence to pay more attention to the social and material bases of religious ideas than he does in his discussions of religions for which texts exist. However, androcentric bias is found in his universalization of the religious significance of hunting rituals, the projectile weapon, blood sacri fice and communion, and the male Supreme Being. His inability to compre hend the meaning or the overall significance of symbolisms associated with the female body, including the "female figurines" and the burial rituals, can be attributed to his assumption that women and female symbolism represent the particular (men, the universal), and to his conception of the sacred as standing in opposition to the flux of life. In addition Eliade states that the hierarchical relation of the sexes not only stems back to Paleolithic times, but is one of the essential characteristics of humanity. This judgment makes it difficult for him to accept that religion may have been created at least in part by women, or to understand how female symbolism could represent the universal. Moreover, the assumption of male dominance renders questions about the relative power of women and men in religion uninteresting. Eliade admits that in the Neolithic women and feminine symbolism are "raised to the first rank," but he fails to develop a unified picture of Neolithic religion. This can be attributed to his inability to fit a religion centered around female imagery and perhaps created in large part by women, into his overall picture of religion as primarily a male affair, a recapitulation and transformation of the religious ideas of the Paleolithic hunters. In his chapter on classical Greek religion, Eliade mentions the violent destruction of pre-Indo-European peoples, cultures, and religions. But while feminist scholars are saddened by the overthrow of peaceful and egalitarian agricultural societies in which women were not subordinate, Eliade valorizes the warriors and associates their conquest and brutal de</page><page sequence="20">94 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion struction of land, animals, and people with the religious values he attributes to the Paleolithic hunters. He shows no interest in the survival of pre-Indo European religious patterns in Greek religion. He does not ask how the Indo-European conquests and the establishment of warfare as a way of life changed religion and society and affected the roles and relations of women and men. The history of religion which Eliade tells is distorted by dualism, Idealism, and false universalization of male experience. The guiding princi ple of his work is at once a longing for the transcendent and a glorification of bloodshed and warfare. Once this bias is unmasked, we can never again read his work, or others like it, as a "true" or "objective" telling of the history of religion. As scholars begin to reconceptualize the origins and history of religion, the following points should be borne in mind: it must not be assumed that religion is always an attempt to escape the flux of life; religious ideas must be understood in the context of social and political power, that is, the history of religion must be fully historical; understanding women's and men's power, participation, and leadership in religion and society is part of the context in which religious ideas must be understood; male experience is not the norm, nor female experience, the deviation; patriarchy is not universal; later reaffir mations of religious ideas may be as much the result of power politics as of intrinsic validity; androcentric literary sources must not be trusted as provid ing the only or the most reliable evidence about the past; the history of religion must begin at the beginning, with the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras. Attention to these issues would begin to redress the androcentric biases which have shaped understanding, and will restore to women the knowledge of an empowering history.</page></plain_text>
