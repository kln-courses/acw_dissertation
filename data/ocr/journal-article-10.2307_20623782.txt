<plain_text><page sequence="1">wonderful gift for enthusiasts of either mo toring or photography. It is about Ireland's earliest motorists and their automobiles from 1896 through 1906 and contains over a hundred photographs, most of which have not previously been published. All of them are well captioned and indexed. The pic tures bring to life for us a pioneering age of beautiful cars and their very elegant drivers and passengers?an age when few owned cars and took great delight in them, an age when people dressed up to drive! There is a huge wealth of historical and technical in formation for the knowledgeable and a chronology of motoring in Ireland which is factual and informative. This is the first written history of the early days of motor ing in Ireland. The research was clearly ex tensive and the final product is delightful. Dorothea Lange's Ireland. Gerry Mullins. Aurum Press. 120 pp Stg?14.95 pb 25x25 cm 1-85410-567-1. This is my personal favourite. Dorothea Lange (1895-1965) was a pioneering pho tographer best known for her work during the American depression. She visited Ire land in 1954 to photograph the rural society and, based in Ennis, set out to create "a portait of the country itself, its population, its customs, its mores, its atmospheres, the texture of its life". What she has left us is a wonderfully atmospheric social commen tary of the fifties. Her photographs are evocative and dramatic and yet feature or dinary people in very ordinary situations. Anyone who lived in the fifties will have a gloriously nostalgic time looking through this book. It is also a must for students of photography or those of us who simply enjoy and delight in another's artistic achievement. Irish Towns : a guide to sources. Rion ach N\ Neill et al. Geography Publications. 240 pp ?9.95 pb 30 x 21 cm 0-906602-31-0 The good, the bland and the ugly Teresa Doran and friends What do you think of children's books these days?" challenged the fa ther of one of my young reviewers. Before I had a chance to respond, he told me what he thought. "Bland, most of them. Too much political correctness." I pondered on this. Maybe he had a point. Too often chil dren's books are bound to conform to a certain adult-instigated ethos. Professing to reflect the lives of young people, they are nevertheless intent (to a large extent) on educating their readers to a higher moral ideal and in the process pussy-footing around the darker margins of children's psyche. I decided to consider this particular bunch in the light of his statement. Terror on the Burren. Re ? Laighleis. Moinin, Ballyvaughan, Co Clare. 124 pp ?5.99 pb 0-9532777-0-4._ Nothing bland here, and certainly not po litically correct in that there is no guarantee of the good guys winning. In places the tale is downright ugly, in its slow-motion, cine matic depiction of fighting to the death. "Suddenly the pain gripped all his inner organs at one time. His body heaved up wards, pivoted on his shoulders and his heels, and the chieftain of Loch Reasc emit ted a final cry of surrender. And he was gone. Gone." At times I was reminded of C. S. Lewis' The Last Battle from the Narnia series, with is similar amalgam of the realistic and the fantastic. Terror on the Burren is a powerful elemental saga, with a heady mix of brutish power, the supernatural and pure poetry. "The streams of colour ran like snakes across her body, causing shadows to caress her face and head." The limestone Burren of West Clare, with mysticism embedded in its untamed wil derness, is a spectacular setting in itself, but to ground the tale in a pre-Christian era adds an extraordinary new dimension. Ad mittedly I was sceptical at the presumptive nature of the first line, "It is the year 200 BC," but once over that hurdle, the use of the present tense immediately ensnares the reader. Here we have the story of small hunter gathering family settlements, and their dealings with a nearby tribe of marauding barbarians. But more fearsome than the Barbeys is the legend of the black beast that stalks the Burren. Something so evil it needs no motive to exact revenge. In its original Irish form Terror on the Burren was the winner of the Se?n ? hfiigeartaigh commemorative award and the Bisto Book of the Year merit award. This excellent translation will doubtless bring it to the wider audience it deserves. Allison : a story of first love. Tatiana Strelkoff. O'Brien Press. 158 pp ?5.99 pb 0-86278-559-6._ Therese, aged 17. writes: When I read the short summary on the back of this novel, I was intrigued. Finally, a novel on current issues which affect every teenager's life. Before starting, I have to admit, I was prepared to love this novel. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I ex pected it to be. It was too short; it would have been a much better novel if it were longer. I liked the opening paragraph, but then it jumped straight to Karen falling in love with Allison. I feel it would have been better if it took a good while for the pair of them to fall in love with each other. How ever I do like the way Karen tries to fight her</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND Decemberl998 feelings by pretending to date a boy but again I feel this should have been empha sised more. A very young teenager could read and enjoy this book, as the text isn't too heavy and it's short, but being the age I am (17), I felt it was slightly childish. The theme of a lesbian accepting her true self is quite adult, but it wasn't really that descriptive and I would have enjoyed it more it went into more detail. It is difficult to say what age-group it would be suitable for. I, myself felt it was subtle enough for young people to read, but some parents mightn't like their young 13-year-old daughters reading about lesbians. It's worth a read as the text is quite good, Karen has to deal with peer prejudice and parental opposition. For her this love is pure torture, but changing it is pure impossible. Can she remain true to herself and find happiness? I won't spoil the story by telling you. I'd give the novel 6 or 7 out of ten. Fast-Wing : the adventures of a blue winged teal. Se?n Kenny. Wolfhound Press. 174 pp 3.99 pb 0-86327-547-8. I was not expecting to enjoy this book. From the holy perspective of all things green and this time the mouthpiece of a duck, I was expecting yet another tirade upon the aw fulness of humankind. Man's vile habits of land clearance and pollution and his spec tacular ignorance of nature's varied fauna, is a favourite hobby-horse of writers, deter mined to subliminally educate our children into becoming conscientious and caring adults. Such anthropomorphism is becom ing tired and lacks the sheer energy of Kipling's Rikki Tikki Tavi and its like. Sean Kenny's novel begins predictably enough, starting from the moment the egg cracks open. From the outset, it is clear that Fast-Wing is an extremely lucid little bird, recounting the incidents of his duckling hood on Pagus Lake. Then at the time of migration, disaster strikes. "I felt a terrible pain. Then I heard a loud noise and I knew it must be a thunderstick." Oh, no, thinks I, here we go again. The poor duck's been shot and now we'll be treated to fervent backlash against hunting. However, I was wrong. The wounding was merely a means to separate Fast Wing from his family, and to set events in train for him to be blown off course in a subsequent storm and to end up on the shores of Ire land, rather than wherever blue wing teal are supposed to go for winter. From the time of the duck's arrival in Ireland, the book takes a different and more interesting tack. True there are the occasional sneak attacks on the disgusting habits of the "busy-people", but most of the time mat ters are entirely avian, and informative to boot. I always thought teal were teal, not realising the rarity of an American blue winged teal in Ireland. As a stranger in a strange land, Fast-Wing launches straight into an identity crisis?as he is not recog nised by the other birds?and cannot find any of his own kind. Treated with kindness by some and suspicion by others, the little duck must use all of his strength and in stinct to survive until spring when he makes his brave solo flight back to his homeland and a hero's welcome. I was sur prised to find my initial scepticism mellow, with this heart-warming tale, aided in no small way by Sean Kenny's deft touches of humour and amusing characterisation of the various birds encountered. One thing puzzled me. If a blue-winged teal is such a rarity in these parts, where were the flash lights, the hides and the inevitable barrage of twitchers? The Sleeping Giant. Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick. Wolfhound Press. 32 pp ?4.99 pb 27x21 cm 0-86327-643-1._ The Long March. Marie-Louise Fitzpa trick. Wolfhound Press. 34 pp ?9.99 hb 29 x 23 cm 0-86327-644-X._ Ms Fitzpatrick is undoubtedly a talented artist. The round-faced, chubby-limbed people in The Sleeping Giant are instantly recognisable from the 'Emma and Joe' books my children enjoyed as school read ers. In contrast the pencil-drawn character studies of The Long March might well be from a different hand altogether. As a chil dren's book, say for the 5-to-10-year-olds, The Sleeping Giant has it all. In the same way that the imagination turns cloud forma tions into fantastic beasts, the story plays with the idea that an island, bearing a re markable likeness to a huge sleeping per son, is actually a giant, who one day wakes up. Giants, even this particularly harmless chap, are a nuisance in that they do tend to step on things and scare people, but it takes the innocent courage of a little girl to sug gest to this poor overgrown being, that he is far more popular as an island A lively text is 355 perfectly complemented by colourful water-colour illustrations full of amusing and off-beat incident. The Long March is altogether a more 'wor thy' work, which however may not have the immediate appeal of The Sleeping Giant. Vivid scenes of Choctaw daily life are memorably portrayed in Ms Fitzpatrick's brilliantly executed pencil drawings, to the extent that they almost eclipse the story itself. This is not the first book to relate the tale of the Long March, and how the Choc taw Indians, in spite of their own meagre resources, managed to raise $170 towards the relief of Ireland's famine, but the retell ing is original. Through the voice of a young Indian boy, we are given an intensely personal view of the sacrifices made?not just in money terms, but in terms of forgive ness?in that the Choctaw give alms to the white men, who to them are the same white men who had forced them from their land. Before the Books Ireland parcel was opened there was war in Doran's. "Bags I the Peter Regan," announced my elder son. "Not fair," remonstrated the younger. "You got it first the last time" A truce was called when the package revealed not one but two of this immensely popular series. Big type and spacing are essential to both younger read ers and reluctant older ones; the story and illustrations are lively enough to keep all ages reading until they run out of daylight!

Peter Re gan. Children's Press. 112 pp ?3.50 pb 1 901737-16-0._ Fabian, aged 13, writes: Riverside v City Slickers is the third book in the series. I have read the first two books, Street League and The Croke Park Conspiracy. I think the Riverside books are fantastic; I think that Peter Regan is a terrific writer, and I enjoy reading his books. He also knows what he is writing about, him being a schoolboys' manager. My favourite char acter in the book is Mad Victor, but I can easily identify with Jimmy, the narrator. Riverside v City Slickers is about Jimmy and his friends. The Riverside football club are not in the Wicklow League, but in the Dub lin league. Jimmy is furious about Chippy stealing his story and winning the book competition, but Chippy has a plan for the prize. Mr Glen has promised the Riverside lads a trip to London if they do well in the Dublin League. Chippy is now playing for the Dublin schoolboys and the Riverside boys. Chippy becomes too big-headed and asks for a transfer to Beesknees United. Mrs O'Leary is out to get Mad Victor and Mad Harry. She gets a surprise when Victor's mum arrives with a husband and a daugh ter. 1 think this book is great and now I have also finished the fourth book, The London Trip. Chippy has trials for Ireland School boys. The trip to London is close and they have a cake sale to raise money, and they even go to Mass! Jimmy's Dad rigs the raffle to win it himself. The Riverside lads try to get money for themselves by holding a raf fle for a bird in a cage, and a guess-the weight competition. Mad Harry becomes "The little green man from Ireland" on the London trip. Harry Hennessy gets arrested and misses the train to Holyhead. Nigger Doyle's uncle becomes Jesus, and there is also a match that's half-football and half rugby?how can that be?! I think this collec tion of books is wonderful, and I enjoyed reading them. I would rate this book 10/10, and I hope that Peter Regan writes lots more books like them. The Cove of Cork. Bill Wall. Mercier Press. 144 pp ?4.99 pb 1-85635-225-0. Now, this is a difficult one. I may be at a disadvantage for not having read either The Powder Monkey or The Slave Coast, the earlier parts of this trilogy, but nonetheless The Cove of Cork is quite easy to get into without any prior knowledge of the earlier books. Definitely for readers with an interest in the maritime, the story is extensively set on board various early nineteenth-century craft: brigs, schooners and man-o'-wars (or should it men o' war?). Donal Long is once again the protagonist, but whereas he was a boy in The Powder Monkey, it is now 1813 and he is a man, the first mate of an Ameri can schooner. This may prove a hurdle for many young readers, who would find it more difficult to identify with a grown-up hero, who now has to take on more adult responsibilities, including facing up to his part in the 1798 Rebellion, and matters of the heart. However, as an older reader, I found it difficult to perceive Donal, or the beauteous Ellen Daunt as anything more than gauche teenagers in their reactions and attitudes to events around them. Equally daunting to a younger reader may be the rather stilted affectation of nineteen century mannerisms and the occasional heavy-handed insertion of historical fact? as when Achilles Daunt, merchant and ship owner, puts his views on the Act of Union: "To be sure, agriculture profits by it, for it is said Ireland is the granary of the Empire. But His Majesty's government has seen fit to tax our industry to death." Bill Wall writes confidently and with knowledge, and will doubtless be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in maritime his tory, who is not put off by the colourful, but essentially childish cover design.</page></plain_text>
