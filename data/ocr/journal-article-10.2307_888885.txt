<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews London and Washington Art nouveau The crowds at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the uniformly favourable press coverage testify to the timeliness of Art Nouveau 1890-1914 (closed 30th July),' its remarkable visual impact, and the suc- cess with which its organiser Paul Green- halgh has communicated his ideas through the sequential design of the show, story boards and a book containing thirty essays by an array of scholars.2 This exhibition is the culmination of a second, scholarly, phase of interest in art nouveau (the first being linked to the rather more febrile atmosphere of 1960s high fashion). The last twenty years have seen ground-breaking publications and the restoration of neg- lected art-nouveau buildings in Barcelona, Glasgow, Brussels and Vienna. The fact that much of the art-nouveau material in the Victoria and Albert Museum was bought one century ago at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle3 gives the exhibition a particular fin-de-smicle relevance, while Greenhalgh's heated, passionately written opening essays in the accompanying book argue persuas- ively for art nouveau as the 'style of the age', resistant to attempts to isolate 'singu- lar meanings and moments' and ill-suited to the 'reductive scrutiny of art-historical scholarship'. Almost immediately, however, problems of style present themselves. We may feel that we know what a general (as opposed to an individual) style is, but, as has often been pointed out, over-persistent investiga- tions often collapse into anthropomorphic metaphor as the style appears to develop a life of its own.4 These problems were largely avoided in the much larger concurrent exhi- bition 1900 at the Grand Palais, Paris.5 1900 covered much of the same ground but was able to cultivate a more accurate period eye by not attempting to define any one style. On the other hand, many will be reassured by the boldness and sweep of the London 7M 27. Fruit basket, designed byJosef Hoffmann. 1904. Silver (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). and Washington exhibition and by the proselytising claims made for art nouveau's r61e as a harbinger of modernity - if not modernism tout court. But, although art nou- veau is here presented as the first concerted attempt to create 'a modern international style based on decoration', this definition works best if we argue, along with Marshall Berman, that an important part of being modern was to be anti-modern.6 Moving from section to section of the exhibition - an intensely pleasurable visual experience - the positives and negatives of Greenhalgh's approach became plain. A splendid introductory array of ten objects including Rend Lalique's Dragonfly woman corsage ornament, a sinuous candelabra in electroplated bronze designed by Henri van der Velde, Otto Eckmann's Five swans tapestry, a highbacked dining chair with a pierced backrail designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and a silver fruit-basket designed by Josef Hoffmann and made by the Wiener Werkstatte (Fig.27) suggest the complexity of sources, intentions and media, as well as the diversity of national and regional contexts and the importance of small, intense groupings of designers. Here the labelling of individual objects was help- ful, but the absence of a proper catalogue is a matter for regret. From a great museum like the Victoria and Albert Museum one expects collaborative scholarship distilled with precision through detailed catalogue entries. And with a subject as complex as art nouveau it is especially helpful to focus on individual objects, if only to keep Hegelian generalisations about the spirit of the age at bay. The main part of the exhibition fell into two parts: 'The Creation of Meaning', deal- ing with sources and influences and 'The Metropolis and the Designer', eight sec- tions focused on individual cities. 'The Cre- ation of Meaning' started with examples of baroque and rococo, Japanese, Islamic and vernacular art presented as sources for groups of art-nouveau objects. No attempt was made to link individual designers with individual inspirational objects. The latter were drawn from the museum's own collec- tions, with the exception of a few examples of folk art from Haslemere Educational Museum. Nonetheless this section raised all kinds of interesting questions about late nineteenth-century design, chiefly to do with the need to reify national and personal iden- tity through style. These processes were put across powerfully at an international level through International Exhibitions, in the bazaar-like metropolitan department stores and through the proliferation of art and design journals. But there was resistance to the idea of a Europe-wide style. A paradox of late nineteenth-century design is high- lighted by regionalised interest in folk art and a particularised French interest in roco- co revival. Both are examples of a marked rejection of cosmopolitanism in what was after all a markedly cosmopolitan moment in the history of consumption.

Less attractively, so does the nationalistic and sometimes poisonously anti-semitic tone of much contemporary writing on design. Sources for art nouveau were further explored in sections on Le Style Anglais, on Symbolism and on nature and evolution. Most British accounts of art nouveau follow Nikolaus Pevsner in seeing a couple of designs by A.H. Mackmurdo, a title-page for his Wren's City Churches and a chair design with a curvilinear pierced back of 1882, as harbingers of the style. These were here included alongside E.W. Godwin's magnifi- cent sideboard of 1867 (how prescient that seems), designs by William Morris and Wal- ter Crane, ceramics by William de Morgan, Rossetti's Beata Beatrix and work which might be seen as both influencing and exemplify- ing art nouveau, such as Voysey's designs for textiles, the silver designs of C.R. Ashbee and the beautifully perverse graphic art of Aubrey Beardsley. The crucial message coming from Eng- land was, however, political and social as well as visual. Morris and Crane argued for the decadence of the portable easel painting while in The Stones of Venice Ruskin had already identified design as a barometer of the health or sickness of a society. It would be hard to overestimate the impact of such ideas, leading young continental artists to meditate on how their work was consumed and by whom. It is perfectly possible to read art-nouveau designers and middlemen as forward-looking entrepreneurs, seeking out new markets, exploiting new techniques and eroticising design through the manipulation and commodification of the female form. But it is also plausible to argue for a series of secessions in which the abolition of the hierarchy of the arts lent itself to the creation of idealised domestic interiors, as places of psychological well-being shared with an equally creative female partner or a group of friends, reinventing techniques like embroidery hitherto gendered female. Because of the way it was organised, Art Nouveau 1890-1914 never quite conveyed the sense of small groups abandoning the fine arts to work as designers, often with the aim of making utopian unified interiors. The early career of the avant-garde Belgian painter Henry van de Velde can stand as exemplary. In the winter of 1892 he took flight to the coastal town of Knocke-sur-Mer where he laboured over an applique hang- ing, La Veillie des anges (Fig.30). This foray into female practice, achieved with the help of an aged aunt, was followed by his cre- ation with his wife Maria of Bloemenwerf as 'une maison-manifeste', utopian dream space and practical home. The exhibition's section on Symbolism, taking in Gauguin and his Nabis followers, and Les Vingt and La Libre Esthetique, the two Belgian exhibi- tion groups with which Van de Velde was involved, might have explored these themes. But the small-scale easel-type paintings and prints selected (despite three remarkable ceramic pieces by Gauguin) hardly convey the wealth of experimentation in the applied arts by Nabi members such as Maurice Denis and Edouard Vuillard, and by Sym- bolists such as Odilon Redon and Gustav Klimt. At the Grand Palais, the matter was properly covered with a marvellous series of ambitious wall decorations and hangings, including Vuillard's extraordinary panels for Dr Vaquez, Klimt's preparatory designs for the dining-room murals at Hoffmann's Palais Stoclet and a hanging designed by the sculptor Aristide Maillol and made in his tapestry studio at Banyuls. But for many the visual heart of this exhi- bition will have been the section on 'Nature' and 'Evolution'. As Paul Greenhalgh argues in an intriguing essay on 'The Cult of % I ME 1 MIN AF A P, ?fM p-, ol- ?ORM MWWM? ............ 31. Blister beetles, designed by Rene Lalique. c. 1903-04.

Nature', 'nature was the single most unifying factor' of the style and one which 'signified modernity'. The intense, vivid engagement of designers all over Europe with nature - taking in cell structures, the symbolism of flowers and the life-cycles of insects (Fig.31) - related to a range of intel- lectual preoccupations. For instance the writings of the glass and furniture designer Emile Gall6 reveal the influence of the sym- bolist literature and theories of the uncon- scious as well as setting out a manifesto for a purely French applied art in the wake of the Franco-Prussian war. The second section of the show, investi- gating the development of the style in eight cities, worked well and was free from the bullet-point lists of influences and sources which characterised the story boards of the first half. But the decision to concentrate on cities as opposed to groups had its draw- backs. A peripatetic figure such as Van de Velde got a bit lost while the artistic colony at Darmstadt dropped from view altogether. The low-key design of the exhibition failed to convey a sense of place as we move from city to city. The exception is the first large section devoted to Paris where the inclusion of Guimard's metro station entrance and a period film of Loie Fuller performing her famous veil dance does the job dazzlingly well. In subsequent displays devoted to Brus- sels, Helsinki, Glasgow, Vienna, Munich, Budapest and New York there was a sur- prising lack of architectural drawings and the focus was essentially domestic. Some cities discussed in the book (Chicago, Bar- celona, Prague, Moscow and Turin) were absent from the exhibition which per- haps explains why we had an art nouveau- exhibition sans Antoni Gaudi and Lluis Domenech i Montaner. But generalisations about art nouveau were satisfyingly prob- lematised by the array ofvery different work by fiercely individualistic designers such as Horta, Mackintosh, Newbery, Hoffmann and Riemerschmidt - a welcome move from the general to the specific. This absorbing exhibition ended rather too abruptly with the glass of Louis Comfort Tiffany in the context of New York. But as Greenhalgh points out, 'endings are often as revealing as beginnings' and the accom- panying book concludes with his thought- provoking essay on the style's demise. His ideas could be relatively easily translated into visual form to create a final section charting the reshaping of ideas about a modern syntax and unity of the arts. It is something which the National Gallery ofArt, Washington might wish to consider before Art Nouveau 1890-1914 arrives at its second venue.
