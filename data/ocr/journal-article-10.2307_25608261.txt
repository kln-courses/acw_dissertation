Email: vanpoolc@missouri.edu key words: Casas Grandes, Cognitive archaeology, Folk taxonomy, Iconography, Semantics, Symbolic analysis, Shamanism A culture 's semantic structure reflects and affects local knowledge (the conceptual structure used to interact with the environment). Archaeological analysis of iconography reflecting folk taxonomies and other aspects of local knowledge will consequently provide insight into many different aspects of past cultures. A methodology for modeling folk taxonomy is introduced. Both Linnaean and folk taxonomies are based on gross morphological traits, creating correspondence between them at the generic-species level. However, differences are likely at higher taxonomic levels and will be portrayed by depictions of "anomalous" taxa at odds with Linnaean taxonomy. Using archaeological context, symbolic associations, and analogy, archaeologists can use these anomalies to determine the underlying semantic connections. We apply this model to Casas Grandes effigies and find that owls, rattlesnakes, coral snakes, and shamans are associated with each other under the semantic domain "night" and are central to Medio period cosmology and leadership. Each culture distinguishes groups of animals and plants as part of a larger conceptual system (Atran 1998; Berlin et al. 1973; Malkin 1962; Marshall 1973; Ottenheimer 2006a). Ethnobiologists such as Seixas and Begossi (2001:108) place these "folk taxonomies" within the broader analysis of local knowledge, which is the conceptual structure used by a group of people to interact with their surroundings. Archaeologists have on occasion sought to understand aspects of Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 65, 2009 Copyright ? by The University of New Mexico 529</page><page sequence="2">530 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH folk taxonomies, most often to address questions that have little to do with the study of local knowledge itself. Southwestern archaeologists, for example, have debated whether images on Classic Mimbres (ad 1000-1150) pottery portray saltwater fish to establish whether Mimbres peoples made long-distance trips to the Pacific Coast, talked with people who had, or used considerable artistic license when depicting local species (Bettison et al. 1999; Jett and Moyle 1986; Thompson 1999). Resolution of this question is important to reconstructing the trade and cultural affiliations of the Mimbres people, but the implications for taxonomy (e.g., saltwater fish vs. freshwater fish, fish vs. birds, fish vs. humans) are not considered. Studying folk taxonomies is valuable in-and-of-itself because they relate to how people conceptually organize their world (Atran 1998; Faunce 2000; Hunn 1982). Cultural perception is codified through local knowledge, which frames the cognitive structures underlying human agency, landscape construction, ecology, and other aspects of ontology. Food taboos, for example, reflect local knowledge and perceptions of edible and inedible foods, which in turn impact subsistence, technology, the construction of social landscapes, social interaction, prestige, the formation of faction and gender distinctions, and a host of other behaviorally significant attributes (Ross 1978). Given that identifying and explaining cultural factors and understanding of the cognitive framework underlying them are primary goals of anthropological archaeology (Renfrew 1994; Taylor 1948; Vinsrygg 1988), research into the structure of local knowledge is fundamental. Put another way, local knowledge, including folk taxonomies, is part of the cognitive framework that people use to organize their behavior and perceptions of the world. As such, it is central to human interaction with the natural environment and the construction of this interaction's social significance. Archaeologists are rarely able to converse with those they study, so reconstructing folk taxonomies and other components of local knowledge presents a significant methodological problem. Iconography provides tremendous potential for the study of past semantics of local knowledge because it sometimes portrays relationships between plants, animals, humans, and behavior. Anthropologists (especially linguists) use ethnosemantics to study culturally specific meanings of symbols and their associations to facilitate these sorts of studies. We start our discussion with a consideration of the naturalistic paradigm as it has been used by archaeologists to illustrate both its strengths and weaknesses as an ethnosemantic technique for reconstructing folk taxonomies. We then discuss how the articulation between material symbols and folk taxonomies can be strengthened using insights from ethnography and linguistics, before applying this framework to help us understand Casas Grandes Medio period (ad 1200-1450) ceramic iconography as a case study. THE NATURALISTIC PARADIGM Iconographic analysis frequently builds on the naturalistic paradigm (Thompson 1999:40), which holds that images are depictions of actual organisms and actions as perceived by the artisan (e.g., a picture of a rabbit drive literally represents</page><page sequence="3">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 531 humans engaged in killing rabbits, as opposed to a metaphorical victory of good over evil or another esoteric theme). Given a strong correlation between imagery and the real world experience, anthropologists can gain insight into actual behavior by analyzing pictures that illustrate this behavior. This approach has been used around the world to study both ancient and modern art. One famous case is the "Hall of the Bulls" in Lascaux Cave (southwest France), whose figures are interpreted as literal images (Bahn 1996). For the most part, treating the Lascaux images naturalistically seems to be appropriate, but such is not always the case; the "Well Scene" in the same cave which shows a bird-headed person being gored by a bison is not interpreted as a literal case of a man with a bird's head being gored. Instead, it is viewed by some researchers as a shamanic representation with figurative or metaphorical meanings (Clottes and Lewis-Williams 1998; Davenport and Jochim 1988). The previously mentioned research on Mimbres ceramic art provides another example of both the power and limitations of the naturalistic paradigm. Jett and Moyle (1986) use body shape, eye size and placement, mouth size and position, the presence of teeth, tail shape, and patterning representative of scales and markings to identify fish species on Mimbres bowls. Underlying this analysis is the premise that the artists typically sought to depict specific animals realistically. They also find that the depicted fish frequently have extra fins or human-like feet (Jett and Moyle 1986:713; see also Bettison et al. 1999:124). Bettison et al. (1999:125) further note anomalies in Mimbres images of various birds, mammals, fish, insects, reptiles, and amphibians, even though they "confidently" identified certain species. Thus, the naturalistic paradigm is considered applicable even when images do not correspond perfectly with their real-life counterparts. Many studies assume that the traits modern biologists use to distinguish plants and animals are the same as those used by aboriginal artists in their folk taxonomies. Atran (1998) argues that the classification of animals using a hierarchical "rank" system based on gross morphological characteristics is a universal human adaptation. Yet traits of depicted creatures often do not perfectly correspond with modern Linnaean taxonomy. Anomalies or mixed traits are often considered unimportant embellishments; indications that the creature is fanciful, spiritual, or mythical; or confounding noise that renders an image unclassifiable (Bettison et al. 1999:125). Regardless of how anomalies are addressed, little consideration is given to why they are present, with the notable exception of shamanic studies of "liminal creatures"?those whose traits span two different "realms" (such as feathered snakes, which combine the birds of the sky and snakes of the ground; F?rst 1998; VanPool and VanPool 2007; Whitley 2001). It is unreasonable to expect folk taxonomies to correlate perfectly with Linnaean taxonomy. Each taxonomic system reflects the local knowledge of the associated group, which in turn will be reflected in images created by that group's artisans. If the naturalist paradigm is applicable (that is, if the artists are trying to accurately depict some culturally defined group of animals or plants), differences between Linnaean taxonomy and the folk taxonomy will be reflected. These differences appear as "anomalies" because they do not perfectly correspond with a Linnaean taxonomic unit. Once this premise is accepted, the differences</page><page sequence="4">532 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH can become a source of additional information about local knowledge, instead of "noise" that is ignored, explained away, or considered a barrier to study. How might researchers determine the taxa reflected in iconography and link those taxa to the underlying conceptual framework? Ethnosemantics is an ideal method for accomplishing this task. ETHNOSEMANTICS Ethnosemantics holds that conceptual categories reflect and create human perceptions of the world. It is most commonly associated with linguistics, where it has its most ardent manifestation in the "New Anthropology" (Agar 1986; Ottenheimer 2006a; Spradley and Mann 1975). Proponents hold that one can construct a "mental map" reflecting a culture's conceptual organization and worldview by determining semantic domains and mapping how (linguistic) symbols relate to one another (Agar 1986; Duranti 1997; Ottenheimer 2006a: 18). Although the more extreme forms of linguistic determinism have been criticized, research by psychologists, linguists, ethnologists, and even archaeologists indicates that humans build hierarchical organizational structures that impact their perception (Atran 1998; Berlin et al. 1973; Hopkins 2006:616). Consequently, semantic studies can provide tremendous insight into human culture (Berlin et al. 1973; Duranti 1997; Hopkins 2006; Ottenheimer 2006a; Robb 1998; Stross 2006). Linguistic ethnosemantic studies typically start by identifying semantic domains using a list of useful words, building a taxonomy reflecting how the words relate, and then performing a componential analysis to show how the words are associated within and among domains. When applied to folk taxonomies, such an approach easily allows the identification of taxonomic groups such as game animals, non-game animals, predators, edible and inedible plants, pests, and so on. Ethnosemantics also allows the identification of taxonomic units at various scales (e.g., "ducks" are part of a larger taxonomic group, "water birds"). Language-based analyses are of little utility to those archaeologists who do not study civilizations with written records. However, as the definition of "semantics" (the study of meaning) indicates, semantic studies are not limited to spoken language. In some cases, archaeologists have uncovered a rich iconographic record of animals, and plants, and their associations with humans. Furthermore, the symbol systems reflected in iconography tend to be highly organized and consistently structured within cultural units (Berlo 1983; Donnan 1975, 1978; Langley 1991; Panofsky 1955; Stross 2006; Weaver 1993:176-79). These images illustrate conceptual structures, which archaeologists can study just as linguists study the structure of language. Such structures may even be the same as in the associated language, given that both originate from the same semantic associations (Stross 2006). There is consequently no theoretical reason why an ethnosemantic approach cannot be applied to iconography to gain insights into conceptual structures. Instead, there is only a practical consideration of whether the surviving iconography is sufficiently rich to be analyzed. Ethnographic research indicates that folk taxonomies have fairly rigid structures, with conceptual domains including plants and animals. Archaeologists</page><page sequence="5">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 533 working throughout the world have identified repertoires of images belonging to these domains (e.g., horses, bovines, reindeer, and red deer typify much of Europe's Paleolithic art). By examining these images and their associations, archaeologists can reconstruct folk taxonomies using the principles of ethnosemantics. If, for example, iconographic reconstructions are detailed enough, archaeologists might be able to identify "introduced" (domesticated) plants and animals, similar to borrowed words, and differentiate them from the remainder of the folk taxonomy. This information will help explain the conceptual role of the domesticates and thereby shed light on the social impact, religious significance, and ecological effects of the added species. Such information can also benefit historical linguistics in that it may act as a proxy for the spread of linguistic traits as well. Hill (2001) argued that the Uto-Aztecan language group spread north as Mesoamerican farmers migrated northward, based on borrowed words, cognates, and dialectic similarities. Continuity in local knowledge among early farmers, and the introduction of icons associated with maize and other domesticates, ought to be recognizable using an ethnosemantic approach to iconography, if Hill is correct. This is only one example of how iconographic analysis and historical linguistics should provide supporting lines of evidence related to local knowledge and other aspects of culture. TYPES OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN FOLK AND LINNAEAN TAXA Raven et al. (1971:1211) observe that Linnaeus's system, which is the foundation for modern biological systematics, is actually a "folk taxonomy." Linnaeus was seeking the divine plan for the world when he originally developed his system (Ereshefsky 1997). Its continued success is based on its usefulness for evolutionary studies. However, there is no necessary conceptual difference between folk and Linnaean classifications. The question becomes, then, how will Linnaean and folk taxonomies differ? Although species are typically defined as groups of individuals who can interbreed and produce viable offspring, actual Linnaean taxonomy uses morphological traits to form an inclusive hierarchical classification. Creatures are differentiated into taxa based on shared characteristics (Lyman and O'Brien 2003:13-50; Mayr 1969; Simpson 1961). In this regard, biological species are "polythetic," meaning that the individual organisms within a species share many but not necessarily all of the defining characteristics (Mayr 1969; Simpson 1959). Folk taxonomies are similar in that they are also framed using a hierarchical framework (e.g., "oak" is a member of the group of "trees"), with the members of the taxonomic units containing similar but not necessarily identical members (Atran 1998). Because native taxonomies differentiate taxa by broad morphological traits, there is often a strong correspondence between Linnaean and other folk taxonomies at the "generic-species" level (Atran 1998:549; Berlin 1992). Creatures as different as cats and dogs are typically perceived as different "genus-species" in both Linnaean and indigenous classifications, which can lead to correspondence among lower-level taxonomic units.</page><page sequence="6">534 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The criteria used to form higher-level taxonomic units can differ considerably, however. For example, the Seri of northern Mexico use "furriness" as the definitive characteristic to identify mammals, and "feathers and the ability to fly" to identify birds (Malkin 1962:54). Bats are furry and they fly, and therefore they belong to neither mammals nor birds (Malkin 1962:54). Differing criteria of classification can lead to substantial differences in the applicable representational symbols, even when there is substantial agreement at the generic-species level. To help understand the form of such differences, Seixas and Begossi (2001:111-13) identified five types of correspondence.1 1. One-to-one correspondence is exact correspondence between a single indigenous taxon and a single Linnaean taxonomic unit. In such cases, Linnaean and indigenous taxa are often defined using similar characteristics. 2. In Over-differentiation Type I, two or more indigenous taxa correspond with a single Linnaean taxonomic unit. It is particularly common when folk taxa differentiate between the life stages of a single species. In Aristotle's taxonomic system, flies and fly larva (maggots) were not part of the same taxon. Also, physical differences (such as the color of a flower) that are unimportant to modern biological classification may be significant in folk taxonomy. 3. In Over-differentiation Type II, two or more indigenous taxa refer to two or more Linnaean taxa, without exact correspondence between the classifications. An example would be the folk taxa "trees" and "shrubs," whose memberships crosscut Linnaean taxa such as the genera Quercus (oaks) and Nothofagus (southern beeches), both of which have trees and shrubs within them. 4. Under-differentiation Type I occurs when a single folk taxon refers to two or more Linnaean species of the same genus (e.g., a general folk category of "ants" that includes two or more species of Atta). (There are 12,000 species of ants.) 5. In Under-differentiation Type II, a single indigenous species refers to two or more Linnaean species from different genera. One example is the undifferentiated folk taxon of "water birds" found among the Pueblos (Tyler 1991). Seixas and Begossi (2001) apply these correspondences to their ethnographic analysis of indigenous taxonomies of Brazilian fishing communities. We argue that they are generally applicable and can be applied, even when using archaeological data. Starting with the premise that the artist will illustrate the general attributes used to define a taxon, it is possible to identify groups of depictions that possess</page><page sequence="7">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 535 specific shared attributes (i.e., that depict the same taxon). The shared attributes distinguish the taxon within the folk taxonomy. Manifestations of the various types of iconographic correspondence are modeled in Table 1 and Figure 1. We merge Under-differentiation Types I and II into a single class because determining whether the folk taxa cross-cut species (Type I) or genera (Type II) seems to us to be of limited utility in archaeological contexts. Others may distinguish between the various levels of under-differentiation as they find them to be analytically useful.

Correspondence Expected pattern with respect to western taxonomies One-to-one correspondence Over-differentiation type I Over-differentiation type II Under-differentiation type I A folk taxon closely parallels field criteria for identifying a defined Western taxonomic unit, typically a species or genus. Two or more folk taxa possess characteristics of a single Western taxon. Two or more folk taxa possess characteristics of two or more Western taxa without a one-to-one correspondence between the folk and Western taxonomies. A folk taxon possesses characteristics of two or more Western taxa. One-to-one correspondence will be reflected by a close correspondence between attributes used to define the folk taxon and a modern species or genus. Most archaeologists who seek to identify particular animals or plants in iconography use this approach (e.g., Bettison et al. 1999; Jett and Moyle 1986). For example, VanPool (2001:81-82) argues that a Casas Grandes bird effigy (Figure 2) represents a killdeer because it possesses seven of the twelve characteristics used by modern biologists to identify killdeers; the remaining attributes (such as the killdeer's distinctive call) cannot be visually depicted. The tight correspondence between the effigy and a single Linnaean taxon would be unlikely with the other types of correspondence.</page><page sequence="8">536 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 2.

Over-differentiation Type I is the depiction of two or more folk taxa that possess characteristics of a single Linnaean taxon (species, genus, family). Differences in association may help distinguish actual over differentiation from simple depictions of the same animal at different stages (e.g., the association of caterpillars and moths with different taxonomic units, such as flowers for caterpillars and moths with the moon, might reflect over-differentiation). Over differentiation Type II reflects the presence of two or more distinct creatures that possess characteristics of two or more Linnaean taxa (e.g., the "duck-killdeer" discussed below). Under-differentiation will be reflected by an iconographic taxon that shares characteristics of two or more Linnaean taxonomic units. VanPool (2003a) identified a coral snake with a tail rattle, which doesn't correspond to a single Linnaean taxonomic unit. Both coral snakes and rattlesnakes are present in the Casas Grandes region, so we doubt that the artists didn't understand that coral snakes lack rattles, and that rattlesnakes lack red, black, and white stripes. Instead they chose to portray some connection between the animals that is under-differentiated relative to modern biological taxonomy. Three emic factors complicate the application of our model to iconography. First, there may be differences in the number and type of characteristics used to portray folk taxa. Some animals and plants are distinctive and can be identified by a limited number of attributes. Scorpion tails, the macaw's upper mandible, and the datura plant's pods are all unique. Representations of scorpions, macaws, or datura could be quite abstract as long as the primary distinguishing characteristic is recognizable. In contrast, some taxa overlap considerably in appearance, requiring the detailed representation of many traits to distinguish them taxonomically. VanPool (2001) provides an example of such differences in the detail of representations. She found that macaws and a killdeer are represented on a single Casas Grandes effigy pot (Figure 2). Following Di Peso et al. (1974[6]:99), VanPool (2001:85) proposes that macaws are represented by an abstract "P" motif composed of an overarching mandible attached to representations of tail feathers. In this case, the macaw's beak is so distinctive that attributes beyond a</page><page sequence="9">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 537 "feathered macaw beak" are unnecessary to allow a correct identification; no other feathered animal has a similar beak. In contrast, the killdeer is far less distinctive. As a result, the killdeer image is intricately formed and decorated to replicate the killdeer's markings, body proportions, head and beak shape, and even behavior (broken wing display to lure predators from its nest). The second complicating issue is stylistic embellishment of naturalistic designs. Artisans may choose to include additional decorations beyond the traits necessary to represent taxa. As anybody who has viewed a walking cow in a Far Side cartoon can testify,2 such embellishment is not problematic to those familiar with local knowledge (meaning the definitive attributes of a folk taxon), but it does present a problem for archaeologists who may not be able to distinguish between elements meant to define the taxon from those that are simply decorative. Bettison et al. (1999:121) illustrate this difficulty when they observe that they were at times uncertain whether decorative elements on Mimbres pots should be interpreted as scales, feathers, or something else. Designs that are meant to be diagnostic versus those that are decorative must be differentiated on a case-by-case basis, but we have several suggestions for archaeologists studying folk taxa. Species determination should ideally be completed using multiple characteristics. It is possible that some stylistic embellishment will look to a Linnaean taxonomist like the characteristics of a particular plant or animal, but it is less likely that such chance correspondences will be present in multiple characteristics. The distinctiveness of the design may also help determine whether it is representational or an embellishment. In an art style that frequently uses hatching to decorate an animal, such a design is more likely to be an embellishment than the same hatched design would be in an artistic tradition that rarely uses it. Finally, the naturalistic paradigm is not always applicable. Depictions of plants and animals may not represent taxa in a folk taxonomy, just as unicorns are not included in biological classifications. Carr (1979:16) suggests that the four appendages on some Mimbres fish do not correspond with any particular species of fish, but instead symbolize Pueblo myths in which people were transformed into fish. If so, the fins should not be used to identify the species. Non-naturalistic depictions will likely be characterized by repeated attributes that do not correlate with any biological taxa, or traits of different species or genera that are arranged in ways that do not occur in the real world (e.g., a winged horse). Such images perhaps can be differentiated from naturalist depictions of under-differentiated folk taxa, which will also be represented by combinations of characteristics of two or more species or genera (Table 1), by the nature of the combinations, the degree of correspondence with the species and animals, and the context of the decoration. A winged horse could represent a mythical creature or a folk taxon that includes both birds and horses. The combination of birds and horses into a single taxon would be odd, however, because of their tremendous morphological and behavioral differences. Likewise, the association of the winged horse with other potentially mythic beasts and warriors suggests that the image is referring to a non-natural creature. By the same token, the Casas Grandes horned serpent could reflect a folk taxon in which birds and serpents are</page><page sequence="10">538 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH combined into a single group, or it could reflect a non-naturalistic depiction of a cosmologically significant entity. The combination of snakes and birds into a single taxon would be odd, given that they do not share significant morphological or behavioral similarities, and specific depictions suggest a conceptual context outside of everyday experience (e.g., the horned serpent is shown interacting with macaw-headed anthropomorphs). This is not to say that the Casas Grandes people did not believe in horned serpents in the same way as they believed in the macaws they raised by the hundreds. Nonetheless, the images of horned serpents cannot be interpreted using the naturalistic paradigm, and attempts to identify natural species will be unsuccessful. Applications of the naturalistic paradigm must be defended on a case-by-case basis. We now turn our attention to the folk taxonomy of the Casas Grandes people. DEPICTIONS OF MEDIO PERIOD CASAS GRANDES CREATURES During the Medio period (ad 1200-1450), a new political and religious system swept across the Casas Grandes region centered in northwest Mexico. This system most likely represents the most hierarchical society in the prehistoric North American Southwest (Minnis et al. 2006; Rakita 2001). Large villages were built along the Rio Casas Grandes, the Rio Santa Maria, and nearby streams. The largest settlement, Paquime, was a pueblo-like town with platform mounds, I-shaped ballcourts, and more Mesoamerican goods than anywhere else in the Southwest (e.g., two tons of ocean shells and a greater variety and quantity of copper items than found anywhere else in the Southwest). Paquime likely housed more than 2,500 people and served as an economic and religious center for the Medio period (Di Peso 1974; Fish and Fish 1999; Harmon 2006; Lekson 1999; Phillips 1989; Rakita 2006). The Medio period was typified by finely made tan pottery with red and black painted designs, the Casas Grandes polychromes. These ceramics were integral to the political and religious system and conveyed information important to the creation and maintenance of Medio period culture (Di Peso 1974; Riley 2005; Schaafsma 1999, 2000a; Sprehn 2001, 2003; VanPool 2003b; VanPool and VanPool 2007). We have collected images of more than 2,000 Chihuahuan polychrome pots to explore the cultural framework they reflect (see VanPool 2003a). Effigies and painted figures provide realistic representations of humans and animals and reveal significant symbolism, themes, and ritual activities (Braniff 1999; Di Peso 1974; Narez 1991:20; Sprehn 2001,2003; VanPool 2001, 2003a, 2003b; VanPool and VanPool 2002, 2006a, 2007). Effigies are rare (193 out of 2,000 vessels) and effigies of non-humans are even less frequent (n - 68), but effigies and painted images of snakes and birds occur often enough to represent a recognizable group (n = 83; 25 painted horned serpents, 21 snake effigies, and 37 bird effigies). Fish (n = 4), mountain sheep (n = 3), and lizards (n = 1) are also portrayed in effigy (VanPool 2003a; VanPool and VanPool 2007). When bird and snake effigies are depicted they are remarkably consistent, so much so that they create a redundant sample. Although the sample size is small, its consistency reveals the nonrandom association of specific attributes</page><page sequence="11">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 539 and indicates that the variation in our sample reflects the underlying variation (VanPool and VanPool 2006b, 2007). We have elsewhere argued that selection of the animals depicted in effigy emphasized liminality, especially creatures associated with the underworld/ lower world division that was central to Casas Grandes shamanism (VanPool and VanPool 2007). Animals that were locally available but not associated with shamanic practice were rarely if ever portrayed in effigy or even as painted designs. Turkeys were raised and ritually sacrificed by the hundreds, for example, but are nearly absent in the iconography, as are most common game animals. In contrast, wild birds such as owls (which are not common in Paquime's faunal assemblage; Di Peso et al. 1974[8]), which are associated with the night across the Americas, are represented as effigies (n = 8). The consistent selection of a limited number of animals, especially birds and snakes, for representation as effigies indicates their importance and some sort of association within the larger symbolic system. The exact nature of this association is consequently a central issue for understanding both Casas Grandes art and the Medio period cosmological system. Put another way, identifying the species of birds and serpents reflected in the iconography and their placement in local knowledge is more than an esoteric study of a trivial point. It provides information about Medio period culture that would otherwise be unobtainable. Furthermore, identifying which species are represented is merely a starting point. Understanding the social significance of these species requires that taxonomic associations and conceptual relations be explored. It is exactly this task that an ethnosemantic approach is suited to accomplish. Here we apply an ethnosemantic perspective, and we find that owl and snake effigies reflect a taxonomic emphasis on nocturnal predators associated with Casas Grandes shamanism. Owls Among the various birds depicted are killdeer (n = 1), duck-like birds (n = 2), and macaws (n = 38; VanPool and VanPool 2007). Following the naturalistic paradigm, distinguishing characteristics used in Linnaean taxonomy were considered (e.g., crown, eye shape, eye line, median line, eyebrow line). Based on our ability to identify bird representations using such characteristics, it appears that Casas Grandes artists used traits similar to those used in Linnaean classification to distinguish birds (especially head shape, beak shape, and sometimes coloration, which are easily depicted on ceramic effigies and are recognizable from a distance). Owl effigies, like most Casas Grandes polychrome effigies, are globular jars topped with heads (Figures 3 and 4). Owls are characterized by distinctive head and face morphology, including large eyes and a heart-shaped rim (or facial disk) that gives the effigies the "bounded" look definitive of owls. Two families of owls, horned (Strigidae\ n = 3) and barn (non-horned) (Tytonidae; n = 5), are represented. Horned owls have oval faces. Scott Cutler (personal communication, 2000), a professional ornithologist and curator at Centennial Museum, University of Texas-El Paso, reports that barn owls are the only owls that have heart-shaped faces. Furthermore, one of the effigies has a speckled face, which is strikingly</page><page sequence="12">540 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH similar to the facial markings of barn owls (Figure 4). Representations of horned and barn owls suggest a one-to-one correspondence between Casas Grandes folk taxa and Tytonidae (barn owls) and Strigidae (horned owls; the most common local species is the great horned owl, Bubo virginianus, though other species are present in the area). To provide a semantic domain, owls are mainly nocturnal birds of prey that use their powerful talons and beaks to hunt insects, fish, small reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. They also have exceptional vision and hearing and are able to fly silently (Johnsgard 1988). Amerindian local knowledge about owls differs from group to group. The Zuni value owls as strong birds of prey that bring critical information to war chiefs (such as the location of enemies), and they use their feathers for prayer sticks (Ladd 1963; Roberts 1932:151). Other Pueblo groups associate owls with the dead and consider them very dangerous (Tyler 1991). Given that owls are depicted on Casas Grandes pottery, it is unlikely that the Paquimeans had prohibitions against them. Instead, they may have had ritual significance, as they do among the Zuni. We argue below that their significance derived in large part from the fact that they are nocturnal predators. Snakes Charles Painter, the State of New Mexico herpetologist, helped us identify snakes on the pottery in 2003. Herpetologists primarily use the number and shape of the scales, presence or absence of a rattle, head and body morphology, and markings such as the color and order of bands to identify snakes (Degenhardt et al. 1996:251-54; Stebbins 1985:2, 24-32). Casas Grandes artists appear to have done likewise, especially relying on the presence or absence of rattles and the color and order of bands to differentiate taxa. With Painter's help we identified western coral snakes (Micruroides euryxanthus, n = 2), Sonoran Mountain kingsnakes/New Mexico milksnakes (Lampropeltis pyromelana/L. triangulum, n = 3) and a rattlesnake (Crotalus sp., n = 1) on Casas Grandes effigy vessels. Other snake effigies (n = 39) could not be assigned to a specific Linnaean taxon. The western coral snake was represented by combinations of red, black, and white bands (Figure 5) and is differentiated from the superficially similar looking kingsnake/milksnake by the order of the bands (Figure 6). The highly venomous coral snake has red bands bordered by yellow or white bands, whereas the non venomous kingsnake and milksnake (two closely related species) are characterized by black bands alternating with red and white bands. (This difference is codified in the folk adage "Red touch yellow, kill a fellow; red touch black, friend of Jack" [Degenhardt et al. 1996:338].) The close correspondence between the Casas Grandes effigies and coral snakes suggests a one-to-one correspondence. The western coral snake is found today in central Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and south into southern Sinaloa (Degenhardt et al. 1996:338). It lives in a variety of habitats, including brushland, grassland, and farmland, and is largely nocturnal, spending most of the day underground (Degenhardt et al. 1996:338; Stebbins 1985:223). People living in the western and northern portion of the Casas Grandes region would have encountered these snakes at night, after rainstorms, and on cloudy days.</page><page sequence="13">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 541 Figure 3.

The rattlesnakes have molded bodies decorated with large, repeating black triangular/diamond designs and ticking to indicate rattles. The snakes also have the triangular heads indicative of vipers (Stebbins 1985:225). Although they lack the distinctive black and white tail rings of the western diamondback (Degenhardt et al. 1996:341; Stebbins 1985:Plate 44), the effigies correspond closely with western diamondback rattlesnakes, suggesting a one-to-one correspondence between the folk taxon and Crotalus atrox. The western diamondback rattlesnake lives in mountain forests, prairies, shrub-covered sand dunes, and the desert edge (Degenhardt et al. 1996:342; Stebbins 1985:231) and can be found across most of the American Southwest and northern Mexico. Travelers in the Casas Grandes region would have encountered them frequently, and their bites can be fatal (Degenhardt 1996:342; Stebbins 1985:224-26). Although they are often encountered during daylight hours, they are nocturnal hunters for most of the year and eat a wide variety of mammals, including rats, pocket gophers, rabbits, and rock squirrels (Degenhardt et al. 1996:343). The frequent representation of snakes suggests they were an important taxonomic class in Casas Grandes local knowledge, which is consistent with ethnographic and historical records from the Southwest and Mesoamerica. People throughout these regions considered snakes to be powerful creatures associated Figure 7. Western diamondback rattlesnakes with coral snakes (see Figure 5).

Coral snakes with rattle tail. Courtesy of El Paso Museum of Archaeology, El Paso (Catalog No. W81-10-5). with leadership and social differentiation (Miller and Taube 1993:148-50; Slifer 2000:112-13). Mesoamerican lords, priests, and gods were commonly depicted as being born out of serpents' mouths (Miller and Taube 1993). Mesoamerican and Southwestern leaders and priests organized snake dances and called on the power of snakes (Baudez 1992; Miller and Taube 1993; Slifer 2000). Parsons (1996:927, 415-16) reports that at Isleta, Pa/ide (an executive for the town chief) derived his authority from a rattlesnake named Ikaina, and that Zuni warriors rubbed their faces with rattlesnake oil so their enemies would fear them in the same way that they fear snakes. Parsons (1996:1043) also reports that the Hopi warriors tipped their arrows with venom from kept rattlesnakes, a common practice among many native North American groups (Jones 2007:32^13). Snakes and lightning are closely linked by many Mesoamerican and American Southwestern groups, especially among the Aztecs, Pueblo people, and Navajos (Miller and Taube 1993:106; Parsons 1996: 927; Schaafsma 2000b:141; Slifer 2000:113; Smith 1952:214; Switzer 1969:42; Tyler 1964:235). Snakes/rain/lightning make barren fields fertile (Stephen 1936:737-38; see also Slifer 2000:113-14) but can also be lethal in the form of a lightning strike or a venomous snake (Schaafsma 2000b:141; Slifer 2000:113-14). Deadly snakes/ lightning were considered a supernatural weapon of the War Gods and were often associated with war and the War Chiefs (Crotty 1995:213-18; Parsons 1996:927, 931; Schaafsma 2000b: 141; Slifer 2000:113; Smith 1952:214; Switzer 1969:42; Tyler 1964:235). Given the contexts of serpent images on pottery, including mortuary vessels that contained elite burials at Paquime (VanPool and VanPool 2007:77-78),</page><page sequence="17">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 545 and similar conceptual associations in groups both north and south of the Casas Grandes region, we suggest that the Casas Grandes serpents were associated with ancestors, leaders, lightning, rain, water, and perhaps war, and were important in rituals related to rainmaking and fertility. The depiction of a "rattled coral snake" and paired rattlesnake/coral snake effigies on the same pot indicate a conceptual association between rattlesnakes and coral snakes that make them distinct from other snakes. In particular, Casas Grandes artisans took care to distinguish coral snakes from milksnakes and kingsnakes, despite similarities in coloration, indicating that the connection between the rattlesnake and coral snake must rest on something other than being in the taxon "snakes." The fact that they are both venomous provides an obvious basis for this connection. In the context of the Casas Grandes imagery, which includes other creatures, this connection was strengthened by the fact that both are deadly nocturnal predators. Most snake effigies (n = 39) do not have recognizable characteristics of specific taxa, suggesting that "snakes in general" was significant in local knowledge. The taxon could in fact be "snake/lightning." If so, both the taxon "snake/lightning" and the taxon "venomous nocturnal snakes" are cases of Under-differentiation Type II correspondence (animals from different genera combined into a single folk taxon). Given the apparent importance of owls, the fact that coral snakes and rattlesnakes are deadly nocturnal predators may have contributed to their importance to the Casas Grandes people. From a semantic domains perspective it appears that the organizing principle at work is nocturnal predator. This emphasis articulates with the possibility of shamanism previously identified for the Medio period remains (VanPool and VanPool 2007). SHAMANS AND NIGHT We have previously argued that tobacco shamanism is at the core of Casas Grandes iconography and that most of the imagery found on polychrome vessels is tied to shamanic themes (VanPool 2003b; VanPool and VanPool 2007). In a seminal study of South American tobacco use, Wilbert (1987:166-71) found that nicotine intoxication causes the pupils to dilate, making the shamans much more sensitive to light. As a result, tobacco shamans find the bright light of the midday sun uncomfortable and tend to be more active at dusk, dawn, and night. Wilbert (1987:171) also found that some South American shamans exacerbate this effect by dropping tobacco juice in their eyes to further dilate them and increase their night vision. These shamans travel during twilight hours and were conceptually associated with darkness. Many New World societies organize the cosmos using dualistic principles in complementary opposition (Bonvillain 2001; Hays-Gilpin 2000; Joyce 1996; Taube 1993:16). These commonly include men/women and day/night. Taube (1993:16) reports that nighttime is related to mythic time and is when ancestors, gods, and demons awake. Across Mesoamerica and the American Southwest, nighttime is when shape-shifters, such as were-jaguars, witches, and skinwalkers, come out to cause trouble (Kluckhohn 1944; Lumholtz 1986; Taube 1993).</page><page sequence="18">546 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Because the ancestors and gods are awake and active, it is also when mortals most easily communicate with them using hallucinogens or through dreams, making nighttime the preferred time for shamanic activity (Taube 1993:16). We have no means of determining whether Casas Grandes shamans put tobacco juice directly in their eyes, but there are clear indications that they smoked in dark places. Nine stone pipes identical to the small cylinders that smoker effigies hold (VanPool 2003b) were found at Paquime. Seven of the pipes were found in the side rooms of the House of the Walk-in Well (Di Peso et al. 1974[7]:305-6), along with two "shamanic caches" (jars with mineral concretions, quartz, and small fetishes) and a large jar with depictions of two shamans (VanPool and VanPool 2007). The pipes indicate that smoking was an important part of ritual behavior at Paquime, not just an activity portrayed on pots, and their association with shamanic caches and the olla decorated with shamans indicates that smoking rituals and other shamanic activity were associated with the House of the Walk-in Well. Smoking, pipes, and shamanic caches and iconography at the House of the Walk-in Well constitute an "iconic family" that, according to Knight (1986:676), is a "set of sacra particularly associated with a corresponding cult institution."3 The well itself is the deepest and darkest feature at Paquime. The placement of the shamanic sacra further emphasizes the connection between shamanism and darkness, especially when shamans were intoxicated. The Medio period Casas Grandes shamans consequently appear to have followed the broader Mesoamerican patterns of being associated with the night and using darkness to help them communicate with their deities (Taube 1993:16), just as the Medio period people adopted other aspects of Mesoamerican architecture, ritual, and trade. Death and darkness are closely associated throughout Mesoamerica and the Southwest (Taube 1993). Wilbert (1987:156) has argued that shamans derive their power from their ability to metaphorically "die," thereby allowing their spirit to travel to the other world (see also Boyd 1996:156). VanPool (2003b) argues that Casas Grandes shamans were literally thought to die and revive themselves. Given the close connection among shamanism, darkness, and death, animals associated with these features gained special cosmological significance because of their overlapping conceptual domains. Nocturnal predators such as rattlesnakes, owls, and coral snakes thus were conceptually, and perhaps even linguistically, connected with the Casas Grandes shamans. This explains why effigies that are dominated by depictions of shamans also include animals with no obvious economic or ritual importance. Their conceptual significance is derived from cultural associations that are not reflected in a Linnaean classification. DISCUSSION Shamans, rattlesnakes, coral snakes, and owls may look and act very differently, but following a taxonomic approach we found that night was a fundamental semantic domain reflected in Casas Grandes iconography. If that is correct, there should be additional evidence linking nocturnal plants and animals with each other. Indeed, there is. Serpents and Medio period shamans share distinctive icons, for example. Running circles used to decorate the backs of western diamondback</page><page sequence="19">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 547 rattlesnake effigies (and which likely represent the "diamonds" of the snakes) are depicted on sashes worn by shamans. We have argued that these sashes are symbolic representations of snake skins, thus signs of power or authority (VanPool and VanPool 2007:127-30). Given conceptual associations of night, death, and shamanism, the reason rattlesnakes are associated with shamanic leaders becomes clear. Another manifestation of the link between shamans and nocturnal snakes is a transformed shaman who has a rattlesnake's rattle and feathers protruding from his head (Figure 9). This combination suggests that the shaman is becoming a rattled bird, perhaps indicating that he, like shamans everywhere, uses the power of tutelary creatures. Figure 9. Shaman with rattle coming out of his head. Courtesy of El Paso Centennial Museum, University of Texas at El Paso (Catalog No. A 36.85.18). A possible iconographic association between owls and shamans is provided by a couple of anthropomorphic owls that may be transformed shamans. The bodies of these vessels are decorated with interlocking geometric designs but lack the emblems of Casas Grandes shamanism (i.e., pound signs, circles with dots, and diamonds with ticking that follows entopic images per Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988; see VanPool and VanPool 2007). Other represented animals occur in small frequencies and likely had lesser roles, if any, in the system of night that dominated the Medio period symbolism. We are not suggesting that these and other animals were not ritually important. Many of them clearly were. For example, bone troves found in ritual contexts contain remains of such large and powerful animals as mountain lions, bears, and bison (Di Peso et al. 1974[8]:59). Furthermore, the hundreds of headless turkey burials found in the House of the Dead suggest this large bird was also ritually important (Di Peso et al. 1974[8]:290-305, 387, 392-93). However, their significance likely did not originate from shamanism or night symbolism (which we have suggested are linked).</page><page sequence="20">548 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Further, the night semantic domain was integrated with other domains, possibly including gender, life, and day. We have demonstrated that male effigies (especially shamans) are associated with snakes and horned serpents, whereas female effigies are associated with macaws and other birds (VanPool and VanPool 2006b). Given that serpents and shamans are associated with the night whereas macaws are associated with the day and the sun (Miller and Taube 1993; Parsons 1996; Thompson and Brown 2006; Tyler 1991), the semantic domain of gender may include the association of males with darkness, death, and shamanism and women with daytime and life. CONCLUSIONS The semantic-based approach illustrated here provides archaeologists a means for studying a culture's worldview. Where linguists discover "key words" and semantic domains and relationships, and then build their taxonomy to reflect worldview, archaeologists (and art historians too) can observe the semantic domains reflected through material symbols. Using these images and their correspondences, semantic domains can be identified and archaeologists can build a taxonomy reflecting the core cosmological concepts of the groups we study. We believe that this formal structure is a better means of identifying and testing hypotheses than is possible using a less structured, ad hoc approach to iconographic analysis. Most archaeological iconographic studies employ a methodology based largely on Panofsky's (1955) approach focused on understanding iconography within its cultural context. In general, though, the relationships identified using this approach tend to focus on "naming" icons (e.g., large goggle eyes represent Tlaloc). Missing is an overarching framework that will allow the relationships between various icons to be mapped and tested. A semantic-based approach provides this structure. In this case, it has provided a means of systematically recording and interpreting depictions and their correspondence with Linnaean taxonomy that wouldn't be otherwise possible, and it has allowed us to identify conceptual associations that can be evaluated through additional lines of evidence. Although Casas Grandes iconography does not appear to involve writing, an ethnosemantic approach has provided invaluable insight into the conceptual constructs of the Casas Grandes craftspeople. We have proposed that shamanism is the organizing principle in Medio period Casas Grandes art (VanPool 2003a, 2003b; VanPool and VanPool 2006b, 2007), but until recently, we lacked the conceptual structure for explaining why shamans were associated with certain animals. Nor could we explain why animals that otherwise seem incidental (at best) to the lives of Medio period inhabitants (e.g., owls) were emphasized at the expense of animals central to Medio period life (e.g., turkeys). The solution to our quandary is the semantic domain of night/nocturnal as reflected in Medio period local knowledge. The Casas Grandes Medio period imagery considered here focuses on nocturnal predators, including owls and venomous snakes. The folk taxa reflected at the generic species level correspond closely with the Linnaean classification of these animals, but their conceptual associations are quite different than those</page><page sequence="21">THE SEMANTICS OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 549 typical in modern Linnaean analysis. Rattlesnakes and coral snakes were linked in a higher taxonomic class that does not correspond to Linnaean taxonomy. Further, these animals were associated with other nocturnal predators?owls? and with a specific group of humans?shamans. Shamans drew their power from, and conceptually reinforced, these domains visually in the Casas Grandes polychromes and in architecture (e.g., the Walk-in Well). These insights into Casas Grandes local knowledge would not have been possible without the use of a semantic approach. This paper is not intended to be exhaustive but rather to provide a starting point for understanding how the material record fits into a larger anthropological discussion of semantics. Our knowledge of Medio period cosmology and its manifestation in local knowledge will be improved through additional considerations of other iconography and archaeological materials. For example, the ritual sacrifice of turkeys and their near absence from Casas Grandes iconography reflects conceptual associations that can also be understood semantically. A semantic-based analysis of turkeys and related materials will help clarify their underlying association with nocturnal predators/shamans. The same is true for water birds, women and macaws, and various other associations we have noted elsewhere (e.g., VanPool and VanPool 2007). The approach presented here provides a useful means of exploring these topics and structuring them into a conceptual hierarchy that specifies differences and associations in a meaningful way. We suggest that the analysis of symbolism and archaeological context will not only benefit archaeologists but also inform linguists and ethnologists about aspects of symbolism, worldview, culture, and the human mind.

"In fact all taxonomies are both folk (in the sense that they belong to a specific culture) and scientific, in the sense that science is a kind of categorization" (Ottenheimer 2006b:21). 2.
