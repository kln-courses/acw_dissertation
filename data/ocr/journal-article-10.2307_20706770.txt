<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER COMMUNICATION CULTURAL AFFINITIES OF MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE IN THE PHOENIX ISLANDS MIKE T. CARSON University of Hawai'i at M?noa The Phoenix Islands are among the Polynesian Mystery Islands (Bellwood 1978a:352-53), abandoned at the time of European contact yet bearing evidence of previous human occupation (Fig. 1). Archaeological survey (Emory et al., n.d.) has identified platforms, enclosures and other architectural creations on Manra and Orona Islands (Table 1, Figs 2 and 3). Whereas the architectural remains of other Mystery Islands such as Nihoa and Necker (in the Hawaiian archipelago) were undoubtedly of Polynesian origin (Emory 1928), the origins of the Phoenix architectural remains seem at first ambiguous. The Phoenix Islands are located at the northwest margin of the Polynesian Triangle, near West Polynesian population centres such as Tuvalu and Tokelau, yet not unreasonably distant from the Micronesian influence of Kiribati. Although Kiribati presently controls the uninhabited Phoenix Islands in a nominal political sense, the Phoenix architectural remains express a close affinity with a prehistoric Polynesian culture. Furthermore, as this study reveals, this affinity extends as far as the eastern portion of Polynesia (e.g., the Society Islands). The architecture attests to a group of people who built a variety of structures in the past and then abandoned the islands, leaving behind the traces of architecture indicative of East Polynesian marae. Kenneth Emory (Emory et al. n.d., Emory 1943, 1970 ) intermittently wrestled with the apparently anomalous nature of the Phoenix monuments, but he never successfully finalised his study. A new analysis of the original data provides some intriguing results. Previous archaeological work with Polynesian architecture has mainly included comparative description, functional assessment and relation to settlement pattern (Bellwood 1972; Best 1993; Clark and Herdrich 1993; Descantes 1993; Emory 1933,1934a, b; Green 1986,1993; Herdrich 1991; Kirch 1990; Weisler and Kirch 1985). Recent work has addressed more general anthropological issues in architectural design and utilisation (Burley 1994, 1996; Kolb 1991, 1992, 1994a, b). The present study of Phoenix architecture examines individual architectural traits as cultural units, 61</page><page sequence="2">62 Monumental Architecture in the Phoenix Islands *?* Kiribati PHo?nix Tuvalu ' Tokelau 0 250 km Samoa Fiji'??'O'.

The results, in comparison with architectural remains throughout Polynesia, elucidate cultural affinities to determine the role of the Phoenix Islands architecture in Polynesian prehistory and in relation to ancestral architectural complexes. West Polynesia has been well demonstrated as the homeland of the Polynesian cultures distributed further to the east (Green 1986,1994; Kirch 1984; Kirch and Green 1987). In the east, after some time, people developed cultural traditions which they did not share with people in their homeland to the west. In particular, a unique architectural tradition developed. The marae-ahu-tahua complex may be considered an ancestral Polynesian trait, found throughout all of Polynesia (Green 1986, 1993). However, marne took monumental form associated with developments in a religious arena only in East Polynesia. Additionally, East Polynesian marae came to dominate in the religious milieu, whereas malae in West Polynesia remained less prominent (Green 1986:54,1993). Monumental religious structures have been documented in the Cook Islands (Bellwood 1978b, Buck 1927), the</page><page sequence="4">64 Monumental Architecture in the Phoenix Islands Figure 2: Map of Manra Island (formerly named Sydney Island) Societies (Emory 1933), the Tuamotus (Emory 1934a), the Marquesas (Linton 1923,1925), the Hawaiian archipelago (Emory 1928; Thrum 1907, 1909,1910), Easter Island (Martinsson-Wallin 1994) and elsewhere in East Polynesia. Because Easter Island was almost certainly settled in isolation from the rest of Polynesia (Bahn and Flenley 1992, McCoy 1976, Mulloy and Figueroa 1978), the Easter Island religious structures offer insight into the ancestral forms of East Polynesian religious architecture. Comparison of these structures with other East Polynesian marae determines which architectural traits were at one time shared across East Polynesia as part of an ancestral complex of religious monuments. The ancestral East Polynesian marae incorporates five components: (i) central religious function, (ii) monumental scale, (iii) a courtyard area, (iv) an elevated surface associated</page><page sequence="5">Mike T. Carson 65 with the most sacred part of the marcie, and (v) channelling of supernatural personalities through earthly, often anthropomorphic, features. The transition from secular to sacred on a monumental scale is heralded as a hallmark distinction between West and East Polynesian marae (Emory 1943). The monumental scale of these structures may be attributed to their highly valued roles as important religious centres and gathering places, and so these two aspects of marae are inherently interlinked. The presence of some form of courtyard is necessary to accommodate the assembly of the public masses for ceremonies, and this aspect is also shared with West Polynesian malae. In a status-conscious religious setting, the presence of a raised platform or other elevated surface indisputably identifies distinction in sanctity or rank. Difference in physical height is an important indicator of relative status throughout Polynesia in both religious and non-religious contexts. Essential to the religious activities at marae, deities or sacred ancestors needed to be present in some capacity, such as via spirit possession. To facilitate the earthly manifestation of these supernatural personages, deified stone uprights or anthropomorphic images (stone or wooden tiki) were placed on the marae. Of the five ancestral components of East Polynesian marae, religious function and monumental scale are not directly observable, although they may be implied. The evidence from the Phoenix Islands monuments indicates an affinity with this ancestral complex. 172?11'W Figure 3: Map of Orona Island (formerly named Hull Island)</page><page sequence="6">66 Monumental Architecture in the Phoenix Islands The timing of Easter Island colonisation bears further implications for understanding the Phoenix architectural remains. An analysis of a series of radiocarbon dates suggests initial colonisation of Easter Island around A.D. 800 (Martinsson-Wallin 1994), and this date finds support from palaeoenvironmental investigations of human-induced changes to the Easter Island landscape (Flenley et al 1991). The date of initial settlement in Easter Island indicates a time when people were engaged in long-distance exploratory voyaging in Polynesia. At some point after this age of exploration in Polynesian prehistory, long-distance voyaging underwent a decline. When this decline took place, small and isolated islands such as the Phoenix and other Mystery Islands were among the first to experience abandonment (Irwin 1992:177). Presumably, the cost and risk of voyages to and from these islands were eventually considered unsustainable. Due to the poor living conditions on the Phoenix Islands, human occupation may not ever have been a long-term or large-scale endeavour. Rainfall is sporadic and unpredictable, but annual rainfall may approach 100 inches (Maude 1952:70-71). The coral ground surface supports neither fresh water sources nor adequate soil for significant plant growth other than Pisonia sp. and coconut (Maude 1952:70-71). Although exploitation of fish and bird populations might have been profitable, the dry climate and poor soil development limited the potential of agriculture and animal husbandry. Most importantly, the scarcity and unpredictable nature of fresh water severely inhibited attempts at human settlement. Despite these harsh conditions, people have successfully cultivated yam, sweet potato and swamp taro on other coral atolls in the Pacific with meager supplies of fresh water and poor soils. Furthermore, modern colonisation efforts have proven that a small number of people can survive on the Phoenix Islands (Maude 1952). Perhaps people voyaged to the Phoenix Islands to exploit the marine and avifaunal resources, leading to a pattern of recurrent temporary occupation of the islands. Also, people may have established short-term settlements on these islands as part of a systematic colonisation of the Pacific (Irwin 1989, 1990). Abandonment may have corresponded with a movement towards sedentism and away from long-distance voyaging in Polynesian prehistory. Although settlement on the Phoenix Islands was probably temporary and short-lived, people nonetheless developed a tradition of monumental architecture on these islands. When considering the cultural affinities of the Phoenix stone structures, a distinction must be maintained between an affinity and an influence. An affinity denotes an overall resemblance or similarity, whereas an influence denotes the direction of trait transmission. Nothing about an affinity in and of itself implies anything about the direction of trait transmission. Without</page><page sequence="7">Mike T. Carson 67 an existing population of Phoenix Islanders, ethnographic observations and linguistic comparison cannot offer any information (or misinformation) regarding cultural identity. The Phoenix architectural remains provide a means to use relics of the past to study the past directly rather than to speculate what the past may have been like. Archaeological interpretation of the architectural remains strongly suggests contact with East Polynesia, because the Phoenix structures are consistent with the ancestral East Polynesian mame, prevalent throughout East Polynesia yet absent from West Polynesia (Figs 4 and 5). A C Figure 4: A, B: Typical Marae and Malae. C: Typical Marae of Tahiti (from Emory 1943); C: Malae of Tokelau, showing god house, uprights covered in mats and four-legged wooden seat (from Macgregor 1937).</page><page sequence="8">68 Monumental Architecture in the Phoenix Islands Geographically, the Phoenix Islands are close to Kiribati and to West Polynesia. The stone structures are not similar at all to architectural forms in Kiribati. In addition, they do not bear any diagnostic resemblance to West Polynesian architecture. The only possibility of a West Polynesian affinity lies in some vaguely described "piles" of slabs and rubble on Manra Island. If these piles do not represent crumbled platforms, then perhaps they relate to burial mounds typical of West Polynesia such as the langi of Tonga (McKern 1929:33-36). A typical West Polynesian malae in Tokelau or Tuvalu (the nearest inhabited islands to the Phoenix Islands) includes a god house along with upright stones (Emory 1943:13, MacGregor 1937:65). In Tokelau, a god house may rest on top of a "low platform," and MacGregor (1937:65) reports at least one instance of an associated rectangular enclosure. Figure 5: Reconstruction of Manra Site A Platforms, enclosures, uprights and pits are evidently common architectural components in all parts of Polynesia. Based on the presence of these individual architectural components, all architectural remains in Polynesia are similar to some extent, but this similarity does not convincingly demonstrate direct contact or shared ancestry. Certainly, the occurrence of platforms does not substantiate a direct link between areas, as platforms and other architectural components offer the same structural functions cross culturally, likely the result of innumerable independent inventions rather</page><page sequence="9">Mike T. Carson 69 than a single unified global diffusionary pattern. Whereas individual traits can occur anywhere, the final outcome of how traits are combined is more likely to characterise a specific architectural concept or cultural tradition. For these reasons, the identification of the five components of East Polynesian marae (i.e., central religious function, monumental scale, courtyard, elevated surface and deified uprights or anthropomorphic figures) attains notable significance. Systematic classification and seriation of the Phoenix architectural sites provide the basis to make broader comparisons and to assess spatial and temporal variability. Only recently have archaeologists applied this approach (as outlined by Dunnell 1970, 1971, and Rouse 1967) to prehistoric Polynesian monuments (e.g., Graves and Cachola-Abad 1996). Of the different categories of architectural sites in the Phoenix Islands, platform sites exhibit the most variability, making them good candidates for archaeological analysis. Additionally, a platform site inherently possesses at least one of the diagnostic components of East Polynesian marae (i.e., an elevated surface). Through direct observation and some reasonable implied evidence, Manra Sites A and demonstrate the same combination of traits diagnostic of ancestral East Polynesian marae. Other sites in the Phoenix Islands share an affinity with various forms of prehistoric monuments documented throughout Polynesia. The Phoenix Islands may be considered in a broader geographic context along with other abandoned equatorial islands such as Howland, Washington, Fanning, Christmas and Maiden Islands. All of these islands occupy a zone within 5? North and 5? South of the Equator within the Polynesian Triangle. The architectural remains on these other abandoned Equatorial islands do not bear any significant resemblance to the remains on the Phoenix Islands. The only suggestive resemblance is between certain of the Manra Sites (A and B) and some of the platforms on Maiden Island. Emory (1934b) determined the Maiden stone structures to relate to East Polynesia. Likewise, Emory (1943:13) grouped the Phoenix architectural remains with similar remains on Tongareva, as examples of an early form of marae, hinting at the apparent shared components of a widespread ancestral form of East Polynesian marae. Certain aspects of the stone structures in the Phoenix Islands link them with the marae of East Polynesia. The combination of a platform, rectangular enclosure, and uprights in a single site typifies an East Polynesian marae (Emory 1943:11-13). Manra Sites A and offer examples of East Polynesian marae in West Polynesia. Additionally, Polynesian architecture is often expansive, incorporating a number of different components into a single complex. Multiple platforms and enclosures were constructed either in</page><page sequence="10">70 Monumental Architecture in the Phoenix Islands abutting position or in very close proximity (less than a few feet apart) in the Society, Marquesan and Hawaiian archipelagoes in East Polynesia. Site complexes on Manra Island share the same expansive nature of architecture. Site proximity reveals three potential site complexes on Manra Island: (1) Sites VI through VI3; (2) Sites C through I; and (3) Sites A (with three possible sub-divisions) and B. The individual sites of each complex bear characteristic variables distinguishing them from other sites. Sites VI through VI3 are practically identical, matching exactly the same analytic definition. This site complex was also constructed during a single period of architectural production (Temporal Unit I), as evidenced by a chronological seriation of individual architectural traits (Table 2). Possibly, Sites VI through VI3 are the result of a single construction event. The two other site complexes more convincingly represent multiple construction episodes, because they display variation in their traits and also occupy consecutive temporal units.

Emory et al. (n.d.) describe Sites C through I lying only a few feet apart from each other, occupying a single stretch of beach along the north-west coast of Manra Island. The inland-facing walls of all of these platforms align closely to a continuous line extending across the sites. Pits occur exclusively in association with Sites C through I. Pits most likely relate to a site's function rather than to a site's temporal context. Apparently, though, pits seriate along with temporally sensitive construction-related architectural traits. Different sites within this site complex were likely constructed at different points in time. Indeed, Sites C through I reflect activity across two consecutive time periods (Temporal Units I and II). Site A physically joins three subdivisions, and Site lies only a few feet away from this conglomerate site. These two platform sites are associated with the only rectangular enclosures reported on the Phoenix Islands. The platforms are also associated with a number of uprights. Finally, the platforms in this area occupy larger volumes than most other platforms on Manra Island. The relatively large platform volumes and numbers of additive features (enclosures and uprights) suggest a sizeable investment in construction labor, well beyond the bounds of utilitarian function. In this sense, Manra Sites A and showcase a visible and measurable degree of monumentality. The platform sites with the highest amount of labour investment are also associated with a diagnostic East Polynesian marae affinity. The unmistakable match in form with East Polynesian religious monuments leaves little if any doubt that Manra Sites A and performed the duties of religious ceremonial centres. In sum, Manra Sites A and meet all five criteria of the ancestral East Polynesian marae (central religious function,</page><page sequence="12">72 Monumental Architecture in the Phoenix Islands monumental scale, courtyard, elevated surface and sacred uprights or antliropomorphic images). Apart from Manra Sites A and B, many other monuments share at least partial homology with the ancestral East Polynesian marae complex. For example, all of the platform sites by definition incorporate an elevated surface. Many of the monuments may have overseen courtyards within their precincts. Although walled enclosures or curbstones define the limits of the courtyards for Manra Sites A and B, a courtyard need not be marked structurally. The only essential functional aspect of a courtyard is that it covers cleared level ground sufficiently spacious to accommodate the number of individuals gathered there for a ceremony. In many cases, knowledge of a courtyard's boundaries probably disappeared when people abandoned these sites. Likewise, the presence of a wooden carved anthropomorphic figure easily escapes the present archaeological record. Regarding material evidence for the channelling of supernatural spirits, only some upright slabs may survive archaeologically, as for Manra Sites A and B. Manra Sites C and J also display upright slabs, clearly demonstrating that the functional concept associated with these uprights was more widespread than merely at Manra Sites A and B. Very possibly, wooden tiki or other sanctified images at the Phoenix monuments have been intentionally removed or else naturally destroyed. With these considerations, the full extent of East Polynesian affinity probably exceeds what has been documented with Emory et a/.'s (n.d.) original data, easily testable with future archaeological investigation. The East Polynesian affinity for the Phoenix monuments may yet be applied on a larger scale than the confines of Manra Sites A and B. Such a larger scale would necessarily extend the East Polynesian affinity throughout additional Temporal Units (see Table 2). In this view, prehistoric Phoenix Islanders produced architecture characteristic of East Polynesian monuments for a considerable length of time. Although the East Polynesian affinity is identified, a date for this affinity proves problematic. This date must relate to a time following the development of a distinct marae conceptual complex in East Polynesia. A conservative interpretation of radiocarbon dates (following Spriggs and Anderson 1993) suggests a date later than A.D. 600 to 950 for colonisation of East Polynesia, with the development of the marae complex unfolding over an unknown amount of time, perhaps as long as two or three centuries. Nonetheless, earlier radiocarbon dates abound in East Polynesia. If the colonisation process is understood in terms of the components of island discovery, colonisation and eventual established settlement (Graves and Addison 1994), then the last phase of "established settlement" corresponds to the timing of the development of a distinct East Polynesian culture (as distinguished from</page><page sequence="13">Mike T. Carson 73 West Polynesia) including the East Polynesian concept of marae. The period of "establishment" probably agrees with the conservative "Chronometrie hygiene" date of A.D. 600 to 950 (Spriggs and Anderson 1993), with distinctive cultural traits developed toward the end of this period or perhaps following it. This time period is also associated with the practice of long distance voyaging and communication between archipelagoes in East Polynesia, accommodating East Polynesian contact with the Phoenix Islands. Sometime after societies became established, voyaging spheres contracted. This change in voyaging had the immediate effect of isolation or abandonment of the "Mystery Islands" such as the Phoenix group, and abandonment is dated around A.D. 1500 for other Mystery Islands such as Pitcairn (Weisler 1996). Taking this evidence into account, a wide date range for the East Polynesian marae affinity in the Phoenix Islands is between A.D. 950 and 1500. Emory concluded that the stone structures on Manra and Orona Islands were "probably erected by wanderers from the east" (Emory 1943:13). Initial or independent development of marae locally in the Phoenix Islands is unlikely. If marae truly did originate in the Phoenix Islands, then their extremely limited distribution in West Polynesia requires explanation. These structures are anomalous phenomena in West Polynesia, characteristic of the works of an isolated group of people. The evidence suggests not only an East Polynesian affinity but also an isolated East Polynesian presence and influence in the Phoenix Islands. This study offers the first documented evidence that people (or at least their architectural concepts) moved from East to West Polynesia at some point in time before European contact, given that abandonment of the Phoenix Islands pre-dates the historic era. Alternatively, scholars need to reconsider their perception of the boundaries between West and East Polynesia in prehistory. A recent (1997) archaeological survey of the Phoenix Islands has confirmed the accuracy of the observations recorded in Emory et al.'s (n.d.) manuscript, although the present condition of Manra Site A is very poor (DiPiazza and Pearthree, pers. comm.). In light of this evidence, the present resurrection and re-examination of the initial Phoenix Islands archaeological data has proven especially worthwhile.
