<plain_text><page sequence="1">Primate Politics , edited by Glendon Schubert and Roger D. Masters. Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. 296 pp. $40.00 (cloth). Primate Politics is organized into three sections. Part I is on primatology and politics, part II is on chimpanzees, and part III is on human political behavior. In edited collections of papers of this type, a recurrent problem is the lack of satisfactory contextualization; often the papers are allowed to speak for themselves, resulting in a disjointed sequence of articles. To the editors' credit, that is not the case here. There is an introduction to the volume, by Schubert, that reviews the changes that have occurred in primatological research during the past 25 years. The introduction also contains a brief overview of the book, noting that in parts I and II the central questions are how and why nonhuman primates behave politically and to what extent those kinds of behavior may resemble behavior of</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews / 1035 gathering-and-hunting bands or contemporary human society. Part III deals with the reverse question, that is, in what ways political behavior of humans resembles that of nonhuman primates. Part I also introduces in three papers an overview of primatological theory. The first of those is by Schubert on primate politics. He reviews the work of four primatologists that appears to have special credence for primate politics: M. Chance's theory of attention structure; F. de Waal's chimpanzee politics; S. Hrdy's study of hanuman langurs; and S. Strum's ecological study of the "Pumphouse Gang" of olive baboons. Although Schubert finds each of the studies revealing, especially Strum's long- term field research, the studies do not fully provide a requisite for a behavioral theory of primate politics. Among the factors that Schubert sees as necessary are a clarification of anthropomorphism in primate studies, clearly an ever-present problem in studies of simian behavior, and a prin- cipled definition of what constitutes political behavior. The latter is ex- pressed as cooperation or competition among different consanguineous (extended family) subunits for influence or control of whatever is of in- terest. Schubert acknowledges that by that definition the highest level of complexity in social behavior for simians corresponds to the prepolitical band level among humans. The second article in part I is T. Rowell's "On the Significance of the Concept of the Harem When Applied to Animals." Rowell first dis- tinguishes a harem as a human cultural institution from the pattern ob- served among some mammals in which an individual male excludes other adult males from his proximity to a sizable number of females. She then points out that a harem arrangement is possible only in environments that allow a long-range unobstructed view of the area in which the an- imals are located; that is, there must be clear and continuous monitoring of others' behavior. Females must also be able to aggregate, as in breed- ing colonies of elephant seals. Although the concept of a harem seems to apply to elephant seals, Rowell reports that research on patas mon- keys, guenon species, redtail monkeys, and blue monkeys reveals a dif- ferent picture. Although the monkey species are one-male groups, the mating patterns are not like those of the elephant seals. First, most of the mating occurs in synchronized bursts of female receptivity and sev- eral males participate. Remarkably, the one male mates infrequently. That poses the interesting question of why a male would routinely spend considerable energy chasing away other males from the females. Rowell poses an interesting possibility, namely, that the copulatory behavior of males may be more directed to other males than to male-female rela- tionships. Chasing away other males and mating could be a part of a male-male communication system more than a competition among them, a communication system that is important in determining male survival, which among one-male species occurs in the absence of females.</page><page sequence="3">1036 / Book Reviews The possibility that males and females have different social agenda is also the conclusion of F. de Waal's chapter, "Sex Differences in the Formation of Coalitions among Chimpanzees," in part II. The exami- nation of data collected at the Arnhem Zoo (Netherlands) on interven- tions and support choices in coalition behavior reveals that males are mostly involved in dominance strategies, whereas female coalitions serve to protect friends and relatives. The male coalition strategies appear to be linked to particular social goals rather than to individuals. In contrast, female coalition strategies appear to be linked to individuals and their well-being, de Waal speculates that similarities between human and chimpanzee coalition patterns may be due to similar goals based on male strategies and on female strategies, which would be an interesting phenomenon. Part II also includes a chapter by Jane Goodall, revised from her book The Chimpanzees ofGombe: Patterns of Behavior (1986). Goodall discusses male and female differences in aggression, noting that, whereas male aggression tends to occur in contexts of reunion, social excitement, and dominance rivalry, female aggression tends to be over competition for food and protection of offspring. Another aspect of chimpanzee be- havior that may be relatable to political behavior is "pseudospeciation," a process of culture-based group differentiation that is analogous to group formation on the basis of species differentiation. Hostility and violence appear to be strongly group based, directed even against individuals who formerly were fellow group members but who moved into another group. Along a different line, part I contains a chapter by S. Strum and B. Latour, "Redefining the Social Link: From Baboons to Humans," which attempts to redefine the meaning of "social" in social behavior. Strum and Latour propose a performance-based model of social behav- ior, one in which members are viewed as actors who perform and thus create society. That is in opposition to the older, ostensive definition of society as something in which individuals exist but is external to them and that can be seen only in the relations between actors. The perfor- mative model is argued to be more appropriate for baboon social activity, which includes constant testing and negotiation, and the authors indicate that baboons seem to be "asking" the same questions as the observers, that is, what patterns and consequences result from interactant perfor- mances? Strum and Latour point out that their claim for a more realistic concept of social behavior reduces the distance between social and po- litical behavior, that politics is not a realm of action separated from others. However useful the performative model, its use for differentiating simian from human behavior is problematic at best. Strum and Latour present an argument that the fundamental difference is to be found be- tween complexity and complication. Baboons illustrate complexity in their performances, an attendance to several factors at once, but humans ex-</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews / 1037 hibit complication in their interactions, an attendance to a series or succession of operations. The distinction, however, is not convincing. First, there is merely an assertion that baboons assimilate a variety of factors all at once. Even if that is done, it is difficult to imagine that human performative behavior is not at least as complex in the same way. Baboons do "parallel processing," but humans do not? Seems unlikely. Two chapters in part III illustrate, in fact, that human social inter- action involves complexity. D. Sullivan et al. show in "Facial Displays and Political Leadership: Some Experimental Findings" that various dis- plays involve multimodal signal transmission and perception. A hedonic display such as the eyebrow flash includes eyebrow movement, head movement, mouth position, and eye contact. In "Human Vocalizations in Agonistic Political Encounters," J. Schubert identifies and measures paralinguistic properties that accompany speech in face-to-face interac- tion in debate and discussion in small group decision making. He shows that interactants attend to both linguistic and paralinguistic cues and that the latter are sensitive to dominance relations. Part III also contains an innovative paper by N. Blurton Jones, "Tolerated Theft: Suggestions about the Ecology and Evolution of Shar- ing, Hoarding, and Scrounging." Jones develops a testable model for tolerated theft, which he sees as a simpler explanation for the evolution of food exchange than kin selection. A central feature of the model is that the same condition that gives rise to sharing of food also gives rise to the possibility of a contest or fight. Whether theft or contest occurs depends on the size of the quantity of food, and thus the interaction is a "political" one in relation to resources. The final chapter is by R. Masters, "Conclusion: Primate Politics and Political Theory." The first section of the chapter is a far-ranging discussion about fundamental questions in political science, the force of which is to show that the tendency to isolate political science from hu- man life has led to theoretical confusion. That is followed by a listing and discussion of features that differentiate human and nonhuman pri- mates and of features that they share. The idea is to produce a biogram- mar of primate social behavior, including the thorny issue of intention. Masters concludes that the basic phenomena of political life among hu- mans - power, influence, conflict, history - have direct analogues among nonhuman primates. Understanding politics in primate social behavior requires an understanding of dynamic interactions not only between in- dividuals but also between natural and cultural factors, that is, primates interacting with each other in relation to environmental phenomena. What, then, is political about primate behavior? The position taken throughout much of the book appears to be that aspects of behavior that involve competitive or potentially competitive interactions, human or nonhuman, constitute politics. At its most fundamental level, politics is</page><page sequence="5">1038 / Book Reviews thus interactant based. At that level analogues between simians and hu- mans are relatively clear and certainly worthy of the types of research that the editors and authors appear to promote. One major inconsistency, however, should be noted. Schubert's characterization of political be- havior as beyond the family level seems to be unnecessarily constraining and, in fact, inconsistent with most of the content of the book. The jus- tification that intrafamilial relationships are not studied by political sci- entists does not rectify the matter. BEN G.
