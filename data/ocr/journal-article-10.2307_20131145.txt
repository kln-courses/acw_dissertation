<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT'S THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION MARK LILLA Kant ist der Moses unser Nation. ?H?lderlin I HiVERY modern theory OF homo politicus presumes a theory of homo religiosus. This is a historical observation, not a theological one. Modern political philosophy began in a self-conscious response to the crisis of theological and political authority in Europe, and this response in turn transformed many aspects of our political experience which modern philosophy then had to take into account. Modern po litical philosophy is not religious today, nor is it exclusively or even primarily concerned with the social effects of religion. Religion, how ever, is its original problematic. Yet modern theories of homo religiosus originally arose out of dissatisfaction with homo Christianus. It would seem, then, that any investigation into the nature of modern political philosophy?its basis, its development, its strengths and limitations?would have to begin, at least initially, with an examination of how it understood the phenome non of Christianity. The New Sciences of Christianity. The political crisis of Western Christendom gave rise to two modern schools of thought about the na ture of Christianity and, eventually, of religion in general. For the sake of economy, let us call these the Epicurean and existential schools of religious science. In many respects these schools are indistinguish able. Both grew up in an atmosphere of military and psychological warfare being conducted in Jesus's name, and both deplored the fanat icism, obscurantism, and cruelties fostered by the doctrines of the Correspondence to: Department of Politics, New York University, 715 Broadway, New York, NY 10003 The Review of Metaphysics 52 (December 1998): 397-434.

Both schools condemned the struggle for author ity among Christian faiths and between Altar and Crown, yet both also appreciated the difficulty of freeing Europe from certain aspects of Christian morality without undercutting public obedience and private morals. Here the similarities between the schools end, however, and the task of distinguishing begins. We must distinguish first between their different diagnoses of Christianity's nature, then between the dif ferent therapies they proposed for removing the psychological and political evils it had caused. Religion as Behavior. The modern Epicurean approach to Chris tianity takes it as axiomatic that this religion did not make all things new, that it is a human phenomenon like any other, subject to the same methods of scientific analysis. This approach, founded by Hob bes and Spinoza, succeeds to the extent that it successfully levels. It first reduces Christianity to the level of "religion," then reduces reli gion to a form of "behavior," and further reduces all behavior to the dynamic relations among "passions" or "affects." On this basis the modern Epicureans find it possible to explain the existence of religion in modern scientific terms as something at once natural and perverse. Religion is natural because it is bred of the natural passions and igno rance of solitary human individuals; it is perverse because it excites fear and violence among them when they enter society. What do men naturally fear? In the state of nature only nature it self, whose workings appear arbitrary to simple minds unenlightened about its laws. Ignoring true causes, men attribute every turn of for tune to gods whom they make after an outsized image of themselves. They imagine these gods to be creatures endowed with wills and ca pable of causing effects in the physical world. They also assume that, just as men are subject to flattery, so are the gods. Yet when we try to curry their favor we learn that, again like men, the gods are willful and capricious, and this makes them fearsome. So while religion dissi pates natural fear it does not abolish fear altogether. There is a resid uum that is transferred from nature to the gods. This artificial fear is then mediated by a class of priests, who have an interest in perpetuat ing it. Through the miracle of their own escape from ignorance they are able to manipulate the ignorant belief in gods who work miracles.1 To this primary fear of nature and secondary fear of gods is added a third, the fear of other men. Not only are the intentions of others as obscure to us as those of the gods, their wrath is even</page><page sequence="3">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 399 harder to appease. Men hold views about divine matters that are vari ous (given human ignorance) and tenacious (given the power of pri mary fear), which is why there is religious conflict. These three fears?of nature, god, and men?reinforce each other. The more fear ful men are of the gods, the more willing they will be to fight to ap pease them; the more dangerous their Uves then become, the more readily they will turn to the gods for solace and protection. This cycle of fear is not an invention of Christianity, as even the modern Epicureans admit. It has always existed. What is novel about Christian doctrine is that, believing in its own novelty, it obscured the ancient Epicurean truths about religion and how it was to be con trolled. Christianity prides itself on being politically obtuse. These ancient truths were finally rediscovered through modern Epicurean science but the context in which they now had to be applied had been utterly transformed by Christianity's success. The national pagan reli gions had disappeared and Europe was now divided theologically and politically by a religion with universal pretensions. That called for a new response. The modern Epicurean strategy was at once allopathic and prophylactic. In the long term it hoped to drive out men's reli gious impulse by enlightening them about the true causes of natural phenomena and thus freeing them from natural fear and ignorance. In the short term it hoped to gain time by imposing an artificial political peace, whether through civil religion or toleration, so that the reli gious passions excited by Christianity would at least be controlled or 1 How do the priests escape the cave if not by miracle? To their credit, Hobbes and Spinoza address this problem, if obliquely. They admit that some human beings are drawn by pleasure to seek knowledge of ultimate causes, and are not driven merely by fear of pain. Early in the Leviathan Hobbes says that while most people are curious because they wish to control their environment, others display a fearless "lust of the mind" for knowledge, which he also calls a kind of "love." This love, or eros, draws some indepen dently to the idea of God as a first cause, which even aids their study of na ture. See Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, ed. Richard Tuck (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1991), 6.35, 11.25-27, 12.2^, 6. Spinoza at first appears stricter, beginning his Ethics with the assertion that all striving (con atus), even that of reason, is a striving for self-preservation. The treatise ends, however, with the beatific vision of a "third" kind of knowledge offering intuitive understanding of God that is worth possessing for its own sake. See also Benedictus de Spinoza, Ethics, in vol. 1 of The Collected Works of Spinoza, trans, and ed. Edwin Curley (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), Appendix, 4.P18-7; 2.P40; 5.P25.

If an enlightened millennium was only the Epicureans' distant goal, the progressive dechristianization of European politics was their immediate practical one. Modern liber alism grows out of this allopathic-prophylactic strategy vis-?-vis Christianity. Religious Need. A second school of religious science, which for lack of a better term we will call existential, was born in the eigh teenth century and has survived down to our day. On certain funda mental matters?the psychological and political harms caused by the Christian churches, the need for a new anthropocentric science to treat them?these schools are in perfect agreement. Unlike the mod ern Epicureans, however, who conceive of religion as reactive behav ior caused by the environment, the existential school takes religion to be an expression of essentially human qualities and needs, especially moral ones. Homo religiosus is a more profound problem for the ex istentialists because they see man naturally inclined to religion by his very essence, whatever illusions that inclination might entail. For the Epicurean school, the existence of religion proves that man has not risen above his animality; for the existentialist school, religion is one way man awkwardly distinguishes himself from the beasts. However demeaning religion can become, however politically threatening, it is also connected to something noble, or potentially noble. Moreover, what is true of religion in general might be true of Christianity in par ticular. That is the problem. The modern existential approach to religion owes much to the seventeenth-century deists but its real founder was Rousseau. Rous seau's novelty was to have distinguished the inclination to religion (which he, like the Epicureans, placed in the senses) from its perver sion in society. Rousseau saw nothing in principle wrong with reli gion because he saw nothing in principle wrong with sensibility or ig norance. Whatever fanaticism might be bred by a corrupt religion, history shows that a healthy religion can cultivate political and moral obedience, certainly more successfully than the systems of the philos ophers. The problem with religion is not our natural inclination to wards it; the problem is the corruption of this natural inclination by civilized living. Since the modern Epicureans fail to see the distinc tion between the natural and the civilized they fail to understand the genuine problems posed by Christianity. Those problems are psycho logical and political.</page><page sequence="5">KANT'S THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 401 Rousseau's major statement on religious psychology, "The Pro fession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar," is the tale of an ex-Christian told to a post-Christian. This is appropriate, for ?mile is the first post social animal, an artificial being, not a natural man. He is in Christian society but not of it, and therefore must learn to live among Christians without being corrupted by them. The Vicar's profession teaches him how to do this in matters of religion. As his story illustrates, the grav est danger Emile will face is moral skepticism. The Vicar recounts how he abandoned his own faith when confronted with the emptiness and hypocrisy of existing Christianity, only to be flung into an unbear able state of anxiety and doubt. Unable to live with Christianity, which he now found false, he discovered he could not live with skepti cism, no matter how true it might be. Skepticism is a sentimental, and therefore existential, impossibility. That is why it is so dangerous: it is always a prelude to a leap of faith and a moral mistake. Long before Chesterton, Rousseau saw that the problem with skepticism is not that skeptics believe nothing, but that they will believe anything. Wol mar is the exception, not the rule. To protect Emile from the consequences of skepticism he is taught a purely moral religion that forswears fruitless theological speculation and relies entirely on his lumi?re int?rieure to reveal the cause of his being and the rule of his duties.2 Protected by these arti cles of faith, confident that he will not lose heart, Emile is able to pass into Christian society by holding publicly to the moral essentials of the Gospels while ignoring privately those doctrinal sophisms that might distort the judgment of his heart. Rousseau's wager is that a practical, self-generated faith like this could inspire conviction. Hitherto, men had sought relief from skepticism through faith in a "something else" without; Emile will be protected by discovering that "something else" within. If Emile is fortunate enough to find himself in the sort of re public described in the Social Contract his moral religion will be in harmony with the civil one; if not, his private faith will still allow him to survive the disharmony he will feel among corrupt Christians. In ei ther case, the principles of his humanistic agape will have been placed on a footing independent of nomos. 2 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emile, in Oeuvres compl?tes (Paris: Galli mard, 1959), 4:552-4, 570, 627-8, and 632-5n.</page><page sequence="6">402 MARK LILLA Deism may have existed before Rousseau, but it was works like the "Profession of Faith" that prepared a new approach to the theolog ical-political problems of Christendom. Were the modern Epicureans right that religion is just ignorance fueled by passions, they would also be correct to pursue the allopathic strategy of progressive en lightenment. Yet if, as the existential school following Rousseau maintains, religion expresses in vulgar form something humanly ele vated, then the therapy must be homeopathic. That is, the psycholog ical need for religion must be satisfied, whether by reforming existing faiths to make them more enlightened, or by developing ersatz reli gions to satisfy man's moral needs without threatening the political order. Faced with the theological-political challenges that arose within Christianity, the Epicureans sought protection, the existential ists sought compensation. The existentialist approach also provided for the first time a hu manistic standard by which existing or created religions might be judged. For the modern Epicureans, all religions are equally base be cause even the truths they enunciate are cloaked in falsehoods, and all falsehoods are eventually corrupting. The only distinction Epicu reans are willing to make among religions is the degree to which they can be manipulated for the public good. The existentialists' recogni tion of religion's potential nobility, on the other hand, implies a non political standard by which religions might be distinguished or even rank-ordered. The Epicureans considered it a great achievement to have brought Christianity down to the level of other religions a mille nium after Augustine had succeeded in elevating it above them. Per haps unwittingly, the existentialist science of religion founded by Rousseau would again make it possible for one sect or Christendom as a whole to claim superiority, now on rational, enlightened grounds. A Revolution. Kant was the child of Rousseau but not a disciple. This is an important distinction. Though Kant was swept away by Rousseau's insight into man's moral nature and his own work was transformed by it, he was no common Rousseau enthusiast. Indeed, it was Rousseau's own enthusiasm and that of his followers that gave Kant pause in matters religious. Unless the idea of a moral religion could be placed on more secure foundations than those of sentiment and inner light, Kant worried that it would only compound the psy chological and even political damage that Christianity had already done. While it might weaken the churches, it could also serve as li</page><page sequence="7">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 403 cense for visionaries and cranks. Kant's moral philosophy is often de scribed as a philosophically disciplined account of Rousseau's original moral insight, which it is. The same cannot be said, however, without qualification of Kant's philosophy of religion. While that philosophy presupposes Rousseau's moral-existential turn, Kant provided an ut terly novel account of religious experience and its relation to politics. His was the third theological-political revolution in modern thought, and perhaps the most consequential. II Fanaticism. Kant's first published reflections about religious ex perience, as opposed to philosophical theology, are psychological in nature. They are, not surprisingly, about fanaticism. They are also, somewhat tangentially, about Rousseau. In his early essays on madness and on the visionary medium Swe denborg, Kant notes a disturbing parallel between Rousseau's moral sublimity and Swedenborg's ravings about the spirit world. This paral lel leads him to distinguish between the psychological phenomena of superstition (Aberglaube), which he sees rooted in the senses, and fa naticism (Schw?rmerei) which he believes must have nonsensual causes.3 Kant takes the modern Epicurean account of superstition to be roughly correct and treats it as a relatively insignificant expression of weakness. The superstitious believe in the principles of reason, they just do not believe those principles apply in every case. Religious fanatics like Swedenborg, however, are fearless, learned, and serene. They are clearly not driven to religion by fear, they are drawn to it by "something else." And this sense of "something else" is so strong that 3 Immanuel Kant, Lectures on Ethics, trans.

The superstitious are weak but basi cally rational; fanatics are strong and, at the extreme, anti-rational. Rousseau is not superstitious, nor a religious fanatic. Yet there is a kind of moral fanaticism to his character that clearly disturbs Kant. Rousseau is morally sublime, and sublimity is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing to see and to feel within oneself the moral dig nity of man; it is a curse to see that promise unfulfilled every hour of every day. It is little wonder that Rousseau is melancholic. In a per fect world his sublimity would incline him to justice, independence, and loyalty. In our world it renders him hypochondriacal and para noid, and highly suspicious of reason. Kant in these essays senses a relation between moral sublimity, the denial of reason, and religion, though he cannot quite put his finger on it. At the extreme, he thinks there is a connection between religious experience bred of melan choly and mental illness, and suggests how these conditions can in duce derangement (Verr?ckung), madness (Wahnsinn), even insanity Wahnwitz). Swedenborg reached that extreme, Rousseau did not. Still, the parallel is there and it is disturbing. What is it about human nature that can transform the most morally sensitive of creatures into a "waking dreamer," a "doctor of the Sorbonne" in melancholy and fantasy? What connection is there between the strivings of the beauti ful soul and the lunacy of the spirit-seer? What does fanaticism as a psychological phenomenon tell us about homo religiosus?4 4 Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, trans. J. T.

Kant's transcendental turn in metaphysics marked a turn in the science of religious experience as well. While superstition is universal in human societies, and the mod ern Epicurean account of it as good as any, the existence of fearless and learned fanatics like Swendenborg pointed to deeper causes of our religious propensity. Furthermore, the example of Rousseau, in his writings and his existence, suggested that these causes might be linked to our most noble characteristics.5 Man is a creature endowed with reason; man is also, wherever we find him in society, homo reli giosus. Therefore we can ask: Is there something about the nature of reason that predisposes human beings to religion? The Critique of Pure Reason prepares an answer to this question by establishing two facts about human nature: the finitude of the un derstanding and the infinite desire of reason. Today we have come to see Kant's achievement almost exclusively in his analysis of human finitude. His contemporaries and romantic followers were perhaps more inspired by his restoration and modification of the classical un derstanding of reason's desires. Kant rejects the modern Epicurean account of reason as a passive calculating faculty, just as he rejects Rousseau's characterization of its coldness and heartlessness. Reason is, just as Plato intuited, a hunger, an active yearning for wholeness. Kant opens the Transcendental Dialectic, the most important section of the Critique of Pure Reason, with a defense of Plato's intuition, though not of his doctrine of Ideas. While the modern Epicureans rightly scoffed at this doctrine, they were foolish to ignore Plato's analysis of the "higher need" reason feels to seek knowledge beyond experience. Even if the truth of experience is always ready at hand within experience, it is undeniable that "we are not satisfied [zufrieden] with the exposition merely of that which is true, but like wise demand that account be taken ofthat which we desire [begehren] to know."6 Is this desire a desire of reason? Kant could not be clearer on this point. Throughout the Critique of Pure Reason the faculty of reason 5 Cf. CJ, 447. 6 Critique of Pure Reason (hereafter "CPR"), trans.

They are qualities arising from reason's activity as an "architectonic" faculty.12 In technical terms, reason is the faculty that seeks the totality of con ditions for every conditioned thing it encounters. Since that totality is only given in things-in-themselves, however, to which neither reason nor understanding has access, reason must order the concepts of the understanding through principles, which in turn must be ordered through Ideas. Such Ideas are inherently problematic, since they do not arise from experience yet are necessary for us to think the unity of our experience. To take the Ideas as objectively necessary is the tran scendental illusion to which Plato and his followers succumbed; but it is no less illusory to hold, as the skeptics do, that we can do without them subjectively.13 Reason must employ the Ideas at least regula tively or it would be unable to guide the understanding, and without that guide there would be no criterion of truth. If reason is to com plete its architectonic task, it must adapt itself to a necessary illusion regarding the Ideas.14 The appeal to Ideas is the father of all metaphysics. Until human beings learn that this appeal is both illusory and necessary?that is, until they learn to think and live with necessary illusions?they will not find satisfaction (Befriedigung). Man is not, as the medieval Pla tonists pictured him, a creature astraddle two horses, one galloping after sensual satisfaction, the other straining after the ideas that will make him whole.

Surrounding that island are the rocks of religion, threatening shipwreck.15 This analysis of man's existential relation to metaphysics is wholly new and provides the basis of Kant's analysis of religion. It can be summarized in three propositions: (1) against the Epicureans, the drive to metaphysics is natural (Naturanlage, metaphysica natu ralise (2) against Rousseau, this drive is a property of the rational faculty, not sense or sentiment; (3) against Plato, we can only hope to satisfy our curiosity with necessary illusions because the Ideas are in accessible. "There has always existed and will always continue to ex ist some kind of metaphysics," Kant declares, and its abandonment "is as little to be expected as that we should prefer to give up breathing all together."16 We are still far from digesting the significance of this declaration for the philosophy of religion. If true, it means that Epicureans who expect the impulse to religion to wither with enlightenment are them selves living an illusion. In the Prolegomena Kant likens them to peas ants who, seeing the river flow, expect it to flow away.17 Man does not just think he needs metaphysics; he actually needs metaphysics to think. And this is a good thing too, a "fortunate error," because it spurs us to look beyond our immediate experience and to make progress in science and morals.18 The necessity of metaphysics, how ever, also renders man's relation to the question of religion madden ingly dialectical. He flits from dogmatism to skepticism, thence to ma terialism, and finally to indifferentism, "the mother, in all sciences, of chaos and night."19 Such indifference in metaphysical matters is un tenable, though not because it is an existential impossibility, as Rous seau thought. Doing without metaphysics is a rational impossibility because reason cannot give a unified account of itself without it. That 15 CPR, B294-5.

All human beings are creatures en dowed with reason, therefore all human beings presuppose certain Ideas in the very act of thinking. Not all human beings, however, are concerned to establish the conditions and unity of their reason. So even if metaphysics is a transcendental necessity of thought, it might not be an existential need for the unreflective. The "needs of reason" would then explain the universal possibility of religion but nothing about the experience of religion. Every modern theory of religion faces this problem of the few and the many. As we have noted, even Hobbes and Spinoza had to recognize sotto voce a distinction between the many who are driven into the arms of revealed religion by fear and ignorance, and the few who are drawn to it by a higher desire. Rousseau managed simulta neously to democratize the need for religion and to ennoble it, though only by separating that need from our rational faculties and placing it in our universally shared sentiments. Kant cannot pretend that all hu man beings are speculatively inclined; few are curious enough to take up the puzzles of metaphysics, fewer still try to solve them with ar cane ontological, cosmol?gica!, or physico-theological proofs of God's existence. Curiosity cannot explain the universal attraction to religion. Some other aspect of reason must. Kant solves this problem by distinguishing reason's unified na ture from its various employments. Reason is reason, but its needs will differ depending on whether it is being employed speculatively or practically. Only the philosophical few experience the stir of curios ity about the conditions of their thought, and for them the Critique of Pure Reason offers the only genuine speculative satisfaction. All hu man beings experience, however, the "feeling of a need" to secure the rational conditions of their actions. Everyone must choose whether to pursue one end in life rather than another, everyone must decide what is permitted or forbidden in particular situations.

Kant's turn from speculation to moral practice owes everything to his reading of Rousseau, that much is clear. His analysis of the needs of practical reason, however, so clinical compared to the Vicar's de scription of the dark night of the soul, masks an important advance over Rousseau in explaining the propensity to religion. Practical rea son is defined as reasoning about the will; to will is to will an end; practical reason is therefore reasoning about ends. When we reason about the end of all our willing, we are led necessarily to the idea of happiness in line with virtue, which is the "highest good." Yet the con cept of a highest good is inherently problematic because its constitu ent subconcepts?happiness, virtue?could easily come into conflict. This raises the prospect of practical reason finding itself in an anti mony similar to that of speculative reason, pointing us now towards happiness without virtue as an end, now towards virtue without happi ness. Kant's conclusion is that this genuine antinomy can only be re solved by postulating the Ideas of human freedom, human immortal ity, and the existence of God. Moreover, since the need to escape the antinomy of practical reason is universal, the postulates must be con sidered the necessary subjective conditions of our pursuing the high est good as an end. If ends can be duties (and they can), we are duty bound to assert at least subjectively the truth of these regulative Ideas.22 Kant's novel view is that religion as a psychological phenomenon arises ultimately out of the needs of practical reason, and that fear, ig norance, and even sentiment only respond to that need. Man is not re ligious because his ignorance and fear have been exploited, though 21 CPR, B501-2; CPrR, 5, and 140-3; and What Does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?

Man is religious because he is genuinely needy, to the very core of his being, because he must pur sue ends and in so doing reasons about them. Spinoza may think he can be a speculative atheist, says Kant, but in order to act he must as sume God's existence as the moral author of the world. Homo reli giosus is homo cogitans in action.23 Dogmatismus naturalis. Two sorts of religious phenomenon are placed in an entirely new light by Kant's analysis of man's practi cal needs. One is the dogmatic basis of most religions known to us. Modern Epicureans have trouble understanding the persistence of dogmatism in any terms other than those of exploitation. Man is thought to seek revelation to assuage his ignorant fears and is willing to accept the tyrannical rule of priests in order to get it. Rousseau can point to a general moral confusion brought on by civilized living, but cannot really explain why dogmas are so tenaciously held even by those whose hearts are pure. Kant suggests that dogmatic religion ac tually has roots in man's moral nature, not in his departure from it. Throughout his works Kant defines religion consistently as the "rec ognition of our duties as divine commands"?that is, real duties as imaginary commands. Man knows he has duties; he knows the moral law. What he does not know is the ground of those duties or all the implications of that law. Even moral human beings need practical certainty about the duties they already feel, but "since no doctrine ex clusively based on reason would seem to make an unalterable norm, they demand a divine revelation."24 This they receive from the mouth of an anthropomorphic god whom they fashion less out of fright than in hope of relieving themselves of the difficult task of securing the foundations of morality. Aware of the arduous demands of the moral life, they prefer to worship and serve a fetish rather than set out alone in pursuit of the highest good. Their need for speculative certainty about morals leads them to accept anything in the name of merely moral certainty. It is a peculiar strength of human nature to find the moral law written on our hearts; it is our peculiar weakness to think that a divine transaction is needed to fulfill it. This weakness evokes Kant's pity 23 CJ, 451-3. ^Religion, 103.</page><page sequence="15">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 411 for believers rather than contempt for them, however repugnant he finds dogma itself. In the Antinomy of Pure Reason he describes in sympathetic terms the passionate zeal of those ignorantly attached to the dogmatism of pure reason and their suspicion of modern empiri cism. He regrets this suspicion in the realm of science but finds it un derstandable in moral matters. The fact is that the cosmological Ideas do offer subjective foundations for morals, however weak, and by giv ing a rational account of the whole they also provide comfort. Modern empiricism forswears all truck with such ideas, thus ignoring the real architectonic needs of practical reason. So long as a thorough critique of reason has not been carried out, most men will be dogmatists.25 Except a Man Be Born Again. . . . Those who cling to the dog matic chains that bind them are fanatics of a pure sort. However un derstandable their need for moral certainty, their embrace of an exter nally imposed law means the abandonment of autonomy, and thus of morality itself. There is another sort of fanaticism, however, whose effects are more ambiguous. In a pregnant aside in The Conflict of the Faculties, Kant distinguishes orthodox dogmatism, which offers us re wards for doing our duty, from mysticism, which promises to make us "other men." In these pages Kant can barely repress admiration for the mystical impulse to self-transcendence, which seems so closely al lied to the demand of the moral law for self-renunciation. The dogma tist is, at bottom, a coward and cheat; the mystic is a holy fool whose sublime sense of morality has been perverted by the fantasy of super natural union with the godhead. In his passionate desire to make pos sible the self-transformation demanded by morality, and despairing of the knowledge to bring it about, he loses himself in a cloud of un knowing. He is quick to free himself from bondage to inherited dogma, only to enslave himself to his private dreams. This is unac ceptable. Yet it is a step in the right direction.26 All human beings are drawn out towards the beyond by the need to make sense of their moral experience. Most accept the dogmas of their inherited religions for off-the-rack answers to their doubts and are more than willing to trade the responsibilities of autonomy for the formulas of stone tablets. Yet a few understand what is demanded of them and crave self-transformation, though they do not know how to 25 Religion, 103,112,154, and 168-70.

Others, like Rous seau, swing between reveries about natural goodness and misan thropic broodings about the way of all flesh. They are all examples of a human yearning for something beyond, something which, in ways we do not understand, also exists within. We learn from them that the attraction to religion has its roots in needs at once rational, moral, and noble, and that we are obliged to satisfy those needs rationally, mor ally, and nobly. Ill I Am Not Worthy. It is difficult to take Kant's religious postulates seriously, or those who do. Heine set the tone long ago with his little joke that Kant, having done away with God in the first Critique, re vived Him in the second to console his old servant Lampe. It is also hard to imagine anyone taking genuine comfort from immortality or God as Kant conceives them. Since man is finite, Kant says, immortal ity must be understood as the possibility of infinite moral progress for the species; and since we cannot know the qualities of a God existing outside time and space, we can only assume He establishes harmony between natural and moral law. Placing one's hopes in eternal life or God's terrible swift sword is one thing. Finding solace in these "sub jectively necessary Ideas of reason" is quite another. More perplexing still is Kant's assumption that moral men need comfort at all, that even a worthy moral Ufe will be threatened by de spair and self-doubt. It is true that the postulates of the Savoyard Vicar, on which Kant relies, are passed on to ?mile to protect him from skepticism. Rousseau considered doubt to be a social vice, how 26 The Conflict of the Faculties (hereafter "Faculties") m Practical Phi losophy, 54-9. This work also contains a curious appendix titled "On a Pure Mysticism in Religion," which is a letter written by C. A. Wilmans, one of Kant's young admirers and the author of a treatise on similarities between Kant's doctrine and that of the mystics. The letter is a remarkably succinct and accurate account of Kant's own teaching, and concludes with the procla mation that it is already being put into practice by a group of "merchants, ar tisans, and peasants" who preach a rationalized moral Christianity and call themselves mystics. In a footnote Kant refuses to endorse all of Wilmans' view but fails to correct a single word the latter wrote.</page><page sequence="17">KANT'S THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 413 ever, not a natural psychological phenomenon. Left to his own de vices, ?mile would never doubt the rule of his heart. Kant, on the other hand, believes moral consciousness necessarily entails the grav est doubts about our moral worth, and presents the postulates as the only rational means of relieving them. The postulate of immortality responds to the question, "can I ever be worthy of happiness?" with the assurance that the human species will be given infinite time to im prove itself. The postulate of God responds to the question, "will I be happy if I am worthy?" with the assurance that such hope is not mis placed. So long as we assume that moral men are haunted by a sense of unworthiness, we can at least understand why these postulates take the form they do. Yet why should we make this assumption? Justification. The belief that man needs to be justified before God is a central tenet of the Christian faith. Christians accept the Jew ish account of man's fall from perfection but deny that the Law is suf ficient to make him pleasing in God's eyes. Strict observance of God's commands is not enough, we must become "other men." The Christian doctrine of justification is linked to three others: the doctrines of sin, grace, and holiness. Following St. Paul, the Chris tian churches hold man's original sin to have been pride, which is in eradicable by human means. The doctrine of grace explains how and why the Father sent his Son to take this sin upon himself, justifying men despite their lingering imperfections. If this grace is accepted it can also assist men in becoming more holy on earth, which is to say, more humble. The Christian moral universe is circumscribed by the vice of pride and the virtue of humility, and the individual Christian can live within its bounds only so long as he knows that divine grace assists him and justifies him in God's eyes. That is the doctrine. Yet like so many others, this doctrine is open to extreme interpretations that can upset the very moral balance it tries to establish. The destabilizing factor is not the idea of sin but that of holiness as a life of humility. If humility is a virtue it is a most peculiar one because it is, almost by definition, unattainable. To be humble is to be aware that we can never be humble enough; to say that we possess humility is to express pride, which erases our humil ity. The psychological ramifications of this paradox are profound for the Christian believer. Humility works on him as a moral quicksand, drawing him slowly into a state of moral despair over his incorrigible imperfection. Within the history of Christian doctrine the most</page><page sequence="18">414 MARK LILLA extravagant heresies?absolute predestination, hastening the apoca lypse through sin?have sprung up to offer believers relief from it. All these heresies center on the concept of grace. The orthodox churches have therefore tried to develop doctrines of grace that would protect believers from moral despair without fueling their pride, no easy task. The gate is narrow and the way is straight. On the one side Augustine, on the other Pelagius. Pride and Humility. Pride and humility also color Kant's moral universe and further distinguish it from Rousseau's. Take, for exam ple, Kant's treatment of moral heteronomy. In the Critique of Practi cal Reason he criticizes both "external" and "internal" material grounds for the determination of the will. One can understand why he rejects external grounds, whether subjective (political) or objective (divine), since their externality as such renders them heteronomous. Yet what exactly is wrong with internal grounds, especially the objec tive one of Stoic self-perfection? The standard answer is that since self-perfection is a material principle it is not universalizable, which is certainly Kant's view. Kant also betrays a real moral repugnance, however, for the principle of human material self-perfection because of what he calls its solipsism (Selbstsucht). Solipsism can either ap pear as self-love (Eigenliebe) or self-conceit (Eigendunkel), a distinc tion no doubt derived from Rousseau. While Eigenliebe, like amour de soi-m?me, is good so long as it is controlled by practical reason, Eigendunkel is a more dangerous and deeply rooted human vice than amour propre. Amour propre is a vice we acquire in society, it is not natural to man. But Kant considers Eigendunkel to be a universal hu man propensity closer to Augustine's amor sui. He also calls it arro gantia, or pride. Man must always be on his guard against the tempta tions of arrogance, which the Stoic goal of self-perfection threatens to excite. The temptations of pride are invoked time and again in Kant's criticism of ancient and modern eudaemonism. He considers classi cal ideas of nobility and magnanimity to be nothing more than "exag gerated self-conceit," and modern sentimentalism to be pathological self-flattery about one's own goodness. He is very suspicious of those who risk their Uves to save the shipwrecked or defend their countries, wondering whether such extreme behavior does not reflect pride in "extravagant greatness" or "highflown, puffed up pretension." He even maintains in one hyper-Christian passage that Christian love,</page><page sequence="19">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 415 agape, can itself be a cover for "proud conceit" when it arises from feeling rather than duty.27 His main target, however, is the ancient ideal of virtue as the "heroism of the sage," which he rejects in the name of the holiness (Heiligkeit) of duty, self-esteem based on humil ity (Demut), and a healthy sense of moral insufficiency.28 Kant is loath to mention examples of moral holiness as he conceives it for fear of exciting pride, but on the few occasions when he speaks of exemplars they are all figures who suffered humbly for righteousness' sake. For students he singles out three lives for study: an imaginary "honest man" who defends Anne Boleyn against Henry VIII, Job, and Jesus, who, he adds, is particularly admirable for having suffered humiliation as the Son of God.29 Humiliation and Respect. Kant's admiration of humility and condemnation of pride is thoroughly Christian. His understanding of how these moral qualities arise within us and how they interact is not Christian, however. Humility is a cherished Christian virtue because, like all virtues, it is taken to be unnatural. Man is naturally inclined to the sin of pride and it is only through divine grace assisting his will that this sin can be overcome and replaced by humiUty. Kant accepts the naturalness of pride but he cannot accept the Christians' heterono mous account of the divine assistance necessary for attaining virtue. Man may not be naturally good but whatever good he can achieve must arise from his autonomous powers, not some alien source. Au gustine and Pelagius were divided above all by the question of what is natural to man. For Augustine it was sin, which threw into doubt the possibility of virtue; for Pelagius it was the capacity for virtue, which threw into doubt the existence of original sin. Kant's problem is more difficult still, if not impossible: to account for the natural possibility of both pride and humility. 27 CPrR, 40, 73, 82-6, and 155-8. 28 CPrR, 127-9n. Cf. Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion in Cambridge Religion and Rational Theology, 1075-6. 29 CPrR, 156; Religion, 60-1; On the Miscarriage of all Philosophical Trials in Theodicy (hereafter Theodicy) in Religion and Rational Theology. To insure that the study of humble lives itself does not become a source of pride, Kant invents a competitive children's game in which moral heroes would be placed in the dock and judged according to the rule that "it is in suf fering that holiness and virtue show themselves most excellently"; CPrR, 156. One can only speculate what the author of Emile would have made of this suggestion.</page><page sequence="20">416 MARK LILLA This he does at the turning point of the Critique of Practical Rea son in the section titled "The Incentives of Pure Practical Reason."30 It is hard to find more perplexing pages than these in all of Kant's writ ings. Their aim, in Kant's technical language, is to show that the will can be moved subjectively by the objective moral law: that is, that the objective motive (Bewegungsgrund) for incorporating the moral law into one's maxims, which motive can only be the moral law itself, can also serve as a subjective incentive (Triebfeder) to the will. Each step in Kant's argument is questionable. He begins by taking as given his earlier thesis that consciousness of the moral law is a "fact of reason," that is, that the principle of morality is innate in rational creatures. He then makes the psychological assertions that we will put up sensible resistance to this law, that we will be conscious of this resistance, and that this consciousness will cause us pain. The pain arises because we are conscious of the moral law striking down our self-conceit (Eigendunkel), thereby humiliating us (dem?tigen). Humiliation is painful. In the most extraordinary assertion of all, however, Kant then claims that we naturally feel respect for what humiliates us. The conclusion to the argument is then in sight: the objective moral law becomes a subjective incentive to action through the natural respect we experience in the face of humiliation. This passage deserves quo tation in full: So the moral law strikes down self-conceit. But since this law is still something in itself positive?namely the form of an intellectual causal ity, that is, of freedom?it is at the same time an object of respect inas much as, in opposition to its subjective antagonist, namely the inclina tions in us, it weakens self-conceit, that is, humiliates it, it is an object of the greatest respect and so too the ground of a positive feeling that is not of empirical origin and is cognized a priori.31 Let us leave aside the obvious question whether the argument is circular, given that it is hard to imagine humiliation evoking respect unless we already feel (and not merely know) the humiliator to be re spectable. Let us concentrate instead on its psychological implica tions. For what Kant believes he has established is the naturalness of pride and humility, and their dialectical relation. In other words, that he has united Augustine and Pelagius. This is the key to understand 30 CPrR, 71-89; compare Religion, 36. 31 CPrR, 73</page><page sequence="21">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 417 ing Kant's otherwise inexplicable analysis of the battle between the good principle and evil principle in the moral life of man.32 The Battle of Good and Evil. Kant's stubborn attachment to the concept of evil is a stone of stumbling and rock of offense to aU those who have seen in him a pure modern Pelagian. Goethe had the de cency to be revolted by what Kant said about evil in Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason.33 He felt betrayed, and one can see why. For in his earlier writings Kant seemed to follow Rousseau and Goethe in declaring the inclinations to be good (within reason) and in rejecting the Pauline-Augustinian obsession with concupiscence.34 Now Kant declared, in no uncertain terms, that there is evil, radical evil in the world, and that it is to be found in every remote corner of the globe, from the cultivated cities of Europe to the tents of the Dog Rib Indians.35 Yet an attentive reading of Kant's earUer moral writings in light of his declarations in Religion shows that he was never a wholehearted Pelagian and that his syncretic moral vision owes just as much to Au gustine. From the first he declared that virtue is the moral disposition uin conflict," and, later, that virtue "presupposes the presence of an enemy."36 The moral life is not limited to cultivating the seeds of goodness, for next to them are planted the seeds of evil and these must be rooted out. Seen in moral terms, the life of man is a battle field on which the warring principles of good and evil (das Gute, das B?se) seek to establish dominion over us. In this battle no man can re main indifferent; he must choose. Morality demands "a complete change of heart," a "revolution" in our disposition oriented by the spirit of the moral law.37 After this decision an endless struggle for self-overcoming begins, for a humanistic holiness that no human being can ever achieve. Yet what is evil? Evil is not of the flesh; on this Kant, Goethe, and Rousseau are in agreement. It must therefore be of the spirit. 32 Kant calls humiliation one of the "purest moral sentiments" at CJ, 446, though in Metaphysics of Morals, 435-6 he specifies that true humility only arises out of respect for the moral law, not comparison with others. 33 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Letter to Herder, June 7,1793, Goethes Werke.

How then can evil exist within a free will? Kant's answer is nothing if not subtle. To use his technical language, it is explained by distin guishing properly between subjective and objective incentives (Trie bfedern) to the wiU. The rational end of the human wiU is the highest good, which has been defined as happiness in line with mora?ty. Con sidered as ends, happiness is a subjective incentive, moral worthiness is an objective one. Like all our predispositions (Anlagen), the pur suit of happiness is good, so long as it is subordinated to the objective incentive of mora?ty. If there is evil in the human heart (and there is), it must arise from the inversion of the two kinds of incentives, that is, the subordination of the objective law of duty to our happiness. Why this inversion takes place, we do not know; Kant caUs it a mystery. How it occurs is clear: through pride. Evil does not tempt us with sen sual pleasures. Evil seduces us with the honeyed voice of reason, pro viding us with principled arguments for preferring our own happiness to the moral law. This is Kant's interpretation of the story of the faU in Genesis. Adam and Eve's sin was not to have eaten the apple out of hunger or curiosity, both natural and good inclinations. It was to have been persuaded by the serpent to subordinate in principle God's com mand to those inclinations. It was the sin of pride. Evil is a form of reasoning. This was Rousseau's view as weU: re caU the startling image in the Second Discourse of the philosopher sit ting at his desk working out a system of moraUty while down in the street throats are being sUt. Again, however, for Rousseau the casu istry of evil was a by-product of civiUzation. For Kant, evil is a natu ral, if inexplicable, fact about man everywhere. The psychological ramifications of this doctrine are profound indeed for Kant's system of morality and his conception of reUgion. For by accepting the good ness of the inclinations along with the rea?ty of radical evil, Kant nec essarily pushes the source of that evil deeper into the free wiU. More over, if the Critique of Pure Reason is to be beUeved, we can know 38 On the goodness of reason, see CPR, B670-1, 697, 771,829, and 845-7; Religion, 26-8.</page><page sequence="23">KANT'S THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 419 nothing about the wiU's freedom, we can only assume it. AU we can see is that the wiU has an ineradicable propensity (Hang) to evU that can be activated at any moment, and without necessarily being appar ent in our actions. In any given situation we can never be sure if the good or ev? principle has won out. This horrible propensity to evU is what Kant caUs the "foul stain of our species" and the source of our "innate guilt."39 It means that since man can never fuUy know his own heart, he must become his own moral sentry, always on the qui vive. Hope and Fear. Hope and fear are the dynamic forces of Chris tian moral psychology. Christians fear God's righteous judgment be cause they are aware of their sinful inclinations and pride. Yet they also believe that God sent a Redeemer whose grace now justifies and sanctifies them in His eyes. The doctrine is difficult and, as Kant him self points out, morally dangerous, since it can be taken to mean ei ther that our account with God can be settled for us, that we can work off our debt through rites and sacraments (means of grace, media sa lutis), or that we can be transformed instantaneously by a mysterious infilling of grace. If the forces of hope and fear are equaUy balanced they can support mora?ty; if one dominates the other, they can under mine it. The history of Christian heresies is the history of exaggerated hope or fear. Kant cannot abide fear. If human autonomy means anything, it must mean freedom from fear?the fear of men, the fear of govern ments, the fear of God. Kant even caUs the fear of God the suicide of reason, which is why his God has no face: as Spinoza was first to ob serve, we cannot fear what we cannot imagine. Kant's God has been reUeved of his arbitrary will (Willk?r) to aid or punish, he has been made to forswear miracles and mysteries, has become deaf to flattery, and no longer requires sacrifices. His existence cannot be proved, nor disproved; His ways cannot be justified or criticized. God made us, but He does not need us. Which might also imply that we do not need Him. This is not Kant's view, however, nor can it be. As we have noted, Kant's conception of moral autonomy is such that moral man actuaUy has a greater need for justification and hope than the Christian does. Consider his predicament. He has become fully responsible for his ac tions, at every moment, and can no longer shift responsibiUty back to 39 Religion, 30, 39-44, and 71.</page><page sequence="24">420 MARK LILLA original sin or plead extenuating circumstances. If something is a duty it is, by definition, possible now.40 Further, he can no longer con duct a proxy war against evil by stifling the inclinations of his body. Instead he finds himself responsible for maintaining the correct order of incentives in his heart, whose workings are obscure to him. Fi nally, he has been denied all heteronomous dependence on Christian dogmas that once offered false hope of justification. A Christian who despairs of overcoming the power of sin is taught to have faith in a willful but just God who gives the power of grace and the gift of atone ment, and accepts the sacrament of penance. The autonomous man who finds himself free from these superstitious dogmas also finds he must now bear alone all the burdens God once helped him carry. In the beginning, God justified man; later, in the age of theodicy, man justified God. Now that man has reached the age of majority he must justify himself. Moreover, as Kant says, man's own reason is the sternest judge. Its judgment is all the more crushing if no appeal is possible.41 If the autonomous moral life is a struggle between the forces of pride and humility, it is no wonder that Kant beUeves it carries with it anxiety, guilt, and hopelessness. Man is only too aware of his guilt, which is an infinite guilt because it arises from our infinite freedom. Freedom means he can never make up for the evils he has already committed. It also means accepting the fact that he is duty-bound to pursue self-perfection even though he knows that end cannot be at tained. The moral man will rightly fear death, not because he holds dearly to life; life is, after all, "less than nothing" in Kant's view.42 No, the moral man fears that death will cut short his failed pursuit of self perfection. His fear of death is a moral fear. He is tormented by words of St. Paul, made all the more tormenting by Kant's interpola tion: "there is none righteous (in the spirit of the law), no, not one."43 Homo Post-Christianus. Autonomous man lives in fear and trembling no less than the Christian believer. Perhaps more, since ^Religion, 39^2, 50, and 62. 41 Religion, 70.

The moral law, which moves him by humili ating him, also reminds him that he will never be humble enough, and that he alone bears the burden of guilt for this. Man is naturally shameless, as Augustine believed. Yet man is also naturally ashamed of his shamelessness, as Pelagius believed. This is a novel position in the history of modern moral thought, and it leads Kant to take other novel positions, beginning with religion. The task of religion as he sees it is to regulate the natural dialect of pride and humility, shame and shamelessness, so that it encourages the pursuit of the highest good. Kant is not above letting self-contempt play a role in our moral education, since "every good moral disposition can be grafted onto it."44 Yet he is concerned that self-contempt not rob us of the confi dence we need to keep improving ourselves. The postulates of immor tality and God are the most Kant can offer to meet this threat. They are, to say the least, ghostly humanistic substitutes for the real thing. In fact, there is no resurrection of the dead or God to whom we can turn. The Holy Spirit has been abolished and moral conscience must now become our Paraclete. There is no redeemer; we must redeem ourselves. Nor can our redemption take place through a single act of will. After the decision for morality, the Passion of autonomous moral man has just begun. For him, every day is Calvary.45 If there is any comfort to be found in these postulates it is cold in deed. If we have difficulty taking them seriously as theology, how ever, they must be taken seriously as a novel and highly developed psychological doctrine about the nature of homo religiosus. What makes religion possible, in Kant's view, is that reason has needs. Some of these needs are conditional and draw only a few into meta physical speculation. Others are unconditional because they arise from the necessary practical employment of reason, and therefore dis pose us all to moral religion, which is the only rational way to satisfy them. There are many such needs of reason, but the greatest of these is hope. We need hope, not simply because we are naturally evil and 43 Religion, 39. Kant's leading theological disciple later congratulated him on having put man's infinite guilt on firmer philosophical grounds than even the doctrine of original sin.

We are ashamed of our shamelessness and despair of overcoming it. This de spair is, so to speak, a natural Pelagian reaction to our Augustinian na ture. It is not a Christian conception of man's need for re?gion, but neither is it entirely unchristian. For the sake of economy, let us caU it post-Christian. And now let us see how Kant's poUtical theory re sponds to the needs and dangers of homo post-Christianus. IV Christianismus repristinatus. Kant writes two exp?citly theo logical-political treatises in his last years: Religion within the Bound aries of Mere Reason (1793) and The Conflict of the Faculties (1798). In many respects these are conventional EnUghtenment works. Kant's target is the unholy alUance of priests, princes, and professors who have rendered Christian Europe a violent and ignorant continent; his aim is to help liberate Europeans from their grasp. Kant's view of the Christian churches of his time is hardly flattering. He sees no es sential difference between European prelates and Siberian shamans who rule both church and state, nor between black-clad Puritans and pagan Finns who place bear claws upon their heads.46 In his eyes Christianity has become just another cult selling its services to those in power and justifying itself with specious theology. Kant's propos als for breaking this theological-poUtical aUiance are also conven tional in the main. He would remove all clerical influence from the state, limit the state's control over churches to a poUcing function, make the churches financiaUy independent, permit theological dis pute in private, and end all pubUc discrimination against particular faiths.47 Universities would be reformed to permit the ph?osophical faculty the independence necessary to become a loyal "left-wing" op position to the theologians, the clergy, and the government.48 The churches would also be reformed, though not necessarily in structure. They would instead be reformed doctrinaUy by means of a new sci ence of biblical interpretation that would seek an exclusively human 46Religion, 176-181; Faculties, 29-32. 47 Faculties, 21, 59-60, 65, and 57; Metaphysics of Morals, 326-8, and 368-9. 48Faculties, 21-4, and 27-36.</page><page sequence="27">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 423 istic moral teaching in scripture, even at the risk of textual or histori cal inaccuracy. The central doctrine to be reinterpreted would be that of Christ, who henceforth would be treated as a mere symboUc repre sentation of an archetype of human moral perfection already present in the minds of creatures endowed with reason.49 Yet if these criticisms and proposals now strike us as conven tional, the grounds on which Kant made them were not. Although the modern Epicureans reached many of the same conclusions by reduc ing Christianity to religion, and re?gion to fear and ignorance, Kant based his on a wholly new interpretation of man's religious nature and how Christianity expresses it. This new interpretation issued in two principles that governed Kant's theological-political program and that of his modern successors. The first principle was that religion could contribute to human self-improvement. The standard view among Kant's en?ghtened pre decessors was the modern Epicurean one that re?gion was, at best, a necessary ev? whose only potential utiUty was as a tool for assuring political obedience. Religion as such, and especiaUy the Christian re? gion, was the enemy of human enUghtenment, the very Kingdom of Darkness. Kant finds himself unable to reach such a categorical judg ment. Having established the inescapabi?ty of metaphysics for all rea sonable creatures, he opens the door, at least in principle, to a meta physica?y repristinized re?gion that stays within reason's bounds. Further, by estabUshing the inescapable moral need for the postulates of God and immortaUty on the basis of natural pride (Augustine) and natural humUity (Pelagius), Kant specificaUy opens the door to a mor aUy repristinized Christianity that balances these two natural qua?ties. The second new principle to be found in Kant's theological-poUti cal writings is that repristinized re?gion, whatever its content, must be universal in form. The only decent re?gion is a world-historical one. This is a logical conclusion of Kant's analysis of religion as a moral phenomenon. Kantian morality is not only universal, universalization is its essence. If religion contributes to the pursuit of the highest good, and if this pursuit is a universal moral end for man, re?gion con tributes to that human end. And if man as a moral creature must be 49 Religion, 61-6, 107, and 109-14; Faculties, 38-47.

Now that Christianity has failed morally as a theocentric re?gion, humanistic post-Christianity can, again in principle, accept its mantle and become the new universal faith.50 The rebirth of Christianity out of the spirit of Enlightenment was surely not what Kant had in mind. Yet his analysis of homo religiosus made such an aspiration philosophically respectable, and in theologi cal and political matters philosophical respectability has a way of translating into institutional reality. What is most striking about his theological-po?tical tracts, reread in the light of his re?gious science, is how far Kant himself actually advances in this direction. Moreover, it is not an altogether Uberal direction. The Three Swords. For Kant's modern predecessors the political problem of Christianity was that of divided loyalties. Christianity be ing a suprapolitical faith, it is hardly surprising that Christians make bad citizens. Either they believe they are pUgrims in the City of Man, just passing through, or they are convinced they can bring the City of God down to earth by political means. To address the specifically Christian problem of divided loyalties and encourage the virtues of good citizenship, modern thinkers explored two reforms: the reestab lishment of national civil religion and the institution of re?gious toler ation. Kant rejects both these options as insufficient. His objection to the idea of a revived Caesaropapism is the standard one made by the partisans of toleration as well: who will guard the guardians? His ar gument against mere toleration is different. As a political principle toleration is good, as a moral one it is suspect. For although tolera tion may keep religious disputes from endangering the peace, it may also leave individuals in the grasp of their private superstitions and moral corruptions. Dogmatic fanatics wish to enslave each other; pri 50 This ambition was expressed with admirable clarity early in our cen tury by the last great representative of Uberal Protestant theology: "Der reine, seine Giltigkeit nur in sich selbst tragende Vernunftglaube bedarf zur historischen Wirksamkeit des Kirchenglaubens als Vehikel, und der Kirch englaube geht unbewusst aus der im Psychologischen wirkenden und in ihm sich gestaltenden religi?sen Vernunft hervor. Daher gilt es rightige Einklei dung des Vernunftglaubens und richtige Auslegung des Kirchenglaubens"; Ernst Troeltsch, "Das Historische in Kants religionsphilosophie," Kant-Stu dien 9 (1904): 151.</page><page sequence="29">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 425 vate illuminati enslave themselves. So it is not enough that the churches be kept out of political life, and the hand of the state be kept from religion. Given the moral necessity of some kind of faith, church doctrines must themselves be held to the standard of moral autonomy. Yet who can control the churches if not the state? There are, after all, only two swords. So Kant invents a third. He does this in a long section of Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason in which he introduces the idea of an "ethical state of nature."51 Considered politically, the dy namics of the state of nature teach us the necessity of coercive public laws. Considered ethically, however, a state of nature exists when ever individuals, even within a political state, are not members of the same "church," that is, do not recognize a common authority over mo rality. This means that even if the public peace is maintained through law, the moral state of man will decline as social interaction trans forms man's naturally good inclinations into wicked ones. FoUowing Rousseau closely, Kant here portrays society as morally corrupting when men are left to their own devices. Yet in Kant's view the en forcement of private morality is not strictly speaking a political mat ter?given that morality is, by definition, non-coercive?a different sort of community must be formed to guide it. This he calls an ethical commonwealth or ethical community (ethisches gemeines Wesen).52 Confronted with the moral dangers of the ethical state of nature, we are aU obliged to join an ethical community that promotes the good principle and reduces the Ukelihood of our exciting the evil principle in each other. This commonwealth is not po?tical, it is not a govern ment, it claims no sovereignty. The ethical commonwealth is, at most, a "people of God" living under ethical laws within an organized church. One can see why Kant puts forward this fiction. It reflects his firmly held view that the moral improvement of man must be treated as a task that transcends church and state, and that these institutions only serve human interests to the extent that they approach the stan dard of this imaginary ethical commonwealth. Such a concept still keeps church and state separate, since they are based on two entirely 51 Religion, 95-124. 52 Compare Lessing, "On the Origin of Revealed Religion," in Lessing's Theological Writings, ed. Henry Chadwick (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1956), 104-5.</page><page sequence="30">426 MARK LILLA different kinds of law. And as an ideal it prevents both church and state from claiming absolute authority over morality, since neither can expect to achieve the absolute moral perfection of this ideal. It is in his defense of the ethical commonwealth against church and state that Kant again reminds us of the "crooked timber of humanity," from which nothing straight can be built. Yet it is hard to imagine Kant not also seeing that his giant leap forward for morality could also be interpreted as a step back into the po?tical problematic of Christianity from which the modern Epicure ans had tried to extricate Europe. By imagining an ideal common wealth that is, by definition, suprapolitical, and using it as a standard by which to judge real, existing social institutions, Kant has revived the problem of dual loyalties. Indeed, he has compounded it, since the ethical commonwealth is also transconfessional, and therefore can be seen as a threat to both church and state. Kant admits as much when he states that the knees of both priests and princes must now bend before the philosophers' rational moral interpretation of scripture. Caesar non est supra grammaticos, and neither is the pope.53 The Church Triumphant. The moral faith as Kant imagines it is not an organized, institutional religion. It is a stealth re?gion whose believers are to be found everywhere working toward the same end: the rationalization of faith and the moral improvement of humanity. Its institutions are inward, its tenets nothing more than the moral law revealed to all rational creatures. Its only "official" is God himself, conceived as the moral ruler of the world. If there is a "people of God" it is this cosmopolitan, not to say Masonic, society of the mor aUy faithful working to bring all existing religions into line. Kant even claims that its historical mission is more significant than that of inter national law. While international law can establish cosmopolitan rela tions among states under differing political laws, only the laws of the ethical commonwealth embrace the whole of humanity. The ethical commonwealth is, of course, a fiction, an ideal. But from this ideal Kant derives certain duties, among them the duty to join a church. His concern seems to be that the morally faithful will quit the churches, leaving to Providence the task of propagating the 53 An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment? (hereafter "En lightenment") m Practical Philosophy, 39.</page><page sequence="31">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 427 faith. Kant would compel them to come in. To this end he distin guishes between the "invisible" moral church that serves as an ideal, from the "visible" church that one day might harmonize with that ideal. He then announces the universal moral duty to transform the ecclesiastical faiths into this "visible church." To be clear, Kant does not (with one exception) call for conversion from one particular faith to another. He has in mind instead a process of reform and criticism, especially scriptural criticism, that will lead every faith to shed its re vealed, empirical trappings and express the same rational moral doc trines.54 How seriously are we meant to take this as a concrete program of reform? Kant insists that the ethical state cannot be estabUshed on earth without a pubUc foothold. Yet he is also careful to add that the "millenium" he describes is a moral one, not a historical or denomina tional one, that it is a merely regulative idea giving a rational end to human striving in history. The end of aU our striving must of course be conceived as the "Church Triumphant," otherwise our reformist ac tivities would be irrational. Until that church is bu?t, however, the morally faithful must attach themselves to imperfect ecclesiastical ones. During this period of waiting and expectation, as each church seeks self-purification, it becomes a "Church Militant" that takes itself to be the "True Church" and engages in controversy with other churches over dogma. These conflicts are to be governed by the strict conventions of rational scriptural interpretation, but they remain con flicts and are to be welcomed.55 This is a surprising conclusion. It turns out that the ethical per fection of humanity in history, no less than its poUtical perfection, wiU depend on the "unsocial sociabiUty" of homo religiosus. Until the "visible" moral church is estabUshed, each ecclesiastical faith wiU be competing for this title?competing for a universal end but under its own banner. Only when victory is gained at the vanishing point of world history wiU aU banners be furled.56 Catholicismus rationalis. "There is only one (true) re?gion but there can be several kinds of faith."57 The distinction between univer sal moral re?gion and ecclesiastical faith is fundamental in Kant's ^Religion, 94,96,100-1, and 151-2. ^Religion, 105,115,121-2, and 136. MPeaee, 367. 57Religion, 108.</page><page sequence="32">428 MARK LILLA treatises. This would seem to imply that Kant is indifferent to distinc tions among faiths, since they all fall short of true religion. After all, what really separates Catholic from Protestant, Christian from Jew and Muslim? Only history, which has arbitrarily shaped their dogmas. Once those accidents of history are transcended men will share a reli gion in which there is neither Lutheran nor Calvinist, gentile nor Jew, and become a people of God united under the rational moral law. If Kant is indifferent to distinctions among the historical dogmas of the faiths, it seems he should be indifferent to Christianity's claim to distinction. He certainly casts doubts on the claims Christianity makes for itself. Its truths may very well have been revealed to man, he admits, but man could not possibly have understood those truths since finite creatures are incapable of experiencing revelation. So revelation cannot be a criterion of judgment. Instead, Kant proposes that we adopt the standard of natural moral religion and examine Christianity in this light. Considered as an organized church, all faiths look alike because they are all based on historical facta. Christian ity's factum just happens to be Jesus. The real test, however, is to ex amine the moral teachings of Christianity and judge them in the light of the one true religion. Kant conducts such a test and, to no one's surprise, Christianity passes.58 He reviews the Sermon on the Mount and finds in it a call to moral autonomy and the pursuit of the highest good. He examines the archetype of Jesus, whose descent to us symbolizes the fact that mor ally-perfected mankind is the aim of Creation. Jesus is a God-man, re flecting our own mixed nature as potentiaUy good and evil creatures. Jesus was tempted by the evil principle but rejected it in favor of the good. He stood against the purely external and civU conception of the divine law and the pseudo-services of his time and revealed the moral law within. For this he suffered humiliation for the sake of righteous ness. One can hardly expect an enUghtened thinker, some of whose re ligious writings had already been censored, to say anything less. Kant does the decent thing. The closer we examine his statements on Christianity, however, the more it appears that Kant went beyond the caU of duty. To interpret Christianity in a deistic fashion as a moral faith is one thing, to interpret it as the quintessence of moral faith 58 Religion, 155-63; also 60-5, and 80-3.</page><page sequence="33">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 429 quite another. Yet this is what Kant implies when he calls Christianity the 'first true Church" (die erste wahre Religion), the "most adequate form" of faith (die schichtlichte Form), and indeed the very "Idea" of religion (das Christentum ist die Idee von Religion).59 Is he simply pandering to his Christian readers? Protecting himself against the censors? Or are these statements, however strategically employed, in fact perfectly consistent with his psychological and moral analysis of homo Christianus? The question of Christianity's uniqueness gains in clarity when we examine his treatment of its history, particularly in relation to Juda ism.60 Kant turns to Judaism less out of fairness or wissenschaftliche thoroughness than out of a need to explain the embarrassing fact of Christianity's Jewish roots. To find those roots he turns first to the Book of Genesis (which he inexplicably relegates to the "Christian portion" of Scripture). He begins with the story of the fallen angel, which he takes to symbo?ze the eternal struggle between the good principle (God) and the evil principle (Satan) for dominion over man. The gentiles became subjects of the Kingdom of Evil while the Jews were destined, at least initially, for rule by the Good. Given human weakness, however, the Jewish theocracy departed almost immedi ately from strictly moral principles, embellishing them with demean ing ceremonies and demanding strict observance of arbitrary man made laws. For centuries the Jews lived in this amoral political order until, one day, they became dissatisfied with it. (Following Lessing, Kant suggests this happened under the influence of Greek philoso phy.61) They were ripe for spiritual revolution. At this juncture Jesus happened to appear, preaching the eternal gospel of reason and the need to choose between the principles of good and evil. His appear ance did not mark yet another dispensation in the line of Jewish ones. It marked the first human articulation of supra-political moral religion that in principle has always been available. Yet for understandable historical reasons, early Christianity and even Jesus himself were forced to speak the language of Jewish messianism if they hoped to win adherents. The Christian Church Fathers should have been able to distinguish the moral core of Jesus's teaching from its messianic 59Religion, 159; Faculties, 36, and 44. ^Religion, 124-31. 61 "The Education of the Human Race," in Lessing's Theological Writ ings, Propositions 32-42.</page><page sequence="34">430 MARK LILLA sheU, but failed to. Instead they accepted the Jewish account of God's continuous revelation, binding the Hebrew Bible and the Gospels to gether and papering over the obvious fissures with scholastic casu istry. Thus did Christianity become the miscegenous offspring of ra tional mora?ty and Jewish heteronomy.62 Yet aU was not lost. Although Christian doctrine lost its strictly moral focus it did retain the universal ambition that aU genuine moral re?gion must have. Furthermore, although it retained its messianic base, it acquired a unique eschatological form that could be universal ized, which was a unique and genuine advance for the human race. The aim of religious reform, and specificaUy the reform of Christian ity, wiU not be to force the churches to abandon such claims, but rather to fulfill them. In principle, the pure moral religion ought to be what Kant calls a catholicismus rationalise Such a religion can have no sects, for sectarianism can only arise if we bring a?en pagan elements into it. Even the enlightened principle of toleration Kant considers only conditionally good to the degree that it offers a visible sign of our political freedom. As a doctrinal matter, toleration is to be resisted. "The conclusion of the great drama of re?gious change on earth (the restoration of all things)" will only take place, Kant writes, "when there w?l be only one shepherd and one flock."64 The Euthanasia of Judaism. Statements such as these should probably be interpreted to mean that Kant would only consider reli gious history at a close when re?gion as we have come to know it is replaced by a universaUy-recognized rational mora?ty. Yet until that end is reached the problem of toleration remains. Kant seems to think that toleration between Catho?cs and Protestants might be mor ally fruitful by teaching them to see the idiosyncrasies of their own dogmas while stiU "looking upon each other as brothers in faith." Tol eration between Christians and Jews is another matter, however. For not only is Christianity the 'first true church," this church was also exp?citly established to do away with the tutelage of heteronomous Jewish law. While it is possible to imagine individual Jews becoming brothers and sisters in a universal moral re?gion, it is hard to imagine Judaism being reformed in this direction without it ceasing to be Ju 62 Religion, 79, and 166-7.

Kant cannot but see the existence of European Jewry as a throwback to a premoral age of humanity. This is clear in his running dispute with Moses Mendelssohn over whether Jews ought to convert to Christianity, an idea to which the enlightened Jewish philosopher maintained a stiff-necked resistance. As a compromise Kant put for ward the proposal of his own disciple Lazarus Ben David that Jews be encouraged to embrace Christianity publicly while maintaining a "Jewish" interpretation of the Scriptures (the Torah and the Gospels, Kant specifies). Such an arrangement would preserve the freedom of individual Jews while still assuring, in Kant's singularly unhappy phrase, "the euthanasia of Judaism."65 The abolition of this pre-moral messianic faith would prepare the way for the eschatological moral re ligion. Awaiting the Last Days. Kant is hardly interested in leading a Kulturkampf, least of all in the name of Christianity. He tells the Christian churches in no uncertain terms that the hearts and minds of modern men can only be gained by becoming worthy of love. The true catholic church must be built through liberality. Anything less would cast Christianity itself in the apocalyptical role of the Antichrist and precipitate the moral "end of all things."66 Still, one wonders whether Kant fully appreciated the theological and political possibilities his new approach to religion had opened. Let us presume that the aim of his late writings on religion is to nudge the Christian churches in the direction of a more enlightened, liberal minded, morality-centered faith that we here have called post-Chris tianity. This transformation is presented by Kant as a single, progres sive historical process that would gradually reform the churches from within so that they offered moral support to republics that themselves were becoming more enlightened. In fact Kant has outlined two his torical processes that are to work in tandem. One is the progressive de-Christianization of Europe; the other is the progressive post Christianization of Europe. The implications of these two movements are very different. The de-Christianization of society would mean the gradual withering away of the churches and with them fanaticism and religious conflict. Its 65Faculties, 53. More generally, see Faculties, 48-53, and Religion, 136 7, and 166. 66 The End of All Things, in Religion and Rational Theology, 336-9.</page><page sequence="36">432 MARK LILLA post-Christianization, on the other hand, could plausibly mean a new role for the churches as the moral guardians of modern society. The question is: WiU Europe first be de-Christianized or post-Christian ized? The more rational and moral the churches become, the less they rely on revelation and authority, the greater their claim wiU be to contribute to the highest ends of the human race. By Umiting religion to inner morality Kant has struck a blow against Christianity; by ele vating mora?ty to the ultimate aim of human activity, indeed of cre ation itself, he has simultaneously promoted the post-Christian church into the historical vanguard, even before politics. In Kant's view politics can contribute only indirectly to the moral improvement of man. Reformed religion contributes to it directly through a supra political, if ideal, ethical commonwealth. In the context of Kant's phi losophy of history, this implies either that there is no ultimate theo logical-poUtical problem in Europe, since the aims of en?ghtened Christianity and enlightened politics are the same. Or, if conflict does appear, then politics must be legitimately subordinated to the moral aims of repristinized Christianity. Kant did not explore these possibilities, but every nineteenth century German ph?osopher and theologian of the first rank did. What they thought they learned from Kant can be summed up in a common French phrase: reculer pour mieux sauter. WhUe Kant's philosophy robbed Christianity of the doctrinal crutches on which it had lazily leaned in the pre-modern era, his moral theology demon strated in unassailably modern terms that re?gion was a permanent human need and that Christianity, properly reformed, was the re?gion most suited to man's moral improvement. Christianity and modernity were not antagonists, they were partners in a grand historical drama. The most influential Kantian theologian of the nineteenth century, Al brecht Ritschl, was far from voicing a minority opinion when he de clared Kant to have made possible "the practical restoration of Protes tantism" in the modern age.67 So widespread was this view that Nietzsche declared in disgust (and specifically with reference to Kant) that Protestantism was the peccatum originale of German ph?oso phy, and represented "the partial paralysis of Christianity?and of rea son."68 67 Ritschl, The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation, 1:389.</page><page sequence="37">KANTS THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL REVOLUTION 433 It is little exaggeration to say that in nineteenth-century Germany the question of Christianity's place in modern society was the domi nant issue in political philosophy, to the exclusion of virtually all oth ers. Will enlightened modern Europe be a continent without Chris tianity, or will it be the continent of modern enlightened Christianity? Liberal theologians from Schleiermacher to Ernst Troeltsch endorsed the second view, anti-theologians like Feuerbach and Marx endorsed the first. Hegel seemed to endorse both, which is less mad than it ap pears. For in fact these two views share a fundamental assumption, along with Kant, which is that Christianity represented an utterly new dispensation and that the modern age is its historical culmination. Whether the Calvary of reason represents the death and crucifixion of Christianity, or its resurrection and ascension, is the last remaining mystery. Studying Kant's revolution in religious science in this light we are led to consider how it might have contributed to the transformation of po?tical philosophy in modern Germany.69 This transformation be gins immediately after Kant and the effects are immediately apparent. Throughout the nineteenth century English liberals trained in gentle manly modern Epicureanism remained committed to prophylactic therapy. They continued to reflect on how to control the religious pas sions, how to separate church and state, and on the limits of tolera tion. French republicans, responding to Voltaire's less po?te ?crasez!, conducted a war of attrition against clericalism. Even parti sans of August Comte's religion of humanity, which was buUt on a sci ence of the passions, were at bottom Epicureans. Yet German pl?los ophy and theology took a different turn after Kant. There the central questions of the modern liberal tradition?the passions, institutions, toleration?were subordinated to the historical question of Christian ity's contribution to modern life. After seventeenth-century English thinkers debated the reasonableness of Christianity, German thinkers of the nineteenth announced the discovery of reason in Christianity. Reason was Christianity's "essence," and this essence was "abso lute"?hence the "absoluteness of Christianity" of which Hegel, Tro 68 Nietzsche, The AntiChrist in The Portable Nietzsche, trans.

Most of these thinkers were not traditional Christians by any stretch of the imagination. They were post-Chris tians who looked forward to the time when a? of Christianity's "val ues" would have been "secularized," compensating for the "death of God." For them, the serious study of modern poUtics did not imply learning how to control and divert the re?gious passions. The secret of po?tical Ufe was to be found in the depths of re?gion, and the se cret of re?gion to be found in the idea of Christianity. Students of Kant have long asked themselves why Kant never wrote a systematic work on politics that might be compared with those of Hobbes and Locke or Montesquieu and Rousseau. They have scoured his writings?in history, law, ethics, aesthetics, anthropol ogy?for glimmers of what might have been. For some reason it never occurs to them to begin with his writings on religion. Were they to begin there, they would discover a systematic way of thinking about the original problem of modern political philosophy?homo Christianus?that renders systematic thinking about politics of sec ondary importance. This way of thinking would remain attractive so long as it could be assumed that Christianity and modern society shared a common destiny. When, in the aftermath of the First World War, that conviction was irretrievably lost, a new conception of the theological-poUtical problem would be born, one whose effects we are stiU feeling.
