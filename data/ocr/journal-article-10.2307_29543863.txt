<plain_text><page sequence="1">THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME In September 1992 the Architecture Foundation announced a competition for the design of a Foyer to be situated in the centre of Birmingham. The judges were Sir Christopher Benson, Tessa Blackstone, David Chipperfield, Sir Norman Foster, and Doris Lockhart Saatchi. First prize was awarded to the Manchester practice Ian Simpson Associates and the twelve finalists9 entries were exhibited at the Architecture Foundation. Three of these are discussed by DAVID TURNBULL below, and illustrated in the pages following. Britain's Foyers, to which the Housing Corporation allocated ?1 million for a pilot project in 1992, are modelled on the French Foyers des Jeunes Travaillers, and represent a new form of shared housing. The aim is to provide young people with a secure environment during the transition from 'home' to independent living, in purpose-built accommodation. Training, help with finding jobs, and recreational and leisure facilities are also provided. The idea is to support and assist rather than direct the young 'workers' in their personal development. The extent of such support and assistance is agreed between each new entrant and the Foyer staff. Prior to the competition a 'client' had been selected from a group of housing associations and other agencies who were invited to make submissions. This role was given to the Birmingham housing association SHAPE, who own a vacant site next to their Snow Hill Centre (a hostel for homeless men), at the intersection of the Birmingham and Foxeley Canal, the railway viaduct leading to Snow Hill Station, and Water Street. As described in the competition brief, written by SHAPE in conjunction with the Architecture Foundation, the Foyer is a building type that has both a private and a public dimension. While the bedrooms constitute the private space, the communal areas ? television lounges, cafe, restaurants, workshops and AA FILES 26 teaching areas ? supply the essential point of contact between residents and staff, and between the Foyer and the outside world. It is this relationship which establishes the Foyer as a novel form of institution. A Foyer is not a hotel or a hostel or a boarding house, nor is it a monastery or a school, yet it does have some of the characteristics of all of these. While the housing association would clearly like to deny, or at least to play down, its institutional character, the provision of twenty four-hour security, video surveillance and a degree of 'care' ensures that this is unavoidable. Like many British cities Birmingham grew out of an agglomeration of small towns and villages. Since the eighteenth century it has been an important centre for the manufacture of jewellery and precious metals, but as Jane Jacobs explained in The Economy of Cities (1969) it has always been difficult to generalize about Birmingham's economy. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was based on the manufacture of saddles and harnesses, tools, buckles, buttons and glass; in the nineteenth, guns and machine tools. In contrast to Manchester, with its exceptionally efficient textile industry, Birmingham possessed a heterodox mixture of inefficient small businesses which depended on their ability to diversify and develop rather than to expand. These continued to multiply and to thrive, and by the 1960s two cities in particular, London and Birmingham, remained economically vigorous and prosperous, establishing an industrial axis along the Ml motorway. Both cities had expanded rapidly. The 1946 New Towns Act designated this a 'problem' and attempted to shift some of the population of Birmingham to the new towns of Telford and Redditch. However, the West Midlands conurbation (as it came to be known) continued to grow. Birmingham reputedly has more canals than Venice, and it also has the best road and rail connections in Britain. Its monuments now include traffic systems and shopping precincts. In its present form the city could be seen in terms of a negotiation of place versus non place, the richly striated topography of nineteenth-century engineering works and isolated buildings balancing against more recent post-war construction, from the vast ? the Arena, the Bull Ring, the Convention Centre and the National Exhibition Centre ? to the more modest ? for example the jewellery quarter, which in the post-war period was the subject of numerous local planning studies. One of the most dramatic of these was When We Build Again (1941), by the Bournville Village Trust, which idealistically proposed a 'new' planned environment based on fresh air, daylight, health and hygiene: in place of densely packed Victorian buildings, parallel blocks of five-story workshops rigorously organized in strips flanking municipal recreation grounds. The Birmingham Jewellery and Silversmiths' Association's plans which were carried out from 1943 to 1955, though less radical, were later censured for what had come to be regarded as their damaging consequences. In 1980 redevelopment of this quarter was abandoned in favour of gradual 'improvement', encouraging tourism and ? as the remaining fragments of the productive nineteenth-century fabric are conserved and consumed as a picture of the past ? what the sociologist Sharon Zukin, in Postmodern Urban Landscapes (1991), calls 'spatial appropriation'. The coincidence in Birmingham of the rise of an image-based logic of production and consumption with the condemnation of modernist erasure and replacement strategies, the post-war emphasis on the efficient transformation of infrastructure, and contingent, localized building operations now leads the city irrevocably towards a condition which Anthony Vidier, in Posturbanism (1992) (quoting Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities), attributes to the post-urban domain ? the city with no name: 'Like all big cities it consists of irregularity, change, sliding forward, not keeping in step, collisions of things and affairs and fathomless points of silence in between.' 11</page><page sequence="2">For Catrina Beevor and Robert Mull the Foyer is 'a normal part of the city, but one in which the rules of every-day life that usually act against young people have been temporarily and decisively altered in their favour'. An explicit aim is the definition of a prototype which uses a 'stereotypical house' as its model and emphasizes 'normal domestic strategies'. The 120 bedrooms are equally divided among three 'Lodges', while the social life of the residents, the Tribes', takes place at street and canal level. This area, designated the 'Landscape', is conceived of as a meeting-ground between the Lodges, and between the Foyer and the city. Beevor and Mull were among the founders in 1983 of NATO (Narrative Architecture Today). Their contributions to the 'Gamma City' and 'Albion' issues of the NATO magazine introduce themes which, although developed more rigorously in their recent work ? for instance in the Colville pub, Notting Hill, or the Orinoco Studios, clearly indicate a particular approach: the use of games and an evident fascination with technologies both primitive and advanced, invariably used in ways that confound conventional expectations. As the NATO group began to break up, and their graphic and constructional mannerisms were themselves consumed, Beevor and Mull (the latter now teaching in the AA Diploma School with Carlos Villanueva-Brandt) were compelled to formulate their own position. Their work now refocused on a psycho geographic reading of the city. Not surprisingly, the counter-modern strategies advocated by the Situationists and their attacks on the culture of the spectacle supplied the theoretical underpinnings and supported a hoped-for radicalism and political relevance within the context of Britain in the late 1980s. Beevor and Mull are part of the third generation of an A A 'family' originating in Bernard Tschumi's work with Diploma School Unit 10, and it may be pertinent that the search for limits, boundaries and their transgression, the destabilization of meanings and the attention given to 'events', should be explicitly relocated in the practices of the derive, the detournement and the 'constructed situation'. The derive as codified by Guy Debord before 1957, with its antagonistic yet close relation to surrealism, and including directions on the use of chance, aimed at developing 'a mode of experimental behaviour linked to the condition of urban society'. The technique of detournement actively reinscribed meaning into objects and texts to construct 'situations', which were defined as 'moments of life, concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a play of events'. The occupants of Beevor and Mull's Foyer would find themselves in just such a constructed situation, their principal activity, 12 like that of the inhabitants of Ivan Chtcheglov's (alias Gilles Ivain) town described in Formula for a New Urbanism (1958) being a continuous derive. 'The changing of the landscape, hour by hour,' wrote Chtcheglov, is 'responsible for a complete depaysement.' This finds an eerie echo in Beevor and Mull's designation of the common areas of the Foyer as Landscape, as the appellation Tribes is not a consequence of a neo-primitive longing for rootedness and harmony with the earth, but rather a reflection of the occupants' nomadic or itinerant way of life. The endlessly variable and interactive combining and recombining of television and video imagery with electronically displayed slogans, icons, messages and announcements, together with the more limited but nevertheless adjustable variations in the spatial organization of the Landscape, embrace the random and the wayward, providing a technological interpretation of the 'carnivalesque' ? disrupting the every-day and turning authority on its head. The overarching theme is play, for the Situationists the antithesis of alienated labour, with the city as exposed by the derive serving as the board on which the game is played. The fact that this seems also to echo aspects of Cedric Price's Inter-Action Centre (1971) and the technotopias of Archigram cannot be overlooked. The 'dream' of proliferating social opportunities and cybernetic futures is here placed in ironic proximity to its 'reality': dispossessed and disempowered young people and the wreckage of homes and families. From this juxtaposition of dream and reality emerges the startling comparison proposed in Beevor and Mull's competition report between the Tribe and a formation of F-lll fighter-bombers ? evidently a reference to the 'fighting spirit' the occupants will need in order to progress 'onward and upward', like Marvel Comics (super)heroes. The detournement of images of battles or war machines had a crucial role in Situationist theory. Notably, Debord's last film, In Girum imus Nocte et Consumimur Igni (1981), included shots of a board game, Kriegspiel, developed by Debord based on Clausewitz's theory of war, and images of the Charge of the Light Brigade into the Valley of Death. However, the jingoism surrounding the Falklands War on one hand, and the erosion of Welfare State capitalism on the other, haunt the landscape of this Foyer and betray the paradoxical proximity of a repressed conservatism. Among the antecedents of the Lodges are the Masonic lodge, the intersection of public life and private ritual; the 'houses' of private education in Britain; and the high bourgeois mansions of the suburbs, with their garden gates, entrance halls and upstairs downstairs hierarchies, crowned by the combination of attic storage and playroom ? the locus of memory, childhood fantasies and family secrets, evocations of 'home'. These threaten to restabilize the otherwise 'radical' ambitions of the Situationist programme. The 'reality of actual struggle: politics . . . always takes place in the dirty risky space of uncertainty', Debord pointed out. 'Theoretical work has a tactical dimension. It is just one of many weapons in a revolutionary arsenal and like these it too must be deployed at a strategic moment.' But, as the palindromic title of his last film suggests, by 1978 the hopelessness of the present was for him best represented by 'the old phrase that circles back around itself completely' ? a labyrinth with no exit. Adam Caruso and Peter St John's proposal is both a paradigm and a paradox: like the model of the city of Ascoli in Carlo Crivelli's The Annunciation with St Emidius (1486), referring to the limited rights of self government granted to that city by the Pope in 1482, it is both idealized and a representation of the city as it is. The division of the building into towers, table and open-terraced undercroft rhymes with the topography of Central Birmingham, while (as is suggested by the inclusion in the introductory polemic submitted with their competition entry of a Werner Bischof photograph of a Japanese temple) a contemplative ideality informs the composition of their own offering to the city. As with the 'model' city, both the intimation of perfection and the possible or hoped-for congruence of the small and the large, the local and the universal, are hinted at. While Caruso and St John emphasize that they have no intention of trying to impose a Utopia, there are in both their statement and the project itself strong echoes of the 'Utopias of the present' of Team X, and the 'realism' of conceptual and minimal art of the 1960s. In the introduction to the catalogue of the 1969 T?te Gallery exhibition The Art of the Real, E. C. Goosen wrote that the 'real' as posited by the new art had nothing to do with metaphor, symbolism, or metaphysics. It did not wish to convey the notion that reality is somewhere else, nor was it related to the symbolic reality Malevich thought he had discovered when he first isolated a black square in a white field (1913). On the contrary, the art of the real made no direct appeal to the emotions, nor was it involved in uplift. It seemed to have no desire for self-justification, but instead offered itself 'in the form of the simple, irreducible, irrefutable object'. This exhibition, which showed minimalist works by Donald Judd, Robert Morris, John McCracken and others, alongside work by Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, is interesting in this context because, while Caruso and St John evidently pursue the simple, irrefutable quality that Goosen identified, this is complicated by the suspicion AA FILES 26</page><page sequence="3">that the symbolic reality of Malevich or the relationship that Lyotard identifies beween Newman's work and Renaissance paintings of the Annunciation or the Epiphany, however remote, is nevertheless hardly fully suppressed or avoided. Equally, Goosen's observation that there was no direct appeal to the emotions is undermined by the undeniable sensuality of Morris's larger works, the provocative relation of his sculptures to the spectator's body suggesting a complex, erotically charged level of confrontation. The volumetric simplicity of Caruso and St John's Foyer; the use of unfinished materials assembled with a high degree of tectonic rigour, thought in relation to the open space-planning of the lower areas; and the crosswall and infill arrangement of the upper levels also have affiliations with the post-CIAM work of Candilis, Josic and Woods, notably their scheme for Frankfurt-am-Main (1961-2), the 4web' plan of the Free University, Berlin (1963-), and the 4open architecture' of the Smithsons. This architecture was, the Smithsons suggested, 'never finished, never imposing a formal limit to the possibility of functional change and never reminiscent of a past social order, while at the same time grappling with issues of identification, and infrastructure'. Caruso and St John have explored open, poly centric forms in other recent projects. Their Open City plan (1992) for Karlsruhe extends Weinbrenner's nineteenth-century plan with a web of open but disciplined enclosures defined by roads, walls and planting, which gradually becomes less dense towards its outer edges. In the Foyer such openness is occluded by a De Stijl-like centripetal arrangement of level changes and furniture divisions. The public areas of this building are thought of as a landscape both open and closed, spatially continuous yet discrete, negotiating the middle ground between the unbounded space of the 'free plan' and the cellular, highly differentiated Raumplan. In its massing and materiality this proposal has the directness and psychosexual dimension of sculptures by Morris ? who on the occasion of his retrospective show at Castelli-Sonnabend in 1974 was photographed standing naked, except for a Nazi Storm Trooper's helmet, dark glasses and chains, as if to emphasize conceptual art's transgressive, anti-institutional ambitions, while at the same time acknowledging the power of institutional forms, and thereby catching in a sado-masochistic embrace two sides of the same coin. Caruso and St John's Foyer engages with a similar conundrum. It is both institutional and anti-institutional, open and closed, entwined with the city and idealized and separate from it. Like their plan for Karlsruhe, it recuperates the forms of the recent past, in this case the AA FILES 26 architecture of the Welfare State, and represents them almost as a rebuke, at a time when that state has been almost completely eradicated. Nasrine Seraji-Bozorgzad conceives of the Foyer as a large communal house, an urban house, facing onto a reinvented piece of the city, an 'espace trouve'. While some of the characteristic themes of modernism are worked out in her proposal (the dialectic of type and context; transparency both literal and phenomenal, here made explicit through the use of 'wire frame' computer models; an emphasis on light and air inside the building; an explicit instrumentalism), emerging from these is the destabilizing influence of the unconscious. It is here, in the interdependence of surrealism and modernism, that the urban 'house' and the 'espace trouve' are to be found. After completing her studies at the AA, Seraji moved from London to Paris in 1989. Two years later she won a competition for the design of temporary facilities for the American Cultural Centre in Paris, to be occupied while Frank Gehry's project was under construction. Flakeboard on timber studding, scaffold poles and weldmesh envelop a long, thin, triangular site. The building is incised so as to accommodate existing trees, and a narrow 'cour interieure', more like a passage, runs along the centre of the site. The construction techniques allude to the paraphernalia of the building site ? huts, hoardings, security fences, etc. Seraji folds and leans the form of her building, evoking nautical and zoomorphic associations that include both marine and land mammals which appear to be caught in a trap or a net. The ceiling of the 'cour interieure' is formed by an arrangement of sloped poles and covering of mesh which cuts across the sky. Here the 'submarine' rooms of Max Ernst's collage novel Une semaine de honte (1934) come to mind, while the interplay of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and mechanical associations recalls images from his earlier La Femme 100 tetes (1929), and recasts the perspectival 'passage', or 'cour interieure', as both the object of oneiric desire and prosthesis. Her Foyer project enlarges this investigation. The slack curves enclosing the 'espace trouve' evoke the egg-like forms of Arp. Enveloping curvature combines with a rigorous framework, bringing surrealist 'intrauterine architecture' and an evocation of the 'perverse' interiority of the nineteenth-century bourgeois home, as played out in the aequeous images of Une semaine de honte, into a relationship with the objectivity (Sachlichkeit) of its economic and structural efficiency. The suspended glass room, the 'fitness box' on top of the building, exploits both the myth of transparency as universal exteriority, and the exhilaration of reflectivity as spectacle, as exhibited by the 'Glassarchitektur' of Taut and Scheerbart. Thus the fantasy of a hedonistic interrelation of voyeurism and display is countered by the indifference of the 'man in the crowd'. Seraji's building is both separated (moated) from the city and transparent to it: it is a refuge and a showcase. The screen for video and film projection hung in the 'espace trouve' launches it into the domain of Fredric Jameson's surrealism without the unconscious. If, as he suggests, one of the characteristics of late-consumer or multinational capitalism is the disappearance of a sense of history, so that our society 'has begun to live in a perpetual present', and the surrealism of the unconscious has become the hyper-realism of the conscious, this Foyer enshrines a paradox: it is evidently resistant to, yet tacitly participates in, the apparent irredeemability of contemporary consumer culture. In all of these proposals an abstract notion of 'landscape' emerges as a central figure, in relation to the interior organization of the building, or in the building's relationship to its setting. Our present conception of landscape has evolved from the art historical definition applied to painting, to encompass among many possible meanings material culture and social process. For Sharon Zukin, following J. B. Jackson, landscape is built around dominant social institutions, in contrast to vernacular, which consitutes the self-built creations developed over time by ordinary people. For J. F. Lyotard in his lecture 'Scapeland' (1988), 'Landscape is the opposite of place and is antagonistic to it. Estrangement [depaysement] appears to be a precondition for landscape. Landscapes are disconcerting [depaysant] and without destiny, while a place is natural, a crossroads for the kingdoms and for homo sapiens.' The dissolution of place into non-place, or of vernacular into landscape, so evident in a city like Birmingham, has important implications for the Foyer project. By definition the housing association is itself deeply involved in the process of spatial transformation; the building of houses and the creation of jobs demands it. The Foyer has to negotiate a difficult path between institutional control and self determination. In a way, its programme demands that any design should engage directly in the antagonistic relationship between place and non-place. Each of the three proposals discussed here addresses this central issue. The strategies they adopt reflect in differing degrees their consciousness of and resistance to the collapse of place as a category. They are, however, pervaded by an overpowering sense of nostalgia of a different sort, an almost wistful longing for certain critical moments in the development of twentieth-century art and architecture, each one radical in its earlier manifestation, but now somehow hollow. 13</page><page sequence="4">Catrina Beevor &amp; Robert Mull ..: r :tr. u~ u: ?: itf tf tf tf.

This Foyer has two clear ambitions: to define a prototype for the British Foyers which is strong enough to resist the compromising effect of national funding and planning policy, and to apply this prototype to the Birmingham site. THE PROTOTYPE ? This Foyer is a normal part of the city, but one where the rules of everyday life, which usually act against young people, have been temporarily and decisively altered in their favour. ? This Foyer is a simple form that concentrates the existing forces of its host community into a laboratory for the formation of new patterns of adult life which are not necessarily dependent upon or comparable to conventional concepts of work and home. ? This Foyer is a proud citadel which uses architecture to proclaim the vitality, resourcefulness and resilience of its occupants. It is a place which is capable of generating so vigorous and engaging a culture that it will 14 AA FILES 26</page><page sequence="5">cease to be a mere staging-post and become a destination in its own right. ? This Foyer has its own economy which generates additional income for its users. It is cheap to build but comparatively expensive to maintain; over time, the saving in initial expenditure is released to the Foyer residents as a grant for building-maintenance, thereby enabling them to be fully involved in the upkeep of their own building. THE PROTOTYPE IN WATER STREET The building retains within a particular application the essence of a reusable and readily adaptable prototype. Its simple structural frame and sweeping roof of green zinc shelter a family of components and programmatic ideas which can be easily extracted and reapplied to other new-build or conversion projects in both urban and rural locations. The social life of the participants takes place downstairs, at street and canal levels. This zone we have named the Landscape. Individual study bedrooms are located on the upper five floors. These are arranged in three separate building compartments of forty rooms each, which we call the Lodges. THE LANDSCAPE PROTOTYPE The Landscape is a flexible but strident space. It is the meeting-ground between the individual Lodges, and between the world of the Foyer and the city which surrounds it. By virtue of its very character our design proposal offers flexibility over a variety of timescales. If social conditions change, the Foyer will not be invalidated by its architecture. The Landscape is an active space which demands that residents take control. With the flexibility of the architecture serving as a potent tool, they may bend and manipulate its hardware into ever more appropriate configurations that express the culture and identity of the Foyer. This exercise of working as a group to adapt the Landscape enables residents to acquire the sense of pride and social responsibility which is one of the fundamental aims of the Foyer programme. Within the Landscape of this protoype Foyer there is the Wall of Work, which responds to the hard fact that most Foyers will need to generate extra income. Part of the Landscape is therefore designated as raw space to let, enabling the host community to collaborate without condescension. For the Foyer residents the Wall of Work will not only act as a representation of the political and economic forces that will shape their adult lives, but will also be a part of that world domesticated and appropriated to the realization of their developing skills and interests. AA FILES 26 15</page><page sequence="6">Catrina Beevor &amp; Robert Mull THE LANDSCAPE AT WATER STREET The Landscape has two levels, Street and Canal, each containing within its central zone two primary and three secondary spaces. These are flanked by cellular 'walls' that have distinct and different programmes. The Landscape is designed so that the entire central zone can be used for a single event, for instance a daytime conference or a night? time rave. Its two levels are linked by flights of stairs in the three secondary areas or 'gardens', the last of which can easily be converted to a stage, and the first an area for audience seating. When the Landscape is a venue, reception operates as ticket kiosk and barrier check. Responding to the requirements of the housing association, we have designed the two street-level primary spaces as dining rooms which are designated, respectively, as 'fast' and 'slow'. These can be closed away into the flanking service wall. At canal level we propose a bias towards educational and training uses. Meetings, lectures, classes or performances could be staged in this area, with special recreational or sports events taking place at the week-ends. The television monitors set on pivoting arm and scissor brackets create a link between spaces. Multidirectional, they can exploit the coincidence of national television scheduling and activities supported by the Landscape: breakfast TV, Open University, keep fit ? all may be watched in an appropriate context. On the Snow Hill side at both levels the Wall contains operations which are run or franchised by the managing housing association: the gym, the solarium, the music room and the darkrooms. Here also are the kitchens and the entrances to the three Lodges. On the railway side at both street and canal level the 'wall' is the Wall of Work housing 310 square metres of bare space, plus the housing association shop, reception and office resource area, now framed in a workaday context. We envisage that the Wall of Work will provide lock-up workshop and selling spaces, and that it will extend into an outside market along the wide part of the towpath beneath the railway arch. During a crisis the Wall of Work could provide emergency shelter, or be squatted by temporary users, thereby acting as a barometer or testing-ground for a radically different definition of the role of work. THE LODGE PROTOTYPE Each Lodge is an autonomous group of individuals, a tribe capable of generating its own identity, mythology and values. This is supported and encouraged by the architecture of the Lodge, which draws on the prototype of the family house for its structure and identity. THE WATER STREET LODGES The Foyer residents are housed in three Lodges, each consisting of forty rooms and entered from the Landscape through a 'garden gate' and up a 'garden path' over a 'garden' void. Next there is the front door of the Lodge, with an array of pigeonholes or maiboxes opposite, and the Lodge's own lift to one side. Off the hallway is the Lodge Master's office, each Lodge Master having responsibility for his or her flock of forty, as well as acting in one of the three advisory roles proposed by the housing association. Here the vertical, house? like structure of the lodge takes over. Eight room types are dispersed over five floors. For recreation there is the attic play or television room and the roof terrace with a gantry bridge leading to the residents' allotments or the Lodge market garden. Passage between the Lodges at any level except street level is forbidden, save as a means of escape in case of fire. A visit to another Lodge entails a ritual of invitation and entry via the host's front door. The different Lodges project their identity and ideology through a family of visual icons. Within the Landscape each has beside its garden gate an easily programmed LED moving message display and a blackboard wall and bench. In the upper hallways certain surfaces, for instance the screen wall in front of the stairs, are intended as a medium for group expression. Just as the collective culture of the Lodge represents itself through a family of totemic icons, so can the individual Lodger. Rooms have deep, Soviet-style double-glazed windows which act as a small conservatory in summer and an impromptu fridge in winter. The result is an elevation of personal effects: a patchwork of individual choices and obsessions.

He wants the commune, because without it he could not be an individual; for only within the commune can the 'new life' flower, among humans, not merely within them.' (statement on Chalutzism, 1923) Institution 'They are certainly cheap, but they are too like workhouses for my taste. In some of them there is even a compulsory religious service once or twice a week, which the lodgers must attend or leave the house. The fact is that the Salvation Army are so in the habit of thinking themselves a charitable body that they cannot even run a lodging house without making it stink of charity.' (George Orwell, Down and Out in Paris and London, 1933) Framework 'White men, he began, made the common mistake of assuming that, because the Aboriginals were wanderers, they could have no system of land tenure. This was nonsense. Aboriginals, it was true, could not imagine territory as a block of land hemmed in by frontiers: but rather as an interlocking network of "lines" or "ways through".'

Children played, there were those beaten paths, and it was possible to see the city in the background like an open history book.'

Its Victorian hardness and canyon-like quality invest the place with an ineffable and invaluable 'street cred' that any design must build on and embody. The change in level from Water Street to the canal, the surface of the viaduct ? with or without trains, the panorama of the Birmingham skyline: the Foyer can respond to and reflect these powerful qualities as well as provide an appropriate environment in which to live. It can embody general relationships and meanings as well as enabling particular actions to take place. LANDSCAPE OF THE INTERIOR The Foyer should be considered as a microcosm of the society of which it is a part. While private spaces must be provided and respected, a continuity of communal spaces with the surrounding city can make explicit the lack of boundaries between the Foyer community and the community at large. clockwise from top left: Railway viaduct and rooftop playground; model; ground-floor plan. AA FILES 26 19</page><page sequence="10">Caruso ? St John 5 5 w' iti Ii iiiinil Section through courtyard. COMMUNITY The Foyer must enable a variety of social groupings* from die individual to die entire community, to dwell within its spaces. Special status cannot be afforded to any particular grouping, and there must be a natural continuity between individual and group. This open spatial matrix will be the defining characteristic of the F?yer. THE ROOM The rooms are formed by high-quality in situ concrete walls which are sealed, and could be painted. The bathroom and cupboard are conceived of as large-scale items of furniture which sit within die room, stopping short of die ceiling. The comparative luxury of their plywood surfaces juxtaposed with the simple structure of the room lends a dignity to die every-day. The built-in furniture contains all servicing and provides general lighting for the room. 20 AA FILES 26</page><page sequence="11">PRESENCE The volume of the Foyer rises from the complex topography of its site, to assert an urban presence that is equivalent to the warehouses and remnants of Victorian infrastructure that surround it. PROTOTYPE This design for the first British Foyer accepts the responsibility and setting of standards that are inherent to any project which is conceived of as a model. However, the particular spatial organization, materiality and resolution of structure and services arise from a critical reading of the site. A radical contextualism precludes any proposition which is divorced from place. This design attempts to articulate the underlying spirit of the Foyer movement. If it has a contribution to make to a more general idea of Foyer, it is in proposing a set of social hierarchies and ensuing spatial relationships that are inherent to this exemplary and progressive programme.

The pivotal nature of the triple-height volume provides direction-finding to surrounding spaces such as the television lounge, restaurant, lecture hall, photographic darkroom, music/video room, etc. The open piazza ? the 'espace trouve' ? is a covered space contained by the two wings of accommodation and the existing Snow Hill House facade. The building is a process of discovery through its planes. The recurring theme is of spaces leading to a focal point in all instances. The sleeping quarters are flanked on two sides of a central corridor which also has the role of a living room. The corridors are conceived of as places for meeting and interaction. They also form vertical spatial connections. They are also a central spine on the street side and continue to the corner of the two wings, expressing themselves on the facade facing the railway. It is here that the corridor becomes a glazed walkway giving access to the rooms and kitchens. The kitchens, being always of double height, allow two views ? one to the glass roofed piazza and the other overlooking the railway and out to the horizon. Ascending to the top floors the corridors become less wide as the views are maximized. On the fifth floor the gym, or 'Fitness Box', is exposed to the sun and the limitless sky, capturing the most exciting view of the site. The gym is a bare space, defined by two gable ends and a floor, its facades and roof being glazed to allow penetration of the exterior space to the interior. The rooms on the top two floors benefit from the flexibility of the grid and become vertical double rooms, horizontal double rooms or handicapped units. The kitchens, as always, have a double-height space with a mezzanine sitting or living area.

The analysis of the project may proceed through the following aspects: Context: The alignment of the principal accommodation wing with the street and its continuation along the railway bridge creates a large communal space open to the canal, the third side of which is framed by the existing Snow Hill House. A public passage (between the inclined glass plane of the southwest wing and the railway bridge) links Water Street to the canal. The generous space of the 'piazza' is covered by a glazed roof, thus creating a virtual cubic volume which offers a spatial and social opening towards the canal, the sky and the city. By the subtle manner with which it responds to the issues of programme and context, despite its form, the project expresses a desire to disappear in favour of its functions and location. Autonomy : At the same time, in opposition to its contextual insertion, the ensemble is perceived as an autonomous volume. This is strengthened by the disposition of the spaces which constitute the elements of the programme and the horizontal and vertical layering which structures their location. The composition of the project is both functional and poetic, a duality achieved by the subtie use of light with the interrelationships of the autonomous volumetrics of the programme. 'La spatialite' of the scheme is the result of a fusion whereby a classical modernist rigour is combined with a multidirectionality inspired from post-constructivist movements. Added to this are the transparency of certain planes and volumes plus the presence of a variety of focal spaces at different scales throughout the building. This leads to a strong characteristic of this architecture being the dialectic game of solid and void expressed as the poetics of the in-between. In the articulation of its spaces the project bears a multiplicity of physical and perceptual movements which generate a spatial fluidity to act as counterpoint to a more traditional (centred) stability. To conclude, it appears that the quality of this project, of its architecture, resides in a mature complexity which permits a simple first reading of its forms and programme. A poetic synthesis is thus constructed between contemporary currents of architecture engaging such notions as virtuality, transparency and omnidirectionality with a sense of order and place belonging to both modern and historical classicism. These characteristics, added to the sensitive game of the building with its context, bestow on this 'espace trouv?' a rare force of spontaneity. Jacques Sautereau 26 AA FILES 26</page></plain_text>
