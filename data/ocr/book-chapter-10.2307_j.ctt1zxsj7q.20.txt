<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics Chapter 16 Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of 347. Decadent Aesthetics 1 Chapter 16 One of the more fascinating aspects of Nabokov’s artistic method is the way  he “covers his tracks” when referring to potential intertextual sources or  “influences.” He prefers his readers to believe that each work has emerged  fully formed from the broad forehead (as opposed to dark loins) of his Zeus- like consciousness. Or so the prefaces to his novels, with their disclaimers  as to matters of genealogy and their repeated references to the “Viennese  delegation,” would have us think. It is not that Nabokov hesitates to en- gage in intertextual punning or name-dropping, which practice clearly  enriches the links within his own works to the classics of world literature  and culture  — to those names, titles, characters, lines of verse, emplotted  situations, titbits of literary (and nonliterary) history, and so on, whose  subtle interweaving makes Nabokov, like Joyce, one of the central figures  in twentieth-century high modernism. However, to judge by the master’s  obiter dicta, this intertextual play is not meant in any serious way to  undermine the originality of a novel’s or story’s central idea. Cincinnatus C.  is not, despite the many intriguing parallels, an intertextual brother to  Joseph K., since at the time (1934) he wrote Invitation to a Beheading  (Priglashenie na kazn’, Nabokov-Sirin supposedly “had no German, was  completely ignorant of modern German literature, and had not yet read  any French or English translations of Kafka’s works.”2 My own point in these  preliminaries is not to gainsay Nabokov, as he may be telling the truth,3 but  rather to underscore his expressed need to distance himself from Kafka and  to assert his own independence (the one influence he will admit being of  course “the melancholy, extravagant, wise, witty, magical, and altogether  delightful Pierre Delalande, whom I [Nabokov-Sirin] invented”).4 In this  respect, Nabokov beats his beˆte noire, the Freudians, to the punch: even as  he “protests too much” about how critics have hurled the “harmless missiles”  of “Gogol, Tolstoevski, Joyce, Voltaire, Sade, Stendhal, Balzac, Byron ... [the  list goes on to include other greats as well as fictional authors]”5 in his  direction as sources for his style and ideas, he wins.

In chess  parlance, this comes under the classification of anticipating the next move. The purpose of the present essay is to retrace Nabokov’s steps, and uncover  348. his intertextual tracks, in the very “American” Lolita, by returning to one of  PART III the central texts of Russian Symbolism, Fyodor Sologub’s The Petty Demon  (Melkii bes, 1907).6 My argument will be that, rather than looking at the more  obvious intertextual clues in Lolita, such as those involving Poe, Me ́rime ́e,  Shakespeare, Joyce, Cervantes, or Hugo,7 which point to Western sources and  are more easily recoverable by the author’s primary (anglophone) audience,  the genuine or deeper structural sibling in this case comes from a source  closer to home  — the fin de sie`cle Russian Symbolist/Decadent movement  that Nabokov experienced at a still impressionable age and that, to a degree  he often hinted at but was not willing to admit outright, was powerfully  formative.8 Of Blok, for example, undoubtedly a stronger influence on him in  his early years than Sologub, Nabokov wrote Edmund Wilson in 1943, “I am  glad you are studying Blok  — but be careful: he is one of those poets that  gets into one’s system  — and everything else seems unblokish and flat. I, as  most Russians, went through that stage some twenty-five years ago.”9 What  I will be suggesting is that in Lolita Nabokov is not merely invoking Sologub  in a mockingbird game of “trivial pursuit,” but actually engaging The Petty  Demon at a deeper striation, with the result that the central concerns of  Sologub’s novel are precisely those of Nabokov’s, but in reverse.10 At issue  here then is not intertextuality at a “micro” but at a “macro” level. Nabokov,  as I will try to demonstrate, is returning to some of the key aesthetic and  6 Melkii bes was written for example  — seem freighted with interview, Nabokov says that  1892–1902, excerpted serially greater meaning and “emplotted- he had digested ‘the entire  in Voprosy zhizni, and published ness” than others) does appear to population’ of the ‘so-called’  separately in 1907.

Is the  Beautiful Lady (of Solovyov, Blok, and Bely fame) an angelic or demonic (or  daemonic  — Nabokov plays with the different spellings) presence in the life  of the beholder? Is the world (and word) structure that filters everything we 349. see and do really Manichean or still perhaps Judaeo-Christian? In the pursuit Chapter 16 of beauty, at which point does one’s aesthetic seeing and feeling (the lovely  patterns on a butterfly’s wing, the way the human body moves gracefully in a  young person) intersect and implicate one’s ethical seeing and feeling? What  are the rules of zhiznetvorchestvo, that very Symbolist game of “life creation”  that incorporates others, often unbeknownst to them, in making myth (or  mythos, literary plot) out of one’s personal life? But then, having returned  to these formative issues, Nabokov again brilliantly covers his tracks, by  projecting them onto an American literary-cultural chronotope that has no  memory of The Petty Demon (Sologub does not seem to be directly cited in  the text of Lolita) or of a young Russian’s first encounter with it. Sologub’s The Petty Demon was clearly a book the young Nabokov read and pon- dered. According to Andrew Field, it was one of the period volumes in Nabokov  pe`re’s library.11 More to the point, as one of the most celebrated (and notori- ous) of Symbolist texts, it was, along with Blok’s lyrics and Bely’s Petersburg,  bound to strike a resonant chord in the adolescent Nabokov. Intriguingly, we  have virtually no references by Nabokov himself to Sologub or his novel in his  surviving correspondence.12 Moreover, one of the very few times Nabokov said  anything about Sologub in print was a characteristically dismissive judgment  that, if taken at face value, could only suggest that the decadent author would  of course) in the creation of episode of the seduction of the of this reader’s knowledge, been  the diabolical double Quilty. handsome young schoolboy Sasha studied in a systematic way.

First, the literal level of meaning in Sologub’s text. The Petty Demon is the story Chapter 16 of an evil presence (hence the title) in a provincial Russian town at the turn of  the century. One of the central ironies of the novel and one Sologub cultivated  in his various prefaces is to whom or what exactly the title refers: Is it the  protagonist, Peredonov, who gradually goes out of his mind, commits murder,  and himself appears as the incarnation of petty evil (and who was thought  by some critics to be an autobiographical portrait of the sadistic teacher  Teternikov)? Is it the subplot revolving around Alexander (Sasha) Pylnikov,  whose appearance in town seems somehow to incite Peredonov’s mad acts  (note how the nedotykomka begins to appear to Peredonov shortly after the  latter first sees Pylnikov in church and, curiously, whenever the nedotykomka  is on stage Pylnikov is absent, and vice-versa19) and whose tutelage in amoral  paganism and eroticism at the knee (literally) of the Rutilova sister Liudmila  can be viewed in terms of traditional Christian teaching as itself “demonic”?  Is it the atmosphere of the entire town, which seems “possessed” by poshlost’  (vulgarity, pettiness), which produces victims (Peredonov in the first instance)  that are symptomatic of the problem without necessarily being the source  of it, and which is embodied in the gray, indeterminate, yet forever moving  and tormenting nedotykomka? Or is it, finally, in a Gogolian reading Sologub  encouraged, the “petty demon” that resides in Russia as a whole and that, to  borrow Baudelaire’s line, is the still larger implicit target: “Hypocrite lecteur,  —  mon semblable, — mon fre`re”?20 Thus, the ontological nature of evil is a, perhaps the, crucial starting point in So- logub’s novel.21 It is so because all actions and reactions by the narrator and  characters, all perceptions and conclusions as to why the world is the way  it is, are filtered through that starting point. (By the same token, it is this  18 See Nabokov, Sobranie the depiction in front of them poverty and humiliation firsthand,  sochinenii 3:415/759, 431/762, is reliable, precise, gloomy, evil.

What this means on a metaphysical level  is that Sologub’s universe is, a priori, Manichean and false, created not by a  benevolent God but by a Gnostic demiurge.22 Likewise, as Tomas Venclova has  352. elegantly argued, it is ruled by demony pyli (demons of dust), these carriers of  PART III spiritual entropy first introduced by Briusov in his 1899 poem by that name  (Sologub was present among the audience in St. Petersburg when Briusov first  read the verses in public) and then developed conceptually by Merezhkovsky,  who saw in this foregrounding of the diabolical as lukewarm and petty an  obvious continuation of Gogol (Gogol’ i chert [1906]), and Vyacheslav Ivanov,  who personified this disintegration of spiritual light/energy as the deity  Ariman (as opposed to Lucifer, the grand demonic personality) (Rodnoe i  vselenskoe [1917]).23 In Venclova’s words, “the correlation of demonism with  formlessness, feebleness, disintegration and, concretely, with dust became  an important myth-generating model of Russian Symbolist literature.”24  And it is this conjoining of the image of dust with the notion of the demonic  that powerfully informs all aspects of Sologub’s contemporaneous novel,  from issues of characterization to issues of plot, language, and symbolic  patterning. Just as the town is constantly described in terms of dirt and  dust  — “Again the weather was overcast. The wind blew in gusts and bore  funnels of dust [pyl’nye vikhri] along the streets. Everything was illuminated  by a sad, almost un-sun-like light cast through the cloudy mist”  — so too are  its inhabitants Grushina’s skin is said to be “all covered with wrinkles that  were fine and as if filled with dust [zapylennye].”25 Even the nedotykomka  seems to appear, and, paradoxically, draw its haunting strength from, the  debilitating presence of dust, disorder, indeterminacy, shape-shifting: The nedotykomka ran under the chairs and into the corners  and began to let out a shriek. It was dirty, evil-smelling, dis- gusting, terrifying. It was by now clear that it was inimical to  Peredonov and that it had turned up precisely on his account,  and that previously it had not existed at any time or in any  place. ... Here it is alive, sent to terrorize and destroy Peredonov,  magical, of differing shapes; it follows after Peredonov, tricks him,  laughs at him, now rolling on the floor, now pretending to be a  rag, a piece of ribbon, a branch, a flag, a cloud, a dog, a column  of dust on the street (stolbom pyli), and all the while crawling  and running after Peredonov, exhausting him, wearing him out  with its shimmering dance.26 22 For a Gnostic reading of article first appeared in Scando- 25 Sologub, Melkii bes, 88,  Melkii bes see Irene Masing-Delic, Slavica 24 (1978): 107–24. 41.

Indeed, in Sologub’s pessimistic worldview,  the secret is the dust. There is no transcendence. Princess Volchanskaya  is a Beautiful Lady who will never come. Varvara, whose debauched head 353. belongs to Aldonsa and whose weirdly beautiful (bewitched?) torso belongs Chapter 16 to Dulcinea (“the body of a tender nymph”28), is the bride as both cousin  (the taboo of incest) and slut. “And this is how it often happens, for in truth  it is the lot of beauty in our time to be trampled and cursed.”29 Into this fallen world comes Sasha Pylnikov. He is a beautiful child with epicene  features,30 a veritable young Dionysus, while the dancing, drinking Rutilova  sisters are his maenads. Physically, he is distinguished by luxuriant hair  (especially his dark eyelashes), a trademark of Dionysus. And from the very  beginning he is associated with ecstatic religion and ritual: Peredonov moved forward, toward the middle rows [of the  church]. There, at the very end of the row, to the right, stood  Sasha Pylnikov. He was praying in a modest fashion and often  getting down on his knees. Peredonov looked at him: it was par- ticularly pleasant to see Sasha on his knees, as though som e-  one being punished, looking forward at the radiant altar doors,  with a concerned and beseeching expression on his face, with  entreaty and sadness in his black eyes, shaded as they were by  long, blue-black eyelashes. He was dark-complected, gracefully  slender [stroinyi]  — a fact especially obvious when he sat, calm  and erect, on his knees, as if under somebody’s sternly observ- ant glance  — and with a high and broad chest. He seeme d to  Peredonov the very image of a maiden.31 Note here, before any of the action surrounding the Sasha-Liudmila subplot  gets underway, the chasteness of Sasha’s young body coupled with the  sincerity/purity of his inner world, his soul. It is this “intact” quality, seen  against the backdrop of its potential sadistic defilement (Sasha on his knees,  his modesty, his position as one being punished, and the like), that attracts  the demonic Peredonov to him. Other motifs that point unmistakably to the  myth of Dionysus are: women helpers as snake handlers (Liudmila’s dream)  and flower bearers (the scents from Liudmila’s perfumes); the reversal of  social roles during Dionysian festivals, including cross-dressing by boys and  men (Liudmila’s clothing of Sasha in female attire); and the appearance of  the young Dionysus as beardless (Liudmila praises Sasha’s lack of usiki and  “Khot’ by kto-nibud’ izbavil, slovom 27 Andrew Field, “Preface,” describes him as a “disguised  kakim ili udarom naotmash’”) with in Sologub, Petty Demon, trans. maiden” (pereodetaia baryshnia).

While the myth of Dionysus is central to the “pagan” subplot in The Petty Demon,  PART III just as the myth of the nymph (or “nymphet”) will be significant to the  nontranscendent world of Humbert Humbert, I would like to pause here for  a moment to focus on the function of the aesthetic realm in Sologub (and,  by implication, Nabokov). As stated, there is no escape from the poshlyi  (vulgar, petty) world of Sologub’s demiurge. However, through their erotic  play, which is essentially foreplay, Sasha and Liudmila come as close as is  humanly possible to exiting this prison. Following the Symbolist notion of  the sexual/procreative act itself as degradation and animality (Solovyov, the  Mer ezhkovskys, Blok and Bely, and so on), Sologub raises the art of making  love without performing intercourse to a new level. (Again, to leap ahead of  ourselves a little, it is precisely this line that Humbert crosses and ethically  criminalizes in his “solipsizing” of Lolita.) For example, Liudmila is interested  in Sasha first and foremost because he is not mature: “The best age for boys,” said Liudmila, “is fourteen-fifteen  years old. He [Sasha] still can’t do anything and doesn’t un- derstand fully, but he already has a presentiment of everything,  absolutely everything. And he doesn’t have a disgusting beard. ... “You [Liudmila’s sisters] don’t understand a thing. I don’t  love him at all in the way you think. To love a boy is better than  falling in love with a vulgar mug with a moustache. I love him in  an innocent way. I don’t need anything from him.”33 It is precisely this notion of “staged” eroticism  — the combination of physical  youth and beauty, bright colors, exotic smells, limited caressing or touching,  the ritualized exchange of pleasure and pain (the sadomasochistic theme),  the playing at sacred boundaries/taboos (child abuse, the undercurrent of  incest), and so on  — without “penetration” or mature heterosexual relations  that is Humbert Humbert’s dream, only with the roles reversed. “I am not  concerned with so-called ‘sex’ at all,” says Humbert. “Anybody can imagine  those elements of animality.

Between the age  limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain 355. bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their Chapter 16 true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac);  and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as “nymphets.”  ... You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite  melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super- voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how  you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable  signs  — the slightly feline outline of the cheekbone, the slenderness  of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and  tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate  — the little deadly demon  among the wholesome children; she stands unrecognized by them  and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.35 Perhaps the key to the attraction that the younger partner holds for the older one  in both relationships, other than the fact that the bashful epicene and the  nymph-like tomboy36 are as physically lovely as they are sexually ambivalent,  is that they are unaware of their beauty or “daemonic” (projecting an inner  spirit) status. Stated simply, they are viewed as blank pages to be written  on, which inevitably raises the issue of art and the role of the older partner  as artist or shaper of this virgin material. Thus, the emphasis on punning  and proto-poetry that goes with the seduction scenes in both novels is  part and parcel of this foreplay, the sense that these neophytes are being  introduced into a kind of game that is verbal and erotic at the same time  and that does not necessarily lead anywhere, except back to itself (the  aesthetic principle): Liudmila asking Sasha “Kto zhelaet?” (Who wishes/  desires?) but then teasing him with the same phrase parsed differently  “Kto zhe laet?” (Who is that barking?), or even better her double entendre  on rozochki (meaning either “roses” or “birch rods”  — that is, the source of  pleasure or pain); Humbert singing along with Lolita the “Carmen/barmen”  ditty (presumably Lolita does not know who the original Carmen is) at the  moment that her legs are extended across his lap.37 35 Ibid., 18–19. 37 Sologub, Melkii bes, Tishkov (Sologub, Melkii bes, 87).  36 Just as Sasha’s sexual 157; Nabokov, Annotated Lolita, Intriguingly, the reference to  identity is made deliberately 60–64.

The notion of lap (lono in Russian, but also na  koleniakh, as in sitting “on [someone’s] knees”) is suggestive in both  cultural contexts, as Nabokov (if not Sologub) was well aware. It evokes  356. connotations of nurture and comfort, as of a mother holding a smaller child  PART III “on her lap” or “at her breast” (lono can mean figuratively both “lap” and  “bosom”), but it also can become eroticized, particularly when the place  being offered is male and close to the genitals (as in Humbert’s case).38 The  figure doing the sitting is symbolically in a more vulnerable or submissive  position (note the link here between Sasha in church “on his knees, as  though someone being punished,” and his repeated pose later in the text on  Liudmila’s knees). The fact that we see the child shift its status before our  eyes from someone traditionally protected to someone explicitly eroticized  and fetishized, while sitting on a “protector’s” knees, is precisely what  has made the two stories so controversial. So-called moral outrage (again,  something Sologub rightly or wrongly seems not at all concerned about)  meets aesthetic titillation in an exceptionally potent brew. Furthermore, it  is during these lap scenes qua pseudo-epiphanic moments that the adult  characters declare (Liudmila openly to Sasha, Humbert significantly only to  himself) their fervent faith in their pagan religions: Liudmila tells Sasha she  is a iazychnitsa (pagan) and he is her otrok-bogoravnyi (god-like youth);  Humbert exclaims, as he sur reptitiously masturbates against the pressure  of Dolly’s body, that Lolita has been “safely solipsized.”39 And it is during  these very lap scenes, I would argue, that the notion of crime, which is  absent in Sologub’s text, enters the picture in Nabokov’s, exposing what  could be called, at least for the younger writer who had lived through the  excesses of Symbolist myth-making, the limits of decadent aesthetics. Looking more closely, what exactly is at stake in these parallel lap scenes and  what are the significant affinities, and inversions, shaping them? First of  all, with regard to Sologub, a strong argument can be made for the total  absence of an ethical realm. Gorky understood this implicitly and this is  what so incensed him about the unregenerate “decadent.”40 What I mean by  absence of ethics is that no one is immune to the “demonic” in Sologub’s  world  — there is no one who is ethically above the fray. Liudmila and Sasha  are, for the time they have together (and clearly Liudmila understands that  these days are numbered), god-like aesthetically, that is, Sasha is the otrok- bog and Liudmila his guide and worshiper, but not ethically. Their virtue has  nothing to do with kindness or goodness or self-abnegation, but with beauty  38 In the Russian version 39 Sologub, Melkii bes,  of the novel Nabokov repeatedly 238–39; Nabokov, Annotated  uses the term lono to describe Lolita, 62. Dolly’s “seat” on Humbert that 40 See discussion in  Sunday morning. See Vladimir S.D. Cioran, “Introduction,” in  Nabokov, Lolita (Russian ver - Petty Demon, ed. Barker, 17–18. sion), 48. </page> <page sequence="11"> Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics and form and self-affirmation. Likewise, Peredonov and all the denizens of  his lower world are “evil” not because they hurt or torment others (which  they do), but because they defile and disfigure  — that is, they contribute to  the absence of beauty and form. Hence the ethical is simply not a category  that is engaged in The Petty Demon. Moreover, this a priori understanding 357. affects the intimate scenes involving Sasha and Liudmila in intriguing ways, Chapter 16 particularly when certain details are juxtaposed with Nabokov’s presentation. For example, the closest we come to force or coercion in Sasha and Liudmila’s  erotic foreplay is the time Liudmila wants her young god to disrobe to the waist: [Liudmila] drew Sasha to herself and began to unbutton his  shirt. Sasha tried to fight her off, grabbing hold of her hands. His  face took on a frightened look and shame akin to fear overcame  him. And because of this it seemed as though he momentarily lost  his strength. Liudmila knitted her brows and with determination  began to undress him. She took off his belt, then somehow pulled off  his smock [bluza]. Sasha fought her off more and more desperately.  They struggled, circling around the bedroom and bumping into  tables and chairs. An intoxicating sweet smell came from Liudmila  and went to Sasha’s head and overpowered him. With a swift shove in the chest Liudmila toppled Sasha onto the  sofa. A button popped off the shirt at which she had been tugging.  Liudmila quickly exposed Sasha’s shoulder and then began to pull  his arm out of this sleeve. Fighting back Sasha struck Liudmila  by mistake on her cheek with the palm of his hand. Of course he  hadn’t wanted to hit her, but the blow, which landed on her cheek  with all his strength, was powerful and loud. Liudmila shuddered,  wobbled a bit, turned blood red, but did not release Sasha. “You wicked boy, fighting [like this],” she screamed with a choking  voice. Sa sha was terribly embarrassed, dropped his hands, and guilti- ly looked at the whitish stripes, the traces of his fingers, imprinted on  Liudmila’s left cheek. Liudmila took advantage of his confusion. She rap- idly pulled his shirt off his shoulders down to his elbows. Sasha came to  his senses, tried to pull away from her, but it turned out even worse for  him  — Liudmila nimbly jerked the sleeves from his arms, and the shirt  fell down to his waist. Sasha felt the cold and a new rush of shame, clear  and merciless, which caused his head to spin. Now Sasha was exposed  to his waist. Liudmila held him firmly by the hand, and with a trem- bling hand slapped him several times on his naked back, then looked </page> <page sequence="12"> RussianR Leiatdeirnagtu Rreu:s Bsiacnk gWrroituenrds,  RFeoaredginrogu Tnhde,m selves and Others Reading Russian Writers Reading  Creative Cognition Themselves and Others into his lowered and, beneath the blue-black eyelashes, strangely  twinkl ing eyes.41 This is really the climax of the Sasha-Liudmila relationship. Though they both  break down in tears due to their respective struggles  — Sasha from shame  358. and Liudmila from her young god’s momentary recalcitrance  — within a few  PART III paragraphs Sasha begins to understand the depth of Liudmila’s feelings  and Liudmila confides to him her pagan profession de foi. The experience  is not presented in any way as a “deflowering” of Sasha by the older  aggressor; if anything, it brings them both closer to an impossible, because  finally unfulfillable, desire. There is no room, no space, for the relationship  to develop beyond this status of the young Dionysus naked to the waist in  the presence of his adoring female worshiper/bacchante: “Liudmila hastily  kissed Sasha’s arms from his shoulders to his fingers, and Sasha didn’t pull  them away, now aroused, now plunged as he was in passionate and cruel  dreams. Liudmila’s kisses were warmed with adoration, and now it was as  if not a boy, but a youthful god was being kissed in secret and trembling  worship of flowering flesh.”42 By the same token, there will be no rape, no  penetration, for that is not what Liudmila wants (she cannot in any event  “enter” him) or what (though he has intimations) Sasha is capable of. Thus, as the inner logic of these scenes seems to dictate, the pyl’ that is  in Sasha’s name (Pylnikov) and is in the pollen-sprinkled (pollen being  flowers’ “dust”—“tsvetochnaia pyl’”) aromas that refine and aestheticize  their trysts (Liudmila uses a “raspylitel’” or atomizer to spray her scents)  is the positive flip-side of Peredonov’s negative “dirty” and “dusty” (pyl’nyi)  world. Based on these semantic ties, some scholars have argued that  Sasha and Liudmila’s world is essentially no different from Peredonov’s  —  that is, it too is demonic, fallen, a kind of alluring mirror inversion of the  nedotykomka’s realm, with which it alternates.43 It is also true that Sasha  begins to experience demonic tendencies because of what Liudmila has  awakened in him: when his aunt comes home to his “mad” cavorting about  the house (while thinking about Liudmila and “what she wants” he is  overcome by “wild gaiety”) she accuses him of “acting possessed [by the  devil]” (“besnovat’sia”) and “going mad” (“besit’sia”).44 Be this as it may,  Sasha and Liudmila are extremely ambiguo us, yet for the most part positive,  figures in the novel: they are the closest of all the characters to gods (pagan  ones) and the divine; they turn their dust (pyl’) into beauty (flowers); they  are trapped in the demiurge’s prison but they try for something better;  they learn a pleasure laced with pain that is not degrading but refining; and  41 Sologub, Melkii bes, 237. 45 “I am unable to  42 Ibid., 239 foresee and to fend inevitable  43 See, for example, Ven- attempts to find in the alembics  clova, “K demonologii,” 150–55. of Despair something of the  44 Sologub, Melkii bes, 240. rhetorical venom that I injected  in a much later novel. Hermann  and Humbert are alike only in the  </page> <page sequence="13"> Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics they embody an aesthetic principle that is as far as possible from social  amelioration and Christian conscience (the ethical principle). Similarly, it is  this version of total aestheticism in the absence of an identifiable morality  that Nabokov confronts in his “lap scene” and its aftermath in Lolita. If one could identify the central difference in how Sologub and Nabokov treat the 359. erotic foreplay-cum-aestheticization of reality in their novels it would be this: Chapter 16 what happens to Sasha at the hands of Liudmila is, all things considered, a  positive “awakening.” Whether Sasha cannot physically be “abused” by this  older (though still young) woman, or whether the lessons that he learns from  her are the best his fallen world can yield up, it is clear that their playing  at the religion of Dionysus is not a conventional morality tale. If Sasha  obeyed his inhibitions, succeeded in fending off Liudmila’s overtures, and  simply went back to being a chaste and dutiful youth, there is absolutely  no indication in the text that this outcome would produce either a happier  or psychically more fulfilled young protagonist. Quite the opposite. In their  coming close to, or perhaps even achieving, the truth of pagan worship  —  the glimpsing of a god in the flesh  — there is no identifiable irony. For the  moment he has with Liudmila, before he becomes a hirsute, pomaded, and  dumbly “penetrating” samets (male adult of the species), Sasha could be  Dionysus. That seems to be Sologub’s point. Not that he will not inevitably  become another feckless prisoner in Peredonov’s world (the Manichean  theme), but that for this brief interlude he and Liudmila, celebrating the  beauty of their bodies without having sex, can taste something “other.” With Nabokov the issue of what Humbert does to Dolly Haze is much less  ambiguous, the morality of his actions much clearer. First and foremost, by  reversing the sex roles and making Humbert considerably older than Liudmila,  Nabokov brings the theme of what today is termed “child abuse” much closer  to the surface. Humbert knows he is a criminal and realizes the depths of his  degradation (which makes him superior to Hermann in Despair45), yet the fact  that he supposedly “cannot help himself” does not mitigate the crime in his  ethically staunch creator’s eyes. For what is not consummated in Sologub’s  world is in Nabokov’s: first Humbert masturbates (presented with elaborate  verbal pyrotechnics and circumlocution  — a parody of aesthetic foreplay46) as  he “safely solipsizes” his prey on the sofa, then he eventually has sex with  Lolita after her mother has died and he has “captured” her for the night (to  be repeated again and again elsewhere) at the Enchanted Hunters hotel.  The point is that by displacing the real Dolly to a safe solipsistic remove and  making her permanently into Lolita Humbert has affirmed the girl’s semi- sense that two dragons painted a year; but Hell shall never parole I am about to replay; I want them  by the same artist at different Hermann” (Vladimir Nabokov, to examine its every detail and  periods of his life resemble “Foreword,” Despair [New York, see for themselves how careful,  each other.

In effect, Nabokov takes Sologub and moralizes him by showing the  360. inherent dangers in using other human beings as material to realize one’s  PART III private dreams (the zhiznetvorchestvo theme), whether “wet” or innocent,  no matter how refined or verbally dressed out. Nabokov also builds off the  dangerous inwardness of the situation by linking it directly to masturbation  (solipsistic behavior = playing with oneself) and then, eventually, to actual  sex, penetration, which Lo lita complains of as hurting her (first physically  but then, and more per vasively, emotionally, psychologically): It was something quite special, that feeling: an oppressive,  hideous constraint as if I were sitting with the small ghost of  somebody I had just killed. As she was in the act of getting back into the car, an ex- pres sion of pain fiitted across Lo’s face. It fiitted again, more  meaningfully, as she settled down beside me. No doubt, she  reproduced it that second time for my benefit. Foolishly, I asked  her what was the matter. “Nothing, you brute,” she replied. “You  what?” I asked. She was silent. Leaving Briceland. Loquacious Lo  was silent. Cold spiders of panic crawled down my neck. This was  an orphan. This was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a  heavy-limbed, foul-smelling adult had had strenuous intercourse  three times that very morning. Whether or not the realization of  a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation, it had, in a sense,  overshot its mark   — and plunged into a nightmare. ... “You chump,” she said, sweetly smiling at me. “You revolting  creature. I was a daisy-fresh girl, and look what you’ve done to  me. I ought to call the police and tell them you raped me. Oh, you  dirty, dirty old man.” Was she just joking? An ominous hysterical note rang through  her silly words. Presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips,  she started complaining of pains, said she could not sit, said I  had torn something inside her. ... She appeared at last [from the filling-station restroom]. “Look,”  she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so, “give me some  dimes and nickels. I want to call mother in that hospital. What’s  the number?” </page> <page sequence="15"> Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics “Get in,” I said. “You can’t call that number.” “Why?” “Get in and slam the door.” She got in and slammed the door. The old garage man  beamed at her. I swung onto the highway. 361. “Why can’t I call my mother if I want to?” Chapter 16 “Because,” I answered, “your mother is dead.”47 The irony everywhere present in Nabokov is totally absent in Sologub (at least  with regard to the Liudmila-Sasha episodes). This irony is felt because there is  obviously a dissonance between the point of view of Humbert and that of the  implied author. Earlier, during the Sunday sofa scene, Humbert’s behavior had  been precisely not “chaste” (despite his disclaimers); indeed, such phrases  as “learned readers” lend themselves to the somewhat buffoonish, tongue- in-cheek tone, as if at some level Humbert does not believe himself (which  is probably true). Now again, at this crucial juncture in the text (intercourse  has finally been accomplished, Part Two is about to begin), Humbert’s words  constantly comment ironically on themselves. His jocose melodrama and  overstatement (“small ghost,” “Loquacious Lo,” “cold spiders,” “absolute waif,”  “heavy-limbed, foul-smelling adult,” and so on), which might seem in other  circumstances to take the edge off the seriousness of the moment, here only  cause us to see through their smokescreen to the real pain being glossed  underneath. On the very day that Humbert realizes his obsession by crossing  the final boundary, “[tearing] something inside her” through his brute act of  penetration, he informs her of the actual condition of her orphanhood, and in so  doing tears something else inside her. He has, in a cruelly literalized metaphor,  “overshot [his] mark.” What is more, Lolita now has “absolutely nowhere else  to go” except back into the clutches of her captor, the “pentapod monster.”48 In conclusion, we might say that the pyl’ that is the dust and dirt of Peredonov’s  realm but also the pollen and flowering scents of Liudmila’s and Pylnikov’s  has become the “haze” (the unfortunate Dolly’s and Charlotte’s surname)  of Humbert’s enchanted, but deeply immoral (not amoral) story. Indeed, if  Sasha’s counterpart in Lolita is the young heroine, then Humbert’s partner   in Sologub is not so much Liudmila as Peredonov himself  — a more refined  and cultured and, yes, occasionally sympathetic Peredonov, but still one  trapped in his own obsessions and blindly buffeted about by his lower urges.  The grotesque and ontologically tautological “Double Don” (Pe ́redo ́nov)  has become the innerly beastly and identically two-beat, tetrasyllabic  “Humbert Son of Humbert” (Hu ́mbert Hu ́mbert).49 Likewise, Symbolism/ 47 Ibid., 142–43.

The hazy, pseudo- exculpatory logic (after all, the miscreant does deserve one evening a year  in the alleyways of Paradise) and alluring language (comic and lyric by turns)  362. of Humbert’s cautionary tale ostensibly belong to the madman in his cell.  PART III But the sure sense we readers get that this tale is cautionary and that the  place Humbert’s hypertrophied longings must go is, despite the aesthetic  foreplay, where they must always go in such cases belongs to the enveloping  sanity of Humbert’s creator. More to the point, the very vulgarity, poshlost’, that lies at the heart of  Humbert’s lifelong project  — for what is poshlost’ in Nabokov’s mind if  not the penchant for dragging others into one’s indecent and all-too- predictable dreams?  — is the same profound lack of originality that confuses  the hero with the author50 (also Sologub’s problem) and condemns the text  as pornographic when what it is is a masterfully executed send-up of the  expectations that go with literary titillation. This, the poshlost’ embedded  in much symbolist zhiznetvorchestvo, is what Nabokov took from Sologub,  the exquisite aesthete, and turned on its head. And the symbolist magic  moment, the coming of a Beautiful Lady or Sophia (an eroticized Holy  Wisdom) to a uniquely privileged mortal? It is nothing more and nothing less  than a coming of the most basic biological sort. Thus, if in The Petty Demon  the one bright spot is the young Dionysus and his bacchante before they  become the same defiled lovers as Peredonov and Varvara, then in Lolita  the picture of the young nymph, no matter how mesmerizing to the hunter,  simply cannot exist in the reader’s eye without the countervailing image of  the “hugely pregnant” and soon-to-die Mrs. Richard F. Schiller. The phrase  “Lolita had been safely solipsized,” surely the most pregnant in the novel,  was rendered tellingly by Nabokov himself in the 1967 Russian version  as “Real’nost’ Lolity byla blagopoluchno otmenena”51  (Lolita’s reality had  been safely cancelled out). It is this cancelling out that lies behind all the  intertextual gamesmanship and gives to the work what could otherwise be  mistaken for mockingbird lightness and brightness a true humanity and  moral gravitas.  50 See, for example, with the author in their moral 51 Nabokov, Lolita, 49.
