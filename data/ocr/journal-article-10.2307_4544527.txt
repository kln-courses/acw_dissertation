MACKINNON. PROFESSOR WISDOM has often remarked that contemporary philosophical discussions are only superficially different from those which we now call classical; that although we may often concern ourselves with the way words or sentences work, what we are really discussing are the old riddles of materialism versus idealism and the rest. The methods have greatly changed ; but the questions are the same even though the new methods help us sometimes to throw light on the peculiar nature of the problems which beset us. The phrase " metaphysical language " shows that in this paper there is an acceptance in principle of the new way of proceeding. But the problem which the phrase suggests is an old one, older even than Kant, who left us with one discussion of the issue which can properly be called classical the discriminating reader can find the issue canvassed in the great schoolmen and their successors, and may even be led to seek its statement in Aristotle, if he has not himself already found it in Plato. If at the outset I speak of Kant, it is not because he is the earliest in time to raise these issues; it is rather because I find in his statement of them something which I would wish to call to notice before advancing further. I do this because in some of Kant's language, treated by the metaphysically curious rather than by the Kantian scholar there is much which may help to a proper definition of the problem of metaphysical language. Kant's doctrine, of course, is in many respects vieux jeu yet for all that he maintains a certain hold upon his readers, in as much as he raised problems that are with us to this present. He stated them in terms of a logical doctrine that 0</page><page sequence="2">116 D. M. MACKINNON. few if any accept, and yet he brought out in an unforgettable way what I would call the metaphysical crux. Professor Wisdom has said that in the philosopher the logician melts into the poet ; and although at first sight nothing less poetic than Kant's style can easily be imagined, it may be reward- ing to seek hints of vision of men's situation revealed by the *severity of his architectonic. We all know how many teachers of philosophy in expounding Kant have had occasion to speak of his judgement that it is futile for us to use " the concepts of the understanding " to scale the heights of the unconditioned. If we are self-conscious about this language, what do we notice ? Are we not attributing to Kant a model of the human intellectual situation of a rather peculiar sort ? We speak of concepts ; we are of course thinking of Kant's doctrine of categories, perhaps recalling his suggestion that when we try to attain know- ledge of the unconditioned, what we are doing is to abuse elements of our intellectual endowment. The impulse to use such language in clarifying the obscurities of Kant's meaning is almost irresistible ; and perhaps if we make our own what our effort of clarification implies, we find it suggests the model of a man who has tools for one job but who somehow finds himself compelled to use those tools for a job which they simply will not do. If the impulse is inevitable, the failure is equally so. For Kant we can, in virtue of the spontaneous activity of our understanding, make the world of sense intelligible ; but if we try to use (note the inevitability of that verb) the concepts of that under- standing to reveal to us the reasons why there should be a world for us to understand, we abuse (again note the verb) the very character of those concepts themselves. All this is familiar ; but what I want to do is to deepen our self-consciousness about the Kantian model. Although Kant cannot be called a pragmatist, those who try to expound him find themselves speaking of concepts as tools, which will do one job and not another. Going further, the vision with which at least part of Kant's first Critique leaves us is of a man desperately trying to scale mountains</page><page sequence="3">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 117 with ropes which will only serve on the foothills. For when he is on the foothills, the Kantian man is dealing only with what is conditioned ; but it is the summits, the uncon- ditioned with which he is most deeply concerned. (" Most deeply?" there again language moves to the metaphorical. Perhaps others who re-read Kant in the light of Wisdom do not have this experience in respect of his doctrine. Yet increasingly it would seem one of the things which gives Kant a permanent hold on his readers is his insight into the persistence of the metaphysical pursuit and some of the obstacles that stand in the way of the completion of the chase. Obstacles ; chase. The metaphor is as plain there as when I spoke before of the scaling of mountains and the rest. Perhaps in the end the attempt to describe the impossibility of metaphysics must always involve the use of metaphor; it is not only the metaphysician who bends language to new uses, but the meta-metaphysician also. The latter sees the folly of the metaphysician's - project, and he makes the definition of that folly a matter of logic. We cannot use the concepts of the understanding to scale the heights of the unconditioned, to see ourselves as we really are sub specie dternitatis. Whatever sort of " cannot " that may be, it remains a statement of the essence of Kant's critique. But what is sometimes ignored is that the sort of meta- metaphysics which Kant offers is itself a metaphysics. You may call it a psycho-metaphysics, as Professor Ryle did ; but it has the curious poetic character of metaphysics all the same.' If you try to guess its inwardness, you have to forego your critical knowledge of his architectonic and try to see him as the scholastics who criticised him, saw him. They saw that he raised a problem which by the dexterous use of Aristotelian analogy they had tried to by-pass. Being, they claimed, was an analogically participated transcenden- 1 I am quite awart that in the above I have not paid the proper attention to Kant's view of the regulative use of the Ideas. o 2</page><page sequence="4">118 D. M. MACKINNON. tal. And therefore when one had set one's concept full- square on the scale of being, if one did not know where one was with it, at least one could use one's very ignorance as a ground of assertion. To marry the principle of the Aristotelian doctrine of categories to the exposition of the relations of mnan to God was an intellectual achievement of the highest order. The analogy of the scholastics was fundamentally ontological. That is a commonplace of the text books. The modern reader therefore who goes to the schoolmen to find in their doctrine an answer to his peculiar problems is often rewarded and disappointed at the same time. He recognises the strength of an experiment (note that word) which seeks to avoid the twin perils of anthropomorphism and agnosticism in respect of metaphysical speech. This does indeed seem a brilliant definition of our actual intellectual experience when we hazard speech concerning God, freedom and immortality. We know we don't mean by God a super- designer, a super-architect, a super-what-you-will; we know that by human freedom we mean something that a mere description of the difference between spontaneous and forced action will not quite catch ; and again by im- mortality we mean a continuance that cannot be inter- preted simply in terms of the prolongation of life as we know it. Just as Socrates in the Republic was clear that whatever else the Idea of the Good was it was not pleasure, so we know what we don't mean even if we can't catch what we do. We are agnostics before we ever dare to make any kind of positive assertion, let alone advance any positive argument. When the schoolmen insist that agnosticism comes before anthropomorphism, we are with them all the time. But alas their device for allowing assertion on the basis of negation demands assumptions that we cannot make. For we have to admit in knowledge a kind of intuitive awareness of analogically participated being which we do not seem to have. The schoolmen admit a critical problem where speech concerning the ultimate is concerned. By what authority</page><page sequence="5">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 119 do we describe God in these terms or in those terms ? It was Aquinas himself who insisted that of God we knew that He was, what He was not and what relation everything else had to Him. It was a modern Thomist who spoke of the ways in which we name God as like the runways of the Clyde which issue ships on the ocean. The ways in which we speak of God issue us out on what Boethius called the ocean of His being; but whereas the runways of a Clyde contain the waters of the ocean at high tide, our names, and I suppose the thought which on a traditional view somehow corresponds with them, contain nothing of that which they name; they are runways and nothing more. No one could deny that this language, however metaphorical, states a critical problem. But suppose one has already raised a critical problem at what one may call a lower level. Sup- pose one has felt the sort of difficulties Hume and Kant experienced concerning such notions as substance and cause ; suppose further one has given the sort of solution to those difficulties which Kant gave in terms of his theory of the co-operation of sense and understanding in objective knowledge, according to which such categories as substance and cause become concepts of the way in which a discursive understanding necessarily spells out the order of experience. It is Kant's theory of the a priori, which contains in germ the whole of his meta-metaphysics, his whole description of the nature of metaphysical curiosity. Thus a modern theolog- ian, Professor Paul Tillich, is right in speaking of Kant's doctrine of categories as a doctrine of human finitude. So far from being a rationalistic justification of a claim to intuitive penetration behind the veil of sense, it is rather an attempt to set out the peculiarly limited character of human knowledge. Done once for all, it naturally invites the mistrust of those who see that the philosophical clarification of a concept is not something which can ever be done finally any more than the work of the psycho-analyst is something which can be set out in a few sentences. The Analytic and the Dialectic in Kant's first critique have to be unpacked, and the arguments set out in a different style if the modern</page><page sequence="6">120 D. M. MACKINNON. reader is to see the continuing worth of what the author was doing, the peculiar way in which he distinguishes the metaphysical from the ordinary use of concepts, even the lessons he would teach by his very using the word " use." Suppose there is an unbridgeable chasm between ordinary everyday description and the technical language of exact science, on the one hand, and the way we speak when we try to answer questions concerning our origin, our nature and our hope, when the word " ultimate " has been inserted before the last three nouns. Kant thought there was, and he believed moreover that this difference stood whether the metaphysical question was answered in the style of Haeckel and Marx or in that of Aquinas and -of Hegel. The violation in principle was the same. In the end Kant leaves us with the sort of model of the metaphysically minded which I have tried earlier in this paper to sketch. Of course in his writings his criticism of metaphysics simply prepares the way for his assertion of the primacy of the practical reason. But even those who cannot follow him here can learn something from the exhaustiveness of the way in which he delineates the plight of those who try to use the tools of ordinary empirical knowledge for opening the doors on the unconditioned. By his analysis of a priori knowledge he anticipated in a different style much thatis commonplace to-day. Any reader of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, for all the difference of inspiration, receives continual reminders of the Kantian distinction of the form and matter of knowledge, from which the critique of metaphysics inevit- ably springs.2 It is, of course, the character of metaphysics as somehow satisfying the urge for seeing things as they are which makes the metaphysical claim the enemy of scientific progress. For if we claim intuitively to see things as they are, we are unwilling to give proper attention to those who bid us revise our assumptions, change our frames of reference and so on. We have an almost classical example of this sort of 2. Cf. Prof. R. B. Braithwaite's Herz Lecture.</page><page sequence="7">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 121 obscurantism in the refusal of certain realist philosophers in this country to admit the very possibility of non-euclidean geometry. The refusal was grounded in the end in what I can only call a metaphysics of knowledge, which in the use made of it brought out, with examplary clarity, the sort of tyranny that metaphysical conviction can exert over the proper assimilation of new insights concerning the ways of human knowing. " Concern about the ultimate " may be a perennial factor in human life. It may even sometimes be a stimulant of scientific progress ; but it may easily lend its authority to canonising as dogma some particular systemati- sation of human knowledge. Those who gave a kind of canonical finality to Newton's view of the universe forgot the simple historical fact that such a view was once anything but self-evident ! The impulse to avoid the peculiar critical experience is strong in most of us ; it can easily pervert " our concern with the ultimate " into a false acceptance as final truth of that which in its nature is inevitably im- permanent and relative. No doubt Kant took Newton's physics as a last word ; no doubt too he was stupid to the point of perversity in the detail of his doctrine of categories. But he saw for all that the sort of job that category did in human thinking, and the sort of obstacles that the ines- capably categorical character of human thinking put in the way of metaphysical confidence. Whether we try to use our categories as ladders to scale the heights of heaven, or deify as metaphysical finality the cosmology of a particular age, we are dodging the critical problem, turning aside from the description of our actual intellectual situation. But what of meta-metaphysics ? It has the task usually of showing the invalidity of metaphysical assertion, of revealing the type-shift involved in arguing about the transcendent, or in converting a principle of method into a description of the ultimate nature of things. Whether the style which the meta-metaphysician embraces has the psycho- logical ring Kant's has, or whether it may be inspired by a delicate sensitivity to the workings of language, in the end the point made is the same:-the invalidity of the leap from</page><page sequence="8">122 D. M. MACKINNON. relative to ultimate. Yet there remains the whole series of attempts which men have made to catch the sense of their world, attempts made by poets and seers as well as by metaphysicians. There remain too the efforts made by those who were certainly not scholastic in their inspiration to set out the logic of the leap, and to vindicate the peculiar way the words work by which the leap is made, even some- times to provide criteria whereby one can sort out, even at these levels, the valid from the invalid. I mention the poets ; sometimes, as Professor Wisdom has said, and indeed borne out by his own practice, the philosopher must play the poet, and this of course not only, as I had implied in his speculative moments, but even in the style of his criticism. Certainly the metaphysician's use of words has something of the poet's boldness, even if his justification is of a different order. For it has been a common feature in the practice of metaphysicians to claim tight logical grounds for what they say, to set out arguments in the form of syllogism, or inductive inference. Meta- physics has often simulated the style of a logical system; criticism of metaphysics has often followed revolutions in logic, in the understanding of logical truth. And this is as true in its way of Kant as of Wittgenstein. Suppose, however, one does try to free metaphysics from enslavement to the sum of its traditional models. Take for instance the so-called causal argument for the existence of God. As we have traditionally received it, this argument depends on an intuitive grasp of the principles of being, the sort of intuition I spoke of before in this paper. Granted that we do possess the capacity of such insight, one can state the argument in the form of a syllogism. But have we such capacity ? Can we gain such insight, or make it our own by framing it in an intelligible sentence ? But even sup- posing one can frame the principle on which the argument hangs, how can one justify what one says as more than the expression of a mood ? That men have seen, have written of things as pointing beyond themselves (and the writing is perhaps the seeing), no one would deny ; but what of the</page><page sequence="9">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 123 claims made for such supposed insight, for the logical powers of the expressions in which it becomes articulate ? Does not metaphysics sometimes emerge as the attempt to convert poetry into the logically admissible ? If one starts from a critical position, one can see the metaphysician's enterprise as almost an attempt to destroy poetry by converting it into syllogism, or into quasi-science of fact, to destroy even as the claim is extended to the point of maintaining that here we reach the ultimate. Yet the issue of attaching the unfamiliar vision to the familiar description remains ; the attachment of the strange to the usual, of the final to the relative. Few of us find it easy to accept the principle on which the doctrine of the analogy of being depends, that is the conception of being as an analogically participated transcendental ; yet we may be thankful for the statement of this doctrine as revealing something of what the problem of metaphysics is. We may even in certain moods envy those who can accept analogy as men who have at their disposal a supremely effective device for reconciling the logic of the familiar with that of the unfamiliar. The close understanding of the gulf between ordinary and transcendent description which we owe to Kant and his successors prohibits our acceptance of what scholastic analogy promises, and leaves us with the problem of the relation of settleable and unsettleable questions. But why bother about such a problem? Why not simply dismiss metaphysics as illusion, or else follow Colling- wood in substituting for metaphysics the uncovering of the fundamental assumptions of our age ? Why bother that people have written this sort of elusive nonsense ? Lay bare the fault, the confusion that lies at the heart of the enterprise, and there is an end of the matter. Why is there a problem of the possibility of metaphysics ? As soon as the meta- metaphysician has done his work, is not the impulse gone ? The trouble is that it remains somehow incorrigibly active. The best meta-metaphysicians have always seen this, and have therefore written works that seem themselves to have a certain metaphysical flavour. I tried to bring this out</page><page sequence="10">124 D. M. MACKINNON. where Kant was concerned by a deliberate choice of metaphorical language when I spoke about him. Had I gone on to deal with his ethics, which to some extent play the role of metaphysics in his developed system, I would undoubtedly have become more metaphorical still. Perhaps to some people, it is in the domain of ethics that the impulse to continue using seemingly nonsensical language is most persistent. For after all the moralist has somehow to do justice to what he learns of human life from writers like Tolstoy and Dostoievsky, George Eliot and Joseph Conrad; his theorising is impoverished if he ignores the dimensions of human experience to which such writers admit him. It is only if we remember these things that we can begin to understand the impulse that lies behind what the intuition- ists are trying to say in their controversy with the utilitarians, a controversy which incidentally John Stuart Mill seems to have understood better than almost any one else before or after. The utilitarians are fully justified in bringing the charge they do against the intuitionists, of seeming to favour appeal in moral questions to some mysterious faculty of insight into the suptra-sensible as against their own reliance on observed consequences. Certainly the utilitarians had every ground for mistrusting the intuitionists' claim to know transcendent principles of obligation ; such claims to knowledge can easily be used to bolster superstition of every sort, as for instance the thesis that pain ennobles. The appeal to fact in ethics is often a liberation from bondage. Yet others than Mill have turned aside from the con- struction of all principles of conduct into the utilitarian model. The attempt, as Butler had seen, inevitably dis- torted the actual situation of human beings, by blurring irreducible differences between various sorts of human relationships. Utilitarians can easily completely misrepre- sent the distinction between public and private obligations. There is a vital distinction between a diffused concern for human welfare as such and the sort of situations which arise at the more intimate levels of human existence.</page><page sequence="11">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 125 It is to the intuitionists that we owe this insistence on the plurality of our obligations. Yet to set out their deep perception, they have often relied on a sheerly vicious epistemology. Regularly we find them writing as if moral insight consisted in a grasp of the axioms of moral space; a model in every way intolerable, not simply by reason of the ignorance of modern geometry which it displays ! But for all that the intuitionists have brought out the complexity o- what we mean by morality, that it is not something which can be contained in a simple formula. I have referred to this familiar controversy, because one can surely discern a certain parallel between what is said here about ethics, and what I have said above about metaphysics. The intuitionist is a sort of ethical meta- physician ; he insists that the principles of conduct cannot be set out as if their sole sanction could be found in the observable consequences of behaviour. He does his job clumsily ; the novelists really do it better. But they are not philosophers any more than the poets are ; and if their insights are to be given systematic form, it must be for the philosophers to attempt the task. It is as if there were both in the realms of understanding and of conduct a circle within which what one said and what one intended was perfectly clear and intelligible. Yet whether one thinks about being or about conduct, whether one tries to represent one's world or the conduct of individuals, to confine oneself within this circle is to omit what is only left out at the risk of a deep impoverishment. (Note the metaphorical language.) But of course when the philosopher tries to make good such impoverishment, he is always tempted to trace out schemes of pseudo-explanation or to evoke the perilous mythology of a faculty of intuition. He is also tempted to belittle, if only by the lack of time which he gives to them, the work of the physicists and the work of the psychologist. In love with the phantom of an ultimate explanation, the metaphysically minded philo- sopher is quite careless about scientific explanations and their logic.</page><page sequence="12">126 D. M. MACKINNON. But this paper bears the title of metaphysical and religious language. So far I have been concerned with some sort of examination of metaphysical language. What of religious ? I hope I may be forgiven if in this second part of the paper I confine myself to Christian religious language. I can, I think, plead in extenuation the fact that the very concept of metaphysics, that besets the consciousness of those concerned with its possibility, is one that owes something to the interplay of religion and metaphysics in the Christian tradition. The metaphysical language with which we have been concerned is one which often suggests to the modern philosopher explanation beyond explanation, insights re- vealing realms of relationship beyond the obvious. But characteristically religious language, the language of prayer and liturgy, does not purport to be descriptive or explanatory in the way in which some metaphysical language certainly sets out to be ; it might indeed be said that liturgical language provides the philosophical student with some truly classical examples of what Professor Austin has called its performatory use. Of course religious language is often suffused by the language of metaphysics ; for no religion easily survives without a theology and theology is almost inevitably drawn to the style of metaphysics (even when it is also concerned, as Christianity has been, to establish some sort of relation with history). Yet within theology itself in the Christian tradition, the relations of theological and metaphysical language provide a continuing focus of controversy; I suppose that the historian of dogma might find a classical instance of this in the intellectual and public careers of Athanasius ; yet the theme is an everlastingly recurrent feature of Christian history. It was no doubt to some aspect of this story that Whitehead wished to call his readers' attention when he spoke of Christianity as a religion perennially in search of a metaphysic. Religious and metaphysical language ; the contrast is less familiar than that of metaphysical and scientific language, or of metaphysical language and the flexible</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 127 universe of ordinary discourse. Yet the contrast of styles is illuminating, whether one confine one's self to theological language in the abstract, or studies that language in relation to the total symbolic expression of a great religious tradition such as Christianity. I have mentioned the language of liturgy and prayer; it remains true, however, that one of the formative literary expressions of Christianity is the four Gospels. It is a commnon place of modern New Testament scholarship to insist on the uniqueness of the Gospel form it is also becoming a commonplace to see in the Gospel of John a crucial attempt to find a language capable of fusing that of the historian, the metaphysician and the mystic. I am aware that this is inaccurately said ; perhaps I should have said the poet rather than the mystic. But if I used the latter word, it was because I wanted to bring out the essentially religious character of the author's achievement. Certainly by the peculiar interplay of factual description and metaphysical meditation, characteristic of his work, John has offered to my mind a decisive presentation of the intellectual problem at the heart of the Christian religion.3 There is a very important sense in which the peculiar problem of metaphysical language is a different problem from that of religious language ; but the two are intimately related for us because of the actual history of our culture and the impact of theology on metaphysics in the middle ages.4 Very often what gives the metaphysical problem the flavour it has for us is this background of history. The very images which attend our representation of the problem to ourselves are partly religious ; I mean the sort of vague pictures that attend our frustrated demand for the sense of our existence. No one would easily admit the relevance of those images to what we are asking ; but none can deny their power. What 3 All this is very badly said; but these brief reflections on recent work on the fourth Gospel by such men as Hoskyns, Cullmann, and Dodd will be developed in another place. May I simply for the present insist the progress in the study of religious language can only come by the most detailed attention to its classical expressions ? 4 Compare the important writings of M. Etienne Gilson.</page><page sequence="14">128 D. M. MACKINNON. is this penumbra5 of human life and existence that we try to catch ; is not this reality that we try vainly to attach to the familiar in some sense a religious reality ? Sometimes too the language we use to represent the futility of our specula- tive efforts to scale the heights of the unconditioned recalls that of the mystics who have spoken of the dark night. So religious are our metaphysical bewilderments that we are at first sight shocked by recognition of a possible antagonism between metaphysics and religion. In Kant ethics and religion are almost identified ; yet that philoso- pher's confidence in discarding the scheme of analogy, sprang in a way from a conviction that he was liberating the essence of religion from a false entanglement with meta- physics. Those who have followed the history of theology in the 19th century will remember that the antispectulative influence of Kant persisted in European Protestantism as a vital counter-poise to the influence of Hegel ; and that in Britain at the beginning of the 20th century, it was Kant who enabled Peter Taylor Forsyth to shape his remarkable essays in Christology. I suspect that from the use which Forsyth made of it, we can learn much of the inwardness of Kant's criticism of metaphysics. The criticisms levelled (however unfairly)6 by theologians like Forsyth and Hegel are in the end criticisms of an attempt to subdue the Christian religion under the sovereignty of metaphysics. The study of the Christian protest against the Hegelian philosophy of religion, is one which throws a bright light on the claim of religious language to be some- thing other than a mere chapter of metaphysics. The argument served men like Forsyth and Kierkegaard with their opportunity to lay bare in new ways, private to them both, that peculiar uniqueness in the language of the 5 I owe the impulse to use this word here to the use it has been given by Professor Wisdom; I am not suggesting that I am using it in quite the same way. 6 Any serious student of philosophy must be deeply grateful for the work on Hegel at present being done in France by men like M. Hyppolite, and M. Jean Wahl.</page><page sequence="15">METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE. 129 Christian religion which in the beginning, the Gospel form tried to catch, and in the traditions of Catholicism, the pattern of liturgy to express in the language of prayer. Even those who reject Dr. Karl Popper's interpretation of Hegel may be interested to notice the way in which in The Open Society7 he quotes from Karl Barth's Credo. He obviously finds in that most deeply anti-metaphysical of modern theologians something that appeals to him. Primarily, of course, it is Barth's unwillingness to treat historical development as if it were a kind of moral and spiritual authority which Popper enthusiastically welcomes. But Popper also makes clear that what he welcomes in Barth is not simply the latter's sense that the horizon of the future is incapable of determination by metaphysical speculation; he also seems to appreciate the grounds Barth offers for his agnosticism concerning the meaning of human history, namely his emphases on the cruciality of the particular figure of Jesus. There is no doubt that Popper's quotation of Barth possesses a deep significance. It shows how a philosopher of strongly empirical bias can discern and welcome the element of positivism undoubtedly present in that theologian. Indeed any theologian who stresses as Barth does the ultimate particularity ofJesus and who claims to find in him and not in the gropings of speculation the ultimate sanction and direction of his thought, might have an equal attraction for someone like Popper, and for the same reason. There is of necessity a continual shift and interplay between what we call metaphysics, and religion and theology. The laws governing the languages of religion and theology are not quite like those, if such there be, which govern impulses of metaphysical speculation. Indeed it is one of the ends of this paper, to bring out with the aid of historical allusions, how very different they are. Yet more than the mere fact of their interplay makes the philosopher 7The Open Society, Vol. 2, pp. 259f.</page><page sequence="16">130 D. M. MACKINNON. judge the problem which they both raise to be that of their validity. The differences are crucial; it is, I think, of real importance for the philosopher to bring out those differences. Detailed description can undoubtedly rid us of some besetting confusions ; it is certainly a necessary prolegomen- on to an informed judgement on the claims of these sorts ot language. But where description passes into justification I am not at present clear.</page></plain_text>
