<plain_text><page sequence="1">The architecture and planning of the nineteenth-century cemetery, by James Stevens Curl We are all familiar with the presence in our towns and cities of those huge burial grounds and cemeteries laid out in the nineteenth century, but few people know or appreciate them. To most persons a cemetery is a place to be avo ided. The grand cemeteries of the last century were showpieces of the time of their creation. They were products of a radical reform movement just as significant as those other political and sanitary reforms that were a feature of the liberal climate of the epoch. It is tragic that in an age when so much lip-service is paid to conservation, the cemeteries are not appreciated as they should be. Great surprise is often expressed when an interest in cemeteries and other aspects of a celebration of death is declared. Such an interest is today regarded almost as a perversion: it is in the same position in the con- versations of polite society as was pornography some years ago. The post-First War generation rejected the dark romantic gloom of Vic- toriana, and demanded an unmysterious church, a neatly clipped garden of rest, a bright and shining worldo The leafy melancholy of the Victorian cemetery, the dark mourning of Victorian clothes, and the sombre hush of the Victorian parlour were no longer acceptable. Indeed, the contemporary trend is to look on the Victorian celebration of death as something of a joke. In a way, this view is an over-compensation for a current fashion to make as little fuss about death as possible. Yet there is something about the Victorian celebration of death that is touching, pathetic, and rather absurd. it would be a great mis- take if we were to dismiss it as hypocrisy, commercialism, or fraud. The huge cemeteries laid out in the nineteenth century provide badly needed open spaces in populous areas, and they contain fine planting that has now matured, so that their benefits as amenity spaces are incalculable. It is my contention that the cemeteries of the past will become the sanctuaries of sanity and peace for the future within the turmoil of city life, and that it is therefore imperative to preserve them for what will be a truly religious function. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there was a great interest in the study of antiquities. The mediaeval monuments and sepulchral crosses and stones of the past were recorded and published in large and beautifully bound volumes which graced many a great library. The mediaeval cross at Kilchoman on Islay, for example, was recorded as was the wonderful old cross at Tireeo The charming Death and the Maiden from a churchyard in Tiree is expressive of an attitude to death which is infinitely more healthy than the smug pretence of today. In Kilchoman too, a seat of Christianity from the earliest times, extra- ordinary anthropomorphic stones still exist, together with more of the commoner type of incised slab, decorated with swords, skulls and crossbones, and arabes- ques. Shelley's vision of the cemetery was based upon his experiences in the classical lands of the south. To him, "The cemetery" was "an open space among the ruins, covered in winter with violets and daisies. It might make one in love with death, to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place". But such a view of the cemetery or burial-place would not describe the conditions prevailing at the beginning of the nineteenth century in Britain. 13</page><page sequence="2">rrt ; z - b o e-4&gt; -o .w - :t a .

TH W%IT Of</page><page sequence="3">After the establishment of the Christian church the catacombs were held in reverence for many years. Churches were first erected over places of burial and the next step was to reverse the process and to bury the dead under or near churches. We are told that the emanations from the bodies of saints exercised a peculiar virtue upon all those who lay near them. The odour of sanctity may have been beneficial in more than one sense, for cemeteries and churchyards passed under the control of the church, and the clergy became largely dependent upon the fees charged for interment. As the churches themselves became the burial grounds, the floors became filled with corpses, whilst the churchyards themselves became overcrowded, especially when coffins became obligatory. It appears that boxing a body originated in the attempt to preserve the corpse as long as possible, this being encouraged by Christian belief in a material resurrection. To some, until fairly recently, a coffin was the symbol of re- spectability, and so the undertaker could find in poor districts a ready demand. In mediaeval times it was customary to bury generally in very shallow graves, without coffins, so that every few years the bones were disinterred and stacked in the charnel-house adjacent to or under a chantry chapel where Masses were said for the repose of the dead. The excess humus from the churchyard was then distributed over the common land, therefore a proper ecological use of the burial grounds was maintained. With proper use of cemeteries and burial grounds there can be no question that "burial uses land". Evelyn describes churchyards in Stuart times as being filled to the very top of the walls. The chaos may be imagined when plague made its regular visi- tation. It had become apparent that some radical, hygienic method of disposing of the dead should be adopted. John Evelyn campaigned for the formation of cemeteries outside the city after the plague, but it was not until the nine- teenth century that major reforms were made, although the Dissenters had formed their own model cemetery at Bunhill Fields in the seventeenth century. Sir Christopher Wren had indeed proposed cemeteries situated in the outskirts of towns where beautiful monuments could be erected. But while the rationalists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries agitated, they did not have much success. Bunhill Fields, the Dissenters burial ground might be regarded as a small-scale model of what Evelyn and Wren had in mind for the city as a whole. The name apparently derives from a deposit of more than a thousand cartloads of bones removed from the charnel-houses of old St Paul's Cathedral in Elizabeth I's reign. During the plague of 1665 the ground was used as a burial place. Edmund Curll published a register of burials in Bunhill Fields in 1717. Al- though it had always been understood that the Dissenters' Burial Ground was to remain for ever intact, it fell into the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners who had no disposition to concur in the arrangement for its pre- servation. But the City of London, aware of the antiquity of the spot as a place of extra-mural sepulture, declared its willingness to accept the care and preservation of the ground. In other countries burial of the dead had long been handled in a civi- lised way. In the ancient city of Salzburg, for example, the old burying ground of St Peter's is a model of urbane peace and calm. The arcaded tombs have beautiful wrought-iron work at the entrances, and surround a central space for normal earth burial. The catacombs are set into the rock, and monumental slabs are set behind protective grilles. Elsewhere in the city it is possible to pass 15</page><page sequence="4">/ I lb I L. ; i....- Kendall's design for the interior of the chapel, Kensal Green. Lithograph by Thomas Allom.

Pass through an archway, however, and you are in an enclosed square with a mortuary chapel in the centre. All around is a cloistered walk with arcades. Within the arcades memorials are set against the walls. Many celebrated families are buried here. In the eighteenth century many of the Scottish cemeteries were, of course, quite unattached to the churches. The cemetery of Calton Hill is justly famous and is a delightful place now the trees have matured. It contains streets of tombs and monuments to great men such as Hume. Within this cemetery it appears that one is within a town, literally a necropolis or City of the Dead. There are charming examples of tombs of the Gothic style, while Classical Soanesque examples may be found as well. It is significant that in Scotland the cemeteries are not tucked away discreetly, but are placed quite often in dom- inating positions on hilltops. In Georgian times the churchyards had generally sunk to absolute chaos. Added to the obscenities of overcrowded burial grounds were the activities of the resurrection men. It was therefore in the eighteenth century that the churchyards became surrounded by massive iron railings, and individual graves were covered by huge slabs of stone, by altar-tombs, or by mort-safes. There are examples from the old churchyard in Cathcart and other burial grounds which show the kind of precaution that had to be taken. In Paris new cemeteries had been laid out in the eighteenth century and these became models for other countries. Articulate opinion was aroused, and the climate was almost ripe for the establishment of the large cemeteries in the great cities. Many towns, however, had pioneered the formation of large or fairly large cemeteries away from the centres of cities. Apart from the French examples, it was where the rational ideals of the French Revolution had begun to be accepted, or where liberal ideas were breaking to the surface, that graveyards were set aside and apart from cities and from churches. Belfast was among the most progressive in this respect, and both Friar's Bush and Carlisle Circus were founded at approxi- mately similar times. The latter is a remarkably beautiful and peaceful place with a walled enclosure and fine classical tombs set against the stonework. Here the sister of Henry Joy MacCracken is buried, and it is rumoured that the body of Henry Joy himself was secretly buried here after his violent death. Something of the attitude of the rationalist and revolutionary reformers who established these cemeteries may be summed up in the tombstone of Dr Young in the Carlisle Circus graveyard. The mural tablet simply says "Young! moulders here 1829'. The humorous yet realistic attitude presented by Dr Young's grave- stone is the antithesis of the sanctimonious expressions found on many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century monuments. 1789 and 1798 had their influences on the formation of cemeteries, as opposed to churchyards. The nineteenth-century funeral procession was an extraordinary sight. The leading coach was the hearse, and often it was preceeded by mutes and other attendants carrying the trappings of mourning. The hearse itself was black, with glass sides, sometimes etched with designs resembling those in the glass of the public houses. There was much silver and gold decoration, and under a huge canopy of black ostrich feathers lay the coffin, shiny and polished, with mouldings, expensive metal handles, and engraved inscribed plates. Black horses with plumes of black ostrich feathers pulled the gorgeous object, sometimes at walking pace, if feather pages, outriders, mutes, wands, and batons, were to 17</page><page sequence="6">8T *? znqz'S uT sjaq. STOT'[0 X.z.amaL *r -L ... "' 'd P ' D m, - ........%..1, .</page><page sequence="7">compose the full extras of the funeral. One of the grandest of all funeral cars was that of Lord Nelson in 1806. It was designed on the lines of the Victory complete with the figurehead, the whole being covered by a draped canopy topped by six plumes of black ostrich feathers. Sometimes there were attempts to dis- pense with horses, to avoid cost, and a Mr H.W. Jukes invented a carriage for walking funerals which had a cross-handle in front for two persons to haul by, and two handles behind to assist to push the truck-hearse up hills or to retard it when going down. Wellington's funeral was the apotheosis of all Victorian funerals, grander than that of either the Prince Consort or the Queen. The ephemeral objects of the celebration of death are not only the cem- eteries, tombstones, and monuments: they are the expressions of social position and status found in coffin plates and handles, in hearses, in mourning-cards, and in dress. They are the faded mementos of another age: the black-edged mourning envelope; the electro-typed flowers and leaves of wreaths under glass domes; the embossed patterns of the borders round verses celebrating deatho Mourning-cards were a phenomenon of the Victorian celebration of death. These were supplied by the undertaker, specially printed for the particular funeral in black and silver on white, and frequently embossed with traditional symbols of grief: the inverted torch, the weeping willow, the shrouded urn, and kneeling female mourners. These cards were in turn mounted on highly ornamental embossed fretted memorial-card mounts, usually black and silver, with patterns of in- verted torches, palms, broken columns, ivy, and much Gothic ornament. Black sealing wax, black stamp boxes, black ink, and mourning-pens were not unusual. Even aged aunts who suffered from deafness were provided with black jet ear trumpets covered in crepe and ostrich feathers. Many stores did a roaring trade in mourning accessories, and Jay's of Regent Street made a fortune out of their mourning department. Liverpool was among the first cities in Britain to establish a cemetery. St James's Cemetery was created from a disused stone quarry during the years 1825-29 at a cost of ?21,000. It was for many years the chief burial place of Liverpudlians. The architect was John Foster who made a dramatic setting for this great necropolis. Huge ramps were constructed with paths to convey the funerals to the sunken floor of the cemetery. Catacombs were hollowed into its stone walls, and tunnels were hollowed out of the rock to provide awe-inspiring settings for the interment of the dead. The power and scale of this cemetery were immense, and it had an almost macabre effect as it mouldered in the damp atmosphere. Unfortunately it has undergone a transformation which commenced in 1969, and has lost much of its atmosphere and robust character. Among the monuments is the little circular mausoleum of the Member of Parliament, William Huskisson, who was killed while attending the inauguration of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was designed by Foster and contains a statue of the M.P. by the celebrated John Gibson. It is said that Huskisson's indecision in gett- ing out of the way of the engine reflected the vacillation of his political life. There was much agitation for the formation of cemeteries in the south. The redoubtable barrister, George Frederick Carden can take most of the credit for the moulding of opinion so that the great cemeteries could be created in Britain. The Penny Magazine had for years given him great coverage in his cam- paign to improve the burial grounds of Britain. It was Carden who convened a meeting in 1830 to ascertain the best mode of improving the system of burial in 19</page><page sequence="8">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Ie vt.~*~ 0 7-' '' - -.,i. .?, .?. - *hy .. . .*W .d' ? - o . .

At a meeting in the Free Masons Tavern in that year a new company was formed to be called The General Cemetery Company. One of the great problems in setting up a non-denominational public cemetery, however, was the vexed question of compensation to clergy if a vested interest existed. This was got over by payment of a fee to the parish from which the corpse came. In 1831 land was purchased at Kensal Green just off the Harrow Road in what was then a completely rural landscape, and in the following year the Com- pany secured an Act of Parliament to facilitate its activities, and a Board of Directors was appointed. It was decided, however, that for Kensal Green the Pdre-la-Chaise model was to be the basis upon which the design would be con- structed. Within the general lay-out, as in Pere-la-Chaise, the public was to be at liberty to erect whatever sort of monument it pleased. .An architectural competition was held for the design of the buildings. These were to consist of a chapel with ample vaults, a principal entrance gateway with lodges, and other incidental structures. In 1832 a hundred guinea first premium was awarded to H.E. Kendall for his designs in the Gothic mode. The Company decided to accept Kendall's Gothic designs but one member gave notice that he intended to press for the resolution to be rescinded. Kendall's proposed picturesque arrangement of the cemetery ground is remarkably fine and includes winding avenues, a great circular avenue with a central monument, an extraordinary fantasy in Gothic for the chapel, a watergate through which funerals could proceed from the canal, and a robust entrance gateway on the Harrow Road. The Gothic style was generally approved of because it was associated "in the minds of all with ideas of devotion and religious feeling". It was felt that the Englishman was little disposed in times of bereavement: With Classic eye to trace Corinthian beauty or Ionic grace and the pointed style was thought to be apt. The nave and transept of the chapel were thought to be too florid, however, and it was felt that the slender proportions of the buildings, as well as the number of Kendall's spires and pinnacles were at odds with the sepulchral character of the edifice, but the romantic lithographs by Thomas Allom show very appropriate buildings for a cemetery. In March 1832 Kendall was subjected to an inquisition on his scheme, and the designs were denounced by Sir John D. Paul, the chairman of the Company. It appears that Paul had a persuasive personality, and he defeated the pro- Gothic camp in favour of the Greek Revival school. John William Griffith, the Company's surveyor, was then appointed to design the buildings for Kensal Green. A panorama, attributed to Thomas Allom, shows the cemetery as it was first laid out with a design for an entrance gateway, and the chapels and catacombs. This must have been before the buildings were actually finalised, for the entrance gateway as built differs from that shown on the drawing. The Dissenters' chapel is in the Ionic style of Greek Revival, and has flanking colonnades and subterranean catacombs. The bosky grounds contain trees which are now mature, and pretty classical temples alternate with Gothic tombs in a superb setting for the magnificent Anglican chapel with its prostyle tetrastyle Greek Doric porti- co. In front of the Anglican chapel are buried the Duke of Sussex (who refused to be buried at Windsor), and Princess Sophia, both children of George III. The beautiful quattrocento sarcophagus was designed by Ludwig Gruner and executed by 21</page><page sequence="10">:1 *' I Ztt Af a.

Messrs Noakes and Pearce of London built the podium. Beneath the Anglican chapel are awesome catacombs. In the dark vaults thousands of coffins, once clothed in rich-hued velvets secured to the wood by brass studs lie in serried rows on the shelves. The catacombs have a Piranesian intensity, and the images are unforgettable. The old or original catacombs, however, that adjoin the flanking wall by the Harrow Road have long been filled, and the arcades above are in a poor state of repair. The leafy walks, the classical tombs against the dark foliage, and its remarkable qualities make Kensal Green a very grand experience. G.K. Chesterton was, however, constrained to remark: For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen, Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green. There are indeed, and we shall travel to Glasgow where in the same year as Kensal Green the Glasgow Necropolis was formed by the Merchants1 House on a hill adjoining the Cathedral. East of the Cathedral, separated from it by the Molendinar ravine, the cemetery is constructed on a rocky eminence rising above the surrounding lands. The original proposal to form a necropolis on the site was made by the Provost, supported by the Collector and the celebrated Dr John Strang, the Chamberlain. Strang was to declare that he was solely actuated by the desire of awakening the attention of his countrymen to the generally neglected condition of the churchyards in Glasgow. Contemporary opinions of the Necropolis were favourable, but it was feared it would not be patronised by Glaswegians. An Edinburgh newspaper described Dr Strang as a "brilliant super- orthodox luminary burning in a dense cloud of Scotch prejudice and Glasgow smoke". It was originally intended to drive a tunnel through the hill with cata- combs off it, but this plan was abandoned. Instead, Egyptian vaults were con- structed, the site was surrounded by a wall, and secured by stout gates. One of the oldest and most conspicuous monuments is a Doric column surmounted by a twelve-foot high statue of John Knox, erected in 1824 before the cemetery was laid out. From afar this necropolis is a dreamlike vision of Attic splendour, almost unbelievable in the context of Glasgow. There are many fine tombs nearly all in the classical mode, as Gothic styles were thought to savour of Popery or High Church. When J.C. Loudon, the editor of the Gardener's Maga- zine, visited the Necropolis in 1842 he said that the impression was "grand and melancholy". He approved of the cemetery as supplying accommodation necessary for a rapidly increasing population. Loudon felt that by embellish- ing the place of sepulture so that it could be invested with more soothing associations, affectionate recollections of the departed might well be cherished. Many of these new cemeteries captured the imaginations of reformers. Many writers, from hack journalists to famous poets, took up their pens in the cause of the new hygienic cemeteries which had been pioneered on the continent. By 1839 Kensal Green and Glasgow cemeteries were flourishing. This en- couraged the formation of other cemeteries which followed in rapid succession from 1837. The first of these was established at Norwood by the South Metro- politan Cemetery Company on forty acres and consecrated by the Bishop of Win- chester in December 1837. The architect was Sir William Tite, who provided a fine and spacious design with an English landscape of clumps of trees and wide open spacious lawns leading up to the chapels on the hill. As usual there was 23</page><page sequence="12">-I -I II I - t n assay 6sss ^ eS TS^ R,4 Y ~r-a 3 4 e m__ fl at m e. k osw^at - innf.J 7 w16 BA rkU .u1r.t aouss uurw.Kc.1c 1 K ' i-S A' -- ,__r F ..

This time, instead of Greek, the style chosen was Perpendicular Gothic constructed with stock bricks with Portland stone dressings. There were Gothic arcaded wings with catacombs underneath. Unfortunately the chapels were damaged in World War II and they have been replaced by a crematorium of uninspired design. A print of the 1840's shows Norwood as originally laid out, but with J.C. Loudon's proposals for planting. The entrance gateway is still there. Many of the details at Norwood are particularly fine including the cast-iron railings, and the cemetery was dotted with magnificent tombs to rival those of Kensal Green. Loudon's connection with cemeteries is particularly interesting because he wrote a book called On the Layina Out Planting and Management of Cemeteries based upon articles he had published in the Gardener's Magazine. Loudon is a towering nineteenth-century figure; a self-made man par excellence. From humble beginnings he rose to a position of eminence as a prolific writer on architecture and landscaping. According to Loudon cemeteries could help to improve the moral sentiments and general taste of all classes, and more especi- ally of the great masses of society. Churchyards and cemeteries, he wrote, f"are scenes not only calculated to improve the morals and the taste, and by their botanical riches to cultivate the intellect, but they serve as historical records". The tomb has in fact been the great chronicler of taste throughout the world. In 1842 part of the land at Norwood was acquired by the Brotherhood of the Greek Community in London. In 1872 another piece of land was added, and in the same year Stephen Ralli obtained permission to erect a small chapel in memory of his son. The charming Greek Doric chapel with tetrastyle portico was designed by John Oldrid Scott who also designed the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in the Moscow Road. This Greek cemetery has many extremely fine and rich monuments, and is a little corner of the Mediterranean transplanted to London. One of the great difficulties with the conservation of Norwood has been the excessive rise in the cost of labour. The cemetery company ceased to operate in the 1960's, and Lambeth Borough Council has now taken over the responsibility for the ceme- tery. Loudon designed several cemeteries, having been foiled at Norwood. He was particularly interested in the project for a new cemetery on hilly ground. Highgate Cemetery has first claim to be the most unashamedly romantic of all the cemeteries in Britain. Like many others of the period, it was founded by a joint stock company. The cemetery of St James at Highgate was established by the London Cemetery Company. It is situated on either side of Swain's Lane near the old village of Highgate. The founder of the firm was Stephen Geary who also acted as architect to the Company which was incorporated in 1836. Geary was an extraordinary entrepreneur and architect who specialised in cemetery design and in gin palaces. I do not know if the two are connected. Part of St James's Cemetery, Highgate, was consecrated in 1839 by the Bishop of London. The layout of the cemetery was original, and the orderly subdivision into sections to facilitate the keeping of records was a necessary requirement of the Act of Parliament. The gate lodges were in a pretty Tudor-Gothic style, and the ceme- tery chapels also had Tudor overtones. The northern part of the cemetery was landscaped by David Ramsay, and the subterranean depositories and beautifully diversified grounds were improved in the 1840's under J.B. Bunning, the archi- tect to the company. James Bunstone Bunning, who subsequently became the City 25</page><page sequence="14">to Mr H. W.

The "neatly constructed chapel", described as "undertaker's Gothic"t had mechanically sophisticated devices for lowering coffins so that they could be taken out by a different route, a development of the catafalque idea found at the Kensal Green and Norwood chapels. Highgate is now excessively overgrown, but parts of the landscape have a curiously Italianate quality with magnificent views over London. The general state of the cemetery is absolutely lamentable, and the cemetery company, which was taken over bya body known -as United Cemeter- ies Limited, subsidiary of Raybourne Holdings, has not maintained the cemetery adequately. Vandalism has played its parto There are some wonderful images in Highgate Cemetery including eagles set among deep trees, and distant views of the spire of St Michael's Church, the parish church of Highgate. The most as- tonishing feature of the cemetery is the series of buildings which form the catacombs. An archway of the stern and appropriate architecture of Egypt leads into the Egyptian avenue and up a slope to the Cedar of Lebanon catacombs which are surmounted by a splendid cedar. These catacombs would make an ideal stage set for Mozart's Zauberflote, specially for the Temple of Isis and Osiris scenes. The Egyptian avenue has entrances to tombs on either side as it ascends the hill, and the lowering of the flanking walls with the ascent contributes to the illusion of great lengtho Each tomb is a square compartment with stone shelves for the coffins, and access to each compartment is through sadly decayed cast- iron doors. The entrance to each unit displays a curious mixture of Egyptian and Greek Revival elements. Around the Lebanon Circle are still more sepul- chres. The inner circle thus formed has tombs round its circumference, while from the centre, on the higher level, grows the tree itself. Steps lead up from this circular street of tombs to the higher ground dominated by the enormous mausoleum of Julius Beer and by St Michael's Church. Julius Beer's mausoleum was designed by John Oldrid Scott and built of Portland stone. The crypt itself was entered from the lower catacombs. At this level there is a long range of catacombs in the Gothic taste with buttresses and from here there is a wonderful view of the London skyline. In a recently discovered guide to Highgate cemetery I found an advertise- ment for various type of Victorian monument available in the early 1860's. The designs are a considerable improvement on the extraordinarily ugly monument to Karl Marx that stands in the "new" part of the cemetery. Highgate is neglected, however, and it is difficult to see what will become of it. Geary's London Cemetery Company lost no time in setting out a second cemetery for the interment of the dead south of the river. This time, as at Highgate, a hilltop site was chosen, Nunhead near Peckham. The fifty acres of the cemetery of All Saints were consecrated in 1840. Nunhead is Bunning's best known lay out in terms of landscape. But Bunning did not design the chapels. As at Kensal Green, a competition was arranged for the design of the chapels which seems to have been standard procedure, and this was won by Thomas Little in 1844. The Nunhead works were carried out under Little's supervision and are in chaste Gothic. The drawings of the Anglican chapel survive, including sections and elevations, and records exist of the Dissenters' chapel which has now been demolished. The entrance gates are classical, and have inverted torches, symbols of the extinguishing of life, and a grand formal entrance path leads from them to the Anglican chapel which, when I last visited it, was in a 27</page><page sequence="16">a- p. t 1 H- U - ~ ~ ~ 9 \ , . ., .

The next of the first wave of private enterprise cemeteries was Abney Park at Stoke Newington in London. This was opened by the Lord Mayor in 1840 and comprised some thirty-five acres. There is an oddly mean-looking chapel in cardboard Gothic and a fine statue of Isaac Watts who stayed at the house that formerly occupied the site. The architect for Abney Park was Professor William Hosking who laid out Abney Park between 1839 and 1843. The excellent planting, greatly admired by Loudon, is a delight, and a lesson to us how well the nine- teenth century understood the juxtaposition of trees and monuments. It was in every sense an arboretum, and each tree was labelled for the "edification of the working classes". Another private enterprise cemetery laid out at the same time was Sight- hill in Glasgow on a magnificent situation high above the city. There are many cast-iron monuments which provide a piquant contrast with the tower blocks of flats of the vicinity. Tower Hamlets Cemetery in the East End of London was established at the same time as Abney Park and Sighthill. It was consecrated in 1841. It has now been acquired by the Greater London Council as a future park. It also had cata- combs and chapels, but these were destroyed by bombs during the war. The grounds are quite astonishing, however, for here again nature has gone wild, as at Highgate, and forests of tombstones from the mid-nineteenth century vie with forests of trees, only to lose the battle. The density of burial must indeed have been high, and the place has a curious air of Cockney togetherness even in death. Tower Hamlets Cemetery seems to have become overgrown soon after its establishment, for Mrs Basil Holmes in her Burial Grounds of London, says in 1896 that it was "utterly neglected". This is one of the companies that appears to have run into financial difficulties early in its existence. Most joint stock cemetery companies that followed on Kensal Green and the Glasgow Necropolis were successful in part, but, as in the case of Tower Hamlets Cemetery, financial difficulties soon overtook many. Of particular interest in the period of the 1840's is the West of London and Westminster Cemetery at Brompton. This is probably the most formal of all the great nineteenth-century cemeteries. Although not consecrated until 1840, it has a long and interesting history. Few subscriptions were received for this Company, despite the fact that the Bill of Incorporation was introduced to the House of Commons in 1837. Stephen Geary was appointed architect in 1837. It was decided to offer premiums by advertisement for the best designs for the walls, chapels, catacombs, and buildings of the cemetery. As at Highgate, Ramsay was appointed as land- scape gardener. In 1838 the first premium was awarded to Benjamin Baud for his monumental design for a cemetery. Kendall got second prize and Thomas Allom worked with Kendall on the design. Early in 1839 Geary's resignation was asked for, and there was a great deal of litigation concerning fees due. I describe these actions in my book The Victorian Celebration of Death. Baud's design is formal in concept with a great central axis based on the gate lodge and the Anglican chapel. Enormous ranges of catacombs and a central circus flanked by chapels, one for Roman Catholics and one for Dissenters pro- 29</page><page sequence="18">P.&gt; L a i -*^; J J I Brompton catacombs. 30 t--L? r I I I- - I - - lb .</page><page sequence="19">vided the centrepiece of the design. Another range of catacombs flanked the west wall by the canal. A lovely view published early in the 1840's shows the design as it then sat within a largely rural setting. The dome of the Anglican chapel dominates the skyline. The screen wall along the Brompton Road is interesting in its arcaded effect filled in with railings, and the gate lodge is a monumental composition. Through this gate lodge the main axis runs along a street of tombs leading to the dome of the Anglican chapel. There are cupolas over the various entrances to the catacombs and the arcades. The chapels for Dissenters and Roman Catholics were never completed, nor were the flanking colonnades which remain bare and jerry-built in appearance. One of the diffi- culties of this cemetery was that there was so much building work carried out for catacombs that the capital costs were never recouped. Catacombs are largely wasting assets, for the cost of maintenance outweighs the burial fees. In addition, the cost of maintenance in perpetuity was soon outflanking the actual amount paid for burial. The Company therefore had large depreciating assets and great liabilities. The financial position was based upon the architectural con- cept, and Baud's relations with the Cemetery Company soon deteriorated. There appears to have been trouble with the workmanship too, for there were defects noted in the roof of the catacombs in 1843, but this was apparently due to de- fective work, rather than to inadequate specifications on the part of the architect. Baud was dismissed and brought a case against the Company for the recovery of fees. The trial was a disaster for Baud, and probably contributed to his early death. The Company paid no dividend for some time, and in ten years was practi- cally bankrupt. In 1851 the directors were anxiously watching the changes arising from the passing of the Metropolitan Interments Act. The experiment of establishing commercial cemeteries was not widely followed after 1850. Up to then the idea was favourably viewed, but a parliamentary report observed that interment of the dead was a most unfit subject for speculation, and in 1850 an Act of Parliament constituted a Metropolitan Burial District and granted the General Board of Health power to provide burial grounds and to purchase the commercial cemeteries which had already been established. In fact, only one, Brompton, was acquired, and the Act was actually repealed in 1852 when the Vestries were empowered to establish Burial Boards. It is clear, however, that the commercial companies suffered a great financial setback by the threat of what was virtually nationalisation. The directors of the West of London and Westminster Cemetery Company prayed in a petition that the Bill should be re- ferred to a select committee. There were considerable squabbles over the amount of money to be agreed in a financial settlement, but eventually the Company's property was purchased and the cemetery was placed at the disposal of the Chief Commissioner of H.M. Works and Public Buildings. In 1854 the Company was wound up. Brompton Cemetery is now administered by the Department of the Environment as successors to the Victorian body. Baud's conception is magnificent, and it is tragic the design was never completed, for originally, as can be seen from his drawing, the effect would have been grand indeed. Subsequent clutter has considerably lessened the archi- tectural integrity of the scheme. There are some early tombs to the south of the chapel which are classi- cally simple, while several monogrammed mausolea and one curious tomb of copper, 31</page><page sequence="20">*ToodJxAT'I AJaauxD e a saseure iS 1I^ F .; t' o . -* _.

This particular tomb was Leyland's, erected at the end of the last century, and celebrates Whistler's patron. It will be recalled that Leyland was the patron for the famous Peacock Room. But many other tombs were castigated, especially the monument of Coombes, the champion sculler, depicted on an upturned skiff. This was described as "bad and vulgar, so ugly as a whole, so execrable in its details". Mid-century agitation against intramural interment hotted up after the Metropolitan Interments Act. A new wave of agitation began, in the wake of a House of Commons Select Committee which uncovered a state of things in London which was described as "sickening". George Alfred Walker's Gatherings from Graveyards of 1839 revealed a situation in all its details to an astounded nation. The scandal of Enon Chapel helped to push things a stage further. This was a Dissenters' chapel where the coffins piled on top of each other were separated from the congregation by un-tongued and grooved boards. On hot days the smell was appalling. The graveyard of Spa Fields in Clerkenwell had no space left but it was always possible to get a grave there, apparently. Knight said that the age of miracles seems to have revived with regard to many of the burial grounds, but of all the marvels of the churchyard none could exceed that of Enon Chapel. In a space about 60 feet by 29 feet by 6 ft twelve thousand bodies were estimated to have been interred. Quicklime was used to hasten the destruction of the flesh, and the coffins were removed by the chapel staff and burnt. The custodians of many of the graveyards made a substantial profit out of stripping lead, handles, nails, and screws, and even the complete coffins themselves. From 1850 onwards various proposals were mooted, including the establishment of a distant Metropolitan Cemetery on a grand and comprehensive scale for the burial of all the dead of the metropolis. However, with the re- peal of the Metropolitan Interments Act confidence in the private enterprise cemeteries recovered, and although Brompton was bought up by the Government, a new company was floated which established the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum at Woking with an initial purchase of two thousand acres. The Company was incorporated in 1852 and the cemetery was opened in 1854. Arrangements were made with various parishes for the removal of the dead to the cemetery, and the greatest innovation of all was that the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company came to an arrangement with the directors of the London and South Western Railway whereby funerals would go by train to Woking. The result was a station by Tite in London, and a series of railway stations in the great cemetery at Brookwood, one for Dissenters, and the other for Anglicans. The Anglican chapel is a delightful building very much in the arts and crafts style, while the grounds contain tombs of all classes and creeds. The most interesting section is perhaps that of the Parsee section of the cemetery. Planting, by Tite, is grand, and embraces many of Loudon's ideas. Enormous redwoods have flourished in the gravelly soil and the scale is vast, the atmosphere is quiet, and in summer the place is infinitely pleasant. There are also some pretty little mausolea in the Romanesque and Gothic styles. One very curious aspect of my researches into Brookwood was the discovery of a drawing in the R.I.B.A. Drawings Collection for a railway station for a cemetery. It was captioned "Sidney Smirke's designs for a railway station at Brookwood Cemetery, Woking". I published this in good faith, but was amazed to have information from Australia. In 1868, people of Rookwood in Sydney, 33</page><page sequence="22">* S * I i. a. V^ . .i I ' . A ,.. If mou ld.I', h,'r( 1829 .I , ._ - ' , I I " F * I , .

This Gothic- style structure was the number one mortuary station and received the trains carrying the city's dead as they were taken to their final resting place at Rookwood cemetery. The architect was not Sidney Smirke, but James Barnet. Barnet was born in Arbroath in 1827 and studied with C.J. Richardson. He emi- grated to Australia in 1854, and presumably would have known about the Brookwood Cemetery promotions in England at that time. He published a paper in 1899 des- cribing the mortuary railway stations at Sydney and the cemetery at Rookwood showing the application of Gothic architecture to a novel purpose. Originally the building was known as the Receiving House, Haslam's Creek. It was built for ?4,407 by a Mr A. Loveridge. With the advent of motor transport the railway branch line fell into disuse in 1939, and the Receiving House became redundant. It was put up for sale in 1952 and the stonework was purchased by All Saints' Church in Canberra in 1957. In May 1958 the entire structure was transported to Canberra and converted into achurch. The result is a most extraordinary sur- vival of this monument of a great Victorian cemetery. The climate of opinion brought about by Government reaction and the en- couragement of public cemeteries was responsible for the passing of an Act of Parliament of 1852 when the Burial Boards were established. Several public cemeteries were formed. One of the first of these cemeteries was built in Finchley for the Parish of St Pancraso Two cemeteries from the period stand out as being of really splendid design. The first of these was the Paddington cemetery. P6re-la-Chaise was again the model, with a planned system of burial based upon the earlier Joint Stock Cemeteries. The influence of Loudon is apparent in the planting, and in Paddington we find a wealth of granite, pink, grey and green, imported from Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Stonehaven, which towns did a steady trade in stone shipped to the Port of London. Paddington Ceme- tery was designed by Thomas Little, who also designed much of Nunhead. The chapels are part of one complex, linked by two portes-cocheres with a belfry in the centre of the composition. The cemetery appears to be among his last works, for he died three years after it was opened. The style is utilitarian Gothic, and the whole is of an impressive simplicity. Of much greater importance than Paddington, however, is the grand and splendid City of London Cemetery at Little Ilford, opened in 1856. This was an attempt to alleviate the pressures caused by the closure of so many City churchyards. The cemetery was formed under the direction of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London from the designs and under the direction of William Haywood. Works of draining and enclosure started in 1854. All buildings except the catacombs were finished in 1855. The influence of Loudon is immediately apparent, for the beauty of the trees, rhododendrons, and azaleas echoes his praises of the arboretum at Abney Park, and indeed reminds us of his own treatise on the subject. The excellent stand- ard of maintenance is an indictment of certain companies and authorities who have let their cemeteries decay almost beyond redemption. The plan is ingenious. Curving roads wind through the cemetery meeting at points, at two of which the chapels are situated. The catacomb valley is formally planned near the eastern boundary wall. The low line of masonry of the catacombs contributes greatly to the quality of the landscaping. The chapels are in spiky Gothic. Haywood's own tomb is a mausoleum in the Gothic style set within the Arcadian landscape. The entrance gates very much recall Tite's designs for Norwood. 35</page><page sequence="24">V .X. - . s - r~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -~ ~ ~~ I ! 2' ..... .-t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I - ~~~~~...~. ? 4'I, - - ,, "* '-, ,' d . _,--AL+ , , * A t m -,, - .

The Albion was a battleship launched on the Thames in the 1880's, and during the launching cere- mony the platforms containing the spectators collapsed and many were drowned. In many of the local authority cemeteries a standard type of Gothic mortuary chapel was built with a porte-coch6re through which the funeral would pass for the unloading of the coffin before carrying into the chapel. Deptford is one example and Lambeth offers another. From the early agitations and reforms relating to burial, it is a logi- cal progression to cremation. No doubt classical history had played its part in drawing attention to the possibilities of cremation. Sir Thomas Brown had published Urne Buriall in the seventeenth century, and the Origin of Cremation by J. Jamieson had come out in the Proceedings of the Royal Society published in Edinburgh. In 1822 the drowned Williams and Shelley were both cremated on a beach in Italy. There was no option in the matter in the latter case, for Italian law required anything washed up from the sea to be burnt on the shore. Various publications relating to cremation were published in the 1860's and 70's. It was not until Sir Henry Thompson advocated cremation in the Con- temporary Review of January 1874 that interest was aroused on a national scale. In 1876 a congress was held in Dresden. In 1884 Mr Justice Stephen in Regina ve Price declared that it was not an offence to burn a body provided that no nuisance was caused. In 1875 the Council of the Cremation Society had decided to establish a crematorium, and in 1878 a site was selected at St John's, Woking, with apparatus designed by Professor Gorini. Cremation was legally sanctioned in 1885. The actual crematorium buildings in red-brick Gothic with stone dressings were designed and built in 1889 to designs by E.F. Clarke. One of the most interesting schemes for cremation apparatus was that of Messrs Siemens which consists of a gas holder, a furnace with a regulator and a space for burning and a chimney. The cremation process was carried out by gas con- ducted through a pipe provided with a regulating valve where, meeting with air, it burned fiercely. The flame extended through the chambers so that the brick lining was made white-hot. The covering of the chamber was removed, the coffin was lowered into position, and the cover was replaced. The picture of this apparatus in action is interesting because it shows the cleric and mourners as though round a grave, the coffin being lowered into the furnace. Since crematoria are now in use all over the country, it is astounding that their functional and liturgical bases have not been subjected to closer scru- tiny. Historically, the cremation movement was a secular one, and religious trappings have been grafted on later. The uncomfortable and unresolved design of crematoria appears to stem from this basic difficulty, although other factors, such as the desire to protect relatives from the facts of cremation, contribute to the distressing pseudo-gentility of many crematoria. We have seen, then, how the state of the churchyards in the eighteenth century worsened in the nineteenth with the growth of population in the expand- ing centres. Chaos resulted in emergencies, such as the cholera epidemics. Agitation for reform got underway. There was a certain amount of opposition from the churches because of loss of revenue as well as appealing to the religious significance of burial of the dead in churches. Contemporary des- criptions by Carden, Walker, and others, show the conditions in the city church- yards to have been vile. The nineteenth-century cemeteries, besides having the 37</page><page sequence="26">&amp; t I E - r -ji j IT ii r r^ It - , * E * X -;* '~~~~~~~~~~~~~ '-** t-. . ._^.;-* .

They were considered to be amenities, and their value as open spaces in the fully built-up urban matrix is of enormous importance. Since Victorian times cremation has been accepted. Labour costs and other problems have contributed to the decline of the upkeep of the cemeteries. The companies never were an enormous success financially, and the establishment of local-authority cemeteries hastened their decline. Attempts to get over the pleasing chaos of the Victorian cemetery by introducing the lawn system have only destroyed their character. The value of the nineteenth-century cemeteries today as open spaces in the metropolis is enormous. Trees are now mature; the groves and monuments have taken on the patina of age, and often, as in Highgate, an Arcadian quality exists which would be ruined by conversion to a pure park. Some cemeteries are dreary, however, and have none of the qualities of Ilford, Highgate, or Kensal Green. At present the cremation ceremony is an anticlimax. A curtain drawn over, or a coffin moving alone through a door or down a hatch, lacks the drama of a coffin going down into the earth or into a fiery furnace. This is a comment on our society, where death is played down and made apparently insigni- ficant, like suburban life. If cremation becomes universal, then it should be carried out with the conviction and panache that the Victorians brought to their cemetery designs. A crematorium must have other functions, for religious rites may be celebrated, and in most cases there will be friends or relatives present who are symbolically taking leave of a social personality. Throughout history, ceremony has been a factor in the disposal of the dead, and the rites involve actions, words, music, and movements that add up to a pattern forming the framework within which feelings are expressed. Crematoria simply use the burial service, clumsily adapted and inappropriately used for the purpose. It is not generally recognised that when cremation has finished the remains are still recognisable as being the bones of a human being. The ashes are cooled and then ground up in a pulveriser. Nails from the coffin are removed, and what finally emerges is a fine-ground grey powder. Quite apart from these considerations the amount of energy taken to destroy a human body is very considerable - it takes about an hour and a quarter in a furnace at over 1000 Centigrade. A great amount of gas is used, and in the process all the valuable constituents of the body are destroyed. It would be much less extravagant in terms of energy, and more ecologically apt to bury in the mediaeval fashion in shallow graves without coffins and reuse the ground. The bones could eventually be stored in catacombs. The possibilities for awe-inspiring designs are endless. Cemeteries are history and they are a repository of the history of taste. Often headstones in churchyards or cemeteries are removed or piled up against a wall on various pretexts: unsightliness, untidiness, difficulty of keeping the weeds at bay, and so on. I dispute the theory that the stones provide a bad setting for the church. I argue against the removal of any of the monuments, inside or outside, because I believe that they are a record of what people and craftsmen have felt about one of the great and significant human experiences. The reminders of death, inside and outside a church, or in the cemeteries of Victoria's reign convey an ever-present visual memorial to our collective past. 40</page><page sequence="29">Death is the supreme achievement of the end of a cycle. It is a rounding-off and a finale. The Victorians apprehended the problems with gusto and realism, a realism which we should be well-advised to study as lessons for our own half- hearted approach to the Celebration of Death. * * * * Illustrations nos. 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, are from photographs taken by the author.
