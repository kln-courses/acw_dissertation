Both Ovid and Virgil make fictional abstractions concrete and ontologically ambiguous. Innovations common to both the Aeneid and Metamorphoses constitute an impor tant stage in the emergence of compositional allegory', in the wake of the Roman adoption of Stoicising interpretative reading practices in the course of the first century BC. Both epics involve Furies as models for their major personified abstractions, both in narrative role and in concrete detail. Uniquely in and to Roman literature, Furies changed from supernatural beings into personified abstractions. This change, enabled by the semantic replacement of proper names such as Erinys or Eumenis with the word Furia ('frenzy'), produced new depth and complexity in the form and metaliterary function of personifications in Roman epic and later literary traditions.

Roman Personification Allegory The personification of abstractions, which gains unprecedented depth and complexity in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is an important strand within the history of literary allegory, which has over the last century evolved into an independent field of study.l) It is one of the more reliable ways of distin guishing between two different definitions of 'allegory (which are never theless complementary and not entirely separable): the responsive creation of two levels of meaning by the reader, and their intentional creation by the author. Many critics have acknowledged the difference and identified it by various labels; the present discussion will use Whitmans "allegorical interpretation" and "allegorical composition".2) Personified abstractions explicitly suture a literal form to a metaphorical one and therefore consti tute some form of allegorical composition. Simple personified abstractions are of course present in Homer and especially in Hesiod's Theogony, though most critics locate the birth of allegorical composition at some subsequent stage of enhancement in literary history: this milestone in the Western canon has been set at various points from Virgil's Aeneid to Prudentius' Psychomachia and beyond.3) In the following discussion I will argue that personified abstractions in the Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphoses share more than has hitherto been acknowledged, and that together they repre sent a critical 'Augustan phase in the development of personification in ancient literature. The uniquely Roman figure of the Fury, as portrayed in these two epics, becomes a personification as well as a supernatural sub deity, and this allows its concrete characteristics and ontological ambiguity to be transferred onto other personified abstractions, providing a new leg acy of allegorical composition for both Roman epic and Western literature as a whole. 1) In modern classical studies (as in antiquity), the nature of allegory has been most widely studied in archaic Greek literature, particularly Homer (e.g. T?te 1927; T?te 1934; Shipp 1965). From an interdisciplinary perspective, critics have traced the development of alle gory in the Western tradition, from archaic Greek poetry into English literature (Whitman 1987; Teskey 1996), though much theoretical work has come from the fields of Late Antique and Mediaeval studies (Buffi?re 1976; Lamberton 1986; Paxson 1998). 2) Whitman 1987, esp. 264.

Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 Allegorical interpretation was a popular mode of interpretation in the practice of Homeric criticism from early to late antiquity and beyond, perhaps as old as Homeric criticism itself, "a more or less continuous strand of literary thinking through the classical, Hellenistic, and early- and late Roman periods".4) In the Hellenistic period, scholars developed new forms of writing about writing?grammatical works, commentaries and critical essays?in which the interpretation of poetry became codified and aca demic. The world of Greek myth upon which Virgil and Ovid drew, and in which their narratives are often located, was to a great extent Homeric, and therefore conditioned by the scholarly, literary and pedagogic recep tion through which Homer was read at Rome.5) Although Homeric and Hesiodic personification allegories do not possess detailed physical attri butes or personalities, or interact with humans,6) allegory was a principal critical tool in Homeric scholarship, and inseparable from a literary read ing of Homeric and other epic texts. Allegorical composition, by contrast, explicitly invites readers to extrap olate secondary meanings from the visible content of a text, challenging the reader's interpretative abilities.7) The six extended personifications of Augustan epic are designed to surprise and challenge a reader equipped to apply allegorical interpretation and obtain two separate layers of meaning. As a result, they are never far from self-parody. The strongly personified personifications in Augustan epic are not merely human, but fantastical, reflecting a contemporary taste for descriptions not merely concrete, but grotesque. Ovid in particular shows a predilection for creating bizarre effects by literalising allegory and metaphor, either partly or completely; this is often done by causing nouns to straddle both sides of a metonymy.8) In the Aeneid, this technique is applied in cases where 'surface' (i.e. mytho logical) accounts, such as those of the Sirens, contain hints of an allegorical 4) Struck 2004, 18. 5) Cf.

Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 417 or rationalistic account, or vice versa.9) The bizarre disjunction inherent in double-dealing structures of thought such as personification, metaphor and allegory is one of the central themes of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Indeed, Quintilians and Cicero's translations of the Greek word ?^?-nyopia, con tinuae tralationes and continua metaphora, synthesise the programmatic mutatas formas and perpetuum carmen o? Metamorphoses 1.1-4.10) Virgil and Ovid present personifications as abnormal, hybrid forms, metaphors or allegories that are only partial and therefore, whether disconcerting or entertaining, a challenge to the reader. Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphoses contain six examples of strongly anthropomorphised abstractions, cases of what Feeney has called "extended personification allegory":n) a state or quality endowed with fea tures such as feelings, motivations, human-like form and human-like speech. Fama (Rumour) publicises Dido's relationship with Aeneas at Aeneid 4.173-97, and Somnus (Sleep) overcomes and drowns the helms man Palinurus at the close o? Aeneid 5 (838-61). Both reappear, reconfigured, in the Metamorphoses (Somnus at 11.592-677, Fama at 9.135-40 and 12.39-65) and are joined by Fames (Hunger: 8.777-878) and Invidia (Envy: 2.708-832). The difficulty of demarcating this type of figure with out unwieldy formulae such as 'strongly anthropomorphised abstraction stems from the fact that personification' accounts for a substantial and diverse range of metaphor. Feeney and Hardie have drawn attention to the role of personification in the poetics of Roman epic, particularly Ovid's Metamorphoses:l2) In the Aeneid and Metamorphoses, allegorical composi tion appears more strongly than in any prior extant text. This is a response to the ongoing influence of allegorical interpretation,13) through which 9) For allegorical or rationalistic accounts spliced with mythographical elements in Virgil (and his predecessors) see Hardie 1986.

N.D. 2.23.63, 3.17.44 and 24.62-3; cf. Wedner 1994).</page><page sequence="5">418 D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 Latin literature evolved its own poetics of personification in the late first century BC. The peculiar physical characteristics and functions of these creations, which challenge interpretation, playfully mirror their anoma lous and ambiguous ontological status. The concepts of personification' and both kinds of allegory' threaten to slip out of our grasp.14) Noting that endowing something with human qualities is a common strategy of metaphor, Claassen identifies numerous minor examples as "petrified personification", that is, personification whose literal dimension has faded.15) Faint forms of personification are present in the fabric of language itself, in metaphors both living and dead. Likewise, as Lamberton observes, "'Allegorical interpretation'... can comprehend virtually the whole of what we call 'interpretation', beyond mere pars ing".16) Finally, since the search for allegorical composition is an intention alist approach, there can be no objective, definitive conclusion about where it is to be found. Extended personifications cannot be extricated from the 'background' of Latin language and Roman culture. First, what Tissol has called Ovid's "sylleptic imagination" is in fact a universal habit of thought in Rome, and antiquity in general.17) In syllep sis, the same word is taken in two senses within a phrase, both properly and figuratively, fusing "within the same word a literal and metaphorical sense".18) Two areas of Roman culture related to myth, epic poetry and religious cult, allowed two-way commerce between a persona and a thing. One direction of transition is metonymy (e.g. Ceres meaning 'bread' and Mars meaning 'war'), the other is personification (the investment of a noun, either abstract or common, with the properties of a human),19) but 14) The study of personification in Roman literature is inhibited by confused or contradic tory use of terminology. This reflects, in part, the methodological difficulties of discussing issues not explicitly addressed in ancient sources. Reconstructing entire conceptual catego ries is one obstacle, and establishing the precise meaning of terms such as 'allegory', 'personification, 'metaphor' and 'abstraction is another. Feeney (1991, 37) notes "the clumsiness of our all-embracing term allegory'". 15) Claassen 1990, 103-4. 16) Lamberton 2004, 20. 17) Tissol 1997', passim. 18) Hardie 2002, 230. 19) E.g. hunc Pudor instimulat (V.Fl. 4.284-5) or Mors testis erit (Liv. 1.58.7). Both may be poeticisms: Lucretia's last words, including this phrase, may disguise a hexametric intertext: Brodribb 1910, 14.</page><page sequence="6">D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 419 the two are not always distinguishable. This interchangeability was far stronger in classical antiquity than today. Second, it is well known that modern editions defend us from a powerful ambiguity by the use of upper and lower case letters.20) We distinguish 'desire' from 'Cupid' because CVPIDO is printed either with or without an initial capital. The fact that editors have frequently made this orthographic distinction almost since the invention of minuscule script in the eighth century AD, and routinely done so since the eighteenth century, shows that ancient and modern con ceptual frameworks are very different.21) Third, Roman religion had a pro pensity for abstractions and this should not be overlooked as a possible influence on Rome's literary culture. Deified abstracts are attested at Rome as early as the fourth century BC, forming part of its self-perceived self fashioning: the cult o? Fortuna was traced back to Servius Tullius, and that of Fides to Numa.22) It has even been suggested that the numinous and animistic character of early Roman religion made it more receptive towards abstract concepts than the more anthropomorphic Greek religion.23) Yet personification is of course a kind of anthropomorphosis, and owing to the above-mentioned 'two-way commerce' even the most prominent gods in Rome's extensive pantheon were subject to metonymy.24) The existence of Greek prototypes for many Roman personifications limits the extent to which they can be linked to archaic Italian culture. Few of them were objects of cult at Rome,25) and in fact Virgil and Ovid, when not basing theirs on Greek models, created new ones.26) Schilling notes that two of the 20) Cf. Feeney 1991, 387. 21) This ambiguity is a major point of debate in Cic. N.D. (e.g. 2.23.60, 2.31.79, 3.25.63). 22) Plu. Fort. Rom. 5; Num. 16. 23) Claassen 1990, 103; for a more pejorative view see Hinks 1939, 111: "This explains both the eagerness of Roman religion to adopt the allegorical forms of thought and expres sion elaborated in the later Greek world, and also its lack of resource in dealing with them." 24) E.g. crassa Minerva (Hor. S. 2.2.3), sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus (Ter. Eun. 732). 25) Axtell observes over forty (beneficent) exceptions, whose cult is indicated by literary and/or epigraphic sources: fifteen from the Republican period, thirteen Imperial additions, and fourteen abstractions with unofficial cult (Axtell 1987 [1907], 9-48). 26) Ovid's Fames is based on Callimachus' Aiuo? (Cer. 66-8), Somnus is loosely analogous to "Yrcvoc, and Fama to Origin. Lnvidia equates to OO?voc (see Dunbabin &amp; Dickie 1983) or</page><page sequence="7">420 D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 abstract figures of Virgil's underworld entrance-way, mala Mentis gaudia and Discordia d?mens, are negative antitheses of Mens and Concordia, deified at Rome,27) though this is not the case for all twelve types of being. The 'extended personification figures in Virgil and Ovid, the objects of the present discussion, are not objects of cult at Rome.28) As a literary phenom enon they reflect the Roman reception of Greek allegorical interpretation, and of the texts (principally Homer) to which it was applied. A good reason for grouping the six abstractions together is that sharp distinctions between the 'psychological' and the 'physiological' are a mod ern phenomenon; the ancient perspective was more holistic.29) Personifi cations of emotional states such as Envy or Madness need not, therefore, be any more metaphorical than those of physical states, such as Death, Sickness or Sleep. Roman poetic metaphors describe passion (love or anger) through pathological effects, especially heat, flames, wounding, paralysis and melting. Invidiay Amor and other personifications of emotion are as physical and visual in their traits and effects as those conditions that mod ern readers would consider purely somatic. This is especially clear when Ovid's depictions of Invidia and Fames are compared, since they share many features, and occupy the same territory between the literal and the metaphorical. In Greek culture, personifications often exist in genealogies. In archaic literature in particular, kinship systems are drawn up between them much as they are between gods; for example, in Homer, Flight is companion of possibly Zr{koq: Hes. Op. 195-6 (never Nemesis, who was conceived of by the Romans as a Greek deity (Karanastassi 1992, 734): Ovid exclusively refers to the latter as Rhamnusisl Rhamnusia (Met. 3.406, 14.694) and Statius' Rhamnusia even tortures herself with Invidia (Silv. 2.6.73-7), which would be tautologous if she were Invidia herself. Nor is Nemesis sickly, unclean and melancholy like Invidia and Hesiod's Zfj?,o?: in Op. 175 both she and Themis are portrayed as attractive and wrapped in white robes). Many other precedents may be found in Hesiod (esp. Th. 211-32), and remaining figures can be attributed either to close analogues (e.g. Discordia-. Horsfall 2000, 224-5) or perhaps, of course, to lost mod els. Yet the nature and extent of Roman treatments are the real point of departure. 27) Schilling 1980, 197. 28) A possible exception is the epigraphically-attested involvement of Sleep in the cult of Aesculapius (Lochin 1990, 605). 29) The nineteenth-century science which foreshadowed 'psychology' was called 'mental physiology': Punter &amp; Byron 2004, 23.</page><page sequence="8">D.M.

This is because Roman authors, in a tradition deriving much of its authority from Hesiod's Theogony (esp. 211-32) and from Homer,34) depict personifications accompanying, and even interacting with, more concrete supernatural entities.35) This occurs most readily in chthonic or similarly unsettling con texts. Virgil populates the antechamber of his underworld (6.273-84) with a dozen personifications (including both Fames and Somnus synonym, Sopor).36) Subsequent groupings of personifications in Roman epic also occur in infernal contexts;37) this allegorical experimentation with the underworld turns it into a symbolic space, separated only partially from the world of humans. This could be connected with contemporary dispu tation over the 'reality' of the mythical afterlife and contestations over the value of mythological poetry.38) Ovid groups them around his extended 30) Gombrich 1971, 251. 31) Gombrich 1971, 251; Hinks 1939, 107. Axtell (1987 [1907], 64) states that this occurred in some, but not all cases. 32) One exception, the fraternal relationship between Sleep and Death {A. 6.277; Sen. Her. F. 1065-9), apparently alludes to earlier Greek literature (e.g. Hes.72?. 211-3; cf. Cic. N.D. 3.44). 33) Cic. N.D. 3.17A4. 34) The few, brief instances of personification in Homer, listed by Feeney (1991, 241), usu ally pair or group associated abstractions in a manner similar to Hesiod. 35) Of course, as discussed above, all gods personify their domains of influence to a greater or lesser extent. Nor can personifications be absolutely distinguished from gods: some were paid cult, and even those that were not are called deities in literary texts (e.g. Fama at A. 4.195 and Somnus at 5.841). 36) As noted by Solmsen (1972), the Underworld of A. 6 is heterogeneously populated by Homeric and non-Homeric, supernatural and abstract beings. 37) Sil. 13.579-87, Petr. 124. 38) Cicero's Cotta openly ridicules literal belief in the underworld (N.D. 2.2.5; cf. 1.38.108).</page><page sequence="9">422 D.M. Lowe ?Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 personifications, in remote, uncivilised lands,39) whereas Statius has them congregate in threatening situations.40) When appearing in such a list, personifications are usually stripped-down with a minimum of detail, barely enough to anthropomorphise them. In the Metamorphoses, none theless, they are grouped around three of the four strongly anthropomor phised abstractions.4^ Only Invidia is sufficiently antisocial to lack an entourage?though even she has anthropomorphised Frigus (Cold) and Curae (Anxieties) as her fellow-countrymen.42) We know too little about the genre of allegorical painting (implied by Lucian's description of Apelles' painting of Slander, Aioc?o^r|)43) to hypothesise an ecphrastic tradition inspired by 'group portraits' of personifications, but Augustan personification-lists tend to expand on their archaic epic precedents by providing visual detail. Ovid (and Virgil, in his description of Fama) employs the opposite method of creating a complex spectacle: a single extended description is itself a 'list' of symbolic attributes, though this is a radical departure from known precedents in Greek poetry. 2. Furiae Hardie deems the Virgilian Fama the inspiration for all four of Ovid's personifications, particularly Invidia,AA) but a second figure appears in both Augustan epics and links their use of personification, namely that of the Fury (Virgil's Allecto and Ovid's Tisiphone). The figure most strongly 39) With Lnvidia in 'the deepest of valleys' (Ov. Met. 2.761), with Fames at the furthest edge of Scythia (8.788), with Somnus near Cimmeria (11.592) and with Fama in a high citadel at the world's centre (12.39-43); followed by Stat.

Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 423 identified as both concrete supernatural figure and personification of an abstract quality is of course the Furia, no mere caique of the Greek Erinysy Enyo or Eumenis. Roman epic (largely due to Virgil's treatment) regularly associated the Furia both with the underworld and with irrational emotion and frenzy {fiiriae or furor) .^ Furiae in the Aeneid are already ambivalent, operating in the text both with a capital and a minuscule letter and carry ing the potential for allegorical interpretation even when physically described, or speaking, or motivating the plot. Allecto and her Ovidian successor, Tisiphone, are the models for the major personifications of Augustan epic: Ovid's Invidia, Somnus and Fames even follow the precise pattern of a goddess visiting an abstraction either personally or by embassy, who subsequently visits a mortal and indirectly seals their fate. Feeney sees the way that Ovid takes his cue from this?presenting his Tisiphone as "divine machinery with a vengeance, hyperbolical, redundant, and gratu itous"?as an attempt to render allegory preposterous and meaningless.46) Yet the Furies are already semi-metaphorical in the Aeneid (as indeed were the Greek Erinyes, viewed as tokens of parenticidal guilt), and Tisiphone is closer to Allecto than is generally thought. Besides being both literal and metaphorical, and acting as the hitmen of the gods, Ovid's Invidia, Somnus and Fames have a third thing in common with raving Allecto and Tisi phone: they operate in a 'medio-passive' way.47) In other words, they expe rience the effects they enact upon their victims.48) This tautologous property is perhaps the most insidious threat to the unity of the self, implying that the individual experience of a state is merely the emulation of an indepen dent figure. In this sense, abstractions are paradoxically more 'real' than the human personalities they affect. 45) Hershkowitz 1998, passim. Roman literature brings about an overall shift in the symbolic value of the Furies: though specifically avengers of familial crime in Greek myth, they became avengers of all crimes in the underworld and on earth, instigators of ('fratri cidal'?) war, and eventually all-purpose symbols of foreboding or funereal horror (Barchiesi 1992, 163). 46) Feeney 1991,240. 47) I thank John Henderson for this formulation. 48) Hardie (1999, 96) comments that this follows the logic of the transcendental paradigm, whereby an exemplum of a quality 'incarnates' that quality, and that personification allego ries therefore make their victims into versions of themselves.</page><page sequence="11">424 D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 As Feeney demonstrates in his discussion of the Thebaid,^ the Fury is the key figure in Statius' 'allegorisation' of the supernatural apparatus, but Roman epicists had long placed Furies in the company of less concrete personifications.50) This both assists and reflects their rehabilitation in Roman literature from mythical figures into personified abstractions. The Furiae have a great deal in common with strongly anthropomorphised abstractions (for example, Virgil's Allecto disguises herself as the mortal Calybe, just as his Somnus impersonates Phorbas), but in their case, Roman culture made concrete deities (the Greek Erinyes, also known as Eumen ides, Enyo, etc.) more abstract, rather than the reverse. The proper names Tisiphone, Megaera and Allecto indicate this concreteness, which Ovid employs to blur the distinction further by coining the names Morpheus, Icelos/Phobetor and Phantasos (Metamorphoses 11.633-45). The Furiae in the Augustan epics (Virgil's Allecto and Ovid's Tisiphone) are the source from which the strongly anthropomorphised personifications in these texts gain their new ambiguity as compositional allegories. They lend both their physical characteristics and their ontological ambiguity to Fama, Somnus, Invidia and Fames, and thus enable new developments in personification allegory in the late first century BC. 3. Fama and Somnus in the Aeneid Virgil's two major personified abstractions both make Fury-like interven tions, yet they represent contrasting types of imaginative syllepsis, both of which influence Ovid. Fama has attracted more critical attention than any 49) Feeney 1993, esp. 337-64. 50) Yirgil pUts Eumenides near the twelve personifications at the entrance to the underworld {A. 6.280). Ovid's Tisiphone uses a cauldron whose ingredients are a cocktail of concrete (if not strictly 'personified') abstractions such as errores and amor caedis, as well as more literal ingredients such as Cerberus-spittle and Echidna-venom. According to Valerius Flac cus, the beneficiaries of the invention of iron were Odia, Lrae and the Erinys (5.145-6), whilst Jason battles Absyrtus accompanied by Pallas, mala leti Gaudia, Tisiphone, and Fuga (5.173-81). In Eumolpus' recitation of civil war epic, Erinys, Megaera and Furor emerge from Erebus in the company of Letum, Lnsidiae and Mors (Petr. 124). Seen as a forerunner to Prudentius' Psychomachia, this text provides a continuous tradition leading into the enormously extensive moral allegories of the Middle Ages.</page><page sequence="12">D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 425 other personified abstraction in ancient literature.51) Critics have drawn attention to her birdlike features, chthonic provenance, disruptive role, and of course feminine gender, which place her in parallel with Allecto in Book 7. Her ontological status cannot be properly fixed. Her body is impossible to visualise, precisely because it is described so concretely, as a mass of feathers, ears and eyes (Aeneid 4.175-83). She operates in the human world by going from city to city' (it Fama per urbes, 4.173), but without actually being seen or spoken to, i.e. she is not anthropomor phised to the level of interaction with humans. Somnus is at the other extreme of materiality, yet also very like Allecto. He has a physical form that not only is human-like but draws on well-established iconographie conventions.52) He is endowed with direct speech, engaging in conversa tion with one human while disguised as another (the disguise is seen through, as when Allecto speaks with Turnus). Ovid's versions of Fama and Somnus rework Virgil and increase the range of possibility for the depiction of personified abstractions: the Ovidian Fama diverges widely from Virgil's in her domain and behaviour, though her dwelling-place has a hundred doors, like Virgil's underworld, which repeats the associations of multiplicity and chthonic provenance. Likewise, Ovid's Somnus becomes slothfully medio-passive.53) Allecto inspires continued elaboration in the personifications of early Imperial epic. 4. Invidia The location, behaviour and personality of Ovid's Invidia in Metamorpho ses 2 symbolise the various attributes and symptoms of envy in Roman thought. Invidia is associated with the colour black; disease-like symptoms of wasting and putrefaction; coldness, as a metaphor for sluggishness or inertia; and above all with the evil eye, the sidelong glance of the grudge 51) E.g.

Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 bearer.54) In a rich iconographie tradition of the apotropaic phthoneros or invidiosus, as in Ovid, medio-passivity is the mode of operation: the envi ous person both inflicts suffering on himself as a side-effect, and has his own malice rebound upon them.55) All of these concepts are acknowledged in the scene, but looking askance especially is a major theme, as the follow ing examples, noted by Feeney, illustrate: Invidia never looks straight (776) and watches Minerva leave with a sidelong glance (787); Aglauros is said to look both in Minerva's basket and at Mercury visiting her sister, with the same wayward eyes (740, 748-9); and even Minerva looks grudgingly at Aglauros (752-9), sighs, and can't look straight at Invidia (768-70).56) Aglauros numbers among the poem's many 'poetic justice' metamorphoses, whereby a transformation-victim's new form literalises their formerly metaphorical characteristics (famously, savage Lycaon as a wolf or weeping Niobe as a spring), in two stages. First, Minerva chooses Invidia to punish Aglauros' ungenerous selfishness. Second, she is ulti mately choked by fossilisation (choking being a symptom of envy) and turned by Mercury into an inert and black-stained statue.57) Aglauros' transformations take her from example, to embodiment, to symbol of envy. Invidids medio-passivity, i.e. self-replication, precedes the actual p?trification. This suggests that the 'transforming' effect of the personi fication facilitates the metamorphosis effected by the god. The relationship between the two is almost symbiotic. The Invidia episode is a vehicle for humorous exaggeration and parody, like that of Athamas, Ino and Tisiphone. Invidia seizes a stick wound all over with prickly brambles (an anti-caduceus, or perhaps anti-thyrsus), and travels covered up with black clouds, parodying traditional epic attri butes of other divinities. Ovid employs the tropes of love-elegy as Aglauros is punished for making life difficult for Mercury the lover: attempting to extract money from him, coming close to betraying him to their father, blocking the door to his girlfriend's house?in short, playing characters that the elegiac lover detests. Applying a cocktail of semi-metaphorical toxins, foreshadowing Tisiphone's later in the poem, Invidia spreads pitch 54) For a detailed analysis see Dickie 1975. 55) For a critical survey of the material evidence see Dunbabin &amp; Dickie 1983, esp. 9. 56) Feeney 1991, 246. 57) Ov.

There is rubigo both on Invidia s teeth and around Fames mouth (2.776, 8.802), since this all-purpose word for mould, rust or any other corrupting stain (includ ing grain-rot, a cause of famine and thus an auxiliary nemesis of Ceres)59) can also mean 'ill-will'.60) Ovid's story o? Invidia being visited upon Aglau ros may even have been inspired by the fact that Fames victim Erysichthon is actually her brother: their mother is also called Aglauros.61) Like Ovid's other major personifications, Invidia and Fames share characteristics with one another, but above all with Virgil's Allecto and Ovid's Tisiphone. Dishevelledness, burning pitch, and unbearable, incurable effects are Furial qualities. The ambiguous status of the Furies, in their transition from Greek interpretative allegory to Roman compositional allegory, provided a fundamental model for both Virgil and Ovid in their seminal contribu tions to the evolution of personification allegory in literature. 5. Fames The story of Erysichthon and his punishment is told in Callimachus' Hymn to Demeter (31-117), but Ovid's version replaces its non-personified (and of course masculine) ?ijliO? with a far more vivid entity.62) To take the sec ond half of the story first, the effects of Fames on Erysichthon are not the same as those of Callimachus' Aiuo?. The latter causes the prince to waste away to bones and sinews, and finally reduces him, after eating the horses and the cat, to begging for leftovers at the crossroads.63) In Ovid, the con 58) For a detailed study see Rosenmeyer 1999. 59) Hollis 1970, 141 on Met. 8.802. 60) Rubigo as metaphor for malevolence: Petr. 124; Stat.

Ovid's Aglauros is also Cecrops' daughter: Ov. Met. 2.784-5. 62) Aifio? was portrayed as female in a painting in the Spartan temple of Apollo (Callis thenes, FrGH 124 F 13) which, as de Velasco (1988, 288) notes, is probably because Aiuo? is feminine in Doric. 63) Call.

Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 vention of medio-passivity is reversed, as Erysichthon is transformed not into a starveling but an energetic (and apparently quite healthy) glutton, in contrast to the famished Fames herself. There is emphasis on images of emptiness and effort in vain, particularly in the first moments of the onset of Fames when, like Aglauros, Erysichthons desire is provoked by false dreams: he 'works his empty mouth and wears tooth upon tooth, his deluded throat swallows intangible food, and he fruitlessly guzzles thin air instead of dinner' (8.825-7). Although his eventual fate of eating himself out of existence is the ultimate condensation of an individual down to a "hieroglyphic emblem of hunger",64) this is one place where we should oe careful to separate out the physiological from the psychological: Erysich thons supposed gravis morbus (839) is not malnutrition, with its physical symptoms of wasting and ill-health, but appetite. Besides frenzy, Erysich thon appears not to experience any negative emotional effects. This is the core of the episode's many oxymoronic oppositions between excess and nothingness. It contrasts the gargantuan consumption of the exemplum with the malnutrition of the abstraction. The reader is presented with numerous forms of lack whose appearances are quite the opposite: Erysi chthon dreams he is eating, but swallows empty air; when he wakes, he eats food that would be enough for whole cities and populations, but isn't enough for one man; and when he eats himself, he nourishes his body by reducing it {minuendo corpus alebat, 878). Ovid's typical relish for contriv ing paradoxical statements comes through in the Invidia episode also: for example, that spiteful figure grieves at the satisfaction Minerva will derive from her own success (2.787-8), and cannot restrain her tears when she reaches the palace, because there is nothing there to cry about (2.796). Here, Ovid generates a series of oxymoronic phrases and concepts out of the basic idea of someone becoming hungrier by eating. Even in the first half of the episode, Fames herself is in some ways the antithesis of what her victim will become. She inhabits Scythia along with sluggish Cold (Frigus iners, 790), while Erysichthons hunger will be like a raging fire (837-9), also described zsflammae (846). She is found scrabbling at sparse plants in a stony field with her nails and teeth (799-800), an image of poverty and malnutrition as opposed to his lavish consumption. Yet she, as Erysichthon &lt;*&gt; Skulskyl981,36.</page><page sequence="16">D.M. Lowe ? Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 429 will, incarnates the disguised lack. Her hollowed-out body itself seems to be other than it is: her skin is see-through (803), she has the place for a belly instead of a belly (805), her breastbone seems only to be supported by her spine, as if her ribcage was hollow (805-6), and her knees, ankles and other joints seem big and bulging (807-8), though of course their relative thickness to her unmuscled bones is the reason for this.65) Yet the existence of contrasts, as well as similarities, between the figures o? Fames and her victim suggest that Allecto-style personification allegories do not merely turn their human targets into replicas of themselves, but enjoy some kind of independence from the effects they create. As Hardie argues, the fact that the effects of these semi-metaphorical entities always take the form of some kind of illusion represents both their blurred status, and the fictionality of the poem itself.66) Just as Ovid's four strongly anthropomorphised personifications, Invidia, Fames, Somnus and Fama, all inhabit houses (domos),G7) they are all linked by distorted perception: sidelong glances; feasting on nothing in a dream; exaggerated rumours; and believing in a false dream. In these respects they prove themselves descendants of Virgil's Fama and Somnus, both deceptive impersonators, and above all of Allecto, a third impersonator roused from her infernal sedes (Aeneid 7325). Ovid's Tisiphone, in a description suitably domestic for a figure first seen sitting with her sisters combing her hair (Metamor phoses 4.453-4), picks up her torch, dons her robe and belts it with a snake before leaving the house (egrediturque domo, 4.484). Her function is of course, like Allecto's, to instill violent delusions. Leaving home to perpe trate delusion and then returning (or, in the case of Ovid's Fama, simply staying there throughout) is Furial behaviour. This betrays the centrality of the Furies to this phase of development in the role of personification alle gory in Roman literature, foreshadowing Statius' Thebaid. 65) Cf. Hesiod's 'A%?/u? {Se. 264-5). According to the visual record, skeletal figures seem to have held some aesthetic interest in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There is a famous pair of cups from Bosco reale depicting skeletons at a banquet (Hinks 1939, 122), and a statuette of an emaciated youth from the mid first century BC to the mid first century AD (Garland 1995, 118-9). 66) Hardie 1999, 96; 2002, 234. 67) Ov.

Somnus The episode featuring Somnus in Metamorphoses 11, the story of Ceyx and Alcyone, explores the ontological complications of developing personifi cation allegory to a Furial degree by repeatedly enacting illusion and disil lusion: finally, through the figure of Alcyone, it calls into question the interpretative abilities of the allegorical reader. There is common ground with the other personifications: like Invidia, Somnus lives somewhere that the sun never shines, and is strongly associated with the colour black.68) Like the Oread sent to Fames by Ceres, the messenger (this time Iris, her self to some extent the personification of the rainbow) experiences the effect of the abstraction and hastily flies south again. Somnus had in fact collaborated in the activities of Fames (8.823-4, 'gentle Sleep was still stroking Erysichthon with his calm wings'). This time, the motifs of con tradiction previously seen in Ovid's accounts o? Fames and Invidia concern the contrast between reality and what the gullible believe. The dupe is Alcyone, who prays incessantly at Juno's altar for Ceyx' return, unaware that he has drowned. Information is transmitted along a chain of interpre tation: Juno causes Iris to cause Somnus to cause an apparition of Ceyx to cause Alcyone to infer the truth. The means to this truth is, however, highly deceptive, and before it reaches Alcyone herself, the buck has passed from Juno (who, as a goddess, is 'personified' by metonymy) to increasingly abstract figures, finishing with a personification whose very function is to seem other than he is. Somnus selects Morpheus from among his (etymo logical) offspring, the countless Somnia (Dreams), to impersonate Ceyx. Morpheus, putting aside the wings which the sleep-god often has,69) chal lenges Alcyone to 'recognise' him as Ceyx. Morpheus speech is full of irony; he claims to be bringing the message of his death in person rather than by messenger. He calls himself not her husband but her husband's shade (11.660), a half-truth which she believes, though she nonetheless tries to embrace him and catches only the air (674-5). Furthermore, he tells her not to promise him to herself in vain?which is precisely what she is doing, in speaking to 'Ceyx' at all. The ironies of Morpheus' speech may understandably be lost on Alcyone, but, though she claims to, she seems 68) Hypnos was black-coloured (in contrast to white Thanatos) in archaic Greek art (Bazant 1997, 644). 69) E.g.

Despite having been told that she had seen Ceyx' shade, she looks for him when she wakes up (678-9) and even checks for his soggy footprints (693). When she does acknowl edge that it seemed to be his shade, she says that his face was not the same as usual, but still it was a good likeness {manifesta virique I vera mei, 688-9). Alcyone's naivety reaches the extreme of irony when she goes to the shore the next day, sees her own husband's corpse bobbing into view: before being able to recognise it she expresses sympathy for the dead man, who ever he is?and his wife (720-1). After seeing Alcyone get misled in so many ways by Morpheus, the personification of metz-morph-oses, the reader is set up for his or her own interpretation problem. When Alcyone is turned into a bird,70) and kisses Ceyx' face, we are told: senserit hoc Ceyx, an vultum motibus undae tollere sit visus, populus dubitabat, at ille senserat (11.739-41) 'Whether Ceyx felt this, or whether he (merely) seemed to lift his face from the motion of the water, the people were in doubt; but he did feel it.' Alcyone first believed her husband was alive when he wasn't, then believed he was either alive or a shade when he was merely a (false) dream, and finally, when he did appear, believed he was someone else. The reader is now asked to decide whether to believe Ovid when he tells us that this time, Ceyx was really himself. This problem of illusion and inconsistent perspectives was foreshadowed in the scene where Somnus appears. For one thing, the dream known to the gods as Icelos, 'the Resembler', is called by mortals Phobetor, 'the Frightener' (640-1), suggesting two very different perspectives.7^ In general, the cave of Somnus itself is an interpretative 70) Ceyx and Alcyone become the ceyx and alcyon, grammatically masculine and feminine sea-birds. 71) Archaic Greek poetry features several instances of the gods calling something by one name, mortals another: //. 1.401-5 (the Titan Briareus/Aegaeon); 2.813-4 (a mound near Troy, 'Tomb of MyrineVBatieia); 14.289-91 ("Ytcvo? imitates a mountain bird, chalcisl cymindis); 20.72-4 (the river Xanthus/Scamander). Hesiod's Typhoeus utters various kinds of noise, some of which is intelligible to the gods (Th. 829-35). Pherecydes supposedly claimed that the divine word for 'table' was Otxopo? (D.L. 1.119).</page><page sequence="19">432 D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 vacuum, a space devoid of evaluation or commentary. There is no source of noise to break the silence; Lethe's oblivion-inducing waters well up from the depths; the dreams which populate it are countless, empty, and shape shifting; and Sleep can only be roused 'from himself (sibi se, 621) long enough to pick out Morpheus before wilting back onto his bed. As Feeney suggests, the self-contained nature of the state of sleep may be what causes the personification, and the episode as a whole, to be self-contained.72) Yet whatever the reason, Somnus and the dreams are as intangible and illusory as Morpheus himself. Somnus, the core of the scene, is an undefined and uncertain character. His passivity, inertia, murky colouring, unspecified appearance, lack of direct speech, and the fact that he acts only by delega tion, make him the personification of anonymity and featurelessness.73) Morpheus and the other somnia vana with which he is surrounded appear to have forms and identities, but are indeed the sons of Somnus in their elusive lack of substance. Somnus regains his Virgilian powers of indepen dent action and verbal address as an emissary-personification to Hannibal from Jupiter in Silius Italicus' Punica (10.340-71), but Ovid's Somnus-epi sode challenges interpretation on a more ambitious level than Ovid's three emissary-personifications Invidia, Fames and Fama. Alcyone, weeping at the vision of Ceyx, stretches out her arms per somnum (11.675) and shakes off sopor (677-8), though for once Ovid uncharacteristically avoids this opportunity for abstraction-based word games or double meanings, thereby frustrating a thoroughgoing allegorical scheme. Somnus is even further dis tanced from his target than Fames', his effect breaks the medio-passive prec edent (Alcyone is agitated, not sedated), and comes from Morpheus, a third party entirely. The featureless Somnus and his innumerable feature-shifting dreams, even more than Invidia and Fames earlier in the text, threaten to betray their own illusory fictionality. Somnus himself plays a minimal role, his shyness symbolising the irretrievable loss of straight personification (as in Homer) in exchange for self-conscious fictions. In this episode, the function of the personification as a motivating character in the plot, for which both Virgil's Allecto and Fama are models, has become disposable and incidental. Ovid's Fama in the subsequent book takes the movement 72) Feeney 1991, 243. 73) Cf. Hardie 2002, 232: "he represents the nightly reduction in sleep of an individual to a non-person".</page><page sequence="20">D.M. Lowe I Mnemosyne 61 (2008) 414-435 433 to its conclusion, being purely parenthetical. Ovid's extended personifica tions enact a transition away from concreteness into abstraction as Invidia, Fames, Somnus and Fama move progressively further away from the human world, off to the underworld-like symbolic spaces they inhabit and to which, in a sense, they truly belong, the kindred of Allecto and Tisiphone. Virgil's and Ovid's personification allegories are designed for an audi ence that can recognise and relish movements and contrasts between the literal and allegorical (i.e. supernatural and metaphorical) domains, which developed as corollaries to the transformation of the Furia. This would make personifications such an essential part of the genre that, by amassing a crowd of abstractions, the epic recited by Petronius' Eumolpus travesties Roman epic style. Literary experimentation with the bizarre implications of personified abstractions in the first century BC may be related to the contemporary lull in the establishment of new abstraction cults, before their imperial revival.74) The same century sees the first use of the term allegoria to mean not merely 'compositional allegory' but 'interpretative allegory' as well. Roman authors such as Ovid and Virgil bring out the potential for complexity, even downright absurdity, of allegorical composi tion, by employing it against allegorical interpretation. The visualisation resistant body of Virgil's Fama is an extravagantly grotesque agglomeration like the poisonous contents of Tisiphone's cauldron in Metamorphoses 4.500-5. These images, and the Augustan personified abstractions as a whole, confront the allegorist with awkward puzzles. Roman allegorical composition, as developed by Ovid and Virgil, celebrates the ontological ambiguities of literary personifications, inspired by the role of the Fury in Roman poetry and in their own epics.
