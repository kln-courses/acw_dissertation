The aim of this methodology is to study such remains after evaluating the significance of taphonomic processes, such as the degree of fragmentation, cause of fragmentation, overrepresentation of certain taxa, processes of erosion, transport and deposition, and combustion intensity. Atten tion is also paid to the fragmentation of the caryopses prior to charring, and a new method is presented for the calcu lation of the minimum numbers of individuals (MNI) of cereal caryopses. This methodology requires a seed-by seed description in order to obtain fully quantified data of taphonomic importance, which is therefore time consum ing, but at the same time achieves precise information of great value for the evaluation of the assemblage. Our case study has been the remains found in Layer 18 at the archaeological cave site of Can Sadurnf (Begues, Barce lona province, Spain), one of the most important early Neolithic cereal assemblages on the Iberian Peninsula.

Thus, before any analysis of an assemblage takes place, it is necessary to evaluate the degree of influence of these processes (Schiffer 1983). Schiffer's statements have not had the same scientific consequences in the analysis of all the archaeological record. Seed assemblages are part of this record and their formation processes have to be analysed not only by the context in which they appear but also by the description of the state of their properties. At the moment, there are some papers in press where Schiffer's definition of the properties of the archaeological record has been adapted to seed records (Antolfn in press a), and also about the relation of each property to the formation processes (Antolfn in press b), but we will not be dealing with these aspects in this paper. Here, we will propose a systematic method for the description of caryopsis remains in order to demonstrate the potential of seeds themselves in tapho nomical analysis, and the importance of this analysis for the interpretation of seed assemblages. The proposal which we present in this paper aims to cover two essential aspects for evaluating the economic significance of carpological (seed and fruit) remains. We look, on the one hand, at the taphonomic aspects such as the intensity of the charring processes or the existence of post-depositional transport and erosive processes, and on the other hand, at economic aspects such as the detection of processing practices, like dehusking or fracturing of the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="2">54 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2011) 20:53-66 cereal. The fragmentation of the seed remains or their state of preservation has occasionally been dealt with in ar chaeobotanical studies (Valamoti 2002; Bouby et al. 2005; Alonso et al. 2007; Alonso 2008), although normally only noting the appearance of certain characters of remains and not applying a seed-by-seed analysis, except for Bouby et al. (2005). Likewise, there are experimental studies on the charring of cereals (Braadbaart 2008) or olives (Mar garitis and Jones 2008) that, while they have not concen trated solely on the biométrie changes, have not focused on obtaining appearance patterns for the different observable characteristics such as the popping of the endosperm and concavisation of the seed sides, etc., which on the other hand, are noted in some of the cited studies. An attempt at quantifying these aspects is found in Hubbard and al Azm (1990), but we believe that some of them must still be analyzed only at a qualitative level, since there is no complete and systematic experimental work that allows their quantification. Our proposal also aims to be quantitative, but with clear limitations because of the state of development of the research. In order to show the value of this methodology, we have applied it to an exceptional archaeological assemblage, the concentration of cereal grains from Layer 18 at the cave of Can Sadurni (Begues, Barcelona province, Spain), which consists of more than 60,000 remains from what has been interpreted as a funerary deposit from the beginning of the early Neolithic (ca. 5400 cal yrs b.c.). Materials and methods Taphonomic study and description of the cereal remains In order to arrange the description of the cereal remains we have designed a database on an Excel spreadsheet in which each item corresponds to a line, and each column is a variable in its analysis. We chose this system because of the simplicity of working with this program and also because of the possibilities it allows for working with the data both in Excel and for transferring it to other programs for statistical analysis. In the following, we will present the variables that we are using and show how these are recorded in the database. Some of the categories are filled in using text and others with numbers. The abbreviations can be changed and adapted to the language of the data base, providing that the same ones are used consistently and the concepts with which they are associated are well defined. When the categories are filled in with numerical characters, they have a nominal value (1 = "yes", 0 = "no"). The variables we have taken into consideration are as follows: inventory number, archaeological site, year of excavation, location, chronology, structure or layer, strati graphie unit or square, number of processed litres of soil, sieve mesh size, location reference in the store, taxon, part represented, number of remains, type of preservation, fragmented part, state of preservation of the pericarp, type of fragmentation, shiny surface, adherence of the embryo, germinated embryo, combustion effects, insect holes, length, width and thickness (Antoh'n 2008). Below, one can find a more detailed description of some of the variables. Part represented Type of remains: caryopsis, glume base, glume fragment, spikelet fork, etc. In addition, in the case of cereal cary opses, for which this aspect has been more widely studied, we can distinguish between two types of fragmentation (Bouby et al. 2005): - Fragmentation which occurred prior to charring: detected by the type of section: bulging (Knörzer 1981; Valamoti 2002). This fragmentation can be caused accidentally during the processing of the cereal or intentionally during culinary preparation. - Fragmentation caused after charring: the fragmentation can occur at various times after charring: from tram pling, sedimentary pressure, erosion, the excavation process during recovery and processing of the samples, etc. (Schiffer 1983; Antolln in press b). Preservation type The way in which the remains have been preserved: by charring, mineralisation, waterlogging or desiccation. Fragmented part In the case of a cereal caryopsis fragment, the preserved part of the grain is specified using the nomenclature shown in Fig. 1.

Despite the fact that we do not know what causes this, for example incomplete charring and intact: absence of signs of erosion eventual loosening of the embryo, boiling of the seeds semi-intact: occasional signs of erosion or other causes, we believe that after further experi semi-degraded: significant signs of erosion ments it will probably be of significant social and degraded: general erosion economic meaning. over-degraded: complete loss of the pericarp and the - Embryo germination: the detection of germinated testa grains allows us to suggest intentional germination practices that were necessary for making fermented Type of fragmentation drinks or for storage practices.

However, this type of counting has sev Thus, it has been considered necessary to record the eral drawbacks: on the one hand, no distinction is made in following variables (based on Braadbaart 2008). Each publications between whole caryopses and fragments, since considered variable has a column assigned to it in our fragments with embryos are recorded along with complete Excel table and its presence or absence is indicated caryopses, which means that part of the basic taphonomic numerically, as we explained above. information is not specified; secondly, the rest of the fragments are not taken into account in the subsequent data handling, which means they are not included in the general interpretation of the assemblage; and finally, as a conse quence, it provides a smaller or equal minimum number of individuals to that which would be obtained by taking into account all the fragments. This method is therefore unsuitable for the accurate description that our questions posed about the assemblage of Can Sadurni. Yet, it must be clarified that Jones's system is absolutely appropriate for daily archaeobotanical work, since it is fast and uncomplicated. We therefore propose here an exclusive counting system for cereals that is not only more exact but—above all—also allows taphonomic interpretations to be carried out. In order to make the calculation, we need to take into account the different possible types of fragmentation described above (Fig. 1). The number of whole caryopses is added to the highest number of the transversal fragments, consid ering that a seed cannot generate more than one of each, to the highest number of the longitudinal fragments (longi tudinal dorsal and longitudinal ventral), for the same reason mentioned above, and to them we add the number of lon gitudinal ventral-dorsal fragments divided by two, as each grain can give rise to two longitudinal ventral-dorsal fragments (Antoh'n 2008; Antolin and Alonso 2009; An tolfn et al. in press b). We believe this system makes up for the deficiencies of the other techniques. Below, our results are compared to the ones that would have been obtained with Jones's system. Numerical description: a proposal for counting For the analysis of the results we will not be using any the minimum number of individuals (MNI) system of numerical description or data standardisation that has not been explained or discussed by other authors There are two basic methods of counting the number of (Hastorf 1988; Miller 1988; Popper 1988, among others), individuals from cereal caryopses (Hillman et al. 1996). One is based only on the identification and counting of The case study: the seed assemblage of the cave whole grains, assuming that they are present at the same of Can Sadurnf relative percentages as those of fragments. This system is of no use for a taphonomic approach such as ours, since The cave of Can Sadurni is on the side of a small hill in the there are several agents that are detected by the degree and calcareous massif of the Serra de Garraf, overlooking the type of fragmentation per taxon. It should only be used, fertile plain of Begues (Barcelona province, Catalonia, then, when whole seeds are representative of the complete Spain; Fig. 3). During the excavations carried out in the assemblage and when it is obvious that there has not been cave over the last 30 years, up to 21 different archaeo any kind of erosion, transport or deposition of the remains, logical strata have been identified, with a chronology going for example when a charred grain store is found in situ, from approximately 11000 cal yrs b.c. up to the last cen with an intact container protecting it. The second method is tury (Blasco 1993; Blasco et al. 1983, 1999, 2005a, b; Edo Ô Springer Popped grains/protrusions (Fig. 2c): these usually appear in experiments heating cereals at temperatures of over 250°C, when the heating rates in °C/min are high (Braadbaart 2008). We differentiate between popped grains, a concept that defines the expansion of the endosperm of the grain, generating characteristic longitudinal striations but without allowing the endo carp substances to come out, and protrusions, a concept used to designate the visible popping of endosperm material out of the pericarp. Aggregated grains: grains forming clumps (Fig. 2b), adhered to each other (Bouby et al. 2005). Adhered particles: adherence of organic or mineral particles to the pericarp of the caryopses as a conse quence of charring. Grain still attached to the spikelet or the chaff: this indicates, first, the absence and or inefficiency of dehusking and, secondly, exceptional charring conditions. Concave sides: experimental studies associate this with the high temperatures reached, as well as high heating rates. Pressure deformation: this deformation is characteristic of seed assemblages burnt in confined space inside containers; it leads the grains to deform each other due to swelling as the temperature rises. Total deformation of the grain: associated with high heating rates.</page><page sequence="5">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2011) 20:53-66 57 Fig. 3 Ground plan and location of the cave of Can Sadurni in the setting of the Massis del Garraf in Catalonia (Spain), with the area of the 1 x 4 m test trench delimited et al. 1986; Antoh'n 2008).

Such questions, that we have now presented in very simplistic terms, and many others, should be our main aims of future research in order to understand both the conditions that created the studied assemblages as we recover them and their representativity. The proposed methodology increases the possibilities for describing seed assemblages and, in short, brings us a more detailed knowledge of our subject of study, as well as allowing us to make interesting economic interpretations of the results. Thus, seed-by-seed description has to be done if we want to evaluate not only the presence of some taph onomic factors but also their intensity, which is absolutely essential so as to be able to state the representativity of an assemblage.
