In this second article of the series the author discusses some features of Rehmke's Lehrbuch der ailgemreinen Psycho/ogie. The chief points of attack are Rehmke's explanation of change and his attempt to make the soul individual, but not a thing. Rehmke tries to explain change in things by his concept of Augenblickseinheiten, which are themselves unchange- able. This reduces the individual to the purely conceptual relation of genus and species, and takes us out of the realm of experience into that of speculation. It is no easier to explain change in the soul, for the subjective element whereby the Seelen-Konkreles is distinguished from the Dingeinheit is itself unchangeable, but is supposed in some mysterious way to produce change. Rehmke seeks to establish the individuality of the soul, and at the same time to avoid the error of making the soul a thing. The differ- ence between the Dingeinheit and the Seelen-Konkretes seems to be that the subjective element is present in the latter and not in the former. But the individual consciousness is individual, as distinguished from the univer- sal consciousness, only by being in time and space. Hence the See/en- Konkretes is only another form of the See/en-Ding which Rehmke has tried to avoid. - After discussing these two main points, the author offers objections to Rehmke's theories of pleasantness and unpleasantness, of will and of space, and to his position with regard to psycho-physical parallelism. The point of view from which all the criticisms are made is that of opposi- tion to the spiritualistic tendencies of psychology. ELLEN B. TALBOT. Le sommeil et la drtebration inconsciente durant le sommeil. L. DUGAS. Rev. Ph., XXII, 4, pp. 410-421. Sleep and waking are not distinct groups of psychic processes. The two conditions are contiguous in time, and one is often taken by the subject for</page><page sequence="2">552 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. the other. They are so far from being incompatible that they are sometimes simultaneous. Thus a mother in the deepest sleep may be awake to every sound from her infant. The truest sleep is unconscious, but the difference between waking and dreaming or conscious sleep is simply that between active and passive attention. The dream is the automatic functioning of the mind. The activities of the higher cerebral centres and the higher intel- lectual operations are impaired or suspended. The dreamer apprehends his mental states, but as a rule cannot control or compare them, cannot judge or reason. The dream is psychic anarchy, affective and intellectual. Absurdity is not, however, its distinctive characteristic, for any mental operation which has become habitual may be continued mechanically during sleep. This fact partially explains the extraordinary stories of mental tasks performed in sleep. As to reports of lessons learned in sleep, we should notice that the moment when one falls asleep is peculiarly favorable to an act of memoriz- ing on account of the absence of distractions from without, and that the moment when one wakes with recuperated brain is equally favorable to the recall of the memories so formed. If, however, an invention is always pro- duced par Pheureux instinct d'une teate bien faite, it is comprehensible that sleep, which suspends reflection and restores to the mind its native or acquired spontaneity, should precipitate discoveries of profound thinkers. ELEANOR A. M. GAMBLE. Sur les transformations de nos images mentales. JEAN PHILIPPE. Rev. Ph., XXII, 5, pp. 481-493. The writer presents the results of some observations and experiments on the transformations which certain mental images, commonly considered exact and permanent memories, undergo without our knowledge. His method was suggested by M. Flournoy of Geneva. The experiment, in its most important features, is as follows. The subject, with closed eyes, handles a small object, familiar, or at least not unknown to him, in such a way as to obtain a visual image of it. This image he is made to draw im- mediately, and at successive intervals of from fifteen to twenty days, and then at intervals of one or two months or more. Each time he supposes that the demand will never be repeated. A comparison of the series of images obtained from each subject shows that the transformations suffered by such images are of at least three types. (i) The image may disappear, either by elimination or by confusion of its details, so utterly that the sub- ject is not able to indicate it even verbally. This obliteration is likely to occur when the image is vague from the first. (2) By the substitution of other details for those of its original form, the image may alter its form entirely, or (3) may conform more and more to the general type of the group to which it belongs. This third sort of transformation is the most common in adults, for in all normal mental life, by a constant application of the law of economy, useless details disappear to make room for that which is necessary to the whole. ELEANOR A. M. GAMBLE.</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 553 The Psychology of Humian Progress. HELEN BOSANQUET. Int. J. E., VII, 3, pp. 265-281. This article is an application of a few psychological conceptions to certain problems in sociology. The difficulty arising from the lack of progressive wants in some men is explained psychologically as a lack of disturbance of the mental equilibrium. The remedy is found in compelling both children and grown persons to struggle mentally in solving their own life problems. When means to ends are discovered, mental stability is renewed. The law is that the more mental equilibrium is disturbed, the more exposed it is to fresh disturbances. Hence every new interest multiplies interests, and the danger of becoming automatic at a low stage of development is diminished. Mr. Stout's theory of noetic synthesis when applied to sociology means (I) that the new cannot be assimilated unless the mind is prepared to receive it; (2) that society is held together by the presence, in its individuals, of similar affections, tendencies to gregariousness, and reasoning powers; (3) that the higher the stage of development, the more definitely organized is the reasoning process of the individual minds and the society constructed by those minds. The individual is governed in his reasoning by the idea of the whole matter under consideration rather than by the special idea last emerging. Children and the poor should be taught to find means to ends. The incentive to action should be neither fear of punishment nor hope of reward apart from the consequences of the action itself. It should be interest in definite ends and the means leading to ends as organic parts of life. MARY G. ALLEN. Einig,-e Experimente jiber Gesichisbilder im Traurn. J. M. VOLD. Z. f. Ps. u. Phys. d. Sinn., XIII, I, 2, pp. 66-74. A small object was fixated for a few minutes by the subject immedi- ately before sleeping at night. The following morning the dream of the night was recorded. Some 300 experiments were made upon people of various ages and occupations. It was found that the color, form, and size of the object often appeared in the dream. Sometimes a complementary color appeared. The qualities of the object appeared in new combinations, and often elements from previous experiences were intermingled. The author concludes that the visual apparatus reproduces just before awakening the conditions of the previous evening. The fact that elements from daily experience and from the special presentation of the evening unite in various new syntheses, he explains by independent functioning of the various brain cells involved in perception.

[VOL. VI. that in which one comes to understand written language. According to prevailing methods, reading and writing are taught together ; but it will be convenient to consider reading first. In the understanding of written language, three processes are united: (i) cognition of the visual forms, (2) understanding of their sound values, (3) understanding of the meaning. The cognition of visual forms is considered first. We assume, for con- venience, that the child begins with the study of the separate letters. He soon learns to recognize each as a visual whole. It is also, ordinarily, a simultaneous whole for him, i.e., its essential parts are recognized without eye-movement. This recognition, however, does not depend wholly on the given visual stimulus, but may be partly due to previous stimuli. Those components of the new stimulus which are like (gleichartig) elements of an earlier stimulus produced by the same letter tend to call up these residual elements. The result is an attfercettive, as distinguished from anl associ- ative, fusion. This apperceptive fusion is of great service in helping the child to recognize the different letters readily. After the letters have become familiar, the child soon begins to recognize words as wholes. Apper- ceptive visual supplementing is of assistance here. Often, without eye- movement, only a part of the word can be clearly seen, and yet this part is sufficient for recognition. It cannot be proved directly that such supple- menting takes place, but the results of psychological experiment make it practically certain. The amount of attention which children have to give to the letters and words explains, in part at least, the fact that they so often read without really grasping the meaning. When the characters and words have become more familiar, the attention paid to them and to the acoustic images of the sounds represented by them becomes less, as the attention given to the thought becomes greater. The strength of the visual memory is an important factor in reading. The rest of the article is occupied with anl account of an interesting case of verbal-visual memory. ELLEN B. TALBOT. Was ehirt der ILL Internationale Psychologen-Kongress in Miinc/en? R. WITLLY. V. f. w. Ph., XXI, I, PP. 97-1o6. This article is a protest against certain features of the recent Psychologi- cal Congress. The two main criticisms are (i) that ' psychology ' was made to include many other branches of science; and (2) that the influence of a spiritualistic philosophy was evident in the case of many of the speakers. In this connection, Stumpf's Opiening Address and Lipps' Conccejt of the Unconscious in Psychology are severely criticized. ELLEN B. TALBOT. Lapsicologia dleisentimenti. G. VILLA. R. I. d. Fil., XI, 2, pp. 253-295. This article is a discussion of recent publications on the feelings, and especially of Rtihot's work La fisychologie des sentiments. The writer</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 555 divides theories in regard to the feelings into intellectualism and volitional- ism. The intellectualist school in Germany is represented by the Herbar- tians, who derive feelings from the harmony and contrasts of representations. In contradiction to this is the view of Schopenhauer and his followers, which regards the inner complex of impulses, desires, and feelings that constitutes the will to be the sole moving force, the intellect as such being passive. Ribot, however, divides the prevailing theories into the intellectualist -according to which the affective states are secondary or derived qualities or modes of cognition - and the physiological, which correlates all affective states with biological conditions, and regards them as the direct expression of the vegetative life; and himself adopts the latter. This division, however, does not take account of the modified form of volitionalism upheld by Wundt, Paulsen, Hbffding, and other writers. Ribot tends to treat feelings as having no importance except as signs of the state of the organism, failing to recognize that the ultimate object of psychological investigation must be a psychological fact. The theory of the emotions held by James, Lange, and in substance by Ribot, is criticised as leading to the conclusion pointed out by Wundt of excluding from the feelings those unaccompanied by physical expression. According to Ribot, feeling is not merely separable from, but even in opposition to cognition, so that the intellectual life grows at the expense of the life of feeling. But the existence and strength of the intel- lectual feelings disprove this; all great men of science are witnesses to the force of the emotions excited by intellectual work, and civilization and progress have not weakened but rather elevated and enriched the emotional life. E. RITCHIE. TheRebigious instinct. HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL. Mind, No. 2 1, PP. 40-58; NO. 22, pp. 182-203. With the growth in complexity of life in communities, there are many forces at work leading to a repression of racial influences, and to an emphasis of individual variant ones; bringing about, on the whole, an emphasis of reason and a subordination of instinct; and leading thus to a subversion of the order of instinct efficiency which has become established in us. But the development of the higher life is, on the whole, determined by a process the exact reverse of the above. Hence the perfection of racial life would seem to demand the evolution in the race of a governing instinct, which would be regulative of reason in its relation to instinct, which would tend to suppress the variant principle, and to emphasize the force of instinc- tive appeal. Such a function is performed by the religious instinct. It may be questioned whether our religious activities are the expression of an instinct. Common sense answers this affirmatively. Psychologically, in- stinctive actions (as was shown in the first article of this series) are deter- mined by their organization, and especially by some biological end which this organization subserves. The proof of the first point, viz., that the</page><page sequence="6">556 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. actions expressive of religious feeling are organic in their nature, will be treated more fully in the next article of the series. The biological end subserved by religious activities has already been suggested. In favor of the instinctive nature of religious expression is the fact of its universality in man in one degree or another. Again, if this governing instinct exists at all, we should expect just what we find, viz., that religious expression, as far as we know, is limited to man, and furthermore, that its highest developments appear in those races in which social consolidation is most advanced. Also, like the expression of all true instincts, it seems often to be spontaneously developed. Finally, its universal presence and persist- ence shows that it has fulfilled some function of value in the development of the race. -This hypothesis must be judged by a study of the effects produced by the varied expressions of religious feeling. These special activities, which fall into a few groups, serve to emphasize the order of impulse efficiency, to which reference was made. Later formed instincts would not present themselves to consciousness with as much force as the impulses of individualistic significance and those relating to reproduction. The primitive man, in whom social instincts are beginning to develop, will with difficulty recognize as definite and distinct the impulses they determine and these would first claim attention, if they happened to appear in the form of hallucinations. In general, the conditions which induce hallucina- tory states are the very ones which would restrain individualistic reaction, and allow the less forceful but broader impulses to assert themselves. In hallucination there is a concentration of thought upon states of purely sub- jective origin. Where the processes are not carried to extremes, similar mental states will prevail, which would be closely related to the more start- ling experience. Hence we speak of our consciousness of the pressure of our impulses as though voices spoke within us. Now the various groups of religious expression suppress individualistic reaction, and lead us to listen for "the guiding voices." To hold that religious habits are forced upon the race altogether by tradition and custom cannot account for their persis- tence in wide groups of men, especially when there is found a common source of the most varied types, and a common trend to one special bio- logical benefit.-In studying the habits of seclusion, fasting, self-torture, and mysterious ceremonies, the theory is advanced that they originated and have persisted because of the impressive hallucinations which they frequently occasion. Such habits cannot be accounted for on the ground of individual advantage. In cases where men, removed by seclusion from normal environment, receive inspirations; or where, by fasting, their vitality is reduced sufficiently to overcome any natural demand for spontaneous activities; or where, by torture, deeper-lying instincts are aroused; or where, by ceremonies, habits of listening and restraint are fostered, individual- istic instincts are suppressed, and racial inspirations arise. The habit of prayer cannot be explained on the same theory. The accompanying atti- tudes indicate that it arose in connection with efforts to obtain mercy from</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 557 human conquerors; and on account of fear of higher beings it was used in addressing them. But even if it thus originated, it could not have persisted on the ground of individual advantage. There is a racial benefit gained by the implied restraint and listening for command, in that the mental attitude involved is the very one that would tend to subordinate the individual variant to the racial tendencies. In the same way, mu/a/is mutandis, are to be explained sacrificial customs and such self-sacrifice as celibacy. Making pilgrimages, praying in companionship with fellow-men, and all worshipping in common, strengthen the social bonds. - In an earlier article, it was seen that the latest elaboration of the tendency to elemental variance is reason, and it is now clear that in individualistic suppression, in the cry for aid and guidance, we gain that complex psychic state called ' faith.' Hence the main function of religious expression lies in the subor- dination of reason to faith, although this does not preclude other possible functions of value. In terms more strictly ethical, this conclusion may be thus briefly stated: the religious instinct leads us in accordance with the best that is in us to act impulsively, without waiting for the slow processes of argument and conviction. It does not perfect our moral code, but serves to give us an instinctive tendency toward the highest, as our moral life unfolds. ALBERT LEFEVRE. METAPHYSICAL AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL. Les trois dialectiques: III, La dialectique relzieuse. J. J. GOURD. Rev. de Met., V, 3, pp. 285-319. I. The Religious Obect. The religious dialectic has an object, but not a domain, of its own. If one assign the world which is ' given' to theoreti- cal dialectic, and the world which ' gives ' to practical dialectic, nothing remains over to dispose of. If, then, a third dialectic is to be formed, it must be by appropriating elements abandoned by its predecessors in their own respective domains. It can have no object but the 'incobrdinated' or the 'Absolute.' Again, the Iincoirdinated' and the 'Absolute' answer equally well to designate that which religion has actually offered as its most characteristic conception. If one can doubt of the existence outside of that which cannot be coordinated, one cannot doubt its existence within. On the practical as well as on the theoretical side, the enemy remains in posi- tion. Dialectic has neither the power nor the right to exclude it definitively. - II. The Immanent God. Here, particularly, we must avoid confusing the natural with the historical order. According to the natural order, one may say that dialectic begins with a sort of concrete phase. But soon the Absolute asserts itself. As ' given' it stands in contrast with scientific laws; as ' giving ' it stands in contrast with moral laws. We think the Absolute in proportion as it acts in us, but also it acts in us in proportion as we think</page><page sequence="8">558 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. it. This Iinco6rdinated,' which dialectic meets with under such diverse circumstances, is in a sense the substance of God. When dialectic has raised itself above evil and error, and attained power, it is God himself. And because this God dwells in the world, we may call him the immanent God. - III. The Transcendent God. But the immanent God is not enough. The doctrine of mere immanence is also that of polytheism. How shall we attain the conception of complete unity? In similar circumstances science has had recourse to abstraction. That seems calculated to help us here. Nothing is to prevent one from abstracting the general unity of the Absolute, from forming its idea. Now the idea of the Absolute, in this sense, is not a pseudo-idea. It is neither contradictory nor incomprehen- sible. But this general unity is not what we have need of here. Unfortu- nately, it is less easy to obtain the unity which results from the elimination of that which may be coordinated. To think always of God is to be a mys- tic. One may even say that the mystic alone is able to believe in the tran- scendent God. It should be remarked, however, that our transcendent God does not resemble the God of Deism any more than our immanent God resembles the God of Pantheism. Our transcendent God has signifi- cance only from the strictly religious point of view. - IV. The Personal God. The transcendent God, in turn, should give place to the personal God. Two principal considerations require this: (i) the need of deter- mining further the unity of the Absolute, and (2) what is more important, the need which the religious dialectic has of correcting itself. We require a symbolism which shall represent the highest concentration of the Absolute to which we have been able to attain. This will become the God in whom we really believe and whom we really love. In this sense the old theology has been able to say with justice that Christ is a divine person. We are now in possession of the characteristic essential to personality. The rest follows easily. Thus we should be justified in attributing to God a kind of memory. These determinations suffice. In short, religion will be found to synthesize all that dialectic had separated. E. A. L'Ide'alisme scientifiqe. PARODI. Rev. Ph., XXII, 3, pp. 280-295. This paper is the continuation of a former article (Rev. Ph., XXII, 2, PP. 144-159). The author proceeds with his statement of the philosophy of M. Durand de Gros. The first article gave his theory of life, but here his theory of being is set forth. From the structure of the nervous system and an analysis of life and consciousness, M. Durand concluded that mind and body are a unity, and that the mind is an active, creative power, the source of all functions and acts, and, through the instrumentality of organs, carries out all the purposes of thought, all the instincts of life, and all bodily movements. Every mind is a microcosm, and contains in germ all psychic functions and activities. But the special adjustments that are developed and give particularity, depend on particular conditions. Growth and devel-</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 559 opment are adaptation to the environment. This does not mean that life and energy come from without. The individual contains in itself its own actuality, its own future, its own end; the environment helps it to realize itself. It creates no faculty, no activity; it simply elicits them. The organ- ism and its external world are in interaction, and mutually produce each other. This avoids dualism, a theory which maintains two distinct sub- stances which do not react on each other. It answers materialism, for all our notions of matter are products of mind, and to subordinate spirit to matter is to make the mind a reflection of its own shadow. Matter as ex- tended is not opposed to spirit; it is a conception that can be analyzed into centres of force (atoms or monads) which are not extended. Thus psycho- logical analysis agrees with physical and chemical analysis, and the whole universe is resolved into units, monads, dynamic centres, or psychic centres. These units are not absolute and independent, but they are organic to the universe, and the best key to the solution of this problem is the human mind. The mind is a unity, and it includes in its unity different activities, various centres, and diverse thoughts; but not in the form of extension, discrete multiplicity, juxtaposition, and succession, in which they appear to the senses. To understand this organic unity of units is to comprehend the universe. "In the principle of life, in simple being, in the mind, this rH do, this Tr E, this Tb Oecou of Greek metaphysics, that is, in being properly so called, we find the beginning and the end of all things, the alpha and the omega, the supreme reason, and final explanation of things." This scientific idealism, logically carried out, reaches not only beyond the sense point of view, but it goes almost as far as Hegel's logical idealism, which fixes upon thought as the true unity, when it asserts that the individual minds have their existence and unity in one reality and one Being, the absolute Unity. EDWIN P. ROBINS. Das Ding-an-sich als Noumenon. M. J. MONRAD. Ar. f. sys. Ph., III, 2, pp. 129-149. The Ding-an-sich has too easily been dismissed from consideration as a cafiut' mortuum. It is not a mere fiction, and the author's task in this paper is to discover its meaning. It is an outgrowth of Kant's philosophy which takes a middle ground between dogmatism and scepticism. An analysis of knowledge showed Kant the dual nature of thought the phenomenon and the subjective faculty behind the phenomenon. In his system the duality became a dualism, since he made the conditions of knowledge transcendent, behind and beyond the phenomenal world. Kant is right when he says there is something more than phenomena - his refutation of scepticism. There is something that appears: the reality, the Ding-an-sich. Noumenon and phe- nomenon imply each other. Now what is the noumenon, or Ding-an-sich 9 This is answered by an analysis of thought. There are two kinds of think- ing: preventative and rational thought. Presentative thinking is merely</page><page sequence="10">560 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI particular and subjective, and the perceiving subject is dependent on indi- vidual and momentary conditions. The Vorstellung may or may not cor- respond to anything objective. But thought as such is universally valid and objective; it is free, and rises above all particulars. It is Reason. To really think is to think the true and real. False thinking is incomplete thinking. Error lies in the Vorstellung of thought, not in thought itself. But behind every Forstellung there is reality, so in every error there is always some truth. To know an object is to think it, to go beyond the phenomenon to the thing in itself. True thought is rational thought, and its object, the Ding-an-sich, must necessarily be thought as rational. But what do reason and rational thought really mean ? Thought does not consist of separate, isolated conceptions dependent on contingent circumstances; it is a system of conceptions organically linked together into a complete unity. The true object corresponds to the true thought, and is, therefore, not a dead result, but a living self-creating thought, an ideal system of living thoughts, a voos. In a word, the real thing in itself, as noumenon, is the true (subjective anld objective) thinking reason, which is not behind, but in the phenomena, their inmost substance and soul, the Idea. Thus it is the nature of thought to appear, but as appearance the thought is incomplete and externally related finite. In the Vorstellung everything is relative and conditioned by some other thing; as it-apaiears it does not correspond to the Idea (the neglect of this non-identity is the source of error). An object in imperfect relations is finite; in complete relations, infinite. The complete Idea is thought think- ing itself, self-consciousness, personality. In this conception, thought think- ing (conditioning) itself, consists the freedom of man. This is the logical result of Kant's inquiry. Causality, as Kant puts it, binds the manifold of phenomena together, but never completely. There is a loose end - the infinite regress. Causality, therefore, presupposes a causa sui. But this is not a first cause which occurred once and no longer exists, for the series would be now incomplete. This causa sui is present in every link, and outer necessity and inner freedom are but aspects of the same reality. Causality rests on interaction, and interaction implies self-determination. But only in the self-consciousness of man is self-determinationr or freedom truly realized. EDWIN P. ROBINS. Le hasard. JULES MALDIDIER. Rev. Ph., XXII, 6, pp. 561-598. The problem of the nature of chance is ordinarily considered at once one of the most important and one of the most difficult problems with which philosophy has to deal. Important it certainly is, but its difficulty has been considerably exaggerated. This general impression of its difficulty may be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that it puzzled Aristotle. Since the work of Cournot, the problem has entirely lost this aureole of mystery. Before, chance was ' something irrational,' or even ' something divine.' Cournot broke the charm and brought the matter down to earth.</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 56i But if the more difficult part of the work has been done, we need not sup- pose that it has all been done. Hence the present contribution. -After considerable discussion, Maldidier defines chance as " an interference, some- times singular, ordinarily unpredictable by reason of the complexity of its factors or of the too great number and variability of the disturbing influences to which they are exposed, in all cases unintentional and relatively contin- gent, although necessary in itself at the given moment and under the given circumstances, between two or several causal series reciprocally and rela- tively independent." - He reaches the following conclusions: (i) The sci- entific idea of chance, less comprehensive than the vulgar notion in this, that it excludes the latter's anthropomorphic and subjective element, pos- sesses an infinitely superior extension. (2) This idea, in part and only in part negative, corresponds in all its elements to an objective reality. Other- wise stated, chance exists in itself, not surely by virtue of being a cause, nor even, properly speaking, by virtue of being an effect, but rather by vir- tue of the objective and accessory character of certain effects. (3) If one consider the totality of events, and not merely the facts that are of human interest, scientifically or practically, fortuity is the almost universal rule, the normal, or that which we call so, the very great exception. (4) But chance admits of an infinity of degrees, and if the higher degrees, called pure chances, ordinarily evade scientific prediction and its consequences, the lower degrees, on the other hand, are easily enough treated. (5) There is, moreover, perfect continuity between the accidental and the normal, as well as between the accidental and the intentional. Hence a primary difficulty in discriminating them. (6) A second difficulty has to do with the fact that none of the elements constitutive of the accidental are absolute or suscepti- ble of rigorous determination. (7) The determination of chance, logically practicable, at all events, provided that one will content oneself with a more or less high degree of probability, reduces itself more and more nearly to the statement, exact or not, clear or not, of a numerical relation between different possibilities. E. A. On the Nature of the- Notion of Externality. HOWARD V. KNOX. Mind, No. 22, pp. 204-227. Scientific idealism of the type of which Professor Karl Pearson is a represen- tative does nothing, so the author thinks, in the way of upholding the cause of science as against that of constructive metaphysics. Science is the explanation of physical events which run their course independently of con- sciousness, and is not a mere descripAtion of the routine of our perceptions. Absence of routine is characteristic of our perceptions and of mental phe- nomena as a whole, and in consequence the succession of conscious states must not be regarded as parallel with the series of physical sequences of which consciousness makes us aware. The recognition of an intelligible order in nature is based upon the supposition that percepts answer to an</page><page sequence="12">562 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. order of events in no wise dependent upon consciousness. Nor does this notion of externality to which we are committed mean merely ' external to my consciousness'; for the order of physical events per se does not enter into the content of ' other consciousness' that we can know. The ' physi- cal world' and the ' external world' are therefore interchangeable expres- sions. But if physical events must be thought of as external bodies and things, whose interactions and changes constitute physical events, must likewise be thought of as external. Theories ('Apologetic Idealism' in the author's terminology) which substitute 'mental conditions,' or 'potential subjective existence,' for the idea of unperceived existence either implicitly adopt the latter idea or reduce themselves to the assertion that mental states are the exclusively determining factors of perception. Again, with regard to the mechanism of perception, psycho-physics is committed to the notion of externality.-The metaphysical conclusion reached by the article is this: "1 The question whether the external world exists, if intended as an inquiry into the constitution of the universe, is meaningless, simply because any question concerning the constitution of the universe can only be answered along the lines of the notion of externality." CARL V. TOWER.</page></plain_text>
