The criteria for authority reflected conceptions of the ideals and methods of the monastic life, and the exercise of monastic authority defined monasticism's relationship to the institutional structures of the church. This study examines the works of Nilus of Ancyra on this issue, comparing him with the legacy of Basil of Caesarea and with four of Nilus's contemporaries: John Chrysostom, Palladius of Helenopolis, Alexander the Sleepless, and Hypatius, abbot of the Rufinianes monastery. Nilus was influenced by the thought of Evagrius Ponticus and to this extent had links with Egypt. The Egyptian monastic tradition had developed a three- fold criterion for authority: historical continuity (discipleship under one of the great masters or one of his successors), experience (be that primarily ascetical or contemplative), and inspiration or charismatic gifts, such as performing mira- cles. As an Evagrian, and so as one who defined the monk as above all a con- templative, Nilus emphasized experience as the essential criterion. To arrive at a position of authority, a monk must have undergone interior battle with and tri- umph over the passions, which requires acute observation of the inner workings of the soul. This victory leads to an interior tranquility, which prepares the soul for contemplation of the higher, spiritual realities. For Nilus, monastic authority had two chief expressions: didactic and prophetic. As a teacher, the monk assumed responsibility for the spiritual guidance of others, exercising *The Harvard Theological Review periodically includes summaries of Harvard doctoral disserta- tions recently accepted in the Th.D. program of the Divinity School and in the Ph.D. program under the Committee on the Study of Religion, a standing committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with membership from both that Faculty and the Faculty of the Divinity School.

The monk's own experience in spiritual battle served as preparation for this task. Tradition had portrayed the biblical prophets as proto-anchorites. For Nilus, the parallels ran deeper than desert dwelling or ascetical regimen. In his correspondence, Nilus speaks out against evil and injustice, like an Amos or Jeremiah. Nilus criticized many clerics but was not schismatic, remaining loyal to the larger church despite his prophetic self-understanding. He thus stood between Alexander and the Basilian legacy. These threatened the institutional future of monasticism, the former by an anti-institutional Messalianism which alienated bishops, the latter by defining monks as essentially servants of the bishops, which endangered the distinctiveness (and therefore the need for) monks. Douglas Renfrew Brooks [Ph.D., Study of Religion] A Study of the Texts and Contexts of the Living Traditions in South India. This dissertation offers a historical and theological study of one of the major sects of Hindu Sakta Tantrism. The SrTvidya school has flourished in India since at least the seventh century CE and presents one of the most elaborate forms of the esoteric worship of the goddess in a beneficient aspect in Hindu tradition. This study proceeds from the assumption that Hindu Tantrism is best under- stood as a sectarian regional phenomenon reflecting pan-Indian values and con- cepts, an assumption reflecting Tantric's own understandings. It further accepts that any historical, theological, or textual study must also include interpretive input from the living oral traditions since Tantrics have deliberately obscured materials in order to limit access to initiated followers. The study focuses on the SrTvidya school in south India, and in Tamil Nadu in particular. Part One traces the historical development of the school from the earliest available sources in Sanskrit and Tamil, including references to its specific mantra (sound identified with the deity) and yantra (geometric form of the deity) by the sixth-century Tamil saint Tirumilar. The theological under- standing of the goddess in her beneficient anthropomorphic forms as Lalita Tri- purasundari, the mantra known as the srtvidyd and the complex configuration known as the srcakra are given extensive treatment. Part Two examines the historical and theological material as it is interpreted and practiced by contemporary SrTvidya adepts in Tamil Nadu. It includes case studies of five specific lineages and a number of individual adepts: its primary focus is srividya's practice and interpretation in both private and public settings, including its presence in several major Saiva temples. Issues including the role of authority, ritual symbolism and women within Srividya, as well as the con- cept of scripture are raised in the course of both Parts One and Two. 478</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS Appendix One presents for the first time in a European language a translation of the Tripurd Upanisadbhdsya of Bhaskararaya with critical notes, annotations, and emendations that correct previous editions of the text. This small but important source presents a summary of many of the central issues within Srividya tradition and continues to play a role in contemporary practice. Michael Candelaria [Th.D.] Popular Religion and Liberation: An Examination of the Discussion in Latin American Liberation Theology. One of the key theological issues facing Latin American liberation theology is the role of popular religion in the process of socio-historical liberation. Liberation theologians have taken diverse stances toward popular religion. Some have seen in popular religion only an alienating factor, detaining its adherents from actively participating in the struggle for social change. Others, however, recognize the liberating potential contained in popular religious beliefs, symbols, and practices. This thesis is an examination of this discussion in Latin American liberation theology. Besides offering an overview of the discussion, this thesis examines key terms like "popular," "popular culture," and "popular religion," hoping thereby to arrive a a more rigorous definition. The central core of the thesis is an analysis of the theological writings of Juan Carlos Scannone of Argentina and of Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay. Scannone takes a positive stance toward popular religion, whereas Segundo rates popular religion as an inert phenomenon. The thesis uncovers the key theological categories used by both theologians to articulate their respective positions and sets the discussion in the framework of their larger theological vision. The purpose of this analysis is to arrive at an understanding of why they make such evaluations of popular reli- gion and how they do so. In the conclusion, I discuss my theological conclu- sions based on a comparative analysis of Scannone and Segundo. Moreover, I set forth theological-pastoral principles and biblical criteria of discernment from a liberation perspective that lead to a critical evangelization of popular religion. Robert A. Di Vito [Ph.D., NELC] Studies in Third Millennium Sumerian and Akkadian Onomastics: The Designation and Conception of the Personal God. Personal names traditionally have played a large role in the investigation of the language, the culture, and the religion of ancient Semitic peoples. This thesis examines the personal names of the Sumerians and Akkadians of the third millennium BCE in order to probe their significance for understanding a particu- lar Mesopotamian religious concept, the so-called "personal god." As formu- lated above all by Thorkild Jacobsen, the personal god denotes that divine being seen to take a personal interest in an individual and his fortunes, whom he 479</page><page sequence="4">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW worshiped in a private cult, and to whom he turned with his immediate personal concerns. Previous studies of the personal god drawing upon onomastic evidence have generally handled that evidence uncritically or have been seriously limited by its ambiguity and uncertain interpretation (Chapter One). Uncertainty, for exam- ple, about the meaning and use of ilum (Akk. "god"), d ingir (Sum. "god"), and the graph IL in Akkadian and Sumerian personal names of this period have proven a major limitation. Chapter Two, therefore, demonstrates that in Sumerian personal names dingir represents a positional variant of dingir-mu ("my god") in the composition of personal names, both dingir and dingir-mu functioning, in other words, as designations of the personal god. Similarly, the survey of Akkadian names in Chapter Three demonstrates the complementarity of suffixed and unsuffixed forms of ilum in neutrally cast and subjectively framed names, respectively. For its part, the graph IL in the older names is not a proper name, viz. 'Il (Canaanite El), but most likely a "Kish-type" logogram for ilum. The thesis attempts an exhaustive collection of names in both traditions alluding to the personal god. This collection demonstrates that the conception of the personal god, in particular, and of the gods, generally, derivable from the personal names, has been shaped by a common theological perspective. This perspective belongs to the tradition of name-giving itself, and may with proba- bility be assigned to "popular religion." Specifically, it represents the perspec- tive and viewpoint of the family, the primary community to which the individual belonged. Within the sphere of the family, where the individual's concerns for progeny, health, and well-being achieve a privileged status, the concept of a "personal god" becomes intelligible. Personal-god language represents, not an autonomous religious conception within Mesopotamian religion, but the reflex in language of domestic piety. Lindsey Beth Harlan [Ph.D., Study of Religion] The Ethic of Protection among Rajput Women: Religious Mediations of Caste and Gender Duties. This dissertation examines ways in which Rajput narrative traditions reflect and influence relationships between religiously sanctioned caste duties and gender roles. Its findings are the result of field research on Rajput women in Rajasthan, India. The traditional caste duties of Rajp's are ruling and fighting. These duties, conceived as duties of protection, are incumbent upon Rajpit men, who are deemed endowed with inherent administrative and military capacities. Rajput women, however, perform duties that are primarily derived from gender iden- tity, not caste affiliation. Their Rajpit blood serves simply to enhance their natural capacity as women to perform domestic roles. Foremost among these is 480</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS the role of husband-protector. A woman must be responsible for her husband's health and home. Physically tracing the ideological separation of male-caste and female- household duties is the Rajpit practice of pdrdd, women's seclusion within the home. Pdrdd symbolizes the assessment of male and female duties as comple- mentary: whereas men perform outdoor, women perform indoor, labors. Although these distinctions appear to be rigid, all of the major Rajpiit narra- tive traditions reveal an underlying fluidity. While demonstrating disharmonies between male caste duties and female gender duties, these traditions frequently employ role reversals in which women assume male responsibilities. In so doing, they allow for symbolic solutions of caste-gender conflicts, while main- taining the importance of gender segregation at the social level. In depicting these solutions, the dissertation details three preeminent Rajpiit narrative traditions. More specifically, it suggests that mythical portrayals of tensions between caste and gender duties reveal ways in which Rajpuits have understood religious innovation and adaptation over time. Finally, focusing on paradigms of sacred duty, it makes an excursion into the realm of comparative religious ethics.

Charles Anthony Kimball [Th.D.] Striving Together in the Way of God: Muslim Participation in Christian-Muslim Dialogue. Relations between Christians and Muslims, steeped in centuries of mistrust, misunderstanding, and antipathy, began a new phase during the past quarter cen- tury as the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Vatican, and various Chris- tian academic centers initiated programs for interfaith dialogue. The dialogue movement represents an effort to stimulate communication, foster understand- ing, correct stereotypes, and explore similarities and differences between adherents of the two largest religious traditions. The WCC's "dialogue in com- munity" emphasis includes theological reflection on issues of religious plural- ism. It goes further, however, by elevating the pressing concerns of peaceful coexistence, social and economic injustice, political repression, world hunger, etc., and challenging people of faith to search for ways to work cooperatively on the problems that threaten the human family. This dissertation studies the his- tory, effectiveness, and significance of the WCC's dialogue initiatives for three active Muslim participants and, through them, for selected communities. Further, the research provides a means to critique the WCC's dialogue activities and models. And, since parochial understandings contribute to comprehensive ones, it is hoped that the study of individual Muslims from four distinct contexts (Great Britain, Tunisia, Lebanon, and the Philippines) will yield fresh insights into contemporary Islam. Global interdependence demands understanding and 481</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW cooperation across religious, cultural, and political lines. The dialogue move- ment may provide a vital link in coming years as regional conflicts and activities of extremist groups threaten to polarize further various Christian and Muslim communities. Theodore J. Lewis [Ph.D., NELC] Cults of the Dead in Ancient Israel and Ugarit. The present work argues that there was an ongoing battle throughout ancient Israel's history between adherents of Yahwism and those who practiced death cult rituals. While normative Yahwism may have been resolute in its condem- nation of such practices, a strong circumstantial case can be built for their existence in the popular religion. It is argued that vestiges of death cult practice may be found in the stories of Saul's encounter at Endor, Absalom's erection of a massebet to invoke his name, Jezebel's burial, and Elisha's life-giving bones. It is also suggested that the legal prohibitions against cults of the dead in the Deuteronomistic and Priestly material are clear reflections of their ongoing prac- tice in ancient Israelite society. Ugaritic literature is looked at for comparative purposes. The two most important texts for our understanding of cults of the dead at Ugarit are RS 34.126 and KTU 1.113. The treatment of RS 34.126 is based on two new collec- tions of the text. It is argued that this text is Niqmaddu's funerary liturgy and describes the essential services provided to him by his successor Ammurapi. It is also argued that the role of the Goddess Sapsu in lines 18-26 is to transport the deceased down to the underworld. KTU 1.113 is used, along with other texts, to show that it was possible to refer to the deceased as a "god" throughout the ancient Near East. This was not an attempt to "deify" the dead in the sense of making them equal to the high gods in the pantheon. Rather, referring to the deceased as an ilu (or 'elohim) was an attempt to describe their preternatural character. In addition to these two texts, the present work also examines the mortuary character of CTA 17.1.26-34 and KTU 6.13, 6.14. Finally, this study examines the question of whether the ancient Semitic institu- tion known as the marzeah was a banquet for and with departed ancestors. Vasiliki Marie Limberis [Th.D.] Identities and Images of the Theotokos in the Akathistos Hymn. The Akathistos Hymn is an anonymous fifth-century kontakion in praise of the Virgin Mary. It is the most widely known and influential Marian hymn of Eastern Christendom. The Theotokos depicted in the kontakion embodies a variety of characteristics never before attributed to her. They stem from several Graeco-Roman goddess traditions, as well as Jewish, Christian, and apocryphal literature. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the myriad of 482</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS identities of the Theotokos within the socio-historical context of Constantinople of the late fourth and early fifth centuries. How the political ideology and the social values for women act as the interpretive principle in creating the "Theo- tokos" is critically evaluated. The first chapter discusses the evidence from numismatics, epigraphy, and literature that the Theotokos acts as Tyche of Constantinople. Investigation into the traditions of Demeter and Isis attempts to explain some of the most obscure metaphors in the hymn. The second chapter offers an interpretation of the Theotokos as assuming the functions of the Sophia of Hellenistic Jewish litera- ture. How the basileia of the Theotokos was possibly shaped by the contem- porary ideology of female imperium is the focus of the third chapter. The first part investigates the life of Empress Pulcheria (399-454), and the vitae of five prominent, yet representative, women ascetics. The second section asesses the art-historical evidence for royal Marian imagery in the fifth century. Finally, a comparison of the hymn with the Virgin who appears in the kontakia of Romanos Melodus (ca. 560) highlights-by contrast-the distinctive imperial features unique to fifth-century portrayals of the Theotokos. Mark Stephen Massa [Th.D.] Charles Augustus Briggs and the Crisis of Histor- ical Criticism. Charles Augustus Briggs, more clearly than any other Protestant scholar in late nineteenth-century America, reveals the true nature of the intellectual impulses effecting what has been termed by historians the "spiritual crisis of the Gilded Age." During that critical half century following Appomattox, Briggs played a central role in the theological and ecclesiastical battles that led to the fragmentation of the American religious establishment into modernist and fun- damentalist camps. Both religious and cultural historians have long agreed as to Briggs's importance in understanding the religious battles of late nineteenth- century America, and have agreed also as to the significance of his famous 1893 heresy trial in representing the theological issues behind those battles. But his- torians have, by and large, misunderstood the true nature of Briggs's importance in representing the course of American cultural and religious history. More dramatically than any other evangelical figure, Briggs embodied in his own person the confrontation of the older, Protestant worldview with historicism in the bitter exchanges during his heresy trial, and what Briggs spent his per- sonal and professional life attempting to reconcile, were the seemingly irrecon- cilable claims of revivalistic evangelicalism with historical criticism. His was essentially an American story-perhaps the American story-of the "coming of age" of the evangelical mind in the moder world, an intellectual world that defined itself largely in historicist terms. 483</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW While historicism thus emerges as the main theme in this fin de siecle tale of internecine betrayal and civil war, Charles Briggs provides a human face for grappling with this tale's very real disembodied theme. Briggs's career as evangelical scholar offers the study of Gilded Age America dramatic witness both to the well founded claims of cultural hegemony made by progressive evangelicals at the close of the nineteenth century and to the troubled peace made by those cultural spokespersons with a modern critical worldview.

Sam Meier [Ph.D., NELC] The Messenger (mal'dk and mar sipri) in the Ancient Semitic World. The specific task of this work is to begin collecting the considerable, but as yet unsifted, data relating to the activity of messengers in the ancient Semitic world (down to the Persian period), orchestrating this data into a coherent, com- posite portrait of the messenger in the performance of one of his tasks, namely the bearing of information from one party to another. This is not a survey of all types of messenger figures, being restricted to a detailed analysis of the West Semitic mal'dk and the Akkadian mar sipri. Although this is a study of a human social phenomenon, not designed as an investigation into angelogy or specula- tion about the activity of divine messengers, insights from the latter are employed when it is possible to illuminate the behavior of human messengers. Based upon textual data supplied from all available sources, the entire pro- cess of communication by messenger is analyzed in detail: the selection of the messenger, his commissioning, preparations for his journey, what he can expect as he travels, his arrival at his destination, his reception and attendant protocol, the delivery of his message, hospitality which he might receive, and his ultimate return to the one who sent him. Russell David Nelson [Ph.D., NELC] Studies in the Development of the Taber- nacle Account. This dissertation reexamines the differences in vocabulary, content, and order between the Hebrew and Greek texts of the Tabernacle Account as found in Exodus 25-31 and 35-40. The Introduction discusses the solutions offered by Popper, Finn, and Gooding and offers a new approach based on recent text criti- cal theories. Chapter One compares 141 Hebrew words found in the Tabernacle account with their Greek translations in Exodus, 1 Kings 6-8, 2 Chronicles 3-6, Josephus, and the Kaige recension. The comparison reveals that the Old Greek is preserved in Greek chapters 37 and 38 of Exodus. The remainder of the Greek in the Tabernacle Account compares with the Palestinian Greek of Josephus and 2 Chronicles. Further comparison with known Kaige charac- 484</page><page sequence="9">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS teristics reveals a shared background but does not point to the Palestinian Greek of the Tabernacle Account as belonging to the Kaige Recension. It is concluded that the Old Greek of the Tabernacle Account has been revised by a later trans- lator. Chapter Two examines the possible reasons for two Greek translators. A synoptic study of each section of the Tabernacle Account demonstrates a con- sistent pattern of development in the text from the account as preserved in the Old Greek to the Hebrew text of chapters 35-40 to the Hebrew chapters of 25-31 to the Greek of 25-31 and the remainder of Greek chapters 35-40. Other texts, such as the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Qumran fragments, Josephus, Numbers, 1 Kings, and 2 Chronicles, provide support for the various stages of development of the text of the Tabernacle Account. It is concluded that the Old Greek was revised as a result of the revision of its Hebrew Vorlage. Chapter Three reviews the order of the Tabernacle Account as preserved in the various Hebrew and Greek texts and compares them with the lists of objects made for the tabernacle. From both content and vocabulary it is demonstrated that none of the lists were present in the Vorlage of the Old Greek. It is concluded that the change in order between the Old Greek and the Hebrew of 35-40 was the result of a change in the Hebrew text which sought to expand the account. The conclusion suggests relative dates for each of the stages of development in the text of the Tabernacle Account. The thesis was written under the direction of Frank Moore Cross, Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages at Harvard University. Michael Wallace O'Laughlin [Th.D.] Origenism in the Desert: Anthropology and Integration in Evagrius Ponticus. Evagrius Ponticus, archdeacon to Gregory of Nazianzus in Constantinople, abandoned the court due to a scandal and went to Jerusalem and Egypt, where he was inspired by the celebrated desert fathers and became a monk himself. He gathered disciples and began to teach a new, more speculative and psycho- logical spirituality. Evagrius's program forms two parts: (1) an elementary training in asceticism, virtue, and control of one's thoughts, and (2) the reception of an esoteric theory concerning the origin of the world, metempsychosis and divinization. He was condemned for the latter teachings in 553 as part of the repression of Origenism. This thesis attempts to measure the integration of the two main parts of Evagrian thought, and of the man himself, by investigating his anthropology using biography and exegesis. Chapter One is the first full-length biography of Evagrius ever attempted. It shows the exciting life of an extremist whose submission to physical austerity produced virtuosity and love for others. 485</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Subsequent chapters examine the anthropological teaching of five of his writ- ings: Ad Melaniam, the Kephalaia gnostica, the Gnosticus, De oratione, and the Practicus. These chapters show that a particular anthropology was basic to his writings. A person must analyse his inner compulsions and needs in terms of body, soul, and nous, the last being the center of the true person. There are determined stages which a person passes through in order to return to God, stages which move from ignorance to contemplative knowledge, successive incarnations, and finally theosis as a co-heir with Christ. The tripartite composi- tion and staged trajectory are taught or assumed in all the writings studied. However, the issue of the origin and destiny of the person is absent from the ele- mentary treatises. Chapter Two suggests in passing that Ad Melaniam, a speculative work, was written against Pelagius years before Pelagius became involved in open contro- versy with St. Augustine. In several cases these are the first studies done on these documents. This pre- viously neglected figure is now credited with being one of the greatest influences on the Christian spiritual tradition of all times. It is hoped that this study advances our assessment of Evagrius in several ways. A. Kevin Reinhart [Th.D.] Before Revelation: The Boundaries of Muslim Moral Knowledge. Between the fourth and seventh Islamic centuries, Muslim students of dialec- tical theology (kaldm) and of principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh) debated a set of issues linked to the question: What is the assessment of an act before the arrival of the shar'? Our thesis is that what seems here to be a straightforward debate between "Revelationists" and "Rationalists" is more properly under- stood as a debate among proponents of various theories of Revelation. This dissertation defines the controversy and presents the several positions taken: that pre-Revelational acts are to be described as proscribed, permitted, or as impossible to assess. A brief doxography discusses the participants in this debate and attempts to account for divergences of opinion within legal and theo- logical schools. Further, we attempt to locate this question against a background of the evol- ving Islamic legal sciences in the second, third, and early fourth Islamic centu- ries. One particular problem, that of the obligation to "thank the benefactor," is investigated in depth, and it is shown that the debate on this topic is really a debate between those defending an archaic pre- and early Islamic idea (the Mu'tazili theological school) and those defending a newer understanding of God and His message Two translations are included here also. The first, a translation of a section from al-Jassas's "principles of jurisprudence" work, al-Fusul, defends the notion that before Revelation useful acts have the status "permitted." The 486</page><page sequence="11">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS second translation, from al-Ghazall's work al-Mustasfd, argues that such acts cannot be assessed before Revelation since the only grounds for assessment are Revelational indicants (dalil al-shar'). Two other chapters discuss two Muctazill moral ontologies and their epistemologies, and criticism of them by other Mu'tazilis as well as Ash'aris and HanbalTs. Finally we describe the sharl'ah epistemology and suggest tikat it is best understood as a consciously developed alternative to the Muctazilah moral epistemology previously discussed. Rene Josef Riittimann [Th.D.] Asclepius and Jesus: The Form, Character and Status of the Asclepius Cult in the Second Century CE and Its Influence on Early Christianity. This research explores the role and status of the Asclepius cult in the second century CE, especially with regard to its healing activity. Literary and archaeo- logical evidence is used to show that the Asclepius cult was at its peak of popu- larity and constituted the most popular healing religion during this time. Its influence was strongly felt throughout the Graeco-Roman world. The status of Asclepius as a savior and his cult's healing practice are discussed in order to evaluate the impact of this cult on that of the new healer, Jesus, and on the development of the Christian healing tradition. Evidence from the Asclepieia, both artifacts and inscriptions, show that the followers of Jesus were confronted with this other savior. The literary evidence confirms this by clearly stating the similarities and differences between the two cults. The followers of Asclepius and Jesus worshiped rather similar deities, pro- fessed similar theological understandings and used miraculous healings as proof of divinity. Both cults reported miracles in a rather uniform manner, by means of lengthy, narrative-style healing accounts. These autobiographical reports were considered to be divinely inspired, holy words of god, and both groups used them in their missionary propaganda. As the Asclepius cult waned and Christianity gained adherents, former func- tions of the cult were taken over by the new religion. As one of the last Hel- lenistic deities to be vanquished by Christianity, the cult of Asclepius left a strong mark on the development of Christianity through its impact on Christianity's developing self-understanding as a healing religion and on the conception of Jesus as a healer and a universal savior god. Richard Hughes Seager [Ph.D., Study of Religion] The World's Parliament of Religions, Chicago Illinois, 1893; America's Religious Coming of Age. The first serious religious encounter between the United States and Asia took place at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, Illinois in September 487</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of 1893. A part of America's celebration of the quadricentennial of Columbus's discovery of the New World, the Parliament was held at a time when optimism, cosmopolitan idealism, and millennial expectations were running high, and to many American Christians the Parliament seemed to be a latter-day reenactment of Pentecost. For many liberals this Pentecost suggested the dawning of a new era of spiritual cooperation among the religions of the world, perhaps even the establishment of a universal natural religion. For more traditional Christians it suggested that the conversion of the world to Christ was at hand. Asians, although partaking of the buoyant hopes of the age, saw the event in a different light; for them the Parliament was a formal debut for the spirit of New Asia with its revitalized national religious tradition. The controversies during and after the Parliament ultimately turned on the meaning of a fundamental moder and American ideal: the freedom of religion. Did this ideal imply the right of non-Christians to persist in error or incomple- tion until the final fulfillment of all the world's religions in Christ, Christianity, and Christian values? Or did this imply that Asian religions had a free and equal claim to full religious truth? After the Parliament, many conservative Christians were deeply troubled by what appeared to them to be a serious compromise of their faith. Moderates advocated a new tolerance towards Asian religions, but remained unchanged in their conviction of the ultimate superiority of Christianity. Liberals redoubled their efforts to build a cosmopolitan and inclusive-but essentially assimilative-universal and natural religion for all the world. At the same time representatives of the Asian religions began their own missions to the people of the United States, while a few American religious intellectuals began to articu- late a new variant of the nation's traditional ideal of freedom: religious plural- ism. The Parliament was a rite of passage for America, a transition from an era when the United States was often considered, however inaccurately, to be a Christian, even a Protestant, union into an era marked by increasing religious pluralism. The United States had gone into the Parliament aspiring to be a cosmopolitan nation; after the Parliament a radical kind of cosmopolitan reli- giosity became a fact of life. Russell Foster Sizemore [Ph.D., Study of Religion] Reinhold Niebuhr and the Rhetoric of Liberal Anti-Communism: Christian Realism and the Cold War. In response to contemporary uncertainty concerning the political legacy of Reinhold Niebuhr's Christian realism, this dissertation surveys Niebuhr's interpretation of America's participation in international affairs during the early years of the Cold War. By giving close attention to Niebuhr's many editorials and shorter writings, this study traces his initial attempts to find a conciliatory path with Russia, his 1946 conversion to a more confrontational stance, his 488</page><page sequence="13">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS articulation of a theological and philosophical rationale for the policy of con- tainment, and his reflection on the attempt to extend this policy to the Cold War in Asia. This historical account is interwoven with an analysis of Niebuhr's po- litical philosophy and his attempt to interpret the resources of Christian faith for the struggle. The study finds that Niebuhr attempts to mobilize patriotic fervor and employ the terms of national interest in order to broaden America's sense of obligation and commitment to more general interests. He argued for the centrality of power in order to advocate an expanded, morally sensitive conception of power. In sum, Niebuhr militantly espoused liberal measures to counter the conserva- tive militarists of his time and offered a realistic rationale for exercising moral restraint. This technique of rhetorical reversal allowed Niebuhr to integrate a variety of motivations into his appeals and to offer an apparently balanced and comprehensive analysis. But it also made his arguments easily susceptible to one-sided distortions and less liberal appropriations. The dissertation concludes that Niebuhr's ideological orientation, his emphasis on prudence, his consequentialism, and his basic confidence in the relative virtue of American values and institutions establish strong links with the contemporary neoconservative movement. But the essence of his liberal anti- communism was that these elements were inseparably combined with a peren- nial demand for self-criticism and a vigorous critique of America's bourgeois ideology. His most basic commitment was to heighten America's sense of the limits of its strength, wisdom, and virtue, in order to restrain national appetites and pride. James David Smith III [Th.D] The Ignatian Long Recension and Christian Communities in Fourth Century Syrian Antioch. Based on the work of Zahn and Lightfoot, there is a century-long consensus among scholars regarding the genuine and spurious in the letters attributed to Ignatius, second-century martyr-bishop of Syrian Antioch. The seven Greek letters of the "Middle Recension" (MR) are authentically Ignatian, in contrast to the abbreviated Syriac form (SR) and the Greek "Long Recension" (LR) which contains the seven letters, interpolated and enlarged, plus six additional wholly spurious letters. Scholars agree that the LR dates from the latter half of the fourth century, with Syrian Antioch the most likely provenance, composed by a redactor with broadly Arian (not Nicene) sympathies. Affinities with the Apostolic Constitu- tions (AC) persuade most to attribute both to the same hand. The AC, dated ca. 360-80 (Turner, Brightman), is seen as the earlier work. Discussions of authorship and specific theological orientation, however, have proven incon- clusive. "Pseudo-Ignatius" has remained an elusive figure. 489</page><page sequence="14">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW This study focuses on Antiochene church life in the mid-fourth century. Theological and ecclesiological aspects of the schism there, and of the LR, are examined. What emerges is the thesis that the LR issued from Antioch's Homoian party, led by the old Arian bishop Euzious, ca 373, shortly after the AC. Both documents were produced to meet the internal and missionary needs of that moderate Arian Christian community, which occupied the city's "Great Church" for over a decade. Specifically, the dissertation's four chapters argue (1) that this party "resurrected" Ignatius (relics and persona) from revered obscurity as their literary vehicle: a much needed Arian saint and advocate; (2) that the Antiochene schism provides the background, and the independent Homoian pro- gram of Euzoius the occasion, for the LR; (3) that, theologically, the LR is a Homoian (l[toto;: the Son is "like" the Father) eirenikon, inviting endorsement from those on all sides of a traditional, conservative, eclectic, biblical Antiochene center; and (4) that the perspectives on Judaism, asceticism, and church/state issues fill out the witness of a document which (with the AC) sheds a unique light on the church, Antiochene and Arian, in the later fourth century. Sarah Jean Tanzer [Ph.D., Study of Religion] The Sages at Qumran: Wisdom in the Hodayot. Wisdom literature has long been recognized as a significant aspect of the cul- ture of the Ancient Near East. In ancient Israel, this literature was an important vehicle for primarily secular, cultural, and ethical values. What is less well known and little studied is the pervasive influence of wisdom literature in the Hellenistic period. In order to begin to clarify the complex nature and function of Wisdom in the Hellenistic period, I have focused my attention on a single community: Qum- ran, and within that community, on 1QHa, a manuscript which includes approxi- mately thirty-seven Hodayot. The appropriation of wisdom elements by Qum- ran reflects a shift from wisdom literature as primarily secular literature, as in ancient Israel, to the use of wisdom language in diverse literary genres to express the religious thought and values of the community. The first four chapters of the dissertation provide a detailed study of 1QH. Chapter One, "Hodayot in Which the Presence of Wisdom is Strong," identifies the characteristics of those Hodayot in which wisdom elements (forms, themes, words) are most pervasive. Chapter Two, "Non-Wisdom Hodayot," looks at those compositions at the opposite end of the scale, in which the phenomenon of Wisdom is negligible at best. Having established the contrast between these two groups of compositions, in Chapter Three I examine the characteristics of the largest group of Hodayot, "Hodayot in Which the Presence of Wisdom is Lim- ited." Chapter Four, "Conclusions to the Study of 1QH," includes both gen- eral conclusions as well as final observations about the presence of Wisdom in 490</page><page sequence="15">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS 1QH. Chapter Five, "The Sages at Qumran," considers those important issues about Wisdom which deserve further scrutiny and provides a cursory glance at the presence of Wisdom in the remaining Qumran texts. Finally, one should note that the order of the dissertation represents a reversal of that found in previous studies of the Qumran corpus and Wisdom. It starts with 1QH and the other texts of the Qumran community and reconstructs from them, a posteriori, a working definition of the presence of Wisdom (and the cri- teria by which one establishes it), instead of beginning with standard a priori definitions. This allows one to account more fully for the developments at Qumran and in the Hellenistic period. Tomoaki Tsuchida [Ph.D., Study of Religion] Mind and Reality: A Study of the Shoulengyanjing. The present study is an attempt to understand what were the main philosophi- cal issues, among other things, in the Buddhist vs. Confucian dispute in the Song period (A.D. 960-1279). To approach this complex question, we have here focused upon one Buddhist scripture which seems to represent an important aspect of the Buddhist spirituality at that time. The scripture, commonly known by its shortened names Shoulengyanjing and Lengyanjing, appeared sometime in the eighth century as the last major Mahayana sutra to appear in China. It became widely accepted as a major sutra from around the tenth century, and has been popular to this very day among the Chinese people. It has been studied lit- tle by moder students of Buddhism, however, partly because of doubts con- cerning its "authenticity," i.e., whether it was Chinese or Indian. The scripture's significance in Chinese history of spirit is far from negligible, regard- less of its authenticity. Here we have investigated the philosophical aspect of this sutra, especially its ontology of mind. According to this scripture, there is in each person the a priori self-luminous awareness which, as the true master-agent, enables him or her to see, hear, feel, etc. For salvation, one only needs to become aware of this and return to it through ascetic practices and dharani recitation. The text urges people to look beyond materiality to the uniquely human, transcendent dimension. This soteriological philosophy gravitates toward the negation of the wholeness of human and other beings, at the cost of extramental world, body included: it posits the primordial mind alone behind the psycho-physical phenomenal world. As a type of "gnostic," virtually dualistic, view, this philosophy of mind was to receive criticism from within the Buddhist tradition and from the Zhu Xi school of Confucian tradition. The nature of this scripture is elucidated here by counterexamining some of these criticisms. 491</page><page sequence="16">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Lawrence Mitchell Wills [Th.D.] The Jew in the Court of the Foreign King: Ancient Jewish Court Legends. Although scholars sometimes speak of such Jewish writing as Genesis 37-50, Esther, Daniel 1-6, Bel and the Dragon, and 1 Esdras 3-4 as "court narratives," the genre has never been given a comprehensive study. This thesis attempts to set forth the nature and extent of this genre, to understand its social context and presuppositions, and to analyze Esther and Daniel 1 -6 as examples of this genre. Chapter One proposes the genre designation "wisdom court legend," and proceeds to define each part of that designation in some detail. Of the various subgenres of the wisdom court legend, contexts of courtiers and conflicts between courtiers, in which the protagonist is persecuted and then vin- dicated, are especially noted. This thesis focuses on the conflict as an important subgenre of the wisdom court legend. After searching out examples of the genre in several world literatures (Persian, Egyptian, Hebrew, and Greek), Chapter Two posits a common function for the genre: it is generally used to affirm the role and value of the protagonist's ethnic group in the worldwide imperial administration. The court legends in the Danielic corpus, Daniel 1 -6, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon, are analyzed next, and the sources of these legends and the growth of the corpus is outlined. Esther is then treated in terms of its source layers, and the following stages are hypothesized: the earliest narrative concerning Morde- cai and Haman only, a second level which introduces the Esther subplot, a third layer attested by the Greek A text, in which we first find Purim and the revenge motif, and the MT version, in which these motifs are extended. In my conclu- sions chapter, the strands of development of the genre are again charted and the layers of the Danielic corpus and Esther are placed in the schema.
