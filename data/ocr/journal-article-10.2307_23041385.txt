<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unity and Trinity in Dionysius and Eriugena Werner Beierwaltes I The philosophy of late Antiquity was fired by the endeavour to investigate the concept of unity and the concept of tri-unity; the latter as a form of unity and plurality. The adoption in manifold forms, and the transformation into a new thought structure, of Plato's central question justifies the characterisation of this philosophy as Neo Platonism. The central tenet of Neoplatonism is the concept of Unity, which is construed in terms of the search for the one ground and origin of the differentiated many, a concept which was to remain fruitful in the subsequent history of thought, and by no means as mere historical reminiscence. This thought determined one of the major philosophic trends in medieval and modern philosophy, the latter from Spinoza and Leibniz up to the Idealism of Fichte, Hegel and Schelling. Christian theology was, and has been since its beginning, decidedly involved in this its own special concern: the philosophical relationship between unity and trinity. The systematic analysis of just this question is the necessary presupposition for the working out of a form of reflexion which at least approximates to the central Christian thought of the Trinity or Tri-Unity. The Trinity - the three essence and appearance forms of the One God - is revealed by the New Testament as a basic truth and is experienced and adored as a mystery stricto sensu similar to the Incarnation. Yet, nevertheless, this concept was a continual challenge for strenuous reflexion. It was not that the incomprehensible should be made comprehensible but rather that the attempt should be undertaken towards a conceptual approximation. Reflexion should thus be a circling delineation of the Trinity which makes faith in the Trinity intelligible, justified by reflexion, and a binding communicable faith.1. During the long lasting and momentous process of the "Hellenizing of Christianity" the conceptuality of Greek metaphysics substantially conditioned the dogmatisation of Christian truth whether consciously or unconsciously. Herein we find many theological tenets which only through philosophical reflexion and theoretical form come to be what they are, or at least through philosophy gain a convincing character for</page><page sequence="2">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 the Faith as a whole. This is particularly true for the question of creation as the unfolding of the divine Will and Goodness, for the ideas as the structures of divine Thought, for the concept of God as identical with absolute Being in the sense of a reflexively moved immutability, for the concept of a hypostatic Unity of God and man in Christ, for the concepts of will and freedom, arche and logos, eternity, time and history, and the issue of the approach towards knowledge of God through affirmative, symbolic and negative theology. None of these theological tenets is more intensively determined by, and so deeply interwoven with, philosophical concepts and theories than the Trinity. Its intelligibility depends upon more or less developed concepts of unity, singleness, simplicity, and further the three-ness which indicates a characteristic difference in the unity, but which nonetheless should not be understood as numerical in the mathematical sense; difference and characteristic individuality as elements in the unity; at the same time the inseparability, non-distinctness or even "equality" through which the characteristic three form the Trinity in itself: "in his igitur tribus quam sit inseparabilis distinctio et tamen distinctio, videat qui potest."2 No less decisive for the reflexive form of the Trinity is the ontological meaning of the concept of relation which founds and carries a reciprocal interpenetration of tri- and un-ity: Trinity as a correlative unity which is Itself only through self-relatedness. Essentially comprehensible and expressible is such a Unity as Being in the most intensive sense which is both unfolding in Itself and thinking Itself, reflecting Spirit: the Trinity is a self-reflexive circle whose Unity constitutes itself timelessly as thinking, as willing - and as loving - himself. Besides this open, clear, conceptual basis and besides the hitherto hidden philosophic implications, the concepts of ousia (essentia, Wesen), physis (natura), hypostasis (substantia, Selbststand) and Person play a considerable role in the reflexive form of the Trinity. The naming of the philosophical issues in respect of trinitarian speculation shows the correlation between philosophy and theology to be evidently necessary, if the latter should endeavour to move beyond a naive reproduction of Scripture, or to avoid being caught up in mere fideism. The connection between philosophy and theology as a reflexive unity was preserved throughout the development of the Trinitarian idea in different ways. On account of the difficulties, indeed, on account of the paradox in the thought that within the trinitarian unity both difference and equality should be present, the struggle to find an orthodox concept of the Trinity inspired energetic refutations of heretical positions and formulations: primarily between a shifting ratio of unity to multiplicity, against the dominance of the One or the Other (Difference) in the Same. These generally polemical differences are marked by a group of conceptions which were all held to be heretical or 2</page><page sequence="3">W. BEIERWALTES possibly heretical (in order to maintain ecclesiastical and political unity) and thereby repressed: Subordinationism, Monarchism, Tritheism, Arianism, Sabellianism, and finally the lamentable dispute between the western and the eastern churches concerning the "Filioque" which eventually led to schism. It is not the concern of philosophy to sit in judgement upon the truth or falsehood of these conceptions, but to work out the issue at hand and the possible evidence of philosophical involvement in the matter. In the context of this long lasting 'serious game' played out between philosophy and theology in order to develop a concept of the Trinity, and as befits the occasion, I wish to turn to - among others -Eriugena. It is not least in this dimension of his thought that he can be seen as a mediator between the East and the West. In order to clarify both the difficulty and the productivity of this mediation, I shall develop the elements of Dionysius Areopagita's Trinitarianism as the presupposition for my discussion of Eriugena. Firstly, however, we must turn to a short recapitulation of the Neoplatonic conception of unity as a starting point, and the philosophical presupposition for the formation of, the theological thought (concept) of Tri-Unity. n Today it is undisputed that the philosophical structure of Dionysius' thought has its origin in Neoplatonism. This involves primarily: the ontological option of his hierarchical thought, the immanent self-realisation of the triadic principle, and the drive towards abstraction which is decisive for the 'Theologia mystica' and which plays such a great role in Neoplatonic thought about the One,3 and the form of life which is bound up with this thought.4 Since the origin of this thinking is to be limited to Proclus' exegesis of the Platonic Parmenides5, wherein he modifies and yet develops Plotinian thought, both can be employed to study the concept of the first One and its metamorphoses in relation with plurality. Both consider Unity to be at its most intensive and in its absolute form as the self sufficient Origin of reality as a whole6. In so far as this is a dimension of the Many, differentiated one from another, and yet related to each other, the origin is the One eminently. In itself it is the absolute exclusion of the Many in the sense of difference so that the lack of difference constitutes its difference from that world which it causes. Since being, being-some-thing and relationality should be thought of as forms of immanent and outwardly acting Otherness and thus implying plurality and inner and outer relations, the One is free from being, from immanent form limiting itself in relation to any other. It is without inner relationality, and thus without thought or language. It is 3</page><page sequence="4">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 'before the some-thing77 and as such nothing of all, different from all, free and unconfused, alone ITSELF, the absolute Beyond (s7reic£iva).8 Precisely on account of such an emphasis upon difference, transcendence, and nothingness, there arises for the One the paradox which withstands argumentative solution of how this relationless One could go over into a new being: that it is to say "its own" being in the form of difference and relationality. This is the fact which reason has to assume when confronted with the given structure of reality which it has to analyze, and when reason re-flects or turns back to the Origin of this very fact. This negation of being, form, some-thing, relation and thought cannot be thought of as mere emptiness or as a diminishing of reality. It should point to the very fulness of the One, identical with the Good, on the basis of whose all-mightiness9 which, as the most intensive unity and simplicity, has sublimated and embraced all difference in the manner of absolute indifference. Or rather the One does not 'have', but eminently 'is'. Thus the One or the Good gives in fact that which it does not 'have'. Therefore, the full being of the One first comes to be expressed through this paradox which attempts to present its double aspect (as one Being and Action) as one reality: It is (naturally non spatially) both nowhere and everywhere, at once all and nothing. All, because the world is through and from the One and is only because the Origin is continually active: beginning and sustaining. At the same time the One is nothing (no-thing) of all, because despite its constitutive unfolding in Being, It remains Itself absolutely: thus both in all and above all: ITSELF. On the basis of its goodness and thereby the freely giving share of Itself in Its forthgoing or emergence into being, the One sets or founds the first real otherness. This stands as relative selfhood directed towards the First and the One as the thoroughly Other: this is related to the One by virtue of the latter's immanent presence in the otherness. Thereby, and through the act of individuation and separation, the One enables the existence of plurality in the dimension of self-relationality, while yet re-flecting towards the dimension of the Origin. The "re flection" or bending-back of this dimension of Otherness and Plurality towards the founding One should be understood as the thinking of its own manifold structure. Plotinus calls this the timeless Spirit (Nous). The thinking of this Spirit is the relationality of the many, of the individual beings which are the ideas - amongst each other in a dimension per se which is nevertheless directed towards the One. Since these may be considered as the being of Spirit, the Spirit thinks in these his own being, that means: himself. As opposed to the super-essential, free from difference, relationless, non-thinking One in itself, the Nous is the "Second" as unfolded form, stage, or, in respect of the forthgoing of the One, second phase of Unity: being, in itself differentiated, 4</page><page sequence="5">W. BEIERWALTES determined through relation and through thought about itself and the One, in-itself reflexive Unity which determines and limits self as its own hypostasis. This second, in-itself-relational-One, is, in comparison with the absolute One, only analogous unity; it constitutes unity by thinking through its immanent plurality and Otherness, notwithstanding the retention of difference. By means of the unity that constitutes reflexion in the second One, likeness to the absolute One itself dominates in this realm, despite the tendency that any difference has towards its own autonomy. This form of immanently relational Thought, thinking Itself and yet reflecting towards its Origin, is the philosophical model for the Christian Unity in Tri-Unity: the Trinity. Both the above forms of unity as they were developed by Neoplatonists were introduced into a new concept of unity in the Christian Trinitarian speculation; both historically and thematically. When we consider the matter philosophically, the Christian concept of God as the Absolute and as the universal origin has its roots in the relationless transcendent One. Yet as an inwardly relational being he has his roots in the second, i.e. reflexive One, so that he could be conceived as an inner trinitarian movement of thinking, (intellectus, sapientia) speaking (verbum), willing and loving (Spiritus Sanctus).10 If it is correct to assume, as I am convinced, that Dionysius' concept of the divine one-ness is philosophically determined by the essentially distinct concepts of the absolute non-being One and the Being-One as developed in Proclus' Parmenides Commentaryn, one may be able to judge adequately the difficulties which he faced in trying to combine both with the intention of producing a concept of the Trinity which is at least approximately appropriate for the theological tradition. Ill It is within Dionysius scholarship, at least since Ferdinand Christian Baur clearly and repeatedly stated as a communis opinio, that Dionysius did not have a close affinity to the doctrine of the Trinity;12 despite particular trinitarian statements, there is, it is said, no 'explicit doctrine of the Trinity5.13 It is further argued that the Trinity is a rather alien element in his thought, and Trinitarian unity is merely 'a particular case of the metaphysical': it is the inwardly concentrated and yet outwardly creatively orientated, self-overflowing causal unity and goodness.14 Thus, the argument continues, trinitarian reductionism for Dionysius is the result of the attempt to 'legitimate himself theologically without therewith compromising himself philosophically by insisting upon three consubstantial hypostaseis of one divine being".15 The essential cause of this alleged reductionism is 5</page><page sequence="6">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 said to be Dionysius' philosophical roots in the late Neoplatonic speculation of Proclus. Within Dionysius' thought the attempt to transform the One into the Christian conception of the tri-unity or an internally unified three-ness is such a determining factor that it is certainly justified to ascribe a certain prevalence to the One. Certainly, moreover, Dionysius cannot be said to have a trinitarian "system" despite his affinity to triadic systematization as a structural principle of his thought; his thinking does not concentrate upon the innerworldly unfolding of the divine Tri-Unity in connection, let us say, with the incarnation of Christ, so that he could have been sensitive to the 'economic' aspect of the Trinity, according to which the Trinitarian Persons of the Son (Logos, Sophia) and the Holy Spirit come together effectively, constituting the world and forming the community. Yet notwithstanding this, the very fact that Dionysius thinks so emphatically in terms of the One or Unity as the highest, most powerful name for God - if the unnamable, above all names (Philippians 2,9) should indeed be named - means that Dionysius' endeavour to see the divine unity as nevertheless trinitarian, the Trinity 'derived' from the unity16, or the unity as an internally relational Trinity, deserves the utmost attention. Motivated and led -1 do not wish to say forced - by the language of Holy Scripture about Father, Son and Holy Spirit and their kinship,17 Dionysius conceives the absolute divine unity (the [!] One) also as an internally relational tri-une oneness. He thereby combines together two philosophically clearly divisible strands of thought into a unity; this unity appears - at least philosophically - paradoxical because it entails the attribution of both negativity and positivity to one and the same object. In accordance with the first hypothesis of Plato's Parmenides the eminent (first) One is absolutely transcendent with respect to all of that which thence arises - pure, superessential internally relationless Simplicity. The second form of unity, which arises from the absolute One and in self-knowledge turns back to the One, is in opposition to the First differentiated within itself; this latter unity is a web of relational being which participates in the Origin, related correlatively and subordinately in thought to itself, and related to the Origin: corresponding to the second Platonic hypothesis a 'being-One'. This allows it to receive those relational predicates which are denied the superessential One in respect of its absolute relationlessness. The putting together of both of these dimensions must be considered as intending to abolish or lessen the realm of difference between both these two forms of unity, insofar as God with all his predicates must be thought of as pure unity. Firstly, one might consider the use of all the Proclean negative predications, extended by some biblical negative predications, so that God is to be thought of as the 'superessential elevated Nothing of All'.18 In addition to this, Dionysius increases the 6</page><page sequence="7">W. BEIERWALTES absolute otherness of the divine One through the lavish use of the basically negative prefix 'super': the divine unity must be thought of as 'above' the One or 'Super-Unitary'19 in order to avoid the identification with the One as principle and element of plurality (number) and thus to distance radically the One from any kind of plurality. At the same time and - herein one sees the paradox - the implications of the 'being-One' are valid for God or the Divine Unity in just the same intensity. This is so since He who Is, which He confirmed in Exodus 3, 14 'I am that I am'20 as unchangeable Being himself (otto to evvoa) is abiding identity in himself, and yet also is difference in the sense of constituting being and giving share of his absolute goodness: He is the Cause of All;21 despite all the difference from thought in the realm of plurality: He is absolute Self-thinking,22 a thinking which embraces the ideas. The divine ideas constitute an intelligible framework of the world, before the world,23 - unitary and unifying in divine thought and they are identical with "Wisdom', 'Logos', 'Life' and 'Light' - so as to ensure congruity with Scripture. It is only by means of such a paradoxical telescoping of the superessential absolute One into a unity which in itself is differentiated and essentially relational that a reflective concept of the Trinity is possible. Given the philosophical starting point in the pure One and the tendency towards a comprehensive radical negation pointing to the absolute divine transcendence, the problematical tension in the relation between unity and trinity is barely surprising. This may, indeed, be the reason why Dionysius only suggests a process of Trinitarian self constitution and does not really analyse the properties of the forthgoing hypostaseis: neither philosophically24 nor biblically-theologically. Perhaps he said more about these matters in the 'Theological Outlines'25 which, regretfully, we do not possess. Notwithstanding the prevalence of the One as opposed to the other determinations in the whole of the Dionysian predication about the godhead, he did find a formula for the Trinity in which the dominance of the unity is suspended for the sake of a relational perichoresis of the three in a Toeing' and thinking unity. I venture to say that the linguistic chiasmus of the external elements in this formula emphasizes the unity of the three within the trinity: unified through difference and differentiated through unity, rivcouevcx tt) Biaicpioei k&lt;xi evuxjei 5iaKEKpi|L16Va.26 The threeness of the divine hypostaseis is unconfused unity which maintains the distinctive property of each (ovkeiov, i6iov); a unity, therefore, which through its immanent activity is itself. Dionysius in his concept of'unity in difference' or 'difference in unity" lays particular emphasis upon the following issue: all predications which in Scripture are about the three persons or hypostaseis or which we attribute to the incomprehensible by our own concepts should not be fixed upon one 7</page><page sequence="8">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 hypostasis but should be thought of the trinitarian godhead as a whole. Thus they are mutually connected aspects or elements of one interrelated divine being27. This is to say that the whole Godhead as Trinity is to the same degree of intensity One, Goodness, Being, Eternity, Identity, Difference, Rest, Motion, Sovereignty, Beauty, Wisdom, Thought, Life, Light, as the universal, superessential Cause (Origin or Source exuding itself) of all being28. Precisely the last mentioned characteristic of absolute Causal-Being shows that the Trinity comprehends all other named attributes in a supercategorical transcendental way, and at the same time comprehends29 the tendency 'outwards' as creative ideas or archetypes of the world, 'unified', 'unitary', or 'unifying* as Biaipeiv30 - as primal unified Trinity. This is to say a TVinity which is the origin of his unity in himself or from himself. This is the unity of the two different aspects of the same: absolute transcendence of the properties in the Godhead and the intention towards a creative unfolding, whereby the unified opposites within the origin disperse themselves into pluralities. Thus the unitary divine Being which is conceived and moved by difference and relation may be thought of as a unity of opposites. This includes the inner unfolding of the internally differentiated hypostaseis and perspectives as the One and abiding Same,31 despite his unfolding in the world. 'Opposites' characterise here not the difference of the hypostaseis as such, but their transcendent internal unifying abiding Superessence in relation to the creative emergence from Itself into an actual otherness: namely the polar determined world in which the creative power (Qsoyovov, yovifjOTri*;) derived from the divine Goodness is realised.32 The concept and reality of distinction and difference (Sidxpioig SiaKEKpipeva) of individual attributes in God is the necessary precondition for the thus understood unity of opposites and for the relational unity of the Trinity, both of which should be thought of as the whole of the Godhead. Despite his emphasis upon the unity — em twv Oextov on evajaeic; tu3v SiaKpioewv emKpaTouoi Kai 7rpoKaTdpxouai, "because in the Divine the unity rules over the difference (distinction) and it is beforehand" (i.e. before the creative unfolding),33 the distinction remains active and conscious for the reflexive grasp of the Trinity. The difference of the hypostaseis brings out the characteristic property of, primarily, one of the three34 - euSiaKpiTox; kou oactxjog Koci euraKTux;- and marks the individual identity of the three in relation to each other. Thus differentiating identity allows no inversion with each other35 (ocvnaTpo&lt;l&gt;Ti, ouk avnaTpafcei 7rp6g aXXr|Xa), no reciprocal sublimation of the particular individuality: Jesus is as the Son of the Father only himself, and not in his propriety identical with the Father: iStKooc; d(jiyw&lt;;, dauyxuTtog36 Unity pervades or combines the three particulars (each proper hypostasis) into a One which unifies the different and differentiates the unified without separating. The 8</page><page sequence="9">W. BEIERWALTES relationship of these unified-differentiated entities should be thought of as a reciprocal being-in-another37 without the one becoming the other in a part of the whole,38 and as a whole they are indeed in the other as in the whole39. The Dionysian trinitarian formula follows the maxim exactly: 'one may neither separate the unified (Sioupetv) nor confuse the distinct' (auyxeiv).40 On the one hand, the relational being-in-another of the three towards the unity or as One preserves the particular identity. On the other hand, the self-distinction of the particulars conditions and determines at once - in the self-unifying relation - the whole nature of the Godhead. At least once Dionysius points to an inner self-explication in the Trinity, a movement which springs from the Father as Principle and Source: from hence springs forth the Son and the Spirit as "from God arisen offspring and also, as it were, the blossoms and the superessential lights of the Godbegetting Godhead".41 The timeless 'theogonia'42 allows the begetting of the Son and Holy Spirit directly from the Father; a procession of the Holy Spirit43 in the sense of the Filioque according to which the Holy Spirit is not begotten by the Father, but equally by the Father and the Son (consubstantially), is not developed. The metaphors 'offspring' 'bloom' 'light' may suggest a hierarchical difference in the origination out of the source which would contradict Dionysius' conviction concerning the equal interrelatedness of the three: 'predications about each individual hypostasis are valid for the whole'. He stabilises the equality by means of predicates like unity, identity, totality, community, equally-divine and equally-good, but not with the correspondingly orthodox concept 'consubstantial'.44 Each personal characteristic in the Trinity remains in Dionysius' Trinitarian discussion relatively abstract; the inner-trinitarian being and action of the particular persons is simply mentioned in a few basic words, but not actually analysed. Also, he draws no specific significant consequences from the scriptural passages which he quotes at the beginning of the second chapter of 'De divinis nominibus'. He merely shows by drawing upon these passages that the statements for one hypostasis are valid for the whole. Only by means of such an analysis would Dionysius' stated claim concerning the 'equality' of the particulars (the particular hypostaseis) for the whole Trinity have achieved a clear contour and a persuasive power transcending that of mere postulation 45 IV Eriugena's reflective endeavour with the concept of the Trinity, attempting to seek and find coherence with Scriptural assertions about Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is not to be found concentrated in any one B 9</page><page sequence="10">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 place as is the case with St. Augustine. This is, rather, placed argumentatively within discussions about other topics, primarily in the discussion concerning the 'causae primordiales', the primordial causes. They constitute the first time-free phase of the self-unfolding of the 'principalis causa' or the 'principium sine principio' within Itself, which, identical with Verbum and Sapientia, presents the ontological presupposition for a constitution of the world as the theophany, as a "second" real unfolding of the Origin. The context of this discussion is decisive for Eriugena's own development of the Trinity. It is inappropriate to maintain that for Eriugena the Trinity has merely a 'subjective meaning'; 'merely in human consciousness'46 or is a non-obligatory, mere metaphor which evades thought.47 Eriugena discusses the Greek trinitarian formula from Dionysius, Gregory of Nazianzus and Maximus the Confessor with respect to the different terminology in comparison to the Latin or Roman conception which Augustine among others showed him. Although the linguistic differences which Eriugena emphasizes may suggest a difference in the concept, in fact they only point to different linguistic perspectives - which are partly determined by translation - but which nonetheless point to the same one thought from which the one faith lives: "Una eademque fides est in omnibus quamvis significationum diversitas videatur".48 Even though Eriugena's concept of the Trinity, especially in respect of its unity, is primarily determined by Dionysius, this in no way leads to the suppression of differentiation or distinction, or suppression of the the non-reversible characteristic nature, individuality, and each particular personality of the three. On the contrary, this influence made possible an internally differentiated, relationally-moved conception of Trinity in Eriugena. Divine unity constitutes itself as creative thinking, willing and loving threeness (in the manner of self-explication). It comprehends and preserves itself as a whole. Thus, the trinitarian unity may be understood as an internally moving and relational network which begets, creates or forms itself in an original self unfolding. This inner relationality can be understood as an abiding one; in its steadfastness it may also be questioned with regard to its inner "origin". It arises or is 'caused' through the self-unfolding of the principium (principalis causa) into that which is constituted by him - and hence as his own being. (a) The sense of the inner relationality shows itself in the reciprocal total being-in-each-other of the three through which each characteristic (proprietas)49 is not dissipated but in a distinct unity the whole Divine being first constitutes itself as steadfast motion or as moving steadfastness. It remains what It is. This is in accordance with the Dionysian thought that all predications about God's nature are 10</page><page sequence="11">W. BEIERWALTES wholly appropriate for all three in common. The following text expresses this indivisible kinship of the three to the unity in a manner which is dialectically complete: totus pater gignens in toto filio genito et totus filius genitus in toto patre gignente et totus pater gignens et totus filius genitus in toto spiritu sancto a patre per filium procedente et totus spiritus sanctus a patre per filium procedens in patre a quo procedit et filio per quem procedit, et tres unum sunt per intellectam trinitatem in unitate. - "The whole of the Father Who begets (is) the whole of the begotten Son, and the whole of the begotten Son is in the whole of the Father Who begets, and the whole of the Father who begets and the whole of the begotten Son are in the whole of the Holy Spirit Who proceeds from the Father through the Son, and the whole of the Holy Spirit Who proceeds from the Father through the Son (is) in the Father from whom He proceeds and (in) the Son through Whom He proceeds and the Three are One through the Trinity understood in unity" '.50 While the thought of the Trinitarian self-explication is developed only in a rudimentary way by Dionysius, Eriugena makes this into an essential element of his concept of the Trinity. Eriugena raises it to the absolute self-constitution of the Godhead; significantly the image of this archetype is realised imperfectly in the threefold related acts of the human spirit. (b) The thought broached here of the timeless process of the divine self-constitution finds its culmination in Eriugena's attempt to see this very aspect of the self-unfolding of the Tri-Unity in the light of the causality or being-caused: the 'infinite depth' or the 'fruitfulness' which is hidden in the Principium ("origin") proceeds as a 'causal' or as an 'essential' cause subsisting within itself (causa principalis, essentialis, substantialis)51 from itself into itself. Within this active procession it sets a second cause, which is "begotten' but in the infinite realm not less than the first, but indeed necessarily 'equal'. Thus the origin causes, begets or creates in the second cause only himself. This 'self as emerged, begotten and formed, is at once the other of the First, which is to say that the self gives himself in the second cause another propriety, different from the First and therewith also another function. According to a central text for this issue "the Father is the Cause of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, while the Son is the Cause of the creation of the causes in the Beginning, whereas the Holy Spirit is the Cause of the distribution of the same [causes]".52 This aspect of the causal self-explication for the extra-temporal and extra- spatial ("non localiter, non temporaliter")53 coming to itself of the Trinity is so significant that the trinitarian formula according to the Greek and Latin Theology is reformulated in the light of the causal 11</page><page sequence="12">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 aspect; from "una essentia in tribus substantiis (vel personis)" or "una substantia in tribus personis",54 it becomes "Essentialis causa una in tribus substantialibus causis et tres substantiates causae in una essentiali causa". - "One essential Cause in three self- subsisting Causes and three self-subsisting Causes in one essential cause." - "Una causa per se existens in tribus causis per se subsistentibus". - "One Cause arising and subsisting through himself in three self-subsisting causes".55 Theologically more specialised, speaking of the whole Trinity: "There is a substantial Cause (which is) unbegotten and begets; and there is a substantial Cause (which is) begotten and does not beget; (and) also there is a substantial Cause which proceeds and is not unbegotten nor begotten nor begetting, and the three substantial Causes are one, and one essential Cause".56 The concept of self-explication of the Trinity as a causal movement invites the danger of a lessening of Being, a subordinationist hierarchical limitation of the mightiness of the Origin. Even the saying of Jesus: "The Father is greater than I" (John 14, 28) could have been irritating. Fatherhood and Sonship are irreversible in their constitutive relationality. In opposition to the subordinationist threat, Eriugena insists that distinction and characteristic propriety do not imply a lessening of Being when they form with each other one infinite Nature which in itself is an equal-polar relationship.57 The concept of cause implies in the finite dimension a temporal and factual (ontological) priority of the cause to the caused, and hence, on account of this dependence, a certain subordination of the caused to the cause. The being of the former is lesser than that of the latter. For the 'essential cause', however, which belongs to the realm of infinitude, such a priority or precedence is unthinkable: that which language, itself a mode of difference, is forced to differentiate, is in Him, that is, in the undifferentiated In-finite, One, simultaneous (simul), equal (aequale), co-essential, co-eternal, pure identity. "All is in God God" 58 Divine in-finitude as absolute causality excludes each real degree in itself. It is before and beyond all creative opening into the world, a circle-like relatedness to itself. It is naturally already the world in the sense that as the absolute causality It sublimates and unifies in itself the manifold differentiation of the causes which were known to Eriugena from the Aristotelian tradition:59 the three substantial causes as Tri-Unity are thought of as one essential cause. Thereby the Aristotelian causal aspects and activities are telescoped into one cause: action from itself as the ('material') presupposition for a transition into the shape or 'form' of the unfolded causes ('causae primordiales', Verbum, Sapientia) is at once the beginning and the 'goal' of itself (finis as principium sui).60 I do not wish to go into controversies concerning the 'Filioque' in the question as to whether the Holy Spirit proceeds exclusively from the 12</page><page sequence="13">W. BEIERWALTES Father or the Son or from both in different ways, "from" or "out of the Father "through" the Son or from the Father and the Son in the sense of con-substantial.61 I would like merely to offer the following consideration. Eriugena takes over certain aspects from these (Greek) decisions - concerning language and subject matter - from his perspective of the Trinity as absolute causality when he asks: "Does the Holy Spirit proceed from one or two causes?"62 In order to preserve the unity of the three and to avoid a subordinationist hierarchy in spite of maintaining the characteristics (proprietates), he nevertheless prefers the Latin doctrinal position to the Greek formulas. Thus he intends no separation in two causes for the procession of the Spirit, but assumes una eademque causa. The Spirit becomes himself out of this one essential cause through the Son; "a" or "ex patre per filium" or "a patre et filio procedit", which is thoroughly compatible with the 'filioque' formula.63 With this concept of the Trinity as absolute causality which constitutes its own being as an inner interrelatedness, Eriugena seized and decisively developed in his own mode of thought the modest starting points for an inner-trinitarian theogonia64 provided by Dionysius. Since such a Trinitarian conception of causality cannot be found in Augustine,65 Boethius, Godescalc, Hincmar or Alcuin in an explicated theoretical form and in a similar systematic intensity, one tends to see precisely this aspect of Eriugena's theory as his contribution to the reflective approximation towards the Mysterium Trinitatis. Notwithstanding this, one should consider the fact that Greek theologians like Basil or Gregory of Nazianzus developed speculative theories of an inwardly dynamic Trinity more intensively than Dionysius, but these theories were not directly available as a whole to Eriugena.66 When one considers the entire development of the problem, however, the initial apparent degree of Eriugena's originality - a point of view which is rather modern - seems to be objectively lessened. Perhaps it would be even less, if it could be demonstrated that the thought about the absolute causality as the essence of the Trinity, is not merely structurally analogous to, but directly historically linked to the Trinitarian thought of Marius Victorinus,67 I have described Eriugena as a productive mediator of eastern theology to the West, and in this mediation I have also included the thought of the Trinity. Yet, it is not so much on the basis of his interpretation of the Greek trinitarian formulas - in this respect both Hilary and St. Augustine are forerunners - but rather in the acceptance, development and innovative arrangement of the Dionysian concept of the relationship between unity and trinity that I see Eriugena's productivity. Through Eriugena's grasp of this very relationship one can realize also a connection with St. Augustine's Trinitarian speculation. 13</page><page sequence="14">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 Thus in Eriugena we find an establishment of a powerful synthesis between Augustine's concept of the Trinity (which concentrates upon the immanent relationality of the Tri-Unity and the analogy of the threefold human spirit to its Divine archetype) and the eastern Dionysian tradition. This makes, on the one hand, Eriugena's concept of a Trinity as an inwardly-moved network of causal and reflective relations quite clear, while on the other, it shows why he believed that the ternars which Augustine analysed as the structure of the human mind can also be seen as yielding a differentiated insight into the Trinity itself.68 Werner Beierwaltes Institut fUr Philosophic Munich Translated by Douglas Hedley Notes 1.

We shall not discuss the third hypostasis: the psychi. The Plotinian conception of the self-reflexivity of the Nous as re-flection of that which has gone forth from the One in three phases which Proclus systematised as basic lawlikeness of the intelligible realm: remaining, emergence, reflection. Despite the levels of the self-unfolding of the One into the Nous and the Psyche, in the sense of a subordinationism, this Neoplatonic trias or the three hypostaseis were seen as a prelude or analogy to the Christian Trinity. Consider Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica XI 17, 20 and St. Augustine, De civitate Dei X 23 where he (mediated by Porphyry) refers to Plotinus' treatise V 1 'De tribus piintipalibus substantias'. Porphyry's attempt to telescope the rather sharp Plotinian distinction between both dimensions - that of the non-thinking One and the reflexively thinking Spirit - and, instead, to think of a single immanently differentiated absolute essence or super-essence may have been a more precise philosophical starting point for the Christian Trinitarian thought which excludes an immanent hierarchy.

Augustine translates the Greek formulation li'ia ouo'ia, rpeic {)7rooT(xo£ic in De trinitate V 8, 10 with 'una essentia, tres substantiae'. He uses 'substantia' and 'essentia' in a rather indiscriminate way; see trin. IX 5, 8: substantia vel essentia, or ib. 5: substantialiter, vel, ut ita dicam, essentialiter. Eriugena holds steadfastly the unambiguity and 17</page><page sequence="18">Proceedings of The Dublin Conference on Neoplatonism, 1992 distinctness of 'essentia' and 'substantia', compare II 34; 200, 17. - The classification of 'essentia' and 'persona' remained clear for Eriugena even after de praedestinatione 9, 4, as the above text demonstrates. (Courth 214 appears to dismiss or question this) - in P II 22; 90, 3f for example both concepts are used synonymously: substantiae seu personae.
