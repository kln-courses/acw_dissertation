<plain_text><page sequence="1">Where Do We Go from Here? Scenarios for the Psychology of Religion* PAUL W. PRUYSERt As the discipline of psychology has become enormously diversified in this century, a great diversity of psychologies of religion has become possible and up to a point been demonstrated. Even more importantly, one can now see marked differences in the apparent motives and aims whereby psychologies of religion have been produced, with the result that partial, competing, and parochial views abound and a comprehensive psychology of religion is still a long way off. In this situation it is crucial to agree on criteria that guarantee perspectival integrity in the discipline of psychology of religion. Some basic guidelines are offered. In addition, some suggestions are made for needed new studies and approaches, including the developing of heuristically rich typologies, and a concentration on religion in aging persons and the dying, in some of whom dogmatic or ritualistic religiosity may have given way to a non-conflictual atheistic ethical and existential concern. The first and obvious thing to say at this annual meeting of the American Psychological Association is that psychology has become so diversified and subspecialized that it makes ever less sense to continue to speak of psychology of religion as if it were one enterprise. There may be nearly as many psychologies of religion as there are APA divisions and branches of psychology - each being a special view of the thing purportedly studied: rligion. For instance, there are several social-psychological views, several behavioral views, several cognitive views. There is a classical psychodynamic, an ego-psychological, a British objective-relations view. One can distinguish a elinical psychological view, a pastoral psychological view, a para-psychological view, an organizational behavior view, a life-course developmental view, a stress and crisis view and much more. Maybe there is even a military psychology of religion being pursued somewhere in the Pentagon! The second obvious thing to say is a complement of the first one: the phenomena of religion, i.e., what is being studied by any of the psychologies of religion, are also so diverse and often so systematized in their diversity, that we should no longer speak of religion at large, but of specific religions, faith groups, denominations, sects, cults, or individuals, perhaps even further qunlified by adjectives such as liberal, orthodox, findamentalist, evangelical, Hindu, Shiite, Sunni, capitalist, Marxist, anabaptist, militant, pietistic, established, in free-church tradition, or what not. For should we not expect *This article was first presented as an invited lecture at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C., August 1986.

What I am describing here is diversity in the workings and forms of psychologies and of religions - in some cases such a pronounced diversity that a comprehensive psychology of religion is very difficult to attain. But there is also an attitudinal factor in some scholars who do not even strive toward comprehensiveness because they are ill at ease with pluralism as a philosophical principle and a political stance. Both of these grant diversity not only its right to exist and be manifest, but approach the diverse positions with tolerance, though not without judgment. Such tolerance is simply too much for some minds. MOTIVES AND AIMS IN PSYCHOLOGIES OF RELIGION At any rate, given the diversity of psychologies and the almost bewildering multiformity of religious phenomena, it is small wonder that there are marked differences also in what appears to motivate scholars to engage in psychology of religion and in the aims that their works are to serve. Let me briefly articulate some motives and aims that no one can miss when surveying a sizeable portion of the accumulated literature. I spot at least the following positions:1 1. Some psychologies of religion seek to buttress religion or to defend it apologetically by trying to describe, if not prove, its psychological necessity or inevitability. While this can be done with sophistication, it is often done naively, for instance by trying to show that mental health or stable human relations rest on engagements in religion, either the writer's pieferred religion or just any religion or piety. There are numerous sub-scholarly tracts of this ilk, and because of the often half-literate popular conservatism that spawns a good part of them, they ironically deal more often with a vague attitude of genteel religiousness than with the specifics of a particular persuasion. 2. Some psychologies of religion seek to make subjective and private experiences objective and public by providing them with psychological understanding, fine description, or explanations. Works on mysticism tend to have this aim. They seek to articulate what is alleged to be ineffable and are, as Rudolf Otto once observed, sometimes unusually wordy in conveying the sacred silence of their subject matter. Some studies of mystical experience go further than describing and explaining and frankly advocate para-normal experiences - no matter how induced, to what end, and at what possible psychic cost. 3. Some psychologies of religion seize upon strange, rare, deviant, controversial, or sectarian practices, for instance glossolalia, ecstasy, or hallucinatory states, which are 1. Some material from this section is derived from my article "Psychology of religion as an academic subject: Its challenge to scholarship and pedagogical impact." Religion, Journal of Kansas School of Religion at the University of Kansas 14 (2): 1-4, 1977. 174</page><page sequence="3">SCENARIOS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION seen by others as abnormal or are generally disdained, so as to bring them within the range of normal or adaptive processes, making them not only understandable, but also acceptable and possibly even respectable. They form a complement to other studies of the same phenomena that set out to show how pathological they are. 4. Some of the other psychologies of religion clearly aim at exposing religion as a whole as an atavism or anachronism by focusing on its archaic origins, its continuous anachronistic practices, its primitive modes of thought and action, the thought control it fosters, or the unreason on which it is allegedly based Metapsychological or metaphysical postures behind these endeavors include a by now somewhat dated hyper-positivism, hyper- rationalism, and ill-conceived developmentalism. 5. In contrast to the previous endeavor, some psychologies of religion appear to have been written in order to expose with benign fascination the psychic roots of religion in archaic imagery of childish wishes or defense mechanisms, so as to maximize the continuities between ancient and modern man, or between child and adult. This kind of work is often embedded in, or in turns fosters, an encompassing, but probably quite syncretistic, general psychology or transhistorical world view. 6. A rarer form of psychology of religion seeks to apply, in playful tinkering fashion, the conceptual and operational apparatus of a particular psychology (e.g., clinical, experimental, social) to one or more of the many phenomena of religion, just to see where these would lead in understanding religion, with minimal prejudice from personal agendas. For some minds, this enterprise can be reinforced by the conviction that religion has long been a taboo subject for scientific investigation, and that the time has come to break this taboo. For other minds the very richness of religious phenomena, their subtlety, and their seeming intractability are challenging them to do this kind of investigating in an intellectually joyous spirit. 7. Often mixed with one of the other positions is an approach that pays respect to religion's historical persistence, its power, its impact on individuals and groups, and its richness of forms by bestowing great curiosity upon it, in a nonpartisan spirit, but with a no holds barred analysis. My list is not a classification of works, but an inventory of apparent aims and motives that have produced the body of literature on psychology of religion. One writer can have several aims and motives at once, or change in the course of time from one to the other. In addition to these aims and motives we should be aware of the possibility that in some intellectuals with critical and analytical minds their engagement in psychology of religion is a substitute for, or a once-removed form of engagement in religious thought, or an intellectuilized expression of loyalty to their religious origins or affiliation. Moreover, psychologists who prize introspection may find themselves constructing half- experimentally certain forms of intense involvement in religion that would provide grounds for psychological reflection, e.g., trying to speak in tongues or taking psychedelic drugs. Or in searching for psychological clarification they may engage in religious practices or strive for religious experiences, e.g., by meditating, fasting, or attending mass evangplizing meetings, legitimating their acts by their scholarly ambition. In a word, there are ample opportunities for mixed motives to operate in studying psychology of religion. Given the diversities that I have sketched, it should not surprise anyone that scholars in the psychology of religion tend to form little cliques based on similarity in preferred 175</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION psychological theory, method of study, professional setting, motive, and aim, and not infrequently on shared denominational or sectarian allegiances. Many scholars pay little attention to works produced outside their own clique, and broad cross-referencing leaves much to be desired in the bibliographies of books and articles. To put it more sharply, I find there is a great deal of parochialism which in its way undermines the viability of the phrase "psychology of religion." PERSPECTIVAL INTEGRITY IN THE STUDY OF RELIGION In academic settings there is considerable variability and sometimes inter- departmental bickering about the proper auspices for courses in the psychology of religion. In some cases these courses are taught in psychology departments and by psychologists, in other cases in departments of religion by faculty members who may or may not be psychologists. In either case the offering of a course appears to be quite dependent on the fortuitous availability of a faculty member who has an interest in the subject - an interest which is not always a guarantee of adequate mastery of the subject. Further complications are produced by divinity schools and theological seminaries which usually have no formal psychology departments with the kind and degree of autonomy and spectrum of interests these departments would have in the graduate schools. And still other complications occur when psychology of religion courses are taught in church- sponsored or sectarian colleges; in that case I worry about the level of grasp that can be expected from students who know very little psychology and are simply not old enough and are possibly too narrowly indoctrinated to know much about religion either. In that case the level of instruction and of assigned textbooks is likely to be commensurably low. Among the several hidden assumptions that are apt to lie behind each arrangement I would like to focus on some that have formal implications for the integrity of psychology of religion as a branch of psychology as well as for guaranteeing a minimal adequacy in representing the scope and depth of religion which is its subject matter. Most organized scholarly domains are a distinct combination of one or more basic sciences, ancillary sciences, and applied sciences, and sometimes of techniques or skills, and any discipline is usually distinguishable from others by an evolved, unique language game. Using this formal schema and opposing from the start any complete fusion or blatantly syncretistic mixtures, I suggest that the disciplines of psychology and of religion can function vis-a-vis one another in the first place as ancillary sciences. Knowledge of humankind's ongoing engagement in religion and the world's literature about it can be helpful in the formation of learned and astute psychologists, if only because of the amount and variety of soul-searching that religion has traditionally fostered as well as the large margin of pathology it has always produced. Conversely, psychology's questions and findings about how minds work, how feelings affect cognition and how thoughts entail feelings, how behavior is motivated and shaped, etc. can hardly be ignored today by religionists with scholarly ambition and a sense of intellectual responsibility. But in either case, the ancillary discipline is to be kept in a subordinate position as a safeguard against identity confusion. Moreover, the moment one accepts the rationale for such a mutually ancillary role at the scholarly level, questions of selectivity and specificity arise, derived from both the 176</page><page sequence="5">SCENARIOS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION pluralistic situation I described earlier and the parochialism I noted. What kind of psychology is defensibly ancillary to what kind of religion, and vice versa? Though this question is rarely explicitly raised, it has in practice been answered in strikingly different ways, as my brief inventory of positions has already shown. In addition to a mutually ancillary role, psychology and religion can function vis-a- vis each other at the applied science level and in relation to techniques and skills. Barring again syncretism and fusion, it can be said that clinical psychology and counseling practitioners can benefit from knowing how religious practitioners make their melioristic interventions in the lives of troubled people, and how religionists assess their charges' behavior, thoughts, feelings, or needs. Reciprocally, professional religionists can benefit from studying how applied psychologists make their assessments of people's needs and make their melioristic interventions. It must be said that the clinical pastoral education movement has done the latter kind of exploring with great eagerness and thoroughness, whereas psychologists have not shown much interest in the reciprocal exploration. Does it follow, then, that perspectival integrity in either of the two disciplines is vouchsafed by the choice one makes between them at the basic science level, fortified by the language game one adopts along with that choice? I am inclined to say roundly, Yes to this question, were it not for a few added considerations. Surely a psychologist should be identified with psychology and its vocabulary and grammar, no matter what special topic he or she studies. And surely a religionist should be grounded in divinity studies and use its parlance no matter what interest may lead him or her to pursue psychology. But even so, there are complications on the horizon that may come to present problems. The first complication is methodological and epistemological. What conceptual outlook, what categories, what theoretical framework should guide the psychologist studying religion? If one looks at the accumulated literature one will find that the vast majority of psychological studies of religion have been topically organized by the categories of religion itself, or by religious designations of religious experience. In other words, the subject matter has largely determined the points of focus and organization of the textbooks, such as conversion, mysticism, idea of God, types and stages of faith, prayer, worship, confession, the sick soul, etc. My own 1968 work A Dynamic Psychology of Religion was the first one to break with this surrender to the dictates of religion, and to use instead a large collection of psychological processes as means to address, describe and evaluate the many phenomena of religion. The fact that this feature of my work has found few if any imitators suggests that the psychology of religion is still dominated by the religious scene, if not by overt or covert religiosity, and has insufficiently asserted its autonomy and integrity as a psychology. I am well aware that the psychology of anything, say of art, literature, mass behavior, gender, work, play, or small groups, must take the natural articulations of its subject matter into account. But it has to place its subject matter in a perspective that is and remains psychological, or else it is no longer a psychology of the subject matter in question. In the case at hand, religion is metaphorically speaking to be looked at through psychological eyes or glasses, palpated by psychological fingers, listened to by psychological ears, and smelled by psychological noses. It is to be thought about in psychological terms. To do this kind of perspectival exploring with any degree of thoroughness one needs to be quite conversant with religion and be aware of its many 177</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION fascinating phenomena, but without identifying oneself with its ontological and epistemological assertions. Especially when the psychologist has a denominational commitment and is a participant in the phenomena studied, he or she must be on guard against slipping from psychological into religious considerations. I have now used a word, commitment, that presses for caution in some scholars and for boldness in others, based on how they rank the disciplines of psychology and religion in order of their respective comprehensiveness, truth character, ultimacy as foundational discipline, or teleological value. With which of the two disciplines or human enterprises is one most deeply identified, or which one does one take as vantage point while purporting to do a psychological study of religion? Is it possible to take both psychology and religion at once, in one act of combined thinking, as basic sciences? The fact is that there are not a few scholars and professionals today who have advanced degrees in both disciplines. And among those there are some who have come to their two academic degrees because they have perceived - rightly or wrongly - a certain affinity between the discipline of psychology and the discipline of religion, and in some cases wish to make soul mates between these two human enterprises. I think that these situations require extraordinary vigilance and a great deal of self- control if the resultant work is to be a perspectivally intact psychology of religion. As Vitz has indicated, some psychologies parade or are seen by their adherents as quasi- religions, and as James showed many years ago, some religions parade as quasi- psychologies, especially those with a pronounced healing cult. It is but a few small steps to move from sensing some affinity to espousing syncretism or even advocating fusion. And as must have been clear from my presentation thus far, I think that neither psychology nor religion is served by such inadequate thought patterns. Nor, for that matter, is the catechumen, counselee, psychotherapy patient, novice in religious orders, or aspiring believer served by such mixings. The Jesuit novice is not taken through the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises to become healthy or wise, but to become firm in his incarnational Christian faith; the mental patient with delusions of grandeur is not to be strengthened in his belief that he is a son of God, but led to accept the surpassing power of reality and the limitations of being human. SUGGESTIONS FOR NEEDED STUDIES Continuing the psychodynamic, ego-psychological, and introspective orientations that have characterized my previous work, but being open to a variety of study methods ranging from observing and interviewing to measuring, I would now like to make some suggestions for topical studies that could bring new fascination and depth to the psychology of religion. Leaning on a classical reflection about projection made by Feuerbach and Freud and many others, I would like to see studies done on aspects of religious experience and attitudes in aging people and old folks. To put Feuerbach's and Freud's thesis in a nutshell if personality development implies emancipation from childhood needs and an increasing awareness of one's own projections, one would expect that some people's notions of deity will shed their anthropomorphic features or will be replaced entirely by a more abstract principle of cosmic creativity, ethical value, or ultimate truth. In such people, religion of childhood may become an ethic of maturity as they take back their previous projections. Their religiousness may become atheistic in the sense that they no longer feel impelled 178</page><page sequence="7">SCENARIOS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION to pay homage to a quasi-human God in worship and prayer. Such an atheism is not conflict-ridden, strident, or bellicose, and the person's previous more traditional religiousness is not necessarily disowned; in fact, the person may now have a benign, slightly bemused attitude towards fantasies and feelings, ritual acts, and various obligations in which he or she used to engage with the same sincerity that typifies the present abstinence from such observances. I have seen this special kind of emancipation happen in some of my aging friends. Moreover, from introspective self-study I must affirm that something like this process has slowly and steadily been happening to me and from impressionistic observations of old people in hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices and from conversations with their attending caretakers, including chaplains, one learns that there appears to be a bipolar distribution of religiousness in the aged and dying some becoming more intensely or articulately religious than they were before, and others becoming less involved than they were. Moreover, despite the adage that there are no unbelievers in fox holes, I have long been impressed by the frequent absence of any religious allusions, imagery, or feelings in many people's self-accounts of traumatic situations, their dreams around important events, and their responses to life crises - even in those persons who have a denominational affiliation, know religious language, and have had religious training - prople whom one would expect to experience such events religiously. What is one to make of these loose but trenchant impressions? Do some people "outgrow" religion after having embraced it? Is there a developmental or dialectic dynamic in religion itself that moves from more or less anthropomorphic theistic imagery to impersonal or atheistic conceptions? Have the accumulated data of the psychology of religion been skewed by disproportionate preoccupation with college students, children, and early life stages? Have we focused too much on people's images and conceptions of God and neglected to study their world views and ethos? These questions are enough to indicate that we are dealing with a complex but interesting issue that can be approached from many different sides. A second study topic that I like to see addressed is based on the observation that many bright, well educated, and articulate persons who have reached rather high levels of intellectual, technical, professional, or artistic development appear to be singularly undeveloped in their religious ideas and beliefs. Some of these cases show a noticeable disparity in cognitive achievement levels and articulateness, with startlingly low competence in religion. These persons appear to maintain a stylized stupidity, primitivity, naivete, or dull-wittedness in religious matters, much as a country may maintain a nature preserve or National Park area in an otherwise developed or industrialized region. Anyone who has attempted to teach adult church school classes with a high proportion of college educated or professional members can make this interesting if shocking observation. What can account for such disparity in which religion in church affiliated persons comes off worst? Is it a personal selectivity based on conflict with parental teachings, early religious indoctrination, or painful disenchantments? Is it lack of interest due to lack of received stimulation and guidance? Is it a perverse (but possibly quite widespread) form of piety that anxiously clings to the Biblical verse: ... "Unless you turn and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (Mt. 18:3 RSV)? Or is this situation the expression of a special quality that some critics have considered to be unique to religion itself, namely its indulgence of childish wishes and its readiness to gratify almost 179</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION any primitive prompting - in other words, its failure to be a sublimation? Is religion, even among the educated and intellectually ambitious, a favorite and socially sanctioned area of stagnation, fixation, or regression? We need well-documented answers to these questions. A third recommendation I wish to make has to do with typology. Much use has been made and continues to be made of two old war horses, one a typology of religious experience, the other a typology of religious behavior. I hardly need to say that the first one is William James's elaboration of Francis Newman's distinction between once-born and twice-born believers; and the second is Gordon Allport's distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic religion. Both happen to be bipolar typologies and have for good reasons been used so much that they may have drained attention away from other deserving ordering schemes. Religious phenomena are so varied and many that surely several worthwhile distinctions can be made between them. For instance, the types of religious experience formulated in 1965 by Erwin Goodenough have excellent face validity and in my opinion combine rather nicely a psychological with a church-historical and religious-studies perspective. Goodenough's sophisticated definitions and apt descriptions add up to the following typological list: 1) Legalism; 2) Supralegalism; 3) Orthodoxy; 4) Supraorthodoxy; 5) Aestheticism; 6) Symbolism and Sacramentalism; 7) The Church; 8) Conversion; and 9) Mysticism. To the best of my knowledge, Goodenough's typology has not found many users, which is puzzling because it is not only very articulate and well-defined, but also an ecumenical typology that reflects the author's knowledge of world religions. I hope that Goodenough's work will be rescued from its apparent oblivion and will become belatedly appreciated for the seminal work it is. After all, much of its ideational structure derives from two giants, Rudolf Otto and Sigmund Freud, whose concepts of the mysterium tremendum and of the dynamic unconscious respectively should serve the psychology of religion for at least another fifty years. But as my previous statements on perspectival integrity imply, psychologists have the option and may indeed prefer to group their observations in terms of psychological variables operating in the religious life rather than in terms of how religion itself articulates its forms. Most of Goodenough's categories are classical terms in divinity studies rather than chapter headings in psychology textbooks. In distinction but not strong opposition to this approach, I have become intrigued by the possible usefulness to the psychology of religion of Bernard Lonergan's finely honed analysis of cognitive processes and decision making in his book Insight: A Study of Human Understanding (1957). In a nutshell, Lonergan, a Jesuit theologian with a respectable grasp of psychology, has dug deeply into the part processes that operate in human knowing, including those aspects of knowing that overlap with faith. Lonergan's first act or level of consciousness consists in experiencing; his second act or level is a kind of probing or hypothesis forming about that experience which he calls understanding; and the third act consists of judgment. Judgment involves for Lonergan a critical review of the experiential and contextual data in combination with a critical evaluation of one's own thought processes in terms of their assumptions, proclivities, biases, etc. - in other words, with a critical view of oneself as knower of the experience. In this way, a person arrives at the meaning of an experience for himself or herself, while also being attuned to the objective referent of the experience. A fourth act or level of consciousness consists in a move from cognition to the conative 180</page><page sequence="9">SCENARIOS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION and emotional or attitudinal functions: the making of decisions for action, commitment, and ethical stances and for doing so with the elan and passionate feeling that we typically encounter in the state of being in love. These are only the bare bones, in my reconstruction, of Lonergan's very difficult but eye-opening text. It seems to me that the distinctions between the part processes of knowing, acting and loving thus described (by a thinker who is well aware of the power of unconscious thought) give us a set of benchmarks for types of religiosity, especially in terms of arrest at certain points of a noetic process that is meant to be unifying but in many people fails in this aim. We all know people who experience the world or themselves without being interested in understanding their experiences, let alone bring their understanding to the critical test of judgment. And we also know people who stop at judgment and fail to move from knowing to praxis, let alone to that bubbly and hearty form of praxis that deserves to be called loving. I hope I am beginning to win you over to the view that there are many other fascinating psychological features of religion besides conversion and whether it is a gradual or an abrupt process, and the question whether anybody's religiosity is intrinsic or extrinsic. Religion is complex enough to deserve attention to other details, and psychology is capable enough to approach at least some of these as yet unattended details with its many conceptual tools. In my own most recent work The Play of the Imagination (1983), I consider all great cultural domains such as literature, the arts, science, music, and religion as illusionistic in the special sense of being neither solipsistically autistic nor naturalistically real, but symbolic in a shareable, corporate way. One needs cognitive development and formal Feucation to come to feel at home with what goes on in these vast cultural symbol systems. We need to be and usually are tutored to gain skill in such illusion processing. In this vein, I want to end up with two questions for you to ponder: 1) How do people process the illusionistic images and propositions of religion that their culture, denomination, or faith group hands down to them? 2) Can a typology of such processing be developed that honors both the integrity and capability of psychology and the intricacy of religion?
