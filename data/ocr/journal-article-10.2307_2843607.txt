<plain_text><page sequence="1">171 OBSERVATIONS ON SOME ASPECTS OF RELIGION AMONG THE AZANDE (" NIAM-NIAM ") OF EQUATORIAL AFRICA. By CAPTAIN J. E. T. PHILIPPS, M.C. FOREWORD. THE Zande is by the Dinka nicknamed Niam-niam, and the people became conse- quently known to the Arab slavers, who reached them through Dinka-land, as Niam- niamawi. Niam-niam is a term subsequently and loosely applied by Sudan Arabs and Egyptians to all Africans who were believed to practise cannibalism. Lin- guistically Pa Zande is Sudanic but not Nilotic. In a public lecture in January, 1918, the late Pere van den Plas, a careful student of the Azande, estimated their numbers as " between three and four million " souls. Their area of dispersal stretches roughly from the Nile (the Makaraka- Zande of the Rejaf-Yei district) to the River Congo towards Bumba. The Zande confederation is found in operation in: (1) The Uele districts of the Belgian Congo,' where the main body is located; (2) In the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, where two Bantu tribes, BaGuru and BaHima are still in process of being Zandeised; and (3) In the Ubangi-Shari Colony of French Equatorial Africa, which is the door through which they poured into the other two. The term Zande is not here applied indiscriminately to all tribal units that are members of the Zande confederation, nor to all those under the political hegemony of the Vongara ruling caste, who find it chic to call themselves Azande because they speak the Zande tongue. Zande in these notes refers exclusively to people fully Zandeised or of Zande blood. It must be postulated that customary procedure is now beginning to vary widely in practice, though little as yet in theory or tradition. 1 Monseigneur Lagae, in the course of conversation last year, informed me that the Vongara Ukw3, son of Wando, defeated the Mamvu (a group then being organized by the aristocratic Mangbetu family), and reached the Bomokandi about 1885. The Zandeised Bantu tribe, named by their Avongara " Akare " (strangers), are in the French territory.</page><page sequence="2">172 J. E. T. PHILIPPS.-Observations on some Aspects of The great area over which the Zande influence is spread and the local reactions within it of the cults of alien tribes incompletely (though still being) Zandeised, and the effect of comparatively recent separation of the confederation into three uncommunicating divisions, submitted to three totally diflerent native policies, is inevitably contributing to increased divergence of native custom. Such elementary observations as are here set down have been made during three journeys in Zande-land (with the help of a knowledge of the Zande language), namely: Firstly in French Equatorial Africa in 1921; Secondly in the Belgian Congo in 1921 and 1924; Thirdly in the Sudan for eight months near both the French and Belgian borders. Of these three Zande groups, which in the eyes of the Zande citizen still constitute only one, the Belgian Azande, who have the purest blood, are by far the most sophisti- cated and modernized. These notes have been made rather by direct observation, ocular and aural, of pagan Azande speaking no language but their own, than by any system of enquiry or questioning. Such a method, while slow and not producing such pleasantly coherent or voluminous material, has a certain advantage in recording only the results of the quiet observation of spontaneous actions in their natural setting. I have found, generally speaking, that Azande who have come under, or been in contact with, Christian or Moslem influence are rather misleading than otherwise. Being led to believe their newly acquired faith to be " the only religion," they tend to despise their pagan brethren as destined to eternal fire. They are apt to render, especially to Christian or Moslem missionaries, any statement of tribal religious practices in terms of their newly acquired beliefs by wrenching ancestral practices from their own setting into whatever they may regard as that of the questioner; by which they imagine, with all goodwill, that they are showing proof of both polite- ness and intelligence. Being very conscious of my own lack of training for such work, I have preferred the slow method of simple observation which is less susceptible of misinterpretation by either informants or myself.</page><page sequence="3">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 173 THE AZANDE.

Spirits, Malignant (Agilisa)2 ... 183 1. THE SUPREME BEING (Mboli). The existence of a Supreme Being known as Mboli, or among the Zande out- landers of the Sudan as Mbori, is universally recognized and accepted by the Zande people. Mboli makes himself felt to the Zande in every phase of his daily activities. He is not, as are so many African deities, so much a-god-to-be-propitiated. He is rather to be prayed to in order to avert evil, inflictable or in4flicted by spirits. His is a " Fixed power divine which moves to good," though haltingly. His general tendency is felt to be benignant. But if he is slow to anger he is slow also to good. His response to prayer is sluggish. He needs to be constantly reminded of the good disposition or merit of the human individual in order that his benignant potentialities inay be stimulated and put into action on the individual's behalf. But, woe betide the Zande who calls casually or overweeningly to the Supreme Being, or who represents himself to be practising virtues or merits which he does not in reality possess. Hence it is to their negative virtues that would-be supplicants most frequently draw attention in protestation or in prayer. Mboli appreciates the moral virtues as they are conceived by the community,. who feel themselves consciously to be beneath his ubiquitous and absolute dominion. He intervenes frequently in daily life to chastise vi/3ptq by the stroke of illness, or to loose the bolts of death upon those who have neglected or inadvertently laid shame upon the manes of their clan. No trace of any anthropomorphic conception of Mboli has come before my notice. Nor is any Zande believed to have seen the Supreme Being incarnated under any guise. The usufruct of earth, air, fire, water and the animals of the chase are consciously held to be conceded to man by Mboli, whom the majority of Azande consider to have caused them to be brought into existence. Among Azande completely ignorant of European or Arab usage, I have not been able to remark any idea of a specific dwelling-place of the Supreme Being, nor any conception of a celestial or chthonic abode of the disembodied dead. One would 1 J follow Tylor, Primitive Culture, in the use of the terms soul, ghost, and spirit. 2 Agilisa is the purer pronunciation which becomes agirisa according to territory and dialect, especially in the French and Sudan areas.</page><page sequence="4">174 J. E. T. PHILIPPS.-Observations on some Aspects of naturally not base upon this merely negative result a denial of the possibility of existence of such conceptions. I have had eager and even elaborate pictures of such ideas offered to mie by Christian and Moslem Azande, but among untravelled villagers I have not been able actually to observe any such formulated ideas. The Zande would appear to feel a conscience (whether clear or sinful) in regard to Mboli. During the sudden and devastating thunderstorms and tornadoes which sweep along the Congo-Nile Divide and down the valleys of the Ubangi and the Uele, the people in the fields will gladly seek the fly of a stranger's tent, or huddle with him in a friendly hut. One may observe thus at one's ease an alarmed and unselfconscious crowd. In the short silence which follows some particularly earth-shaking crash of thunder, one may frequently hear a voice from among the crouching figures invoking protection of Mboli against the Gumba, or lightning-beast, that strikes with the "blinding death." The voice or prayer protests audibly but quietly its innocence of offences held to be repugnant to Mboli or likely to attract a physical manifestation of his dis- pleasure, at whose leash the dreaded Gumba ever strains, at whose nod it is released.' The remarks actually reproduced are those most frequently overheard in the mouths of different Azande on some dozen occasions. Mi adinga ga boro ahe te- " I have not stolen things of any man." Ga Mboli pai du !-" Mboli's affair it is! " Ka Mboli aidanga te, ka mi kpinga haleme ya !-" If Mboli doth not desire it (then) let me not die to-day ! " From a moral and political standpoint the influence of Mboli may generally be said to be a healthy one. There exist to my knowledge no legends regarding Mboli which would lead one to classify him in the lower grade of apotheosized heroes such as exist among the agricultural Baganda or the pastoral Hirna peoples. The whimsical and popular national hero of the Zande is Tule'. Tule' could perhaps best be described as " a card." The collection of the Asangbwa Tule' or tales of Tuhle form the daily fairy-tale literature of the people. His position nearly corresponds to that of Kabundji of the Lulua, whose stories I have heard with delight over camp-fires in the Kasai. Neither names have fear or reverence, though they may have a tolerant admiration, attached to their characters. Indeed, the very mention of -their names brings an expectant smiile to the lips of the people, who always hope to hear some sly new exploit or fantasy about them. 1 In the Zande language, similes and picturesque imagery are very frequently derived from the use of dogs in hunting and of spears in war. Indeed the Azande often actually say: Gumba du ko-yo du Mboli ni, wa gako ango-- The lightning is there where Mboli is, as if his doo."</page><page sequence="5">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 175 The position of Mboli among the Azande is rather comparable to that of the Supreme Being Irmnna among the peoples of Ruanda.1 Few deaths are due to natural causes. But Mboli often causes or permits death to supervene. Against Mboli no magic may avail. But, first, divination must be in- voked to ascertain whether death be due to an evil-eye of the ill-disposed. If the reply be negative and no indications against the living are announced, then the death must be accepted with resignation. " Mboli has let the heart-beats fade." Ko hingi-they say-bangiliko bili-" He is lost, . . . his eyes are blackened (i.e. obscured)." Or Ko gafwe tope-" He is returned (to earth) behind the spade (the hoe, the hole-maker)." The Zande speaks of human death in periphrases. He seldom employs the bald term kpyo, " death," and never in reference to his own relatives. Ko nyesi, "he is finished." Mboli has let the heart-beats fade, but he has galvanized the dormant soul into activity. He has taken it forth into the ambient spirit-world, active and invisible. Henceforth the soul is an entity to be reckoned with. It is beginning its period of real activity. Previously it could be kept in order by the family and neighbours through the tangible and controllable body in which it dwelt. Mboli alone can be sure of controlling it now. Mboli appears to be continually present in the Zande subconsciousness. Nay, the idea of the presence of Mboli seems to hover at the edge of the Zande consciousness more strongly than that of the occasional, though dreaded, spirits who, though more acutely active, appear to fill only a secondary role in Zande life. In peasant genealogies, vaguely dating back over nearly two centuries, combina- tions of the word Mboli crop up frequently in family names. Ga-Mboli-Pai (of god-affair). Mboli-Mangi-le (god-made-me). Cf. Ganda, Na-Katonda-Yankola (mother-god-made-me), and compounds of Asapani in some Mangbetu nicknames. The small point concerning the early date of the occurrence of Mboli in tribal names is only mentioned here because in some African countries the promotion of a relatively unimportant member of the heroic or spirit hierarchy to do service for the idea of a Christian god has recently produced a temporary crop of modern (usually female) names compounded with that of the favoured hero, thus creating a fictitio-us idea of his real place in the tribal religion. The reverence and respect shown to Mboli appear to be universal, anad to date from a period considerably anterior to European occtipation. Zande Practice of the Cult of the Supreme Deity. Prayer.-Professional rain-makers, as they are understood among many Nilotic tribes, do not exist among the Azande. Prayers are addressed to ' See Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, April, 1923. Article on " Mufumbiro: the Birunga Volcanoes of Kigezi-Ruanda-Kivu ": section on "Religion."</page><page sequence="6">176 J. E. T. PHILIPPS.-Observations on some Aspects of Mboli, acconmpanied in grave cases by communal oflerings, in times of prolonged drought. Graven images of man of magico-religious significance are not made by the Azande, with the exception of the secret society of the Im&amp;ni, which is of foreign origin and produces, for specific and secular purposes, small wooden doll-like images. I have also seen rare specimens of these in ivory, specially designed for chiefs, and sometimes also in clay for women. Many houses, however, possess external mural decorations consisting of human figures representing friends or notables in quite good perspective and tasteful colouring. These possess no religious significance. The audible use of prayer to the Supreme Being is more frequent among the Azande than among any African race of whom I have direct or indirect knowledge. I would hazard the opinion that the average untravelled Zande of the bush seldom passes a day of his life without a spoken prayer to Mboli. The true Zande is by nature a clean creature. He washes usually twice a day. He does not live in village ,communities, buqt isolated in individual families in the bush. "Le Zande," says Beaufaict (1915), "a l'horreur des agglome'rations. Chacun vit isole avec sa famille." The usual site is on a slope in the shade of big trees which fringe the numerous tributaries of the Uele-Congo, the Sueh-Nile and the Mbomu-Ubangi. (Such a -combination of shade and water has facilitated the infection and eastward spread of the Tsetse palpalis which has been decimating the central Azande for the past ten years.) Living with water at his door, and offering up a prayer very frequently after his ablutions, it is not surprising that the motions of his prayer should be connected with his last act of habitual ablution, namely, the cleansing of his mouth with water. He takes a mouthful of water, drinking from his hands. He expectorates it on the ground near by, using one of the many variable formulhe according to occasion. One may cite a typical prayer which one very frequently hears if one sits and smokes -a pipe unobtrusively with them by a twilight fire. Bangile aboro wene nga yo -dunduko. Kina lo, Mboli, nikasapa ga aboro gbwanga ni lengo-" In my eyes all men are just (to me). Verily it is thou, Mboli, who art a judge over us." That is, " I hate no man, I am not a disturber of my brethren's peace." He calls Mboli to witness: " I hate no man. I am not a disturber of my brethren's peace. 0 Mboli, -thou art my judge and witness. Let no evil come to me from ill-disposed men or spirits." Again, a few months ago, I was travelling on foot some seven days from Doruma ,(Sultan Ndorumo) to Dungu (Uele) with nine Azande conscripts for the Moto gold- mines. Though labour conditions in Moto are good, the lads were very depressed at the prospect of three months' hard labour outside their tribal area, that is, in what was to them a foreign land. After crossing a river of any size, they washed and, filling their mouths with water, spat it out groundwards in a shower, and each in turn .said with a quiet and simple reverence: Mboli, ka mi kpinga ku watsa yo ya !</page><page sequence="7">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 177 "Mboli, may I not perish in Watsaland!" (Watsa is the distributing centre for the Moto mines.) No shrines, altars, or sacrifices are made to Mboli. Such appear reserved for ceremonies of propitiation to the lesser lights of the hierarchy, the disembodied spirits. One may, however, see at times, usually early in the dry season, that is at the time of the opening of the staple harvest, fruits and crops in little bundles, apparently individual gifts, left out to rot en masse upon the bare rock surface of the great limonite outcrops which are a conspicuous feature of Zande-land. Such an apparent waste of food before the season of plenty is fully come cannot fail to attract the attention of the most casual passer-by. It is thus that one of the few manifestations of communal tribute to the Supreme Being first came to my -notice. It was in a season and in an area in which the people, for sleeping-sickness precautions, had not only had to be moved from their natural and spacious habitats in shade and near water to comparatively sterile ground and into villages along open roads, but had also suffered a simultaneous shortage of rain, and had then been moved again in the same season and lost their seed-time by the road-making and forest-clearing entailed. The humble offering by the people to Mboli of the fruits of his earth was, one gathered, conceived in this case to bring about a softening of the hearts of alien kings, princes, and governors who had altered the allocation of the land, and to ask Mboli, lord of the soil, to sustain them through the coming scarcity, and to activate through his powers of nature the goodwill of the new ground they were to cultivate. The bearers of the offering of firstfruits had, in this instance, been called forth by the chief amid the approbation of the people in increasing procession from house to house. Thence they moved with simple cadenced song towards the open table rock which gives birth to the source of a river and looks out over the whole country- side. The songs appeared to consist of chorused invocations of a very limited variety. Considerable alarm and despondency were created during our stay at the neighbouring village by a bursting storm which, occurring during the night, washed off a large proportion of the offerings into the stream below. Passing next morning about dawn on my way to shoot, I was an attentive witness and hearer of the impromptu meeting held on the spot by the earliest passers-by. The communal offering is not necessarily a seasonal' or regular affair. It is organized as occasion or events may demand. It is usually made on the initiative of the chief diviner of the senior Vongara chief, but there would appear to be no offices held in connection with it. The offering is in the nature of an insurance against defective productivity, and also, perhaps, is a tangible recognition of the power of Mboli to concede or to withhold the full usufruct of the earth. 1 The ceremony is not habitually held more than once in a Zande year, that is, a season. It most usually, but not necessarily, takes place in the month of Bandulo, which corresponds roughly to our month of December, and is compounded of the two words Ba-ndulo = father (of) mist.</page><page sequence="8">178 J. E. T. PIaLIpps.-Observations on some Aspects oJ The ceremony is commonly known in the northern area as that of Belmti, which is contracted from the words Ba-eleti signifying father-(of)-cultivated-fields. This may not unreasonably be taken as an attribute of Mboli, one of whose principal functions consists in acting as the spiritual land-lord of the A-zande (sande, sende) or people-of-the-soil! The Azande are essentially an agricultural people. They possess no cattle, sheep, or goats of any kind, nor do they appear to recollect ever having owned any. Dogs and poultry are their sole live stock. There remains little doubt in my mind that this dignified and simple ceremony is carried out exclusively in honour of Mboli, the national divinity, the Supreme Being of the Zande race. 2. SOULS (amb?isimo). 3. GHOSTS (at6lo). The Zande recognizes the existence of a soul, mbisimo, as part of the composition of every human being. Further, the conception would not appear to be limited to man, but applies also to certain animals, notably those of chief importance in the eyes of the people. The notion, however, is distinct from that involved in the word kilimo, the human (or other) shadow, which appears to have little or no psychological significance. The seat of the soul is within the human body, but opinion is apt to differ as to its precise location. The similarity of the word vuse (stomach) in its compounded declensions, e.g. vuru(-ko: his) stomach, and the adverb of place (probably of the same root) vuru, signifying, in a general sense, inside, may just possibly have caused some slight confusion in the minds of some enquirers who have felt no doubts as to the definite location of the Zande soul in the gastric region of the body. Thus (mb?isimo) kina ku vuru-ko yo: " is in his stomach "; but (mbisimo) vuru boro du: 5 is within a man." The use of the uncompounded nominative: (mbisimo) du vuse-yo: " is in a stomach," would make clearer a detail upon which I feel some hesitation, though the latter and more definite view is certainly held by some of the alien peoples over whom Zande influence extends. Survival of the human spirit after death. In order to endeavour to avoid even unwitting misrepresentation or the reading of any interpretation influenced by alien or preconceived ideas as to the survival of the soul after death I think it safer and more practical to reproduce here, to enable it to be weighed up and checked by readers, a precis of numerous statements made in the course of casual conversations with French and Sudan Azande taken down in each case within an hour of their utterance. I should not care to commit myself to an opinion as to how far these conceptions are as yet shared by self-styled or bilingual Azande (e.g. APambiya, BaHima, BaGuru or AMbomu, etc.), who form almost a majority of the Zande confederation in French and Sudan territories.</page><page sequence="9">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 179 The translation is as literal as I have been able to make it, and the nuances of the tenses have been given their full value. One witness was heard to say to his young son: Ka boro kpi, mbitsimo-ni ki ninane n'ani-" When a man has-just-died (that which was), his spirit is wont- to-remain with us (i.e. in the vicinity)." Akaya-ni ki nandu ku zegi-yo-" His corpse fares forth without (i.e. to the grave)." Another Zande remarked: Ku-sayo, akaya nasa tihe rogo gumba-" Later, the body transforms itself into (the space of) a lightning-beast." Singiya rogo gani na dunduko-" Or (transforms itself) into (the space of) his beast all (or any)."' Tolo-ni ninane be Mboli-" His disembodied-spirit is-wont-to-stay (in the) hand (of) Mboli." Si nakaraga tihe ko-no du ani ni-" It turns itself back to-here where we are." Ki namanga rani nga agumeni, ni rengo-" And works (on) us who are its kinsfolk, in truth." Another witness's statement was: Ni-ba-sa-sa si nagu ko-no du ani ni-"At times it flits to here where we are." Pai sa, si ninala-ala be Mboli dedede- "But (lit. one thing) it just-dwells-habitually (in the) hand (of) Mboli always." The statements, being a medley of the most persistently recurring phrases of differing types and sexes, are for us, perhaps, neither very coherent nor very precise, but they are at least a faithful reflection of the natural working of the Zande mind on a question about which it is intimately though, as it were, shyly concerned. The delicacy and patience necessarily expended in eliciting intimate statements in the form of casual or spontaneous expression, and without cross-questioning, seemvs to me amply rewarded by the higher degree of credibility which may probably be attached to the results. It should incidentally be added that none of the people whose conversations on this subject I recorded had, as far as I could in each case ascertain, any acquaintance with Sangha, Arabic or Bangalla (the respective commercial languages of the three territories), any knowledge of which usually points to the individual having to some extent come under outside influence. In his belief that the ghost is with, or " in the hand of," Mboli, I have not found any definite indication of any physical limitation by the assignment of any " place to him. When travelling with Azande outside their own country, I have more than once remarked them to attribute misfortunes experienced abroad to the direct inter- vention of the offended spirits of kinsfolk buried at home as much as a month's trek from our line of march. 1 That is, it transforms itself into, for instance, the lightning totem or into whatever else his totem-animal may be. The lightning (gumba) and the rainbow (wango) are usually referred to in the animal gender so as to imply that they are animals; in which guise they are actually common totems of the Azande. VOL. LVI. N</page><page sequence="10">180 J. E. T. PHILIPPS.-Observations on some Aspects oJ In one instance the sufferer went so far as audibly to specify his views of, the causative factor. His wife, he surmised, had committed adultery, and his father's at6lo were probably evincing simultaneous displeasure on all three of the triangle, and giving a warning so that the wife should make propitiatory offerings and that he should return home to supervise both which at that time he had no desire to do. But this is only a single instance and not necessarily typical. This would seem to point to a wide sphere of influence of the at6lo, namely, one that is not confined to the vicinity of the grave, the home, or the tribal area, though I should be inclined to suspect the latter to be commonly regarded as the normal limits of activity of the spirits of the nation. It may not perhaps be quite irrelevant to the wider aspect of the question to record in this connection the similar views of a native of Tanganyika (with whose processes of thought I was very familiar) while in Europe (Spain) with me some years ago. He spoke no European language and had maintained a quite remarkable reverence for his totemism and his tribal cult., While thus removed entirely from the sights and sounds of African life, there befell him a small but unexpected mis- fortune of a kind which is normally, among his people, attributable solely to the malevolence of disembodied spirits. He repeatedly expressed great astonishment that this kind of thing could occur in Europe, where the white gods hold sway outside the black zone in which at the utmost they could be expected effectually to operate. The supposed persecutor in his case has usually been his deceased father's brother who had survived, held the heritage with injustice, and recently died. In the case of the totem-beast into which the physical strength and energy of the dead man is held to pass,' no emotion of either fear or surprise is felt at an appear- ance of the animal concerned in the vicinity of the burying-place. Occasional uneasiness is evinced by unusually frequent visitations at periods of crisis such as birth or illness in the family. The greater nocuous beasts, such as the lion and the leopard, constitute the totems of the aristocratic clans Bokunde (Bakinda), Kulangba, and Vongara. These animals are in outlying parts of the confederation differently regarded by these clans as regards the details of totemic practice. 4. GHOSTS, OF ANCESTORS (At6lo-aba). Practice of the cult. The phrase at6lo-aba, ghosts (of) fathers, is plural. I have not myself heard it used in a singular form. I am not, however, prepared to assert that it is never so used. At6lo-aba is almost more than a mere plural. Its use seems rather 1 I am under the strong impression that the Zande does not believe that the dead man is simply and entirely transformed into a (clan) beast, or that his soul enters into a beast, but ratlher that Jhis store of energy or vital spark goes back into the common fund of vital energy which enables man and beast (of the clan) to persist and thrive.</page><page sequence="11">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 181 intentionally collective as if referring to ancestral-ghosts en masse, or to ancestral- spiritdom either of the clan or, in a larger sense, of the Vongara chieftainship which is the unit of Zande population. Even when reference is clearly to the ghost of a father or mother very recently deceased, and to whom attentions may be overdue, it is the plural form which is habitually employed. Apart from the impression which one thus receives, the atmosphere of the Zande world seems impregnated with a tacit acceptance of the conviction that each individual is living in a world of spirit-ambience composed of the collectivity of ancestral ghosts who demand respectful attentions in proportion to the recentness of their entrance into the spirit- matter. It is very seldom that the ghost of an individual of more than a generation older than the living head of the house is felt to retain sufficient individuality to merit specific mention or separate physical attentions. The expectation and demand for attention would thus seem to subside proportionately as individuality fades, becoming less imperious as the progressive process of immergence in the spirit-matter proceeds. The stronger the character or the influence of the deceased in life, the more refractory the ghost may be to the merging of its personality in the spirit- ambience of the clan which enwraps, guides, and guards the interests and destinies of the Zande family. Rago, says the Zande, sala haleme kiya-" There is some- thing extra-ordinary in the air to-day." (Rago is " atmosphere," ambience, " air.") On this last point I do not feel competent to put forward more than a very tentative suggestion to indicate a possible line of investigation. The people them- selves are seldom conscious of the significance or origin of their own ideas on such an elusive article of belief. The above are merely spontaneous impressions derived from direct observations in the field. Manifestations of the active physical observances performed by the living Zande towards his ancestral ghosts are chiefly observable during the preparations for war or hunting, at the establishment of a new home, at the construction of the new buildings, at the first meal on the new home-site, at the establishment of the first cultivations, and at the harvesting of the results. In short, at any new phase of activity of his life, the Zande wishes to avert the chance of disapproval, to tran- quillize, and to have the approbation and goodwill of, those of his nearer ancesiry in the spirit-world who may still be in a position to exert an influence. Living isolated as he appears to have done since his appearance in these wooded savannah- lands, he has, however, not developed the spirit of the Bantu village-groups, whose lives and actions have been first and foremost subservient to the good of the com- munity as a whole. (I might perhaps interpolate the remark that I do not consider the African of Zande blood in any way inferior in natural intelligence to the vaunted Ganda stock.) At the establishment of a new home, the simple Zande erects, usually near the central entrance to the circle of his huts, an " altar " for offerings to the at6lo. It is usually constructed from the wood of the tree sasa, of which a stout pole is planted in the ground. The upper part of the pole is either selected for its N 2</page><page sequence="12">182 J. E. T. PHILIPPS.-Observations on some Aspects of natural multiple embranchment, or is split up so as to form artificially a kind of round and capacious basket. Ashes from the newly established hearth are tubbed upon the lower end of the pole before it is planted in the ground. The height of the basket receptacle from the ground is normally about five feet. The altar is known as tuka, or, more fully, tuka-at6lo. In the houses of the Vongara aristocracy one often sees the basket with a cover of the same wood placed over it or, in the gbwanga or court (called " of justice ") of an influential territorial chief, a " doll's-house" shrine, about three feet broad and high. The one pole in such cases is sometimes increased to four, in accordance with the size of the erection which it has to support. The height of the receptacle from the ground remains usually about the same. As the harvest of maize, potatoes, millet, etc., ripens in their respective seasons, the owner of the house and crops will usually place some of the first crop gathered upon the tuka as an ofiering to the at6lo, before the family has partaken of any part of the crop for their own food. Certain signs and passes, which give one the impression of being somewhat vague and varying, are made close by the altar before the offering is actually placed in position. I have witnessed this ceremony on several occasions and no uneasiness has seemed to be caused by my presence. The bearer of the offering has, in cases I have witnessed, been a man. He has held. in his hand a bunch of the leaves bambili. The preliminary movements of his arms are in an up and down direction, and remind one perhaps most of the action of a man sieving; from which pe-rhaps the phrase to describe it may be derived. For when on the first occasion in the Bas-Uele, in the dim mists which immediately succeed the dawn, I came upon a Zande going through these evolutions before a domestic altar, and asked him at the conclusion what they might portend, the answer I received was: Mi napeka at6lo-- "I am winnowing the at6lo (or, perhaps, for the at6lo)." It may be that these motions are used as typical of the acts preliminary in Zande-land to the preparation of the staple food of man; for the word, as I came later to learn, is that usually employed in the term peka mnoru, " winnow grain."' The phrase commonly used to describe the propitiation of the at6lo in general is voha (or vuga) at6lo. Chiefs, perhaps as more responsible for the community in the eyes of the people and of the at6lo, are accustomed to cause their offerings to be made daily about dawn. Nor will a succulent morsel from the " chief's-right " portion of the meat of the chase-the liver or the kidney-be withheld by a pious Vongara. Incidently, it may be noted that a Vongara is always apt to be more taciturn or deliberately misleading on the question of religious observances than the simple Zande. The Avongara have lost much and gained little by European occupa- tion. If the at6lo are neglected or deprived of the attentions which are their due, 1 Moru or molu, a species of small millet, know-n in Arabic as telebun.</page><page sequence="13">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 183 the stroke of ill-fortune or the bolts of disease must be expected by the impious. Sores on the feet or in the lips or mouth are among outward and visible signs of the displeasure of at6lo. Invisible signs are most often revealed in dreams. In cases of illness attributable, or attributed by diviners, to the at6lo, it is a near male relative who at early dawn and in the presence of the patient will make the introductory supplication before the altar. The patient will then cause to be prepared a fowl of white plumage. This he will eat seated close by the altar, most often with its shade cast athwart his shoulders. Others are not encouraged to be near, and a propitious silence is the order of the day. Chattering among the attendant women or children of the household is sternly repressed, usually by the same master of ceremonies or officiant who has already made the preliminary supplication. Spectators are not encouraged to approach within the immediate zone of operations, in order that the full flow of the influence and virtue which unbinds and releases the malady from the patient may be concentrated upon him and not to be diverted or diluted, as might occur if other and distracting persons were near by. No inconvenience or uneasiness, however, has seemed to be felt when I have asked leave to be present with the anxious relatives in the far background. On such occasions one naturally endeavours to repay the courtesy and confidence of the natives by conducting oneself unobtrusively and as respectfully as a true believer. The fowl is first offered, perhaps it might be said sacrificed, before the altar by a similar winnowing motion, and with a brief set-invocation for the " lifting " of the disease. In cases I have been privileged to witness the officiant has been a man. I do not, however, think that this is by any means invariable. In instances where the at6lo are believed to be of the female side of the family, say, those of a mother and grandmother, causing sterility to a daughter of whose marriage or husband they, as is common, may have disapproved, the mediator is, I understand, sometimes a near female relative. The fowl is in any case usually plucked and prepared by a woman. 5. SPIRITS, MALIGNANT (Agilissa (agirisa)). There is no cult, dignity, reverence or ceremony accorded by the Azande to the dreaded agtlisa. Yet they are, it is true, described by some as: Gbibita at6lo nga agirisa-" Evil at6lo are the agilisa." There appears, then, to exist a certain recognized affinity between the ag'tlisa and the at6lo or ghosts of men and of the higher animals, but: Pai sa, bangirani ni gu he kiya-" Nevertheless, in our eyes, it is a different thing (in action)." Legbo agirisa kiya-" The character of the agilisa is not the same." There are certain peculiar Zande phrases (for the language consists very largely of set-pieces of diction) whose occurrence and repetition in connection with the agilisa never fails to make one start, and jog one's memory into recollections</page><page sequence="14">184 J.

Agirisa naziya boro aziya ti mvwo ki ninamanga ko na gbibita pai-" The ag?ilisa just seize a man with violence in the wilderness and are-wont-to-do him harm (or, to maltreat him)." Again: Ni ba sa sa agirisa nata boro3 ata ti mvwo-" Sometimes the agtlisa beat a man in the bush." Again: Gu boro le nahinga gine ki nala ko yo gbwe, nayala hebe-" The man is lost, and remains out there many (days) wandering dazed." Again: K'ani agumeko nandu fwe ko khu mvwo yo hi bi ko, ho ninandu ki li wa n-a -" When we, his relatives, go forth to search for him in the bush and find him, he behaves and eats like a beast of the field." Here, then, we have a limited description of the agitlisa4 which is not explicit in detail and is far from coherent. For the Zande mind does not find it necessary to push his conception of the spirits to the length of physical or comprehensive definition which our more material and logical occidental minds demand. What data then have we at our disposal in the actual limited statements from the mouth of the Zande himself ? The agirisa are by some identified with evil at6lo. We may then at least assume them on this view to be ghosts of human beings, but not necessarily of any particular epoch, parentage, or class. While of the same general origin, they are clearly marked off by a fundamental difference of temperament and intention. They are definitely malignant in manifesbation. They do not give .evidence of individuality in their activities, but appear to act collectively. No defined set of characteristics nor any human actions of a specific nature are known to draw upon man the sudden bewildering acts of violence to which, in Zande belief, the healthiest may become victims when alone in certain localities in the bush. Both an access of physical violence is experienced by the victims and also the complete 1 Melesa.-Mela, the intransitive form of the verb, is, for instance, very frequently used of wives who consider themselves ill-treated and run away from home in fear. 2 Ti mvwo, "1 in the jungle," as opposed to ku mvwo yo, "' into the jungle." a The Zande always seem to use the singular form boro, man, rather than aboro, men. In effect, no instance of alleged possession by spirits of more than one single individual at a time has come to my notice. 4 Azande, when referring to agilisa in the third person plural (they), will most often use the pronoun ami, which is almost exclusively used of the animal creation as opposed to the two other genders which have reference to neuter things or to man. I have known of cases where epileptics have, by occasional similarity of behaviour, come to be loosely referred to as airagilisa (a-ira-agilisa), " possessors of agilisa," or, in our inverted parlance, possessed by spirits of evil. They are not treated with any particular deference, and are thus presumably not considered capable of spiritual harm. In their periods of calm succeeding any stormy bout of supposed relations with agilisa, they are in some parts held to be prophets of (evil) things concealed from the normal man, not necessarily of the future.</page><page sequence="15">Religion among the Azande (" Niam-niam "), Equatorial Africa. 185 and sometimes permanent overthrow of the mental equilibrium, by which the rman appears to be flung back reeling into the beast. There is, of course, a bare possibility in such cases that the physical injuries may be self-inflicted under the influence of mental derangement. But the physical position of - such injuries in many cases does not tend to bear this out as a general theory. Certain definite physical features of the countryside are clearly associated in the mind of the Zande with the presence of ctgilisa. A Zande will, for instance, avoid, especially if unaccompanied, passing over very many of the great smooth rock outcrops known as munga, often a mile square in extent, which are such a peculiar feature of his country, even if such avoidance entails a long and wearisome detour. The Zande looks particularly askance at those Amungal from whose resounding depths a river springs. In this connection we may compare the open- air place of offering to the National Protector, the Supreme Being, Mboli (p. 173 above). Here attention may perhaps profitably be drawn to the existence of a Zande verb munga, which signifies a state of being stupefied or dazed. A further point to be iioted is the fact that it is not unusual for cases to be believed to occur of a man being subjected to any violent action on the part of the agtlisa in his own home. The phrase commonly employed and already recorded above is definite in specifying that a man first comes under the violent influence of the agttisa in the wilderness (ti mvwo). Here he is then driven headlong until thoroughly exhausted, when he wanders dazed and aimless until death supervenes, or he is found. I have never heard it suggested that the ag'tlisa are seen in human form, nor that the marks of violence on the body of a victim gave any impression of having been inflicted by wild animals. The instances which have directly or indirectly come to my notice appeared to have occurred in broad daylight. The ag'tlisa in the eyes of the Zande would seem to be remarkable by an apparently insensate odium humani generts. An interesting statement of opinion was made to me by one Ngbwa-zegi-no, a French subject, to the effect that he surmised them to be the disincarnated spirits of the murdered and the wronged. Incidentally, to interpolate a parallel, the Banya Ruanda of Belgian East Africa believe in and foresee such an eventuality. I have attended on two occasions in (the) Ruanda2 the (cave-) burial of murdered BaTutsi, as a token of respect and grati- tude for help and kindnesses received from them. Burial was, as frequently, by night. As the body was lowered by torchlight through the mouth of the cave on to the lava- ledge below, the eldest male relative placed a sheepskin round the body with the spoken formula: "When thy spirit return, may it come unto us mild as a lamb of thy flock." Amunga is the plural form of munga. 2 The word ruanda signifies " kingdom."</page><page sequence="16">186 J. E. T. PEILIPPS.-Observations on some Aspects of Ngbwa-zegi-no is old, courteous, and unsophisticated. After many days, over an evening pipe, he confided to me an experience which had befallen his father by the agency of agtlisa. On the completion of his narrative I commented on the experience as " rare and extraordinary." He assured me that it was not. His father had walked out early one morning on to a munga, within half an hour of their home and overlooking the Ubangi River, to try to descry the position of a h-unting-party operating in the neighbourhood. His father was at that time in perfect mental and physical health, nor had he any experiences in the past in which the influence of the ag"lisa could be suspected. At the time of the evening meal he had not returned. As the hunting-party was still absent he was presumed to have joined it and no alarm was felt at home. At dawn of the next day, however, he had not returned, whereas the hunters had come back in the early part of the night and had not seen anything of the missing man. On the following morning one of his wives, who had gone out to collect firewood, came upon her husband's spear lying in a small rocky depression on the further side of the munga, about a quarter of a mile from the base of the outcrop. The position of the spear, with one side partially blunted, showed it to have been suddenly thrown carelessly or dropped; footsteps showed signs of a hurried departure. No signs of other track were visible. The woman ran back to the home. A hue and cry was raised. A hasty offering was made to the at6lo. A search party of relatives hurried off to the scene of the discovery. It was not until the following day, about sunset, that they came up with the missing man. He appeared to be wandering aimlessly away from the direction of his home. He was obviously exhausted and hobbling painfully. He was badly battered and bruised about the eyes, the feet and the small of the back. He was quite unable to give an account of his condition. He appeared terrified of the members of his own family, of whom he showed no signs of recognition. When approached he endeavoured to escape. When unable to do so through weakness he fell on the ground and began to chew the grass. He was wrapped in a rough sleeping-mat and carried home. Despite every effort to calm his inexplicable fears he never properly recovered his faculties, and died a broken man before two moons had waned. No further facts transpired. No mystery was suspected. It was just the agtlisa. In 1921, at Utiandumbu, in the Congo forest, where the people of the region are Bantu-speakers, I had the fortune. by chance, to witness what appeared to be a similar case of a man who had just been found wandering far from any habitation in a dazed condition, and was being brought in by his relatives from the forest, where he was alleged to have been seized and possessed by spirits. Unfortunately I did not speak the tribal language, though I had acquired just that dangerous sufficiency which so often gives rise to misunderstandings. There was, however, no difficulty in conimunicating with the people in the commercial lingua franca of the Congo, which I did not fail to do. The subject was a young man who was stated by his relatives never to have been previously anything but healthy.

His mouth was flecked with foam. The swollen eyes goggled half open with a kind of terror-stricken stare. He appeared to be in a state of trembling terror, which oddly enough did not manifest itself so much when I approached him as it did towards his own relatives, who seemed to be doing everything in their power to calm and nurse him. When approached by them he threw himself on all fours with his face on the ground. He gnawed at the leaves and made motions with his already bleeding hands as if wishing to burrow underground, perhaps to hide himself. The fleeting impression on my mind was of seeing a creature possessed by a demon, of a human being recently invaded by the nature and instincts of a beast of the field. I recollect that at the time there passed through my mind the experience of one Nebuchadnezzar, who " was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers and his nails like bird's claws." The only rational suggestion that I could make to myself was that, following on some aggression or imprudence of his own, the man had been set upon by some of the larger anthropoid apes, which we had ourselves frequently heard and occasionally seen in the forest. But the people would have none of it. They were apparently in no doubt as to the causes: 1 Ndoki abluki ye kuna na jamba-" An evil spirit did him harm there in the jungle." Ndoki asir' apiki ye, na kubuka. tanyo naye nyoso-" An evil spirit has assaulted him and broken his mind entirely." [7th January, 1926.] 1 The language is Bangalla (LiNgala).</page></plain_text>
