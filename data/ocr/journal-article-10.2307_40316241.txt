<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIDDEN DISSENSION: MINORITY-MAJORITY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE USE OF CONTESTED TERMINOLOGY PHYLLIS MORROW AND CHASE HENSEL Abstract "The ability to dominate derives in part from imposing one's construction of reality as the natural order of things," says Jean Philibert (1990:266). Using examples from debates over essentially negotiable concepts ("subsistence," "conservation," "customary and traditional use") this article examines policy negotiations between Alaska Natives and non-Native governmental representatives. It is suggested that negotiating parties often assume contested terms represent congruent realities, and that this assumption may mask deeper cultural disagreements. Too, while the dominating Euroamerican construction of reality is presented as a culture-free scientific paradigm, "scientific" policies may be un- consciously influenced by Western folklore and beliefs. Nonetheless, Alaska Natives are pressured to defend their practices in a manner consonant with approved patterns of West- ern discourse and logic. As this narrows the field of convincing arguments available for discourse, it sets precedents which redefine Native cultures into Western categories, and tends to further narrow and codify customary practices. Introduction After many years of exclusion from the external decision-making processes affecting their social institutions and resources, Alaska Natives are now urged to voice their opinions by participat- ing directly and through representatives in in- numerable committees, surveys, and public meetings. While bilinguals often serve as in- terpreters in these exchanges, English supplies the conceptual categories - the idiom and the jar- gon - which are at the crux of the decision-making process, and final reports are filed in that lan- guage. For the most part, the intention of these forums is to find points of agreement between Native and non-Native viewpoints, in order to plan actions which will in some way reflect Native agreement. Ideological differences between the systems rarely surface in such discussions, because the focus is on planning actions rather than under- standing the varied justifications behind them, and because the politically powerful participants in the dialogue - the legislators, resource managers, and enforcement agencies - supply the vocabulary in which the debate will be framed. This is charac- teristic of postcolonial power relations, where "the ability to dominate derives in part from imposing one's construction of reality as the natural order of things" (Philibert 1990:266). Philibert 's article, set in Vanuatu, focuses on the governmental redefini- tion of language and symbols, the reification and Phyllis Morrow, Department of Anthropology, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 Chase HenseJ, Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley (344 Ester Drive, Fairbanks, AK 99709] ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 38-53, 1992</page><page sequence="2">Morrow and Hensel: Hidden Dissension 39 redefinition of culture history, to prevent political opposition (Philibert 1990:251). In the Melanesian case, an urban elite is creating a new national iden- tity based on a cultural pride that harkens to a par- tially fictionalized precolonial past, but in other parts of the world the degree to which such sym- bols are intentionally manipulated varies (cf . Hobs- bawm and Ranger 1983). 2 In the Alaskan cases considered here, govern- ment agency representatives and Central Alaskan Yup'ik Eskimos3 each pursue their political inter- ests actively, but both parties accept a common idiom in an apparently mutual effort to communi- cate, expressing little or no awareness that the terms of their discussion are often conflicting. The use of an unexamined common vocabulary to create a false sense of agreement among the parties is par- tially based on the assumption that translated or cross-cultural meanings are congruent rather than merely overlapping. Because of the emphasis on overlap, all parties are sometimes pleased with the results of negotia- tion and no problems surface later. At other times, misunderstandings follow once the agreement is in effect, and each party privately speculates that the other is guilty of insincerity, betrayal, or simple dis- regard. This paper explores some reasons why, at the conclusion of such negotiations, people may think that they understand each other, when in fact they do not. It will be suggested that these hidden dissensions have serious consequences in terms of ethnic identification and the establishment of polit- ical and legal precedents. Subsistence, Language and Identity: Defining Self and Others Examples of this dialogue are drawn from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Region of Southwest Alaska, where approximately 15,000 Yupiit live in some 50 villages, most situated along the two major rivers or near the Bering Sea coast. Subsistence fishing, hunting, and gathering are very important to local diet and identity. Since the examples that follow concern these areas, it will be helpful to sup- ply some background. Subsistence harvests in the Delta are among the highest in the state, in some villages reaching an annual per capita of up to 1100 pounds (Wolfe and Walker 1987; Pete 1989). While the seasonal round varies substantially from village to village, depending on the local ecology, the generic word for food and for fish is the same. Seals, walrus, and beluga whales are also hunted avidly, and sea mammal products are widely shared and traded. Large and small land animals are hunted; berries and both edible and medicinal herbs are gathered. Preserved food stocks see the population through the winter, but by spring they begin to run low, and people hunger for the plen- tiful waterfowl which come to nest in the watery Delta. There is a complex interplay between subsis- tence and commercial activities on both individual and regulatory levels (see Wolfe 1984). Subsistence salmon harvests take legal precedence over com- mercial ones; commercial periods are timed and harvest levels are set to minimize impact on subsis- tence activities (Albrecht 1990). Since an indi- vidual's commercial harvesting activities constitute a behavioral extension of local subsistence prac- tices, involving essentially the same technology and personnel, the two spheres are, in many ways, colloquially treated as one. Harvesting is the focus of much of the daily talk and activity of the region. Much of that daily talk is in Yup'ik: bilingual- ism is the norm, with the indigenous language widely spoken as a first and often preferred lan- guage. The oldest people are generally mono- lingual in Yup'ik, or have very little English fluency. Non-Native English-speaking mono- linguals, however, comprise the vast majority of administrators and bureaucrats. It is only among all-Native groups (such as village councils) that Yup'ik may be used exclusively in a governmental setting. Bilingualism is one manifestation of the area's character. The region is typically described as the intersection of "two worlds": the worlds of Yupiit and Kass'at (non- Yupiit originating in the "Lower 48" states). The "two world" model sounds rela- tively fixed, deriving as it does from an originally profound historical and geographical separation. For Yup'ik people, in particular, there is a sense that a body of tradition, a language, and a genetic heritage set them apart from others. Non-Yup'iks tend to claim more diversity in their own heritages, and offer a wide range of responses to questions about their ethnic backgrounds. Still, they gener- ally define themselves as distinct from Yup'ik peo- ple - or at least, they define Yup'ik people as dis- tinct from themselves. In fact, however, the representation of these cultural divisions changes in the course of dialogue between members of the two groups. As Yup'ik people increasingly participate in interethnic dialogue, boundaries become simultaneously harder to define and increasingly important. This is because it is in the course of boundary disputes that the distinctions between the "two worlds" are re- peatedly questioned. Such divisive questions as who can be enrolled as a Native for the purpose of claiming land, who can hunt and fish for certain resources, and who is eligible for Indian health ser- vices, bilingual education, and other programs, have necessitated repeated redefinition of what it means to be Yup'ik. Each prerogative requires one to demonstrate eligibility as a Native, but the defi-</page><page sequence="3">40 Arctic Anthropology 29:1 nitions and eligibility criteria vary. Thus, for one program one must prove genetic relationship; for another, one must demonstrate a history of previous land use or occupancy; and for yet another, one must be able to speak the Yup'ik language. The regulatory process, then, tends to shift the question of identity from self-definition ("Who am I?") to institutional definition ("What can you qualify for?"). The move is a reflexive one, how- ever, because people begin to wonder who they are if they are not described by the various semantic properties that non-Natives assign to their eth- nicity. Watching a film of reconstructed Netsiling- miut life in Canada, one group of Yup'ik school- children, for example, insisted that those are the "real Eskimos," a particular irony since their own self-designation means "the real people." Custom, Tradition, and Regulation When the discourse of personal and group identity moves into the legal arena, it is the notion of cul- ture itself which goes on trial. Here, it is necessary to discuss some distinctions between customary and legal decision-making. Outside of the legal arena, conflicts are negotiated through culturally strategic manipulation of precedents. For example, the issue of how to treat someone who has broken into a village school and stolen money depends on the offender's past history, current family situation, apparent willingness to atone and/or make repara- tion, and his economic need. Often the incident is resolved locally, without recourse to Western au- thorities. If, however, the Alaska State Troopers enter the scene and the case is legally prosecuted, the discourse changes considerably.4 Similar to the way Native identity is treated, such a case is re- solved in the courts with reference to definitions: either the offender is a thief, or he is not; and the degree of his theft is similarly well-defined. Past history cannot enter the discussion, and punish- ment can only take personal factors into account within clear limits. Custom emphasizes how a case should be treated; law rests on how an act is de- fined, the treatment following necessarily from the definitional status.5 While (perhaps because) Western law is rela- tively rigid and compliance with it compulsory, it is also subject to more dramatic reversals. To the Yup'ik eye, this makes the legal situation dan- gerously unpredictable. A case in point is the his- toric shift from forbidding the use of Native lan- guages on all federal property (including, at that time, schools) between 1910 and 1960, to the estab- lishment of bilingual education programs in a na- tional climate of civil rights during the 1970s (Krauss 1980:24). Some parents, having been punished for speaking Yup'ik in school, were loathe for many years to have their children partici- pate in bilingual programs. They stated that there was nothing to keep the government from changing its mind again. In other cases, such as the regula- tion of customary adoptions, there has also been a history of rigid applications of policy, sometimes varying from one agency to another and sometimes suddenly reversed by factors completely external to the local situation and unknown to those affected by the changed rulings (Morrow and Pete 1991). Thus, to Yupiit, Kass'aq legalities often ap- pear powerful, arbitrary, rigid, and insecure, while to non-Natives, Yup'ik practices may appear weak, unregulated, poorly rationalized, and insufficient.6 Moreover, Yupiit are pressured, sometimes very subtly, to defend their practices in a manner conso- nant with patterns of Western discourse and logic. As this narrows the field of convincing arguments available for discourse, it sets precedents which redefine Yup'ik culture into Western categories, and tends to further narrow and codify customary practices, a point to which we will return later. Negotiations over subsistence and land pro- vide clear examples of this process. Like other small societies, Yup'ik society is continuously threatened by economic development and exploita- tion. Attacked on an economic level, Yupiit react by defending their livelihood, which has become syn- onymous with defending their culture. In recent years, subsistence and land rights have been the main line of defense against cultural extinction. This discourse centers on the interpretation of a jargonistic expression: "customary and tradi- tional." When Natives can successfully argue that current practices including locations of harvests and, in some cases, means of harvest are "cus- tomary and traditional," then their legal rights to continue these practices in a similar manner are confirmed, and at the same time cemented, since variation in practices, beyond those specifically certified as "customary and traditional" is not pos- sible.7 In a recent legal case, conflicts over the in- terpretation of this expression became apparent. Two boys were charged with shooting a muskox out of season. The muskox, an animal not typically found near this village, had wandered into the area. Since this was an anomalous case, the boys were concerned about taking appropriate action, and asked village elders, the arbiters of custom, whether or not they should shoot it. They were encouraged to do so: according to Yup'ik ideology, animals which come to the hunter are to be taken. If animals offer themselves and are refused, they may be offended and refuse to return in future to the hunter. The boys killed the muskox, and the meat was distributed to the village following cultural patterns. In court, however, the prosecuting attor- ney argued that muskoxen were not a traditional source of game, and the boys had not shot because</page><page sequence="4">Morrow and Hensel: Hidden Dissension 41 they had a dire need for food, another possible exception to the law. Therefore, a cultural argu- ment did not hold, and the boys were found guilty and fined.8 From the Yup'ik perspective, an individually anomalous case was strategically interpreted in line with traditional practice, and the irregularity was made regular. From the Western legal perspective, because the animal was anomalous, the actions could not be considered traditional. The Yupiit emphasized the way a specific cultural practice was interpreted to encompass an unpredictable event. The Western judge invoked a narrowly defined rule, which could not be stretched to incorporate the new situation. While "custom and tradition" would seem to be the province of those who are reckoned "traditional peoples," it was the defini- tion as interpreted by nonindigenous people that determined the verdict. The insistence that Natives conform to tradi- tion as defined by non-Natives is a logical conse- quence of Western conceptions of non- Western law. Sally Falk Moore, commenting on missionary and anthropological accounts of customary law, notes that: . . . there is an underlying assumption . . . that such law is ancient custom, that law is traditional, that law is fixed, at least when it comes to "native" law. There is an implicit assumption that, of course, "modern societies" have legislatures and courts through which innovations may be promul- gated or implemented, but that somehow the "natives" are stuck in their traditional ways (Moore 1988:4-5). What complicates this picture is that when people defend their traditions, they tend to perpetuate an asynchronic view of themselves, claiming that "we have always done it this way." As Moore (1988:5) notes, for the Chagga of Kilimanjaro "law changed steadily [over the past century] while being con- stantly and vigorously identified as the epitome of tradition." Ironically, tradition in the Alaskan context is also least effectively defended by those who con- form most closely to the image of the "traditional Native." That is, the greater the barriers to commu- nication in the form of one's dominance in the Native language, communicative style, and im- plicit cultural assumptions, the more one must rely on translators and spokespersons to make one's position known. An awareness of these disadvantages creates pressure towards acculturation in order to commu- nicate a traditional viewpoint. Obviously, the way to convince non-Natives of one's rights is to use non-Native forums and idioms. At the same time, the way to deprive Natives of their rights is to deny their Nativeness, focusing on those of their prac- tices that seem most assimilated. The more assimi- lated one's actions and appearance, however, the more the law questions one's traditional rights. Alaska Natives who speak fluent English (perhaps monolingually), wear clothing ordered from Sears, and hold satellite teleconferences do not appear worthy of separate treatment to the urban sports hunters and fishermen who compete for the same natural resources. Essentially, the argument is that "insofar as you are like us, you have to live by the same limits that we do; insofar as we are like you, we should have the same legal privileges that you do." Ironically, an argument based on equal treat- ment of individuals under the law thus becomes an impediment to the rights of indigenous groups. Furthermore, this dynamic is threatening to Native identity because the possibilities for ques- tioning one's own belonging in a group widen as members of another group question one's identity. For most members of the majority culture, ethnic identity is less important and/or more confused than it is for Alaska Natives. For example, it is not uncommon for an American of European ancestry to identify herself as "Scotch-Irish-English with a little Italian." Such people, for whom ethnicity is not a major concern of identity, easily misunder- stand the meaning of ethnicity for others. In effect, Kass'at assume that variability of practice equals variability of cultural traditions, while for Natives, variability of practice can be accommodated within a single heritage. Kass'at now sometimes refer to "real Yup'iks" (real real people), suggesting that some Yupiit are less than genuine. In short, mem- bers of the minority culture begin to adopt these majority judgements of authenticity at the same time that they enter into negotiations in the institu- tional arenas of the majority culture which most emphasize a sense of collective difference. "Bargaining for Reality" A concept useful in understanding the dynamics of negotiation is Lawrence Rosen's (1984) notion of "bargaining for reality." He uses this phrase to describe interactions between individual groups in a Muslim community, where an overtly competitive process characterizes the relationships he analyzes. While the Yup'ik situation is less openly agonistic, Rosen's concept, applied in a slightly different sense, is illustrative here. He describes a bargain- ing process where people may "possess, on one level, different orientations to concepts that they may be said, on another, to share" (1984: 187). What people share culturally then: however constrained or expansive the repertoire of relations open to them, are the concepts and pro- cedures by which relationships may themselves be negotiated. It is in this process, more than in the</page><page sequence="5">42 Arctic Anthropology 29:1 arrangement of its resultant forms, that we must seek the regularity and distinctiveness of ... culture (Rosen 1984: 188). Rosen suggests that the unequal power rela- tionship between the negotiating parties may be the factor which determines whose "reality" influ- ences the outcome of a negotiation. This is particu- larly true in minority-majority group negotiations where the concepts and procedures for negotiating relationships and reaching agreement are not likely to be shared. Nevertheless, it can be argued that negotia- tions sometimes take place as if these were shared. At the same time that members of different cultures may invoke differential views of social relation- ships, they employ terms of discussion which are assumed to reflect a shared universe of meaning, but actually represent noncongruent realities. We may call these "essentially negotiable concepts" (Rosen 1984: 185-6). Corresponding to the criteria described by Rosen, for each essentially negotiable concept there exists an ideal type whose authority all parties acknowledge. The very fact that each party enters competing claims to the proper use of these con- cepts is a reinforcement of their authority. For sig- nificant Alaskan concepts of "custom and tradi- tion," as well as "subsistence," and "conserva- tion," this authority is clear, although none are con- cepts that existed as isolated referents in the Yup'ik language before they became contested.9 For each contested concept, rival descriptions compete, and they are used both offensively and defensively in argument. Each also has an open quality, amenable to unpredictable modifications as it is used in dif- ferent situations. At the same time, they share little semantic ground, and the different realities they represent are rarely, if ever, acknowledged. An essentially negotiable concept is, then, "one whose proper use inevitably involves ongoing dispute and discussion on the part of its users, without which a working agreement constitutive of further action and interpretation is not possible" (Rosen 1984:188). Referencing, again, Philibert's observations, we would add that the amorphous character of these concepts helps to forestall oppo- sition to the actions they are used to justify. This is true even when such concepts are not intentionally used to silence opposition, as long as they are mutually reified. To use an example from the wider American political context, few would oppose "family values," a widely valorized, if negotiable, concept. Negotiations over subsistence issues again serve as a case in point. Subsistence rights are both attacked and rationalized on an economic basis, even though the Yup'ik assertion that subsistence is "a way of life," a complex of beliefs and practices, is repeatedly stated (see Sample B, Appendix). The attempt to find a common ground for negotiation ends with resort to a noble concept which both groups can espouse, that of "conservation." In fact, Native Americans are widely touted as the "origi- nal conservationists," a positive image that is adopted by Indians and environmentalists alike (cf. Redford 1991:46-48). Disguised are the different meanings - and practices - attached to this concept. A common Yup'ik concern, for instance, is that conservation requires particular actions which culturally signify a respectful stance towards game and fish. While both Yupiit and Kass'at fear impending ecological disaster, their causal explanations differ. For Yupiit, changing weather patterns, a decrease in the frequency of supernatural encounters, and reduced fish and game stocks are all considered to be effects of human failure to respect nature. Non- Yup'ik scientists, although they may debate the policy applications of the "conservation" concept, collectively assume that it is destruction of habitat and overhunting which endanger biological popu- lations. While Yupiit see animals as returning by will, biologists see them as self-renewable only through physiological processes. Both see habitat destruction as a problem, but the Yupiit abhor it as symptomatic of human disregard for animals, which prompts disregard from animals in turn. Furthermore, Yupiit talk about the problem in ways that subtly and implicitly differ from those characteristic of Kass'at discourse. Mike Chase's assertion (Sample B, Appendix) that "the fish aren't dumb, you know . . . just like us they live in that water and they see everything what's down there" might not have seemed culturally marked to the biologist he was addressing. It probably implies more than the listener heard, however, since this sentient description of the fish is consistent with Yup'ik epistemology. When Michael Chase sug- gests that the fish is "just like us," he refers to its human qualities, its yua, literally "its person." An even more subtle manifestation of these differing world views is that, during fish manage- ment meetings, Yupiit consistently speak of the absence of fish as a temporary consequence of some condition (such as wind direction, or water level), and assert that they will come soon, because people need them. In Joseph Lomack's words: "he won't disappear on that, he won't get put us to starvation on that. Maybe I'm not mistake on that" and the fish "are coming strongly for that, to help our peo- ple."10 The Kass'at, on the other hand, explicitly voice their concerns in terms of declining fish pop- ulations. Chairman John White summarizes this orientation: "We've been talking about there not being enough chum salmon, ever since the first period. Everybody that comes to this table, there's a point where they've got to make a decision that there's not enough fish, because one of the things that we have to decide here is when there's not</page><page sequence="6">Morrow and HenseJ: Hidden Dissension 43 enough fish." In fact, the Yup'ik participants have been most careful not to talk about there not being enough fish (see Appendix, Samples A and B). The idea that one's speech can "make things happen" is well-attested in Yup'ik society (Morrow 1990, 1984; Mather 1985). By speaking of the fish positively, Yupiit hope to assure their continuance and to prevent realization of the negative prognoses of non-Native managers. To the non-Natives how- ever, this seems like a predictable response from people who have a vested interest in catching fish. John White's frustration at what seems to be denial in the face of overwhelming evidence is apparent: "Everybody's had a reason to say that there's some there, but every time we put the fleet out there, we're hard pressed to harvest 50,000 fish." The subtle assumption of a Native basis for agreement with scientific conceptions is ironically evident even in discourse supportive of Native self- management or comanagement of resources. Osh- erenko (1988:40) sympathetically notes that "unfor- tunately, mutual respect for knowledge contributed by each party has been slow to develop in the (Yukon- Kuskokwim) Delta . . . Many elders, in particular, regard techniques such as capturing and tagging or writing on eggs as intrusive and believe that the researchers hamper the birds' reproductive suc- cess" (emphasis added). Because disturbance of birds during the nesting season is problematic for biologists, as well, it is easy for them to assume a similar basis for this complaint. In fact, however, it is not reproductive success per se which is the issue; rather, it is the response of sentient beings who, being affronted, make themselves unavailable to humans. Another example illustrating this ten- sion concerns catch-and-release fishing. At one meeting, Yup'ik participants tried to understand this concept, which was proposed as a way of satis- fying sports users without jeopardizing subsistence stocks. The idea, when it was eventually explained, was repulsive to the Yup'ik representatives because it involves throwing back fish that have willingly offered themselves (Mary C. Pete, Alaska Depart- ment of Fish and Game, personal communication, 1987; Wolfe 1989:26). A similar contradiction remained subliminal when there was local competition over muskoxen. The sports hunters, in a spirit of compromise, offered to give the villagers the meat, taking only the heads and hides as trophies. The villagers were hard pressed to convey the idea that it was inap- propriate to take the animals if one did not want the meat in the first place. This threatened everyone's meat supply, even if the individual animal was not "wasted." Again, biologists count eggs and band birds, gathering data which may eventually support Native claims to hunting grounds, while Yup'ik people feel that such perturbational studies offend the birds and keep them from returning. Two theo- ries here, both avowedly "conservationist," funda- mentally conflict.11 In public policy debate, the inequality of the relationship between negotiators stacks the deck in favor of the non-Native paradigm. Educational institutions and public information agencies, for example, try to convince the Yup'ik public to adopt scientific "truth."12 Native peoples have little choice but to defend the subsistence economy with harvest statistics and supporting scientific data, although they may feel that the heart of the matter has somehow been overlooked. In a clear illustra- tion of this process, Osherenko (1988: 29) describes Canadian Inuit participation in beluga manage- ment: "Although hunters had been uncomfortable about counting belugas early in the research phases (stating how many animals you expect to kill shows disrespect for the prey), they have adopted a man- agement system dependent on counting yet hinged on an important Inuit value - sharing." With re- spect to Canadian caribou comanagement, it is again the contribution to the scientific data base that is explicitly valued (Osherenko 1988:19): "Native knowledge regarding caribou health, num- bers, migratory patterns and behavior over the last several centuries is now integrated with techniques of biologists for gathering current data. . . .Native members . . . have provided remarkable expertise to governments from the first meeting."13 Since science and economics are widely per- ceived to be culture-free frameworks, a scientific defense brooks no argument, whereas a defense in terms of cultural values is difficult. This is particu- larly ironic because Western cultural values some- times affect policy decisions in an implicit and unquestioned fashion. An extended example will serve to illustrate this point. Swan Mythology and the Regulation of Swan Hunting As indicated earlier, spring is a time when Yupiit look forward to the arrival of the first migratory waterfowl. This is the primary season (in addition to opportunistic hunting during the late summer/ fall molt, when birds are flightless) when waterfowl have historically been hunted in the Delta. Yupiit note that this is still the best time to hunt birds: early spring travel by snowmachine is easier and more direct than boat travel after break-up, and the birds are easier to decoy and call at this season. Spring waterfowl hunting, however, has been illegal since 1918 under the Migratory Bird Treaty act. This act also made swan hunting illegal in the Delta in any season; in the past, punishment has included the forfeiture of game and firearms, and a fine of $500 per bird.</page><page sequence="7">44 Arctic Anthropology 29:1 Nonetheless, current tundra swan harvests in the Delta are estimated to average 6300 birds per year (Aldrich et al. 1990:3). Although this makes up only 7% of the Delta's waterfowl harvest, it amounts to 25% by weight (a per capita catch of about 4 pounds, or 1/3 of a swan). This represents about 10% of the total tundra swan population of 60,000-70,000 birds. Under this harvest, swan pop- ulations have increased slightly since 1980 (Al- drich et al. 1990:5). The winter survey of 1990, in fact, showed an increase in the population, al- though at least one researcher, an ornithologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, has expressed concern about the harvest pressure (James Sed- inger, personal communication, 1991). Enforcement of waterfowl hunting laws has always been sporadic, with local resistance some- times effectively thwarting agents' efforts. The most famous incident was the Barrow Duck-In of 1961. When several Native men including a state legislator were arrested for spring bird hunting, 300 Inupiat (138 of them holding dead eider ducks which they claimed to have taken illegally), gath- ered in the community hall (Chance 1990:146-147). Faced with arresting much of the community, en- forcement agents backed down. Yupiit remember past repression and are dis- creet about swan harvesting. The legacy of repres- sion is also kept alive in a large repertoire of folk narratives about acts of "civil disobedience," such as armed stand-offs with authorities. One ubiq- uitous story concerns shooting holes in the floats of a Fish and Wildlife sea-plane so that it is unable to land and arrest offenders (with disabled floats, the agents can only fly home, since they must beach the plane after a single landing). Such tales are told with pride and humor in the vein of "Robin Hood vs. the Sheriff's men." Mythic Associations While such incidents become incorporated into the modern folk tradition, more ancient folk beliefs play into the regulatory process itself. The swan is not particularly prominent in Yup'ik mythology and belief, but it is an important bird in Euroamerican lore. Human/animal transfor- mation and the revelation of human form in ani- mals are common themes in Yup'ik folklore (yua, "its person," is the Yup'ik terminological equiv- alent of the better-known term "inua"). The essen- tial similarities between humans and animals render transformation common. Various birds - seagulls, owls, loons and the mythological ten- gmiarpak, among others - figure prominently in songs and tales, were important in ceremonies, and are represented in numerous masks, carvings, and drawings. While certain species are highlighted, others receive less cultural focus. A goose or swan, like any other animal, has a yua, but is not sym- bolically marked, in contrast to the loon, for exam- ple, which has rich mythic and ritual associations (Morrow and Volkman 1976) and is rarely hunted. In Euroamerican lore, however, swans are members of a symbolically marked set, clearly dif- ferentiated from domesticated geese, ducks, and other fowl. While human/animal transformation occurs frequently in European lore, the human/ swan transformation motif is particularly wide- spread and frequent14 (Thompson 1958:48-61; Armstrong 1970:48-61). The most well-known cycle concerns "the metamorphosis of a beautiful half-mortal half-supernatural maiden from swan to human form" (Leach 1984:1091). A human lover who wishes to keep her in human form is generally involved. In the Grimms' (1960:178-182) and Andersen's (1958:91-108) tales, swans appear par- ticularly as transformed princes, and as symbols of beauty. "The Ugly Duckling" (Grimm and Grimm 1960:175-185), for example, is a parable about human transformation with the ideal of beauty and royalty represented by swans. Because of their royal associations, it is tradi- tional to keep swans in castle gardens, and by extension they lend an air of grace and nobility to many public parks, where lovers may also court in swan-shaped boats. Like the romantic Western ideal for humans, swans are believed to mate for life; killing one of a pair condemns the other to a life of mourning and is a reprehensible act. In gen- eral, killing swans may be subtly equivalent to murder. In Ireland, for example, "bad luck attends the swan-killer. It was believed that the souls of people become embodied in swans" (Armstrong 1970:48). In the ballet Swan Lake this message is also made overt: the hunter Prince Siegfried falls in love with Odette, who has been transformed into a swan along with her retinue; his companions almost shoot the women, whose grace is such that even in human form they are mistaken for swans (Untermeyer 1968:47-49). These cultural reso- nances are undoubtedly ancient: swans in Aesop's fables (1988:118,190) are associated with beauty and prescience, and in Greek mythology, Leda (Leto) was raped by Zeus in the form of a swan. As might be expected, swans are not usually classified as a food item for Euroamericans. The exceptions, interestingly, relate to their associa- tions with nobility: in England, only the royal fam- ily and the members of St. John's College, Cam- bridge, are allowed to eat swans (Jennifer Cole, St. John's alumna, personal communication, 1990). Obviously and predictably, the folkloric strands of belief are associational, rather than defin- itive. Swans were certainly eaten historically by Euroamericans; market hunting prior to the 1918 law drove trumpeter populations nearly to extinc- tion, and depressed tundra swan populations as well.15 It is possible that the current revival of feel-</page><page sequence="8">Morrow and Hensel: Hidden Dissension 45 ing about swans may relate in part to the many years of publicity surrounding the Audobon Soci- ety's successful attempt to save the trumpeter from extinction. However, it must be noted that the salva- tion effort was undoubtedly enhanced by the my- thology as well. The public is more likely to donate money to preserve and protect species classified as beautiful, "cute," anthropomorphic, intelligent, and/or prominent in folklore and children's liter- ature (whales, seals, wolves, pandas, and swans) than those deemed unattractive (e.g., endangered insects). The drive to save the snail darter, for instance, was often publicly ridiculed. We would argue that swans are regulated dif- ferently from ducks and geese because of the unex- amined folkloric connections in the culture of the regulators. If population figures were actually the basis for setting bag limits, it would have been log- ical to legally sanction swan hunting. Specifically, swan populations remained quite high during the period of long term decline of several species of geese in the Delta. Cackling Canada geese (also known as Lesser Canadian geese), most notably, went from a high of 364,000 in 1965 to a low of 25,800 in 1984 (Pamplin 1986:487). In response to this decline, Native nonprofit corporations, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and California sports hunting and conservation groups entered the Hooper Bay Agreement of 1984, which became the Yukon- Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management Plan in 1985 (Pamplin 1986:48-49). The effective elimination of goose egg gathering and the reduction of hunting have contributed to the incipient recovery of these protected species. However, at no time were subsis- tence hunters ever officially encouraged to sub- stitute the hunting of swans for that of the en- dangered species. Swan regulation, then, seems to be influenced by an unacknowledged interplay of other cultural attitudes with scientific rationality. On the one hand, swans are generally protected; on the other, they are occasionally opened to hunting where sports hunters have been sufficiently voluble (in a time of generally declining wild waterfowl re- sources, there is public pressure to provide some viable population for such citizens to hunt). At present, Utah, Montana, and Nevada have swan seasons, and Alaska is conducting a trial hunt on the Seward Peninsula (Aldrich et al. 1990:2-3). In the Delta, swan hunting is officially forbidden, but usually tacitly ignored. This inconsistency sug- gests that there is discomfort, at some level, with an "irrational" policy. Why then, has the Yup'ik public not chal- lenged swan regulation in the Delta? The answer may be two-fold. First, Yupiit are well aware of the disgust most Euroamericans feel at the thought of eating swans. Since their first encounters with Kass'at, they have been condemned for eating raw, fermented, and frozen foods, customs which are negatively associated with a "primitive" culture. As a result, discretion in the taking and eating of swans is only one manifestation of a general reluc- tance to eat these Native foods in the presence of non-Natives.16 By remaining quiet on the subject, Yupiit in general, and members of regulatory boards in particular, may avoid the risk of being treated as inferiors. Conclusions: Constrained Arguments and Cultural Survival In sum, a variety of factors contribute to the con- cealment of ethnocentrism. Resource managers eth- nocentrically assume that Yupiit will have certain "non-rational" beliefs about game animals, while being comparatively unaware of their own cultural biases. The regulators canonize the biological model of population dynamics even when, as is often true in the Arctic, population figures are sketchy, variables are numerous, and the dynamics are not well understood, all leaving sufficient room for the influence of Western beliefs in making actual management decisions. This compounds the general problem of the imposition of Western assumptions about what constitutes tradition, conservation, etc. Yup'ik explanations of the problem are variously unknown to scientists, dismissed, regarded as charming but irrelevant metaphors, or seen as obstacles to be overcome. For example, when addressing the Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working Group (Sample A, Appendix), Joseph Lomack explained that he knew chum salmon were more numerous than biologists claimed. He struggled to express the distinction between "biology way" and "Eskimo biology way," but did not expect to be understood or accepted. "Maybe not agree," he said. "Nobody could agree with me, I think, on that. I talking about their Eskimo way." This did not provoke discussion. Instead, it was followed by a long pause, an audible sigh, and the (non-Native) chair's invitation to "Other discussion?" Differences in communicative style, which are an intimate part of what is being communi- cated, are often similarly disregarded. For example, the lengthy narratives which Yup'ik elders tell at public meetings often detail current situations, viewpoints, ethnohistorical knowledge, and ap- peals to values in the form of indirect parables that they want planners and fellow villagers to consider in the context of a proposed plan. There is often reluctance to "make the bad thing worse" by speaking about negative aspects of proposed policies; there exists a general idea that one's verbalization can become actualized (Morrow,</page><page sequence="9">46 Arctic Anthropology 29:1 n.d.). Throughout Samples A and B (Appendix), Yupiit speak positively about the fish, in contrast to the non-Natives, who repeatedly voice their con- cern that fish populations may be in decline. Gen- eral deference conventions also contribute to a hesitancy to disagree openly and directly. As a result, planners often dismiss the import of testi- mony which may seem like a lengthy digression, or evidence that a speaker does not understand the issues, or is simply being stubborn. Efforts then focus on educating Natives, a stance liable to be interpreted as paternalistic. There are anthropologists, including those who work for the Alaska State Department of Fish and Game Division of Subsistence, who do de- scribe cultural values in their monographs; none- theless, it is their collection and presentation of harvest data which carries official weight (Fienup-Riordan 1982, 1983; Andrews 1989; Wolfe 1989). Similarly, the Alaska Eskimo Whal- ing Commission could only respond to imposed limits on whale harvests by arguing that bowheads had been seriously undercounted17 and that the population could, in fact, sustain a low-level har- vest. Such arguments are considered admissible evidence in the debate; cultural attitudes carry less credibility. Currently, the challenge of Alaska Natives (as stated in a recent news broadcast) is to prove that "we need subsistence resources more than urban non-Native Alaskans do." In effect, the grounds on which one can argue the issue are shrinking, in- creasingly reduced to this question of economic necessity. It is easy to predict that if economic opportunities increase in rural Alaska, this last defense of subsistence priorities is likely to fail. In fact, an evolutionary model of societies is often heard in this context, expressed as "allowing peo- ple the opportunity to participate in economic development." In sum, Yup'ik people regard the non-Yup'ik paradigm as a power with which they must deal, although the degree to which they are forced to adopt its jargon is unrecognized. Non-Yup'ik peo- ple operate without recognizing or validating Yup'ik paradigms, while their own biases remain implicit. Given the structure of this relationship, one must question whether any subsistence rights that are saved by science will include what Alaska Native people most want to preserve: subsistence as a way of relating to the world and as an important component of identity. Furthermore, any legal rec- ognition of "custom and tradition" inevitably restricts future action by its effort to define custom in ever more restrictive terms as precedents are tested in court. Thus, the greatest effect of hidden dissension may be that winning on another's terms, the best that can be hoped for, ultimately resembles losing. Acknowledgements. The germ of this paper was in Morrow (1987). It was elaborated in collo- quium presentations at Cornell University, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Hensel developed the example of swan regulation separately, and the two papers, here combined, were presented at the American Anthropological Association meetings in 1990. Thanks to all who read or heard and com- mented upon these earlier versions, especially Robert Ascher, Bart Garber, Carol Greenhouse, John Gumperz, Bernd Lambert, Mary C. Pete, Thomas C. Rothe, James Sedinger, and Robert J. Wolfe. The present version has benefited from the comments of Ernest Burch, Jr. and two other (anonymous) reviewers. Appendix At the Negotiating Table: Two Discourse Samples The devaluation of Native testimony and the con- current validation of non-Native testimony is abun- dantly clear throughout the on-going dialogue about resource management.18 The two examples which follow are drawn from field notes and from official tapes of public meetings of the Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working Group, a co- management forum intended to put commercial and subsistence fishermen, processors, and man- agers together at the negotiating table. It is necessary to introduce these transcripts with a few comments to facilitate reading. The speakers include: Joseph Lomack, Sr. (Kuskokwim Fisherman 's Cooperative, Yup'ik,); Kim Francisco (fisheries biologist, non-Native); John White (co- chair, non-Native); Frank Charles (fisherman, audience member, Yup'ik); Michael Chase (Elder Representative, Yup'ik); and Evon Fox (Kuskokwim United Fisherman's Association, Yup'ik). Fifteen to thirty people attended these meetings, held two to three times a week at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Bethel. These negotiations are frequently charac- terized by opaque exchanges, where interpretation is problematic because of linguistic as well as cul- tural differences. Many of the speakers would have been more eloquent in Yup'ik, but the language of this public forum was English. In fact, the use of Yup'ik during sessions was discouraged: when one participant tried to translate a portion of the pro- ceedings for another, the chair presumed that the two were caucusing and asked them to postpone their discussion. Lomack, in particular, is difficult to understand. Nonetheless, a knowledge of Yup'ik and of Yup'ik-influenced English makes it possible for us to understand most of what he says. That participants were required to use English, that an interpreter was not provided, and that clarification</page><page sequence="10">Morrow and Hensel: Hidden Dissension 47 was never requested, all reflect the political dimen- sions of the Native/non-Native relationship.19 To appreciate the nature and difficulty of these interchanges, it is useful to first read the dialogue aloud, before reading the annotations, which are keyed by roman numerals. Joseph Lomack's speech is easier to understand if the repeated expression "on that" is omitted (in his usage, this functions as a speech marker roughly equivalent to a vocal pause such as "you know"). A very simple transcription system has been used: a few words that were particularly empha- sized are underlined; hyphens mark false starts; and words clear from context are inserted in brackets. The dialogue was divided into paragraphs sig- nalled by a pause plus a slight change of topic. Overlapping speech (which was rare in this formal setting) is indented at the point of overlap. Much is happening in these exchanges, and commentary on a variety of aspects would be possi- ble. The focus has been narrowed here to certain germane points which are discussed in the text. Sample A: Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Workshop Meeting. June 22, 1991- U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Offices, Bethel, Alaska Context: the accuracy of the biologists' counts of king salmon is being questioned. Joseph Lomack, Sr: Ah, Mr. Chairman, on Jast week on that they had a fishing ah, in the front of that Bethel. From ah, from the line from BetheJ all the way up to ah, Akiachuk, and he pass by, the thick one. We didn't have any tester on that, and not get the fish, we get lot offish running. He jumped up, that's a good sign, that means thick, and not ah biology way, [but] the Eskimo biology way. (I) Now right now on that, they get sometimes on that in the Tuiuksak [River] that water is not much good on that ah, from upstream, and the Kwethluk [River] they're get upstream on that, get lots of water. And the fish, they're going up. That best time to get when the water is- is getting high on that. The best time to going up to all the way. And [but] when it get low water, other fishermen he kill the- many of the Kis-1 mean the fish. They're eat [by] black bear and brown bear, thaVs a good fisherman, before it [the fish] get roe on that one, he [the bears] eat it up on that, many of them. When it get low water, when it get low water, he [the fish] backing up on that, he don't make much roe, I'm talking about their Eskimo way. (II) Right now he get thick on that- the last week on that, and ah they're pretty good on that, know you - when it get normal way on that, we - the - the fish they're coming on that wind direction, on that you tell us about. (Ill) Maybe not agree, ah- ah- nobody could agree with me, I think on that. (IV) And i- Í talking about their Eskimo way. John White: (Loud sigh, pause] Other discussion? (V) Lomack's argument may be summarized as follows: I. There are clear signs of abundant fish. Local people know that there was sufficient escape- ment. This is based on experience, not on offi- cial counts. II. Tuiuksak River weir counts are low because fish will not ascend in low water conditions. He implies that the (sentient) fish are avoiding bear predation. On the adjacent system, where water levels are higher, fish are ascending normally. III. More fish will come when the wind changes. IV. He does not expect to be heeded. V. Chairman White does not comment. His sigh and invitation to "other discussion" seem to support Lomack's prediction that he will not be heeded. Sample B: July 8, 1991 Context: The Commissioner of the Alaska Depart- ment of Fish and Game is hearing testimony in response to overharvesting of Kuskokwim-bound salmon by fishermen in the False Pass area. There is larger than usual attendance and sometimes palpa- ble tension. Topic of discussion is the wording of a motion to delay or close the next fishing period. John White: Other discussion on the motion? Yeah, Kim? Kim Francisco: Mr. Chairman, yeah ah- Perhaps my recom- mendation needs a small bit of clarification. I es- sentially agree with what David just said and that was- that was- Í was saying that we needed to back off until we had clear evidence of- that things are better than they are now. John White: Frank. You have anything new? (I) Frank Charles: Well, I just wanted to make a clarification. I thought Í heard you state in your recommendation that, you know, we may be looking to closing it up until Coho management- (II) (INAUDIBLE) Kim Francisco, very emphatically: -If things don't ever improve, yes, that's a possibility. (Ill) John White: Mike Chase.</page><page sequence="11">48 Arctic Anthropology 29:1 Mike Chase: Ah, I- I just want to say that ah, you know, Í think there's fish out there, you know. Ah, ever since Í start fishing, you know, I start fishing from way back, and if there's no fish yet, even you set your net out, you don't get any, but there's - in this last period I didn't get lot offish, but there's steady stream offish, you know. You get- on a drift you get three, four of them. If there's no fish, you wouldn't get any, so there's fish. (IV) And one thing- one thing you got to remember is we had North wind, you know, and the water was clear. (V) And the fish aren't dumb, you know. They- they can elude the net any way they want to, be- cause they've seen it, because they- that's their- you know, just like us, they live in that water. And they see everything what's down there, so you know- you know. (VI) I told you before, Kim, you don't swim with the fish and see where they go, you know, but Í think we shouldn't- like you said- we shouldn't close this fishery. Just say that through your study that it- the fish aren't passing through. (VII) I think we should all, you know- pitch in together and see, what- what- goes before we decide what we're going to do with the fishery, you know, the river, for this year. (VIII) And I-Just like you say, there's spots offish where the subsistence fishermen get their fish. It's true, but ah- it doesn't happen all over the river. Like this morning, one of my boys went out fishing, in five minutes, less than five minutes he got over 100 chums, you know, reds and chums. So that's- that'll tell you. (IX) When you said at first that through subsis- tence users' reports, you know, you're just putting it, you know, putting your stamp on it, and you know it's there, but we want to tell you that, you know, we know, because we live here way before you came here. We eat, and our kids grow up on it, you know, and we know. (X) It could be, the chum, you know, they could hit if this North wind is not blowing all the time, you know. That's just all I want to say is that one. The other thing, you know, Í didn't have a chance to talk to that commissioner over there. You know what, you know- I've been into meetings into Anchorage, hearings [on] False Pass [fishery]. You know we're just little people over here, what they call us, little people. We don't have much money to flash around over there in Anchorage. The guys from down there, you know, they come in with a gold watch, gold ring, you know, and they've got vests, and they walk around with a cigar in their mouths, and they- when somebody talks, people listen [to them] {XÌ){BR1EF PAUSE WHILE TAPE TURNED}- hurts all of us, you know, it doesn't add up, you're not with us, you just said. You know Í don't talk much, you know, when they're at meet- ing, but I listen. You- you said you're- not going to take some actions. But I think, you know, you're talking about, kids, because we don't make over $5000 fishing. And those guys down there make over $2- 300,000, you know, fishing. You know we've got kids just like anybody else, we try to feed them. And what statements you have made, it has lots of weight to the guys that's listening here. Í know, because I work with my people for a long time. I don't- like I say, I don't say much, but I listen, I know what's going on. I know what kind of person, you know, when they talk, what kind of person they are. That's all I have to say. Thank you. (XII) John White: Thank you, Mike. Joe Lomack? Joseph Lomack, St.: Yeah, Mr. Chairman, what I'm thinking on that one, I know what Í- when I'm little boy, these are the kids on that. They go wrong. The fish is running down there, and the water is very clear. Right now on that the people, he need money. 1 come down to meeting to help our people. Now the North wind, is not much fish. The south, uh, south wind he tell us truth about this winter. They're a 'coming. He take all that Akulurak fisherman down there, they call on- that's False Pass, and when I little boy he talking about that one, and the fish is coming through to that, to here to Kusquqvak, spread it out on those in a pie, and he tell us many times. (XIII) Right now on that, the fish he'll be- the wind he get change, he get more fish there com- ing up to our- help people on that, ah, this coming Friday, on that what I'm thinking. (XIV) Maybe nobody go with me, I think, about that one. The people he really need for that one, I kind of depending on those other children. (XV) And the governor he tell us when we hurt, the people, "help your people," the council, to help them on those job. One job, that's only get fishing on that, that's only for the people without job on that, just only can beg it, it's for the winter and for stove oil and for grub for the winter. Right now, on that, the fish, they're a 'coming. Who's going to take them? (XVI) We can not to boss to the fishing down there, coming on this way get thick one. South wind he tell us about this winter and the fall. But they're get, the fish they're a 'com- ing then. Eh, but we know, I talking not about that Kass'aq way, I talking about their Eskimo way, right now, about their- this winter in the North. He tell us about North is not much fish. In the East, in the East and those they're sometimes on that the South wind. Before those coming in the fish, there before get break up. When the South wind, old timers they tell us</page><page sequence="12">Morrow and Hensel: Hidden Dissension 49 about, "Oh, yeah, that- that's a good on that- thay's a good sign, the fish he coming towards to the Kuskokwim River." Never change when Í JittJe boy, I'm get old timer right now, never change. He tell us about like this on that. Some day, no temperature. No temperature he talking about. Some day when he break up, the ice, before it get break up. The fish running underneath king salmon, be/ore it get break up. After that, it'll bring to the starvation. I never forget those words from the old timers and old, old lady tell me the truth. Thank you. (XVII) John White: Thank you, Mr. Lomack. Any other discussion on the motion? E von Fox: Mi- John White: Evon Fox. E von Fox: Yeah, ¡follow up on them guys, Mike Chase and Joe Lomack. (XVIII) There's some fish out there in the river. Last- since the spring, the water is clear all the time, and when ¡fill up the bucket and couple of hours, just like the rainwater. Right now, since couple of days, it's clouding up, from upriver. I-it's gonna- I think it's going to help the fish. More fish next period. It's clouding up now, couple days in the water- Í watch them pretty close for fish. I think some of them [others who have testified?] watching, too. ¡follow up that [suggestion], this coming Friday, open up the fish- ing. That's all. {XIX) John White: Any body else? [pausej I'll take my crack at it. We've been talking about there not being enough chum salmon ever since the first period. Every- body's had a reason to say that there's some there, but every time we put the fleet out there, we're hard pressed to harvest 50,000 fish. Everybody that comes to this table, there's a point where they've got to make a decision that there's not enough fish, because one of the things that we have to decide here is when there's not enough fish. I've made the decision right now, based upon what the fleet has shown us, that I think we've got to get more fish in the river before we fish again. I don't support this motion, but I'll support a motion that we meet again on Friday to review any new information. (XX) That's all 1 have, is there any other discussion on the motion? If there's no other discussion on the motion, the chair will hear the motion. Summary of Sample B: I. John White recognizes Frank Charles with the implication that FC's remarks may be redundant. II. FC counters KF's assertion that things may never improve. Fish will come; they are just not here yet. III. KF counters with an even stronger negative assertion. IV. This is followed by MC's strong assertion that there are fish. V. MC gives reasons why the fish temporarily seem to be less abundant, using same obser- vations as Lomack (Sample A, June 22). VI. A reminder that the fish are aware and responsive. VII. Concern with the power of words, i.e. "Do not say that the fish are not there; just say that they are not passing through the biolo- gists' test points." VIII. An appeal to solidarity and consensus. IX. There are signs that there are fish. X. Managers disregard users' reports, "rubber- stamping" them, but they should be given more weight than the biologists' data. XI. The words of people with economic clout and a flashy style are taken seriously; Native words are disregarded. [Contextual note: The Commissioner is wearing a gold nugget-studded watch and ring.] XII. MC states repeatedly that he is aware of the power of words and uses his speech reserv- edly (in contrast to the commissioner). He suggests that his speech should be validated especially because he listens much more than he speaks. The Commissioner should be careful about what he says, and make decisions that will benefit "the little people." XIII. Lomack may be suggesting that the Commis- sioner and other non-Natives are like chil- dren in their inexperience. He (an "old- timer") speaks with the authority of age and local knowledge that has stood the test of tradition. He repeats reasons for the tem- porarily low catches. Gesturing in the direc- tion of False Pass, he describes a pie-shaped wedge in the air, representing the route of the fish. XIV. Again, the fish are sentient and respond to human need. XV. Yupiit have to depend on those who are like children to make important decisions for them. Again, he does not expect to be heeded. XVI. The fish are coming in response to people's need. When they come, they must be taken; a decision to close the fishery will allow them to pass and they may be offended and not return in future. XVII. A time when fish will not come has been foreseen, and impending starvation is pre- dictable from certain weather conditions. Present conditions, however, indicate that this is not that time.</page><page sequence="13">50 Arctic Anthropology 29:1 XVIII. Fox corroborates previous speakers and moves that the fishery be opened that Friday. XIX. The three older Yup'ik men reference each other, a standard Yup'ik way of demonstrat- ing consensus and validity. XX. White states that the evidence shows that there are not enough fish and that it is the group's responsibility to admit this. He does not support Fox's motion. Endnotes 1. The authors draw on extended field experience in southwestern Alaska, having lived in the Bethel area for 11 years, in addition to continuing research and field contacts in the five years since. Through- out, they have focused on issues of language and culture. Currently, Hensel is examining the sym- bolic meanings of subsistence, and Morrow is researching Yup'ik epistemology and linguistic conflicts in the courts. 2. Listening to a National Park Ranger's lecture on the history of bear management, Morrow was struck by the unconscious parallels between images of Natives and those of predators in relation to changing federal policy. In the North American context, images of "the Native" have both reflected and been used to manipulate attitudes towards wild animals, and by extension, game management pol- icies. At the same time that "wild savages" were being exterminated as threats to American expan- sion, "wild animals" were indiscriminately slaugh- tered. Reservations and national parks reflected a later policy of circumscribing and, to some extent, romanticizing "wild" peoples and animals. Animal rights and civil rights also arrived on the scene roughly contemporaneously. The latest image of Natives is as the "original ecologists." Native con- ceptions of animals as interrelated with humans have been fundamental to this image. As embodied in ecological politics and rhetoric, however, this notion causes conflict. In American symbolic cate- gorization, with its Judeo-Christian roots, animals are subordinate to humans. One allowance for kill- ing and/or eating animals is lost when they are ele- vated to coequal (or, as in the case of whales, even superior) status. Cognitive dissonance results, then, when Natives hunt the very animals (e.g. , whales, bears, young seals, wolves) that have become almost totemically iconographic in the environmental movement. A common consequence of this sudden dissonance is that, as will be shown, contemporary Natives are redefined as inauthentic and less noble. 3. The self-designation Yup'ik (sing.), meaning "real person," is pronounced with a geminated /p/ as indicated by the apostrophe, which is often left out in English. A linguistic variant of this form is Yupiaq, which is occasionally seen in the liter- ature. In the plural form (Yupiit), the double vowel indicates that the /p/ is automatically geminated. This group has been designated by other names as well, such as "Yuit" or "Yute" which means "peo- ple" (properly written as Yuut in the standard orthography). The linguistic designation is Central Alaskan Yupik, which distinguishes these people from speakers of Siberian Yupik and Alutiiq (Jacob- son 1984:1). 4. Compare Brody (1975:7-13) in which White and Inuit remedies for a case of sexual misconduct involving a teacher are contrasted. 5. Linguistically, this is consistent with the pre- dominance of nominal and stative forms in English vs. the predominance of verbal/processual and qualified/indirect expressions in Yup'ik, a contrast in itself contributing to the problems of translation in legal cases. 6. For example, there have been at least two recent child sexual abuse cases tried in Alaskan courts which have included testimony about potentially relevant customary practices. Genital touching while teasing and tickling young children was reported, by some Yupiit, as customary but neither sexual nor exploitative. Other Yupiit, either un- aware of such a practice or aware that genital touch- ing is legally defined as sexual abuse, denied its existence. When defense lawyers argued that the actions of the defendants were within the bounds of culturally appropriate behavior, a storm of public debate ensued. Community discussion among non- Natives during this period was confused or con- demnatory; the apparent disagreement in the Native community led non-Natives to conclude that abuse was poorly understood and/or poorly regu- lated. Similar judgements are also offered in legal argumentation. In one brief opposing the recogni- tion of customary adoption (Dan-Conlon vs. State of Alaska, case 3AE-87-06505, August, 1988), for example, the state claimed generally that Alaska Native villages have "no adequate machinery for enforcing law and order." 7. Case (1984:276) notes the tension in concepts of "cultural or social value" and "tradition or custom" as interpreted in subsistence legislation. He com- ments that "tradition and custom imply that a cer- tain degree of permanence or at least only gradual evolution is characteristic of [cultural! values" and that only "limited transformation" is possible. The requirement that custom be codified is implicit in the language of Federal statute 28 U.S.C. 1360c, which is cited in relation to sovereignty issues. This statute recognizes Native American jurisdic-</page><page sequence="14">Morrow and Hensel: Hidden Dissension 51 tion as follows: "Any tribal ordinance or custom heretofore or hereafter adopted by an Indian tribe, band, or community in the exercise of any authority which it may possess shall, if not inconsistent with any applicable civil law of the state, be given full force and effect in the determination of civil causes pursuant to this section." The language in effect demands the existence of a parallel legal structure (a recognized body and an enforcement power) without recognizing that this demand is, in itself, hegemonic. Morrow and Pete (1991) give a case example showing how Alaska's "recognition" of customary adoption invokes these principles and, by codifying practice, limits its flexibility and responsiveness to change. 8. A young man from the same village where this incident occurred expressed considerable psycho- logical distress in the face of contradictions be- tween the systems. Whenever endangered or out of season birds are within range, he said, "I feel guilty when I shoot and I feel guilty when I don't shoot." The one violates Western law, the other Yup'ik morality. 9. It is no surprise, then, that the Yup'ik terms used as equivalents carry differing connotations, adding to the complexity of the communication. Often, too, contested concepts like "subsistence" and "conservation" frame debates without there being explicit mention of the terms themselves, as seen in our extended discourse sample. 10. This quotation is taken from a portion of the transcript of the Kuskokwim River Salmon Man- agement Working Group, June 22, 1991, which is not included in the appendix to this paper. These statements, too, reflect the idea that fish are highly sentient. 11. Fienup-Riordan (1990) provides a relevant dis- cussion of Yup'ik conceptions of human-animal relationships in relation to management issues. 12. In the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, a host of edu- cational materials have been produced, including a Fish and Wildlife comic book which features a biol- ogist leading a group of children through the steps of field research and explaining the migration of birds along the Pacific fly way. In Canada, as well, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans "chose to guide the users by providing information on the species and management techniques and encourag- ing the users to adopt management measures" in preference to imposing regulations and enforce- ment actions (Osherenko 1988:28). 13. Even when Natives do not present their knowl- edge in scientific terms, per se, their statements are used only to bolster scientifically-based arguments. See, for example, Albrecht's (1990) sanguine as- sessment of the success of the Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working Group, which does not take into account the hidden conflicts we high- light here. 14. Thompson motif D361. 1, the swan-maiden; D161.1, transformation: manto swan. 15. One Fish and Game biologist stated that the rationale for banning the hunting of tundra swans in the Delta was that hunters might misidentify them as trumpeter swans. Actually, however, trum- peters do not nest in the Delta, where 90% of Alaska's swan harvest occurs. 16. Compare Brody (1975:164): "The Whites' dis- like for raw meat, their bizarre way of bending for- wards when eating, their preoccupation with clean cups and their vast wealth and political authority are all blended together." 17. This was later scientifically corroborated by visual and acoustic counts (Clark 1991:40), which helped to reinforce the expediency of using the bio- logical paradigm. It is commonplace for courts and regulatory agencies to solicit and accept the testi- mony of social scientists more readily than that of indigenous people locally recognized as experts. At these times, this practice discomfits both Native and outside experts. 18. Sociolinguistic studies showing the subtle devaluation of some speakers (who gets the floor, how topics are introduced, recognized and/or dis- missed) constitutes a large literature. Many of Gumperz's contributions to the understanding of communication in general, and interethnic com- munication in particular, are fundamental here (these include, most recently, Gumperz 1989; Gum- perz and Roberts n.d.). In the Northern context, Scollon and Scollon's work (1979, 1980, 1981) is also apropos, particularly in relation to quantity of talk. 19. Susan Gal offers a now classic discussion of the relationship between language choice and politi- cal-economic identity. Her work demonstrates that "acceptance of the authority and prestige of the state language depends on the political-economic position of the minority group with respect to the state and the regional economy" (1987:649). In terms of the gross hegemonic force of English, this is certainly true in the Yup'ik-speaking area. Dis- course analysis, a rather nontechnical example of which is presented here, yields other, micro-level insights. These suggest that social interactional practices, of which a preference for positive phras- ing is one example, develop within a speech com- munity and subsequently play an important role in the developing patterns of discourse between mem- bers of differing speech communities.
