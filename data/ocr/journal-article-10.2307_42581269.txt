VI, No. 3 SPRING, 1949 ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND GENERAL SEMANTICS ANATOL RAPOPORT1 ALFONSO SHIMBEL1 The Importance of (Bastard) Sciences IN of A labor, society there where is likely great to emphasis develop a is notion placed that on specialization knowledge and and techniques division of labor, there is likely to develop a notion that knowledge and techniques fall into 'natural' divisions, each pertaining to some discrete, well-defined as- pect of living. The general semanticist will, of course, take issue with the 'naturalness' of the divisions. Like any other classification, division of know- ledge and techniques into autonomous specialties can be justified for the general semanticist only on pragmatic grounds. Instead of asking, 'What are the "nat- ural" divisions?' he will ask, 'Given such and such classification, what can be achieved?' The achievements of specialization are evident. Modern science and industry are so complex and the standards of scholarship so exacting that it is impossible for any one to master more than a narrow sector of knowledge. If achievements are measured by the extent to which man can know and manipulate his en- vironment, then the pragmatic justification for specialization has been given. However, there is also a sordid side to specialization. As Norbert Wiener has pointed out, A man may be a topologist or an acoustician or a coleopterist. He will be filled with the jargon of his field and will know all its literature, and all its ramifications, but, more frequently than not, he will regard the next subject as something belonging to his colleague three doors down 1 Committee on Mathematical Biology, University of Chicago. 145</page><page sequence="2">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS the corridor, and will consider any interest in it on his own part as an unwarrantable breach of privacy.2 The notions your field' and my field' carry with them two unfortunate im- plications. To begin with, such 'cubicle' thinking bears a disturbing resemblance to the process of severe 'inbreeding' with its accompanying tendency to loss of vigor. The damaging results of this tendency are not too serious, inasmuch as they are confined to the devitalization of a limited number of qualified scientists and scholars. The second implication has more serious consequences. Specialization be- comes institutionalized. The innumerable '-ologies' provide a framework for the administrative apparatus of our institutions of learning. As is usual, the administrative structure is even more static than the conceptual hierarchies of the academicians, so that attempts on the part of non-conformists to commit 'breaches of academic privacy' are countered not only by the resentments of the 'specialists' but also by the formidable forces of administrative authority. Such are the effects of elementalistic orientation on learning and science. The effects of either-or attitudes are no less telling and are the more profound the farther removed is a field of endeavor from the emancipated, non-aristo- telian areas of physical science. In the latter it is generally recognized that a 'theory' is not 'reality' ; it does not even describe reality but is only a set of directions for manipulating symbols in order to make predictions. Thus the existence of 'equivalent' theories is possible. In other disciplines, however, par- ticularly in those dealing with human behavior, the tendency is to view each new formulation suspiciously as a 'rival' theory, whose establishment auto- matically invalidates and dates existing formulations. We have Marxists and Keynesians, Gestaltists and Behaviorists, Freudians, Adlerians, Jungians, and neo-Freudians. One could almost suspect that a jealous and malicious god was deliberately trying to interfere with the construction of the Tower of Science by confusing the language of the builders. The general semanticist, aware as he is of the limitations inherent in ele- mentalistic and either-or approaches to problems, seeks a way of unifying vari- ous points of view, of creating a new language, if necessary, for a more ade- quate description of the world. Therefore the general semanticist welcomes the rise of bastard sciences. What are some of these hybrid disciplines and wherein lies the power of their method? As an early example, one might cite euclidean geometry, the first cross be- tween empirical mathematics and formal logic. Mathematics had existed in Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations merely as a description of certain experiences (measurement) and sets of rules for computation. Formal logic, as developed by Aristotle, was little more than a set of rules for making classi- 2 Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics . New York: John Wiley, 1948. 146</page><page sequence="3">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND GENERAL SEMANTICS fications. But formal logic applied to a few fundamental postulates of geometry resulted in a magnificent structure of knowledge. Another example is the cross between algebra and geometry accomplished by Descartes on November 10, 1619. The discovery of a profound correspond- ence reflected in a formal isomorphism between the language of algebra and that of geometry enabled mathematicians to translate discoveries made in one field into progress in another field. As is usually the case, progress made under such circumstances is non-additive.' Other examples are equally illuminating: mathematical physics, biological chemistry, physiological psychology, biophysics, etc. Two of these areas are quite new. One is mathematical biophysics ;s the other has been christened cybernetics by Norbert Wiener and his associates and has at this time about a decade of research behind it. These two bastard sciences are of particular interest to the general semanti- cist for two reasons. First, they bear out the principle that a non-elementalistic approach to any field of inquiry is likely to yield 'non-additive' dividends. Thus the general semanticist sees in the fruits of mathematical biophysics and of cybernetics a vindication of non-elementalistic methodology. This is true, of course, of many other such cross-bred disciplines. But mathematical biophysics and cybernetics have even more important implications for general semantics. The understanding of the events in the nervous system and analogous systems as determined by their structure is fundamental for the understanding of ab- straction, evaluation, and communication, processes of basic importance in gene- ral semantics. Mathematical thinking and Human Affairs Jn 1923 Korzybski wrote as follows: If there is to be a science of human engineering, it must be mathe- matical in spirit and in method and if we do not possess methods to apply mathematical thinking to human affairs, such methods must be dis- covered. Can this be done? Let us say a word about what has already been accomplished in this direction. The latest researches in the foundations of mathematics, chiefly accomplished by Whitehead, Russell, Poincar√©, and Keyser, have dis- closed the insufficiency and fallacies of the traditional logic and have produced an internal revolution in logic and mathematics. Mathematics and logic have proved to be one; a fact from which it seems to follow that mathematics may successfully deal with non-quantitative problems in a much broader sense than was suspected to be possible.4 3 A research unit in mathematical biophysics was formed at the University of Chicago in 1935. It is now organized as the Committee on Mathematical Biology. 4 A. Korzybski, 'Fate and Freedom,' as quoted in The Language of Wisdom and Folly, Irving J. Lee, editor. 147</page><page sequence="4">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS Elaborating this confidence in the mathematical method as a tool for study- ing man, Korzy bski said in 1933: The problems of the world in 1933 are acute and immediate, over- loaded with confusion, bitterness, hopelessness, and other forms of se- mantic disturbances. Without some means - and in this case, scientific and physiological means - to regulate our semantic reactions, we shall not be able to solve our problems soon enough to avoid disasters. The similarity in structure of mathematics, and our nervous system, once pointed out and applied, gives us a unique means to regulate the semantic reactions, without which it is practically impossible to analyse dispassion- ately and wisely the most pressing problems of immediate importance.5 All in all, Korzybski's conjectures (conjectures, because of the fragmentary knowledge then available of the similarity of structure between mathematics and the human nervous system) can be summarized in a few principles.6 1. Communication between human beings is possible. That is to say, a language can be constructed in which the relations between events in the outside world can be symbolized in such a way that independent observers will arrive at similar symbolizations and by manipulating the symbols according to the rules of the language will arrive at similar conclusions. Kor- zybski cites mathematics as an example of such a language. A generalization of mathematics is any symbolic system built on structure and order relations alone. 2. The world is knowable. Any symbolization of events leads us to expect that certain things will hap- pen. But only certain ways of symbolizing lead to predictions which are actually verified. Such self-justifying symbolizations constitute knowledge. 3. Knowledge is the establishment of ordered structure. The perception, interpretation, and evaluation of events is largely a neural process (although actually the whole organism is involved in the act of know- ing) . 'Knowledge' consists of an ordered sequence of neuromotor events. 4. Order determines sanity. Sanity is a measure of the correspondence between the ordered structure of the neuro-motor events and the ordered structure of the world. Knowledge as Ordered Structure FOR first: the knowledge purposes is of the this establishment discussion, the of ordered third principle structure. will be considered first: knowledge is the establishment of ordered structure. * A. Korzybski, Science and Sanity, 2nd edition, p. 273. * Not to be confused with the 'non-aristotelian postulates.' The authors believe these principles to underlie the 'jumping off' platform of Korzybski's formulation. In the course of the formulation, he arrives at the necessity of constructing a 'non-aristotelian system.' The non-aristotelian postulates are then offered as the foundations of the system. 148</page><page sequence="5">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND GENERAL SEMANTICS The naive, pre-scientific approach to the explanation of phenomena was through the invention of anthropomorphic 'agencies' which were implicitly taken to be sufficient causes. The predominant question was 'Who does it?' not 'What is being done?' And, of course, the nature of the questions determined the limitation of the answers. The quest for 'agencies' yielded a world peopled by river-gods and fates. The reason one cannot point to a time when 'Who does it?' gave way to 'What is being done?' is that in spite of the verbal dichotomy between the two kinds of questions, the change of attitude was a gradual one. Although formally modern science can be said to be entirely based on the question in the form of 'What is being done?' yet the remnants of the 'Who does it?' attitude are still deeply intrenched in many areas of inquiry. The agencies no longer appear in anthropomorphic garb, but they are still subjects of sentences, whose subject- predicate structure almost forces the perpetuation of the old outlook and of its limitations.7 The power of the new outlook is embodied in the notion of invariance. The abstraction of cardinal number was perhaps the clearest and oldest example of this notion. As Korzybski, Russell, and others have pointed out, a tremendous intellectual revolution sprang from the revelation that a 'brace' of pheasants, a 'pair' of boots, a 'team' of horses, 'twins,' 'couples,' and 'duets' are all in- stances of a particular invariance which we have come to call the cardinal num- ber 'two.' Basically the same kind of revelation underlies the law of gravity. To Newton falling bodies, tides, and the motions of the moon also appeared as instances of an invariance. It is this novel outlook which enabled him to formu- late the famous inverse square law. It is important to note that one cannot point at the 'two-ness' of two cows. Nor can one mine gravity. But it is precisely these 'intangibles' which have proved most useful in the business of scientific map-making. In counting groups of cows and stars we must completely disregard the 'cowness' and the 'starness' of the groups, just as we disregard the 'nature' of the objects subject to gravi- tational forces in computing the effects of such forces. The things that do matter are not the 'nature' of the objects but the relations between them. Here knowl- edge has been reduced to structure and order. Mathematical Biophysics and Non-Aristotelian Methods Mathematical at the discovery biophysics of the significant and cybernetics invariants are programs underlying of the research functioning aimed at the discovery of the significant invariants underlying the functioning of the nervous system. Rashevsky, for example, who may be considered the founder of mathematical biophysics, considers the central nervous system as an 'aggregate of a very large number of irritable elements, which all can be divided T For a fuller discussion of the consequences of anthropomorphism in scientific ques- tions see A. Rapoport, 'Newtonian Physics and Aviation Cadets,' ETC., 1.154 (1944). 149</page><page sequence="6">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS into two groups: exciting and inhibiting' and proposes 'a systematic study of the simplest cases of interaction which may occur in such an aggregate.'8 Thus, the method of mathematical biophysics is geared to the outlook of the general semanticist. As has been pointed out, for the general semanticist the problem of describing the world is a relation-seeking problem. The relations form a structure and the properties of this structure are then the properties of the world. To the general semanticist, knowledge means knowledge of struc- ture. This is the epistemologica! aspect of the problem. But the general seman- ticist recognizes another aspect, namely, the physiological one. And this aspect also revolves about structure, namely, the structure of the nervous system. In fact, the general semanticist views sanity as a measure of the correspondence between the two structures (see Principle 4 above) . It is most important to remember that the word 'structure' as used here refers to a spatio-temporal configuration of events and not merely to the rela- tive position of objects in space or to the connections between the neural ele- ments. If this extension of the meaning of structure from spatial to spatio- temporal is not made, then the objections of the Gestaltists, Freudians, etc. to what they believe to be the behaviorist point of view are certainly justified. The early behaviorist view that behavior can be explained in terms of the spatial relations between the neural components of an organism rested on the tacit assumption that during an appreciable interval of time the nervous system of an organism is in a certain 'state,' which completely determines what stimulus elicits what response. The neurological basis of this assumption, as pointed out by F. S. C. Northrup, was the hypothesis that 'neurons are always put to- gether in the nervous system to form a path in or through the nervous system which is non-circular.'9 This oversimplified notion is untenable in the light of (1) the principle of non-identity, (2) recent neurological findings, and (3) the theoretical in- vestigations of the central nervous system by the mathematical biophysicists. To begin with, the principle of non-identity, one of the corner stones of general semantics, excludes the possibility of two stimuli being 'identical' and the possibility of defining the 'state' of the nervous system over an appreciable interval of time. Secondly, the neurophysiologists (chiefly Lorente de No, Cannon, and Rosenblueth) have called attention to the importance of circular paths (reverberating chains of neurons) in the central nervous system. Finally, Rashevsky has shown by constructing models how circular paths may account for conditioning and gestalt phenomena, while McCulloch, Pitts, Householder, and Landahl have laid the foundations for the mathematical treatment of the spatio-temporal structure of neural nets. 8N.

The work is now rapidly progress- ing. The Boolean algebra methods of McCulloch and Pitts are being extended to a statistical (probabilistic) formulation, which appears as a generalization of behaviorist views. It was the hope of the general semanticists that such a gener- alization would be found and would provide an opportunity for constructing a science of man adequate for our times. It is the task of the mathematical bio- physicists actually to construct such a science. At the time Korzybski presented the above-mentioned paper, he could report no more of this task (the physico-mathematical method applied to a science of man) than the work of Whitehead, Russell, Poincar√©, and Keyser, who had shown the similarity of structure between logic and mathematics. To- day, a quarter of a century later, we can report considerably more. To begin with, the physiological aspect of the problem had been outlined by Korzybski himself in Science and Sanity. And as Science and Sanity was being written, isolated investigators were already at work, laying the foundations of a physico-mathematical theory of the nervous system. We have already men- tioned Rashevsky and his group, now active at the University of Chicago. Work along similar lines has been carried out by Blair (Rochester, N. Y.), Hill (England), Monnier (France), Schaefer (Germany) and others. The very tools of research which these workers employed (the physico-mathematical method) enabled them to emphasize the important aspects of the problem, namely, in- variants rather than agencies. Consciousness of Abstracting To pointed be sure, out that the point the picture of view of the has nervous not been system left unchallenged. as presented, for It has example, been pointed out that the picture of the nervous system as presented, for example, in Rashevsky' s Mathematical Biophysics, is so abstract as to lose contact with 'reality.' It is maintained that neurons are not simply 'elements,' that the pro- cesses underlying their activity are enormously complex, that perhaps they are not even amenable to description in physico-chemical terms, etc. A thorough analysis of these objections is given in the introduction to Rashevsky' s book. One can see from his arguments that he is semantically sophisticated. For the sake of continuity, however, we shall briefly reproduce them here using a term- inology somewhat more current in the literature of general semantics. The objection that a formulation deals with 'abstractions' and not 'realities' is a vacuous one, because there is no such thing as a description of 'concrete reality.' No matter how minutely one were to describe a 'neuron' or the sequence of events associated with the interaction of neurons, one would not be describ- ing 'reality' but only selecting certain aspects of it considered pertinent to the problem at hand, that is, abstracting. The question is, therefore, not whether 151</page><page sequence="8">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS abstractions as such are justifiable (they cannot be escaped), but which abstrac- tions are useful. Useful for what? Useful for discovering relations to be used in constructing theories from which other relations can be predicted. The veri- fication of predictions implied in the theories is, of course, the test of their truth. But even if the predictions fail to be realized, the framework of the theory is often such that the way to refinement and correction becomes evident and thus progress in the search for truth can be realized. Precisely this is the raison d'√™tre of the abstractions made in physics. Every physicist knows that molecules are not perfectly elastic, tiny billiard balls, as they were assumed to be in the first formulations of the kinetic theory of gases. Hence the physicists were not surprised to see that experimental results often deviated significantly from their predictions. But once the 'classical' kinetic theory was developed, ways of introducing corrections suggested themselves and a steady approach to truth became possible. No physicist believes in the existence (except verbally) of 'point masses,' 'rigid bodies,' or 'continuous fluids.' Yet descriptions of events in terms of derived relations between such fictions is what constitutes physi√ßs. The physicist is at ease using abstractions, because he knows that abstraction is not reality, the word is not the thing. Neural Nets The by the value effective of the use abstractions to which made they in can mathematical be put. On biology the basis should of Rashevsky's be judged by the effective use to which they can be put. On the basis of Rashevsky's picture of the nervous system, it has been possible to describe quantitatively such relations as reaction time as a function of stimulus intensity; reaction time as a function of the interval between a preparatory 'warning' and the stimulus ; acuity of discrimination as a function of the magnitude of the stimulus, and many other relations. The approach has also been extremely useful in suggesting 'models' to account for a wide variety of 'psychological' phenomena, such as conditioned reflexes, error elimination (as observed in maze learning), logical 'thinking,' visual perception and esthetics, and some psychotic states. Perhaps the most remarkable results of this method are to be found in the area dealing with the so-called 'gestalt phenomena.' These, as will be recalled, consist in the ability of nervous systems to appreciate a great many different stimuli as instances of 'the same thing,' that is, to recognize invariance. When a square is presented to us in various positions, we still recog- nize it as a square - in other words, we respond to it always in the same way although the retinal elements involved are quite different each time. Again the square may be of any color, or of the same color but of different brightness. It may be drawn in black lines on a white background or in white lines on a black background. It is still recognized as a square.10 Rashevsky then proceeds to describe a model by means of which a 'neural 10 N.

Thus the structure of an ab- stracting system must be considered to have been given.11 Thinking Machines, Nervous Systems, and Negative Entropy IN struction the meantime, of electronic other computers workers, studying and calculating problems machines connected from with the the point con- struction of electronic computers and calculating machines from the point of view of invariances involved in such devices (that is, disregarding the fact that the elements were vacuum tubes, resistors, coils, wheels, etc.) formulated analogous theories. The two programs of research, a mathematical theory of the nervous system on the one hand and the development of electronic computers on the other, proceeded along parallel lines. As can be readily surmised, such remarkable parallelism could not long remain unnoticed. Workers from both fields soon found themselves talking to each other in a language which was a curious mix- ture of psycho-physiology (neurons, synapses, refractory periods, threshold, etc.) and electronics (feedbacks, vacuum tubes, amplifiers, transformers, etc.). The mathematics, however, was devoid of such specialized terminology. Its abstractions (integrals, differentials, matrices, series, etc.) were disdainfully in- different of the uses to which they were put. They reflected the basic invariances common to both sets of phenomena. It is said that Chinese from different provinces, unable to communicate through spoken language, nevertheless can make themselves adequately under- stood through writing. Psycho-physiologists and communication engineers found themselves in a similar situation. Although the 'pronunciations' of their respec- tive symbols were widely different, yet the symbols themselves (that is the mathe- matical expressions) were quite similar. Thus another border area arose, concerned with problems common to com- munication engineering and psycho-physiology. Norbert Wiener has recently dubbed it cybernetics, a term from the Greek word for governor, an allusion to the principle of negative feedback. The wealth of ideas outlined in Cybernetics (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1948) makes it a book of enormous interest to the general semanticist, es- pecially if he is mathematically trained. As an illustration of the close connec- tion between the areas of study pertinent to general semantics and cybernetics, we shall describe one of the topics discussed by Wiener, namely, the relation between 'amount of information' and entropy. The terms order' and 'conditionally of response' occupy, as is well known, a central position in general semantics. The former is one of the basic undefined terms. The latter is a measure of the complexness of adjustments of which an 11 The general -semanticist will immediately recognize in the schematic representation of Rashevsky's model a neural counterpart of the Structural Differential. Subsequently McCulloch and Pitts and later Culbertson constructed other models. 153</page><page sequence="10">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS organism is capable. In thermodynamics there exists a quantitative definition of order, or rather a quantitative definition of chaos, namely, entropy, so that a natural quantitative definition of order suggests itself, namely, the negative of entropy. Although an adequate discussion of the entropy concept is beyond the scope of this article, nevertheless an attempt will be made to illustrate the concept by an elementary example. Arrange a deck of cards according to suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Note that the first twenty-six cards are all red. Now shuffle the deck thoroughly. Examine the first twenty-six cards. Approximately half of them will be red and the other half black. Now no matter how long you keep shuffling, if you examine the first twenty-six cards now and then, the overwhelming chances are that you will find the same situation: approximately half red, half black. It is practically impossible to bring the cards back into their original order by shufiling. We say that the entropy of the deck has increased. This, indeed, is the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which implies that all natural processes tend to proceed in the direction of increased entropy (greater chaos or less order) . Two different gases brought into contact will soon diffuse into each other because of the random motions of the molecules, and the likeli- hood that they will ever be found again unmixed is vanishingly small. Heat flows from bodies of higher temperature to those at lower temperature. It is shown by consideration of the molecular structure of bodies that this also im- plies an increase of chaos. There are instances, however, where opposite processes seem to occur. The most obvious of these are those where some 'intelligence' seems to interfere. For example, we can take a well shuffled deck of cards and shortly bring it back to its factory order.12 Involved in such an ordering is a sequence of decisions (this card is black; this card is red, etc.). Presumably the decisions are events in the nervous system of some organism or in some 'servo-mechanism,' to use the terminology of communications engineers. It has been conjectured that such decisions and life processes in general are somehow connected with regions where a marked lowering of entropy is taking place. Figuratively speaking, life has been compared to a process which attempts to stem the ever-onrushing tide of chaos. To quote Schroedinger : What an organism feeds upon is negative entropy. Or, to put it less paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that the organism 12 This illustration is not meant as an example contradicting the Second Law of Thermodynamics inasmuch as the system considered is not isolated. It is brought out merely to show that the processes where an 'intelligence' interferes may seem to tend toward decreased entropy whereas they tend toward greater entropy when 'left to them- selves.' 154</page><page sequence="11">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND GENERAL SEMANTICS succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing while alive.13 To be sure, a hard-headed, 'realistic scientist may dismiss such speculations as poetic romanticising, irrelevant to scientific procedure. This austere attitude is, no doubt, a reflection of the exacting standards of modern scientific rigor. Yet let us remember that before a child learns to talk, he must babble. Towards More Complex Organization The Weltanschauung, early formulations are naturally of general full of semantics, conjectures. like The those recent of investigations any dynamic Weltanschauung, are naturally full of conjectures. The recent investigations of mathematical biophysics and now of cybernetics give ample testimony to the fertility of at least some of those conjectures. One of them is the notion of an intimate connection between knowledge and ordered structure. Wiener has succeeded in formulating this connection mathe- matically. From a very natural definition of 'amount of information,' Wiener derives a formal mathematical isomorphism between it and the negative of entropy, which, as has been pointed out, can be taken to be the measure of order. This formulation immediately suggests relations between ordered sys- tems and the dynamics of knowing. Indeed, so remarkable is the parallelism between ordered systems of an 'inorganic' nature and what had long been commonly regarded as 'mental phenomena,' that the remarks of Butler's Philo- sopher lose their sardonic character and seem to attain a prophetic significance.14 Finally, the application of statistical methods to two other important classes of biological problems must be mentioned, namely, the evolution and the de- velopmental embryology of nervous systems. If one takes the point of view that the developmental potential of an organism resides in the structure of its neural net, an obvious question to ask is how this neural net comes into being. We have already shown how cybernetics seeks to establish a formal mathe- matical relation between 'amount of information' and 'amount of order.' Trans- lated into psycho-physiological terms, the relation becomes one between 'intelli- gence' and 'degree of organization,' while the analogous notions in general 13 E . Schroedinger, What Is Life?

The authors of the present article have attempted to formulate mathematically the process of embryological development of a neural net by employing statistical and stochastic methods.15 Essentially the problem is this: the models of neural nets which Rashevsky, Landahl, Culbertson, McCulloch, Householder, Pitts, and others constructed to account for various psychological phenomena, contain many frequently recurring 'units of structure,' such as cycles, convergences, divergences, cross-connections, etc. How do such structures arise? What variations can be expected between in- dividuals, species, genera, classes, etc.? What are the invariances associated with the process of their development? In vertebrates, the basic features of the process can be described as follows: Certain regions of the embryonic ectodermal tissue give rise to specialized cells called neuroblasts. In the course of development, each neuroblast grows pro- tuberances (axones and dendrites) which ultimately form connections (synapses) with the dendrites and axones of other neuroblasts. Such a maze of connected neurons (adult neuroblasts) is referred to as a neural net. Certain neurophy- siologists, notably P. A. Weiss, have studied the factors influencing the course of such development. In particular they have sought to determine the forces influencing the direction of growth of the axones and dendrites and the specific affinities determining the patterns which are formed by the connections. In line with this view, the authors have asked the following question. Given an initial distribution of developing neuroblasts, what can be said about the probability of certain patterns arising in the absence of any organising influ- ences? In the process of the mathematical formulation of this problem, certain parameters arise, whose variations are a measure of the 'amounts of order' of the system. Hence the growth-determining factors studied by Weiss may be associated with these parameters and integrated into a mathematical theory of neural organization. Contributions to a Science of Man IT discussed remains here to summarize is making the toward contributions the development which each of a of science the three of man. disciplines discussed here is making toward the development of a science of man. General semantics begins with the definition of man as a time-binding class of life. Then it seeks to establish those characteristics of the human organism on which its time-binding function depends, namely, the ability to symbolize and communicate experience. This ability is shown to be a survival mechanism 15 Cf. various articles on the statistical approach to the theory of the nervous system by A. Rapoport and A. Shimbel in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, Vol. 10, 1948. 156</page><page sequence="13">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND GENERAL SEMANTICS which distinguishes the time-binding species from others. Furthermore, this particular survival mechanism in a sense includes other such mechanisms inas- much as it implies a measure of control over them. Man, for example, by means of his time-binding activities and subsequent accumulation of knowledge, can immunize himself against certain diseases, thereby manufacturing' what is commonly called a survival mechanism. Finally, general semantics seeks to develop techniques of symbol manipulation which would insure the maximum utilization of time-binding and thus arrives at the necessity of formulating non- aristotelian systems. Mathematical biophysics starts with the assumption that so-called 'mental' phenomena can be described in terms of physico-chemical events in mathematical language. Some such descriptions have been successful and have led to infer- ences concerning the structure of the nervous system. The study of interacting nervous systems leads to a natural extension of this discipline to the social sciences.16 Cybernetics seeks invariant relations among servo-mechanisms (e.g. nervous systems and electronic computers) . These invariants provide clues to the condi- tions underlying the knowledge of 'universais.' Again a natural extension to social science suggests itself, namely, the consideration of the role of ideas in cultural patterns and in social organization.17 Social Implications We phenomena see that each from approach the point leads of view naturally of interactions to the consideration of organisms with of social par- phenomena from the point of view of interactions of organisms with par- ticular emphasis on the interaction of their nervous systems. One might say that the long-range program of this approach is the investigation of the way social phenomena depend on the structure of the nervous systems of the interacting organisms. Wiener goes a step further by extrapolating the future development of society not only in terms of the reactions of human nervous systems with each other but also in terms of the relations between human nervous systems and cer- tain devices built by human beings. In fact, these devices can be considered extra-corporeal sensoria (thermometers, galvanometers, radar, geiger counters) and extra-corporeal brains (computers, harmonic analyzers, etc.). It is not at all bizarre to think of such extra-corporeal sensoria and nervous systems as biological adaptations. Indeed, they are not confined to man. Certain species of crustacea have highly innervated pouches into which they insert grains of sand immediately upon birth. The pouches together with the sand then function 19 Cf., for example, N. Rashevsky, Mathematical Theory of Human Relations. 11 As Northrup suggests in the above mentioned article, our problem or determining the relation between cultural factors and biological factors in social science becomes, in part at least, that of determining the relation between the processes of biological systems and the responses of people to particulars which embody universais.' 157</page><page sequence="14">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS as equilibrium-preserving mechanisms. These animals are certainly employing extra-corporeal sensoria. In man this process has been going on for some time, and moreover it is cumulative. Wiener considers the implications of this process exceedingly im- portant. He predicts that the 'thinking machines' will make it unnecessary to employ people for making trivial decisions. Hence if our society continues to look upon human labor as a commodity to be bought and sold, we shall eventu- ally reach a stage where a vast majority of people will have 'nothing to sell.' They will become 'superfluous.' Wiener then is forced to the conclusion that either this superfluous population will have to be done away with or human values will have to be measured in terms other than commercial. The authors feel that Wiener's predictions are as yet premature. There is not sufficient evidence to infer the inevitable devaluation of the mediocre de- cision-maker as such. However, the authors definitely agree with Professor Wiener that the present almost universal evaluation of human beings in terms of the market value of their services (witness the expressions, 'labor market,' 'labor monopoly,' etc., widely used in the commercial press and in orthodox economics) is fundamentally pernicious. When coupled with technological ad- vances, it serves to aggravate the misevaluations and the semantic disturbances which form the core of our social problems. It is a truism that advances in technology are often accompanied by social ills and catastrophes because of the lag that exists between technological inven- tion and social adjustment. It could be easily imagined that the thinking ma- chines may likewise carry with them potentialities of social disintegration. Whether or not this disintegration can be avoided is an interesting question, but it will not be discussed here. Rather we should like to examine some of the more obvious adjustments of human behavior which will have to accompany the de- velopment of thinking machines. Some of these adjustments have already imperceptibly diffused through our culture. Switchboard girls, comptometrists, I.B.M. operators, etc., are all people who have been trained in the use of extra-corporeal 'nervous systems.' Wherein consists their training? It consists in being able to ask very simple but meaningful questions. To be sure, the questions are not asked by the usual form of com- munication. But neither are mathematical equations stated in 'every day lan- guage.' Yet the formulation of a problem as a mathematical equation is essen- tially a formulation of a question in the most meaningful and manipulable form. And so is the operation of a thinking machine. The development of thinking machines implies primarily a growth of the repertoire of questions which may be meaningfully put to them. Hence, the training of people employed in operating these machines is essentially a training in a new kind of communica- tion. This aspect of machine manipulation may seem ludicrous to those who asso- ciate contemporary technology with the frustrations of monotonous 'assembly 158</page><page sequence="15">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND GENERAL SEMANTICS line' labor. The authors venture to suggest that these frustrations are due not so much to the super-organized character of our production as to the disor- ganized character of our competitive society. A mathematician 'discoursing' with a mammoth differential analyzer does not feel frustrated. It takes skill to ask meaningful questions. The history of knowledge is largely a development of the ability to ask such questions and the recognition of their importance. Contrary to this striving for objective cognition run the par- tialities, wishful thinking, social involvements and superstitions which en- cumber our communicative process. The thinking machine (at least at this stage of its development) has no ideology. Moreover its 'sanity' is measurable in terms of its performance. The semantic implications of mathematical biophysics and cybernetics are pointing a way to a measure of our own sanity. How meaningful are the ques- tions we ask ourselves and each other, and to what degree do we let 'static' distort our answers? Perhaps we can eventually manage to keep ourselves at least as sane as our extra-corporeal nervous systems. With that minimum of sanity (i.e., the effective use of our problem-solving potential at all levels of com- plexity) we may begin to hope for a fuller realization of what Korzybski has called the 'manhood of humanity.' The statement that social phenomena (or for that matter, any given phenomena) are not amenable to mathematical treatment is in essence an opinion, based on the fact that hitherto no success- ful application of mathematics to social phenomena has been made. While no one can deny this fact in the past, it is legitimate to challenge such a pessimistic extrapolation into the future. N.
