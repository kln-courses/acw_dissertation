<plain_text><page sequence="1">i83 THREE DRAWINGS OF FELLOWS BY WILLIAM BROCKEDON, F.R.S. By LISE WILKINSON Chemistry Department, Imperial College, London [Plates 17 to I9] N the last issue of Notes and Records, mention was made of William Brockedon's series of drawings of Fellows of the Royal Society. Three of these drawings are now reproduced, by kind permission of the Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery, together with information about the activities of each sitter at the time of the portrait. CHARLES BABBAGE, F.R.S., I792-I87I. Drawing dated 12 March 1840. In 1840 Babbage was invited by Plana to attend the congress at Turin, and to lecture on his Analytical Engine. He went, exhibiting drawings and models of the engine, which became the subject of an essay by L. F. Menabrea (i). Even the King, Charles Albert, showed his interest, and received Babbage with con- siderable respect and graciousness. Babbage never forgot it; he devoted a chapter of his Passagesfrom the Life of a Philosopher (2) to a description of his experiences at the Italian court, and indeed dedicated the volume, published in 1864, to Victor Emmanuel II of Italy with a reference to the King's father who showed the 'first public and official acknowledgement' of the analytical engine. This dedication reflects his bitterness towards his own country's government, who in I842 refused to continue to support the development of Babbage's engines on the grounds of excessive and indefinite expense. Yet as much as jI7000 of public money had already been spent, and no tangible results were in sight. Babbage's genius was too far ahead of his time, and he did have an unfortunate tendency to abandon whatever model he was working on for a new and better one he had just thought of. Although he never gave up working on his designs, the official decision to abandon the project left him a bitter and disappointed man. However, his sense of humour was never quite defeated, and Passagesfrom the Life of a Philosopher reads as a curious mixture of bitterness and humour. Even the title page carries a fictitious 'quotation' from an 'Auto- biography of an Oyster, deciphered by the aid of photography in the shell of a philosopher of that race-recently scolloped'. It leaves one wondering if Charles Lutwidge Dodgson who at the time lectured in mathematics at Oxford,</page><page sequence="2">184 read the Cambridge mathematician's memoirs and perhaps later remembered Babbage's anthropomorphic treatment of oysters when he wrote the Walrus and the Carpenter for Through the Looking Glass. About 1840 Babbage was also very active in the social life of intellectual London. Charles Darwin, in his autobiography (3), remembers a dinner at his brother's, where 'Babbage and Lyell, both of whom liked to talk' were silenced by Carlyle, who held forth endlessly on 'the advantages of silence'. After dinner, Darwin tells us, 'Babbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very interesting lecture on silence'. Brockedon seems to have caught the essence of Babbage at this time in his portrait-the fierce intelligence, the steely regard, and the defiant tilt of the head-the Babbage who still believed in his Analytical Engine, and whose dream had not yet been shattered.

Dalton's visit to London in May 1834 was an entirely happy occasion (I). After tireless efforts by Babbage and others, the King (William IV) had finally granted him a pension the year before. At the same time, the 'Dalton Com- mittee' had raised money in Manchester and elsewhere (including a 'liberal contribution from Dr Faraday'), with a view to obtaining a statue of Dalton. Chantrey was approached and declared himself to be not only willing, but anxious to execute the statue, out of respect for the subject and to 'be remem- bered by posterity in connection with so great a name'. And so Dalton travelled to London, accompanied by his friend and later biographer, W. C. Henry. On 2 May I834 Dalton wrote to Peter Clare in Manchester describing his experiences in Chantrey's studio. The letter includes the following passage (2): 'At last he took a pitcher and blew a little water in my face (I mean the model), and covered my head with a wet cloth and we parted, he having desired me to bring Dr Henry and Dr Philp with me next morning to breakfast. We went accordingly, and found an abundant table; soon after Dr Faraday came in, and we all went into the working room for a time.' The statue was successfully completed, and placed in the entrance hall of the Manchester Royal Institution. While the sittings were in progress, Babbage somehow persuaded Dalton to be presented at Court. Babbage himself has provided us with an amusing account of this episode, both in his own Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, and in a</page><page sequence="3">Plate I7 CHARLES BABBAGE, F.R.S.

He first discussed the issue with a mutual friend, Mr Wood, who remarked that 'Dr Dalton, as a Quaker, could not go in a court dress, because he must wear a sword. To this I replied, that being aware of this, I had proposed to let him wear the robes of a Doctor of Laws at Oxford. Mr Wood remarked that those robes being scarlet, they were not of a colour admissible by Quakers. To this I replied, that Dr Dalton had a kind of colour blindness, and that all red colours appeared to him to be the colour of dirt.' (4). The difficulty being thus elegantly overcome, Dalton came to Babbage for further discussion; they rather lost themselves in admiration of the Difference Engine, and ensuing calculations, but in the end settled the matter. When they arrived in the ante-chamber, they found themselves in the company of two bishops; and according to Babbage the effect of the sight of a Quaker in scarlet doctor's robes was 'electric upon the whole party; episcopal eyes had never yet beheld such a spectacle in such society, and I fear, not- withstanding my assurance, some portion of the establishment thought the Church really in danger'. But in the presence chamber all was well. The King asked Dalton several questions, and seemed genuinely interested in his views. In the autumn of the same year, when the British Association met in Edinburgh, the University conferred on Dalton the degree of LL.D. Dr Traill wrote to him: 'We were quite aware that Oxford had done itself the honour by conferring a similar degree on you (5); but we were also anxious to testify our respect and admiration for the scientific attainments of the author of the atomic theory. As such please to accept it.' NOTES (i) W. C. Henry: Memoirs of the Life and Scientific Researches of John Dalton, London, 1854, Chapter VII. (2) Ibid., p. 184. (3) Ibid., p. I85.

As usual, his work at the Royal Institution had led to a number of papers on varied subjects. 'On a peculiar class of optical deceptions' (i) was an off-shoot of the work, done originally in collaboration with Herschel and others, to develop highly</page><page sequence="6">i86 refractive glass hard enough for optical purposes. In the end it was of no particular practical use; but many years later Faraday used the heavy glass to demonstrate the rotation of polarized light, and subsequently diamagnetic repulsion. In the Philosophical Transactions he published a paper on vibrating surfaces (2), and in theJournal ofthe Royal Institution 'On the Limits of Vaporisa- tion' (3). After Easter he gave four afternoon lectures at the Royal Institution on optical deceptions, lithography, flowing sand, and caoutchouc; and during the season he took five Friday evenings for his discourses. But 1831 is above all the year which marked the beginning of Faraday's 'Electrical Researches'; on 29 August he describes in his diary (4) the Induction Ring Experiment, under the heading 'Experiments on the production of electricity from magnetism'. The experiments continued throughout September and October. On 23 September he writes (5) to a friend 'I am busy just now again on electromagnetism, and think I have got hold of a good thing, but can't say. It may be a weed instead of a fish that, after all my labour, I may at last pull up'. By November it was obvious that it was a fish and no weed. He was sure of his ground and ready to sum up his results in the first series of'Experimental Researches in Electricity'. It was read on 24 November at the Royal Society (6), and consisted of four parts. I On the Induction of Electric Currents. II On the Evolution of Electricity from Magnetism. III On a new Electrical Condition of Matter. IV On Arago's Magnetic Phenomena. Part IV required tactful handling since, as Faraday explained in a letter (7) to a friend, 'great names are concerned (Arago, Babbage, Herschel, etc.)', and he 'had to differ from them'. More experiments followed during December and January, and on 12 January I832 he read the Bakerian lecture (8) at the Royal Society on 'terrestrial magneto-electric induction, and on the force and direction of magneto-electric induction generally'. It was a turning-point and the beginning of a brilliant series of studies in electricity which were to continue for nearly thirty years. Tyndall in his biography (9) sees Faraday in 1831 'on the threshold of a career of discovery unparalleled in the history of pure experimental science'. It is difficult to imagine how there could be time for a portrait-drawing session during this period of unrelenting activity. It would have been tempting to assume that Brockedon, who had a particular interest in caoutchouc, attended Faraday's Royal Institution lecture on that subject, and brought along</page><page sequence="7">Plate I9 MICHAEL FARADAY, F.R.S. (I79I-1867) Facing page 186</page><page sequence="8">187 his sketchbook. But the drawing is dated quite clearly 26 December. This was a day of singularly hectic activity in Faraday's laboratory; the notes (Io) cover more than six pages of the diary, and at one point Faraday is moved to pro- nounce the results beautiful. But as usual the diary remains strictly a collection of experimental data and explanations, with no reference to portrait-drawing, or any other private matters.
