<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS LEWIS S. FORD* W HILE the basic structure for the Systematic Theology remained quite stable during the four decades Tillich devoted to its completion, two crucial issues were shaped and reshaped several times. Both of these may be called "metatheological" issues, for they do not represent points of doc- trine or interpretation within the systematic framework as much as theories about what he was trying to do in the Systematic Theology. One of these issues concerns the proper relationship between philosophy and theology, with which Tillich wrestled throughout his entire career. We find that he has usually been much more certain about the particular interaction between philosophy and theology in specific instances than he has been about the proper theory to de- scribe this general correlation. In this essay we shall concentrate on the second "metatheological" issue to which Tillich has devoted considerable attention, the problem of the proper mode of discourse to use in describing God or being-itself. Because of the intrinsic importance of any theory of religious symbols, and be- cause of its peculiar importance within Tillich's own systematic thought, we have sought to describe and briefly criticize his attempts to formulate such a theory. Tillich insists that ordinary, literal, non-symbolic language is inappropriate when speaking of God. It is incorrect, no matter what meaning of "ordinary" we choose to employ. 1. The "ordinary" may mean that sphere of activity or life which is un- affected by our ultimate concern. Since ultimate concern ought to permeate all we do, we cannot completely isolate any purely secular domain. But we can say that the "ordinary" refers to reality insofar as it is theoretically apprehended, in abstraction from all existential concerns, including those that are ultimate. Words cannot be used in their ordinary senses to apply to God, if God stands for that which ultimately concerns us. If ordinary words could be used, then it would be possible to have theoretical knowledge of that which is symbol- ized. Religious symbols could then be transferred from the context of ultimate concern to one in which this concern is deliberately ignored for the sake of scientific or philosophical objectivity. This contradicts the basic assertion that Tillich wishes to make about God, namely, that we cannot apprehend him without being personally involved and without committing ourselves to him with supreme dedication. This is the reason for the "theological circle" (ST, I * Professor Ford is professor of philosophy and religion at Raymond College, University of the Pacific, Stockton, Calif.

In ultimate concern we communicate to others by means of mere out- lines or ciphers which barely sketch the contours of that which grasps us. These outlines or ciphers are nearly meaningless unless they are also received in the state of ultimate concern. The reality symbolized cannot be grasped outside the community of faith. 2. The "ordinary" may refer to all that has being or that is included within some being. Ordinary philosophical concepts describe the nature of beings: their subsistence, potentialities, relations, properties. Their univocal use entails that the referent of these concepts be itself a being. Since being-itself cannot be a being for Tillich, all philosophical concepts must be symbolically transformed in order to apply to that which is beyond the realm of beings. Philosophical con- cepts are derived from "ordinary" contexts in the sense that they are obtained from the analysis of the general properties of individual beings.2 Within this context they may be used literally and directly, but they cannot properly be applied beyond its limits. Used univocally, they would treat being-itself as a being among others. In this sense, the ordinary may refer to that which is within the scope of human understanding. Tillich maintains that "Man is bound to the categories of finitude" (ST, I, 237). Man's grasp of reality is infected by this finitude, and he is unable to fashion the conceptual tools required to analyze that which is be- yond finitude. Man's categories are necessarily categories of finitude, and God cannot be subject to these categories. For Tillich we can describe God in terms of such categories only if these categories are symbolically transformed. If these reasons deny us the use of ordinary concepts in their fullest and most literal sense when speaking of God, other reasons preclude the use of concepts in meanings totally divorced from their literal sense. No gain in knowledge or communication can be achieved through the use of equivocal terms. If we like, we could stipulate that being-itself is a person, carefully specifying that we are using the word "person" in an entirely different sense from any of the meanings we ordinarily attach to the word. This need not mean that being-itself is a per- son in any really significant sense. For we could just as easily say that being- itself is "multicellular" or "liquid," if these words are used in entirely different senses from their ordinary meanings.3 If "person" sounds more plausible than "multicellular" or "liquid," it is only because the meaning of "person," in its literal sense, may not be entirely different from the meaning of being-itself. If this is true, "person" is not being used for being-itself in an entirely equivocal sense. Strict equivocation renders any reference to a term's ordinary or literal meaning useless, since in its equivocal meaning the term must mean something entirely different. If strict univocity and complete equivocity were our only alternatives, we would be in a most difficult position with respect to any discourse about God. You are in fact in an insoluble dilemma. If you assert existence and causality of God in the same sense in which you assert them of finite beings, you are rendering God incapable of fulfilling the very function for whose performance you alleged him to be necessary. But if you assert existence and causality of God in an altogether different</page><page sequence="3">106 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION sense from that in which you assert them of finite beings, you are making statements about God to which you can, ex hypothesi, assign no intelligible content. God therefore is either useless or unthinkable; this would seem to be the conclusion of the matter.4 The way of analogy and symbolism is the search for an intermediate position that avoids the pitfalls of either extreme. Concepts used of God must be both partly similar to and partly different from their meanings as used in ordinary discourse. Just how the intermediate position may be achieved constitutes the problem of constructing an adequate theory for non-univocal predication, whether it be by analogy or by religious symbols. Though Tillich recognizes the necessity for a theory of symbols and has sought diligently to formulate one, it takes a subordinate position within the total systematic framework of his thought. From the systematic standpoint, the exact nature of the religious symbol is less important than the various functions it must perform. Thus Tillich has permitted himself considerable liberty in developing alternative and competing theories concerning the nature of the symbol. We discern at least three: a dialectic of affirmation and negation, an extended use of the metaphor of the transparency of the symbolic medium, and a theory of participation relevant to symbolic predication. These theories appear singly and in various combinations with one another. Tillich's sole requirement for these theories is that they adequately describe symbols capable of fulfilling the necessary metaphysical and religious functions required of them. Following Tillich's usage, we shall define "religious symbol" in a very broad sense. A religious symbol is an entity (whether it be a metaphysical concept, a liturgical phrase, a sacramental object, or whatever) which designates God and/ or being-itself. Since "God is being-itself" (ST, I, 238), it frequently makes little difference whether the symbol designates God or being-itself. But we must bear in mind that this affirmation is a synthetic one, and the meanings Tillich gives to "God" and to "being-itself" are logically distinct. The first properly belongs to religious contexts, for "God" is that which ultimately concerns us. "Being-itself" may be used in both religious and metaphysical contexts to desig- nate that which is not itself a being but rather the source of being for all beings. I. THE DIALECTIC OF AFFIRMATION AND NEGATION "Every religious symbol negates itself in its literal meaning, but it affirms itself in its self-transcending meaning" (ST, I, 9). This sentence expresses the kernel of Tillich's primary contention concerning the religious symbol. Sym- bolic transformation is achieved by the double movement, the first to avoid univocity, the second to avoid equivocity. The functions of the symbol require that the direct literal meaning be partially negated but that enough meaning be retained in order to point beyond the symbol itself to that which is ultimate. The segment of finite reality which becomes the vehicle of a concrete assertion about God is affirmed and negated at the same time. It becomes a symbol, for a symbolic expression is one whose proper meaning is negated by that to which it points. And yet it also is affirmed by it, and this affirmation gives the symbolic expression an adequate basis for pointing beyond itself [ST, I, 239].</page><page sequence="4">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 107 These two features of the symbol, the affirmation and the negation, must be structurally interdependent. The significance of the one must be bound up with the other. Otherwise it would be possible for us to analyze the symbolic expres- sion into its two components, one purely affirmative expression and one purely negative expression. The purely affirmative statement would say what it means directly and properly, thereby giving us a univocal assertion concerning the ultimate. But this would be contrary to Tillich's entire systematic framework, which permits only one univocal or non-symbolic assertion about the ultimate, namely, that God is being-itself. The functions of religious symbols require such a unity that the component elements cannot be separately analyzed. In describing the double movement of affirmation and negation, Tillich fre- quently uses the temporal metaphor of simultaneity. Being-itself is symbolically described as the " 'eternal now' in which the temporal and the spatial are simul- taneously accepted and overcome," and as the " 'ground of being' in which the causal and the substantial are simultaneously confirmed and negated" (ST, I, 209). This same metaphor also appears in Tillich's distinction between the literal and the symbolic application of the categories: "On the creaturely level, ontological elements and categories are applicable in a proper and literal sense. On the level of God's relation to the creature, the categories are affirmed and negated at the same time" (ST, I, 286). Here it is assumed that if the affirma- tion could be made separately, at a different time, the categories would be applicable to God "in a proper and literal sense." If it were possible to isolate the affirmative element present in some category as it applies to God, then the category would no longer be used as a symbol. The double movement cannot be reduced without eliminating the symbol by substituting some highly qualified and restricted concept for it. The structural similarities between religious symbols and Tillich's ontological polarities are quite striking. Each ontological element requires its polar oppo- site to express the nature of reality completely, as well as its own meaning. Par- ticipation can be meaningful only if there are individuals who participate (ST, I, 174-78). Dynamics without form is sheer chaos, not creativity (ST, I, 178- 82). Freedom that fails to affect one's destiny is ineffectual (ST, I, 182-86). We may treat the two aspects of the religious symbol as polar opposites, each re- quiring the other both for the total meaning of the symbol and for the meaning of each component. It is impossible to isolate the affirmative components within the symbol because the meaning of this component is partially dependent upon the negative and finite features of the symbol. For example, Tillich argues that we cannot speak of God as personal if this means that he is a person. Now it is impossible to attach any clear meaning to "personal," whether we are thinking of a personal being or of a personal rela- tionship or encounter, if we eliminate every association pertaining to man's per- sonal self-awareness or to his encounters with other persons. Yet this abstrac- tion would have to be made in order to isolate the purely affirmative aspect of the "personal" as it applies to God. Used symbolically of God, the affirmative meaning of the "personal" depends in part upon finite properties which are necessarily involved in our own appreciation of personality.</page><page sequence="5">108 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION In effect, then, Tillich has applied the theory of polarity, developed primarily for an understanding of the ontological elements, to the religious symbol. This theory of polarity, we believe, is basically derived from F. W. J. Schelling's dia- lectical theory of potencies.5 Schelling never extended this theory to provide for an analysis of religious symbols. In the Philosophie der Mythologie6 Schelling sought to ascertain the element of truth contained in mythological and polythe- istic representations of the divine, but he did not develop a theory showing how these concrete images negated their own finite and contingent features in point- ing beyond themselves to that which is really ultimate. He contented himself with a dialectical demonstration of the necessity of mythology as one stage in the growth of religious imagination. The possibility of a symbolic interpretation of his basic categories apparently never occurred to him. In the analysis of the ontological elements, Tillich asserts that polar opposi- tion occurs between the elements. As they become symbols for the divine life, the polarity enters into these elements, for the properties of each ontological element are simultaneously affirmed and denied in relation to God. This inter- nalization or intensification of the polarity is original with Tillich. We believe it is his most basic modification of Schelling's thought, even though it may seem to be simply an extension of Schelling's theory of polar interaction. By using a symbolic approach based upon simultaneous affirmation and negation, Tillich was able to transform the structure of Schelling's concept of God on almost every point. The core of Schelling's thought is present in Tillich's discussion on the ontological elements within the divine life (ST, I, 241-52). Through sym- bolic transformation, however, Schelling's voice is strangely muted. The turbu- lent theogonic struggle is absent. Schelling's heterodox notions of process and change within God have become reconciled with the traditional insistence upon divine stability and immutability. Where Tillich speaks of temporality, process, diversity, and polar opposition as symbolically included within the eternal unity of God, Schelling meant these as literal elements of the divine life which could not be negated by any demands for divine absoluteness. By applying his theory of religious symbols Tillich was able to transform Schelling's exciting, though quite erratic, concept of a God of becoming into the more orthodox notion of a God of being. We may observe the incipient development of Tillich's affirmation-and-nega- tion theory in an early essay on "The Rejection of the Concept of Religion in the Philosophy of Religion."7 Here he shows a lively awareness for the utterly transcendent character of the Unconditioned [das Unbedingte18 and for the paradoxical nature of every statement concerning the Unconditioned. Every statement about the Unconditioned necessarily treats it as an object. This is the fundamental paradox [Urparadoxie], "since by its very nature the Uncondi- tioned stands beyond the opposition between subject and object."9 If the Un- conditioned can only be known or expressed by means of objectification, then every statement about the Unconditioned in philosophical theology must take a form basically incompatible with its content. The paradox is the only means that philosophical theology can use, for in the paradox the content may be affirmed while the form is denied.</page><page sequence="6">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 109 We may grasp the thrust of Tillich's argument in this excerpt: The decisive objection we raised against past philosophical theology is that it bases the Unconditioned upon the conditioned, either by placing it alongside of the condi- tioned or, since this is intolerable, by reducing its nature to that which is conditioned. Any philosophical theology seeking to do justice to the nature of the Unconditioned must recognize it within every conditioned being as that which grounds and supports both the conditioned being as well as itself. The conditioned is the medium in and through which the Unconditioned is grasped. . ... It therefore follows that the mean- ing of every statement about the Unconditioned must differ in principle from the meaning of every statement about the conditioned. Since every statement as such must be expressed in the pattern of subject and object and is therefore subject to this condi- tioned form, statements concerning the Unconditioned must indeed use this form, though in such a manner that their inadequacy becomes obvious: they must bear the form of systematic paradox.10 Here Tillich introduces the concept of paradox as a solution to this problem of religious expression. The problem of the Unconditioned within our finite ex- perience is prior to any particular analysis of paradox, such as Tillich's own solution in this essay. At this point he is concerned with statements that have a paradoxical form, and he has not yet investigated the nature of concepts as they apply to God. It is not clear, however, to what extent Tillich pushes the para- doxical character of these statements beyond the fact that they include both an affirmation and a denial. Since these may refer to different aspects of the same statement, the contra- diction involved may be only apparent. On the other hand, paradox may mean more than "apparent contradiction," since Tillich also insists upon the joint presence of both the affirmation and the denial. "The structure [of religious statements] is the paradox, that is, it is at once the affirmation and denial of the autonomous form. Religious thought and intuition are therefore such that they use and at the same time break the autonomous forms of thought and intuition.""' The Unconditioned must "break through" into our experience, and its power can only be expressed by those realities whose own power has been "broken," in that they have been recognized to be inadequate substitutes for the ultimate. It is only in this "broken" experience that the paradox is truly grasped as para- dox; otherwise it is liable to degenerate into an objective contradiction.'2 This suggests that the opposing elements within the paradoxical statement are so closely and yet so precariously intertwined that its truth can only be grasped in faith. Paradox, then, is neither contradictory nor non-contradictory but lies somewhere between, its true nature visible solely to the eye of faith. The Systematic Theology reaffirms this interpretation of paradox with re- spect to Christ's Incarnation. In this event the existential conflict between the absolute and the relative is overcome. Every attempt to treat some concrete thing as absolute, whether it be vocation, nation, church, or even humanity, fails because it is by nature finite and relative. On the other hand, every attempt to realize the absolute in that which is abstract produces only formal principles, devoid of content. It is the claim of the Christian faith that "in the</page><page sequence="7">110 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION New Being which is manifest in Jesus as the Christ, the most concrete of all possible forms of concreteness, a personal life, is the bearer of that which is absolute without condition and restriction" (ST, I, 150). Thus the Christian faith is based on the paradox, which is the Incarnation of the divine in human life. The logical form in which the perfectly concrete and the perfectly absolute are united is the paradox. . ... The paradox is the reality to which the contradicting form points; it is the surprising, miraculous, and ecstatic way in which that which is the mystery of being universally is manifest in time, space, and under the conditions of existence, in complete historical concreteness. Final revelation is not logical nonsense; it is a con- crete event which on the level of rationality must be expressed in contradictory terms [ST, I, 150-51]. Although Tillich does not relate this analysis of paradox to his dialectical theory of symbols, we may easily read these statements as a description of the symbol. The affirmative and negative elements of the religious symbol can- not be fully distinguished from one another even in principle, for then we could reduce every symbol or statement to a disjunction of two or more non-symbolic statements offering direct theoretical knowledge of God. But if that which is affirmed is also denied, a logical contradiction arises on the ordinary level of finite analysis. This level, however, is transcended and overcome by the sym- bol's reference beyond the level of finitude, a level we cannot attain directly. The conflicting elements in our finite modes of thought and speech point be- yond themselves to that in which their conflict is resolved. In the Systematic Theology, however, Tillich restricts the use of paradox severely, applying it only to expressions concerning the New Being manifest in the Incarnation. "The appearance of the New Being under the conditions of existence, yet judging and conquering them, is the paradox of the Christian message. This is the only paradox and the source of all paradoxical statements in Christianity" (ST, II, 92). Paradox is employed only for this special event of the coincidence of God and man; no longer it is used to describe the nature of God apart from Christological considerations. Since the time of his earlier essay demanding systematic paradox for every human assertion concerning the Unconditioned, Tillich's concept of the role of paradox in philosophical theol- ogy has been considerably narrowed. In 1922 Tillich had not yet clarified his relationship with the "dialectical theology" of Karl Barth and Emil Brunner. All three thinkers had been strong- ly influenced by Kierkegaard's lively awareness of Christian paradox. The paradox of the Christian faith unmasked the pretentions of human reason to comprehend God on its own terms. Reason cannot grasp God; God must "break through" and reveal Himself to man. Tillich follows Barth and Brunner in making these assertions but goes no further. He agrees with Barth that revelation comes to man from beyond man's finite intellectual and moral ca- pacities, but insists against Barth that man must have the potentiality for receiving this revelation (see BR, 1-5; ST, I, 3-8). He criticizes Brunner's endeavor to heap up paradoxes in an effort to exalt the mystery of God (ST,</page><page sequence="8">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 111 II, 92). As Tillich's own thought demonstrates, rational analysis may also preserve the divine mystery. What he primarily opposes is any insistence upon self-contradictory statements as the expression of a divine truth discontinuous with our human modes of thought (ST, I, 151, n. 8; ST, II, 91). In view of the increased use of paradox in Protestant theology in recent decades, with its resulting semantic confusion, Tillich has tended to restrict the scope of paradox, insisting upon a narrow construction of its etymological meaning: "against opinion." That is paradoxical which contradicts the doxa, the opinion which is based on the whole of ordinary human experience, including the empirical and the rational. The Christian paradox (the Incarnation with its resultant justification of the sinner) con- tradicts the opinion derived from man's existential predicament and all expectations imaginable on the basis of this predicament ... This is neither irrational nor absurd, and it is neither reflectively nor dialectically rational; but it is paradoxical, that is, against man's self-understanding and expectations. The paradox is a new reality and not a logical riddle [ST, II, 92]. Since 1922 Tillich has distinguished the symbolic from the paradoxical, and symbols have taken over most of the functions previously assigned to the paradox. In "Die Uberwindung des Religionsbegriffs" he was primarily con- cerned with the inadequacy of our linguistic and thought patterns to express that which is Unconditioned; but this emphasis must be balanced by a recog- nition of some intrinsic similarity or affinity between that which expresses the Unconditioned and the Unconditioned itself. In the paradox both conflicting elements are transcended by that to which the paradox points, while in the symbol the affirmative element expresses the symbol's referent. The conflicting elements within the symbol are asymmetrical because the affirmative element must constitute the intrinsic similarity between symbol and referent. For this reason the symbol, unlike the paradox, is less likely to degenerate into a logical contradiction outside of the context of faith. Its danger is rather the opposite: that the opposing elements will remove themselves from polar tension, permit- ting the affirmation and the denial to apply to different aspects of the symbol. One further relationship between the symbol and the paradox should be noted. The Christological paradox upon which Tillich concentrates expresses the union of the absolute with that which is most concrete within existential experience, a personal life. Christology is concerned with this union as a par- ticular historical event, but it has wider ramifications. God himself, as the object of ultimate concern, must also be both wholly concrete and wholly absolute. The more concrete a thing is, the more the possible concern about it. The completely concrete being, the individual person, is the object of the most radical concern-the concern of love. On the other hand, ultimate concern must transcend every prelimi- nary finite and concrete concern .... But in transcending the finite the religious con- cern loses the concreteness of a being-to-being relationship. It tends to become not only absolute but also abstract, provoking reactions from the concrete element. This is the inescapable inner tension in the idea of God. The conflict between the concreteness and</page><page sequence="9">112 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the ultimacy of the religious concern is actual wherever God is experienced and this experience is expressed .... It is the key to understanding the dynamics of the history of religion, and it is the basic problem of every doctrine of God [ST, I, 211]. This passage indicates why the logic of Tillich's position leads him to reject natural theology. Philosophical analysis may attain to that which is absolute, that is, it may point to the being-itself which is beyond and behind all particular beings. But its knowledge of this absolute is highly abstract. All that may be known about being-itself philosophically, according to Tillich's position, is that it is not a being, that it is not finite, and that it is simple. In this abstract sense being-itself cannot be identified with God, for God as the object of ultimate concern must be fully concrete. Natural theology is incapable of comprehend- ing the concreteness of God, and therefore fails to appreciate the peculiar na- ture of God as the union of the absolute and the concrete.13 Tillich's solution to the conceptual problem posed by this tension within the idea of God may be found in his theory of the symbol. The concrete personal God whom we worship and to whom we pray is himself a symbol. Taken literally, this personal God is simply a person, a being among others, stripped of the transcendent absoluteness of being-itself (see ST, I, 245; BR, 83 f.). The phrase "personal God" must be understood symbolically so that it may point unambiguously to being-itself; its concrete element therefore must be both affirmed (as the personal quality of our ultimate concern) and denied (insofar as it is finite). The success of this approach turns upon the question whether that which is personal has any meaning apart from particular individual being, as Tillich recognizes (ST, I, 244). In summary we may say that Tillich's theory of the religious symbol as a dialectic of affirmation and negation is an extension of the concept of polarity to meet the needs of non-univocal predication of God. Originally Tillich labeled this inner polarity of affirmation and negation as paradox but then elected to substitute the symbol for the paradox, restricting the meaning of paradox to "that which is contrary to expectation" and reserving it for the event of the Christ. This dialectic of simultaneous affirmation and negation then became the primary means in Tillich's thought for transforming philosophical concepts into symbols appropriate for theology. On the whole it has been tacitly assumed that this particular theory of the symbol applies only to concepts used as symbols. There is, however, at least one instance in which this dialectic has been applied to a material reality used as a symbol: "The religious symbol uses materials of ordinary experience. But it never takes the materials in its literal meaning. It says Yes and No to the material it uses. It says Yes to it as a necessary and adequate material. It says No to it if it claims to be more than material.""4 In this context, Tillich uses "material" in a very broad sense. Concepts, physical actualities, emotional experiences, etc., may become subject to the dialectic of "Yes" and "No." Tillich's terminology is quite fluid on this point, for what is called "material" here was "autonomous form" in the essay of 1922. The form or material is accepted as the necessary vehicle of expression, but it is rejected insofar as it becomes identical with that which it symbolizes.</page><page sequence="10">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 113 In general, if physical actualities are used as symbols, Tillich substitutes the metaphor of a transparent medium, which we shall examine in the next section. The dialectic of affirmation and negation may characterize physical actualities as symbols, but only as a secondary means for describing the transparency of the symbolic medium. To the extent that the ultimate "shines through" the medium, the symbolic power of the medium is affirmed; to the extent the medium is substituted for the ultimate, it is negated as a symbol. II. THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE SYMBOLIC MEDIUM In an early essay on "The Religious Symbol," Tillich distinguishes between three different types of objective religious symbols.'5 The first type consists of the symbol "God" or "Supreme Being." This symbol connotes the uncondi- tioned transcendent, though it must be freed from those figurative elements signifying that which is simply an object. The second type comprises those symbols that characterize the nature and actions of God. Though only briefly sketched in this essay, this type would include the symbolic application of the categories and of the ontological elements to being-itself, as well as the use of such special symbols as God's "love" and his "wrath." For both of these types, the conceptual element predominates. For the first type, the symbol is derived from a conceptual analysis of the idea of a highest member of the hierarchy of beings, for the second type, from an analysis of the ontological properties of all beings (e.g., the categories of causality and substance) or of particular properties of men, such as wrath. For the third type, however, the physical or historical element in the reality symbolized predominates over the conceptual. "The third group of objective symbols are the natural and historical objects that are drawn as holy objects into the sphere of religious objects and thus become religious symbols. In the foreground stand the historical personalities that have become the object of a religious act."'" This third type refers primarily to the Christ as the bearer of the final revelation, but it also includes every physical or historical reality which reveals the presence of the divine. We have mentioned the Incarnation of the Christ in conjunction with Til- lich's understanding of paradox, but we must also consider it in the light of the subsequent Crucifixion, which is the supreme symbol of the Christian faith from his point of view. He interprets the Incarnation as the perfect actualiza- tion of man's essential nature. All other men have deviated from this ideal and have lived in partial existential distortion from this essence. Men have failed to realize their authentic being, although this has always remained a possibility, finally actualized in the unique instance of Jesus as the Christ. In this sense Christ is "very man." But "very man" is also "very God," because as the actualization of essential manhood, the Christ is in essential unity with his ground of being. He is not estranged from being-itself, and is therefore able to manifest the divine being in his being. The death of the Christ proclaims man's essential finitude. Even the perfect life, in which man's authentic being is realized without distortion, has an end.'7 But it also means the complete sacrifice of Jesus to the Christ; all the finite</page><page sequence="11">114 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION contingent elements of the man Jesus of Nazareth must be sacrified so that he might become the pure bearer of that which is divine. "The absolute side of the final revelation, that in it which is unconditional and unchangeable, in- volves the complete transparency and the complete self-sacrifice of the medium in which it appears" (ST, I, 151). This image of transparency, here expressed in the symbol of the Christ, is basic for Tillich's explanation of the symbolic nature of historical and physical actualities. It is implicit in the metaphor contained in the etymology of the word "revelation." Revelation removes the veil from that which is hidden in ordinary experience (ST, I, 108). Ordinary experience contains elements of existential distortion, because man and his world are estranged from God. Only in essential being, freed from this distortion, may being-itself become manifest. As the depth of reason, for example, being-itself "is essentially manifest in reason. But it is hidden in reason under the conditions of existence. ... Essen- tially reason is transparent toward its depth in each of its acts and processes. In existence this transparency is opaque and is replaced by myth and cult" (ST, I, 80). On the one hand, transparency connotes freedom from existential distortion, on the other, negation of the medium as final in itself. The value of the medium lies in its capacity to permit that which is beyond to manifest itself, and this is only possible to the extent that the medium is forgotten or is treated as if it were not there. For example, "holiness cannot become actual except through holy 'objects.' But holy objects are not holy in and of themselves. They are holy only by negating themselves in pointing to the divine of which they are the mediums" (ST, I, 216). A third feature of the medium is its adequacy or its intrinsic affinity with that which it reveals. This is not fully developed in terms of the image of the transparent symbol; we shall find it more pronounced in the theory of symbolic participation. The intrinsic affinity of many natural objects for that which they symbolize cannot be ignored. The baptismal water naturally symbolizes the purifying and cleansing action of Christ's atonement for man's sins. Though every being may potentially be a symbol of the divine, the Christ is a more adequate symbol than a stone. For there is an intrinsic affinity between the centered unity of the Christ and the unity of being-itself in which all ontological tension and separation are eternally overcome. We may question whether these three features of the transparent medium- freedom from existential distortion, negation of finitude, and intrinsic affinity with that which is symbolized-are fully consistent with one another. Freedom from distortion and intrinsic affinity, for example, both emphasize the essential elements of the medium, while the negation of finitude places these essential elements in jeopardy as well. If we remove the opaqueness caused by existential distortion, would this be sufficient to insure the perfect transparency of the medium? At times, Tillich seems to think so; at other times, the further step of negating the finitude of the medium is also required. If the medium achieves transparency through the removal of existential distortion, it would seem un- necessary to guard against any imputation of absoluteness to the medium.</page><page sequence="12">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 115 For that which is perfectly transparent cannot be detected, and our attention would be solely directed to that which is made manifest. Tillich's metaphor of the transparent medium seems to be based on some- thing like a pane of glass rather than upon such things as the atmosphere or the vitreous humor in the eye, which in ordinary vision are totally undetected. A pane of glass is not completely transparent, and its refractive glare calls attention to itself as a medium. Such a medium, insofar as it interferes with or distorts that which it reveals or tends to permit the identification of itself with that which it reveals, must be negated. No negation, however, would be necessary for the perfectly transparent medium. Tillich might argue that every symbol of the divine calls attention to itself and runs the risk of idolatry. Then the identification of the medium with that which is ultimate is an ever present danger. If true, this poses several difficul- ties. It means that some element of opaqueness is present in every medium, including the Christ. The opaqueness cannot be caused solely by existential distortion, unless we are willing to grant that even in the case of the Christ there has been a "fall" from essence. What, then, is this residual opaqueness which cannot be attributed to existential distortion? Is it the essential finitude of the symbolic medium? If so, this finitude must be removed to permit the unconditioned to "shine through." This removal is only necessary if the medium somehow embodies that which is manifest, but this is not the case for a trans- parent medium. What it reveals is not embedded in the medium itself, but lies behind or beyond it. That which is apprehended manifests itself through the transparent medium; the medium is the vehicle, in no sense the source of the manifestation. There may be some confusion here between the metaphor of the transparent medium and the dialectic of affirmation and negation. By this dialectic, the finite elements of the symbol must be removed by negation so that the symbol's expression of the unconditioned may be purely affirmed. Roughly speaking, such a symbol is a compound of finite and infinite elements, inextricably woven together. In its symbolic use, the finite elements are negated at the same time the infinite elements are affirmed. The transparent medium, however, cannot be conceived in this fashion. Rather we must think of something purely finite and non-divine through which the divine manifests itself from beyond. If the finitude of the medium should be removed, nothing would remain. It has no infinite characteristics that would enable it to point beyond itself. What func- tion then does the medium perform, if the divine revelation would appear even more completely in its total absence? It seems its function becomes purely negative. Perhaps its purpose is to puncture holes in the shroud of ordinary experience, letting the divine light through. If the medium is purely transparent, how can we speak of its intrinsic affinity with that which it reveals? Transparency entails the negation of all visible properties. Retaining this visual metaphor, we must say that any affinity be- tween the medium and that which it reveals will consist in visible similarities; but the medium, being transparent, has none. There can be no intrinsic affinity between a perfectly transparent medium and the Unconditioned, unless it be</page><page sequence="13">116 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the transparency of the unconditioned itself. Translated in cognitive terms, this would mean that the unconditioned was itself unknowable. Such a result would defeat the purpose of the symbolic approach insofar as it attempts to go be- yond the results of the via negativa. Taken singly, each of these features has validity for symbolic theory. The negation of finite elements is appropriate to the theory of dialectical affirmation and negation as a means of safeguarding against idolatry. "Existential distor- tion" is a necessary concept for describing how actual existence falls short of its inherent ideal. The intrinsic similarity of the symbol to that which it sym- bolizes is required by both the theory of dialectical affirmation and negation and by the theory of symbolic participation. Taken in conjunction with the metaphor of a transparent medium, however, they lead only to confusion. The metaphor becomes very "mixed" indeed. "Transparency" is really too passive a concept to describe the symbolic power of physical actualities. In other contexts Tillich speaks of the power or inherent capacity of the symbol to penetrate through the layers of reality to uncover its underlying basis in the ground of being. In this instance the medium is not itself transparent but is capable of rendering intervening layers trans- parent. It is the function of symbols to open up levels of being and levels of the soul which symbols alone can open.'8 The symbol opens up a level of meaning which otherwise is closed. It opens up a stratum of reality, of meaning and being which otherwise we could not reach; and in doing so, it participates in that which it opens. And it does not only open up a stratum of reality, it also opens up the corresponding stratum of the mind.19 Tillich usually cites only one example for this active revealing power of the symbolic medium, but this example is decisive; it is the role of art in expressing dimensions of reality not otherwise available to man. He speaks of visual art, yet this symbolic power is equally present in poetry or music. Such artistic works express levels of reality which remain hidden in our ordinary encounter with reality. In relation to these levels they are symbolic even if they try to be as naturalistic as pos- sible. The tree in an picture by Ruysdael is symbolic for treehood, but it is not the beautiful copy of a possibly real tree. It is the impression of a level of experience which may be provoked by an actual tree. But the picture does not depict the actual tree. It transforms it into a symbol.20 Here the affinities between the symbol and that which it symbolizes are capitalized upon. The particular experience of treehood which this picture evokes results in part from the resemblances between the picture and actual trees. The particular danger involved in any ascription of intrinsic similarity to the symbol is also present: the identification of the symbol with its referent. We may fall into the error of thinking of the picture as a quasi-photographic copy of actual trees. If it is understood as a symbol, however, the intrinsic similarities that point to treehood may be affirmed while rejecting those aspects that direct our attention to particular actual trees. In this fashion the symbol becomes</page><page sequence="14">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 117 transparent, not in the passive sense of merely permitting the dimension of depth to shine through by removing any distortion, but in the active sense of enhancing or evoking our apprehension of its profundity. The symbol uses its own intrinsic powers to call forth from us this apprehension, and does not sim- ply rely upon the removal of existential dross to accomplish its task. On occasion Tillich applies this active interpretation of the symbolic medium to religious symbols, indicating the indispensability of the symbolic approach. Religious symbols point to ultimate reality, the deepest level of being, the level of "the ground of being" which is not a level but the creative ground of all levels. They open up this "level" and they alone can do it. Discursive language (for instance, arguments for the existence of God or similar non-religious activities) is unable to open up ulti- mate reality, the level of the holy. And discursive language does not express the ground of the soul in which the holy is experienced.21 The non-symbolic approach to God therefore lacks the power inherent in the symbolic method for penetrating the depths of existence. This claim is justified if it can be shown that the peculiar aspects of reality which can only be re- vealed by symbols are essential to the nature of being-itself. We agree with Tillich that symbols are able to fathom religious dimensions that otherwise would be inaccessible, just as the work of art may evoke a particular aesthetic response of commitment and devotion to the ultimate which no abstract argument can provide. Symbols open up the dimension of ultimate concern. At the same time, however, we may question whether all assertions about being-itself belong to this dimension. Is it a dimension that yields itself only in the presence of the concrete images of art? Even if lan- guage, in poetry and literature, may evoke the expressive power of the plastic arts, it is doubtful whether this is the conceptual language of philosophy and systematic theology. III. SYMBOLIC PARTICIPATION In contrast with signs, which arbitrarily designate that for which they stand, symbols participate in that which they symbolize. As a symbol opens up a level of reality that otherwise remains inaccessible, "it participates in that which it opens."22 That which is participated in is variously described; sometimes it is the reality symbolized,23 sometimes it is the power of the divine to which it points (ST, I, 239), twice it is the power and meaning of that which is sym- bolized.24 It is emphasized that the symbol participates, while the sign does not. In this section we wish to inquire as to what is meant by such symbolic participation, to see on what grounds the symbol wields a power denied to mere signs and concepts. In the Theology of Culture two examples of symbolic participation are pro- vided. The flag participates in the power of the king or nation for which it stands, and the king is a symbol of the power of the people he rules over while partly exercising this power (TC, 55). The precise meaning of "participation," however, is not fully clear. The flag vacillates between a sign and a symbol de- pending upon the degree of associations and connotative overtones that have accrued to it. "Baker," the nautical flag representing the letter b, is merely a</page><page sequence="15">118 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION sign. The British union jack, on the other hand, is associated with the struggles of the English people, particularly with their military victories such as Water- loo and Trafalgar. Nautical conventions, such as striking the flag in order to indicate surrender, have enhanced the symbolic importance of national flags. Flags wield symbolic power if the conventional interpretation is respected whereby treatment of the flag indicates one's attitude toward the nation it represents. For many Americans this convention has become quite artificial; their behavior toward the flag has become careless and their attitude toward "flag-waving" contemptuous. The flag becomes more than a sign only if tradi- tional attitudes and patterns of behavior prevail. As a symbol it has power, but it is the power to evoke certain responses and to inspire respect. This power is not the power of the nation it represents, which includes the power to levy taxes and administer justice. While it possesses symbolic power, it is difficult to see how the flag participates in the power of the nation it symbolizes. The "power" in question is quite different in the two instances. The example of the king is somewhat different because he exercises the na- tional power. In exercising this power he participates in the national power, and there is an intrinsic similarity, if not an identity, between the power he exercises and the power residing in the national state as a whole. Yet we may ask whether he participates in this power by means of his symbolic power. A king symbolizes more than the power of the state he rules; he also symbolizes the more general concepts of sovereignty and legality and may symbolize the manifestation of divine will. In the latter instances he participates in sovereignty, legality, and the divine will by being an example of these concepts or a manifestation of their efficacy. While the king symbolizes power in general by being an example of power, he does not participate in the power of the nation unless he is able to exercise this power through government. This difference is more evident in instances where there is a split between the actual power of the state and its symbolic representation such as in a constitutional monarchy. While the mon- archy carries considerable symbolic importance because of its past associations with the power of the empire, this symbolic power is not the power of the state. This symbol does not participate in the power it symbolizes if participation means "having a share of this power." Symbolic participation is absent from Tillich's earlier essays on symbols. In explaining the difference between a sign and a symbol, he speaks of the sym- bol's "innate power." This implies that the symbol has a power inherent within it that distinguishes it from the mere sign which is impotent in itself. This characteristic is decisive for the dis- tinction between a sign and a symbol. The sign is interchangeable at will. It does not arise from necessity, for it has no inner power. The symbol, however, does possess a necessary character. It cannot be exchanged. It can only disappear when, through dis- solution, it loses its inner power. Nor can it be merely constructed; it can only be created.25 The principal evidence, then, for this inherent power in symbols is the fact that symbols cannot be simply interchanged for one another or given an arbi- trary meaning. Symbols are necessary in the sense that they are non-arbitrary.</page><page sequence="16">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 119 Two factors establish their non-arbitrariness: connotative suggestiveness and intrinsic similarity. The denotations of words may be established by arbitrary or conventional definition, but every word used in a variety of contexts accumulates additional nuances of meaning which cannot be disregarded. By insisting upon rigid defini- tion the philosopher may try to suppress these connotative overtones. Alterna- tively, he may draw upon these additional associations to aid in conveying his meaning. For example, Tillich uses the overtones of the Platonic and Neo- Platonic theories of participation, as well as the mystical notions of losing one- self in the divine life, to help convey what he means by symbolic participation. Use of such connotative overtones, particularly in religious context, frequently enables Tillich to express his meaning in richer, and perhaps more precise, terms than purely denotative concepts would have allowed. This method has the attendant danger, however, that the richness of these associations may camou- flage weaknesses in his reasoning.26 Since words with the same denotative mean- ing rarely have the same connotative overtones, it is difficult to find exact syno- nyms. This is the primary reason for the irreplaceability of most symbols. If symbolic power means the capacity to resist replacement by other symbols or concepts, then it is a power primarily derived from added presence of these associated meanings. Tillich may have had this connotative aspect of meaning in mind in his essay, "Nature and Sacrament," where he contrasts two possible interpretations of the relationship between the word as a natural phenomenon and the word as the bearer of meaning: The one possibility is to deprive the word of its intrinsic power and deny any essen- tial relation between the word and the meaning it bears. The power, the significance, the penetrating force of words is then attributed to the meaning which could be ex- pressed as well by other words. The words are thought of as arbitrarily interchange- able. The other possibility [which Tillich endorses] is to consider the sound and the meaning as bound together in such a way that the natural power of words becomes the necessary bearer of its power of meaning, so that the one is not possible without the other.27 If the "natural power of words" is understood simply as the natural phenom- enon itself, the sounds uttered or the signs written down, then Tillich seems committed to some form of onomatopoeia as the basis for the meaning of words. The existence of a multiplicity of languages should dispel any view that the sound of words is intrinsically bound up with their meanings. Tillich has ex- pressed himself badly by distinguishing between the word and its meaning. If we make the distinction between denotation and connotation, however, we may insist upon the interlocking nature of meanings within particular contexts to indicate some intrinsic connection between the basic and associated meanings of words. Then the "natural power of words" refers to their connotative over- tones. These are not accidentally appended to the basic denotation of a word, but make that particular word "the necessary bearer of its power and meaning." Edwin E. Aubrey questioned Tillich's phrase, "the inherent power of sym- bols," finding it impossible to ascribe any innate metaphysical power to the</page><page sequence="17">120 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION symbol as such.28 In reply, Tillich sought to express the inherent power of the symbol by distinguishing the symbol from the sign in terms of intrinsic similar- ity. Symbols are nearer to the reality expressed in them. Their direct, immediate, non- symbolic nature must have an original affinity to the symbolic content they represent. If water is used in religious rites, not the power of water as such has the religious ef- fect, but the ritual context in which it stands. But it stands in this context, because it has natural qualities through which it is adequate to its ritual use (purification, regen- eration, death and birth, etc.).29 Their inherent power is constituted by their irreplaceability, and such symbols cannot be replaced because of their natural affinity to that which they symbol- ize. In some instances a symbol may have power by virtue of its connotative associations and its intrinsic affinities. Because of its use in prayer, in ritual, in theology, and even in blasphemy, the word "God" has rich and powerful asso- ciations which render it more than simply a sign for being-itself as the object of man's ultimate concern. Understood as the supreme being, "God" also possesses qualities and characteristics that are intrinsically similar to the unconditioned nature of being-itself. A supreme being would come the closest to emulating the nature of being-itself and is therefore a fitting symbol for it.30 This particular example indicates how symbolic power dependent upon intrinsic similarity is not restricted to material entities but may apply to words and concepts such as "God." No sharply defined line can be drawn between these two characteristics of symbolic power. The natural affinities of the symbol with its referent generate their own associated meanings which merge with the symbol's total meaning and power. Because of the natural affinity between procreation and that act of divine origination which is neither creation or production, "Father" and "Son" are appropriate symbols for two members of the Trinity. Yet many additional meanings are also present: the sonship of Christ; his filial obedience to the Father; the Father's benevolent care of men, his children-meanings attendant upon the natural relationship of human parenthood transcending its strict denotative import. Because of this rich intertwining of natural affinity with connotative overtones, the symbols "Father" and "Son" have persisted as de- scriptions of the Trinitarian hypostases, in spite of technical difficulties and popular distortions (such as considering each Trinitarian person as a distinct sentient being). One may be convinced that the Trinitarian doctrine requires extensive revision and yet be thoroughly reluctant to interfere with the symbols of Father, Son, and Spirit, which have become so embedded in the life and worship of the church. Only connotative overtones render it possible to distin- guish between the two forms of procession within the Trinity, the generation of the Son, and the spiration of the Spirit. These two factors, connotative suggestiveness and intrinsic similarity, were the only characteristics of symbolic power developed or directly implied in Tillich's earlier essays. More recently he has reinforced this claim for symbolic</page><page sequence="18">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 121 power by holding that the symbol participates in that which it symbolizes. What additional meaning, if any, does this assertion supply? Can it also account for these other two characteristics of symbolic power? In order to determine what additional meaning symbolic participation may provide, we must consider more precisely the general meaning that "participa- tion" has in Tillich's writings. It is an extremely rich concept, as Tillich is quite aware: The concept of participation has many functions. A symbol participates in the reality it symbolizes; the knower participates in the known; the lover participates in the be- loved; the existent participates in the essences which make it what it is, under the con- dition of existence; the individual participates in the destiny of separation and guilt; the Christian participates in the New Being as it is manifest in Jesus the Christ. In polarity with individualization, participation underlies the category of relation as a basic ontological element [ST, I, 177]. R. N. Smart has criticized this passage for introducing hidden transitions be- tween assertions of different logical types.3' We may apply the same criticism to the hidden transitions made in the meaning of "participation." In this passage alone, "participation" is used to signify: an intimate connection between a thing and its sign based on connotative overtones, the epistemological relation- ship in which the knower is affected by what he knows, the effect of an inten- sive personal encounter, the logical ordering of particular and universal, the demand that man "live with" the results of his own acts and of those surround- ing him, and the reality of salvation through Christ. In the light of this diversity of meaning, we propose to classify the various types of participation and determine to what extent they shed light on the mean- ing of symbolic participation. We may distinguish at least five kinds according to Tillich's usage, which we have labeled causal, inclusive, receptive, environ- mental, and essential participation. Only the last two, properly speaking, are relevant to symbolic participation. 1. Causal participation signifies the effect's participation in its cause. If B participates in A causally, then A causes B. The effect participates in its cause as the outcome or result of that cause. This kind of participation is not very ex- plicit in Tillich, although quite common to other thinkers, such as Thomas Aquinas. Yet it may well underlie Tillich's insistence that finite beings possess the power of being only through participation.32 It is implicit in his statements that "an individual leaf participates in the natural structures and forces which act upon it" (ST, I, 176) and that a man participates in his own destiny in the sense that the results of his own actions will tend to affect him later on. The epistemological relation may also be subsumed under causal participation, since that which is known causally affects the knower. The symbol may be caused by that in which it symbolically participates, but this causal participation will not explain its symbolic power. All religious sym- bols are ultimately caused by being-itself, but this is true of all finite reality. If causal participation could characterize symbolic participation, we would have to be able to explain why much finite reality has so little symbolic power in</page><page sequence="19">122 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION pointing to the divine. Symbols vary greatly in their intensity and power, while they should, according to causal participation, all equally well symbolize being- itself. 2. Inclusive participation signifies the relation of a being to that which it in- cludes. Thus man "participates" in the subhuman realm, because the physical, chemical, biological, and psychological levels are found within him (ST, I, 260- 61) ." This sense of participation may be used to describe the way in which God "participates" in the creatures. Such statements "can have the unfortunate logical implication that there is something alongside God in which he partici- pates from the outside. But the divine participation creates that in which it participates" (ST, I, 245). This "creative" participation is the direct opposite of causal participation, for it means that the cause participates in the effect, rather than the effect in the cause. It is a very remarkable meaning for partici- pation, since participation generally signifies an asymmetrical relation in which the inferior "shares in" the superior. For this reason it cannot help us in ex- plaining the way in which the religious symbol participates in the power of being-itself. Whatever explanatory power it possesses is directed toward the opposite relationship of God to creature. It is Tillich's application of the ontological polarity of individualization and participation to the divine life which requires this use of participation. Since these polar concepts must be balanced, he declares that if God is understood to be the absolute individual he must also be understood as the absolute partici- pant (ST, I, 244 f.). 3. Receptive participation signifies openness and sensitivity toward that which is participated in. In this sense the knower participates in the known, and the lover participates in the beloved. Tillich understands the act of knowing dialectically, as a polar relation be- tween distance and union, or between detachment and participation. Scientific knowledge is predominantly detached from its object and is affected only in rigidly limited ways. Nevertheless, even science retains a participative element in its curiosity, in its desire to grapple with the real for its own sake.34 At the other end of the spectrum, religious knowledge demands a maximum of partici- pation. That which ultimately concerns us "cannot be discovered by detached observation or by conclusions derived from such observation. It can be found only in acts of surrender and participation" (ST, I, 44). The whole of a per- son's life participates in the revelatory experience,3" for the reception of revela- tion depends not only on one's capacity for intellectual insight and sensitive awareness but requires personal decision and existential commitment. In its most intensive form, receptive participation passes over into what we might call existential participation, the state of active commitment. In this sense of dedication, even identification, one "participates" in the Communist move- ment or in the Christian faith. At this level, existential participation involves trusting one's whole being to some transcending reality. In either form, receptive participation depends upon the capacity of the participant to respond to and become actively engaged with that which is participated in. This poses a serious limitation on the relevance and usefulness</page><page sequence="20">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 123 of receptive participation for symbolic participation, since response and engage- ment are not universal characteristics of symbols. Persons symbolic of the divine, such as the Christ, fully demonstrate the intensity of such a response and commitment, but inanimate objects, such as the sacramental bread and wine, lack this power. It is totally inapplicable to concepts used as symbols. 4. Environmental participation points to the individual's real relatedness to that which surrounds him. In varying degrees he is affected by that which is "outside of" him: his environment, the persons he encounters, the society in which he lives, the past which he has inherited, the general character of the world in which he finds himself, and even "the belongingness of being." This meaning of participation is fully developed by Tillich in his section on the ontological elements of individualization and participation (ST, I, 174-78), for it is his contention that man only becomes fully individual to the extent to which he is able to participate in every dimension of that which surrounds him. Such environmental participation may help explain the symbol's relatedness to associated connotations. Signs are totally independent of their surroundings. One will do just as well as another in a particular position. Symbols, however, are imbedded in particular contexts and webs of meaning, and it is their partici- pation in these surrounding meanings which gives the symbols their rich con- notations. As Plato pointed out in the Cratylus, the growth of interconnections among words in the course of a language's history renders certain key words impervious to a simple substitution. Any attempt to remove them would destroy the fabric of associations which is just as much a part of the language as the direct denotative meanings. Symbols derive their power, insofar as this is de- pendent upon connotative overtones, from their participation in surrounding meanings. 5. Essential participation explains the relationship between particular and universal. It has had a long history, initiated by Plato's suggestion that particu- lar actualities "participate" in the eternal Forms. The way in which actualities, particularly living organisms, are characterized by both the general and the special structures of reality may be explained by this kind of participation.36 If a relation may be conceived as a peculiar kind of universal, then essential par- ticipation may also account for the nature of relations. A good deal of the apparent cogency of Tillich's argument, in his analysis of individualization and participation, rests upon a silent transition from environ- mental to essential participation. Since the first is quite concrete and the second is rather abstract, it is easy to assume that Tillich has also accounted for the intermediate stages and thereby made a valid metaphysical generalization. Yet this required continuity is lacking, and these two meanings remain quite dis- parate. Essential participation, however, does aid in explaining any intrinsic similar- ity which the symbol may have with that which it symbolizes. Two things that are similar participate in the same property. But the property belongs primarily to that which is symbolized and secondarily to the symbol. If there is a natural resemblance, we may say that the symbol participates in this property which the symbolized reality enjoys.</page><page sequence="21">124 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION In summary, then, we find that participation as developed by Tillich does help explain the two features of symbolic power already present in the earlier writings. Environmental participation can account for connotative suggestive- ness, while essential participation may explain intrinsic similarity. On the other hand, participation does not significantly add any new features. For this reason we find Tillich's use of symbolic participation misleading, because we are apt to broaden its meaning to include extraneous factors. Symbolic participation means nothing more than that the symbol bears associative overtones which the sign does not possess and that it possibly bears natural resemblances with that which is symbolized. These two meanings are best expressed explicitly and directly, without recourse to the more inclusive (and hence more confusing) concept of participation. IV. CONCLUSION AND EVALUATION The religious symbol is required by Tillich's thought for at least two dif- ferent purposes. It must perform two distinct though closely allied functions, which we shall designate as its religious and its metaphysical functions. To ful- fill its religious function, the symbol must be capable of representing that which ultimately concerns us. It must serve as a vehicle for our commitment and devotion, receiving its full meaning only within this context. It must also protect us from idolatry, that is, from substituting a proximate and finite reality for that which is ultimate. In its metaphysical function the religious symbol must be capable of desig- nating that which is ontologically prior to all beings and beyond the categorical requirements of the structure of being. All metaphysical and epistemological concepts that describe the general character of reality, however, are restricted to the realm of beings. In order to be applied beyond the context of particular finite actualities, these concepts must be symbolically transformed, retaining their original meaning insofar as this does not conflict with the requirement to represent that which is not a being. These two functions of religious symbols are distinct in the sense that we apply different criteria for adequacy. To test the adequacy of its metaphysical function, we must determine whether the concept in question can be so trans- formed that it still preserves part of its primary meaning while symbolically it designates being-itself. This is a philosophical inquiry, made with theoretical detachment, based upon an understanding of being-itself and the power of being, on the one hand, and an understanding of the structure of being, its ontological elements and categories, on the other. The relevant question is whether the structure of being significantly represents being-itself in any given instance-a question that can only be resolved by the patient use of discursive, theoretical reasoning. The religious adequacy of a symbol, however, cannot be ascertained apart from an ultimate concern, whether this be the concern of the persons using these symbols or of the persons receiving such symbolic meanings. Apart from this special context, the religious import of the symbol is negligible. Its religious adequacy cannot be tested in any objective fashion, for what we are testing is the expression of faith. The proper test can only be its appropriateness</page><page sequence="22">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 125 in expressing the ultimate concern of the community of faith, and this test can be applied only from within that community. This distinction between the two functions of religious symbols is crucial for any assessment of Tillich's theory. The three analyses we have examined must be evaluated differently according to each of these two functions. On the whole his theory is much more appropriate to the religious function. In describing the religious function, Tillich contends that ultimate concern can only be expressed in terms of symbols. Our abstract concepts, in them- selves, are pale images or sketchy notations which only become clothed with flesh and blood in the presence of an ultimate concern. Symbols are required for communication of this concern among persons, and for participation in com- mon worship of the divine. Apart from the context of faith these symbols are inadequate. The attempt to take such symbols literally is both irreligious and futile. It is irreligious because it arrogantly assumes that we can grasp their real meaning without any cost on our part, without our own personal commit- ment to that which ultimately concerns us. It is futile because these symbols will not yield their meaning to a purely theoretical analysis. Under its glare we find that the symbols simply reduce to the affirmation that God is being-itself or the source of being. Then we lose the purpose of the rich diversity of sym- bols employed, which is to direct our attention to the different ways in which we can religiously relate ourselves to God and find communion with Him. Apart from ultimate concern, the question of our relatedness to God evapo- rates, and we are left simply with the bare assertion of the object of this related- ness: God, or "God is God." According to Tillich's analysis, we also know that God is being-itself, but this is due to the fact that Tillich's own account of the symbolic approach rests upon a metaphysical as well as upon a religious founda- tion. If we limit ourselves solely and directly to a religious foundation for sym- bolic predication of God, we find that we are left with nothing but a referent without content, a mere cipher, "God." The language of ultimate concern fares badly when subjected to a non-symbolic theoretical analysis. The three strands of Tillich's symbolic theory have real strength when examined purely in terms of the demands of the religious life. They clearly demonstrate the inadequacy of the symbols taken non-symbolically, that is, apart from ultimate concern. The symbols cannot simply or literally affirm truth about God; in ultimate concern we realize that any purely affirmative utterance about Him, no matter how qualified, oversteps its bounds and falsifies itself. Therefore we use symbols instead of direct predication in order to affirm and deny in the same breath the import of our halting language. Or we may argue that the symbols are adequate only insofar as they reveal to us that which ulti- mately concerns us, and this cannot be themselves. In literal predication we must take the terms used quite seriously, for they define and delimit the reality we are examining. We must forever look beyond or through the symbols because they themselves lack that which we are seeking. If we look to them directly, they get in the way; they become opaque and no longer reveal that which ulti- mately concerns us. Finally, symbolic participation points to the irreplaceability of the symbols, because the rich connotations would be lost if one symbol were discarded in</page><page sequence="23">126 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION favor of another with the same denotation. These connotations of religious sym- bols (when legitimate grounds for their irreplaceability exist) grow out of meaningful interaction between persons sharing the same ultimate concern, and directly express that concern. Other connotations that arise apart from ultimate concern do not help the religious symbol to be more adequate. Irre- placeability by itself, however, is not enough. We may say that the cross is a central symbol of the Christian faith and cannot be discarded without consider- able loss, but we must be careful to note that the permanence of this symbol depends upon its power to recall to us the sacrifice of the Christ as the deepest expression of ultimate concern. Otherwise we will be required to maintain that other symbols associated with the church through the ages are just as adequate to reveal the Divine if they are felt to be irreplaceable, such as Gothic arches, stained-glass windows, robed choirs, and incense. Our criterion cannot be simply that Christian congregations feel that these cannot be discarded. If they are not to be discarded, then their rich connotations should have grown out of, and remain expressive of, ultimate concern. Had Tillich confined his remarks concerning the symbols to these considera- tions, his theory of symbolic predication would have been unassailable. But then symbols would no longer be part of a philosophical theology, and the assertion that God is being-itself would be quite foreign to his enterprise. The religious symbols, examined theoretically apart from personal commitment, yield only the analytic truth that God is that which ultimately concerns those who are ulti- mately concerned. Tillich's analysis of the religious symbols, however, includes an ontological dimension in terms of which a theoretical examination produces the synthetic assertion that God is also being-itself. He goes outside the dimen- sion of ultimate concern alone to make the characteristic assertion of Christian philosophical speculation that the ultimate being must also be the source of being (ST, I, 235). Moreover, this assertion, contained in the proposition that "God is Being-itself," is the only non-symbolic statement about God that Til- lich allows (ST, I, 238). Only the dialectic of affirmation and negation provides theoretical support for the metaphysical function of symbols. However much symbolic participa- tion in terms of connotative overtones may be needed for their religious func- tion, it hinders the precise expression of metaphysical assertions about being- itself. Perhaps philosophical theology cannot be divorced from the life of the church, but the systematic demands of philosophical and theological expression place symbols in a more rigorous context which excludes non-systematic asso- ciations derived from worship. In terms of natural affinity, symbolic participa- tion is best expressed in terms of affirmation coupled with the dialectic of simul- taneous negation. The other theoretical basis for symbols, the metaphor of transparency, is only applicable to physical actualities. It does not explain the symbolic use of concepts that comprise the medium of metaphysical analysis. The dialectic of affirmation and negation in turn poses grave problems. For one thing, it gives an inordinate advantage to any non-symbolic statements which can be made about the ultimate, for these constitute the only pure affirmations concerning being-itself that can be made. Since in every symbolic</page><page sequence="24">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 127 statement negative elements are inextricably intertwined with affirmative ele- ments, our sole guide to their affirmative content must lie in their agreement with these non-symbolic statements. In many cases it becomes problematic whether they actually express any affirmative content beyond the simple asser- tion that God is being-itself. Anything beyond this point is instantly involved in negation. Second, this principle of simultaneous affirmation and negation easily de- generates into a device for avoiding philosophical criticism. Since these two dimensions cannot be finally distinguished from one another, it becomes enor- mously difficult to ascertain just what is being affirmed of being-itself. The twin dangers of anthropomorphism and agnosticism may be avoided too easily. One can argue that God is not like man by emphasizing the negative aspects of all symbolic expressions, while on the other hand holding that he is not so total- ly dissimilar from our situation that he cannot be known. Depending upon the direction from which the attack is made, the affirmative or the negative dimen- sions of the symbol may be stressed, since both are always present. This is a Protean way to meet honest criticism. Third, this dialectic may become a device for oversimplifying metaphysical analysis. We need only determine the way in which traditional meanings of metaphysical concepts do and do not apply to being-itself, and then assert that since both affirmation and denial is involved, the concept must be treated as a symbol. Thus cause applies to being-itself insofar as it is the source of being for other beings, but not insofar as every cause is a member of the causal series and an effect of some previous cause. In thereby elevating "cause" to the status of a symbol pointing toward being-itself, we undercut the need to engage in the patient effort to discern a precisely qualified univocal meaning of cause which could be appropriately applied to being-itself. Specification of the affirmative and negative elements is sufficient for Tillich's purposes. It is not necessary to show how the negative qualifications are compatible with the affirmative core, or even how their union is intelligible, for this has been established a priori by the dialectical character of the symbol. We find, then, that Tillich's three strands, whether taken singly or jointly, constitute an adequate theory for the religious use of symbols to articulate our ultimate concern, but that their metaphysical use, on the other hand, remains problematic. Only the dialectic of affirmation and negation can apply to the use of strictly defined terms, and here we find that Tillich's criteria are much more explicit in what is being denied than in what is being affirmed. The Sys- tematic Theology depends upon the use of metaphysical concepts that symboli- cally refer to being-itself, but in applying them to being-itself the necessary foundation of these concepts in particular beings must be thoroughly negated. On what grounds can we be confident that there remains any affirmative mean- ing to these symbols once they have passed through such an exacting via nega- tiva? In the final analysis, it is doubtful whether Tillich's symbolic approach enables us to know anything more about being-itself than that which is already implied in the non-symbolic approach, namely, that being-itself is not a being but the source of all being.</page><page sequence="25">128 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION NOTES 1.

If we continue to speak of "ordinary" philosophical concepts, we simply intend to designate these concepts insofar as they are derived from the sphere of finite reality and continue to be used non-symbolically. It is misleading to speak of "ordinary" philosophical concepts in any broader sense, since each one is derived from and dependent upon some philosophical tradition, often one that is quite complex and sophisticated. If such concepts as "substance" and "causality" seem more ordinary than "prehension," this simply reflects our greater familiarity with particular philosophical contexts. 3. See Frederick Ferr6, Language, Logic and God (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1965), p. 69. 4. E. L. Mascall, Existence and Analogy (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1949), p. 87. 5. This is a disputed point, for Tillich categorically denies that his conception of the basic on- tological polarities is derived from Schelling. See our interchange in Philosophical Interrogations, ed. Sydney and Beatrice Rome (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1964), pp. 358-59. Tillich rejects Schelling's potencies because of their hierarchical tendency. Schelling formally adopts a triadic structure which naturally invites comparison with Hegel's dialectic, but we find it much more exciting to read Schelling in terms of Tillich's polarities. Hegel's dialectic progresses hierarchically in that the resolution to any particular opposition becomes the first or positive element on the next level of the dialectic. Neither Tillich nor Schelling allows for such resolutions. While there is some measure of development in Schelling, it is primarily a process of gradual refinement of the polar opposites through steady intensification of their mutual opposition, and not an hierarchical advance from one level to the next. Schelling does have a third term, but this term is not another polar ele- ment in the process but, rather, something like the field or matrix in which the dialectic occurs combined with a sense of its inner telos. Tillich, we feel, has conceptually clarified Schelling's dialec- tic by expressing it in a dyadic form. For an appreciative account of his relationship to Schelling, see Tillich's essay, "Schelling und die Anfiinge des existentialistischen Protestes," Zeitschrift fiir philosophische Forschung, IX (1955), 197-208. 6.

"Die Uberwindung des Religionsbegriffs in der Religions-philosophie" first appeared in the Kant-Studien, XXVII (1922) 446-69. It has been reprinted in the Friihe Hauptwerke, ed. Renate Albrecht (Stuttgart: Evangelisches Verlagswerk, 1959), pp. 367-88. The topics Tillich here considers under "philosophy of religion" appear in later writings under "philosophical theology." 8. In the earlier writings Tillich describes the ultimate in Kantian terms as the Unconditioned. Being-itself, associated with the creative power of being as well as with the classical notion of ipsum esse, does not yet appear. Tillich's choice of being-itself may have been influenced by Heidegger's ontological difference between Sein and Seiende. 9. Friihe Hauptwerke, p. 367: "da es als Unbedingtes seinem Wesen nach jenseits des Gegensatzes von Subjekt und Objekt steht." 10. Ibid., p. 377: "Der entscheidende Einwand, den wir gegen die bisherige Religionsphilosophie erhoben, ist der, dass sie das Unbedingte auf das Bedingte griindet entweder durch Nebenordnung oder, da diese unertriglich ist, durch Aufl6sung des Unbedingten in das Bedingte. Eine Religions- philosophie, die dem Wesen des Unbedingten gerecht werden will, muss das Unbedingte in allem Bedingten erfassen, als das, was sich selbst und das Bedingte begriindet. Das Bedingte ist das Medium, in dem und durch das hindurch das Unbedingte erfasst wird. . ... Daraus folgt, dass der Sinn jeder Aussage ilber das Unbedingte prinzipiell unterschieden sein muss vom dem Sinn jeder Aussage iiber Bedingtes. Da aber jede Aussage als solche in dem Schema von Subjekt und Objekt, also in den Formen des Bedingten verliiuft, so muss die Aussage Uiber das Unbedingte diese Formen zwar benutzen, aber doch so, dass ihr Unzuliingliches offenbar wird, d.h. sie muss die Form der sys- tematischen Paradoxie tragen." 11. Ibid., p. 381: "Diese Formung ist die Paradoxie, d.h. zugleich die Bejahung und Verneinung der autonomen Form. Das religi6se Denken, Anschauen ist also ein Denken, ein Anschauen, das die autonomen Formen des Denkens und Anschauens zugleich benutzt und zerbricht." [The German zugleich, which we have translated by "at once" and "at the same time," carries no necessary tem- poral connotations. This suggests that Tillich intends the same meaning as zugleich in those pas- sages in the Systematic Theology which speak of the polar interdependence of the symbolic aspects</page><page sequence="26">THE THREE STRANDS OF TILLICH'S THEORY 129 in terms of simultaneity. He employs the temporal metaphor only to satisfy the exigencies of English style.] 12. Ibid., p. 388: "Die Theonomie ist sieghaft, solange sie lebendiger Durchbruch ist, solange die Paradoxie als Paradoxie erlebt wird. Sie ist aber dem Verhiingnis verfallen, immer wieder aus dem lebendigen Paradox einen objektiven Widerspruch machen zu miissen . . ." 13. These strictures against natural theology are quite valid, but they do not justify the whole- sale rejection of the enterprise. While the philosophical counterpart of the God of faith may be quite abstract, it plays a crucial role in the formation of a completely integrated philosophy. Nat- ural theology may not be necessary for faith, but it is essential to metaphysics. 14. "The Word of God," in Language: An Enquiry into Its Meanings and Function, ed.

This particular essay has had a long and involved pub- lishing history, indicative of the importance Tillich attaches to it. It first appeared as a paper in Bltter fiir deutsche Philosophie, Vol. I, No. 4 (1928), reprinted in the Religiiise Verwirklichung (Berlin: Furche Verlag, 1930), pp. 88-109, with some additional seventeen footnotes (pp. 284-86).

In a slightly re-edited form, this essay was published in Daedalus, LXXXVII (Summer, 1958), pp. 3-21, and reprinted in Symbolism in Religion and Literature, ed. Rollo May (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1960), pp. 75-98.

"Eternal life" is the gift of salvation, but it is a qualitative dimension of this present life, not an endless existence after death.

Tillich's metaphor of depth, for example, has been challenged on the grounds of improper reliance on associated connotations. R. N. Smart ("Being and the Bible," Review of Metaphysics, IX [June, 1956], 594) substitutes the term "higher levels" for Tillich's "deeper levels," explaining that " 'higher' has less value-force, and so is more antiseptic." "Higher" is less suggestive than "deeper," but the real question is whether Tillich is entitled to the additional connotations which the word "depth" possesses. In Tillich's usage, "depth" primarily signifies ultimacy, and this pri- mary meaning may be equally expressed by the metaphor of "height." But the connotations of "depth" point to the capacity of the deepest level to support and sustain the other levels and to the necessity of penetrating through the other levels to reach this deepest level. Since Tillich iden- tifies this deepest level with being-itself and defends his position that being-itself supports all other beings in being, he is justified in using these additional connotations for the metaphor of "depth." In the case of participation, on the other hand, we believe that he is not entitled to all the asso- ciated meanings coupled with this concept. 27.

It is the desire to participate in that which is real and which by its reality, exerts an in- finite attraction on that being who is able to encounter reality as reality. Participation in that which has the power of being the really Real gives fulfillment to him who participates in it. Sci- entific curiosity, the desire to know for the sake of knowing, which Aristotle attributes to every man highlights the term controlling knowledge; and it points to the fact that there is an element of participation even at the scientific pole." 35.
