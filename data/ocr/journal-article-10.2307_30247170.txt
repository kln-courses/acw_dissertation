McGUIRE Department of Anthropology SUNY, Binghamton ANN VALDO HOWARD Office of Cultural Resource Management Arizona State University ABSTRACT This paper summarizes what is currently known about Hohokam shell exchange in the U.S. Southwest and attempts to interpret the role of this trade in Hohokam prehistory. Data gathered in the 1970s and 1980s and the application of quantitative methods in exchange analysis form the basis for this new synthesis. This synthesis treats Hohokam shell exchange in terms of regional specialization within a bounded exchange network. We further consider how Hohokam shell exchange changed between the Sedentary and Classic periods and examine the importance of these changes for our interpretations of Hohokam prehistory. Our synthesis is integrated by a social theory that incorporates productive relations, exchange relations, and the social meaning of shell. INTRODUCTION In among the mass of potsherds, lithics, and fragments of groundstone that make up the majority of a Hohokam artifact assemblage, a researcher usually finds at least a few pieces of shell ornaments. The uniqueness and fine craftsmanship of the shell artifacts seem to reflect the past with great acuity. Our purpose in this paper is to use this reflection to reconstruct the broad patterns of organization and change in the shell interaction system that brought marine shell to Hohokam sites. Many observers have been struck by the quantity and variety of marine shell in Hohokam sites. As early as 1846, a United States Army officer, Captain A. R. Johnston, noted and illustrated marine shell from archaeological sites in the Gila Bend region (Emory 1848:604). When intensive archaeological investigations of southern Arizona began in the 1920s, researchers quickly focused upon the origins of shell exchange. By World War II they had identified the marine sources of many of the shell genera and the basic parameters of their spatial distribution (Brand 1938: Colton 1941; Gladwin and others 1937; Haury 1945; Tower 1945). Out of this primary research developed a widely accepted reconstruction of Hohokam shell trade that was based on analogy to the Pima and Tohono O'odham (Papago). Recent research leads us to question many of the conclusions of the early analyses and to emphasize that Hohokam shell exchange was, at times, Editor's Note: The Kiva gratefully acknowledges a financial contribution from the Department of Anthropology, SUNY, Binghamton, to help defray the cost of publication of this paper. 113</page><page sequence="2">114 McGUIRE AND HOWARD embedded in forms of social organization markedly different from those of the historic Pima or Tohono O'odham. Understanding the role of shell use in the Hohokam economy and its place in the explanation of Hohokam prehistory requires examination of three interrelated topics: shell ornament production, the mechanisms of shell exchange, and the changing social contexts and meaning of shell within Hohokam society. THE TRADITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF HOHOKAM SHELL EXCHANGE Hohokam shell trade has been regarded as a phenomenon comparable to, and understandable in terms of, ethnographic Southwestern patterns of ex- change. Haury (1976:306) identified the Hohokam as the "shell merchants" of the Southwest involved in a network of trade similar in complexity and organization to Piman salt exchange (compare Underhill 1946:234). The Pima had an egalitarian system of exchange based on the heterogeneous distribution of subsistence goods and involving balanced exchange between individuals. For Haury (1976:321), participation in this network and the possession of most shell artifact types was "a matter of personal option" unrelated to rank or wealth. Based upon the work of Hayden (1972) in the Sierra Pinacate area of northwestern Sonora and of Fontana (1965) in the Arizona Papagueria, Haury (1976:306) postulated that Hohokam individuals traveled over petroglyph- marked trails from the Phoenix Basin to the Gulf of California and gathered shell along the beaches of Adair Bay. At centers in the Phoenix Basin, shell specialists then shaped this raw shell into articles of personal adornment. Many of these finished ornaments were exchanged north and east, spreading Hohokam influence as far away as Pueblo Bonito (Haury 1976:321; Urban 1981 b:219). A few of the rarer shell objects, such as Strombus trumpets and etched shell, were believed to have served the Hohokam as ritual items. The majority of the shell artifacts though, particularly the ubiquitous Glycymeris bracelet, functioned solely as ornamentation (Haury 1976:321). Despite evidence for major changes in the nature of the Hohokam shell industry, early researchers characterized the organization of shell production and exchange as having remained relatively stable through time. Finely-made shell ornaments appeared early in the Pioneer period and, from the beginning, the Glycymeris bracelet was generally the predominant artifact type. The Hohokam shell industry reached an artistic peak in the Sedentary period with a great profusion of forms, genera, manufacturing techniques, and designs (Gladwin and others 1937; Haury 1945). In the subsequent Classic period, the quantity of shell artifacts increased, but there was a decline in the number of types, techniques, and genera utilized (Haury 1945:159; Schroeder 1940:105). The Classic period also witnessed the general replacement of zoomorphic designs with more geometric representations.</page><page sequence="3">Hohokam Shell Exchange 115 Until recently, this reconstruction of Hohokam shell production and exchange has remained popular because it fit well with the contemporary interpretations of Hohokam culture and was consistent with the available data. Additional data and recent revisions in both our knowledge and interpretations of the Hohokam require a rethinking of this reconstruction. THE NEED FOR A NEW RECONSTRUCTION Much of what has been written about shell exchange in the last 40 years remains valid. Reconstructions of the sources of the shell, manufacturing techniques, and the utilization of the various genera have not been challenged by recent work; indeed, they have been constantly reinforced. However, the overall revision of Hohokam prehistory, the application of quantitative analyses to the shell trade, and new data resulting from Cultural Resource Management (CRM) research require modifications of the old perspective. Most contemporary researchers no longer interpret Hohokam prehistory in terms of a Piman analogy (Doyel 1977, 1979; McGuire 1983b; Upham and Rice 1980; Wilcox 1979; Wilcox and Shenk 1977; Wilcox, McGuire, and Sternberg 1981; Wood and McAllister 1980). A number of researchers cite the differential distribution of exotic goods in cremations and/or ballcourt ceremonialism as evidence for a Colonial-Sedentary elite or superior group of individuals (Doyel 1980; Nelson 1981; Teague 1984; Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). There has been some debate concerning a transformation of this hypothesized elite in the Classic period. A number of authors see a collapse at the end of the Sedentary period followed by the regrowth of an elite group in the latter half of the Classic period, the Civano phase (Doyel 1980; Nelson 1981; Wilcox n.d.). Others see a gradual development with increasing elite power and inequality from the Sedentary through the end of the Classic (Fish n.d.; McAllister 1976; McGuire 1983a; Teague 1984). Regardless of the resolution of this debate, models of exchange based upon a static, egalitarian form of social organization are questionable, and alternative models of Hohokam shell trade merit considera- tion. We favor positions that see a smoother trajectory of change in Hohokam prehistory. We interpret the differential distribution of exotic goods in mortuary contexts and ballcourt ceremonialism as evidence of a Colonial-Sedentary period elite, which may have derived its power from the distribution of valuables and from its ability to concentrate these items for ritual and social needs, such as funerals and marriages. This elite would have consisted of the leaders of lineages or extended families. Differentials in wealth and power most certainly existed between these social groups, but we do not see evidence of ranking at this time. The lack of strong differentiation in household architecture and other secular areas suggests this elite derived its power and position from the manipulation of ritual and religion, while maintaining an egalitarian ethos. For the Classic period, we would agree with those who interpret the appearance</page><page sequence="4">116 McGUIRE AND HOWARD of elite dwellings on platform mounds and of specialized administrative centers such as Casa Grande as evidence for an increase in elite power. A transforma- tion of kind, as well as degree, is implied here because, by the Classic period, a ranking of social groups had appeared and the elite groups seem to have gained control of more secular matters, including stored produce (McGuire 1983a), production of goods such as cloth (Wilcox n.d.), and management of irrigation systems (Gregory and Nials 1985). Recent quantitative studies form the basis for improved models of shell exchange. Beginning with the work of Renfrew, Cann, and Dixon (1965) on Aegean obsidian trade, archaeologists have devoted considerable attention to formal mathematical models of exchange. This general interest sparked several studies directly relevant to Hohokam shell trade, including Hudson's (1978) quantitative analysis of Southwestern prehistoric shell exchange, McGuire and Downum's (1982) regression analysis of shell and Kayenta pottery exchanged between the Phoenix Basin and the Flagstaff areas during the Colonial and Sedentary periods, McGuire and Schiffer's (1982) dummy regression analysis of shell exchange among the Papagueria, Gila Bend, and Phoenix Basin Hohokam, and Howard's (1983, 1985) contingency-table analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of shell manufacture and exchange throughout the Hohokam range. Teague (1984) has also produced a quantitative analysis that seeks to integrate all aspects of Hohokam exchange. These quantitative investigations, along with several recent qualitative or descriptive studies (Nelson 1981; Seymour 1985; Urban 1981a, 1981b, 1981c; Vokes 1983), provide new data and more powerful analyses of shell distributions. CRM research in the Southwest has greatly increased the amount of data available for the study of shell exchange throughout the Hohokam region, particularly within the Papagueria. Prior to the 1970s, our understanding of Papaguerian prehistory was based upon excavations conducted by the Arizona State Museum (ASM) (Haury 1950; Scantling 1940; Withers 1944) in that portion of the region east of Santa Rosa Wash, and upon the surveys of Fontana (1965), Ezell (1955), and Hayden (1972) in the western Papaqueria, that is, along and to the west of Santa Rosa Wash. The ASM excavations located large agricultural villages with very little shell and no evidence of shell artifact production. Surveys in the western Papagueria, on the other hand, found sites covered with debitage from shell manufacture. Those who conducted this research interpreted the sites as "camps" along the Hohokam shell procure- ment route to the beaches of the Gulf of California, and not as agricultural villages. More recent CRM-funded archaeology in the Papagueria has supported some of these observations while contradicting others. The excavation of Sil Nayak (Masse 1980) and several surveys (Brew and George 1979; Curriden 1977; McDonald and others 1974; Stacy 1975) in the eastern Papagueria verify the paucity of shell in this region. In the western Papagueria, however, several</page><page sequence="5">Hohokam Shell Exchange 117 excavations (Huckell 1979; Masse 1980; Raab 1974; Rosenthal and others 1978; Yablon 1978) and surveys (McGuire and Mayro 1978; Stacy 1975) discovered agricultural villages with large quantities of shell, primarily consist- ing of Glycymeris manufacturing waste. It is now clear that many of the sites formerly identified as the "camps" of Phoenix Basin shell-gatherers were in fact the villages of a resident Papaguerian population heavily involved in the production of shell artifacts. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS A new interpretation of Hohokam shell exchange must reflect recent methodological and theoretical concerns in the study of prehistoric trade, as well as include recent data and analyses. As several authors stress, archaeologi- cal studies of exchange must minimally address three issues: (1) the distribution of trade objects, (2) the organization of exchange, and (3) a consideration of how changes in trade affect, and are affected by, other aspects of culture (Earle 1982; McGuire and Schiffer 1982:241). We will deal with these issues together and will focus on two blocks of time - the combined Colonial and Sedentary periods and the Classic period. Due to a very small data base, Pioneer period shell assemblages are not included in the analysis. Since we realize that at no point in time was the Hohokam exchange network a closed system, we will also look at the variability within and between the Hohokam regional system and other aspects of the Southwestern-Mesoamerican "world system" (compare McGuire 1986; Plog, Upham, and Weigand 1982; Upham 1982). The issue of how shell exchange relates to the explanation of Hohokam prehistory is a difficult one with which to deal. For many years, archaeologists have attempted to use trade as a causal variable without making detailed interconnections between exchange and other aspects of social systems. It has become increasingly clear that the use of exchange in explanations of prehistory requires, first, a consideration of relationships among exchange, production, and consumption (Earle 1982), and second, an understanding of the social context and meaning of the exchanged goods (Hodder 1982a, 1982b). Production and exchange are closely related phenomena, because many of the basic variables determining production, such as the size of the population served, the kinds of goods traded, the technology involved, and the status of the producers, also determine exchange (Earle 1982:8). Ericson's (1982) analysis of California obsidian production and exchange suggested that production for exchange was sensitive to regional technology, and to the function of obsidian artifacts. Ammerman and Andrefsky (1982) discovered that certain Neolithic settlements in Italy specialized in the production of obsidian tools and were more active in obsidian exchange than were other settlements. Finally, Spence (1982) has identified a set of general relationships among social inequality, production, and exchange.</page><page sequence="6">118 McGUIRE AND HOWARD Just as production is tied directly to exchange, so too is consumption. Consumption relates to exchange in the very mechanical sense of demand, such that the volume of trade depends in part on the demand for the traded object. More importantly, however, demand results in part from the social meaning of the traded object. This meaning affects not only demand, but more importantly, the cultural value of the exchanged item (Hodder 1982a, 1982b). To integrate social meaning into an analysis of the past, we must consider how meaning relates to behavior and to material objects. Indeed, as long as we regard these relationships as arbitrary associations between belief and artifact form, meaning must remain a totally intractable variable. The association of form and meaning is not, however, an arbitrary or capricious process; it is, rather, a historically determined dialectic. Meaning stands in a dialectical relationship to behavior, which is to say, meaning determines behavior and behavior in turn, transforms meaning. This dialectic occurs within socially- defined, historically-specific contexts. As archaeologists, we can never ask a prehistoric Hohokam the meaning of his or her acts, but we can reconstruct the context and consequences of past behavior. For example, we can discover whether or not shell figured in ritual or status activities. If shell was primarily involved with ritual or status activities, we could infer that shell ornaments were not intended simply to satisfy individual aesthetics. Examining which individuals had shell, when, and in what situations provides clues as to the meaning of shell for legitimizing and reproducing religion and social distinctions. By reconstructing how the context of shell ornaments changed through time, we can identify alterations in its role in legitimizing, supporting, and providing the basis of power for interest groups, and we can discuss the historical processes by which these changes occurred (Hodder 1982a:207). The social context of objects also informs on processes of emulation. Objects of readily-available materials or of simple manufacture make poor symbols of power and status, because the majority of members in a society may be able to gain access to them. Once an object becomes widely available to the lower levels of society, the elite will replace it with a rarer or more costly symbol of status (Fallers 1971; Miller 1982; Schiffer 1976). In regional systems, objects associated with more powerful and complex centers com- monly serve to legitimize, symbolize, and form a basis of power for elites in peripheral areas (Flannery 1968). The use of Tlingit forms by an Athapaskan elite for wealth objects (Oberg 1973), or the local copying of Etruscan funeral goods and practices by Iron-Age German elites (Frankenstein and Rowlands 1978) provide examples of such regional emulations. In order to examine the historical processes that determine the dialectic between meaning and behavior, we need to discover archaeologically the historical and social contexts of artifacts. Archaeologists have developed a</page><page sequence="7">Hohokam Shell Exchange 119 large number of techniques for temporally separating artifacts, deposits, and features. These allow us to establish the historical contexts of artifacts. The initial steps towards establishing the social context of artifacts is to look for the patterned relationship of artifacts, features, and deposits - an enterprise we have engaged in for over a decade. Unlike earlier considerations of patterning, the method we are proposing requires that contexts be differentiated in terms of social parameters. One of the easiest such differentiations is the opposition between the secular and the sacred. Hohokam secular contexts would include pit houses, most secondary refuse, and utilitarian activity areas. Sacred contexts include primary and de facto refuse in ballcourts, burials, platform and capped mounds, and ritual caches. Similarity in form between objects from different regions does not indicate exact correspondence in meaning, but shared symbols must in some ultimate sense result from historical and social connections between areas. The nature of these connections can inform on the meaning that the objects may have had in each area. The contexts of shell artifacts among the Hohokam vary between regions, through time, and between the different kinds of ornaments. We argue that the meaning of shell artifacts changed in concert with broader changes in Hohokam prehistory. SHELL SOURCES AND TRADE ROUTES The shell found in Hohokam sites originates from three sources: (1) local rivers within southern Arizona, (2) the Pacific Coast of California (the Californian marine province), and (3) the northern area of the Gulf of California (within the Panamic marine province). The Hohokam produced small quan- tities of artifacts from the thin, brittle shell of the locally available freshwater genusAnodonta, having primarily collected the mollusks as supplemental food sources (Haury 1976:308). Southern Arizona and northern Sonora sites, in general, yield a negligible percentage of Pacific Coast taxa relative to Panamic genera (Brand 1938; Haury 1976; Nelson 1981; Tower 1945; Urban 1981a, 1981b). This paper deals only with the distribution of shell genera obtained from the Gulf of California, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of shell in southern Arizona and northern Sonora. The beaches along the northern portion of the Gulf of California provide an excellent environment for the collection of numerous shell genera. Tidal flats littered with an extremely rich shell fauna extend several miles into the Gulf (Berry 1956:81-84). The bleached color and beach-weathered condition of much of Hohokam shell indicates that the Hohokam primarily obtained old, dead shell by collecting it as beach drift, not through diving or dredging (Haury 1950:369, 1976:306-308). The Hohokam also pried fossilized shell from</page><page sequence="8">120 McGUIRE AND HOWARD Pleistocene marine deposits exposed along Adair Bay (Ferg 1980:375; Gifford 1946:215; Haury 1976:307). A widespread but sparse distribution of Hohokam pottery is found in small, ephemeral campsites along this coast (Gifford 1946:219-221; Haury 1976:306). Although little systematic archaeological research has been con- ducted in the area, no permanent villages or even large base camps have been reported along the investigated portions of the northern Gulf Coast. This shore was probably an undesirable place to linger, as the nearest potable water lies approximately 48 km away in the western Papagueria. Gladwin and others (1937) and Haury (1945, 1976) identified the genera and species used by the Hohokam and the types of artifacts produced. With only a few exceptions, the Hohokam primarily used items of shell as jewelry. These ornaments included bracelets, pendants, geometric, anthropomorphic, and zoomorphic cut shell motifs, rings, and various forms of beads and earrings. The Glycymeris bracelet was the most common type of jewelry at any time in the Hohokam sequence (Gladwin and others 1937; Haury 1945, 1976). In general, during all time periods, there is a considerable degree of functional and stylistic uniformity displayed in Hohokam shell artifacts (Haury 1976:305-321; Nelson 1981). THE TRINCHERAS SHELL INDUSTRY A closely related and nearby shell industry occurs in the Trincheras culture of northern Sonora, Mexico (Bowen n.d.; Johnson 1960, 1963). Large Trin- cheras sites are commonly covered with massive amounts of raw shell and debitage, and there can be little doubt that the prehistoric inhabitants of the area produced large numbers of shell ornaments. The finished artifacts on these sites, especially Glycymeris bracelets, vary little from finished Hohokam shell jewelry. The Trincheras shell worker, however, utilized a different technique of bracelet manufacture that produced a different pattern of debitage (Haury 1976:306; Woodward 1936:121). Considerable debate exists as to the relationship between Trincheras shell jewelry production and Hohokam shell exchange and use. Many early inves- tigators thought that the Trincheras culture provided the Hohokam with unfinished artifacts and unworked shell (Johnson 1960:188), and with most of their finished shell articles, particularly Glycymeris bracelets (Brand 1937:300, 1938:9; Sauer and Brand 1932:113-114; Woodward 1936:117). Research since the 1930s has shown that the Hohokam engaged in both the procurement of shell and the manufacture of shell jewelry. Bowen (n.d.:167) suggests that the Trincheras did not exchange shell with the Hohokam until the Classic period, when the Hohokam may no longer have had direct access to shell from the northern Gulf Coast. Support for this may be seen in a decrease both in the number of sites involved in shell production and in the amount of shell at sites in</page><page sequence="9">Hohokam Shell Exchange 121 the western Papagueria during the Sells phase of the Classic period (Howard 1983). On the other hand, Craig (1982) performed a bivariate regression analysis of shell at sites along the Santa Cruz River Valley and at the La Playa Site in northern Sonora and concluded that Colonial and Sedentary period shell along the Santa Cruz River most likely originated from the Trincheras area. Alterna- tively, the Hohokam centers in the Phoenix Basin may have also supplied shell to sites in the Tucson Basin (Doyel 1979). Regardless of the timing, the analysis by McGuire and Schiffer (1982) of shell distributions in the Papagueria further supports a Trincheras involvement in Santa Cruz River Valley exchange, as very little shell occurred in the eastern Papagueria, an area through which shell transfer from the Papagueria to the Santa Cruz River communities would probably have had to pass. Bowen (n.d.) and Craig (1982) believe that Hohokam-Trincheras interactions would have moved shell north up the Rio de Altar in Sonora, Mexico, to Santa Cruz River sites. Unfortunately, the debate concerning Trincheras involvement in Hohokam shell exchange continues and is difficult to resolve due to the paucity of data on this archaeological tradition. THE COLONIAL AND SEDENTARY PERIODS In our reconstruction, we have considered the Colonial and Sedentary periods together, because many of the early published site reports do not separate their shell assemblages by period. This collapsing of time periods also allows us to concentrate on the most marked change in the Hohokam sequence, the Sedentary to Classic period transition. In general, stylistic and taxonomic similarities are greatest between Colonial and Sedentary period shell as- semblages, with major changes in decorative motifs and genera used having occurred in the Classic period (Haury 1945:159; Howard n.d.a; Jernigan 1978:65; Vokes 1983:532). This does not mean that the organizational charac- teristics of the exchange network were static through both the Colonial and Sedentary periods. In fact, the picture that develops is probably most charac- teristic of the Colonial and early Sedentary periods, as it will be demonstrated that major changes in the distribution of shell production and exchange began in the middle and late Sedentary period. The Colonial-Sedentary Period Exchange Network By the Colonial period, the Hohokam material culture pattern was distributed over most of central and southern Arizona, and a network of shell exchange was firmly established. Doelle (1980, 1981) and others (McGuire and Mayro 1978; McGuire and Schiffer 1982; Rosenthal and others 1978; Teague 1981) have hypothesized that Hohokam in the western Papagueria gathered raw shells from the Gulf of California and returned to the Papagueria, where they</page><page sequence="10">122 McGUIRE AND HOWARD manufactured shell ornaments, particularly Glycymeris bracelets. The Papaguerians then traded both the finished jewelry and unworked shells into Gila Bend and the Phoenix Basin in return for agricultural products. In this sense, the shell trade may have acted as a "buffering mechanism" against periodic crop failure that occurred due to the unreliable precipitation in the Papagueria (Doelle 1980). In good seasons, exchanges of nonsubsistence goods probably maintained the network, in anticipation of future bad seasons (Doelle 1981:13). To support this argument, Teague (1981) has pointed out that the historic Pimans exchanged large quantities of subsistence goods through the same region (Russell 1908; Underhill 1939). Combining data from excavated village sites dating to the Colonial- Sedentary and Classic periods within the Gila Bend, Phoenix Basin, eastern Papagueria, and western Papagueria areas, McGuire and Schiffer (1982) performed a dummy-variable regression analysis in order to determine in which areas the greatest quantity of shell and the most manufacturing occurred. The results of these analyses suggested that the highest proportion of shell and the greatest incidence of manufacturing occurred in the western Papagueria. The proportion of shell and the intensity of manufacture were less in both the Gila Bend and Phoenix Basin regions, but did not significantly differ between these areas. The eastern Papagueria had very little shell in general and virtually no evidence of shell manufacture. The paucity of shell in the eastern Papagueria suggests that the region may have been either marginally, or totally, outside the network of exchange. McGuire and Schiffer (1982:249-252) conclude that the western Papa- gueria may have specialized in the procurement and production of shell for exchange with Hohokam populations in the Gila Bend and the Phoenix Basin regions. In an independent analysis based on a larger sample, Howard (1983, 1985) supports this finding. With the exception of the site of Snaketown (Haury 1976:321; Seymour 1985), sites in the Phoenix Basin dating to the Colonial- Sedentary period contained limited evidence of shell-ornament manufacture, but contained an abundance of finished shell artifacts (Howard 1983, 1985). The distribution of shell production activities does not appear to be the same within all of these regions. In the western Papagueria, shell manufactur- ing debris is ubiquitous, occurring in most village sites (Bostwick 1982; Huckell 1979; Masse 1980; McGuire and Mayro 1978; Raab 1974). These data suggest that shell manufacturing was not restricted to only a few villages or households in this area, but that a regional specialization in shell production existed. Within the Phoenix Basin during this period, unworked shell fragments and production debitage occur commonly in trash deposits at large sites (Haury 1976:321; Vokes 1983), and at least some of this debris results from the reworking of broken artifacts (Teague 1984:208). Evidence of actual manufac- turing loci where raw shell was processed into finished ornaments is found on</page><page sequence="11">Hohokam Shell Exchange 123 only six middle Sacaton phase house floors at Snaketown (Haury 1976:321; Seymour 1985; Seymour and Schiffer 1987). This concentration of production in a single center foreshadows the concentration of production in the succeeding Sacaton/Soho transition and Classic period. The Sedentary-Classic transition witnessed the appearance of Glycymeris bracelet production loci at two sites that had not previously been involved in shell manufacture. The floors of a late Sedentary pithouse at La Ciudad (Howard n.d.b.) and a transitional Sacaton-Soho pit house at Los Hornos (Howard n.d.c.) yielded in situ bracelet debitage, broken unfinished bands, shell abrasion dust, and shell-working tools. Beyond southern Arizona the boundaries of the shell exchange network are well defined to the west, east, and north of the Phoenix basin. The lack of archaeological data from Sonora prevents a clear boundary definition to the south. The Patayan tradition bounds the network on the west (McGuire and Schiffer 1982:216-272). It is possible that some of the Pacific Coast abalone (Haliotis) shells found in Colonial-Sedentary Hohokam sites may have origi- nated from this source, although very few Patayan sites along the lower Gila River have yielded Haliotis. There is, however, little other evidence of exchange with the Patayans, as only a handful of Hohokam sherds and no shell work clearly of Hohokam origin has been found in the lower Colorado River Valley during the time interval of the Colonial and Sedentary periods (Crown 1984; Schroeder 1952; Vivian 1965; Waters 1982). Vokes (1983:549-550) argues that the Pacific Coast genera most likely entered the Hohokam area through interactions with communities located north and west of Gila Bend and the Phoenix Basin. However, Haliotis and Pacific Coast Olivella in these northern sites tend to be most common in the very early periods (Archaic through Basketmaker II) (Colton 1941:318; Jernigan 1978:16). Yet Haliotis occurs in very small quantities on Hohokam sites throughout the Hohokam sequence, even into the Classic period. Thus, an alternative route of entry for abalone into the Hohokam area may have been through the regular southern trade network (Howard n.d.a.), as the ranges of most of the species of Haliotis found in Hohokam sites extend south along the west coast of Baja California (Morris 1966:52-53). This source is very close to the major collecting areas for Hohokam shell species along the northern Gulf of California and was probably inhabited by the same people that lived along the northwest coast of Sonora. It is possible that Haliotis transfer occurred along both northern and southern routes, however, and further research in both areas is needed to test the plausibility and timing of the two avenues of exchange. Hohokam shell artifacts commonly occur on sites east of the Phoenix Basin in the Tonto Basin (Haury 1932; Urban 1978) and as far east as the Mogollon site of Stove Canyon at Point of Pines (Neely 1974). The latter Mogollon village contains a Hohokam-style pithouse with a Hohokam artifact</page><page sequence="12">124 McGUIRE AND HOWARD assemblage. To the north, Hohokam shell occurs abundantly on sites in the middle Verde River (Breternitz 1960; McGuire 1977) and at Sinagua sites around Flagstaff. One Flagstaff site of this period, Winona Village, contains evidence of shell jewelry manufacture and a Hohokam-style pithouse (Fish, Pilles, and Fish 1980). The distribution of shell in sites at the northern and eastern edges of this network suggests the existence of a sharp, clearly definable boundary to the Colonial-Sendentary exchange system (compare Nelson 1981). Excavations by McGregor (1951, 1967) at over 23 Cohonino village sites, located northwest of Flagstaff and dating between A.D. 720 and 1080, recovered only three fragmen- tary Glycymeris bracelets. Plog (1979:128) notes that Panamic shell genera occurred only occasionally on western Anasazi sites north and east of the Little Colorado River. The Black Mesa Project excavated 12 Kayenta Anasazi sites dating from A.D. 500 to 1100 and recovered only six pieces of shell (Gumerman 1970; Ward 1976). New Mexico Mogollon sites also appear to be marginal to the exchange network during the Colonial period, but more fully integrated in the Sedentary period. In the Pine Lawn Valley, the Chicago Field Museum excavated over 10 sites dating prior to and during the Reserve phase (A.D. 900-1100). These sites yielded over 150,000 sherds but only 14 Glycymeris bracelet fragments and 90 shell beads (Bluhm 1957; Martin 1943; Martin and Rinaldo 1947, 1950a, 1050b; Martin and others 1943). This situation changed during the Tularosa phase with a marked increase in shell (Martin, Rinaldo, and Berter 1957; Martin and others 1956:107; Rinaldo 1959:262). A similar temporal pattern exists in the Hay Hollow Valley, where sites predating A.D. 1200 had little shell, whereas the Joint Site, which dates from ca. A.D. 1200 to 1250, had over 150 pieces of shell and contained evidence of shell-ornament production (Urban 1976). In the Mimbres region, hundreds of pieces of shell occur with Mimbres phase (A.D. 1000-1150) burials in large pueblos, but little shell is found in earlier, smaller villages (Bradfield 1931; Burns 1972; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932; Fewkes 1914; Laumbach 1976; Nelson, Rugge, and LeBlanc 1978; Nesbitt 1931). Only one analysis has addressed the issue of how shell exchange was organized in the exchange network that moved shell north from the Phoenix Basin. McGuire and Downum (1982) employed a falloff analysis to study the exchange of shell and Kayenta pottery in the Phoenix Basin to Flagstaff portion of the exchange system. Their analysis indicated that the distribution of Kayenta ceramics was exponentially related to distance from the source, leading the authors to conclude the Kayenta pottery was a utilitarian good exchanged in a down-the-line manner. The distribution of shell, however, did not correlate significantly with distance from the Phoenix Basin. Shell did correlate with increasing site size and thus, inferentially, with high-status</page><page sequence="13">Hohokam Shell Exchange 125 residence, leading the researchers to conclude that shell was a prestige good. Following Fish, Pilles, and Fish (1980), they postulated that the occurrence of a single Hohokam pit house at Winona Village could represent a Hohokam trade outpost among the Sinagua. McGuire and Downum (1982) further suggested that part- or full-time specialists associated with such outposts carried out the exchange in shell. These specialists were probably similar to historic Tewa traders who transported special commodities, such as textiles, on semi-regular rounds to villages as far away from the Rio Grande as those of the Hopi and Zuni (Ford 1972). The Meaning of Shell in the Colonial-Sedentary Period Because the Hohokam shell assemblage of these periods contained an extensive variety of forms, it is unlikely that all of these artifact types had the same meaning among regional Hohokam societies. The most common forms were shell bracelets, beads, and cut shell pendants, while less common were shell mosaics, etched shell, Pecten vogdesi pendants, painted shell, and Strombus trumpets (Nelson 1981:84). Our basic premise is that all of these forms were primitive valuables, that is, artifacts exchanged to legitimize social transactions such as marriages, rites of passage, and fines for offenses (compare Hodder 1982a; Schneider 1974; Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). We propose, however, that the first group of more common shell artifact types represents low value forms and the second group represents high value forms (compare Nelson 1981:84). Two alternative hypotheses are also viable. The first is Haury's (1976:321) hypothesis that shell did not relate to status but was simply personal ornamentation. The second hypothesis views shell as a primitive valuable, but considers all shell to have had equivalent value as prestige items. These postulates have different implications for the contexts of Hohokam shell and for the quantitative distribution of shell within those contexts. First, if the shell simply functioned as ornamentation, then intact shell artifacts should be common in de facto and primary refuse in household contexts, as it would simply reflect aesthetics and not have ritual or status meaning. We would also expect it to be uniformly distributed among all ages, ranks, and sexes in the population, because access to it would not be limited by cost or symbolic efficacy. On the other hand if all shell forms were of equal value as status-related goods, then shell should occur primarily in ritual contexts (that is, burials, caches, ballcourts, and so forth) and should be unequally distributed among individuals, households, or related groups of households. As Hodder (1982a:207) notes, ritual contexts are important indicators of goods that legitimize social transactions and support power, because the ritual association legitimizes the symbolic power of the good. Finally, if low value and high value forms existed, then some forms should be qualitatively more restricted in their distribution than others.</page><page sequence="14">126 McGUIRE AND HOWARD In dealing with the context of artifacts, it is very important that we take archaeological formation processes and refuse types into account (Schiffer 1976). We must consider whether the context of the artifact results from the behavior of the prehistoric inhabitants we study or from later cultural or natural disturbance processes. Different refuse types provide relevant information on the meaning of artifacts. De facto refuse and burials are the most desirable because the artifact is found in its context of use. Primary and secondary refuse deposits would contain objects either lost or discarded by the inhabitants of a site. Interpretation of meaning for artifacts from general fill contexts or from the surface of sites would have to be viewed with great caution, because distur- bance processes are likely to have played a large part in determining where these artifacts are recovered. Most finished, unbroken shell artifacts from Colonial-Sedentary period sites in the Phoenix Basin have been recovered from ritual contexts, principally from cremations and artifact caches. The 1934-1935 excavations at Snaketown recovered the majority of intact shell from cremations and the cremation (or "offeratory") mound in Block 6G (Gladwin and others 1937:95-96, 137-146). The 1964-1965 excavations made similar findings and also located large amounts of intact shell in one Sacaton phase artifact cache, Feature 2:95 (Haury 1976:182). At the Cashion Site, over 90 percent of the shell originated from 18 cremations and two inhumations (Urban 1981c:314- 319). The numerous Colonial and Sedentary period cremations found in cemetery areas at La Cuidad (Howard n.d.b.) contained whole Glycymeris bracelets, which had fragmented during burning, as their predominant shell grave good. Broken pieces of finished shell items occur commonly in second- ary refuse at both of these sites (see Nelson 1981), perhaps indicating that whole items had value but broken, incomplete ones did not. In addition, Colonial-Sedentary period shell is not evenly distributed in all burials. The 1934-1935 Snaketown excavations yielded over 500 cremations (age distribution unknown), 25 percent of which contained shell. The 1965 excavations recovered 110 cremations (10 children, 94 adults, 6 age unknown), with 20 percent of these containing shell (Haury 1976:320). Excavations at the Cashion Site recovered 611 of 664 finished artifacts from three adult burials (total burial population: 14 age unknown, 17 adults, 7 children) (Antieau 1981; Urban 1981 c:314-319). Thus, the distribution of shell in burials suggests that a differential in access to shell existed within Hohokam society. Just as shell is not distributed evenly within settlements, neither is it evenly distributed between settlements. Analysis of sites located between the Phoenix Basin and Flagstaff area (McGuire and Downum 1982) indicates a correlation between site size and the per capita frequency of shell (rho = .53, p = .01). Thus, during the Colonial-Sedentary period, certain individuals in large set- tlements may have been responsible for bringing shell into their sites and may also have had preferential access to the shell artifacts.</page><page sequence="15">Hohokam Shell Exchange 127 Figure 1.

Although it most certainly fulfilled this aesthetic function, it also appears to have been involved with social distinc- tions. The question remains whether or not all shell had the same value. There exists a group of possibly high value shell forms that have a qualitatively more restricted distribution than the more common bracelets, beads, and pendants. Etched shell, Pecten vogdesi pendants, Strombus trum- pets, shell mosaics, and painted shell occur infrequently in Colonial-Sedentary period sites, whereas literally thousands of beads and bracelets have been recovered. Only two trumpets (Gladwin and others 1937:147), fewer than 30 etched shells, and fewer than 10 pieces of painted shell (Nelson 1981:221, 223) have been reported from all Sedentary period sites. Although etched and painted shell occur most commonly as broken pieces in trash deposits, a few whole items have been found in cremations and caches (Nelson 1981:221, 223). The other hypothesized high-value forms of shell occur primarily within cremations and caches, including both of the Sedentary period Strombus trumpets from Snaketown (Boekelman 1936:27; Gladwin and others 1937:147), 99 percent of the shell mosaic pieces, and 90 percent of the P. vogdesi pendants (Nelson 1981:152, 214). Furthermore, the postulated high- value forms occur in only 10 pre-Classic Hohokam sites, half of which are in the Phoenix Basin (Nelson 1981:152, 214, 221, 223, 227). The differences in the distribution of the two groups of shell artifacts discussed here suggest that at least two levels of differential value existed for shell valuables within Hohokam societies (Figure 1). These observations on the value and meaning of Hohokam shell artifacts have been framed primarily with regard to the Phoenix Basin. It is unlikely that the meaning and value of these artifacts was the same throughout the Hohokam exchange network. There is only limited evidence for the use of shell jewelry during the Colonial-Sedentary periods within the western Papagueria region where it was produced (Doelle 1980, 1981; Ferg 1980; Howard 1983, 1985; Huckell 1979; McGuire and Mayro 1978; McGuire and Schiffer 1982; Rosen- thal and others 1978). Only 29 percent of the 1,452 pieces of shell recovered from four excavated Colonial-Sedentary settlements in the western Papagueria consisted of finished objects (McGuire and Schiffer 1982:246). It is likely that most of the shell artifacts produced in this region during this period were exported to Gila Bend and the Phoenix Basin (Howard 1983, 1985). It is possible that the production of shell jewelry for subsistence exchange purposes may have given shell objects a secular meaning and value in the region of their manufacture. Examples of shell jewelry production in Melanesia indicate that producers generally do not use the ornaments they make in status exchanges among themselves. Rather, the artifacts are used to acquire subsis- tence goods or other forms of valuables from groups that use the shell jewelry as valuables (Connell 1977). In general, among groups with a simple technology</page><page sequence="17">Hohokam Shell Exchange 129 and unrestricted access to raw materials, it is doubtful that the goods that they produce will become valuables within these groups. In the eastern Papagueria, the extremely scant occurrence of shell artifacts (McGuire and Schiffer 1982:247) also suggests that this region did not participate in the same system of meaning and value as did the Phoenix Basin. Several lines of evidence suggest that shell retained its meaning in the northern part of the network. The analysis of McGuire and Downum (1982) indicates that the frequency of shell does not decline with distance in this direction. Sites such as Winona Village in the Flagstaff area have propor- tionally as much shell as major sites in the Phoenix Basin. Shell is not the only product that occurs in Colonial-Sedentary period burials. Utilitarian objects including pottery, stone tools, and basketry are present, along with a large number of other objects apparently produced primarily for ritual or mortuary contexts. These artifacts include palettes, censors, carved stone bowls, obsidian projectile points, and carved bone. Along with a distinctive ceramic style, these are the primary markers of the Hohokam (Haury 1976). The forms and designs of Colonial-Sedentary period Hohokam ritual art share in a far broader system of symbols that extends into northwestern Mesoamerica and as far east as Chaco Canyon and the Mimbres and Casas Grandes areas (Haury 1976; Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner 1974; Wasley and Johnson 1965). Finally, a scattering of Mesoamerican goods including copper bells and iron pyrite mirrors is found in the same context as high value shell artifacts (Gladwin and others 1937; Haury 1976; Nelson 1981; Wasley and Johnson 1965). The higher value shell objects (with the exception of etched shell, which was uniquely Hohokam) may, along with copper bells and iron pyrite mirrors, have functioned only in exchanges among the highest status individuals over much of the Southwest (compare McGuire 1980; Plog, Upham, and Weigand 1982; Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). The copper bells and iron pyrite mirror tie into an even larger system of symbols extending throughout highland Mesoamerica. These goods may have legitimized the position of the highest status Hohokam individuals by their invocation of the more powerful cultures to the south. The actual objects physically linked the Hohokam elite in exchange relationships with the elite of northwestern Mesoamerica, and these ties provided the basis for Hohokam elite status. We can imagine that these exchanges would be linked to marriages, alliances, and gifts. Between A.D. 700 and 1150, Hohokam shell appears to have had a different meaning outside the Hohokam exchange network. In areas such as the Kayenta, no high value shell forms occur, and low value shell occurs too frequently to have been an important primitive value. In areas where low value Hohokam shell does occur in large quantities, such as at Chaco Canyon, it consistently accompanies the most elaborate elite burials (Akins and Schelberg 1981; Nelson 1981:136). This suggests that even hypothesized low value shell,</page><page sequence="18">130 McGUIRE AND HOWARD such as Glycymeris bracelets, moved into a high value sphere of exchange when it left the Hohokam exchange system. Such a change in value would explain why shell outside of the Hohokam exchange system occurs only in quantity at major villages, presumably associated with an elite. Summary of Colonial-Sedentary Shell Exchange Given recent research, it is possible to arrive at a plausible reconstruction of the organization of Colonial-Sedentary Hohokam shell exchange that is, in some ways, analogous to the operation of Melanesian exchange networks (Connell 1977; Hughes 1977). Hohokam inhabitants in the marginal agricul- tural environment of the western Papagueria procured shell from the Gulf of California and manufactured it into ornaments. The Papaguerian Hohokam then exchanged the ornaments and some raw and unworked shell to the Gila Bend and Phoenix Basin regions for food, providing a buffer for an unreliable Papaguerian subsistence base. Part- or full-time Hohokam specialists sub- sequently distributed the shell north of the Salt and Gila river basins throughout a bounded exchange system, establishing trade outposts at the periphery of the system among groups lacking a Hohokam material assemblage. This exchange was probably further linked to ceremonial activities involving ballcourts (compare Wilcox and Sternberg 1983), as ballcourts appear at both of the postulated trade outposts of Winona Village and Stove Canyon and also at the larger sites containing the greatest quantities of shell. Although the high status individuals in the exchange network were most likely the major clients, there is possible evidence for elite control of production only at Snaketown. Production was centered in the Papagueria, where there is no evidence of household specialization. Therefore, control over the produc- tion and exchange of Colonial-Sedentary period shell was not vested in the same center. The elites of the Phoenix Basin and at other large sites in the network may have controlled the exchange of high value shell items, but nothing suggests that they controlled production of the large quantities of low value shell artifacts, such as Glycymeris bracelets, that occurred in the Papagueria. Production loci for shell jewelry at Snaketown were apparently concen- trated in six middle Sedentary period houses. This may represent an early attempt by elites at the preeminent Hohokam village to gain control of shell jewelry production. If this was the case, then it marks the beginning of a shift that restructured shell exchange in the Classic period. THE CLASSIC PERIOD The composition and organization of the shell trade during the Classic period reflects the dramatic changes in the character and extent of the Hohokam</page><page sequence="19">Hohokam Shell Exchange 131 tradition that define this period. The variability and elaboration of shell jewelry decreased, but the actual amount of shell increased. Manufacture of shell ornaments, particularly Glycymeris bracelets, appeared at sites with platform mounds (Howard 1983, 1985), and there is reason to believe that the meaning and value of particular shell artifacts changed. Haury (1945, 1976) noted that, during the Classic period, Hohokam shell work became more standardized and less elaborate. Etched shell, carved bracelets, and many forms of zoomorphic motifs disappeared, while mosaic work, especially turquoise-on-shell, increased in frequency, and geometric designs became dominant. Bracelets remained the most common ornament form, but a wider style of band appeared that was less labor intensive in production and possibly more durable than the earlier, narrower forms. Despite the decline in elaboration, Haury (1945:159) maintained that there were more shells and more shell artifacts in the Classic period than in earlier times. Evaluating Haury's (1945:159) proposition that shell was more common in the Classic period requires control over the flow rates of shell. Numerous studies of Hohokam exchange have utilized the ratio of numbers of the traded item to numbers of sherds to establish the flow rates for these goods in prehistoric communites (Craig 1982; McGuire and Downum 1982; McGuire and Schiffer 1982; Teague 1984; Vokes 1983:583). Ideally, flow rate is a measure of the number of items entering a village in a given amount of time, divided by the number of people among whom these goods are distributed. Because they are standardized measures that are not dependent upon the scope of excavation, flow rates, unlike raw counts, make possible the intersite comparison of commodity distribution. Accurate computation of flow rates would require a complete knowledge of how long a village was occupied and how many people lived there in a given amount of time. At present, there is no way to measure directly these two parameters using archaeological data. We are thus forced to use indirect measures. This requires that we find archaeological materials whose frequency would be dependent on population size and duration, and against which frequencies of traded items could be compared. Researchers have considered several such measures for the Hohokam, including the number of pit houses, site area, number of recovered metates, and the number of recovered sherds. Of these possible indirect measures, only sherd counts are consistently and quantitatively available. The validity of a shell-to-sherd ratio as an estimator of prehistoric flow rates depends upon two assumptions: (1) holding site function constant, the amount of pottery deposited at a site reflects the population of the site and the length of time it was occupied, and (2) any recovery biases affecting the sample of shell recovered also affect, in a comparable manner, the total sample of sherds recovered.</page><page sequence="20">132 McGUIRE AND HOWARD Table 1.

(Note: Shell and sherd counts from Salt-Gila Aqueduct sites identified as transitional Sacaton-Soho excluded.) The amount of pottery deposited at a site should reflect the population of the site and the length of time it was occupied, if ceramics served similar functions in all of the sites considered. Most of the sites in this analysis were agriculturally-based habitation sites with excavated dwellings. Given the overall functional similarities among these sites, the total amount of pottery deposited at each should provide a rough indicator of its population and the duration of its occupation. Second, it seems that although differential recovery techniques might have affected the absolute frequencies of shell and pottery, these differences should not have affected the proportions of these items that were recovered. For example, screening should result in a higher recovery rate for both shell and sherds. These differences in recovery most certainly introduce some noise in our analysis, but this noise would only have the effect of weakening the relationships found. Table 1 compares sherd to shell ratios from the Colonial-Sedentary periods and the Classic period.

This trend is opposite in the Gila Bend region, as it may no longer have served the role of a "middleman" in transferring shell from the western Papagueria into the Phoenix Basin (Teague 1981). In order to establish if these changes were statistically significant, a two-sample T test (Table 2) and a Wilcoxian Rank Sum Test (Table 3) were used to compare each index between the Colonial-Sedentary and Classic periods in each region. For this analysis we averaged the indices for each site to arrive at a mean index for each period in each region. The shift in both indices was statistically significant only in the Phoenix Basin. Thus, we support Haury's (1945:159) position that the Phoenix Basin Hohokam had proportionately more shell and shell ornaments in the Classic period than they had in the preceding Colonial-Sedentary periods. The lack of significant results in the Gila Bend region and the western Papagueria may be a product of the small sample sizes involved. The Classic Period Shell Exchange Network One of the most important organizational changes in shell exchange is the intensification in shell production in regions where it had previously been of minor importance. Howard's (1983) analysis demonstrates that, during the Classic period, shell production ceased to be centered in the Papagueria and become more common in the Phoenix and Tucson basins. The western Papagueria continued to be a center of production, but the proportion of sites and the amount of shell involved declined (Howard 1983:88). The Gila Bend region underwent a settlement shift in the Classic period (Wasley and Johnson 1965), and Howard (1983) observed decreases in both the proportion of finished shell artifacts and in the quantities of shell in this region. At the same time, the proportion of local shell production, particularly of Glycymeris bracelets, increased, and Howard suggests that, for both the Gila Bend and</page><page sequence="22">134 McGUIRE AND HOWARD Table 3.

Papagueria 1.000 8 10 .363 .617 8 10 .533 *Snaketown included Papagueria regions, production was increasingly for intraregional use, and not for export to other areas such as the Phoenix Basin. Howard's analysis implies that a system of localized specialist manufac- turers during the Classic period replaced the earlier system of production that had been centered within the western Papagueria. This expansion of shell production is not limited to southern Arizona. Elsewhere in the old network, at villages such as Fitzmaurice and Tuzigoot, shell ornament production appears in the Classic period (Fish, Pilles, and Fish 1980; Nelson 1981:118). The widespread Colonial-Sedentary period Hohokam shell production and ex- change network broke down into smaller, more tightly bounded Classic period units, many of which were organized along major river valleys (Verde, Santa Cruz, Gila Bend, San Pedro) and within basins (Phoenix, Tonto, Tucson). Interregional shell trade continued, however, predominantly involving raw materials rather than finished artifacts (Howard 1983, 1985). This involution was, of course, not restricted to shell exchange but characterized Classic period society as a whole (Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). The widespread material culture pattern of the Hohokam became more diver- sified, with the Hohokam stylistic pattern being replaced outside the Phoenix Basin, Tucson Basin, and Papagueria by Sinagua, Salado, and Yuman material complexes. Earle (1982:8) and Spence (1982) argue that, with increasing inequality, specialists working for elite patrons come to control production of primitive valuables. Several Hohokam researchers suggest that stratification was greater during the Classic than in the previous periods of Hohokam prehistory (Wilcox and Shenk 1977; Wilcox and Sternberg 1981; McAllister 1976). A recent attempt to measure inequality in the prehistory of the Phoenix Basin also indicates slightly greater inequality in the Civano phase (McGuire 1983a). Thus, given the Classic period changes in the organization of shell production presented earlier, we hypothesize that elite social groups gained control of both the production and distribution of shell in the Classic period.</page><page sequence="23">Hohokam Shell Exchange 135 The indirect evidence of shell procurement and exchange in Sonora by the Trincheras suggests a possible new source of shell for the Hohokam during the Classic period (Bowen n.d.; Howard 1983). The Phoenix Basin Hohokam began to use increasing quantities of Panamic gastropods, for example, Conus, Nassarius, and Olivella, suggesting possible new sources and suppliers of shell during the Classic period (Howard n.d.a.; Vokes 1983). Such new procurers would have given the elite of the late Sedentary-early Classic period exchange network a new source of shell valuables in addition to finished goods from the western Papagueria. The concentration of large quantities of whole, unworked Olivella and Conus shells in Compound A at Casa Grande (Steen 1965:75) indicates an integral role for this site in the accumulation and distribution of these important Classic period genera (Howard n.d.a.). The Meaning of Shell in the Classic Period Although bracelets remained the dominant form of shell jewelry for the Classic period Hohokam, a shift in the meaning and value of shell appears to have occurred with the Sedentary-to-Classic transition. In addition to modifica- tions in style and decoration, such as increased stylization and standardization, changes also occurred in the contexts in which the shell was found. Intact bracelets may have remained a low value currency, but they are no longer the predominant grave good, as strands of gastropod and juvenile Glycymeris beads become common in Classic period inhumations (Howard n.d.a). During the Classic period within the Phoenix Basin, there appears to be a shift away from elite burials characterized by quantities of finely handcrafted valuables (Doyel 1980; Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). Shell is no longer strongly associated with high status burial and, indeed, occurs most commonly with infants and children. Haury (1945:154) observed a dearth of shell in more than 100 burials at Los Muertos. Of the 36 burials at the Escalante Ruin group, only two child burials yielded five shell beads between them (Doyel 1974). At Las Colinas, only four burials (two inhumations and two cremations) out of 21 (15 inhumations and six cremations) contained shell, and none of these yielded more than a few pieces (Hammack and Sullivan 1981:257). In the inhumation cemetery at Casa Buena, 29 of 57 inhumations contained shell, but most (72 percent) of these yielded five pieces or less (Howard n.d.a.). Concentrations of large quantities of shell ornaments and a diversity of ornament types occurred primarily within the individual infant and child burials at Casa Buena (Howard n.d.a.). A major transformation in all ritual paraphernalia of the Colonial- Sedentary period occurred during the Classic period, with forms such as palettes and figurines becoming less prevalent (Doyel 1980; Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). Etched shell essentially disappeared, whereas trumpets and turquoise-on-shell mosaics became more common. Both of the latter items</page><page sequence="24">136 McGUIRE AND HOWARD appear to have become ritual objects characterizing elite status throughout much of the Southwest (Boekelman 1936; Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner 1974; Gladwin and others 1937:147). Turquoise-on-shell mosaic incorporates two valuable commodities that do not occur together naturally but must be brought together through exchange. Mesoamerican goods became more common in many parts of the South- west in the Classic period, but became less common among the Hohokam (Schroeder 1965, 1966). The development of Casas Grandes as a major center apparently deprived the Hohokam of their unique access to Mesoamerican goods (McGuire 1980). Whereas before the Classic period copper bells, macaws, and iron pyrite mirrors were largely restricted to Hohokam sites and Chaco Canyon, during the Classic period, these items tend to occur at large sites throughout much of the Southwest (Hargrave 1970; McKusick 1974). The Southwest appears to have been linked by a network of elite exchange supported by a common set of elite symbols. The efficacy of these symbols derived in part from their origin or ideological connection to the more powerful cultures of Mesoamerica. Wilcox (n.d.) has recently proposed that, by the middle Classic period, the elites of the Hohokam, Salado, and Sinagua had constructed a series of military alliances cemented by elite intermarriage. He has postulated that in the Phoenix Basin an elite-controlled weaving industry was developed that supplied textiles for transfer in the wedding ceremony. He further argues that all of the exotic goods found in Classic period sites were transferred through these marriages. The transfer of items as wedding gifts is a common characteristic of non-western prestige or elite exchange systems (McGuire 1983b; Nelson 1981). Such exchange systems usually also involve the transfer of goods as gifts, sacred obligations, and fines for social transgressions. It is not clear if Wilcox includes the mass of shell bracelets, beads, and pendants as exotic goods. Literally thousands of these items have been recovered from Classic period sites, making it unlikely that they were transferred only through elite marriage. However, it does seem quite possible that the higher value goods such as Strombus trumpets and turquoise-on-shell mosaics may have been principally transferred in this manner. To summarize, the shifts in the value and meaning of Hohokam shell in the Classic period involved both internal and external changes. The interregional Hohokam exchange network of the Sedentary period, which was maintained in part by finely-made mortuary goods, including shell, was replaced by a number of smaller, more self-sufficient, bounded units that began producing the shell ornaments necessary for local use. These regional units were linked in a pan-Southwestern elite exchange network with a highly standarized set of status goods that may have had a common set of meanings derived from and linked to Mesoamerica. This Southwestern-Mesoamerican linkage was probably rein-</page><page sequence="25">Hohokam Shell Exchange 137 forced and maintained in part by the exchange of turquoise into Mesoamerica (Plog, Upham, and Weigand 1982). DISCUSSION We have argued that new data and analyses require a change in the way that Hohokam shell exchange is currently viewed. We have postulated that a regional specialization in shell production, particularly of Glycymeris bracelets, occurred in the Papagueria during the Colonial and Sedentary periods. The ornaments produced in the Papagueria were primarily exchanged to Hohokam populations in the Phoenix Basin and, to a lesser extent, through- out the rest of the Hohokam range. In the middle and late Sedentary period, a new pattern emerged as shell jewelry began to be produced in quantity in the Phoenix Basin. During the Classic period, this pattern of local production is intensified within all of the Hohokam regional systems and may have operated under the auspices of high status individuals who were responsible for obtaining access to new sources and suppliers of the raw shell from which Classic period ornaments were made. During both the pre-Classic and Classic periods, we do not view the transfer of shell as a simple economic relationship; Hohokam shell production and exchange were imbedded in social relations and may have been hierarchi- cally organized within Hohokam society. High and low value shell ornaments existed during all periods, with the high value artifacts serving to link local elites with those in different regions. The distribution of low value shell ornaments, such as Glycymeris bracelets, may have served to link elites and dependents within regions. Mechanisms involved in these linkages possibly included marriage exchanges, transfers at rites of passage, ritual exchanges, and payment of social fines or debts. We hope that our efforts have pointed to the necessity of considering shell exchange on an interregional scale and within the context of the broader social changes that occurred in Hohokam prehistory. The organization of Hohokam shell transactions can no longer be interpreted from the perspective of only one or a few sites. We hope that regionally-based empirical evaluations of our model will help clarify our reconstruction and will produce a reflection of the Hohokam past that integrates the regional settings of Hohokam interactions involving shell ornaments.
