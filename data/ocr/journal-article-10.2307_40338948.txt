John Martin Gillroy ABSTRACT: In this essay I will argue that, preconceptions notwith- standing, Immanuel Kant does have an environmental ethics which uniquely contributes to two current debates in the field. First, he tran- scends the controversy between individualistic and holistic approaches to nature with a theory that considers humanity in terms of the autonomy of moral individuals and nature in terms of the integrity of functional wholes. Second, he diminishes the gulf between Conservationism and Preser- vationism. He does this by constructing an ideal-regarding conception of the former that values nature not as "merely " a thing to be used by human preferences and translated by markets, but as an essential com- ponent and prerequisite to the intrinsic autonomy of human beings. Simultaneously, he argues for a definition of preservation which places responsibility on humanity to harmonize moral agency with the func- tional integrity of natural systems. Here humanity and nature become the two unique and equally important components of what we might call the greater "Kantian ecosystem. " In addition to the theoretical contributions of Kant's approach to our appreciation of the duties we owe to our natural environment, I will also suggest that Kantian Conservationism and Kantian Preservationism provide a sound moral basis for public policy arguments that wish to take the intrinsic value of humanity and nature into account. By requir- ing decision makers to consider citizens as ethical ends and nature as a functional end-in-itself, public choice becomes a process of restricting the use of the "kingdom of nature" to the essential requirements of the "kingdom of ends.

The market paradigm has dominated argument in pollution abatement and natural resource policy in the United States since their inception, and the principle of Kaldor efficiency with its focus on the instrumental value of nature, responsiveness to consumer preferences, and the maximization of net benefits over costs, has provided the conventional normative standards of public and professional discourse on environmental issues (Gillroy 1997, Part I). To the extent that we feel that the market paradigm has failed in its attempt to evaluate what is truly at stake in environmental decision making, we should search for new core principles, for a normative, nonefficiency standard that can, for example, effectively bring intrinsic value into the argument about environmental law and policy. The search for nonefficiency standards, though widespread, has been piecemeal and nonsystematic. Very little time has been taken to consider if established ethical philosophies might be employed as paradigms in the analysis and formulation of environmental law. For example, might there be established arguments for intrinsic value that could be adapted as paradigms for environmental policy argument? Although more than one ethical philosophy considers a definition of intrinsic value as a central issue (e.g., Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Habermas, Rawls), these efforts at moral and political theory have no specific environmental components. After all, most were written when human relations with the environment were marked by plenty rather than scarcity and when the idea that humanity could seri- ously affect nature was eclipsed by human fear of natural systems and their power over individual life. I will contend, however, that this shortcoming can be compen- sated for with the consideration and application of the normative principles in these theoretical arguments to the full range of policy issues, including environ- mental regulation. Specifically, this essay is an attempt to find such a nonefficiency paradigm in Kantian political thought and his concept of autonomy. I will argue that Kant's concept of autonomy ought to be considered as the core principle of environmental policy making because, unlike its market counterpart, it has the ability to define human duties to both humanity and nature which focus, not on their want-regard- ing instrumental value, but on their inherent or intrinsic worth.2 Examining Kant's philosophical system as a whole, I will address the issue that Kantian moral and political philosophy is anthropocentric and has no environ- mental ethic, especially one that considers nature for itself. I will then demonstrate that there are arguments for two sources of human duties to nature that exist within Kantian exegesis:3 one based upon our responsibility to conserve nature as human- ity's duty to itself (individually and collectively), and another focused on our obli-</page><page sequence="3">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 33 gation to preserve natural functioning for its own sake, as humanity's duty to the highest good (Kant C3, 450) and the harmony between the realm of nature and the realm of ends considered as a whole biosphere made up of ecosystems.4 Although the first of these justifications for our duty to nature values the envi- ronment as it is instrumental to humanity, I will contend that Kant's definition of "instrumental," and what ends justify the "instrumental" use of nature, is unique and unconventional. For Kant, our instrumental duty to nature is brought about by our intrinsic duty to ourselves and is neither consequentialist nor want-regarding. Rather, it is concerned with the moral ideal of autonomy which requires a sound environment and regulated use of resources, as it requires justice, for the essential needs of all generations of human beings. The second argument attributes a human duty to nature as a distinct component (with humanity) of ecosystems5 as wholes. Ecosystems, are defined by Kant as the interface between human and natural sys- tems as these make up the whole biosphere or world system.6 Here our duty is to the intrinsic value of nature as a functional entity that has a capacity, ability, and purpose of its own, which has created us and of which we are the highest expres- sion (Beck 1960, 161). From within Kantian philosophy I will contend that humanity, being the most prominent moral and strategically rational species on the planet, has duties to nature not only as the environment affects human moral agency or autonomy but also in terms of nature's existence as a functional end-in-itself. However, I shall maintain that human consideration of autonomy and its moral demands on how one conducts individual and collective/political life generates environmental pol- icy which not only conserves nature as it essentially affects humanity but also pre- serves evolving natural systems, functioning independently of human concern. With a definition of the Kantian world system and its component ecosystems, containing human and natural systems as these interface and create a biosphere compatible with the demands of the moral law, we shall have a nonmarket stan- dard upon which to build alternative public policy arguments. This model will define a just environmental policy as one that equally considers the intrinsic requirements of both humanity and nature; that is, what autonomous choice demands of the moral agent in dealing with environmental media and species as well as with one another. This reorientation may help to recast collective discourse and decision making on environmental matters. KANTIAN CONSERVATIONS*/! There are many diverse schools of thought within environ- mental ethics (Zimmerman et al. 1993; Devall and Sessions 1985; Taylor 1986; Norton 1987; Johnson 1991; Nash 1989; Goodpaster and Sayre 1979; Elliot and Gare 1983).7 These approaches offer a variety of standards and ends for human ethical deliberation that grant either individual animals, plants, and/or natural sys- tems and the biosphere, varying degrees of moral standing. Whatever the moral</page><page sequence="4">1 34 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 argument, however, humanity cannot help but play a central role, at least in the vocabulary and agency of moral choice. It is the human being that has the technological capacity, is the agent of wide- spread and intergenerational change and "matters" more than any other single spe- cies in whether or not life persists and in what form. We are not worried that beavers will destroy a forest, or that fish will over contaminate a water supply. What humanity does is, and ought to be, our primary "environmental" concern. On the positive side, it is also the human being, alone, that has the moral capacity to understand not only what is but what ought to be, and act to achieve it. We are moral agents, nature is not, and therefore, it is our actions, our technology, and the control of these by our sense of duty to ourselves and to the environment that will determine our public policy and our own and nature's condition, now and in the future. These duties will define our environmental policy. While some argue for the interests (Singer 1980; Johnson 1991) or rights (Regan 1980) of nature and its components, these arguments are an effort to create nature in our own image with our own moral attributes and not only fail to take nature on its own terms but create a second-order moral class that is more remote and foreign than humanity and its moral responsibilities. The question is whether, by extending the human concepts of interests and rights to nature, we simulta- neously extend the concept too far where it has no moral purchase or power in pol- icy argument (Norton 1987; Hargrove 1992). While we argue about the "rights" of animals, species fail to thrive. While we argue about the spiritual character of old growth forests, they are clear-cut. The rights, interests, or demands of nature simply do not matter if humanity feels no duty to respect those demands. Ethics is a human attribute and it is the predisposi- tions of our practical reason, as we apply moral imperative to action, that will cre- ate our view of the world and our definition of responsibilities to ourselves and the natural world. In the end, if humanity does not perceive that nature is vital, either in itself (on its own terms) or to the ends of persons, the necessary respect, reflected by a policy of protection and/or conservation, will not be forthcoming and environmental "rights" are moot. Overall one can imagine humanity having one of three relationships with nature: 1) we can argue that humans are simply another species in the natural order of things that must stay within the confines of natural processes to survive; 2) we can contend that humanity is a superior species, unequal and with no requirements of justice binding us to respect natural systems; or 3) one may posit that while humanity is 6&gt;/nature, we are also transcendent in terms of our moral capacities and able to imprint and reshape both our own character and nature' s in accordance with human agency as regulated by moral principle. Since I wish to approach the moral status of nature from the vantage point of intrinsic value, or autonomy of the human individual in Kant's moral philosophy, this commits me to the third model.8 When the basis of justice is the intrinsic value</page><page sequence="5">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 35 of humanity in the person, then the pertinent question is: how does human auton- omy invoke duties to nature? A superficial reading of Kantian philosophy, as it regards nature and natural systems, begins with the contention that Kant is an anthropocentric or human-cen- tered "rationalist" with an ethics that grants intrinsic moral value only to humanity (Attfield 1983, 20-33). The argument is that only humans are "moral" ends-in- themselves (Kant GW, 427-29) and, therefore, we are the only intrinsically valu- able life form. All other living systems exist to instrumentally support humanity in its search for moral perfection. Our duties toward animals are merely indirect duties toward humanity. (Kant LE, 239) If a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of service, he does not fail his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot judge, but his act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity which it is his duty to show toward mankind. (Kant LE, 240) What is assumed about Kantian environmental ethics is essentially true, but it should not follow that an environmental ethic therefore does not exist, or that it grants no intrinsic value to nature. It is correct that Kant ascribes ethics to human- ity alone. This is logical, for mankind is the only species whose capacity, ability, and purpose have "moral" content which allows him to "judge" and act ethically. Kant is then, as all moralists are, anthropogenic in taking a human, that is, an eth- ical point of view where we are the moral agents. Only humans are ethical ends- in-themselves with the capacity to recognize their duty, and the ability to take on obligations and perform them purposively, to create a just world. Kant's concern is the distinction between the realm of ends and the realm of nature. The former is the world of human systems where individuals count because they are the focus of intrinsic value. The latter is the world of natural systems where intrinsic value is concerned with functional wholes which are the units of evolution and the focus of human duty. The individual animal or tree has func- tional value only as part of a greater system and not in and of itself. This is why Kant states that our duties to individual animals can only be a duty to oneself. By discounting individual creatures, however, Kant does not simultaneously discount nature and its functional systems as having intrinsic value. The human moral purpose is in perfecting one's freedom or autonomy in order to take a higher-level control over one's life. It is within the definition of human intrinsic value to attach concepts like duty, right and justice to human conduct.9 The second point, however, that is incorrectly drawn out of the first, is that due to this moral distinction, all other species and natural systems are outside the pale of moral duty for humanity and can be used by mankind, at will, as instrumental val- ues to supply his wants (Singer 1980, 231-32; Regan 1980). The important distinc- tion here is between being inherently moral and being the subject of moral duty for those who are. While nature can never be the former, this does not disqualify it from being the latter.</page><page sequence="6">1 36 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 As the argument goes, with "personhood" (McCloskey 1983, 59), the domi- nant force in ethics, "Everything other than a person can only have value for a per- son. . .if x is valuable and not a person, then x will have value for some individual other than itself (Vlastos 1962, 48-49). It is concluded, therefore, that any moral argument (including Kant's) that is based on the "dignity" or "intrinsic value of man" (Frankena 1962, 23) is antithetical to any environmental ethic that wishes to attribute a distinct and intrinsic value to the natural ecology and its component parts (Goodpaster 1979, 26-28). Kant, although he grants no inherent "moral" sta- tus to nature, never recommends waste, exploitation, or cruelty to the natural world considered as a system (Kant MM, 442-44). These are all immoral acts which are against our ethical duties to ourselves and others.10 One can argue that nature is still only "instrumental" to human ends within this reading of Kant, and that would be true, but Kant's is an unconventional use of the term instrumental and is con- cerned with more than the mere use of nature to increase human utility. For Kant, even if natural systems do not have intrinsic value, (which I will shortly argue that they do) but only instrumental value, this would still not allow humanity to treat nature and its components merely as a means to any and all of their subjective preferences. Kant's individual is required to function within the categorical imperative and has ethical duties to herself that concern both her ani- mal nature and her character as a moral being (Kant MM, 420). It is within one's duties to these dimensions of human character that permissible and nonpermissible uses of nature would be defined within Kantian Conservationism. When nature is "instrumental" to one's perfection and preservation, as an autonomous moral agent, then one's relationship with nature is not want-regarding but ideal-regarding (Barry 1990) and predicated on the role resources play in empowering one's autonomy. Here it is the reinforcing and "transformative value" of nature (Norton 1987, 188-91) that is critical. Nature plays a role in reinforcing humanity's value through empowering one's capacity to see beauty, show kindness and consideration, and act justly. When one acts so as to treat nature with respect, the use of practical reason in its application to the person is honed. In addition, nature empowers the autonomy of the individ- ual by transforming one's preferences to those more compatible with the moral law. If we believe... that experience of nature is a necessary condition for developing a consistent and ratio- nal world view, one that fully recognizes man's place as a highly evolved animal whose existence depends upon other species and functioning ecosystems, they also believe that such experiences have transformative value. Experience of nature can promote questioning and rejection of overly materialistic and consumptive felt preferences. (Norton 1987, 189) Instrumental use, from a Kantian point of view, is not consequentialist but nonconsequentialist and finds its moral value in the maxims which recognize one's joint duty to seek excellence in oneself and justice for society.</page><page sequence="7">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 37 [U]nresponsiveness to what is beautiful, awesome, dainty, dumpy, and otherwise aes- thetically interesting in nature probably reflects a lack of the openness of mind and spirit necessary to appreciate the best in human beings. (Hill 1991, 116) The watchword is duty to one's baseline capacity, ability, and purpose and the role that nature plays in preserving and perfecting the human being (Gillroy 1997). From the standpoint of one's physical or animal being and its perfection, the use of resources must be within the moral law. We are not concerned with human preference, economic efficiency, or one's happiness considered as higher levels of utility but with the empowerment of moral autonomy. In addition, the use of resources must be planned from a timeless and nonrelative standpoint as all gener- ations of humanity, all over the world, will require a similar resource base to pre- serve themselves and their opportunity to perfect their autonomy. Therefore, the imperative is to conserve resources with one's duty to justice as autonomy in mind. Waste and abuse are immoral and the long-term empowerment of moral agents both now and in the future must regulate humanity's designation and use of nature as a resource. Within a political or policy framework, it is the role of nature in fulfilling human private and public right, that requires humanity to treat nature through jus- tice. It is the formation of a just state that Kant suggests will produce the necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for the realization of the realm of ends, and these conditions include a sound and evolving natural world that provides the physical setting for human moral and political advancement. As justice provides the base- line distribution of freedom, property, and opportunity, nature provides a sound and thriving environment to bring out the best in humanity (Gillroy 1997). 12 With the human consciousness of our role in nature evolves a further appreciation of the independent value of nature as an equal component in the "system of the whole earth," and here, with this realization, we have the essential conditions for the cre- ation of Kant's kingdom of ends. [A]s we become more and more aware that we are parts of the larger whole we come to value the whole independently of its effects on ourselves. (Hill 1991, 111) It is in the creation of a just political world and its reconciliation with the nat- ural world, that we find the roots for more than an evaluation of nature as it is instrumental to humanity. Kant did not write of the kingdom of ends as the sole consideration of human moral choice, he also writes of a preexisting kingdom of nature and the harmony of the realm of ends with the realm of nature as necessary to effectuate the "highest good" of the human condition. It is here where the unconventional argument for humanity's instrumental use of nature evolves into an argument for human duty to the intrinsic value of nature as an independent ele- ment in the greater whole of human experience and moral ends. Yet the opposition between nature and culture is to be finally overcome in the creation of "the perfect civil constitution" that would mark the end of political history, creating</page><page sequence="8">1 38 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 a new harmony between reason and nature by reshaping the latter in view of the former. (Yovel 1980, 193) KANTIAN PRESERVATIONIST! When we posit that human autonomy requires the environ- ment to sustain and perfect our agency, we must also remember that, for Kant, the realm of nature lives independently of us and is our progenitor (Kant Cl ; C3, 427; Zammito 1992, 342). Nature produced humanity, but now that humanity has mor- ally transcended nature we have separated ourselves from the complete control of nature. We are agent causes within a functionally causal world. But what about our duties to nature after human transcendence? The first thing we need to understand is that inherent or intrinsic value has more than one definition. The intrinsic value of nature is different from the intrin- sic value of humanity. Humanity is of inherent value in terms of its unique moral capacity while nature is of inherent value in terms of its causality and systemic functioning. We can argue about whether nature has rights, but not with the asser- tion that it is a self-generating, functional system with the capacity for independent evolution. It is here, in its function, that nature is an end-in-itself. It is within the teleology of natural systems causality and evolution that nature has value, not only to humanity but independent of us.13 Darwin explained the teleological character of the living world non-teleologically. The evolutionary process is not itself teleological, but it gives rise to functionally organized [natural] systems and intentional agents. (DLH in Audi 1995, 791) I have argued that Kant's concept of the individual person as an ethical end-in- herself, as having intrinsic value, is defined by the ethical capacity, ability, and purpose of the human being (Kant C2; GW). Our human moral capacity, and how it is empowered by our ability and defined by our purpose as people, gives us inherent worth. Within this same framework, I will now argue that, where humans have a particular capacity, ability, and purpose that grants them moral autonomy or integrity, natural systems exhibit a distinct capacity, ability, and purpose (Kant C3, 373-75) that grants them a functional autonomy or integrity,14 an intrinsic value and, therefore, independent ethical standing in human policy decision making. A unique element of this Kantian argument is that valuing nature as a func- tional system not only grants it intrinsic value status, but defines intrinsic value not in human terms (rights, interests, etc.) but uniquely in terms of the specific physi- cal, chemical, and biological characteristics of nature, making the Kantian approach neither anthropocentric nor anthropomorphic.15 Human beings are moral creatures. Kant suggested that humans have one foot in the material world and one in the spiritual (Kant RL, BKII, §1). This existence between the material and the spiritual gives human beings a moral quality and this moral dimension places requirements upon individual will and choice in our deal-</page><page sequence="9">Kantian Ethics and Environmentai Policy Argument 1 39 ings with the material world (Yaffe 1995). The substance of the human "moral quality" is evaluation: the predisposition to place value on entities and make this evaluation the basis of our relationship with that entity. All valuing (produced through maxims) is human and all moral worth is a product of human deliberation and argument. Morality is measured in terms of duty and only humans can have or be responsible to moral duties. Therefore, only those persons and things that invoke moral duty will count in human deliberation and ethical choice. The moral realm is a human realm but that does not mean that humans are the only subjects of moral duty, or that valuation must transmit human ethical characteristics to non- human life (e.g., rights). If one pushes past the surface of what Kant says about the duties to nonhuman forms of life (Kant MJ, 239-41; MV 443-44), and examines the essential logic of his structural argument about intrinsic value, there is a Kantian justification for humanity's relationship to natural systems that is based on the intrinsic value of those systems, not as moral but as functional ends-in-themselves in the greater world system. The realm of nature and the realm of ends exist as parallel and interconnected systems of life, each dependent upon the other for persistence.16 The duty of humanity is to establish harmony between these realms and to find coordination and perfection in their common evolution (Kant C3). Here, one can utilize Kant's concepts of teleology and the "highest good" to their best results. Let us therefore examine three dimensions of the inherent value of nature within the Kantian scheme: 1. the definition of the world system, 2. how nature gets a moral value for its functional purpose, and finally, 3. what specific duty humanity owes to nature in-and-of-itself. 1 . The World System Defined Kant states that "[t]he world can be regarded as a universal system of all ends, whether through nature or through freedom" (Kant LT, 143). The world is the combination or "complex of all natural beings" (Kant OP, 22:59), which are so in relation to one another that they form an evolving and interdepen- dent whole of organic life. First, we must define an organic body as Kant does: An organic body is one in which each part, with its moving force, necessarily relates to the whole (to each part in its composition). The productive force in this unity is life. This vital principle can be applied a priori, from consideration of their mutual needs, to plants, to animals, to their relation to one another taken as a whole, and finally, to the totality of the world. (Kant OP, 21:211) Then, we need to see these organic entities as connected and evolving, even beyond this planet. That its organizing force has so arranged for one another the totality of the species of plants and animals, that they, together, as members of a chain, form a circle (man not excepted). That they require each other for their existence, not merely in respect to their</page><page sequence="10">140 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1998 nominal character, but (similarly) their real character (causality) - which points in the direction of a world organization (to unknown ends) of the galaxy itself. (Kant OP, 22:549 [fn]) Within this world system there are two realms: the realm of causality which is nature, and the realm of ends which involves human moral perfection. The former pre-existed and created the latter but the latter has the power to effect the ongoing internal progress and evolution of natural causality. In effect, the strategic and moral rationality of humanity, moving toward a realm of ends, has the power to disrupt, alter, and reshape the course of the realm of nature. However, without the perfection of the realm of nature, the human condition cannot achieve ultimate value and therefore our "reshaping"17 of nature must func- tion under moral imperatives that impose duties upon us in terms of the functional capacity, ability, and purpose of nature if we are to achieve not only the realm of ends18 but the "highest good" of both physical and spiritual perfection. "In the highest good the moral good and the natural good are combined according with the rule of worthiness to form the entire good of moral man" (Yovel 1980, 57). We are special within nature but this does not give us privilege but responsibility to the whole and its joint perfection. The physical perfection of the world is the system of all ends in accordance with the nature of things; and is attained along with the rational creature's worthiness to be happy. It is only in this way that the state of a creature may obtain a preeminent value. Without such a physical perfection of the world, the rational creature might certainly have an excellent value in himself, but his state could still be bad; and vice versa. But if both moral and physical perfection are combined, then we have the best world. (Kant LT, 140-41) If the "best world" is one where nature and humanity are in harmony, and each is considered to be an independent component with equal value both in themselves and as parts of a greater whole, then any moral imperative to conserve nature and/ or preserve its functional integrity, as we empower our own autonomy, must be considered within a Kantian model of ecosystems. Unlike the scientific definition of ecosystem (Odum 1975) which tends to underplay the human role and focus on the systemic connections between organic and inorganic natural entities, for Kant, the ecosystem is both an actual physical interface between humanity and nature and a metaphysical possibility of human- natural systems coordination. Ecosystems can be considered to be made up of two major components, the sphere of humanity, with its morality, technology, and socio-political organiza- tion, and functional nature. Therefore, it is the interface between human biota and abiota and natural biota and abiota that is of interest to justice and political theory and becomes the point of practical application for human duty to nature. In addi- tion, the metaphysical goal of perfection and harmony creates an end for ecosys- tems and the ultimate justification for human ethics. Before we examine the duties</page><page sequence="11">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 41 humanity has to recognize and maintain the intrinsic value of nature, we must first proceed from nature's functional value in an ecosystem to its moral weight as a subject of ethical value in and of itself. It is to the human evaluation of nature's inherent integrity that we now turn. 2. The Intrinsic Value of Nature The idea of the harmony of the world system is connected with Kant's concept of the "highest good" of that system. The "highest good" is more fundamentally connected to both the purpose of man and the purpose of nature.19 Here the highest good is "the union of the purposiveness arising from freedom with the purposiveness of nature" (Kant RL, 1st. Preface) and it is the causal characteristics of nature, as harmonized with the deontological character of humanity, that sets the standard by which humanity ought to value both itself and nature. The point of departure for a theory of value is the basis upon which that value is judged. For humanity, the dignity of the individual is a function of the integrity of moral capacity, ability, and purpose: specifically, one's internal capacity to will in line with the moral law; one's ability to express moral predisposition in external agency; and one's purpose in perfecting internal autonomy in external moral agency and political justice (Kant GW; MV). Willing the categorical imperative (Kant GW, 419-20) is, for Kant, the basis of all moral (intrinsic) value, for human- ity has dignity, according to Kant, only "so far as it is capable of morality" (Kant GW, 435; Yaffe 1995). It is in the Realm of Ends that Kant makes the distinction between dignity and price (Kant GW, 435-36), for it is only here that the motiva- tion of each person is moral. In a Realm of Ends (Kant GW, 433-39), where all have fulfilled their purpose, becoming fully articulate moral agents, each person's capacity, ability, and purpose grants them a good will, (Kant GW, 393) and there- fore, moral dignity as individuals within just societies. This is not to say that each person ought not always treat others with respect as having intrinsic value, but that dignity is something that an individual earns by submitting one's will to the moral law and expressing this will through one's choices in the material world. Civil law, through justice, has the mandate to empower each person's capacity for autonomy, protect their ability to choose mor- ally in the material world, and seek their potential (purpose) as moral agents able to reason practically in civil discourse (Kant MJ, 3 1 If.). This defines human intrin- sic value. A natural system also has its own capacity, ability, and potential as part of the world of cause, effect, and natural selection. Nature pre-dates us and has created the possibility of humanity and its future realm of ends. In this way, the realm of ends is built upon the model of the realm of nature (Paton 1948, 190-191). Nature's subsystems are characterized by their dynamic evolution and their intricate web of cycles, energy, and material flows (Golley 1993; Pimm 1991; O'Neill et al. 1986). The mutualism of species and the interdependent subsystems</page><page sequence="12">1 42 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 of nature find their capacity in causality, their ability in natural selection, and their purpose or potential in evolving toward different moments of complexity and homeostasis (Abrahamson and Weis 1997; Williams 1966; Mayr 1976). The unique character of a natural system, to reach various points of change, is depen- dent upon its functional integrity remaining intact (Pimm 1991; Brooks and Wiley 1988). A natural system, therefore, is a functional whole, a well-balanced, dynamic, and evolving entity (Abrahamson and Weis 1997; Von Schilcher and Tennant 1984), that is a functional end-in-itself. It is an end for itself, and for us, because it has an internal dynamic and intrinsic value that is distinct and worthy of moral respect independent of its uses by humanity (Kant C3, 380; MM, 443). But how can this functional value have moral impact as a human duty? Nature has no inherent morality, only causality. Humanity, in order to synthe- size its moral half with its natural half, reflectively imputes nature with a supersen- suous quality, with a teleology of natural purpose (Kant C3, §§82-84; Paton 1948, 149). This teleology provides a bridge between the moral and the functional sphere where humanity is the ultimate expression of functionality in nature and with the harmony of the moral and the natural as the "highest good" of the world system. Here, human duty finds voice, both in terms of responsibilities to oneself and to the whole. The duty to the whole implies a duty to nature as the functional prerequisite of total harmony. We must use nature to achieve our perfection and persistence but, as we ought not use other humans as mere means but simultaneously as moral means and ends, so to achieve harmony, we must recognize the unique realm that is nature and preserve its functionality as a prerequisite to our use and conserva- tion. Only in this way can we achieve our moral goals within the limits of the demands of the moral law. As all things in nature are mutual means and ends of one another, so we must never consider nature as merely a means, but always simultaneously as a functional end-in-itself and, as such, of moral value indepen- dent of humanity as a separate component in the ecosystem and greater biosphere. The goal of Kant's ecosystem is "unity and harmony" which motivates us against "destroying all order in nature" (Kant LT, 157). Kant defines integrity as "not the opposite of depravity (perversity) but of loss (as of a limb) and of imper- fection by deprivation" (Kant OP, 21 :37). Both humanity, through the "freedom of man," and nature, through "Newtonian attraction through empty space," are said to be "categorical imperatives" (Kant OP, 21:35; Yaffe 1995) and nature, as human- ity itself, is said to have a "soul" (Kant OP, 22:418; also 21:18; Zammito 1992, 304-5). Here nature finds a unique capacity, ability, and purpose, or an integrity that ought not be "deprived" in the interplay of means and ends through human calculation and choice (either public or private). The idea of organic bodies is indirectly contained a priori in that of a composite of mov- ing forces, in which the concept of a real whole necessarily precedes that of its parts, which can only be thought by the concept of a combination according to purpose. (Kant OP 21:213)</page><page sequence="13">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 43 Nature has inherent value in seeking its own ends. The system of natural law that is our environment is a fitting model for human moral law and also a teleological standard for human judgments of both the ultimate ends of nature and of humanity. The realm of natural law is essential to the formulation of human categorical imperatives and is, in this way, the basis for one's moral deliberations. [T]he system of natural laws applying to dogs and cats as well as human beings is to be understood as defining a teleological system - one in which events occur for the sake of realizing natural ends. In conceiving of nature this way we are imposing a rational order on it; we are conceiving of it as a fundamentally rational system. As so conceived, the formal structure of natural laws is not just analogous to the formal structure of ratio- nal laws: the formal structure is the same in both cases. Given this, the system of nature is necessarily an adequate model for a system of rational wills. (Aune 1979, 59-60) Nature is that nonmoral purpose which created humanity (Zammito 1992, 327). Inherently, this is a functional value, but in relation to the origin and persis- tence of humanity as an end-in-itself, the human duty to its creator, and the persis- tence of the whole ecosystem, it is an intrinsic moral value (Kant C3, 427). Therefore, the functional integrity of natural systems has standing as an end-in- itself, as necessary in-and-of-itself, and independent of any elective ends humanity might have. Humanity alone can recognize and execute duty to that which has intrinsic value. Human duty in regard to the environment is to respect and preserve nature's functional integrity as an evolutionary and homeostatic end-in-itself, nec- essary to the realization of the "highest good." The highest good is always conceived as a harmony of heterogeneous systems, where exact correspondence between the different constituents (. . .freedom and nature in gen- eral) takes place by the autonomous laws of each system itself. (Yovel 1980, 66) 3. One's Duty to Preserve Nature's Intrinsic Value The highest good is no longer a separate, transcendent world, but becomes the consum- mate state of this world, to be realized through a concrete development in time.. . .The progressive power of history is ascribed not only to a hidden "cunning of nature," but also to the conscious work of practical reason. . .the concept of happiness loses its cen- tral position and is replaced by nature in general as the empirical component of the highest good. (Yovel 1980, 30-31) The intrinsic value of nature invokes a duty that humanity not exploit the nat- ural environment for personal happiness, and directs the regulation of human behavior toward the end of the harmony of humanity and nature as two distinct but equal entities, in a world system that it is the duty of humanity to create as the "highest good" of our efforts. Within this greater system, the realm of ends and the realm of nature are reshaped by the moral capacities of humanity with the under- standing that each component of the greater whole has its own unique intrinsic value and role in mutual evolution.</page><page sequence="14">1 44 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 But if he is conscious of following his duty, then man is certain of being a member or link in the chain of the kingdom of ends. This thought gives him comfort and reassur- ance. It makes him inwardly noble and worthy of happiness. And it raises him to the hope that he may constitute a whole together with all other rational beings in the king- dom of morals, in just the same way that everything is connected and unified in the kingdom of nature. (Kant LT, 41) Humanity comes from nature but moves beyond it in terms of moral capacities and the ability to reason strategically (Kant Cl; C2; C3; MM; Elster 1979). There- fore, even when Kant states that human duties to animals and nature are indirectly duties to humanity, he is not discounting nature but reaffirming that our moral value, our duties to nature, are indirectly to ourselves as the sole products of nature capable of morality ("the dog cannot judge"). This means that, as our deontologi- cal purpose toward moral agency grows from the teleological and causal purposes of nature, this "moral product" builds a moral intrinsic value from a pre-existing functional one. Kant's argument leads to a unity of man and nature where both humans and the natural systems in which they evolve can be said to have interde- pendent, albeit distinct, intrinsic values (Kant C3, 429-35). Only humans create or owe moral duties, but the principle of this duty, its necessity to the moral perfection of humanity, applies not only to humans as an ethical end, but also to nature as a functional or causal end-in-itself as equal com- ponents in the world system that is Kant's definition of the "highest good." Moral- ity is a transcendent quality of nature; it cannot be of mere instrumental value if it created that which has intrinsic moral capabilities.21 [O]nce we have discovered that nature is able to make products that can be thought of only in terms of the concept of final causes, we are then entitled to go further; we may thereupon judge products as belonging to a system of purposes even if they (or the rela- tion between them, though purposive) do not require us to account for their possibility, to look for a different principle beyond the mechanism of blind efficient causes. For the idea of nature as a system of nature already leads us, as concerns its basis, beyond the world of sense, so that the unity of the supersensible principle must be considered valid not merely for certain species of natural beings, but just as much for the whole of nature as a system. (Kant C3, 380-81) In the same way that humans have a deontological moral purpose in practical reason and moral agency, natural systems can be said to have a teleological pur- pose in their functional integrity and evolution. This is the same functional evolu- tion that produced humanity as its highest teleological purpose. [J]udging man. . .to be not merely a natural purpose, which we may judge all organized beings to be, but also to be the ultimate purpose of nature here on earth, the purpose by reference to which all other natural things constitute a system of purposes. (Kant C3, 230) Under these circumstances practical reason ought to recognize that the unique capacity, ability, and potential of nature (its functional integrity) grants it intrinsic</page><page sequence="15">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 45 moral standing. The human duty is to preserve that which is required for the pro- duction of the highest good, especially since humanity can have detrimental effects on nature's basic functioning. Our strategic rationality requires us to be responsi- ble to nature, both in the preservation of its integrity and the conservation of our resource use of it. The policy imperative is to respect the causality of nature while utilizing it primarily for moral purposes, that is, for those uses which are necessary to our autonomy, and never to the extent that its functional integrity is compro- mised. In effect, as the "ultimate" expression of nature, humanity is charged with reshaping both itself and nature in terms of the moral law. Humanity is charged with the duty to produce the "highest good as the overall harmony of experience and morality, or as moral nature. . .created by human action (by man's reshaping of the sensuous world in light of a supersensuous idea, and by his creating new social and ecological systems)" (Yovel 1980, 50).22 Humankind protects its humanity through an active and just state. We also have the responsibility to protect and empower the environment as an end through an active policy of government regulation. This duty to nature comes from three practical realizations. 1. The moral integrity of humanity and the functional integrity of nature are interdependent in the greater "whole" or ecosystem. 2. The technology of humanity presents the greatest challenge to the persis- tence of this scheme of interdependence. 3. Humanity alone has both the moral capacity and the strategic rationality to express freedom responsibly and innovate or adapt itself so that interde- pendence with the environment can persist over time and establish the har- mony of human and natural realms. Although humanity is again a central character and the moral agent in the real- ization of harmony, the duty one has is not only to nature in view of the end of humans' autonomy, but to nature as a separate and independent component of greater ecosystems where the interface between humanity and nature is what requires regulation, and where the responsibility to establish harmony is human- ity's alone. It is immoral for humankind to use a natural system as a means to its own ends without simultaneously treating it as a living, functioning, end-in-itself. Respecting nature does not mean that we never use resources or place the environ- ment at risk or pollute it. Respect is the recognition that nature exists as a total sys- tem with capacity, ability, and purpose for perfection within itself, and by its own biological and chemical standards and processes, which command respect inde- pendent of us. In the same way that individuals can morally "use" one another as long as they, simultaneously, respect humanity as an end-in-itself (Kant GW, 428) through the test of the moral law, humanity can use a natural system if this use is responsi-</page><page sequence="16">1 46 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 ble to the intrinsic value of that system and leaves its functional processes intact and/or enhanced or positively reshaped by the application of the moral law. Man is no longer a member among other members in nature. Rather, by virtue of his rational consciousness, he now becomes the focal point of nature itself .. .rea- son... makes nature itself possible by imparting a logical structure to it. Human reason thus becomes a world-shaping power. (Yovel 1980, 136) However, if humanity abuses the functional integrity of the environment so that natural cycles are permanently interrupted, species are lost forever, and natu- ral energy and material cycles fail, the natural system will not persist as natural selection and, therefore, evolution ceases. This would be the result of immoral action on the part of humanity independent of the fact that mankind will eventually cause its own demise by these perturbations (Goodin 1976, 176-77).24 With this in mind, humanity should do nothing that would damage the overall functional integrity and interdependence of natural systems but should be respon- sible and coordinate choices to establish a harmony between natural and artificial worlds. As mankind is charged, through politics, to protect and empower the dig- nity of the individual, we must also, by the same means, endeavor to protect and empower the functional integrity of natural systems for their own sake as well as our own. But the imperative to "reshape" nature has a positive as well as protective meaning. In order to reshape, we must first protect and preserve that functionality that allows natural systems persistence in the first place. But the duty to reshape is one to enhance the natural capacity, ability, and purpose of nature as we empower our own autonomy. Humanity's destiny is tied to nature as nature's is to humanity's, and with the governing of the moral law, in both our consideration of human and natural sys- tems, we have a unique definition of environmental ethics that provides for human action, not only to conserve resources and preserve natural function but also to empower natural evolution through the restoration and enhancement of natural systems' processes. To reshape ourselves according to the moral law is to encourage the best in ourselves and our capacity, ability, and purpose. It is the same with our imperative to reshape nature in terms of its own sense of integrity. The moral law sets all stan- dards of moral behavior in relation to both humanity and the environment as well as between them. Here abuse, exploitation, and waste are outside the moral pale. The imperative to protect and preserve the functional integrity of nature in environmental policy and law might involve any or all of the following: not replac- ing natural systems with artificial ones if this means the destruction of the integrity of that system; not sacrificing nature merely for man's utility maximization; not inflicting synthetic compounds on the environment or technologies that cannot be processed by a system's natural cleaning mechanisms; keeping all pollution to the minimum necessary for supporting human moral integrity and always within the</page><page sequence="17">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 47 capacity of the natural system to process waste and clean itself; recycling as much of what we need as possible so that the cost of our technological requirements rests on humanity and not on the productive capacity of natural systems; domesticating species necessary to our survival so that the biodiversity of wild species can pursue their functional end within nature; always replacing what we take out of the envi- ronment as compensation in kind for each ecological sub-system (land reclama- tion, reforestation, purification of the water cycle, etc.); placing the burden of proof on those who would use nature and not on those who would preserve it from use; "allocating natural resources to peaceful uses and to the real needs of man" (Yovel 1980, 196); and, most generally, never imposing a risk on a natural system that has a high probability of irreversible or irrevocable damage to its functional integrity when only the elective wants or efficiencies of humans are at stake.25 Though it may be the case that nature can destroy itself and has the capacity to allow one species to die and another to continue to evolve, this internal natural selection is part of the unique capacity and potential of nature and therefore part of its functional properties and a mark of its intrinsic value that man has a duty to pro- tect and empower. Humanity, on the other hand, because it can both technologi- cally and morally innovate, must do so with minimal disturbance of the greater ecosystem. It is, therefore, the human capacity for freedom, and not nature's capacity for causal functioning, that puts mutualism and the interdependence of integrities at greatest risk through human perturbation, and it is also here where our duty lies. To show proper respect for nature is a subject of justice. Individuals can antic- ipate the irresponsible expression of freedom through the construction of political institutions within just states, that not only protect and empower humanity, but the intrinsic value of nature. The mandate of the just state working for respect of nat- ural systems can be characterized as the imperative to harmonize the freedom of humanity with the structure and function of nature so that the intrinsic value of each is appreciated and one complements the other harmoniously. In this way, the respect humanity shows itself and nature will be rewarded by the persistence of an environment that provides both an evolutionary home, equally, for all human beings, and the life support system in which everyone's practical reason is nur- tured and perfected. To the advantage of a policy maker attempting to be just to both her duties to humanity and nature, the two duties can be simultaneously fulfilled by the same environmental law. In the process of properly conserving those natural resources that we need for our moral autonomy, humanity is ethically required, as a prereq- uisite, to respect nature as a duty to its unique causal capacity, evolutionary ability and teleological purpose or potential; that is, its functional integrity. The func- tional integrity of nature is therefore a necessary component of the moral integrity of humanity. When we make public choices that protect the environment and place the bur- den of proof on those who would use it to justify that use as essential to human</page><page sequence="18">1 48 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 ends, we will coincidentally produce the best conditions in which the process of natural selection in nature and the quest for personal autonomy by humanity both find their "highest" expression. The harmony of integrities gives the imperative to humans to regulate their behavior in such a way that we harm neither ourselves nor nature in any essential, that is intrinsic, way. In this consideration, however, nature has a priority because it is, in a sense, vulnerable in the face of humanity's capacity to technologically innovate. CONCLUSION It may well be that in "creating man nature has transcended itself (Elster 1979, 16), that, in its "ultimate purpose" (Kant C3, §82), nature has put itself at a disadvantage to its progeny. But because only humanity has a moral dimension, natural systems have a strong call on humanity's moral sensibilities as nature has few options in its ongoing evolutionary gradient climbing but to adapt to what humanity imposes upon it. The overall moral imperative, the duty of man to nature through political reg- ulation, is to harmonize both types of life on earth: functional and moral. Only with proper self-regulation will humanity, nature, and the interdependent intrinsic val- ues these represent, persist into the future, where each enhances the other's quality of life. "It may be the persistence of life itself, of which the forms of life (including man) are multiple investments, which provides the environmental imperative (if there be one)" (Goodpaster 1979, 35, n.26). The only species that can be moral, that can assign value to anything, is humanity. Humankind, under the moral law, assigns an intrinsic value to humanity through the moral capacity to be autonomous and perfect the self as a moral agent. Humanity is also part of the biota and evolved from within the process of natural selection. Placing Kant's theory within the context of ecological thinking we can say that humanity is the most complex and perfect product of natural evolution and the highest or ultimate teleological purpose of nature is in humanity (Kant C3, §82). If humankind abuses the integrity of the environment so that species are lost forever and natural cycles and systems fail to operate and evolve properly, human- kind will eventually cause its own demise. On the other hand, without the self-reg- ulation of humanity, nature can look forward to a continued diminution of its component subsystems until the day when its evolutionary patterns fail altogether. Overall, the integrity of nature is protected, both as an instrumental resource to humanity and as a functional end-in-itself, through the application of Kant's moral law to individual maxims and to collective juridical law (Zammito 1992, 332). When we consider our freedom and the imperatives of morality and justice we will not only understand how we ought to relate to one another, but how we should best handle the ecosystem interfaces between humanity and nature.</page><page sequence="19">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 49 Kant states that "without man. . .the whole of creation would be a mere wilder- ness, a thing in vain, and have no final end" (Kant C3, 442). However, humanity's responsibility is also to insure that with humanity the world does not become "a thing in vain" but is enhanced by the ethical conduct of its most versatile species. On this point I agree with Yovel (1980, 180). This dictum does not mean that the appearance of man as a natural being supplies the rest of nature with a teleological center to which all others are subservient. On the con- trary, if man were just another link in nature, creation would still be "a thing in vain and have no final end.'* The universe needs man so that he, as a free and conscious creature, can confer its final end on the world and change himself and nature in such a way as to realize it. A Kantian environmental ethics is comprehensive because it grants morally relevant value to nature in terms of both the conservation of resources for human perfection and also in terms of nature's intrinsic functional value as a component of greater ecosystems. Kant's environmental ethics support an ideal-regarding concern for both human and natural perfection and steers policy toward those laws which would increase harmony between humanity and nature and consider the environment as both a necessary element to human freedom and to the "highest good" of biospheric evolution. Kant indeed has an environmental ethic that can be used to produce just policy for both humanity and nature. It begins with two concepts of intrinsic value and prescribes a policy that considers the environment as an entity unto itself and wor- thy of equal representation in the definition of justice and ethical perfection. If Kant is a human-centered ethicist, he is unique and able to give us the tools for a distinct and unique approach to environmental policy argument that respects eco- systems as interfaces between humanity and nature, where each has an integrity that ought to be a critical consideration in any public choice. Nominally, Kant belongs with those for whom man is the center of creation. Yet for Kant man's preeminence is not given and automatically guaranteed;... man enjoys a central position not by virtue of what he is, but by virtue of what he ought to do and to become. He must make himself the center of creation by using his practical reason to determine its end and by consciously acting to realize it. (Yovel 1980, 180) Kant's categorical imperative requires humanity to overcome fear with moral- ity and utilize intellectually approved principle to navigate in a world of uncer- tainty. It is in this search for moral autonomy that humanity not only finds itself, and social justice, but also a respect for, and harmony with, nature.27 Our applica- tion of practical reason to environmental questions therefore requires the equal and conscious consideration of nature as the prior functional component of a greater, ongoing, evolutionary process (Kant C3, 449 fn.).

NOTES 1. This essay is an effort to argue that the philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant contain an environmental ethic which anticipates modern ecological discourse and provides an alternative basis for environmental policy choice. I understand the chronology here and that Kant's "teleol- ogy of nature" was not Darwinian. I do not mean to mix up what Kant thought and said with what post-Darwinians think. However, I do wish to suggest that Kant anticipated our systemic and evolutionary understanding of nature in his philosophical writings. I mean to transfer or extend or translate Kant's approach to nature into familiar evolutionary and ecological terms and demonstrate that Kant's pre-evolutionary insights can illuminate contemporary ways of thinking, while they also provide, in our integration of Kantian and Darwinian concepts, a rea- sonable definition of human duties to nature. 2. The reader should be aware that my argument is predicated upon a nonstandard definition of intrinsic or inherent value that is not identical to current usage and which makes no distinction between these two terms. I will argue that "inherent" and "intrinsic" are interchangeable terms for the same concept of noninstrumental value which is different only in its application to humanity (where it has an individual moral foundation) as distinguished from nature (where it has a systemic funtional foundation). Therefore, the core distinction is between instrumental and intrinsic value. Moral status in human deliberation is a function of classification by type of value (Plant 1991; Sagoff 1988). The individual (or collective) will orient itself toward everything it encounters in the world and grant it a status as either something that can be used to one's benefit having only instrumental value, or something that has a status independent of its human use, which grants it an intrinsic value. The basic dichotomy between instrumental and intrinsic value is the foundation upon which all moral philosophies and personal ethical calculations are made and it is the starting point for anyone interested in the moral status of any entity in the human lexicon of ethical eval- uation. While instrumental value is not a hard concept to understand, intrinsic value requires a more specific definition. Anything valued only for its use as a means to a further end is valued instru- mentally. Kant maintains that it is not an end-in-itself but a means to some other end. If a tree is valued instrumentally it is valued for the wood it produces to build houses, as a means to the end of shelter, and not as an end-in-itself. Kant defines intrinsic value in terms of status as an end- in-itself. It is placing value in a thing for itself and not as a means to something else. 3. I wish to assure the reader that the novel position on Kantian environmental ethics that is stated at the beginning of the paper is in due course argued for with close attention to a full range of Kantian text. I ask, therefore, that the reader work through the entire argument before making a judgment on these initial, unconventional claims. 4. In her essay (1992), Elizabeth Harlow defines four senses in which the value of nature might be considered "humanly independent" (28). To quote her "(1) we might want to say that the value of natural objects and processes is not reducible to human interests and preferences; (2) we might want to say that the value of natural objects and processes is not reducible to the value of human experiences or form of consciousness excited by them; (3) we might want to say that the value of natural objects and processes is independent of human good; or (4) we might want to claim that the value of nature and its processes is independent of human consciousness alto- gether" (28). My argument is that rather than being a classically anthropocentric ethics, Kant's moral and political thought supports the independence of nature on all of these counts. Even the last, which, while it does not make sense in terms of the moral value of nature, which is impos-</page><page sequence="21">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 5 1 sible without human consciousness, makes sense for Kant in terms of the prior independence of time, space and organic organization in a scientific sense (Kant Cl). 5. Here "ecosystem" is not understood as a synonym for nature but is the combination of human systems and natural systems. My use of biosphere is also nontraditional in that it does not equal nature but includes humanity. A fuller explanation of what I define as a "Kantian" biosphere made up of ecosystems comes later. 6. For a look at world systems see (Jantsch and Waddington 1976). 7. For an examination of how environmental political theory has evolved and how conservation and preservation have responded to one another see (Taylor 1992). 8. Lewis White Beck puts it this way: "Nature produced man but brought him to the stage where he can finally assert his independence of her"(1960, 125). For Kant's argument about human- ity's transcendence of nature see (UH). 9. Logicians call it a category mistake when one uses a term to connote a quality that a particular class of actors does not have. In this way to say that an animal has rights is like saying snow has a consciousness. Although it can be a logical and moral possibility that a human acted unjustly in killing another living entity, it may make neither logical nor moral sense to say that a wolf acted unjustly when it killed its prey. 10. The only specific reference he makes to the mere use of nature is in human use of those natural products that they grow themselves with the help of civil society (Kant MM, 344-46). These "natural products" which are considered "artifacts" of human social production are reduced to the status of things only by their existence as artifacts. However, in general, the components of natural systems, especially in the wild, are not classified as artifacts and therefore hold a status between things and humanity. 1 1 . This might be defined as Kantian Sustainability . 12. Kant's treatment of property and human use of it (MM 258-7 1) may hold lessons for the appli- cation of the moral law to environmental policy. Specifically the idea that property is a neces- sary prerequisite to human freedom would be a powerful argument for Kantian Conservationism. 13. Two points: First, it is controversial to attribute a "teleology" to nature. I would argue that this is because one is transferring what is a moral, goal-directed, agency-based attribute of a person to natural systems. I will assert here that as Kant has two definitions of intrinsic value, one for humanity and one for nature, he also argues for two concepts of teleology, the human variant having moral content, while the one used to describe nature is functional. For my purposes, "teleology" applied to nature simply means that natural systems have dynamic and systemic functional properties that change over time, sometimes to more complexity, sometimes to less. I assume with Golley (1993) that the concept of natural systems evolution does not need to be strictly deterministic, and with Simberloff (1980) and Williams (1966, chap. 5) that natural sys- tems behavior can be assumed to have a stochastic element that can be compensated for by the model used to explain it (O'Neill et al. 1986). This is not unlike the inclusion of stochastic com- ponents in statistical models that predict human behavior (see Manheim and Rich 1986); Hanushek and Jackson 1977). Pimm (1991, 131) covered the bases when he argues that "[e]ven the most simple models of population change show a variety of behaviors that include a simple return to equilibrium, cycles, cycles on cycles, and chaos. . .". Perhaps evolution as natural selec- tion is a two-step process where randomness in stage one is combined with tendencies toward natural harmony in step two so that "only that which maintains or increases the harmony of the system will be selected" (Mayr 1976, 24-25). Or perhaps Von Schilcher and Tennant (1984, 72) are correct when they write that "[e]volution can thus be seem as a climb up a mountainside with resting points in sheltered spots; a ratchet-like ridge with stopping places separated by slippery slopes." Overall, from my perspective, teleology or purpose applied to nature is a causal-func- tional teleology of nature's nonhuman sub-systems that finds changes of complexity in natural</page><page sequence="22">1 52 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 3, No. 2, 1 998 selection where evolution is progressive while it shows elements of entropy (Brooks and Wiley, 1988). Second, for years there have been efforts (See Riley 1983) to describe Kant's politics as dependent on his teleology as put forth in the Third Critique (C3). Elsewhere (Gillroy 1992; 1997) I have argued that the politics does not require Kant's teleology but is a direct outgrowth of his moral theory applied juridically. While I still contend that Kant's politics is deontological, I have found a new role for Kant's teleology in building a bridge between the realm of nature and the realm of ends. In this way, consciousness of Kant's two definitions of teleology might be necessary for environmental policy in particular. 14. I will avoid the use of the concept of functional autonomy, as with humanity as an agent-cause, nature is no longer autonomous, though it does have an independent definition of integrity. 15. Anthropomorphism is the tendency of humans to define nonhuman entities in human terms. It is our propensity to attribute human qualities (e.g., rights, duties, emotional conditions) to non- human life (e.g., natural systems) and to deal with these entities only in our terms and not in their own. Anthropocentrism is the tendency to assess human value as central and most impor- tant in the evaluation of the human-nonhuman interrelationships. Conservationism is an envi- ronmental ethics that places the value of humanity at the center and describes all nonhuman entities as having value only to the extent they can be used by humanity (e.g., a tree is only board feet of lumber and a rain forest ecosystem only present and future drugs for human health). Therefore, while a moral evaluation that speaks of the nonhuman world in human terms can be said to be anthropomorphic, one that speaks as if human values were more critical and at a higher level than any or all nonhuman systems, is anthropocentric. Some environmental ethics such as Conservationism (Taylor 1992, chap.l) is both anthropomorphic and anthropocentric, while others like deep ecology (Devall and Sessions 1985) are only anthropomorphic in that they attribute human characteristics to ecosystems (e.g., rights, duties) but not anthropocentric in that they value humanity and ecosystems equally as one natural and interdependent system. 16. It is true that, for eons, nature persisted without humanity. My point is that now, as ecosystems are made up of the interaction of human and natural systems that each has an effect on the evo- lution and persistence of the other. Nature is affected by us and can have its evolution inter- rupted, delayed or shifted by our actions. 17. Here "reshaping" includes human contact and influence upon the natural world. 18. Let us remember that the physical conditions of the realm of ends is achieved through the cre- ation of a just society. 19. Purpose can be translated as end. 20. The intrinsic value of the individual, therefore, lies not in his personhood or the dignity that he has in the external world, but with his essential and internal integrity of will, (his capacity, abil- ity and purpose), and the potential that capacity has to perfect itself in external moral agency. In the case of humanity, this capacity and potential involve freedom as a moral agent, which is unique to humanity as an end in itself. 21 . One would have to argue that God had merely instrumental value. Kant does not. 22. This has been characterized as Darstellung or "the externalization of morality in the natural world" (Yovel 1980, 70-71). 23. Treating ecosystems as having intrinsic functional value principally supports a noninterference policy on the part of people, but it can also be argued that humans have a duty to enhance the ongoing evolution of ecosystems by providing, for example, regeneration of species and organic components upon which the ecosystem might be dependent. 24. On the other hand, without the support of humanity, with its scientific efforts to save species, and reinvigorate ecosystem processes, one could argue that nature can look forward to a contin- ued diminution of its component subsystems as entropy overcomes ecosystem organization,</page><page sequence="23">Kantian Ethics and Environmental Policy Argument 1 53 homeostasis fails, and evolutionary patterns cease. This may be the true basis of mutualism between humanity and the environment. 25. Respect for the functional integrity of the ecosystem is for the whole, for the connections between organisms and levels of organization and unlike respect for moral integrity, does not concern each individual organism. In this case while an argument can be made that humanity has a duty to, for example, a nonhuman species, the same argument cannot be made that it has a duty to any individual member of that nonhuman species. 26. The Kantian approach is here more conscious of the unique capabilities of humanity than, for example, deep ecology (Devall and Sessions 1985). For the deep ecologist, humanity is equal to nature and just another class of organism with no special capacities or abilities. 27. For a more detailed examination of this search for environmental justice see my complete argu- ment for a Kantian Paradigm for Environmental Policy &amp; Law (Gillroy 1997).
