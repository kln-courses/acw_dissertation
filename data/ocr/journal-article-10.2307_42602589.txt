This volume is the account of a project by an American student sponsored jointly by the Maria Moors Cabot Foundation, the Harvard Forest (Petersham, Mass.) and the Atkins Garden and Research Laboratory (Cienfuegos, Cuba). It describes very vividly the remaining forest resources of Cuba and draws an alarming picture of the rapid rate at which they are being destroyed. The general set-up is one essentially typical of Latin America. The population is increasing extremely rapidly so that there is heavy pressure for land for subsistence agriculture. As the outlook of the peasant is essentially exploitative, any natural resources in timber, fuel and soil fertility are recklessly pillaged without regard to replace- ment or future needs and the Government stands by and looks on, contenting itself with the promulgation of high-sounding slogans such as that "the conservation of natural resources is the grand preoccupation of the State". The remaining forests and woodlands of the island are estimated at 1,000,000 acres of pine stands and 3,000,000 acres of broad- leaf. Much of these areas has already been heavily cut over. Reserves of pine are considered to contain only a further ten years' supply at the present rate of cut, and already 70% of the pine used in Cuba has to be imported. The broadleaf forests likewise cannot satisfy the demand. Local forest production is steadily falling and reliance upon imports increasing, and at the same time there is a fall in per capita consumption. Since 72 % of the wood utilised in Cuba in 1951 was in the form of fuel, either firewood or charcoal, the future outlook for the population as regards supplies of this necessary resource are some- what bleak. The remaining forest areas are located mainly in the various mountain ranges and are essentially divisible into pinares or pine stands and monte or broadleaved forest. The monte is locally classified into monte fresco on deep, moist, fertile sites and monte bravo on the shallower, drier soils. Except in the Sierra Maestra the pine lands tend to be located on "lateritic" soils derived from serpentine. In the Sierra Maestra the pine occurs on other formations colonising rocky ridges and landslip scars where competition from broadleaved species is reduced. As these pine soils are unsuitable for agriculture, they are exempt from destruction for this purpose, but are subject to heavy exploita- tion followed by repeated fires which destroy regeneration. The monte is subject to assault from all sides. The most valuable trees are cut first, then the secondary hard- woods, smaller stems are hewn into sleepers and fence posts, after which the charcoal burner completes clearing the site. Monte fresco soils are then put to agricultural use. Attempts at reforestation by government or private agency appear to be negligible and the prospect is one of almost complete extinction of the remaining forest resources within a generation. It is only to be hoped that some action will be taken to organise regeneration of the pine lands before this point is reached. Being of no agricultural value, the "lateritic" pine soils are a resource that clearly should be devoted to forestry, and judging by the economic success that some of the Caribbean pines have been in South Africa, for example, an enormous contribution could be made to the national income. Full utilisation of the million acres of pine land, even if an increment of only 100 cu. ft. per acre per annum were secured, would produce three times Cuba's require- ments of wood and enable her to become an exporter. Such a development is at present unfortunately at variance with the Latin- American mentality. As a practical account of the forest resources of the country, the work is informative and well written and the author is to be congratulated on the amount of data he collected in his brief field work of little over one year. The photographs are excellent. Lack of fuller acquaintance with Caribbean conditions has inevitably meant that the author had to lean heavily on the ideas of local woodsmen, which may often prove to be old wives' tales on fuller investigation. Such, for instance, is the statement that monte bravo typically pro- duces maderas duras or hard, durable woods and monte fresco the maderas blancas or soft, white woods. This conception is anthropomorphic and from his own experi- ence the writer doubts if it is actually true. There is nothing in the species lists given to support it. The ecological treatment given by the author to his forest types is most unsatisfying and bespeaks lack of familiarity with tropical ecology. J. S. Beard. 197</page></plain_text>
