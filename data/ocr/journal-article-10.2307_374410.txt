I ONCE UPON A TIME I realized that the word "liberal" in the phrase "liberal edu- cation" was related to the political desig- nation, "liberal." A "liberal" American values justice, equal opportunity, and freedom, and he also believes that these social qualities are built into the structure of things so that if all men act rationally, with good will, and with energetic con- cern, the result will be liberty and justice for all. Since we have obviously not ar- rived at this result, the fault must be in the irrationality, bad faith, and apathy of you and me. An educator in the liberal tradition starts from this premise to work on the irrationality and misanthropy of Man-embodied concretely in his unre- generate students. He does this by point- ing to the "self-evident truths" of his subject matter, be it English, History, Art, or Biology. These truths appear to him as objective, ethically neutral, and given. His articulation of them to a younger generation seems to be pure public service. Any alternatives, such as teaching diolects in place of Standard En- glish or Cuban poetry under Contempor- ary Literature, appear to him highly par- tisan and political, while his own acquies- cence to a tradition appears to be an act of reason. The selection of the monuments of the literary tradition is a very mysterious process. It obviously does not operate by popular acclaim, since Gone With the Wind and Uncle Tom's Cabin (a monu- ment in another field) are not making it. Barbara Kessel has taught in high schools and in Malcolm X Community College. "Free, Class- less, and Urbane?" is reprinted from The Radical Teacher 2 (Dec. 30, 1969), and it will also ap- pear in An Anti-Text in Literature, ed. Louis Kampf &amp; Paul Lauter, to be published by Pan- theon this year. 531</page><page sequence="2">532 COLLEGE ENGLISH We do not have boards which designate the classics, and prizes are often wide of the mark. Northrop Frye describes it as a magical process, wherein works that liberate the mind are liberated into the culture by the minds they liberated: The ethical purpose of a liberal education is to liberate, which can only mean to make one capable of conceiving society as free, classless, and urbane. No such so- ciety exists, which is one reason why a liberal education must be deeply con- cerned with works of imagination. The imaginative element in works of art, again, lifts them clear of the bondage of history. Anything that emerges from the total experience of criticism to form part of a liberal education becomes, by virtue of that fact, part of the emancipated and humane community of culture, whatever its original reference. Thus liberal educa- tion liberates the works of culture them- selves as well as the mind they educate.1 Notice how the works emerge and float upward-leaving history and classes down below-to join the "free, classless urbane world" which exists only in the minds of the truly educated. Although the vocab- ulary is anthropomorphic and the human agent is obscured, it is there: "the total experience of criticism" is the originator, and that means critics, or men and wo- men. In America that means liberals. How do they know when they meet a great work of art? When it is ironic, ambig- uous, and humane-which means filled with the nobility of freedom, justice, compassion, as well as the tragedy of Man's irrationality and misanthropy. This may seem a peculiar kit with which to greet the working-class, non-elite stu- dents that most English teachers teach, but these values are the "critical tools" that were laid on us in graduate school or before, where alternatives were alluded to as minor heresies of one kind or another. As I have implied, the true liberal has a lot to do to make the system work: his task is nothing less than humanizing and civilizing people who would otherwise remain irrational and misanthropic. This means that he must have in his mind some model of a humane, civilized person. From Northrop Frye, one of the most admired critics in American graduate schools, I learn that the civilized man spends most of his mental energy in a "free, classless, urbane society." At the same time, he must transcend by scorn, like Camus' Sisyphus, the fact that he doesn't actually live in such a world, which means that irony becomes an im- portant strategy for survival. If only the blacks, the students, and the workers could be persuaded to adopt this superior mode of being, society might be peaceful, and the powerful might be free of "social problems." My first years of teaching, though joyful at times, were filled with a general frustration. My students were not being humanized by contact with Huckleberry Finn or The Scarlet Letter. They had a stubborn literal-mindedness that steadily refused my invitation to take flight into societies and lives of the imagination. They insisted on looking at things from their point of view: they did not see any rivers to float down or houses in the woods to retreat to with embroidery. One student told me he was "very dis- appointed in me" for my professed desire to live by a Walden Pond. They were not moved by Huck Finn's lack of racism to feel guilt over their own racism, partly because there is plenty in the book to confirm their racism. Above all else, they I Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (Prince- ton Univ. Press, 1957), pp. 347-348.</page><page sequence="3">Free, Classless, and Urbane? 533 were offended by Huckleberry Finn's shiftlessness. Nobody had ever allowed them to be shiftless and nobody, it ap- peared, ever would. Why, here they were, for example, sweating away in English class learning to talk proper and Huck Finn didn't even give a damn that he sounded ignorant. As for Sisyphus, or one version of civilized man, the students, be they black or white, cannot agree less with the dictum that "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Many teachers who live with themselves as failures sur- mount it by scorn of their students, if not the whole human race-a common fruit of the liberal world-view. But non- elite students are seldom liberals and they face rocks to push that are not mental or psychological, but physical, and the con- frontation between them and possibility of futility in their labors cannot be tran- scended. ("Do you mean that my parents spent their lives in those crummy jobs and saved their money so that I could go to college, and I am still not going to do any better? Do you mean that people can try as hard as they can and still not make it in America?") A life of alienated labor is not transcendable by scorn, because there is no way of feeling superior to that fate-only intellectuals can feel superior to a condition of power- lessness and manipulation. Sometimes that strategy breaks down for them, too. There are three basic responses to the discovery, gradual or swift, that one is not getting ahead of most people in a society where everyone worth anything is supposed to get ahead of everyone else. First, an internal sense of failure and in- adequacy, known as self-hatred. Second, a sense of oppression due to a partial understanding that failure doesn't come simply from one's own inadequacy; what follows is a shifting of blame to someone else, usually socially-fostered targets of black people, Jews, communist "conspir- ators," and women (usually one's wife and/or mother), who become objects of deep resentment. Third, a sense of anger and outrage, not at the victims, but at those responsible for perpetuating a sys- tem in which human potentiality is either crushed or channeled into the building of empire at home and abroad, and in which the only way to get ahead is to climb on bodies. This third possible response is the most rational, the least self-destructive, the most socially constructive, and the rarest-not because people are basically irrational and prone to hate others, but because everything possible has been done, through the media, the textbooks, the school discipline, the military, and the organization of the work force to social- ize people toward the first two modes of being. This is neither conspiratorial nor unnatural, for social systems develop ac- cording to principles of preservation. What may be reasonable for the survival of a particular social system may have little to do, however, with the survival of the people in it. Teachers face daily the contradiction that to serve the school and the curriculum is to hurt the stu- dents. As an English teacher, I came to realize that my particular curriculum- when it "takes"-tends toward the pro- duction of alienated, anxious, phony people, thoroughly mystified about them- selves and their society, who are thus manipulable all their working lives long, just like the professors who are the proto- types of this kind of intellectual socializa- tion. Seeing this, the radical teacher, at the strong risk of short tenure, must attempt to provide analyses that will help locate the sources of power and responsibility in</page><page sequence="4">534 COLLEGE ENGLISH this society. Or his attempt to turn people on to themselves (a la Holt, Kohl, and Herndon) will be the hundred flowers blossoming, but withering the same day. For example, students need to learn that language is a social and political tool, con- stantly being changed for social purposes. If all the people who say "he ain't" and "he be" changed miraculously tomorrow to saying "he isn't," there would be just as miraculous a compensatory change up higher in the social scale, so that the lower people could never catch up. One Eliza Doolittle is O.K., but her cousins and her uncles and her aunts are definitely too many. Most English teachers don't know that themselves, and liberals are teaching that all dialects are groovy, but we must use each one only where appropriate- "separate but equal," each to its rightful place-is what the students can hear. This is some more of that "free, classless ur- bane society" that we don't live in. II From the beginning of teaching, I could hear my students-whether white or black, in high school or college-say- ing, "English stinks." Until America radi- calized me, I could not understand that their gutsy rejection was not in childish rebellion against what was good for them, but out of some awareness of who they were. Of course, there are students who are completely niggerized and come to the teacher for treatment so they will be acceptable. ("I'll do anything you say; just tell me how, so I can get an A.") But I am happy to report that there are mil- lions of kids out here, One Dimensional Man to the contrary, who are insistent: "English stinks-even more than History, Biology, and P.E. They mess over your mind in this place, man!" Since the best way to understand someone else's oppres- sion is to understand your own, it was my own similar suspicion in graduate school that taught me to respect such a conclu- sion, and to embark on "learning from the people" what was wrong with my teach- ers. While this revolutionary slogan may ring dead to most people in the U.S., it has rich tones of meaning to a radical in a profession, who realizes that his skills will serve only the powerful unless he can learn to see through eyes other than his own middle-class ones. This is not to suggest the romanticism that all wisdom lies in the working class. It is only to say that my working class students provided me with some essential wisdom, with a fresh perspective on the limits and defici- encies of currently accepted literary and "liberal" values of irony, ambiguity, and humanity. In a community college class on Third W,orld Literature, composed of twelve black and two white students, we read "The Prisoner," a story by a black South African in African Writing Today (Pen- guin Books). The story concerns the switching of roles between the white boss, George, and his black servant, Mulela. The narration is in the first person by Mulela, who informs us that George is in jail in the basement but that he receives the best of care despite rumors about whippings and electric shock. Mu- lela lives upstairs with George's wife and they both cry over "poor George" while lolling in bed together. The end suggests strongly that just as George lost his posi- tion of power by lusting after a black servant-woman, Mulela, too, may fall be- cause of his weakness for the white wife. Before class discussion, students wrote three type of papers. From the whites came an outraged sympathy for Poor George who was being so cruelly per-</page><page sequence="5">Free, Classless, and Urbane? 535 secuted. To them he was "The Fixer." From most of the blacks came exultant praise of Mulela, who was clever enough to escape being a slave and yet generous enough not to treat his former master with cruelty. From one light-skinned and rather bourgeois young black man came a discourse on man's inhumanity to man in this "dog-eat-dog-world." I carefully demonstrated the irony of the story, which made both straight views of George and Mulela incomplete or false and pointed out that the lone student had "gotten" the irony, but if that was the conclusion to be drawn from it, I'd have to think again about the story, which I had "instinctively" liked because of its irony. The students were depressed-they had all liked the story very much, precise- ly because they had read it as very straightforward, a sort of "Under the Lion's Paw" in black and white, or white and black. Coming to the story from our individual perspectives of black oppression, white oppression, middle- class upward mobility, and literary learn- ing, we had collided in the middle and the story had slipped out from under us all. There was a feeling of betrayal-as if we had all come home from an inspiring rally to find that the main speaker was really an agent. What happened next appears in retro- spect to have been a series of attempts to recoup the loss. The students discussed role-playing the story as it had first ap- peared to various people. This proved to be too scary, but each reasserted his vision of the story while discussing the pro- jected role-playing. I asked them, "Why should the author, who was black him- self, treat it as ironic that Mulela op- presses and tortures George? That kind of revenge-oppression is perfectly under- standable in terms of psychology or of Old Testament justice. Did Nat Turner need to have interesting sexual fantasies in order to desire the death of his masters?" They didn't have any answers for me, and none were necessary, for it was my hang-up, not theirs. The lesson that emerged for me in time was the one which forms the basis of this paper: op- pression is not amusing or ironic to those who are actually oppressed. It is an aes- thetic mode most appropriate to the rul- ing class. One of Northrop Frye's defini- tions of irony is helpful here. (His defini- tions are usually useful because, unlike New Critical definitions, they are given, at least, in social terms.) If inferior in power or intelligence to ourselves, so that we have the sense of looking down on a scene of bondage, and frustration, or absurdity, the hero belongs to an ironic mode. This is still true when the reader feels that he is or might be in the same situation, as the situation is be- ing judged by the norms of a greater freedom. . . . During the last hundred years, most serious fiction has tended to be increasingly ironic in mode. (Anatomy of Criticism, pp. 34-35.) This explains to me why ironic litera- ture is so very appealing to those on the way down in the social scale (the norms of greater freedom) and so unappealing or incomprehensible to those who are struggling upward or who are perma- nently down-that is, to most everyone. III The English professor tends to portray as a model his own ironic, faintly self- mocking life-style. It is his defense against having gone to an elite institution and ending up on the frontier-at State U. or Community College teaching the Bar- barians. If he takes his irony far enough, he simply finds all convictions naive and</page><page sequence="6">536 COLLEGE ENGLISH rather amusing. If he does not have the fortitude and alienation to be so extreme, he may employ another defense, and use his cultivated capacity to create or find ambiguity where things would seem to be simple. He feels confident that such perceptions are the mark of superior in- tellect, and they give him the grounds for moderate, balanced stands (a little evil in all positions) on all matters politi- cal or poetical. This use of ambiguity has its dangers, for most people do not con- sider ambiguity a comfortable resting- place. A classroom where ambiguity has filtered into students' minds becomes electric; no one can sit still for the rest- lessness of it. Of necessity, people act continually, so that doubt cast upon the validity of anything previously accepted demands immediate attention lest we become "hung up"-unable to act in any way convincing to ourselves. Artists generally are human beings who deal, through some medium, with this agonizing transition from one way of perception to another. Their works can be an invitation to an audience to participate in that process as they have structured it. However, this is an embarrassingly dynamic and moral situation, and New Criticism provides a poetic ideology that can get around it by treating the poem as a monument, cut off from author and audience. Thus ambig- uity becomes a technical matter, internal to the literary work alone. The professor can then interpret any work exhaustively without question of his own moral values, for these supposedly do not touch on his authority to interpret, which springs from his technical expertise. The student then becomes the apprentice to the master metaphor analyst, and the classroom set- tles down to a cemetery atmosphere ap- propriate to monuments. This is the general ambiance of gradu- ate schools of English-and if you don't like it, you can leave. But of course, high schools are filled with captives, not ap- prentices. Adolescents are naive, that is to say, they take themselves rather seri- ously, so when they "take" a work of art, they take it seriously, as something ad- dressed to them. (They take it if they can see it as addressed to them; other- wise, nothing happens but "teacher talk.") In my first year of teaching, I had assigned American plays to be read in small groups within a class. Typical of a first-year teacher, I had no particular purpose in mind: we were "covering" American literature. Electricity began crackling in one group of five as they discussed The Glass Menagerie. When Laura, the crippled sister, blows out her candles at the end of the play, it is not apparent whether she is blowing away illusion or life itself. Interpretation de- pends upon the meaning constructed around the gentleman caller who decided to treat Laura as though she were a healthy girl, who talked with her, danced with her, and kissed her goodnight. The breaking of her glass unicorn, a symbol of her fantasy life, may be seen then as a moment of entry into reality or as the smashing of her only possible world. The tone of the whole play tends to put weight upon the latter construction, but the question is open enough artistically that one acting company spent a week arguing about whether the ending ought to be played for hope or despair. The five students felt so strongly about their different interpretations that they wanted to present their cases to the rest of the class, each side feeling that they could convince the others. As it turned out, the two boys who felt that the gentleman caller had done something good for Laura found the whole class in opposi-</page><page sequence="7">Free, Classless, and Urbane? 537 tion, which amazed but did not discour- age them. Now what difference did it all make? We were all aware that the issue was deeper than "What did Williams in- tend?" The play was enticing us, it seemed, to clarify what we each thought about the way life is. The play touched an area crucial to adolescents: almost every adolescent has in his own secret estimation some crippling feature; to be adolescent is to need legitimization, from your peers especially, and as male or fe- male in particular. The girls in the class had a lot to, say about the tricky gentle- man caller, who, most importantly, did not intend to call again, and was there- fore "leading her on." The culture says that a girl is not a real woman until she has obtained a marriage contract from some man; hence, what good was this brief encounter, no matter how lovely or transforming? Most of the boys agreed- it was "plain common sense." The two rebels without constituency were hand- some All-American types, but far from boorish, and in their view the gentleman caller had performed a service of un- selfish compassion by treating Laura nice- ly, letting her see what she could be, letting her know that the power to be a person as well as a woman was inside of her and nowhere else. He had gotten nothing out of it, in the conventional trade of sex for security. In fact, he was not to be condemned for not offering her security, but applauded for getting away from the whole dishonest game. He was kind, self-confident, a loving guy. Laura was a healthier person for his passing through. I understand more clearly now than then. The girls were angered, and even threatened, because they heard only an- other masculine "line." The culture, which offers little hope, either social or economic, to an unmarriageable girl, re- quires of women both strategy and sus- picion with regard to "gentlemen callers." When the debate had exhausted itself, there was no leftover urge either to write to Tennessee Williams or ask the teacher to arbitrate the matter. Nor was there a feeling that the majority ruled. The am- biguity in that play, was in the play, also in them; thus it spoke to them power- fully, and each person who so heard it had to deal with it as something real. In short, this was no academic matter: it was serious. Ambiguities that matter are always serious business. That is why it is an insult to trivialize both life and art by dealing with ambiguity as a strictly in- ternal matter, between one image and another, as New Critics usually do. IV I would like to conclude by comparing working-class students as literary critics with a recognized critic of liberal vision, Murray Krieger. The work of art that occupied the Third World Literature class was Man's Fate by Andre Malraux, a novel of China in 1927, during a phase of the Chinese Revolution that ended in failure. It concerns psychology and his- tory, the relation of the personal and the political, human subjectivity and will as they interact with objective forces. Krieger starts a discussion of the work in The Tragic Vision by using a quota- tion from Berdyaev: It is worthy of note that the slavery of a man may be the result alike of his being exclusively engulfed by his own ego and concentrated upon his own condition without taking note of the world and other people; and of his being ejected ex- clusively into the external, into the objec- tivity of the world and losing the con- sciousness of his own ego. Both the one</page><page sequence="8">538 COLLEGE ENGLISH and the other are the result of a breach between the subjective and the objective. (p. 50.) In other words what we call human free- dom cannot exist outside of the tension between self and other. Neither side of this tension can be reduced into the other without total distortion. In The Tragic Vision, Krieger main- tains that tragedy is no longer a cathartic vision which restores to harmony a chal- lenged moral order, but an ironic vision which challenges moral order radically without restoration or transcendence. This framework helps Krieger to illumi- nate most of the modern novels he de- scribes, but not Man's Fate, a book about one phase in the most massive and pro- found revolution in world history. A revolution challenges the past moral or- der and transcends that challenge with the assertion of a new moral order. Nec- essarily, to apply "the tragic vision" to Man's Fate, Krieger must find that the human beings who participated in the Revolution did so as slaves, not as people who chose to involve themselves. He must also view the Revolution itself as a stage-managed affair, controlled from above and having little to do with the desires of multitudes. Krieger proceeds to analyze the characters against the melo- dramatic backdrop of a revolution, while my students analyzed the characters in relation to the process of revolution. There is one character on whom Krie- ger's analysis works, because for him the Revolution is merely backdrop. That is Ch'en, a terrorist who has a great drive to suicide which he transforms into a need to die for the Revolution, to "die on the highest possible plane." The tu- dents were very interested in him, a cou- ple of them admiring him greatly as the perfect revolutionary, totally dedicated, ready to "die for his people." But other students talked them out of this view, pointing out as part of their persuasion that, as he did not wish to live for the Revolution, he did not die for it either, but merely used the Revolution for his own psychological needs. "If everyone were that way, you'd never accomplish a revolution." They felt that the tension between the normal desire to live in a revolutionary new society and the will- ingness to die to make that society real was desirable. This tension is present in Kyo, the tac- tical leader of the Shanghai revolt, who also has very intimate relationships with his father, his comrades in the struggle, and his wife. Because life holds these joys for him, the knowledge of his imminent death is painful, and finally he cannot take the suicide pill that would save him from a death by torture. The students decided unanimously, after discussion with each other, that Kyo was the per- fect revolutionary leader. For them, his death was not tragic because, even though he shrank from death personally, part of him-symbolized by his recorded voice-reached out to objective reality, and that part of him had always known that to will his actions in that situation would probably mean death. It did not come to him through his own flaws or errors, or with his own complicity or desire. Death to revolutionary leaders is a normal part of a process, as black stu- dents, at least, are only too well aware. To call it tragic is to see only the per- sonal side of the tension between sub- jective and objective. For Krieger, Kyo, analyzed against the Revolution as backdrop, simply becomes another Ch'en, driven and compulsive- though to do this, Krieger must first con- vict Malraux of losing control over his book, of being unable to project what he clearly intends as a contrast.</page><page sequence="9">Free, Classless, and Urbane? 539 Krieger also makes a Ch'en of Himmel- rich, someone, on the other hand, the students felt they had all known, a guy out of whom all revolutions really come. He is an utterly wretched member of the Shanghai poor, who helps the revolu- tionary leaders hide their materiel during the time of secret planning, but feels a sense of rage and helplessness because he cannot help them fight since his crippled wife and diseased child would die with- out his work. Himmelrich says, "I am a lamppost in the street that everything free in the world pisses on." When his wife and child are killed by the enemy, he is delivered into a state of frenzy that sends him out to kill with joy. At the end we are told that he has escaped to Russia where he works in peace and hap- piness. The students, including two whose families contain ten children each, were delighted with Himmelrich. They said that his feelings as he killed were much more understandable than the psy- chotic Ch'en's. Instead of becoming sick with self-hate and frustration as Ch'en did, it was better to kill your real enemy, your oppressor. This was a liberating act, both psychologically and virtually, so that one might become for the first time peaceful; whereas Ch'en had to go on killing till he died. He could never treat the enemy as a true external because his enemy was so firmly within himself. Once again, the students' careful sense of the relations between subjective and ob- jective is admirable. Here is Krieger on Himmelrich: While all this goes on within him, the blood of his wife and child, splattered everywhere, has been bewitching him, by smell and touch, under his fist as it madly pounds the counter. And as we read of his "frightful intoxication" and of the mixture in him of "horror and satisfac- tion," we must recall Ch'en's description of his own opium-like ecstasy and his confession to Gisors that at the sight of his victim's blood he felt "not only hor- ror." The later description of Himmel- rich engaged in combat leaves no doubt that he has not restrained the violent im- pulses that have been freed to act. I have had to treat Himmelrich at this length in order to establish how com- pletely we can use the terms of Ch'en to explain him. Considered this way, Him- melrich can be shown to point to the split in Malraux between artist and ideologue. The aesthetic imperfections this split leads him into in Man's Fate allow the novel its continuing interest because it develops a metapolitical interest. The Ch'en-like temperament, which I hope will be now conceded to include Himmelrich, can of course not be contained by Marxist doc- trine, canot be satisfied or even appeased by the Communist version of revolution. The "need" that characterizes it is not one that social-political conditions alone create or that a change in these conditions can dissipate, all of which suggests we are dealing with an ontological affair rather than a political one. (Tragic Vision, p. 58.) Why is it that Krieger cannot realize that the killing of Himmelrich's wife and child by the military police was a political act, and that his rage is an appropriate human response to naked injustice, rather than an "opium high" on the smell and feel of human blood? In the liberal im- agination of such critics, called "liberated, civilized, and humane" by Northrop Frye, a revolutionary cannot conceivably be other than demonically possessed and suffering broken connections between his own subjective will and the objective reality of history. A mass revolution be- comes, for such minds, a horde of schizo- phrenic puppets being manipulated by a Party. Why is it impossible for liberal critics to conceive of miserable, oppressed people freely choosing to struggle against their own oppression? A liberal education</page><page sequence="10">540 COLLEGE ENGLISH should enlarge the imagination. What was wrong with Man's Fate for Krieger was not, as he wishes to insist, a matter in- ternal to the work, but a political-phil- osophical disagreement with Malraux-or, perhaps, a fundamental failure to under- stand the political realities Malraux por- trays. The academic system, no less than any other sector of American society, has re- wards and sanctions that shape the prod- uct; since the Cold War began, the mainstream of scholarly effort in every field displays this same attempt to divorce values and ideology from the field and to define ,the advanced study of anything as a body of value-free techniques. The result, of course, is that we are taught capitalist and imperialist ideology dis- guised as technology. The most impor- tant effect of this training is to shape human beings into manipulable objects rather than determiners of meaning and sources of power. Meaning falls outside the realm of education into the private realm or flies upward to be determined by the programmers of your computer- tape. The students and the teachers merely learn how-to-carry out a field study, calculate the GNP, translate a poem into prose, or develop a germ cul- ture that would destroy the world. The liberal at this point would say, "So what else is new? Very few people can really think for themselves (beyond terms set for them) anyhow. That is not capitalism, but human nature." And I would reply, "If that's your view of human nature, then you are quite right to be an ardent capitalist. Like the Grand Inquisitor, you do us all a great good turn by thinking for us. But, of course, you aren't an ardent ist of any sort; you're much too ironic. Do be care- ful to maintain the delicate balance which irony requires, or you might find your- self feeling moral, humane, and rational while performing your pacification ser- vices upon the restless, powerless popu- lace."</page></plain_text>
