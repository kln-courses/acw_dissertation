<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNICATIONS EVOLUTION AND THERMODYNAMICS In an article published some time ago in Science &amp; Society1 Professor Joseph Needham has paid me a high compliment, though seemingly taking issue with me on certain points. It is with particular pleasure that, in compliance with an invitation from the Editor, I take the oppor- tunity to contribute to the discussion which he has initiated in these pages, for in doing so I shall show that my views are much closer to Pro- fessor Needham's than might appear from the isolated passages which he has cited from my Elements of Physical Biology. I shall do this in part by quoting portions from the same book, in part by rounding out the presentation from other sources. I must begin by requoting the passage cited from my book by Pro- fessor Needham, with attention, however, to certain contexts which he has not mentioned. The passage runs: In a vague way this character [of the unlikeness of successive points of time] is indicated by the term progress, which ... is closely associated, in popular conception, with evolution. And the more rigorous scientific disciplines of biology, too, leave us with a not very clearly defined idea of progression as one of the fundamental charac- teristics of those changes which are embraced by the term evolution. Such phrases as "the passage from lower to higher forms" which are often used to describe the direc- tion of evolution, are vague, and undoubtedly contain an anthropomorphic element. At best they give every opportunity for divergence of opinion as to what constitutes a "higher form." If, on the other hand, it is stated that evolution proceeds from simpler to more complex forms, or from less specialized to more specialized forms, then the direction of evolution is but poorly defined, for the rule is at best one with many exceptions. To this Professor Needham remarks: "But this will not do. Denial of the rise in organizational level during evolution (and social evolution, too) is not and cannot be acceptable to biologists." Now the first comment I must make is that the purpose of the passage cited is not to deny progress, but to point out firstly, that progress is not adequately defined, and that therefore the word "progress" cannot form the basis of an adequate or rigorous definition of the direction of evolu- tion; and secondly, more important, to point out that progress as popu- larly understood is not always or necessarily an accompaniment of evolu- tion, as, for instance, when an organism has acquired a parasitic mode of existence or for other reasons has lost some of those very characteristics ivi (194a), p. 366. 161</page><page sequence="2">162 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY which we ordinarily and popularly think of as marks of "higher" organi- zation, e.g., functional eyes lost by certain inhabitants of dark caverns. The point which I have sought to impress both in the portion of the book from which the quotation is taken, and again and again in other sections, is that evolution must be thought of as a phenomenon of the system as a whole of which the organism forms part. The law of evolu- tion, when it shall have been accurately formulated, must be stated in terms of the system as a whole. When so stated it may very well cover cases in which one particular part or species "degenerates" while another part "progresses," if we are to use these rather ill-defined terms at all. An example may serve to illustrate how we must expect an adequate definition of the direction of evolution to be formulated in terms of the system as a whole, not in terms of individual species: survival may be assured either by a relatively high degree of protection against foes, com- bined with relatively low fertility, as is the case with man; or vice versa, a species may survive in spite of high vulnerability of the individual, by being highly prolific, as is the case with certain fishes, etc. Now we might ask, which of these two types of organism will be selected by pref- erence for survival? The question is badly put. They must both survive side by side, for the former are dependent on the latter for their food supply; such organisms survive together as interdependent couples or systems. It is such systems as a whole that have the requisite qualities for survival. Now as to the second law of thermodynamics as the law of evolution. Professor Needham seems to be under the impression that I have sug- gested or endorsed the view that this second law is to be regarded as the law of evolution, defining appropriately and adequately the direction or course of evolution of any system, and in particular the system of nature with its populations of living organisms ("life-bearing system"). That this is not my view is abundantly clear from many portions of my text in the book cited and from some of my other publications. Indeed, on page 30 of my book a section is headed in bold-face type: Inadequacy of Thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics, or to be more specific, the law of increase of entropy, is the law of evolution of certain specific systems, such as isolated systems undergoing physico-chemical transformation. But the passages I have noted make it sufficiently clear that this law has not been put forward as adequate for the description of the course of evolu- tion in the system of the earth and its living inhabitants, which is typi- cally not an isolated system. Quite on the contrary. The earth- to give a concrete illustration- receives energy from the sun at a rate of about 50 horsepower per square inch. On this flood of light life is dependent for its existence. The statement has been clearly made that to formu-</page><page sequence="3">COMMUNICATIONS 163 late adequately the law of evolution for this terrestrial system is a sepa- rate problem, though the case of physico-chemical evolution is well adapted to serve us as a guide in the search for competent formulation. On page 157, I have said: ... The second law of thermodynamics . . . may thus be said to be the law of evolution for a system of this kind [i.e., physico-chemical]. This is a point worth dwell- ing upon inasmuch as a knowledge of the form and character of the law of evolution for this special type of system may be expected to serve as a guide in the search for the law of evolution in the more complicated systems, belonging to an essentially different type, which confront us in the study of organic evolution. . . . Many laws of nature are conveniently expressed ... as minimum (or maximum) laws, and it is to be expected that the law of evolution in life-bearing systems also (where . . . mechanism cannot be lightly waved aside into the convenient catch-all of the laws of thermodynamics) will be found to receive its most convenient expression in this form. In another respect the case of chemical evolution may confidently be expected to be found a good model in the treatment of the broader problem of evolution. It is to be noted that the law of chemical evolution is expressed in terms of the system as a whole. . . . Biologists have rather been in the habit of reflecting upon the evolution of individual species. This point of view does not bear the promise of success if our aim is to find expression for the fundamental law of evolution. We shall probably fare better if we constantly recall that the physical object before us is an undivided system. . . . And on page 327, I have said: . . . The very fact that they [the laws of thermodynamics] hold independently of substance and form lends to their application a catholicity hardly equalled elsewhere in science, and at the same time gives into our hands an instrument of the most extreme economy of thought, since we are relieved, in such, application, of the neces- sity of treating each particular case, with all its complication of detail, on its own merits, but can deal with it by the short-cut of a general formula. Still, the austere virtue of this impartiality [of the second law of thermodynamics] with respect to sub- stance and form, becomes something of a vice when information is sought regarding certain systems in which mechanism plays, not an incidental, but the leading rôle. Here thermodynamics may be found powerless to assist us greatly and the need for new methods may be felt. Finally, I have remarked elsewhere: The strength of Carnot's principle is also its weakness: it holds true [for a revers- ible cycle] independently of the particular mechanism or configuration of the energy transformer (engine) to which it is applied; but for that very reason it is also incom- petent to yield essential information regarding the influence of mechanism upon the course of events. In the ideal case of a reversible heat engine the efficiency is inde- pendent of the mechanism. Real phenomena are irreversible; and in particular, trigger action, which plays so important a rôle in life processes, is a typically irreversible process, the reelase of available energy from a "false" Equilibrium. Here mechanism</page><page sequence="4">164 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY is all important. To deal with problems presented in these cases requires the intro- duction, into the argument, of new principles. And the principle competent to extend our systematic knowledge in this field seems to be; found in the principle of the sur- vival of the fittest . . . thus the principle of natural selection makes its entry into dynamics . . . [and] is competent to yield information beyond the scope of thermo- dynamics.2 Regarding the nature of the mechanisms (energy transformers) in- volved in organic evolution, and for some indication of the new methods that must be developed for the treatment of the problems to which they give rise, the reader must be referred to the later chapters of the Ele- ments of Physical Biology, which elaborate the statement on page 338: "The mechanism ... or apparatus by which behavior is adapted to cir- cumstances is here not an incidental detail to be lightly dismissed as of secondary importance, but must occupy the very center of attention." A word on the extension of the concept of irreversibility. This con- cept has been introduced into the discussion of evolution for the purpose of identifying the "forward" direction in time on an objective basis, that is, in order to distinguish evolution from mere history or changeful se- quence? So evolution has been defined as "the history of a system under- going irreversible changes/' this definition leaning on the physicist's con- ception of irreversibility. As developed in physics, this conception is not free from difficulties, of which some hint has been given by me on page 24 ff. of Elements of Physical Biology. But in relation to organic evolution the concepts of reversibility and irreversibility, in a broader sense than that familiar in physics, proves to be of particular interest. The physicist has been interested in systems in which irreversibility is associated fundamentally with phenomena on a molecular scale- equalization of temperature, diffusion of gases, and the like. Two gases will mix spontaneously, but they do not separate spontaneously. In mix- ing they can by suitable devices be made to yield work; conversely, they can be separated only by processes involving the expenditure of energy, the doing of work. This is typical of "irreversible" processes. But there is also a species of irreversibility on a macroscopic scale, which plays an important rôle in the operations of living organisms. Certain materials required for life tend to become dissipated, scattered 2 A. J. Lotka, "Natural Selection as a Physical Principle," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vm, (1922), p. 152 and 153. Similar conceptions have, also been independently put forward by H. Guilleminot, whose untimely decease abridged his opportunities to gain adequate recognition. Passages pertinent to the present discussion will be found in his Nouveaux horizons de la science, rv (Paris, 1916); and La matière et la vie (Paris, 1919); see especially p. 118 of the latter, et passim. « See the present author's Elements of Physical Biology (Baltimore, 1925), p. 24.</page><page sequence="5">COMMUNICATIONS 165 and shuffled in nature: a spontaneous process. The organism needs them in sufficiently concentrated and isolated form. To effect the re- quired processes of concentration and sorting requires work, which or- ganisms, and in particular man, are specially „adapted to do. In fact their survival in greater or less numbers depends on the perfection of their equipment (sense and motor organs, receptors, effectors and ad- justors) for effecting these concentrating and sorting operations. It is very largely with these concentrating and sorting operations of the living organism that the statistical dynamics of organic evolution must be concerned. To quote once more: In dealing with the physics of such macroscopically irreversible effects it will be necessary to develop a method of mathematical analysis that will be competent to handle not only the extremes - the case of a primitive organism that can deal only in the gross, with little or no intelligent or other discrimination, with the matter and situations presented to it; and an ideally perfect organism, that should expend just the minimum of effort, directed with absolute precision toward the attainment of its ends. A method must be devised that shall duly take account of, and use as a funda- mental datum for its déductions, the particular character, the particular degree of perfection of the mechanical and psychic equipment or organization by which each organism reacts more or less selectively upon' its environment. The situation here encountered differs in an important respect from that in the statistical mechanics of the systems contemplated in thermo- dynamics. As I have remarked elsewhere: The Demon imagined by Clark Maxwell, who could sort out molecules and defeat the second law, is a mythological creature. But in the world of baseball dimensions, say, we are all Maxwell Demons, of somewhat varied dexterity. In approaching the study of the field thus opened to our view, the investigation of the course of evolution in a system comprising living organisms, we shall need to haul the Maxwell Demon from his obscure corner in the museum of scientific freaks, out into the limelight at the center of the stage. It is not a matter of impertinent academic speculation what a mythical Maxwell Demon might do in a world of molecules, but on the contrary it is a matter most pertinent to the business of life to investigate what actually does happen to a multitudinous population of Maxwell Demons of graded discriminating powers, who are thrown together in cutthroat competition in this very real world in which our lot is cast.* The quotations thus presented from my prior publications should suffice to show that it was by no means my intent to proclaim the laws of thermodynamics as alone adequate to describe or predict the course of events in a system in the process of organic evolution. But while something more than the discipline of thermodynamics may be needed for the adequate development of the physics of organic evolution, this 4 Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences, xrv (1914), p. 352.</page><page sequence="6">166 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY does not imply that the action of living organisms necessarily infringes the laws of thermodynamics. It must be remembered that the prin- ciple of increasing entropy applies specifically to an isolated system. Neither the individual organism nor the system of organic nature as a whole is an isolated system. The individual receives a steady stream of energy in the form of food, and the system as a whole is exposed to a con- stant flood of energy in the form of sunlight. There is no question here of an isolated system, and in these circumstances there is no conflict with the laws of thermodynamics if in certain portions of the system there is decrease of entropy, selecting and discriminating processes tending to produce order out of disorder, tending to sort rather than to shuffle. In fact, as has been pointed out above, such sorting activities are character- istic of living organisms. It may be appropriate if I outline here briefly the conception of evolu- tion which seems to me to be suitable for the systematic development of the physics of organic evolution. The object which we have before us for study is a vast system compris- ing a great number of components- the several species of living organ- isms-which within themselves are relatively homogeneous, but which differ from one another in discontinuous fashion, so that the system as a whole is a heterogeneous assembly of these relatively homogeneous parts. It contains in addition certain other parts, commonly thought of and spoken of as the inanimate environment. Now the distribution of the total matter of nature among the several components of this system is not fixed, but is undergoing continual change. It is essentially the change in this distribution that constitutes the evolution of the system. Here a species is growing in numbers, and there another is contracting, and, in some instances, becoming extinct, disappearing from the scene. Furthermore, each species within itself is only relatively homogeneous. Its members are similar, but not identi- cal in form and behavior. Hence within each species a redistribution is in general taking place, certain types becoming more abundant, others falling off, and, again, in some instances, disappearing. Over long pe- riods this change in composition within the species may proceed to such an extent that the descendents of an early generation may differ so far from their distant progenitors as to be recognized as a different species, since, in actual observation by us human beings of the present era, the intervening links are not presented to our view. But the thing to note is that the process by which the result has come about it appropriately regarded and described as a process of redistribution of matter among the components of one system. Now this way of viewing the process of organic evolution is fruitful in several ways. We recognize at once that in general form it is identi-</page><page sequence="7">COMMUNICATIONS 167 cal with the point of view of chemical dynamics which studies the laws governing the distribution and redistribution of matter among the com- ponents (elements, compounds, phases) of a physico-chemical system. But we also note at once a fundamental difference. A system in physico- chemical transformation (evolution) is restricted to a rather closely limited scope of possible states. For example a system composed of hy- drogen and oxygen can contain these elements as such or in combination as water, in varying proportions, within limits determined by its initial state. We shall not, for example, at some future date find part of the system converted into nitrogen, or sodium chloride, etc. The possible transformations are rather narrowly limited. Organic evolution on the other hand is only in minor degree a matter of change in chemical composition. It is mainly a matter of change in form or structure. And the possible changes in form are infinite. Thus it comes about that a system in physico-chemical transformation, under given conditions, progresses towards one definite state, often reached within a short space of time5; organic evolution, on the contrary, is probably competent to continue indefinitely through all time under a given set of conditions. Physico-chemical evolution is typically of a proc- ess that terminates. Organic evolution is probably a process without end,6 except in so far as external conditions- the ultimate dissipation of the sun's energy- set a limit to it. The limit is, however, far remote in time; Jeans7 estimates that the requisite conditions for life on earth will continue (aside from unforeseen astronomical accidents) for some- thing of the order of a million million years, or perhaps about a thousand times the duration of life on earth up to this day. In the meanwhile, in the light stream flowing to us from the sun, there is time for countless generations of continued organic evolution, before the evening of all life on earth sets in. There is nothing even apparently in conflict with the physical laws known to us, in the tem- porary increase of organization- unshuffling- while yet it is day. With the coming of the solar night all these sorting or unshuffling processes will cease, as they depend for their continuance on a source of available energy. Our position in the study of organic evolution differs in an important, though in a sense accidental respect, from that in the study of physical evolution. In the latter it is the collective phenomena (pressure, tem- 5 That is, for all practical purposes. Theoretically the end state may never be fully attained, but only approached to within negligible distance. 6 Compare A. J. Lotka, Théorie analytique des associations biologiques.

Organic evolution we study as it were from inside, through the acci- dent that we are ourselves units of the same scale of magnitude as the other units (living organisms) of the system. Accordingly these units themselves and their activities are relatively easy of access for our direct observation, and it is when we come to enquire into collective effects that we have to resort to special methods. Whereas in our treatment of physico-chemical systems the law of evolution is given as a fundamental principle, applied to collective effects (pressure, volume, temperature, chemical composition, etc.), in our enquiry regarding organic evolution it is primarily the actions of individuals that are our data, and if the law of evolution is to be expressed in terms of collective effects (as we may surmise from our experience with problems in physico-chemical dynam- ics), these collective effects must be deduced secondarily from our knowl- edge of individual actions. As Bertrand Russell8 has remarked: "Every living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as pos- sible of its environment into itself and its seed." But this observation of the activity of each individual leaves us with a blank: Since they all strive in this direction, and since they evidently cannot all transform the entire environment into their own kind, but must compete for its substance, what then determines the collective effect of all these striv- ings, what determines the resulting distribution of matter among the competitors? It has been noted that a fundamental condition for terrestrial life is the flow of a stream of available energy from the sun. This fact must inevitably enter into the formulation of the law of organic evolution. I have elsewhere9 put forward the surmise that the direction of evolution is such as to tend to make the flux of energy through the system of or- ganic nature a maximum. This surmise is based on the fact that plants predominantly anabolic, tend, in spreading over the globe, to increase the energy absorbed by organic nature per unit of time, while the advent and extension of animals, with their more pronounced catabolic activi- ties, tended to increase the energy dissipated per unit of time. It is as if a reservoir were put in the path of an abundant stream, and both the inlet and outlet of the reservoir were enlarged, thus increasing the flow through it. The rigorous proof of this or some cognate principle remains to be 8 An Outline of Philosophy (London, 1927), p. «7. » Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, vra (19a*), p. 147 and 191.</page><page sequence="9">COMMUNICATIONS 169 established.10 Perhaps photochemistry has something to teach us in this enquiry. It also deals with systems exposed to a stream of energy, and one important feature of such systems is that the end-result is dependent on the structure of the system, i.e., on the presence of catalysts.11 However this may be, it is evident that in any adequate dynamics of organic evolution a dominant rôle must be assigned to those structures which determine primarily the differential survival of the various organ- isms, and which thus secondarily determine the collective phenomenon of the distribution of matter in the system. Structure alone, however, is of course insufficient fully to describe the living organism in its rela- tion to the environment. The mathematical treatment of the problem introduces another concept, the behavior schedule, which defines how the organism of a given species, on an average, distributes the energy ex- pended by it, among the several activities of which it is capable. This behavior schedule must, at this stage, be given as a fundamental datum, a characteristic of the species.12 This may appear like begging a fundamental question. In our own behavior schedule we recognize many of our reactions on the environ- ment as voluntary acts. We quite commonly assume that similar reac- tions of those organisms, at any rate, which approach most closely our own, habitus, also involve voluntary acts. In introducing the behavior schedule as an ultimate datum of our problem, we have disregarded this. We have deliberately evaded mention of the phenomenon of will as it enters into our own behavior, and presumably, in some form, into the be- havior of other organisms. The phenomenon of will seems extraneous to the universe of physics. We may turn page after page of any treatise on physics without encoun- tering any reference to it. Yet physics has something to tell us about will. First we note that will refers to the future. Willed events are neces- sarily future events. One can wish, but one cannot will about the past. Closely related to this is the fact that willed actions can and do occur 10 W. D. Bancroft and others havd suggested the application of the principle of Le Chatelier to organic systems. This, however, does not bear critical examination. See A. J. Lotka, American Journal of Hygiene, in, (1923), p. 355; Proceedings of the Amer- ican Academy of Arts and Sciences, lvii (1922), p. 21; also Elements of Physical Biology, p. 281 ff. 11 Unlike ordinary chemical equilibrium, photochemical equilibrium (more exactly stationary state) can be shifted by the addition of a catalyst. 12 The behavior schedule is, like structure, subject to the principle of the survival of the fittest, in the sense that a species with an inappropriate behavior schedule will lose out in the struggle for survival. For details on this and related points the reader must be referred to the author's Elements of Physical Biology, especially ch. 24 ff.</page><page sequence="10">170 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY only in structures having at their disposal a fund of free or available energy, structures in this sense unstable. Now an unstable system is one whose future is likely to differ from its present state in a determinate way. Thus an unstable system contains in itself a presage of the future. And will is precisely that: a foreknowledge of future events of which the cause resides in us. It is because this knowledge comes to us directly, and not through the mediation of our special sense organs, that it does not ordinarily figure in the subject-matter of physics, which is built on knowledge gained through our organs of special sense. It is a remark- able fact that the edifice of modern physics can thus be erected exclu- sively on the basis of the "public" knowledge accessible to all through sense organs, and without explicit reference to that "private" knowledge which is not thus accessible. But even in the realm of social and economic phenomena much can be deduced without taking into account the caprice with which the individual seemingly decides one single action. This is because, statistically, groups of individuals tend to follow a pattern, as pointed out years ago by Quetelet, and recognized as a necessity for sur- vival by Herbert Spencer. As for economics, Cournot in his classical Researches into the Theory of Wealth identifies demand with sales (excluding from discussion individual desires as such), for "we do not see for what reason theory need take account of any demand which does not result in a sale."13 It may not be without deeper significance that in modern physical theory also, "caprice" seems to enter into certain individual effects, while only gross averages become sensible to ordinary observation. It may well be expected that when the physical sciences are developed to embrace comprehensively in their scope events comprising the action of living or- ganisms, the rather arbitrary exclusion of data obtained as "private" knowledge will be lifted.14 But even at the present stage the phenome- non of will has recognizable relations to physical principles, and is sub- ject to physical limitations. The fundamental fact that all willed action falls within the restrictions of physical law gives us justification for seeking a formulation of the law of organic evolution in terms of physical entities. This is far from saying, however, that the laws of thermodynamics alone are competent for such formulation. It is not a denial of increas- ing organization nor indeed a categorical statement of any kind. It is ISA. Cournot, Researches into the Theory of Wealth (1838).
