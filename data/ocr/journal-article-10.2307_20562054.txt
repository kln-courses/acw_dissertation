<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOKVIEW People of the Wetlands - Bogs, Bodies and Lake Dwellers: A World Survey. B. Coles andJ. Coles. Thames and Hudson. 1989.. Hardback. ?17.95 stg. This most attractive book on the wetlands archaeology is a considerable elaboration on an earlier book, The Archaeology of Wetlands edited by John Coles and Andrew Lawson and published by Edinburgh University Press in 1984. It is aptly described as 'A World Survey' and it is probably in this that its greatest value lies. It assembles a vast body of information from around the world derived from a multiplicity of often obscure and relatively inaccessible sources. Data connected with most, if perhaps not all, aspects of wetland studies is presented in highly readable prose accompanied by a particularly successful combination of photographs and drawings. It is a book which should have appeal for a general readership as well as being extremely useful to the professional archaeologist. A considerable section of the book traces the development of wetland archaeology through time,. Unfortunately, nowhere does it attempt to consider a more general philosophy or the precise nature and role of this discipline, if such it is. The unique value of this area of study is probably blindingly obvious to anyone who is heavily involved in it. However, I feel that some definition of its distinctiveness would benefit the outsider who might perhaps wonder at the rationale behind assembing sites and objects of diverse origin and date, united only by their wetness! Relatively scant attention is paid to riverine evidence, although admittedly the title does not purport to include it. Likewise, there are few references to the contribution of underwater archaeology to this or other aspects of the subject. For the Irish reader, however, there are very useful sections on recent work at Moynagh Lough crannog and the Corlea trackways for example, although the inclusion of sites in the text generally is fairly selective. Ballinderry crannog, for instance, hardly figures and the Lough Gara sites not at all. The book suffers from having a rather sparse index. While most Irish provenancing is precise there are some errors of spelling and location, the most serious of which is the placing of Ralaghan in Co. Cork. The wooden figure of Iron Age date from the townland of that name in Co. Cavan is quite at home in the northern midlands with its strong tradition of anthropomorphic carving in stone but would be something of a sensation in Co. Cork! Nontheless, these are all minor criticisms and I have no hesitation in recommending this book as a fascinating assemblage of archaeological information from an impressive diversity of sources. Other considerations apart, it is quite simply an enjoyable book to read, most effectively and in some cases very dramatically illustrated.
