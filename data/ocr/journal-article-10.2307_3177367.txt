<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bauhaus Theater of Human Dolls Juliet Koss But when I attempt to survey my task, it is clear to me that I should speak to you not of people, but of things.-Rainer Maria Rilke, 19071 In 1961, Walter Gropius grandly declared that "the Bauhaus embraced the whole range of visual arts: architecture, plan- ning, painting, sculpture, industrial design, and stage work."2 While the statement is not inaccurate, the straightforward inclusion of theater as one of six fundamental components of the visual arts belies the field's more complicated status at the Bauhaus. Gropius had not mentioned theater in the initial manifesto and program of the State Bauhaus in Weimar, the four-page pamphlet published in April 1919 that proclaimed, "Architects, painters, sculptors, we must all return to the crafts!"3 But stage work soon became central, and theater proved to be a form of art that unified all the others; already in 1922, a drawing by Paul Klee of the idea and structure of the Bauhaus shows "Bau und Biihne," or building and stage, firmly united at its core (Fig. 1). The Bauhaus held perfor- mances frequently and sponsored many in other venues, causing delight and, intermittently, disturbing the neighbors. The theater workshop, created in the summer of 1921 and overseen initially by Lothar Schreyer, is associated most closely with Oskar Schlemmer-who ran it from early 1923 until his departure in 1929-and particularly with his Triadic Ballet, first performed in full in 1922.4 Theater was also the subject of the fourth of the fourteen Bauhaus books, Die Biihne im Bauhaus (The stage at the Bauhaus), which ap- peared in 1925.5 When the Dessau Bauhaus was built that year, the auditorium was located near the center of the building's triadic pinwheel, between the entrance hall and the canteen, as if to indicate theater's pivotal status within the school's social and professional life. The study of theater is often impeded by the nature of the medium: notoriously difficult to document and theoretically unruly, it falls easily between disciplines while claiming to incorporate them all. This amorphous quality gained partic- ular significance at the Bauhaus, where experiments in stage and theater design took place both on and off the premises, frequently in the context of costume parties and other festiv- ities. In all of its incarnations, Bauhaus performances re- created the human body-literally and symbolically, onstage and off-in the shape of the doll, its childlike simplicity combining a comforting and seemingly animate charm with an unnerving absence of human personality. Bauhaus dolls of various kinds maintained a playful ambivalence in the face of shifting models of subjectivity, toying with gender ambiguity and engaging with the notion of abstraction both at the level of the individual subject and as a unified group of creatures, delightfully difficult to differentiate. Vessels of empathy and estrangement, they expressed and encouraged a reciprocal relationship between performers and spectators, increasingly exemplifying the bond between gender and mass culture, to provide models of mass spectatorship for the Weimar Re- public. "The history of the theater is the history of the transfigu- ration of human form," Schlemmer asserted in 1925, with "the human being as the actor of physical and spiritual events, alternating between naivete and reflection, natural- ness and artificiality."6 Such contradictory attributes often appeared simultaneously on the Bauhaus stage, where per- formances combined human subjectivity and its deadpan absence, as seen in a black-and-white photograph taken by Erich Consemiller of Schlemmer's Space Dance in 1926 (Fig. 2). Three figures pose on an otherwise bare stage in padded monochrome unitards indistinguishable in everything but (presumably) color; their feet, in standard-issue dance slip- pers, appear dainty and petite below their stuffed bodies; and identical masks encase their heads in shiny metallic ovoids painted with wide-eyed expressions of mock surprise. Three hands near the center of the image mark the only areas of visible human flesh, but even these look so rigid as to evoke those of shopwindow mannequins; the calculated angles of the dancers' arms and legs likewise suggest synthetic limbs. Facing frontally or in profile, the perfectly poised figures lack all trace of individuality, any sense of flesh and blood, or any hint of human skeletons at their core; they seem devoid even of a generic human personality. Their padded bodies, partic- ularly at the hips and crotch, appear female. Underneath the costumes, however, lurk Schlemmer himself (in front on the left) and the dancers Werner Siedhoff and Walter Kaminsky. Conflating "naivete and reflection, naturalness and artificial- ity"-to invoke Schlemmer's terms-they playfully embody a model of human subjectivity that reflects the instability of their era. The unitards and masks resemble the protective gear of fencers; the poses call to mind the fencing ring or dance studio.7 But despite the initial impression they give of active athleticism, the figures also seem like passive objects. They hold static, almost timeless postures, like modern parodies of the statues of ancient Greece that Johann Joachim Winckel- mann had famously characterized by a "noble simplicity and a calm greatness, as much in the pose as in the expression."8 The figure on the right especially, with its simplified forms and its arms tucked invisibly behind its back, evokes a ruin with missing limbs and weathered features. "The artificial figure permits any movement, any position for any desired duration," Schlemmer explained, "it permits-an artistic de- vice from the periods of the greatest art-the variable scale of the figures: significant large, insignificant small."9 Without human faces or individualized bodies, the figures in Space Dance are easily read as miniature humans, although the padding enlarges their forms. Comforting and disturbing in equal measure, they simultaneously resemble children's toys</page><page sequence="2">BAUHAUS THEATER OF HUMAN DOLLS 725 1 Paul Klee, the idea and structure of the Bauhaus, 1922. Berlin, Bauhaus- Archiv expanded to adult size and oddly overstuffed little people, in keeping with Schlemmer's declaration in 1930 that represen- tations of the human figure belonged "in the realm of the doll-like."'l The photograph's uncertainty of scale is mean- while intensified by the absence of anything else onstage with which to compare the figures, effectively rendering each one an unreliable standard for judging the other two. Receding upstage from left to right, they become smaller, but their heads remain at the same height. Within the image, the choreography leaves no doubt that the intended spectator is in fact the camera lens; Schlem- mer's careful arrangement of the figures onstage coincides precisely with Consemuller's photographic composition. Symmetrically arranged within the frame, shining out from the center of the surrounding darkness, the three heads divide the photograph vertically into four equal areas and horizontally into three, with the dark space behind them- the blank backdrop behind the stage-comprising the top two-thirds of the picture. The bodies are arranged in space, but the image reads as flat; only the straight, deep shadows linking Schlemmer's feet to the center of the horizon line (and the shorter, parallel shadows behind the other figures' feet) suggest recession into depth. The three vertical bod- ies-and the limbs attached to them-likewise divide the image like the lines of a geometry diagram, despite the figures' apparent difference in size and arbitrary poses. A painted line down the center of the stage floor also bisects the photograph vertically; interrupted by the feet of the central figure (Siedhoff), it continues along his body and through Schlemmer's outstretched hand to end at Siedhoffs artificial head. But Siedhoff's head is also Schlemmer's: iden- tical to that worn by the director, it is made according to his design. These representations of the human figure in the late 1920s-both the stage image and the photograph-test the limits of recent art historical scholarship in the United States on Weimar subjectivity. Scholarship in this field has concen- trated on Dada imagery, robots, and other technological creatures, frequently emphasizing disjuncture of various kinds, from the aesthetics of montage to the prevalence of dismembered bodies in the wake of World War I.1 Following the arguments of the artists themselves, formal disjuncture is often aligned with the politics of resistance, the visible mon- tage fragment treated as a marker of the "real" that questions the logic of representation and thus acts as a destabilizing force in the political, cultural, and social realms.12 Such an</page><page sequence="3">726 ART BUILLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOIUME I.XXXV NUMBER 4 2 Oskar Schlemmer, Space Dance, performed by Schlemmer, Werner Siedhoff, and Walter Kaminsky, Dessau Bauhaus, 1926, photograph by Erich Consemuller.

A collation of partial, mismatched, roughly torn images from contemporary magazines, Dompteuse shows various accoutrements of control from the circus arena and public life, challenging prevailing notions of idealized feminine beauty and troubling the rela- tion between tamer and tamed.13 The equation's inverse- that an aesthetic "return to order" signifies political conser- vatism-is often equally powerful, with positive images of physical wholeness and the healthy body produced as Na- tional Socialist propaganda, as in Leni Riefenstahl's two-part film Olympia of 1938.14 Particularly in contrast to the gritty photomontages ofJohn Heartfield and Hoch or the political theater of Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator, it may be tempting to read Schlemmer's creatures, Consemiller's photograph, and Bauhaus dolls generally as ominous harbingers of the National Socialist obsession with physical culture and rationalized subjectivity. Whether openly celebratory of such tendencies or simply blind to political reality, the dolls (by this line of thinking) are, at best, liable to co-optation by right-wing forces; at worst, their physical amplitude and seemingly apolitical posturing prove their guilt. Insistently whole-more than whole-they seem optimistically to embrace the mounting mechanization of Weimar Germany; their robotic poses softened, literally, by their costumes, they stave off the threat of dismemberment with a denial both charming and disquieting. Three more figures, standing proudly with linked arms in Consemiiller's photograph of Schlemmer's Gesture Dance III in 1927, might be cited as further evidence (Fig. 4). Like a trio of padded fops, Schlemmer, Siedhoff, and Kaminsky here are buried in costumes resembling tuxedos, ostensibly useless spectacles</page><page sequence="4">BAUHAUS THEATER OF HUMAN DOLLS 727 5 Schlemmer, design for the congress hall in the Deutsches Museum, Munich (Pastel fur einen Wettbewerb), detail, colored chalk on writing paper, 1934.

In fact, no amount of padding could protect the inhabi- tants of the Bauhaus from continuous charges of communist leanings, with their festivities cited as evidence of political radicalism. The Ministry of Culture in Weimar responded to allegations in 1920, for example, that the school was "sparta- cistic and bolshevistic," noting that "a complaint has been 4 Schlemmer, Gesture Dance III (Bauhaustinze: Gestentanz), 1927, photograph by Consemuller.

But despite such ongoing victimization, ample connections exist between the Bauhaus and National Socialism, as recent schol- arship attests.17 Schlemmer's approving citation of Josef Goebbels in a letter of June 1933 reveals both his own polit- ical bent and his sense of the convergence of his life and work: "I consider myself pure, and my art strong," he de- clared, "in keeping with nat. soc. principles-namely 'heroic, steely-romantic, unsentimental, hard, sharp, clear, creative of new types,' etc." And one need look no further than Schlem- mer's design, the following year, for a mural for the congress hall in the Deutsches Museum, Munich, to witness the chill- ing offspring of his earlier dolls (Fig. 5).l8 Roughly sketched in blue and purple chalk, an orderly litter of identical, dark blond women stand in profile, their right arms raised in a Nazi salute. Hailing a greater power that lies beyond our sight, they are unified in a grid of support-although the feminine silhouette of their flowing, floor-length skirts sug- gests a return toJugendstil ideals following the androgynous padding of their 1920s forebears. But while such textual and visual evidence reveals much about Schlemmer in 1933 and 1934, it proves little about the figures he designed in the 1920s.

Insistently refusing to postulate a firm stance of any kind, the dolls seem instead to express the profound patience described by Siegfried Kracauer in 1922: Perhaps the only remaining attitude is one of waiting. By committing oneself to waiting, one neither blocks one's path toward faith (like those who defiantly affirm the void) nor besieges this faith.... One waits, and one's waiting is a hesitant openness, albeit of a sort that is difficult to ex- plain.20 In light of these words, one might view the extraordinary static poses of Schlemmer's theater dolls-their noble sim- plicity and calm greatness-as uncertain, expectant, and hopeful. Seriously playful creatures, construction sites of modern subjectivity, they might even be seen to embody the synthesis of "the most extreme fantasy with the most extreme sobriety" with which the art critic Franz Roh characterized the technique of photomontage itself in 1925.21 Waxworks, dolls, marionettes, and puppets had long sub- stituted for humans in the German literary imagination, fa- mously appearing in the work of E. T. A. Hoffmann and Heinrich von Kleist in the early nineteenth century. "Grace," Kleist decreed in 1810, "appears purest simultaneously in the human body that has either none at all or else infinite consciousness-that is, in the puppet or god."22 Such artifi- cial creatures gravitated easily to the stage. In late-nineteenth- century France, for example, Leo Delibes's ballet Coppelia (1870) andJacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann (1881) took up these literary precursors, their leading char- acters melding mechanization and the performance of fem- ininity as if testing a new model of female subjectivity. Replica humans-and female dolls in particular-pervaded the visual arts of early-twentieth-century Germany, from the paintings of the Blaue Reiter to Hans Bellmer's creations and photo- graphs. Such treatments of the relation between subjectivity and objectification occurred with particular fervor after the birth of visual abstraction, as they permitted the continued investigation of human subjectivity despite the demise of figurative painting. "At a certain point in time," as Walter Benjamin declared in the allusive, telegraphic prose charac- teristic of his Arcades project, "the motif of the doll acquires a sociocritical significance."23 At the Bauhaus, dolls of a traditional size were created as well, such as the marionettes designed by Kurt Schmidt for The Adventures of the Little Hunchback and pictured in Die Bihne im Bauhaus in 1925 (Fig. 6).24 They performed in private and in public, acting as scale models for theater costumes and as miniature people, manipulated by human hands and enjoyed by human spectators. Between 1916 and 1925, Paul Klee created for his son, Felix, a puppet theater with fifty mario- nettes, including a self-portrait and a "matchbox genie" (Fig. 7). As Felix later reminisced with regard to these creatures, "some hilarious performances were held at the Weimar Bau- haus, during which various confidential matters were aired in an unsparing and sarcastic way, vexing to those concerned and highly amusing to the others."25 Blending child's play with serious adult activity, performances could serve both as entertainment and as psychological ventilation along the model of Sigmund Freud's "talking cure." The playfulness of the dolls made by Klee and others in this period suggests a determination to reenchant the world, in keeping with Schlemmer's lament that, outside the Bauhaus, "the materi- alistic-practical age has certainly lost the genuine feeling for play and wonder. The utilitarian frame of mind is well on the way to killing it."26 Proudly bearing the marks of their mak- ers' hands, dolls embodied the drive to unify art and craft that governed the Bauhaus in its early years. After 1923, however, with the arrival at the school of Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy-and increasingly after the move to Dessau- technology became the guiding force of Bauhaus creativity, and theater provided an ideal showcase for contending with the body's increasing reification, mechanization, and androg- yny.27 "The integration of humans into stage production must not be burdened by the tendency to moralize, nor by any ... INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMATIC," Moholy-Nagy argued.28 As if in response, the small, playful objects at the Bauhaus-toys, essentially-grew to human size; their transformation accom- panied a change in status, transforming Bauhauslers into their counterparts on stage. Despite borrowing conceptual authority from their Romantic antecedents, Bauhaus dolls (after the school's initial years) were not marionettes con- trolled by someone who, as Kleist had written, ideally "imag- ines himself at the puppet's center of gravity" to create "the path of the dancer's soul" in the movement of its limbs.29 The Bauhaus director was now more likely to perform as a doll than to hold its strings behind the scenes. Creator and per- former became theoretically interchangeabte, dissolving the fundamental distinction between them that the traditional theater maintained both physically and conceptually. And, as performers took on the guise of passive objects, spectators- implicitly-were increasingly rendered their equals. Unlike the puppet or marionette, the automaton-a ma- chine figure operating as if human, without need of human</page><page sequence="6">BAUHAUS THEATER OF HUMAN DOLLS 729 assistance-more closely approximates the model of the Bau- haus doll. From the Renaissance to the late nineteenth cen- tury, automata had enchanted audiences throughout Europe with mechanical ingenuity and magical performances, dem- onstrating the wondrous qualities of the modern machine while confirming the mechanistic nature of the human body.30 A Swiss writing automaton from 1773, capable of reproducing a short sentence on a sheet of paper, may be taken as representative (Fig. 8). An astounding replica of human capabilities, it embodies a humanist conception of individuality: civilized, educated, and unique. In his book Machine Man of 1747, Julien Offrey de La Mettrie described the activity of spectatorship as a physical reflex. "We take everything-gestures, accents, etc.-from those we live with," he wrote, "in the same way as the eyelid blinks under the threat of a blow that is foreseen, or as the body of the spectator imitates mechanically, and despite himself, all the movements of a good mime."31 Immersed in the perfor- mance, a spectator cannot resist imitating a performer's movements, even those of an inanimate automaton. Figura- tively speaking, the relationship is reciprocal. Just as a spec- tator mimics the actions of the performer, the latter imitates its spectators, reflecting contemporaneous conceptions of what it means to be human. "Automata represent the dream, the ideal form, the utopia of the machine,"Jean-Claude Beaune has argued, "the gauge of their absolute perfection is their independence, which endows them from the first with an anthropomorphic or living quality."32 Like the human model on which it was based, the automaton was essentially individualistic. A sugges- tion of technical replication combined with the magic of irreproducibility; both as a mechanical invention and as a human substitute, the measure of its success was its unique- ness. "It is often possible to discern some temptation toward group activity" within an automaton, Beaune allows, "but not yet to such an extent as to affect its insularity."33 Individual performers in Space Dance and Gesture Dance, their gestures stiff and machinelike, almost pass for overgrown, padded automata. But despite the morphological resemblance, the model of subjectivity they embody is very different: they belong implicitly within a group of identical creatures. Indi- vidual automata would seem to have continued to captivate the Weimar cultural imagination, exemplified, perhaps, by the character Maria in Fritz Lang's film Metropolis, released in early 1927, but even she, as a prototype for later replicas ("we will put one in every factory!"), represents the wondrous potential of serial production. So, too, does the Steel R.U.R. Automaton (Fig. 9). The letters emblazoned on his steel chest stand for "Rossum's Universal Robots," referring to the 1921 play of that title by Karel Capek, who introduced the term robot in its pages. By the 1920s, German stages were well prepared for such creatures. The weakened authority of narrative, the disap- pearance of bourgeois characters on view in the privacy of their own drawing rooms, and the dismantling of the invisible "fourth wall" dividing the stage and auditorium-all provided evidence of the demise of naturalism in the theater, as in literature and the visual arts.34 In Germany and Russia, in particular, performances increasingly emphasized nonrepre- sentational movement; Schlemmer's Gesture Dance may thus 7 Klee, Matchbox Genie, matchboxes, feather, 1924. Bern, Klee Museum (from Paul Klee: Puppen, Plastiken, Reliefs, Masken, Theater, 81; ? VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2003) be seen to stand at the intersection of modern dance and theater as both art forms sought to abandon naturalism, and its attendant psychologist impulses, in favor of abstraction.35 "The theater, the world of appearances, is digging its own grave when it tries for verisimilitude," Schlemmer asserted in 1922, citing Hoffmann and Kleist with approbation.36 Mo- holy-Nagy also embraced theatrical abstraction. While com- mending the Futurists, Expressionists, and Dadaists for help- ing theater to overturn naturalism's "predominance of values based exclusively on logic and ideas," he criticized their reliance on figures based on subjective emotional effects and literary models, demanding instead that a new abstract hu- man be developed for the stage.37 Rather than resting at the top of the theatrical hierarchy, central to the activities on-</page><page sequence="7">730 ART BUIIl ETIN )ECEMBER 2003 VO()UME I.XXXV NUMBER 4 8 Pierre-Jacquet Droze and Jean-Frederic Leschot, writing automaton, 1773. Mus6e d'Art et d'Histoire, Neuchatel, Switzerland stage, this new model would remain, as he put it, "OF EQUAL VALUE TO TIHE OTHER CREATIVE MEANS."38 Performers at the Bauhaus were to be rendered abstract both at the level of the individual figure and in groups; such traditional versions of the mechanized body as the automaton would be replaced with a new model, infinitely replicable and potentially uni- versal. Bauhaus dolls echoed the radical transfiguration of the human subject in early-twentieth-century Germany, when an emphasis on Sachlichkeit, or objectivity, joined the potentially universal "urge to abstraction" described by the young art historian Wilhelm Worringer in 1908.3% Following World War I, neue Sachlichkeit, or new objectivity, delivered a new crea- ture, one that has been termed posthumanist; drained of psychological autonomy, this Weimar subject-visible in such works as Raoul Hausmann's The Engineers of 1920-retained only a lingering pretence of humanist individuality (Fig. 10).40 With standardized clothing, bodies, and faces, the engineers present an image of studied efficiency and anonymous unifor- mity, an effect reinforced by the presence of a ruler and urban plan, as well as by the surrounding urban environment. Simul- taneously spontaneous and mechanized, playful and unsettling, their forms increasingly abstract, Bauhaus dolls of this period 9 Steel R.U.R. Automaton (from Varites 1, no. 9 [1928]: following 480, courtesy of the Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles) likewise pass for posthumanist. "The sign of our times is abstrac- tion," Schlemmer himself declared in 1925, "which, on the one hand, functions to disconnect components from an existing whole, leading them individually ad absurdum or elevating them to their greatest potential, and, on the other, results in gener- alization and summation to create a new whole in bold out- line."41 Abstraction, in other words, helped dismantle a given object-such as the human body-into its constituent elements, rendering each one essentially useless or making it more purely and forcefully itself. At the same time, it provided a new stan- dard in keeping with the new age. Schlemmer's Highly Simplified Head (Profile) from the late 1920s indicates the extent of his fervor for pictorial abstrac- tion (Fig. 11). Reducing the head to two abstract compo- nents-a flat circle and a rectangle expanded to three dimen- sions-the drawing would seem to calculate their structural relation. It also posits a "new whole in bold outline," a radi- cally new model of human subjectivity: devoid of psychology and emotion, absent of all signs of individual identity, it can be measured with the instruments of geometry and, in the- ory, infinitely reproduced by machine. For Schlemmer, this achievement was only to be admired.

VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2003) he maintained in 1930, "it does not create a natural human being, but an artificial one; it creates a metaphor, a symbol of hu- man form ...."42 In the history of the transfiguration of the human form, this symbolic figure surpassed the limits of naturalism, providing an abstract, artificial model prepared for the challenges and delights of the posthumanist era. A drawing from about 1932 byJoost Schmidt, who was attached to the Bauhaus throughout its years in Weimar and Dessau (initially as Schlemmer's student and subsequently as a mas- ter), shows the active potential of this new artificial human (Fig. 12). Its head is a blank oval, its body a set of abstract forms joined by means of circular pivots. Unlike the more traditional body that tumbles uncontrollably in a circle at the left in the drawing, this figure is shown by means of a bold arrow to proceed directly forward into the future. One sus- pects that some human dolls designed at the Bauhaus were inspired by the wooden figures that were used in drawing classes in place of traditional nude models, as seen in a contemporaneous photograph taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt of a Bauhaus drawing class (Fig. 13).

Cause and effect are inex- tricable; given this image, it is little wonder the human doll would set the standard for human subjectivity.

Berlin, Bauhaus-Archiv and the pared-down fashions of the Weimar New Woman all suggest androgyny, reproducing the effect of Schlemmer's padded dolls from the other side of the gender divide. She is in fact anonymous, currently documented only as either Beyer herself or Ise Gropius, who was known to possess the dress.43 That the figure cannot be identified, rather than detracting from the documentary value of the photograph, certifies a central feature of Bauhaus life: the defining pres- ence of the doll, seemingly female and certainly anonymous. Three photographs taken in the late 1920s illustrate the pronounced interest in androgyny at the Bauhaus. In one, two students-one male, one female-sport similar haircuts and spectacles; photographed from above, they are shown lying down with their heads angled toward each other, the tips of their cigarettes meeting in an ashy kiss (Fig. 15). Boy and girl are almost identical; the modern habit of smoking 12 Joost Schmidt, Der Laufer, ca. 1932. Los Angeles, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, acc. no. 800972 links them physically and symbolically, marking the sexual spark between them like the "equal" sign in a mathematical equation. Another photograph, taken by Umbo (Otto Um- behr), shows a row of four seated women, equally stylish from their haircuts to their shoes, posed almost identically (Fig. 16). Their heads slightly tilted and their hands almost on their hearts, they parody a cliche of maidenly sentimentality. Three of them cross their legs, but one does not-and the disparity, intentional or not, threatens to break down the machine of modern femininity. The third photograph is a self-conscious self-portrait of pensive solitude (Fig. 17). Her hair also in a fashionable, mannish bob, Ise Gropius has used the reflections of a mirror to repeat her own image infinitely, as if internalizing the seriality of the posing women. At the Bauhaus as elsewhere in the Weimar Republic, the New Woman embraced neue Sachlichkeit.44 Drained of psychologi- cal autonomy and individualism, she allowed the trappings of androgyny to transfer her from the realm of sexual reproduc- tion to that of serial production. The advent of neue Sachlichkeit and the birth of the posthu- manist subject intensified the attention to doll figures while shifting the focus from individual replicas to figural groups. With the rise of the mass audience, and in conjunction with the emerging machine aesthetic, the individual body lost its value as the privileged site of human identity. It was replaced in the Weimar cultural imagination by the corporate body, a group entity comprising a set of identical forms operating mechanistically, in unison. The mechanical woman of the late nineteenth century had transmogrified into a larger performing machine, an elaborate configuration composed of mechanized female bodies. The urge to abstraction thus inspired the mass ornamental designs-chorus lines of iden- tical creatures, almost always female-that Kracauer de- scribed as "indissoluble girl clusters whose movements are</page><page sequence="10">BAUHAUS THEATER OF HUMAN DOLLS 733 14 Consemuiller, photograph of a woman wearing a Schlemmer mask at the Dessau Bauhaus, 1925-26.

Fourteen male figures-all slender and boyish, all wearing bathing costumes, some with hats, the first (Xanti Schawinsky) holding aloft a woman's sun parasol- kick back their heels in an impressive, messy row. "One need only glance" at a chorus line, Kracauer believed, "to learn that the ornaments are composed of thousands of bodies, sexless bodies in bathing suits. The regularity of their pat- terns is cheered by the masses, themselves arranged by the stands in tier upon ordered tier."47 Here, the spirited confla- tion of participation and performance faces the camera lens, 16 Umbo (Otto Umbehr), Posierende Midchen (Girls posing), 1927.

If the camera's presence could gather a group of people into a chorus line, photography as a medium likewise struc- tured Bauhaus activities, inspiring a wide variety of experi- mental activity. Dolls cavorted on the exterior architecture of the Dessau Bauhaus as often as they appeared in its indoor theater. They perched on several levels of the building in The Building as Stage, for example, a photograph taken by Lux Feininger in 1927 (Fig. 19). Generally reproduced (as here) with the lowermost figure cropped from the image, the orig- inal photograph contains five human dolls, each one stand- ing on its own architectural platform, while a sculpted head gazes blindly from the building's penultimate story.48 Each figure, enclosed in its costume and holding aloft at least one large and unwieldy prop, seems simultaneously expressive and speechless, communicative and dumb.

Berlin, Bauhaus-Archiv the stage, Bauhaus dolls proved remarkably photogenic, as seen in an image commemorating a performance of Schlem- mer's Triadic Ballet at the Metropol Theater in Berlin in 1926 (Fig. 20). A visual cacophony of bulbous forms and geometric shapes encases the bodies of eight performers, suppressing their individual identities and personalities. Their limbs and torsos are held at awkward angles; their gestures seem to have been inspired by the movements of modern machinery. But the sense of functionalism is undermined both by their whim- sical costumes and their careful arrangement before the cam- era, rather than in relation to one another. Compositionally attractive as a group, they are unconvincing as robots or as a potential machine. Overall, the effect is one of uncontrolla- ble exuberance, not rationalized efficiency. The existential groundwork for these new figures had al- ready been laid a decade earlier, in 1914, when Rainer Maria Rilke articulated the viewer's ambivalent relation to the fig- ure of the doll. "At a time when everyone still tried hard to answer us quickly and soothingly," Rilke wrote, it, the doll, was the first to inflict on us that larger-than-life silence that later wafted over us again and again from 19 The Building as Stage (Der Bau als Bihne), 1927, photograph by Lux Feininger.

Across from it, while it stared at us, we first experienced (or am I mistaken?) that hollowness of feel- ing, that heart pause, in which one would perish if the whole of gently persistent nature did not lift one, like a lifeless thing, over abysses.49 Owing to its extraordinary capacity to absorb empathy, Rilke writes, the doll is the first figure to impose on a child the experience of estrangement. Staring blankly, it offers a com- forting presence while cruelly inflicting a silence both un- comprehending and incomprehensible. A pivotal figure in human development, the doll prefigures relationships with others and, subsequently and figuratively, with the spaces of architecture and the world.

Rather than describing opposing models of subjectivity among spectators and the objects of their attention, empathy and estrangement exist on a theoretical continuum, each one implying the other's presence. Afforded their historical spec- ificity, they connote more than generic attraction and repul- sion; rather, they are embedded within several decades of discussion concerning the nature and function of the work of art and the aesthetic response it elicited. In 1873, the young German philosopher Robert Vischer explained that the view- er's body "unconsciously projects its own bodily form-and with this also the soul-into the form of the object," a process from which, he wrote, "I derived the notion that I call 'em- pathy,"' or Einfihlung (literally, the viewer's "feeling into" an object).50 Over the following decades, empathy theory ap- peared within a range of disciplines, including aesthetic phi- losophy, perceptual psychology, and visual and architectural theory. Variously describing the perception of space and form, it presented aesthetic experience as an embodied vi- sion that helped create the work of art. In 1961, Gropius evoked the concept, claiming that Schlemmer "experienced space not only through mere vision but with the whole body, with the sense of touch, of the dancer and the actor," before making the reference explicit: "With empathy, he would sense the directions and dynamics of a given space and make them integral parts of his mural compositions-as, for in- stance, in the Bauhaus buildings in Weimar."51 However, the process of aesthetic empathy experienced by Weimar audiences differed from that of the nineteenth-cen- tury spectator, whom theorists had treated as a solitary male viewer, his cultivated soul transported by a unique work of art within a tranquil environment. With the emergence of the modern mass audience and the newly developed media it attended-in particular, the cinema, which absorbed the attention of women as well as men-ideas about spectator- ship and the construction of modern subjectivity underwent continual reconfiguration. By the early twentieth century, empathy had fallen from favor among psychologists and aes- thetic theorists alike, owing partly to experimental research that found perceptual differences among its subjects. The concept was soon recoded as passive, describing an uncre- ative process of identification to which weak-willed audiences easily and happily succumbed. If the fully empathetic indi- vidual spectator of the nineteenth century had proven his profundity by "losing himself," as it were, in the privacy of his own home, the mass audience was now sometimes accused of empathizing too much. Benjamin would claim in 1936, "He who concentrates before the work of art becomes absorbed within it; he enters into this work. By contrast, the distracted mass absorbs the work of art into itself."52 The absorption of the isolated individual, requiring time and erudition, was thought to lift the viewer to the nobler plane of art appreci- ation, while the masses-an undifferentiated group whose proletarian tastes inspired an aesthetic of reproducible ob- jects-lowered the work of art to their own cultural level. Concurrent with the advent of neue Sachlichkeit in the 1920s, the aesthetic experience of the mass audience came to be described more positively-to be valued, that is, as much for 20 The Triadic Ballet as part of the revue Metropolis Again (Das Triadische Ballett als Teil der Revue "Wieder Metropol"), Metropol Theater, Berlin, 1926. Buhnen Archiv Oskar Schlemmer (photo: ? 2003, Buhnen Archiv Oskar Schlemmer / The Oskar Schlemmer Theatre Estate, IT-28824 Oggebbio [VB], Italy, Photo Archive C. Raman Schlemmer, 28824 Oggebbio [VB], Italy) its capacity to induce critical thinking as for its radical polit- ical potential. Brecht's concept of Verfremdung (alienation or estrangement), for example, developed both theoretically and theatrically, interrupted sustained absorption to render the familiar strange and, in the process, to construct a spec- tator who was actively engaged intellectually.53 Directly op- posing the concept of estrangement in Brecht's schema, empathy represented a traditional, passive model of bour- geois spectatorship.54 Where empathy encouraged emotional transport, estrangement prevented such passive spectator- ship, maintaining the audience's critical awareness of its dis- tance from the work of art. The intermittent use of estrange- ment, Brecht argued, was "necessary to avoid the intoxicating effects of illusion," to prevent the audience from becoming too absorbed by the aesthetic experience.55 However, as he acknowledged in his journals, both techniques were neces- sary to achieve theatrical success.56 Estrangement was impos- sible without the intermittent presence of empathy-as the dolls at the Bauhaus, of course, were well aware. Moholy-Nagy's discussion of the mechanical stage figures of Futurism, Expressionism, and Dada reveals the extent to which the intertwined models of empathy and estrange- ment-identification and shock-were expressed and en- couraged by the performing bodies of the 1920s: "The effect of this bodily mechanics," he wrote, "essentially lies in the spectator being astonished or startled by the possibilities of his own organism as demonstrated to him by others."57 Re- producing the machine in human form, such robots replaced the bourgeois characters of the naturalist stage with mechan- ical creatures. Yet as literal representations of modern mech- anization, he believed, they still relied on the traditional technique of empathy. Spectators would identify their own bodies with those onstage, recognizing their differences with a pleasant frisson of shock. By contrast, the figures he de- manded (and that Schlemmer and others would design)</page><page sequence="13">736 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOLUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 represented posthumanism at a symbolic level. Rather than simply reflecting modern machines literally, through their forms, Bauhaus dolls absorbed them into their structures. They did so both individually, through gesture, and-more crucially-at the level of the group. Individual dolls could be invested with personality by empathetic viewers; gathered together in photographs or on the stage, they formed the quintessential objects of estrangement. Trained by dolls to understand their own posthuman potential, spectators learned to discard their individuality and join the mass audi- ence. Surrogates of human Sachlichkeit onstage faced the sachlich humans in the audience: mirror images so interchangeable as to render the orchestra pit almost obsolete. Benjamin, expert equally in allegorical drama and children's toys, went so far as to claim that, in the auditoriums of the Weimar Republic, "the abyss that separates the players from the audience like the dead from the living... has become functionless."58 Kra- cauer, too, noted the trend, writing in 1926 that "the surface glamour of the stars, films, revues, and spectacular shows" in Berlin mirrored its viewers' shallow collective consciousness. "Here, in pure externality," he explained, "the audience encounters itself; its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions."59 Like Benjamin- but with an ambivalence that stemmed from his own appre- ciation of the movies-Kracauer opposed such effortless view- ing habits to the intense absorption of the traditional spectator. He ascribed the change in spectatorship to a change in spectators themselves, citing especially the in- creased number of salaried workers, the growing presence of women in the workforce, and the exacerbation of capitalism's rationalizing impulses.60 In Kracauer's view, women visiting the cinema on their evenings off work were particularly prone to the shallow pleasures and perils of distraction. "Furtively," he wrote, with a combination of sympathy, snob- bery, and sexism, "the little shopgirls wipe their eyes and quickly powder their noses before the lights go up" at the end of each film.61 His opinions were prompted not only by actual changes in the composition of audiences but also by the widespread tendency, in the Weimar Republic as elsewhere, to treat mass culture as female-in its models of spectatorship no less than the objects of its attention.62 Bauhaus performances occurred in a remarkable variety of venues, from the experimental stage of the Dessau building to its balconies and roofs, where students and masters ca- vorted before the camera both in and out of costume-or from the German National Theater in Weimar, where the Triadic Ballet appeared as the culminating event of the cele- brations of Bauhaus week in August 1923, to the unbuilt designs for theaters for mass audiences. The Triadic Ballet nevertheless remains the production most often associated with the school; begun by Schlemmer in 1912 and first pre- sented in full at the Landestheater in Stuttgart ten years later, the project was reincarnated several times over the course of the following decade to critical and popular acclaim. In addition to the Stuttgart and Weimar productions, others took place in Dresden, Donauschingen, Berlin, Frankfurt, and Paris, some as full-length performances and others within larger revues.63 Delighted by the favorable response, Schlemmer transcribed some reviews into his diary for fur- ther analysis.64 "The Triadic Ballet," he explained in an essay of 1926, "which avoids being actually mechanical or actually grotesque and which avoids actual pathos and heroism by keeping to a certain harmonious mean, is part of a larger entity-a 'metaphysical revue'-to which the theoretical in- vestigations and the actual work of the Bauhaus stage at Dessau are also related."65 The absence at the Bauhaus of any strict demarcation between traditional theater performances and more general theatrical experimentation helps to ex- plain the presence of the work's costumes in a range of photographs unconnected to particular productions, with The Building as Stage offering only one of many examples. Schlemmer laid out one version of the play's structure in a drawing of 1926, arranging the acts into columns, each di- vided horizontally into numbered scenes (Fig. 21).-The tripartite structure of the Triadic Ballet -performed by three dancers, two men and a woman-contained three acts with five, three, and four scenes, respectively. (This structure was variable; the three acts of the Weimar production in 1923, for example, contained six, three, and three scenes, respec- tively.) The three features of the ballet, according to Schlem- mer, were "the costumes which are of a colored, three-dimen- sional design, the human figure which is an environment of basic mathematical shapes, and the corresponding move- ments of that figure in space."66 He also considered the "fusion of the dance, the costumes, and the music" to operate triadically, an association perhaps more wisely ascribed to his own tendency to think in threes. In his plan, the characters appear either frontally or in profile, equal in height to the rectangles that contain them, which are painted yellow, white, and black, according to the dominant color of each act. The fanciful, brightly colored costumes are composed of circles, spheres, triangles, and spirals; the padded forms with masks and hats appear inflatable. The symmetrical bodies seem no less abstract; stilted postures render limbs unlimber. Whimsical and awkward, the figures evoke marionettes, cir- cus clowns, and the ultimate machine creatures of the 1920s. Overall, the performance described the trajectory of dance history, leading from a relatively traditional dance in the first scene of act 1 to a dance of pure movement in the last scene of the third act. It traveled, in other words, from naturalism to abstraction, its sequence of costumes proceeding from almost human to thoroughly artificial. The first scene was performed by a female dancer wearing a modified ballerina's tutu; the third-act finale by a solitary creature with a spiral for a chest, a face composed of three nonrepresentational forms (all sharing one eye), and outstretched arms that brandished the tip of a spear and a rounded stick. This latter figure- whom Schlemmer labeled "the abstract"- exceeds the boundaries of its rectangle, as if breaking through the realm of representation at the end of the performance, into the world beyond.67 An entire production of the Triadic Ballet thus appears within a grid; each row depicts, at a glance, the characters, costumes, and background color of each scene, with intermissions occurring, as it were, between the col- umns. Beyond its utilitarian function, the design of the drawing is doubly significant at the level of its structure.

Using traditional artistic media (ink and watercolor on paper), in other words, the depiction operates like three reels of film, evoking what was at the time the most technically advanced form of visual representation. The affinity of Bauhaus dolls for photogra- phy is here set in motion; if these abstracted figures were to feel at home in any context, it might well be that of the cinema, the exalted medium of the age of mechanical repro- ducibility. Shadow puppets of the machine age, they embody the existential shallowness of celluloid modernity. At the same time, they appear fundamentally incapable of feeling "at home" anywhere, exuding instead a sense of the uncanny as it was articulated by Freud in 1919. "The uncanny [ Unheim- lich] is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar," Freud argued, describing the double sensation of familiarity and strangeness.68 Ador- ably animistic and uncomfortably inhuman, eerily charming, the dancing Weimar bodies of Schlemmer's drawing offer, simultaneously, the familiar playfulness of dolls and the sin- ister hollowness of mechanical creatures. The logic of the film strip operates in tandem with a second structural feature of Schlemmer's drawing, which not only re-creates human bodies as dolls in the individual depic- tions but also reproduces this new creature at another scale. The first and third acts each form larger figures, their bodies outlined by the colored backgrounds of the individual scenes. A yellow figure at the left, the height of the page itself, stands to attention with its arms at its sides: its head consists of the dancer in the first scene, its torso a perfect rectangle of four figures, and its legs the two soloists of the act's final scenes. The black figure at the right, meanwhile, four rectangles high, possesses a head and feet of equal size and a triangular body in between, with two identical dancers surmounting three more standing symmetrically below. Read in this way, the ballet's first and third acts form the bodies of, respec- tively, a man and a woman. He stands like a rectangular robot. She has breasts formed by the halos behind the upper bodies of the two dancers in scene 2; the metal winding in spirals around the female dancer at the center of scene 3-the "wire figure"-suggests pubic hair above the dotted lines that delineate, simultaneously, her legs and the crotch of the larger figure. Viewed in this context, the little dolls in each scene may be considered ideal participants in the mass ornamental forms that, as Kracauer wrote, "are never per- formed by the fully preserved bodies, whose contortions are ; a :"</page><page sequence="15">738 ART BULL.ETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOIUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 22 The Triadic Ballet, two figures from the yellow row, act 1, scene 3 duet (Das Triadische Ballett, zwei Figurinen aus der Gelben Reihe, 3.

Below this platonic shape are glued two paragraphs of typed text: notes on the ballet's formal components and performance history.70 In Stuttgart in 1922, Schlemmer played one of the parts of the Triadic Ballet; Albert Burger and Elsa Hotzel, partners in dance as in marriage who had appeared together in the ballet before, filled the two main roles. A photograph shows the two performing the third dance in the first act, a duet accompa- nied by the music of Marco Enrico Bossi (Fig. 22). Their feet turned out in classic ballet position, their expressions stark like those of pantomime figures, and their arms gesticulating woodenly, Burger and Hotzel are formally linked but do not seem to interact. In their polka-dotted, bulbous, or cylindri- cal costumes, they are uncanny but appealing, human yet mechanical; they are simultaneously dolls reconceived in human size and humans re-created as dolls. A confusion over gender parallels that of scale: if it is initially unclear in Schlemmer's diagram that the cylindrical figure is male and the spherical one female (their genders are reversed from the previous scene), the photograph is easily legible, yet the male dancer wears something akin to a tutu both around his waist and around his neck. The gender ambiguity is signifi- cant; in his diary that year Schlemmer registered his approval of the use of masks and his nostalgia for the use of men to represent women onstage: "Dates that historians consider high points," he wrote, "should rather be called declines: 1681, the first appearance of female dancers-until then female roles had been performed by men. 1772, the abolition of face masks."71 "Today the arts exist in isolation," Gropius proclaimed in 1919 in the initial Bauhaus program; he found this a regret- table condition, "from which they can be rescued only through the conscious, cooperative effort of all craftsmen."72 To idealize the unification of all the arts in early-twentieth- century Germany was almost a cultural cliche, heavily in- debted to Richard Wagner's formulation of the Gesamtkunst- werk, the exalted total work of art. "The highest shared artwork is the Drama...." the composer had declared seven decades earlier; "true Drama is only conceivable as emerging from the shared urge on the part of all the arts toward the most direct communication to a shared public."73 One might draw a parallel between this unification of the arts and the way in which the umbrella structure of the general introductory course at the Bauhaus sheltered the specialized training of students within particular workshops.74 "Together, let us de- sire, conceive, and create the new structure of the future," Gropius entreated, echoing the composer's formulation of "the artwork of the future" from his essay of that title.75 Wagnerian echoes overlapped with those of the compos- er's erstwhile disciple, Friedrich Nietzsche, whose impor- tance for artistic thinking in Germany in the early twentieth century (and particularly in Weimar, where his archives were located) was unrivaled. As Count Harry Kessler, one of the city's leading cultural figures, stated. categorically, "The way in which Nietzsche influenced, or more precisely possessed, us cannot be compared with the effect of any other contem- porary figure or poet."76 By 1919, the creative, international- ist idol of prewar Germany had become a cult figure of right-wing nationalism, but pan-Nietzschean sentiments con- tinued to captivate Germans across the political spectrum. A romantic Nietzscheanism lurked at the Weimar Bauhaus, inhabiting the souls of its artistically inclined idealists. Gropius, no exception to this tendency, advocated the "mu- tual planning of extensive, Utopian structural designs-pub- lic buildings and buildings for worship-aimed at the future," but he posited churches, not theaters, as the communally constructed buildings that would incorporate all forms of art. Omitting both theater architecture and such subsidiary arts as costume and set design, stage decor painting, and the making of props, the program mentioned performance only in the context of extracurricular entertainment: "Encourage- ment of friendly relations between masters and students out- side of work; therefore plays, lectures, poetry, music, costume parties."77 Exactly as Gropius decreed, theatrical events ranging from</page><page sequence="16">BAUHAUS THEATER OF HUMAN DOI.I.S 739 plays to costume parties, from organized fetes to spontaneous festivities, operated as essential binding agents for social life at the Bauhaus. "We worked on them as if obsessed," Felix Klee later recalled; "Oskar Schlemmer presented his stage plays especially for them. On May 18 we celebrated Walter Gropius's birthday. Every year was the traditional lantern party."78 Wassily Kandinsky's acquisition of German citizen- ship in early 1928 provided another occasion for a celebra- tion, which he attended wearing traditional German Lederho- sen. Parties dissolved the boundaries between spectators and performers, with all in attendance taking part in the larger spectacle. At a professional level, they provided innumerable opportunities for the design of invitations, posters, costumes, and room interiors, as well as for performances by various Bauhaus groups.79 One of the most famous of these was the "Beard, Nose, and Heart Party," organized by the Bauhaus band and held in Berlin on March 31, 1928-coincidentally, Gropius's last day as director-with invitations designed by Herbert Bayer. As a fund-raiser for the Bauhaus with an entrance fee of 10 marks (half price for art students), the event featured performances by the Bauhaus theater group. A photograph by Umbo is thought to depict two revelers at this Bauhaus party: two identical clowns wearing jackets and ties and sporting dark painted mustaches and metallic beards, eyebrows, noses, and thick, curly hair (Fig. 23). While one stares intently at the viewer, the other, identical save for the addition of a pair of spectacles, appears in profile, gazing with equal seriousness to the left; together they present the front and side views of the same party specimen. The funnels perched upside down on their heads seem to bear a func- tional relation to the long tubes, held in their mouths like straws, that cross each other before disappearing over what appears to be the figures' shared shoulder-possibly to reap- pear at the tops of their funnels. Their heads held close, their bodies appear to merge, while the tubes and funnels share a delightful mechanical uselessness. Despite an absence of background detail, one senses the event's overlapping sounds, swirling movements, and multitude of other guests; emerging from the darkness with the blurred clarity of an alcoholic gaze, the two revelers embody a deadpan glee. Bodily interference-the clown tripping over his feet, the prankster falling from his chair-infused Bauhaus parties, accompanied by musical bands, dancing, recitations, and general merriment.80 Under their funnels, the two revelers seem prime candidates for the happy irritation produced by their own bodies; nothing would appear to please them more than the prospect of tripping over their own feet. Except, perhaps, for the possibility of tripping over each other's feet-and, the photograph suggests, these two revel- ers might not even register the difference. Identically dressed and decorated, they are mimetically twinned like mirror im- ages in a carnival funhouse, their doubled presence destroy- ing any sense of individuality. Encrustations of face paint render their faces as masks, devoid of the outward manifes- tations of human personality. With identical poise, they mir- ror each other on either side of the photograph; the crossed tubes emanating from their mouths mark a hinge between them. While the figure on the left stares directly at the camera, and at the viewer, his twin presents a more ambigu- ous gaze. If he is staring into the distance, then the two look 23 Umbo, Two revelers at the Beard, Nose, and Heart Party, Berlin, 1928. Los Angeles, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, acc. no. 850514 past each other, peering at cross-purposes: a face and profile exemplifying serious silliness. If, however, he stares at his partner, then the viewer is incorporated into a triangular mise en abime of clown vision, a construction of gazes interrupted only by the viewer's doubling back to return the gaze of the figure on the left. The viewer-perhaps on the verge of sensing an inverted funnel atop his or her own head-might well suppose that the crowd of party goers outside the frame contains more copies from the same mold: an assembly line of identical clowns in formal attire, purposefully sipping from useless straws. Here as elsewhere, theatrical exuberance at the Bauhaus is undermined by uncanny repetition. Although probably taken in 1928, the photograph might instead depict the notorious "Metallic Party" held in Dessau early the following year. Originally entitled the "Church Bells, Doorbells, and Other Bells Party," this event was re- named, it is said, in an effort to keep the noise level down. Guests came attired in metallic objects of all kinds, from tinfoil to frying pans. They entered the party by sliding down a large chute that deposited them in the first of several rooms decorated for the occasion. An anonymous report printed in a local newspaper several days later described the event's delightful confusion. "And then there was music in the air everywhere," it read, and everything was glitter wherever one turned.

In addition music, bells, tinkling cymbals everywhere, in every room, in the stairways, wher- 8B ever one went....8 With breathless syntax, the text reproduces the sense of exhilaration fostered by the party's carnival atmosphere, as musical bands played in competition with one another while other musical sounds, less easily categorized, wafted through the Bauhaus air. The Metallic Party also featured more tra- ditional performances in the building's auditorium, where, the newspaper reported, "a gay farrago of film pictures alter- nated with various stage presentations."82 Such theatricality manifested itself both in formal perfor- mances and in the guise of general exuberance. "One does not want simply to see the play on the stage, but to perform the play oneself," Karl Friedrich Schinkel-perhaps Germa- ny's most famous theater architect-had declared in 1810.83 Reciprocity between spectator and performance, a trope of theater discourse increasingly prevalent after 1900, was ex- plored explicitly at the Bauhaus. Bemoaning the structural and symbolic "isolation of the stage," for example, Moholy- Nagy stated that in today's theater, STAGE AND SPECTATOR are separated too much from each other, divided too much into active and passive, for creative relationships and tensions to be pro- duced between them. An activity must be developed that does not let the masses watch silently, that does not simply excite them inwardly, but that instead lets them take hold of, participate in, and-at the highest level of a redemp- tive ecstasy-merge with the action on stage.84 The aesthetic response was not meant to occur too far be- yond the limits of spectators' bodies; rather, performances would inspire a seated audience to a cathartic communal surge of emotion, an active but relatively contained experi- ence. These efforts would be especially encouraged by the designs for three Bauhaus theaters: Farkas Molnar's U-The- ater, seating 1,590; the Spherical Theater of Andreas Wei- ninger; and Gropius's Total Theater of 1926, a 2,000-seat amphitheater intended for the productions of Erwin Pisca- tor.85 This last structure was to contain neither private boxes nor other architectural subdivisions, such as aisles, to divide the audience hierarchically. Within the Dessau auditorium, 164 steel-frame tubular chairs designed by Breuer, with folding canvas seats, formed a unified block of spectators: eight identical rows of 19 chairs preceded a back row comprising 12 chairs that flanked the room's wide entryway. Designed to present both lectures and more elaborate stage performances and raked very gently to improve sight lines, the room expressed the sachlich ideals of practicality and functionalism.86 A photograph taken by Con- semuller in 1928 of the block of seats prompts an image of a block of identical spectators (Fig. 24). As in Gropius's Total Theater, designed the same year, the unity of the audience is emphasized. No spatial or architectural elements subdivide the spectators, whose unity as a group-and reciprocal rela- tionship with the posthumanist performers-is thereby en- couraged.8 Another photograph by Consemuller, taken one year earlier from the back of this auditoriumi, shows a re- hearsal in progress onstage (Fig. 25). At the center, Schlem- mer perches in profile on a set of three steps. With his right hand, he gestures at the dancer Siedhoff, who stands on a wooden platform at left in a Schlemmer doll outfit, mask in hand, and leans against another structure.

Nachlass Erich Consemiiller, Cologne, private collection (from Herzogenrath and Kraus, Erich Consemiller, pl. 118) photograph, as Schlemmer observes Siedhoffs performance and the two Breuer stools between them evoke the more comfortable seats in the auditorium. Revealed in the wings on the right, Andreas Weininger, clothed in worker's cover- alls, directs a movie camera out the window, toward the building's terrace. An unidentified man plays the grand piano in the auditorium at right, while another stands at the cen- ter, watching the scene from the canteen behind the stage, its floor level with the stage. Another figure lurks at the left, its body a padded Schlemmer costume hung from a giant lad- der, its head resting on the steps below. Hardly a spontaneous rehearsal image, the photograph presents the Bauhaus the- ater as Gesamtkunstwerk: music, dance, film, stage direction, spectatorship, and a decapitated Bauhaus doll gather to- gether onstage, poised equally for the camera. Creatures simultaneously without affect and fully invested with personality performed on a range of Bauhaus stages, occupied its auditoriums, celebrated at its costume parties, and clambered over its architecture to be captured by its cameras. Seven decades earlier, Wagner had imagined the following ideal scene at the theater: The spectator completely transports himself on to the stage by looking and hearing; the performer becomes an artist only by complete absorption into the audience; the audience, that representative of public life, disappears from the auditorium.... It lives and breathes now only in the work of art, which seems to it life itself, and on the stage, which seems to be the whole world.88 In the 1920s, the Bauhaus theater aimed at something simi- lar. Complete identification would transpire between per- formers and spectators; the auditorium walls would fall away to reveal the entire world as the ultimate Bauhaus stage. But such developments ultimately depended on the receptivity of its audience, in Schlemmer's eyes: "It begins with building the new house of the stage out of glass, metal and tomorrow's inventions," he maintained in 1925. "But it also begins with the spectator's inner transformation."89 Recognizing them- selves in the Bauhaus dolls, Weimar spectators experienced a communal heart pause worthy of Rilke as all of nature lifted them, like lifeless things, across the abyss of modernity itself.

Walter Gropius, "Program for the Staatiche Bauhaus in Weimar" (April 1919), in Wingler, 31. By contrast, Gropius called for instruction in a range of other subjects that he considered necessary for a complete education in the arts. These included anatomy, garden design, contract negotiation, book- keeping, and art history-this last, he enjoined, "not presented in the sense of a history of styles, but rather to further active understanding of historical working methods and techniques" (32). The "Statutes of the Staatliche Bau- haus in Weimar" published in January 1921, which includes a section on the curriculum, likewise makes no mention of theater. See Wingler, 44-48. 4. Schlemmer had been hired in 1922 as master of form in charge of woodworking and stone sculpture but was already overseeing theater work when Schreyer quit in early 1923, during rehearsals for performances that summer during Bauhaus week.

Copies of the book itself are dated 1924, when it was put together in Weimar; secondary literature on the Bauhaus generally gives a publication date of 1925, when the book was edited in Dessau. The book contains essays by Farkas Molnar, Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy, and Schlemmer himself, with additional images by Marcel Breuer, Kurt Schmidt, and Alex- ander (Xanti) Schawinsky. It gained an introduction by Gropius when it was published in 1961 in English translation as The Theater of theBauhaus (Schlem- mer et al., 1961). 6. Schlemmer, 7. 7.

Schlemmer, 18-19: "Die Kunstfigur erlaubtjegliche Bewegung, jegliche Lage in beliebiger Zeitdauer, sie erlaubt-ein bildkinstlerisches Mittel aus Zeiten bester Kunst-die verschiedenartigen Gr6ssenverhaltnisse der Figu- ren: Bedeutende gross, Unbedeutende klein." 10. Schlemmer, in Hfineke, 230-31, emphasis in the original: "Immer, wenn es sich um Gestaltung handelt, um freie Komposition, deren erstes Ziel nicht die Naturannaherung sein kann; wenn es sich kurzerhand im Stil han- delt, so tritt der Typus der Figur in den Bereich des Puppenhaften." He continued, "In all early cultures that were also high cultures-the Egyptians, the early Greeks, early Indian art-the human form is far from the naturalistic image, but thus closer to the lapidary symbolic form: the idol, the totem, the doll.... [In allen fruhen Kulturen, die zugleich hohe waren: bei den Agyptern, den frahen Griechen, der frihen indischen Kunst ist die menschliche Gestalt fern dem naturalistischen Abbild, aber um so niiher der lapidaren Symbolgestalt: dem Idol, dem Gotzen, der Puppe....]." The modernist emphasis on theatricality, Reiner Nagele has argued, "radicalizes exteriority to the point where the living actors are replaced by the puppet," a creature that "radically refuses dialogue," its silence enforced by the impossibility of discerning the creature's source of speech.

"For much of the first half of this [the twentieth] century," Christopher Phillips has written, "montage served not only as an innovative artistic tech- nique but functioned, too, as a kind of symbolic form, providing a shared visual idiom that more than any other expressed the tumultuous arrival of a fully urbanized, industrialized culture." Phillips, introduction to Teitelbaum (as in n. 11), 22. An anonymous text in the Soviet journal Lef, probably by Gustav Klutsis, advocates the technique for its effectiveness: "A combi- nation of snapshots takes the place of the composition in a graphic depic- tion....

Under the directorship of Hannes Meyer (1928-30), the Bauhaus in fact encouraged leftist politics, inspiring an engagement with collective pro- duction as much as with communism. 17. See, for example, Winfried Nerdinger, ed., Bauhaus-Moderne im National- sozialismus: Zwischen Anbiederung und Verfolgung (Munich: Prestel, 1993), esp.

Schlemmer to Gunta St6tzl, June 16, 1933, quoted in Nerdinger, "Mo- dernisierung, Bauhaus, Nationalsozialismus," in Nerdinger (as in n. 17), 19: "Ich ffihle mich rein und meine Kunst streng den nat. soz. Grundsatzen entsprechend, namlich 'heroisch, stahlern-romantisch, unsentimental, hart, scharf, klar, typenschaffend' usw." "Schlemmer, who in 1934 submitted to a competition for a mosaic in the Deutsches Museum a design depicting a group marching and giving the Hitler salute to a luminous image of the Fuihrer, wrestled for years with his position toward and within National Socialism, as his diaries (in the Bauhaus Archiv) attest." Ibid., 23 n. 52. Wingler, 257, told a different story in 1969: "Following his dismissal from the teaching profession, which had been decreed by the National Socialists [in 1933], he was forced to take odd jobs in order to manage." 19. Following World War II, such diametrically opposed arguments were indeed made in East and West Germany about the Bauhaus. See Nerdinger (as in n. 18), 17-18.

Moholy-Nagy-whose photograph Puppen was made in 1925-also worked with dolls; "out of his theoretical laboratory experiments at the Bauhaus," Gropius (as in n. 2), 10, recalled in 1961, "Moholy later developed original stage settings for the Kroll Opera House in Berlin for the Tales of Hoffmann and for other operatic and theatrical performances...." 25.

So, too, did cinema: Ernst Lubitsch based Die Puppe (1919) on Hoff- mann's tales, for example; Walther Ruttmann's Berlin, Symphonie der Grossstadt (1927) is permeated by mannequins. James Whale's 1931 film Frankenstein, based on Mary Shelley's book of 1817, assigned the inventor's name to his creation, conflating creator and creation precisely as had the ballet Coppelia, which reassigned to the doll the name of its inventor, Coppelius, in Hoff- mann's tale "The Sandman" of 1815. 28.

The most famous automata, however, often proved to be elaborate hoaxes.

Beaune (as in n. 32), 436. According to Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues, "The word automaton contains a contradiction, because it applies both to spontaneity of movement and to the mechanization of it. Thus we come back to the idea of ambiguity and the light it casts on the strange spell automata exercise over us." Pieyre de Mandiargues, "Les rouages de l'automate," pref- ace to Jean Prasteau, Les automates (Paris: Griind, 1968), quoted in Beaune, 475. 34. On the "disenchantment with language and the growing appeal of nonverbal expression" characteristic of European theatrical modernism, see Howard B. Segal, Body Ascendant: Modernism and the Physical Imperative (Balti- more: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998), 32 and passim. For Segal, this tendency is epitomized in the work of Hugo von Hofmannsthal, whose "Letter to Lord Chandos" captured the crisis of narrative and language in 1900 and who in 1911 wrote, "Words evoke a keener sympathy, but it is at the same time figurative, intellectualized, and generalized. Music, on the other hand, evokes a fiercer sympathy, but it is vague, longingly extravagant. But the sympathy summoned by gestures is clearly all-embracing, contemporary, gratifying." Notably, the purpose of each art form here is the evocation of sympathy. Hofmannsthal, quoted in Segal, 43. 35. For an analysis of abstraction in Schlemmer's choreography, see Toepfer (as in n. 4), 138-45; on the antipsychologist impulse, see Martin Jay, "Modernism and the Specter of Psychologism," Modernism / Modernity 3, no. 2 (May 1996): 93-111. Related (but not identical) to the emphasis on physical gestures is Brecht's theory of Gestus, or gest, first articulated in print in 1930 in "The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre," reprinted in Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic, ed. and trans. John Willet (New York: Hill and Wang, 1994), 33-42. More directly linked is the development of biomechan- ics by the Soviet director Vsevolod Meyerhol'd, inspired partly by German theatrical modernist abstraction. 36.

Moholy-Nagy (as in n. 28), 49: "So kommt der Irrtum der Futuristen, Expressionisten, und Dadaisten und der Fehler aller auf dieser Basis gebauten Folgerungen (z. B. NUR mechanisch Exzentrik) zum Vorschein.... Es wurde dadurch die Vorherrschaft der nur logisch-gedanklichen Werte aufgehoben." 38.

"Posthumanism is the conscious response, whether with applause or regret, to the dissolution of psychological autonomy and individualism brought by technological modernization.

The two other signs of the age were, according to Schlemmer, mechanization and "the new possibilities given by technology and invention [die neuen Mbglichkeiten, gegeben durch Technik und Erfindung]." 42. Schlemmer, wall text written in 1930 for the Folkwang Museum, Essen, in Hiineke, 231, emphasis in the original: "Denn die Abstraktion der mensch- lichen Gestalt ... schafft das Abbild in einem hoheren Sinne, sie schafft nicht das Naturwesen Mensch, sondern ein Kunstwesen; sie schafft ein Gleichnis, ein Symbol der menschlichen Gestalt." 43.

See Brecht, "Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting," in Brecht (as in n. 35), 91-99. The background historical narrative provided here extends from 1914, when the Russian Formalist writer and critic Viktor Shklovsky proclaimed ostranenie, or estrangement, as the defining concept of art, through the Soviet theorists in the Lef group to Brecht's articulation in 1936 of the Verfremdungseffekt. See Stanley Mitchell, "From Shklovsky to Brecht: Some Preliminary Remarks towards a History of the Politicisation of Russian Formalism," and Ben Brewster, "From Shklovsky to Brecht: A Reply," both in Screen 15, no. 2 (summer 1974): 74-102; Peter Demetz, introduction to Brecht: A Collection of Critical Essays (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1962), 1-15; Koss, "Brecht and Russian Estrangement," paper presented at the International Brecht Society Annual Symposium, San Diego, May 1998; and idem, "Playing Politics with Estranged and Empathetic Audiences: Bertolt Brecht and Georg Fuchs," South Atlantic Quarterly 96, no. 4 (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1998): 809-20. 54. Worringer had used empathy as a foil for his discussion of abstraction in 1908; the concept also operated as an ambiguous foil for Zerstreuung, or distraction, in Kracauer's work.

Moholy-Nagy (as in n. 28), 47: "Die Wirkung dieser Korpermechanik- ... besteht im wesentlichen darin, dass der Zuschauer iber die ihm von andern vorgefuhrten M6glichkeiten seines eigenen Organismus erstaunt oder erschrocken ist.

"Nobody would notice the figure at all if the crowd of spectators, who have an aesthetic relation to the ornament and do not represent anyone, were not sitting in front of it." Kracauer, "The Mass Ornament," in ibid., 77. Notably, Paul de Man associated Kleist and Kracauer via the theme of distraction. "When, in the concluding lines of Kleist's text ["On the Marionette Theater"], K is said to be 'ein wenig zerstreut,' then we are to read, on the strength of all that goes before, zerstreut not only as distracted but also as dispersed, scattered, and dismembered."

"Ever since capitalism has existed, of course, within its defined bound- aries rationalization has always occurred. Yet the rationalization period from 1925 to 1928 represents a particularly important chapter, which has produced the irruption of the machine and 'assembly-line' methods into the clerical departments of big firms."

By 1926, Toepfer (as in n. 4), 140, writes, "the dance was famous enough to spawn a gallery exhibit in Central European cities. As the piece grew older, it became shorter; once an evening-long event, it wound up featured on a program of modernist works. Finally, in 1932 the piece went to Paris as part of an international dance competition promoting the restoration of elite, high cultural glory to ballet."

"The surprising success of the debut of the Bauhaus theater in Berlin," he proudly noted in May 1929, "created the pleasant circumstance that theoretical defences and speculations are justified by the facts of practice and may be detached from these [Das uberraschende Erfolg des Debits der Bauhaus- biihne in Berlin ... schuf die angenehme Lage, dass die theoretischen Verteidigungen und Spekulationen durch die Tatsache der Praxis gerechtfertigt und von diesen abgelost werden]." Schlemmer, diary entry, in Huneke, 209-10. "'Why is the public so enthusiastic? From primitivism, opposition, the emotion of contemporary culture? From a misunderstanding of the humor, from a desire for Variety shows?' So asks the well-known expert dance scholar Professor Oskar Bie.... ['Warum ist das Publikum so begeistert?

While the prevalence of isolated body parts in Weimar cultural representation is often attributed to the German experience of World War I, the presence of severed limbs across a spectrum of works both before and after the war demands a larger treatment of the relations between cultural production, industrial society, and the evolving discussion of modern subjectivity. Such a project would accommo- date Kracauer's association of the limbs of alienated labor with those per- forming cultural estrangement ("the hands in the factory correspond to the legs of the Tiller Girls"; ibid., 79); it would also engage further the thematic of gender among the androgynous Weimar dolls. 70. The two paragraphs of text read as follows: "'Triadisch,' abgeleitet von Triad = Dreizahl, Dreiklang. Es sind 3 Tanzer (eine Tanzerin und zwei Tanzer, die einzeln, zu zweien, oder zu dreien tanzen); drei Hauptfarben der Buhne: citrongelbe, weiss und schwarz; es sind zusammen 12 Tanze in zusam- men 18 Kostfimen. Das Ballett entstand z.T. schon vor 1914. Teile davon wurden 1916 aufgefuhrt. Erstauffihrung des ganzen Balletts 1922 in Lan- destheater in Stuttgart. Darauf in Weimar und Dresden. Spater (mit Musik zu einer mechanischen Orgel von Paul Hindemith) in Donauschingen und in einer Revue in Berlin" ("Triadic," derived from Triad, in the mathematical and musical senses. There are three dancers [one female and two male, who dance individually, in pairs, or all three together]; three main colors on the stage: lemon yellow, white, and black; there are 12 dances and 18 costumes altogether. The ballet had already begun prior to 1914. Parts of it were performed in 1916. Premiere of full ballet in 1922 in the Landestheater in Stuttgart. Repeated in Weimar and Dresden. Later [with music for mechan- ical organ by Paul Hindemith] in Donauschingen and in a revue in Berlin). 71. Schlemmer, diary entry of Sept. 1922, in Huneke, 96. 72. Gropius (as in n. 3), 31. 73.

That Gropius and others embraced this cultural lineage with renewed zeal in early 1919 is also unremarkable; Wagner's cultural politics, developed in the context of the 1848 revolution, would have appealed strongly to those of Nietzschean bent during the revolutionary early Weimar era, when socialist leanings were easily expressed as a demand for cultural unity achieved by means of revolutionary creativity. 75. Gropius (as in n. 3), 31. The notion of the theater of the future and that of theater as the highest cultural symbol had recently been formulated in Germany by Peter Behrens in Feste des Lebens und der Kunst: Eine Betrachtung des Theaters als Hichsten Kultursymbols (Darmstadt: C. F. Winter'shen, 1900); and by Georg Fuchs in Die Schaubithne der Zukunft (Leipzig: Georg Miiller, 1905). 76.

Schlemmer even created his own Nietzschean aphorisms. "The world belongs to the dancer, as Nietzsche would say," Schlemmer wrote in a letter to Otto Meyer-Amden, Dec. 28, 1919, in Hineke, 58.

The spontaneous festivities of the Weimar years became more orga- nized in Dessau; gaining infamy as financial burdens increased, they operated as fund-raisers in the school's final year, in Berlin.

Nagele (as in n. 10), 3, has described the foregrounding of the body in the performances of the 1920s; citing "Brecht's gestural and epic theater, the theater of cruelty and the absurd, a theater where a clown appears and stumbles ostentatiously," he states that after the "increasing interiorization" that characterized bourgeois drama, "the body becomes visible as an obstacle; it speaks through irritation." Likewise relevant is the growing popularity of cabaret performance and theatrical revues in the 1920s; see Peter Jelavich, Munich and Theatrical Modernism: Politics, Playwriting, and Performance, 1890- 1914 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), 139-84. 81.

A related discussion of the contemporaneous productions of Erwin Piscator, beyond the scope of the present essay, might explore the shared effort to render the spectator a participant by combining such ele- ments as film and slide projections into a larger theatrical event. Bauhaus performances avoided Piscator's political orientation (and Brecht's attempt to "refunction" spectators politically). Schlemmer called Piscator "very polit- ically tendentious, but strong in this approach. Doesn't understand our thing-for him it's just play. Nevertheless he intends-said this in passing- eventually to collaborate on creating a theater school in Berlin, but very politically leftist." Schlemmer to Tut Schlemmer, Apr. 11, 1927, in Huneke, 170. John Willett has described Piscator, whose Berlin home was outfitted by the Bauhaus furniture workshop, as "providing the Bauhaus with its main link to the Berlin stage"; in addition to the Total Theater, he also commissioned theater settings from Moholy-Nagy in 1928.
