For the past 100 or so years biogeographers have been predisposed to believe that the geog- raphy of the earth has been relatively stable, and that the distribution of life has been relatively labile. The belief, stemming from Darwin and Wallace, was that species dispersed, or migrated, from one area to another, over, around or through barriers, to arrive in some new area where they subsequently evolved into new species and groups. Biogeographers consequently studied means of dispersal in the belief that dispersal is the decisive factor underlying biotic distributions. Five recent 460</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 461 contributions to the Darwin-Wallace tradition are reviewed here. Briggs' book is an attempt to subdivide the world's oceans into regions and provinces, mainly from the standpoint of fish distribution. Briggs considers some invertebrate groups as well, and each of the twelve chapters has an extensive bibli- ography dealing with the distribution of marine organisms. The book seems to have been inspired by, and invites comparison with, Ekman's Zoo- geography of the sea (1953). In order to define his geographical regions, Briggs considers (as pri- mary defining features?) physical features of the oceans, e.g., temperature, depth and current pat- terns, as well as the relative percentages of endemic species. Most of the areas defined are already familiar to the student of regional marine zoo- geography, but Briggs devotes considerable at- tention to defining exact boundaries between them. He discusses the barriers that separate regions in relation to his theory of unidirectional migration: "The realization that the East Pacific and Old World Land Barriers operate as one-way filters enables us to understand better how the Indo-West Pacific Region serves as the evolutionary and dis- tributional center for the tropical shore animals of the world. We can see that competitively dominant species continue to migrate, as they probably have for millions of years, from the Indo-West Pacific eastward across the open ocean to America and westward around the Cape of Good Hope into the Atlantic" (p. 114). The book is sparsely illustrated with maps and line drawings of marine organisms, chiefly fishes, some of which are originals. Carlquist's book is a handsomely illustrated ac- count of island life, mainly plants, written under the assumption that much or all of such life is the result of long-distance dispersal over water, and is, therefore, of special interest. Its first two chapters are entitled "Principles of Dispersal and Evolution" and "Long-Distance Dispersal: Evi- dence and Implications." Other chapters deal with local adaptive radiations, insular woodiness, loss of dispersibility, reproductive biology, and equa- torial highland biotas. Chapter 8 is devoted to the flora of Southwestern Australia in the belief that it "proves to be insular with respect to angio- sperms in many ways (p. 253)." Carlquist states (p. 1) that "To a surprising degree, the assessments which most appeal to me are those that confirm and extend the concepts of Darwin (1859) and Wallace (1880)," and Carlquist devotes little if any effort to consideration of alternatives. His attitude is well exemplified by the statement that "Still, when assessing floristic and faunistic com- position of islands and other areas, should we not begin by considering the positive hypothesis that dispersal over distances can occur, rather than beginning with a null hypothesis?" (p. 90). The work of Lindroth et al. deals with the history of a newly emerged volcanic island, born in November, 1963. Surtsey is the southwestern- most of the Westman Islands, situated some 29 kilometers off the south coast of Iceland. About half of the book is a checklist of the terrestrial invertebrates, mostly arthropods, known from Ice- land. The remainder of the work reports the results of collecting on Surtsey during the period 1964-1970, and a discussion of the means of dis- persal that might account for the 158 species of arthropods, and a few land plants, found there. The authors conclude (p. 272) that "Surtsey may be regarded as a standard example as far as overseas dispersal over moderate distance is con- cerned, not much disfavoured by the cool climate. But the island should not be looked upon as a model of colonization. Both climatic and edaphic factors make Surtsey adverse to a rapid settling of plants and animals. These procedures must be expected to proceed at a much higher rate in a warm climate and under less disturbed geomorpho- logical conditions." Krakatau has often been con- sidered the classic example of colonization in a warm climate, but Lindroth et al. note (p. 8) that "The case most worth-while to compare with Surtsey-notably from the biologist's point of view-is the famous one of Krakatau (Krakatoa). The main island of this group, in the Strait of Sunda between Java and Sumatra, was almost destroyed by an explosive volcanic eruption in 1883. The remaining southern third of the island was thought to have been completely sterilized (Dammerman, 1948) and the re-immigration of plants and animals was, though unfortunately a bit late, studied by Dutch biologists. Some doubts have, however, been launched as to whether the sterilization of Krakatau was complete (Backer, 1929)1 and the case is nowadays not accepted as 1 Backer, C. A. 1929.

It is, however, unfortunate that he has written his account with so much acrimony, not unrelated, it would appear, to the fact that he was 'Formerly,' as he states on the title page, 'Government Botanist for the Flora of Java.' His book deserves careful study, coming as it does from so critical a botanist, whose knowledge of the flora of Java exceeds that of any other worker in this field. It is therefore much to be regretted that it is marred by the as- persions which he has cast on distinguished bot- anists, both dead and living, whose contributions to the Krakatao eruption history have come to be regarded as classics. W\ihy Mr. Backer severed his</page><page sequence="3">462 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY a standard model of overseas immigration and colonization of biota." And in their footnote, Lindroth et al. add "It is remarkable that Dam- merman, in his large Krakatau book of 1948, did not discuss Backer's arguments; the paper of 1929 is not even listed in his bibliography." The work of the late Robert MacArthur, par- ticularly the book published in 1967 with E. 0. Wilson (The Theory of Island Biogeography) has enjoyed some vogue. The present book was in- tended as a text, organized into readable chapters, most of which have appendices dealing with math- ematical formulations of concepts such as adiabatic lapse rate, competition, predator-prey interactions, extinction probability, etc. In the preface (pp. xi-xii) MacArthur states that "The student who both learns the mathematics and reads from the bibliography, to complete a year's course, is ready to do research on his own." One cannot help but note the similarity between what MacArthur has done for biogeography, and what Sokal and Sneath have done for systematics: to provide a plausible, and mathematically elegant, exit from the doldrums of the past-not through penetration (and solu- tion) of long standing problems but rather through their circumvention. And one cannot help but feel that the exits are but temporary expedients. In- terestingly, both were predicated upon certain dubious assumptions inherent in the "received doctrine" of North American systematics, as exem- plified in the writings of Simpson, Mayr, Darling- ton, and others. For MacArthur it was the idea connexion with the Buitenzorg Herbarium, where he was botanist for so many years, we do not know, but it is to be regretted that he has chosen the medium of a scientific work as a vent for the eruption in print of his own pent-up feelings" (A. W. H. 1930. Nature 125:627-629); "Backer has apparently proved his case. It would seem that he might have done so more effectively in fifty pages than in three hundred-and we cannot suppress the intense desire to know what Dr. Docters van Leeuwen might say in reply" (Cooper, W. S. 1931. Ecology 12:424-426). One cannot help but note certain similarities in the work of Backer and Croizat (both were iconoclastic, some of both privately published) and the way they were received by certain elements of the scientific establishment (e.g., Carlquist, 1970. Quart. Rev. Biol. 45:425): "This lengthy essay [Croizat, 1968] is a testament to the fact that protracted personal statements still are being published. Croizat, the self-styled 'pan-biogeographer,' is perhaps more familiar to botanists and biogeographers as a sort of editorialist or commentator than as one who develops new information, data, or ideas." "Stu- dents of biogeography . . . may well prefer to go to the original data rather than view them through Croizat's outlook:" that biogeography is the science of dispersal (at the expense of vicariance, as discussed, e.g., by Croizat); for Sokal and Sneath, that systematics is the science of overall similarity and difference (at the expense of kinship, as discussed, e.g., by Hennig). Muller's book is, perhaps, the most interesting of the five. He attempts to delineate "dispersal centres" for terrestrial vertebrates (excluding fishes) of the Neotropical Region (including Galapagos but excluding the West Indies and Bahamas). By "dispersal centre" he means an area of general congruence of specific and subspecific distri- butions. In all, he finds some 40 centers, all but 3 of which (above the tree-line in the Andes) fall into two groups (p. 175): "1. The centres belong- ing to group I are connected with unforested areas . . . or with at least partly unforested areas below iSOOm. i.e., campos cerrados, savannas, deserts etc. 2. The centres belonging to group II lie in rain-forest areas . . . to which their faunal elements are adapted." The bulk of the book is a description, seriatim, of the 40 centers; the re- mainder discusses their significance: "Two ques- tions are therefore of great importance. Firstly, why do populations with such different levels of differentiation ["Monotypic genera, species of polytypic genera, and subspecies all occur together as elements of the same centre"] have ranges con- gruent with the same dispersal centre? And, secondly, how long can the species and subspecies by which a centre is recognised be considered as having been faunal elements of the centre?" (p. 182). Muller argues in favor of alternating wet and dry periods (in the Pleistocene), favoring, respectively, either expansion of the rain-forest biome (group II centers) or, alternatively, the campo (group I centers). Muller suggests that expansion and contraction, particularly of the rain- forest biome, have caused the present large species diversity: "most species of the Neotropical forest fauna evolved in forest refuges during arid phases" (p. 206). To some extent Muiller's work is an attempt to do for the neotropics what de Lattin (whom Muller acknowledges as his "teacher" [p. 5]) did for Holarctica. Muller contrasts the idea of a "dis- persal centre," or area of congruence ("'Areal- kerne' of Reinig" [p. 3]) with the "regional con- cept": "It [the dispersal-center approach] differs from the regional approach in being based solely and consistently on the geographical ranges of species and subspecies" (p. 25). Muiller concludes (p. 2) that "The analysis of dipersal centres offers a more satisfactory approach." His argument (p. 1) is that (1) "The anthropomorphic concept of the existence of sharply delimited faunal prov- inces-the regional concept-is put in doubt by the sheer complexity of the geographical ranges of species" and (2) "The regional concept stands</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 463 or falls with the demands that are made upon it. In the last analysis its problems are due to the fact that individuals have made a historical con- cept of it (Darlington, 1957). It is bad method- ology to assume that the centre of range of a group or its centre of greatest diversity need be its centre of origin, but many authors have made this as- sumption." Yet Muller makes demands, including historical ones, upon his concept of dispersal centers. Indeed, Muller's approach seems hardly less aprioristic than that, e.g., of Darlington. Muller nevertheless denies an aprioristic posture: "I do not assume at the outset that dispersal centres represent 'centres where faunas and floras were preserved during regressive phases' (de Lattin 1957, p. 402), nor even that their origin is con- nected with the Pleistocene. I do not wish to imply, a priori, that dispersal centres of particular taxa represent their centres of origin" (p. 3). But one suspects that Muller's denials are merely formal, for he ultimately embraces the propositions in question: "For polytypic species with mono- centric subspecies it can be shown that the dis- persal centres represent centres where terrestrial vertebrates were preserved during regressive phases of their environments, i.e., that they have acted in the past as refuge areas." "The position of dis- persal centres has been decisively influenced by Quaternary oscillations in climate and fluctuations in the vegetation" (pp. 205-206); among the arguments supporting such fluctuations Muller states that "Simpson's concept (1950) of inter- continental faunal exchange could only be made to work if correlated fluctuations in vegetation had occurred . . ." (p. 194). Indeed, the ultimate affirmation of propositions that he disavowed on an a priori basis is one of Muller's dominant stylistic elements: "When trying to work out, by using its subspecifically distinct faunal elements, the period when a dispersal centre last served as a refuge, it must first be recognized that sub- speciation rate does not provide a reliable time scale" vs. "The most recent period when a dis- persal centre acted as a refuge . . . can be worked out from the subspecific differentiation of the populations of a species which are confined to the centre by allopatry" and "it appears that the post- glacial period has been a long enough time for subspeciation in terrestrial vertebrates to occur" (p. 184); and "These examples do not show that all subspecifically distinct populations must have arisen in the post-glacial period . . ." vs. "It would not be too misleading to assume, prima facie, that the dispersal centres last acted as preservation centers for their faunas and floras within the post- glacial period" (p. 185). My purpose in reviewing these books is not to judge their merits within the Darwin-Wallace tra- dition, but rather to suggest that alternatives can no longer be ignored with impunity. Modern geo- physics, after all, has provided plausible mech- anisms for large-scale geographic change, such that one may consider that, on the whole, geog- raphy is no less labile than the distribution of life. So why not consider the possibility that a species acts passively to maintain its distribution, rather than aggressively to expand it? Indeed, to what extent does the present distribution of life reflect its passive response to geographic change gener- ally, from the origin of life to the present day? Are there, for instance, broad patterns of vicariance that might serve as a background and guide to the resolution of detail-such as Pleistocene dispersal phenomena? It seems to me that few modern bio- geographers, with the notable exception of Leon Croizat, have seriously and critically explored such possibilities. And while the five books reviewed here may have merit, of whatever relative amount, within the Darwin-Wallace tradition, is that tra- dition really sufficient? It is no coincidence that the works of Croizat are unmentioned in four of the five books (and that the one work cited once by Muller [p. 181] is mentioned in a trivial sense). As examples of alternative possibilities, one might entertain the propositions (1) that the "con- centrations of species in the comparatively small triangle formed by the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula, and New Guinea" (Briggs, 1974:14), far from being "a faunistic center from which the other subdivisions of the Indo-West Pacific Region [and "the tropical shore . . . of the world"] re- cruited their faunas" is no more than a zone of mixing of different faunal elements; (2) that it is simply no longer tenable to assume with Carl- quist (1974:45) that "Older islands known to have been strongly isolated for very long periods of time (New Zealand, New Caledonia) have received an appreciable portion and probably the vast ma- jority of their immigrants by long-distance dis- persal"; (3) that if "An ultimate, balanced eco- system [on Surtsey] will no doubt be of a similar type to that on the plateaus of the other small Westman islands" (Lindroth et al., 1973:1)- however interesting the process of this island's colonization might be in detail-then the result in principle would be no more significant than the ultimate fate of a sterilized plot of earth in one's own backyard (I say this not because Lindroth et al. have explicitly claimed otherwise, but because others, to judge from the history of the general interest in Krakatau, surely will); (4) that "Al- though it seems a departure from the Darwin- Wallace line of natural history, the book by Mac- Arthur and Wilson (1967), The Theory of Insular Biogeography [sic], is a natural product of these lines of enquiry" (Carlquist, 1974:1), and as such may suffer under the same limited perspectives; and (5) that the answer to "why . . . populations with such different levels of [taxonomic] differenti- ation have ranges congruent with the same dis-</page><page sequence="5">464 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY persal centre?" (MMuller, 1973:182) is not because of temporally different episodes of invasion and colonization, but rather the vagaries of Simpsonian- Mayrian "evolutionary taxonomy" (according to which, taxa of the same absolute age may be dif- ferently ranked-as e.g., subspecies, species, or monotypic genera-and, indeed, must be if they have diverged at apparently different rates). These alternatives do not exhaust the possi- bilities. Croizat has considered many more through- out the several thousand pages that he has already published on the subject-a collected work that in the history of science is probably the most thorough indictment of an established school, or "tradition" in the Darwin-Wallace sense. I can only marvel at the capacity of this particular tra- dition to absorb and dismiss, with as little public comment as possible, the best efforts of one of its best and most constructive (and most dangerous?) critics.-Gareth Nelson. I Notices Research in Chihuahuan Desert.-All concerned biologists having knowledge of any biological re- search completed, in progress, or being planned for the Chihuahuan Desert Region, including Southwestern Texas, Southern New Mexico, South- eastern Arizona (Wilcox Playa), and the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, San Luis Potosi and NW Hidalgo in Mexico are asked to contact: John A. Bissonette, School of Natural Resources, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 relating researcher's name, affiliation (if known), research title and date(s) of research, locality, and brief description of research if possible. This infor- mation is being compiled in conjunction with the first annual Symposium on the Biological Resources of the Chihuahuan Desert Region to be held October 16-18, 1974 at Sul Ross State University in Alpine Texas. It is our intent to provide a clearinghouse for all biological work done in the Chihuahuan Desert Region and to publish a re- search reference. The list will be cross-referenced, collated, and updated periodically. It will be made available to all interested biologists. All respon- dents will receive acknowledgement and will be sent a copy when the list is completed. Responses welcome anytime. Do not be restrained by the Symposium date.-J. A. Bissonette. Community Concept.-A special interest group titled "The Community Concept: Ecologically and Palaeoecologically" met as one of the many func- tions of the First International Congress of Syste- matic and Evolutionary Biology last August in Boulder. An edited version of the taped pro- ceedings of this group form a "Community" News- letter which is available to interested persons from R. R. West, Palaeobiological Laboratory, Depart- ment of Geology, Kansas State University, Man- hattan, Kansas, 66506.-Ronald R. West. International Commission.-In order to make clear the present status of the International Com- mission on Zoological Nomenclature, it seems worthwhile to reprint certain material from News- letter number 4 (p. 17) of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), published in December, 1973. The XVIIIth General As- sembly of IUBS, referred to in this material, was held in September, 1973, in Ustaoset, Norway. Zoological Nomenclature: Whereas the future of the International Zoological Congresses is still unsettled, the long and difficult process of trans- ferring the authority over the code of Zoological Nomenclature has been brought to a conclusion, as the XVIIIth General Assembly of IUBS accepted this authority. This was done, partly through the adoption of two resolutions, one submitted by the Division of Zoology, the other by the committee on Admissions and Structure, and partly through the acceptance of the Commission of Zoological Nomenclature and its statutes. The two resolutions read as follows: 1. The General Assembly noting the resolution of the XVIIth International Congress of Zoology inviting the International Union of Biological Sciences to accept authority over the International Commission on Zoological Nomen- clature and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, resolved that IUBS accept this authority and delegate it to the Division of Zoology of IUBS. 2. In view of the essential nature of the work of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the interruption and probable termination of its former parent body, the International Congresses of Zoology, the com- mittee on Admissions and Structure recommends the establishment of a section on Zoological No- menclature in the Division of Zoology. The ad hoc committee wishes to commend the Executive Committee of IUBS for making the necessary ar- rangements for the transfer of ICZN, and further and especially compliments Drs. Farner, Melville, Baer and Ride on their careful work in this con- nection.--C. D. Michener.</page></plain_text>
