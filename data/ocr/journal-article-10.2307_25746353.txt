ISBN: 978-0-8166-5046-0 (pbk), 978-0-8166-5045-3 (hbk). The explorations in When Species Meet converge in advocating an 'alternative globalization' (p. 3): creating a future world that resembles a global ecology rather than a monoculture. To this end, Donna Haraway endeavors to navigate between the polarities of, on the one hand, love of organic nature (often coupled with suspicion of technologies) and, on the other, love of cyborgs (often taken to make one an enemy of pristine nature). She stays loyal to the cyborg (as 'hopeful monster'), theoretically enlarging it into the neologism of 'natureculture' that permeates her text. In the world of natureculture, she tells us, there is ample room, figu ratively and literally, for both lapdog and laptop on the same lap (p. 10). The text argues that good theorizing and ethical practice are worked out in the messiness of 'mortal entangle ments', and not through the imposition of ideologies or agendas that tend to float above the complexities of the lifeworld. The author agitates for a 'chance of getting on together with some grace' (p. 15), expressed elsewhere as the desire for the 'co-flourishing of companion species' (passim). The means are unassuming but profound: co-flourishing does not arise primarily through implementing regulations, norms, or abstract principles, but by cultivating 'respect and response' - bundled together in Haraway's evocation of respecere, 'looking back [and] holding in regard' (p. 88). The text's ontological refrain is that we always 'become with' others, not only humans of course but all sorts of nonhumans as well. Nothing is barred from this co-becoming, including technologies, creatures, landscapes, and practices. Symbiogenesis, in both biological and social worlds, is the rule not the exception; to acknowl edge and embrace this promises moving toward an alternative globalization. Such medita tions run through a collage of chapters (topics), keeping otherwise dissimilar explorations fairly well integrated. Haraway's commitments are incompatible with 'human exceptionalism' - the imperial exaltation of the human above the dance of Earthly life.

'If we appreciate the foolishness of human excep tionalism', she writes, 'then we know that becoming is always becoming with9 (p. 244, emphasis in original). Inside instrumental relations, such as those that often involve pain and suffering of laboratory animals, human exceptionalism remains smug, giving itself license not to look back and not to think twice. Indeed, instrumental relations in which animals are used constitute a definite and perpetual challenge for the chance of getting on together with grace. Instrumental relations in themselves, Haraway avers, are not the problem. They cannot be the problem because they are inevitable in 'webbed mortal earthly being and becoming' (p. 71). She thus steers clear of an in-principle condemnation of instrumental relations, for 'to be in relation of use to each other is not the definition of unfreedom and violation' (p. 74). The question comes down to this: if we have to use, how do we use responsibly and ethically? It will surprise no one that this is a complicated question that no regulative appa ratus can fully resolve. (Plenty of regulations and guidelines about using animals are needed, however, some of which Haraway offers in general terms. It is also the case that 'some instrumental relations should be ended' [p. 77].) For Haraway the ethics of using, when using we must, is about (perhaps oversimplifying) the cultivation of heart: the will ingness to stay face-to-face with and share suffering; to sustain a 'radical ability to remem ber and feel what is going on' (p. 75); always to ask for a forgiveness that cannot be granted; to know that no balance sheet of cost and benefits can absolve action that causes pain, suf fering, and/or death; to remain intimate with the knowledge that killing is never innocent. No general principles can deliver the epistemological, emotional, technical, pragmatic, and ethical requirements of exacting the labor of sentient beings within asymmetrical contexts. This kind of unequal relation cannot be made good through codification, nor abolished by means of radical political theory/action (such as that of animal rights). Instrumental rela tions call for something more nebulous, but perhaps also more authentic: an alternative form of life, namely, the willingness and ability to 'stay in the open' (passim). How can laboratory practices be 'less deadly, less painful, and freer' (p. 77)? It is not simply that Haraway poses the question; more to the point, she wants laboratory practi tioners to pose it. Ultimately, she is calling for a new culture (laboratory as well as wider) within which questions of this nature can be posed in real time and as a matter of course. Such a culture would not be governed by the impossible proscription 'Thou Shalt Not Kill', but by the plausible and achievable command 'Thou Shalt Not Make Killable' (p. 80). The making killable (which our culture endorses in spades) undergirds, according to Haraway, the gigantic, systematized violence against animals that has reached unprece dented levels in the (post)industrial world. It is the making killable of billions of animals, and of innumerable kinds of animals, that also ensures the fact that all the killing remains below most people's radar screens. Steering clear of the human exceptionalism that turns a blind eye to this ubiquitous and mundane violence, without buying into its alter ego that wants to transfer the western idiom of rights to animals, Haraway struggles to articulate a position of 'staying in the open' within unavoidable instrumental bonds; 'we can never</page><page sequence="3">Crist 643 do without technique, without calculation, without reasons, but these practices will never take us into that kind of open where multispecies responsibility is at stake' (p. 81). What she advocates, if I understand correctly, is a politicized form of ethnomethodology that forsakes Big Principles, Ethical Universals, and Grand Theory in favor of messy engage ments, 'imaginative polities', never fully resolvable quandaries, emotional risks, and 'permanent complexity' - coupled with unswerving reflexivity and compassion in the midst of it all. There is no time-out from being worldly, and the seeking of such time-out is perhaps the secret dream of most forms of abstraction. To always be in response - with respect not only to laboratory animals, but also with the ones we live with and perhaps breed or train, as well as with other kinds of beings touched upon in When Species Meet - means staying alert, not avoiding, and being with out excuses. It is within open presence (physical, emotional, and spiritual) that love is born and endures. Absentmindedness, complacency, excuses, and evading emotional dis comfort (practiced long enough) harbor the end of love, or its impossibility. 'To be in love means to be worldly, to be in connection with significant otherness and signifying others' (p. 97). Haraway here happens to be talking about dogs, which, for some of us at least, is a stimulating philosophical excursion. Only people who have fallen in love with an animal, or with the animal kingdom as such, can understand the intimations brimming in the phrase that Haraway cites and reiterates - that animals enrich our ignorance. A chapter on the genetics of dog breeding examines 'how heterogeneous sorts of expertise and caring are required to craft and sustain scientific knowledge for the benefit of kinds of dogs, as well as individual pooches, within a particular, noninnocent, natural cultural context' (p. 128). It details how practitioners meld devotion, energy, courage, politics, knowledge, and technical savvy to negotiate the challenging terrain of dog breed ing, where suffering (caused by the mishap of pairing recessive al?eles) must be avoided and diversity (somehow) sustained, while 'pure lines' are reproduced: all for love of the breed and the dogs, and not for turning a profit. Haraway weaves a familiar science stud ies narrative of the politics and thought of lay expertise, with a less familiar ingredient of passionate advocacy for an ethics of co-flourishing. Reproducing the working breed of Australian shepherd dogs (who will suffer from epilepsy, for example, as a consequence of inbreeding or care-less breeding) thus becomes thematically continuous with the examination of laboratory animal life (in the preceding chapter) and the life of industri ally grown chickens (in one that follows). Working for the co-flourishing of companion species thus has multiple meanings - from staying present with suffering, to promoting full disclosure of genetic information on dog lines, to querying how animals that end up at the dinner table ought to be grown and treated. 'If science studies scholars have learned anything in the last decades', Haraway main tains, 'it is that the categorical dualism between society and science, culture and nature, is a setup to block a grasp of what is going on in technoculture, including what is to be done in order that companion animals flourish' (p. 136). Closer to the truth, I think, is that science studies scholarship has always been more comfortable on terrain where tech noculture is solidly operational - terrain that is, without end in sight, taking over more and more of the world field. That is why it is not surprising that while the title of one of the chapters ('Cloning Mutts, Saving Tigers') seems to promise that tigers will get 50% of the attention, they only get perfunctory representation. An other-centered ethic, however,</page><page sequence="4">644 Social Studies of Science 40(4) would demand that we do not turn a sustained theoretical and political gaze away from the plight of the tiger - who is, after all, a poster case of the other. It is a legitimate ques tion to ask whether 'the tiger' (now in quotes as a stand-in for Earthly otherness, such as it is, today) wants any truck with our naturecultures or our technocultures, or has much interest in becoming with us. Questions about co-flourishing tack a different course here, as they (re)ignite themes of loving from afar, looking back from a distance, showing respect by means of discretion, and drawing principled limits on instrumentalism. Because these themes conjure and involve unhitching the 'natural' and the 'cultural', the 'human' and the 'nonhuman', they remain much un- and under-pondered in all discur sive domains (including most social theory) save a fraction of the environmental. But a genuine interest in the plight of the other (and in the plight of otherness - for an immense chunk of the category itself is critically endangered) demands sufficient openness to challenge the theorized and real-worldly fusions echoed in such concepts as hybrid, cyborg, natureculture, technoculture, and even technoscience. It is a telling and, I think, unin tended irony of such mergers that they adumbrate the homogenized and colonized planet that has always been the nightmare destination of human exceptionalism. While consid ering the (literal and discursive) de-construction of the above fusions, we might simulta neously contemplate breathing new life and theoretical energy into the maligned (by a heavy diet of constructivism) concepts of 'intrinsic being' and 'intrinsic value'. To enlarge the ethical regard across many species, including the 'more-than-human world', is the direction in which Haraway moves her readers. Her frontal attack on human supremacy (the ideological handmaiden of exceptionalism) is in dialogue with many other practitioners of anthropology, biology, animal behavior science, philosophy, dog cultures, and ecofeminism. This provides for a rich conversational landscape, and makes the footnote sections of the book as lively to read as the main text. 'Human excep tionalism is what companion species cannot abide', she writes (p. 165). Exceptionalism has always been propped by discourses of difference, in which nonhumans have vari ously been denied sentience, soul, mind, language, self-consciousness, technology, morality, or what-have-you. 'The philosophic and literary conceit that all we have is representations and no access to what animals think and feel is wrong' (p. 226). The chapter 'Training in the Contact Zone' is not only a personal ethnography of training with dogs in the sport of agility, but also an essay on the availability of nonhuman mind. The mind of the dog shows itself in work, play, focus, and forms of action and commu nication performed for their own sake. Mind reveals itself within an intersubjective field through interlocking gestures, eyes, and movements - forms of being and becoming together. This domain of mind is something philosophical and behaviorist traditions have often failed to grant significance to, as they strain to portray mind as an inner domain either unavailable to observation and representation or irrelevant to the shaping of behavior. The greater the separation superimposed between human observer and animal subject - the thicker the theories, the more rigid the methods, and the more entrenched the (human istic) skepticism - the more animal mind disappears behind such ostensible lenses that are actually screens. The epistemological value of the performative sport of agility that Haraway describes lies in revealing the dog's mind, transparent and alive in ways that cannot be ignored within a 'reciprocity of inductions', a coordination of movements, and the shared</page><page sequence="5">Crist 645 emotional wavelengths of joy, disappointment, excitement, listlessness, enthusiasm, and the like. This experiential, lived, and invited (by the animal) alternative approach to mind is explored earlier through Barbara Smuts' connection with her baboon subjects (Smuts, 1999). Smuts understood that she had to let go of stiff methodological protocols and subject-object (in the name of 'objectivity') separation, if she were to gain the baboons' trust and actually learn something intimate about their lives. Interestingly enough, this shift required her to acknowledge mind before she could study mind (meaning, animal life). Here is Smuts, quoted in When Species Meet: I... in the process of gaining their trust, changed almost everything about me, including the way I walked and sat, the way I held my body, and the way I used my eyes and voice. I was learning a whole new way of being in the world - the way of baboon ... I was responding to the cues the baboons used to indicate their emotions, motivations and intentions to one another, (p. 24) Such words incite a broader appreciation of the diversity of nonhuman minds on Earth that enrich not only our ignorance but also our knowledge. Smuts' words also disclose something about the beauty of science, the ways it becomes forced to flex and reinvent itself, since its commitment to knowing the world, sooner or later, trumps loyalties to historical forms of method, theory, or baggage of assumptions. When Species Meet, Haraway tells us, is 'about the entanglements of beings in techno culture that work through reciprocal inductions to shape companion species' (p. 281). Regarding companion species, she writes mostly, though not exclusively, about animals we live with. At the same time, she insists on the importance of keeping the notion of 'companion species' amorphous - flexible enough to contain such diverse entities as technological assemblages, college students, and humpback whales. I beg to differ in theoretical taste from this form of conceptual plasticity which, I think, can vitiate good theorizing and compromise the possibility of liberatory politics. What do we gain if categories are blurred to such an extent that we do not, or might not, know what we are talking about? How do we begin to draw important distinctions, if all sorts of things and beings are compounded in an indistin guishable heap? How can we intelligently theorize the difference between, for instance, 'becoming with' Disneyland and (versus) 'becoming with' Tennessee's Smoky Mountains? Becoming with my lapdog and (versus) becoming with SimPet? And so on. Of course we might always draw crisper pictures through ethnographies or case studies, but categorical fusions and over-inclusiveness bar, as I will now argue, certain forms of critical theory. This world we live in is, in vast measure, a world of natureculture; and a great deal of the problem with this world is precisely that. Let's call today's immense and indetermi nate nature-culture-social-technical complex the melting pot. Human beings take the melting pot for granted, since it represents the preponderance of their experience of being in the world. When intellectuals, in turn, proceed to take the melting pot as a theoretical starting point, they furnish the taken-for-granted with an additional layer of concretiza tion: this is what is known in critical theory as 'reification', one of the most potent forms of ideology known to (wo)man. Within the melting pot, people entirely (and I do mean almost entirely) lose sight, for example, of the plight of the chicken in the factory farm. Interestingly enough, even if that plight is revealed - as Haraway does in a chapter called 'Chicken' - the revelation itself is insufficient to make people change how they live (eat).</page><page sequence="6">646 Social Studies of Science 40(4) The reason being exactly because nature and culture have been soldered together within people's experiential fields: natureculture is the hegemonic ontology. But gaining critical leverage on the world requires us to challenge that taken-for-granted ontology - not echo it. One significant dimension of composing critical theory must, therefore, involve decou pling 'natureculture', so as to de-reify its repressions, perversities, forms of violence, estrangements, and so forth - all those undesirable manifestations of natureculture that are too entrenched to be visible even in open view. Natureculture is what we live with, but hope for an alternative globalization does not lie in the continued swelling of the melting pot. Hope lies instead in distinguishing where the meshing is good, where it produces cruelty, where it harbors disease, where it is unavoid able, where it colonizes the human mind, and where divorce is occasion to celebrate. The devil is in the details no doubt, but a first intellectual step is to affirm that what we (still) have, and what we desire to have, is natures, cultures, and naturecultures. Diversity, indeed.
