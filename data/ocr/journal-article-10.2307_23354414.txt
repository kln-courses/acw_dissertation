<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dennis Ford, The Search for Meaning: A Short History. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. 290 pp. Dennis Ford argues that questions about the existence of God and life after death are at root questions about meaning.1 But the question of meaning does not have just one answer. It is a central and defining question in both religion and philosophy. Pragmatism and postmodernism have undermined the conventional division between objective and subjective knowledge. The persistence and tenacity exhibited by opponents to evolution express an unwillingness to accept the meaninglessness implied by the proposition that we are here for no other reason or higher purpose than random selection. The greatest fear of liberals is fanaticism, just as the greatest fear of conservatives is meaninglessness. Our culture leaves large areas of choice and belief open where preferences are arbitrary. Conformity and authoritarianism are collective strategies for relieving the anxiety that freedom elicits. The notion of the Absurd arose when mankind's desire for meaning and purpose confronted an indifferent universe that the skeptical tradition projected. The sacred relation as articulated by myth is universal, impersonal, timeless, and transcendent. As a consequence, the reality of the day-to-day becomes secondary to the enduring and eternal reality of the sacred. Knowing about the myth is different from living within it. We are heirs to the Enlighten ment which sees faith as "blind," "naive," or "fanatical." From inside the myth the question of meaning never arises, for myth is identification. It gives direction. Eliade argues that "the majority of men 'without religion' still hold to pseudo-religious and degenerate mythologies."2 As an example of this Eliade cites the mythological structure and archetypal content of Marxism. The Just (the "chosen," the "annointed," the "innocent," in our day the proletariat) are destined to change the ontological status of the world. In fact, Marx's classless society and the consequent disappearance of habitual tensions found their closest precedent in the myth of the Golden Age that many traditions put at the beginning or at the end of history.3 Eliade finds what he calls "degenerate forms of myth" in war, individual combat, 1 Ford, p. xii.

For a person living within the myth, the rise of the proletariat or alternatively of psychoanalysis is rational and objectively descriptive of what is the case. Within myth, the question of whether I should go to war when my country calls is never asked. Hay den White persuasively argues that all history, no matter how seemingly objective, is a combination of fact and generic story form that encodes or configures data into the familiar story types of our culture. Historiography thus "constructs" the objects which it pretends only to describe realistically and to analyze objectively.4 We understand or find meaning in facts to the extent that they yield to and are identified with the myths available in our culture. These stories—myths —not only configure existing facts, they determine what facts we seek out and notice.5 There is no noninterpreted experience. Mythical thinking testifies that image and example move us more than concept and argument. We know, says Ford, not by knowing about myth but by living mythically (p. 47). We can ask of myths whether they are alive or dead, compelling or boring, but not whether they are true or false. Faith and commitment are more characteristic of mythical thinking than are doubt and skepticism. Myth is our original condition; it is the world in which we live before we ask whether life has meaning. From this perspective which seems to us a movement from myth and superstition to reason and causality (which has been called the Enlightenment myth) is actually a movement from one myth to another, albeit secular, myth. Meaninglessness is impossible because we are always within a myth, even if that myth is saying that life is meaningless. The myth of philosophy and modernity makes us distrust the older myths of gods and anthropomorphic forces. Nihilism as explained in the existential stories of Camus, Beckett, and Vonnegut, is itself a culminating mythology of a long skeptical tradition which holds that there is no meaning in an otherwise objective and material universe without purpose. Ironically, the meaning of a meaningless universe is itself a way of infusing meaning into the experience of meaninglessness. According to this myth, we gain authenticity, dignity, and meaning by honestly and bravely accepting that the universe is without intrinsic meaning. Meaning is the price we pay for self 4 Hayden White, Tropics of Discourse (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 2. 5 Ibid., p. 86.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 297 consciousness. This implies that a strategy of living mythically is vulnerable and fragile, fanatical and dangerous. The heart of the philosophic mind is discontent. The Greeks were perhaps the first to see the world as a question to be answered.6 The philosophic mind is not content with disorder and changing appearances (p. 57). It is also not content with the capriciousness and lack of predictability exhibited by the mythic mind. It seeks a stable universal order behind the kaleidoscope of appearances. Knowing what justice demands challenges our self-interest and provides an abstract standard against which to judge the actions of ourselves and others, including the gods. Politically this is the rule of law in contrast to the rule of capricious men and gods. Discontent with the seeming randomness of life can be overcome through dialectic and a process of abstraction. Virtue and Beauty per se must be abstracted from the particular sensual embodiments. Opinion is acquaintance and engagement with the realm of changing appearances. Knowledge, on the other hand, is grasping the story's "theme," "meaning," or "essence" beneath the surface of particulars. It is what we say when somebody asks us what the story is "about." Ironically, notwithstanding his criticism of the poet's mythic mind, Plato uses the poetic myth of the cave to express the movement from opinion to knowledge. The abstract concepts of Equality and Justice continue to seduce and inspire our actions and ignite social movements. But something in us rebels against the impersonality of the Forms and we are post-Platonic and conflicted. The philosophic mind separates the knower from the known, the subject from the object, unreflective imitation and action from contemplation and reflection. The philosophic mind recognizes that life pulls us in different directions. Abstractions, conceptions of an ideal or just society provide hope of a world that is beyond anything we or anyone else has actually seen (p. 71). Socrates (like all the martyrs) could calmly accept death because philosophy had taught him that this world of appearances, including the appearance of death, is ultimately unreal. Meaning is predominantly a question of the philosophic mind. It goes beyond the bright surfaces characteristic of the mythic mind. Thus hidden beyond the many roles I play in life as a child, a son, a brother, a father, a husband, and an old man, there persists an "I" that all these roles share. The 6 Richard Tarnas, The Passions of the Western Mind (New York: Ballantine Books, 1993), p. 69.</page><page sequence="4">298 Book Reviews philosophic mind is the mind that asks: What do these different appearances have in common? Meaninglessness occurs when the realm of Forms or Ideas seems unreal and literally unsubstantial. Often a consequence of radical pluralism, nominalism is the doctrine that concepts are convenient, humanly created categories that do not have a separate higher reality or ontological status than the realm of appearances. Theologically, the death of the Forms anticipated the death of God (p. 78). We are philosophers, but we are also poets with animal bodies that need to be satisfied. Because any context is always transitory and specific, whereas Forms are not, our connection to the philosophic mind is tenuous and susceptible to being broken. A rebellion against the impersonality, asceticism, and severe intellectualism of the philosophic mind characterizes the romantic movement that arose in response to the post-Platonic mind of modernity (p. 79). To our senses the earth seems immovable while the sun rises and sets. The movement of the stars appears to our senses entirely unrelated to the falling of an apple. The knowledge that comes to us through our senses is thus demonstrably particular, contradictory, and untrustworthy (p. 85). Only the measurable "objective" qualities are to be considered primary, whereas the perceptible qualities are to be ignored for being subjective and ephemeral. For the scientific mind, "all that mattered is matter."7 The distinction between appearance and reality is not new. What is new is the definition (reduction?) of reality to the primary qualities that are describable in mathematical and mechanical terms. Understanding is translated or is reduced to causes. In contrast to Aristotle, the scientific mind denies final causes and thus purpose to the universe. In doing so, it moves from metaphysics to physics, from ends to origins. The scientific mind is concerned with how things work or happen rather than why or toward what end or purpose they do so (p. 90). Whereas Aristotle uses biological metaphors to articulate his notions of growth and movement towards purposeful ends, the scientific mind saw the world in terms of clocks and machines. Science is based, above all, on intersubjective agreement. Scientific thinking, no matter how intellectually appealing, is incomplete as science until it contains an experiment to prove whether it is true or false. For Newton stars became machines, and for Descartes animals are machines. For Hobbes, society is a machine, and for La Mettrie 7 Floyd W. Matson, The Broken Image: Man, Science, and Society (New York: George Braziller, 1964), p. 27.</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 299 the human body is a machine. For Pavlov and Skinner human behavior is mechanical.8 Darwin and his successors traced the evolution of mankind to simpler and earlier forms of life and eventually to their chemical components. Marx reduced human history and idealism (including religion) to impersonal economic forces. Freud maintained that beneath the conscious mind we are driven by nonrational forces. Things are not what they seem. "Fact" became the ultimate honorific title designating genuine and substantiated knowledge, as distinct from either belief or opinion The scientific "fact" ends debate (p. 96). We know science is true because it works. The ability of science not only to understand but to demonstrably change conditions for the better provides a basis for the notion of progress. Scientists feel as though they are discoverers, not merely changing the perspectives and opinions. But science deals only with those problems that are amenable to its methods. Empiricism means offering evidence that others can see and agree with. All phenomena, including ideas and beliefs, are explainable in terms of matter and causal sequence. In the end, science—or more accurately, scientism—is a monolithic faith claiming that it is not only a path but the only path to truth. Freedom in such a world is the recognition of necessity (p. 100). Analogies taken from nature, such as Darwinian survival of the fittest, become the basis of social and economic policy. The attractiveness of the environmentalist movement is that, in a universe without value or purpose, it provides universal values and meaning. The teleological end is taken as human survival. In the postmodern world there is no higher aim underlying objective reality to which our ideas can easily correspond. The beginnings of postmodernism go back to the early days of the modern era. Empiricism had stressed that everything in the world originates in the senses and ultimately, in the plethora of chaotic impressions. Kant argued that in the act of human cognition, the mind does not conform to things; rather things conform to the mind. But most people, most of the time, assumed that there was an inherent structure in nature—a natural law—because acting on that assumption was immensely fruitful (p. 115). After Kant, the task of philosophy very much became an attempt to understand and articulate how the mind structured experience. Some found experience-informing structures in language (structuralism in all its guises), while others looked for the shaping influences of historical 8 Huston Smith, Beyond the Postmodern Mind (Wheaton 111.: Theosophical Pub. House, 2003), p. 180.</page><page sequence="6">300 Book Reviews epochs and "forms of life." All these movements share the postmodern assumption that order is a human product. Postmodernism comes full circle by introducing the telos and purpose that science banished, only in this case the purpose does not reside in nature or God, Forms or sacred texts, but in human intentions, even if these intentions are often subconscious (ibid.). In the end, postmoderns moved beyond Kant and his heirs—proclaiming that there is no universal or permanent order. The discoveries associated with the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics in particular helped undermine classical science and its assumptions (p. 116). Relativity introduced us to a counterintuitive universe by holding that mass, time, and distance are relative to the frame of reference of the observer. For relativity there is no absolute, universal dimension of space, time, and mass. Heisenberg experimentally demonstrated that we could not simultaneously know both a particle's velocity and its position, and that therefore uncertainty is built into the universe as an epistemological limit. We cannot observe nature without disturbing it. Quantum theory, like relativity, blurs the classical distinction between subjects and autonomous objects (p. 118). Bohr's principle of complementarity states that a single conceptual model or description may not be adequate to explain atomic behavior. Sometimes matter behaves as though it consists of particles, whereas at other times it behaves as though it is a wave. Complementarity reinforces relativity and uncertainty by holding that there is no single description of reality; all our descriptions are necessarily partial and informed by specific intentions and purposes (p. 119). Postmodern science has thus discovered that the classical science of Newton is only "true for people-sized perceptions."9 According to Thomas Kuhn, objective data are always seen from within an established paradigm of expectations and assumptions which determines which data are collected, how they are collected, and the use to which they are put.10 As a result, all data are "theory-laden."11 Scientific revolutions occur whenever there is a shift from one paradigm to another. The choice between paradigms is not entirely rational, the world is genuinely pluralistic 9 Bryan Appleyard, Understanding the Present: Science and the Soul of Modern Man (New York: Doubleday, 1993), p. 144. 10 Thomas S.

There is no single answer. As a consequence, the decision to work within one paradigm rather than another is as dependent upon custom, aesthetics, root metaphors, and sociological factors as it is on tests and arguments. Postmodernism is mistrustful of looking at "facts" in isolation and assuming that they either speak for themselves or mark the end of the debate. Facts, as well as meaning, require contexts (p. 122). The objective, value-neutral world the scientific paradigm revealed and articulated was itself seen to be but one of many possible worlds, a social construction for specific and limited purposes. Science may work, but pragmatism is no guarantee of truth. If there is no objective way to determine right and wrong views, then only power remains for deciding whose perspective will prevail. For the postmodernist, our ideas and symbols do not correspond to reality; they produce reality through an act of interpretation and construction in which we select and reify one of many possible worlds according to our social and individual needs. Poverty, for example, casts a very different shadow if one interprets it as being caused by oppression and discrimination rather than by lack of merit and initiative. Postmodernism abandons the search for a timeless universal truth in favor of being more self-conscious and transparent about our local motives and intentions. Pluralism and diversity go all the way down; there is no foundation. For postmodernists, subjective and objective cannot be conveniently or easily distinguished. If the modern mind replaces metaphysics with physics, the postmodern mind replaces physics by psychology and the informing role of archetypes, symbols and conceptual presuppositions. In so doing, postmodernism goes beyond modernism by returning us to the intentional and informing power of myth and ideas. The meaning and teleological universe that are banished from science are returned to us in the form of our own desires and goals. Truth exists within a paradigm but not between paradigms. From this perspective we cannot say that religion is truer than science, or vice versa, we can only say that religion works in fulfilling some needs, while science works in fulfilling others. For postmodernists totalitarianism is a greater threat than is nihilism (p. 131). Truth cannot be established according to a single grammar, logic, or system of symbols. Postmodernism is an insistent antidote of religious fundamentalism, ideological fanaticism, social intolerance, and political totalitarianism. But the freedom to choose is pointless if no choice is worth</page><page sequence="8">302 Book Reviews making. A tolerance of plurality of precepts degenerates into indifference when all inputs are equally groundless and arbitrary. Reality is socially constructed over time and within specific communities. We create worlds through a process of selection and emphasis. Truth, for James, is instrumental.12 The notion of religious truth is to be judged by the extent to which it leads to a "larger, richer, more satisfying life."13 Implied by this view is that truths can change and become false, if they cease to be instrumental in providing satisfying consequences. Truth is inseparable from who we are, our particular institutions and way of life. Many religions, many cultures, many values, many languages, many ways of understanding the course of history, many theories and paradigms about the fundamental nature of the universe—all attest to a pluralistic universe. These differences cannot be explained by saying that one reality is more fundamental, more advanced, or more primitive than another and that eventually we'll all agree to what is eternally and universally real and good. We do not see or grasp reality directly but only as it is mediated by notions, concepts, and symbols, including especially language. Reality is not something we "discover," but something we at least partially fabricate through the mediation of our cultural symbols (p. 160). Knowledge requires engagement and active verification that is created, not discovered ready-made (p. 161). The hypothesis of a meaningful universe cannot be substantiated objectively; it must be verified by our commitments and actions. Perhaps the question of meaning cannot be resolved by thinking about it. If so, philosophy and self-conscious deliberate thought may need to give way to myth, story, and intrinsically satisfying experiences (p. 167). Our needs are subconscious as well as conscious. Our most fundamental ideas and root metaphors are expressions of persons.14 The Great systems reveal the structure of our thoughts and emotions. Unlike Forms or myths, archetypes do not depend on belief in either a supernatural or a metaphysical realm. Reason and idealistic categories are not a transcendent feature of the universe or of a disembodied mind; they are rooted in our physical bodies. Reflection reveals that we are compelled 12 William James, Writings, 1902-1910 (New York: Literary Classics of the United States, Viking, 1987), pp. 574-75. 13 Ibid. p. 453. 14 James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975), p. 25.</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews 303 and constrained by forces we do not fully control; we fall in and out of love, we are subject to figments of the imaginations and prejudices that seem beyond our conscious ability to change. There are forces in our lives (as well in our societies) that we cannot fully control. Myths give our rationality a significant context. The taken for granted world of the everyday conceals a hidden deeper reality. We symptomatically do things we don't want to do and don't do things we wish we could. Archetypal psychology radically challenges the Enlightenment ideal (or more accurately, the Enlightenment archetype) of the fully conscious, autonomous, rational individual. Inspired by archetypal stories of what it means to be a soldier, young men courageously and stoically go into battle. The devil's vilest trick is to convince us that he does not exist. Alienation, anomie, nihilism, meaninglessness, a pervasive spiritual malaise—these have become a recurring theme as the age of reason has given way to the age of anxiety. The constricted worldview of science has brought alienation. A person who restricts his attention to merely what can be counted, measured, and weighted lives necessarily in a very poor world. Our world is meaningless because we are concerned with a level of reality whose meaning cannot be sustained (p. 198). The heart of science, and the materialism on which it rests, is the motivation to control. If a quality does not demonstrably contribute to prediction and control, it is ignored. Science is thus selective about that to which it is attentive. Eventually indifference to the secondary qualities (taste, smell, color, and touch residing within the human subject) becomes denial and science becomes scientism. Science begins by saying it can answer only pragmatic and instrumental questions, but it ends by claiming that these questions are the only questions that can be legitimately asked. The awareness that science fosters is ultimately alienating to the extent that it reduces the colorful world we had thought ourselves to be living in to a mechanical world of cold, hard, indifferent facts. For Ford, therefore, understanding hierarchical structure is a prerequisite to "wisdom." Our explications do little more than reduce the higher levels to the lower (p. 202). In the movement from lower to higher there is also a progression from visible and outward to invisible and inward. Play activities done spontaneously for their own sake may ironically be our most useful occupation because they make life something more than an endless response to obligations and servile labor. The new world is not another transcendent world but this world transfigured and seen in a new light. What is transcended is our habitual and stereotypical</page><page sequence="10">304 Book Reviews perception of the world in which we live. Just as doubts rest on a foundation of faith, so meaninglessness rests on a foundation of meaning (p. 255). Ford aims at acquiring a skill for meaning at a new level. Ford's history of meaning attempts to preserve a model of progress while remaining sensitive to pluralist and pragmatic claims. But while we cannot help asking the question of meaning, we may not be able to find common ground in answering it. The notion of complexity on which he bases his model of meaning is psychological, and the ontological conclusions he draws from it resemble those of creationism. Rejecting the scientist claim that metaphysical questions are meaningless, Ford adopts no less controversial Jungian archetypes to make his case. Finding meaning in meaninglessness renders it inconsistent, and if "the higher" is not subject to logic, there can be no consensus regarding it. There is considerably more consensus in scientific predictability and control than there is in philosophical, let alone mythological meaning. Jospeh Grünfeld Drexel University</page></plain_text>
