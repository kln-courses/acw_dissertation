THE word commensense is, I fear, a bete noire of philosophers, partly because it is used and quoted to defy their theories, and partly because it is very difficult to find any clear or precise meaning in its usage. I do not propose here to rely on its original meaning, or trace its history, nor even to attempt an exact definition of it. This, however, it is necessary to state to avoid misunderstandings-that I do not mean by it what may be called horse-sense, nor is it to be confined to sense knowledge, still less to public opinion. The word is chosen as convenient to express and cover certain activities of mind and their content, which can, I think, legitimately be put under one category. By sense is understood what comes by way of experience. Experience, however, is also a vague word, and so I mean by it and sense what can be classed under perception, direct knowledge and judgment; all, in fact, that is opposed to speculation or reflective thought. I should add that in the use of these terms so far, no particular theory is insinuated; they are words of everyday use, and are intended to be taken according to that use. The adjective " common " limits the kind of " knowledge " contained under " sense," and again it is useful as excluding the ephemeral, the conventional, the technical, and the trivial. There is a common stock of knowledge which all men and women 2F</page><page sequence="2">318 M. C. D ARCY use in the ordinary concerns of life gained from the primitive and inevitable experiences which every human being must undergo. This common experience is found in language, and used in literature and conversation, and presupposed and added to in the conduct of art and commerce. Were there no such commonwealth of meanings, language could never have become the easy means of communication that it is, and we should be perpetually in a worse plight than the builders of the Tower of Babel. When we are puzzled, as to-day, by certain modern writers of a new prose or Futuristic art, the cause is a conflict of a new set of meanings created by a theory with the old and established, and the latter will win the day unless the new can rid itself of the esoteric and show itself a legitimate development of what is sound in tradition. Commonsense, therefore, as used in this paper refers to that body of knowledge which is more or less permanent, gained by man in contact with life through experience. If I call it universal I do not mean to imply that I am resting its validity on universal assent. Securus judicat orbis terrarum may be a fair ground of argument, but here it is not to the purpose save in so far as a general agreement about the validity of an experience might imply that the experience in each particular case must have carried with it strong evidence for its truth. The claim then for commonsense is really a claim for truth in much that is direct, as opposed to reflective or philosophic knowledge. Now the question so raised between the claims of common- sense and philosophy is an important one, for if we decide for commonsense then a question mark must be put after much that goes at present as sound in philosophy. Prof. Whitehead has summoned the scientists to answer for the cleavage they have made without misgiving between the world we live in and the world of their abstractions; and his demand that part</page><page sequence="3">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 319 of a true education " should be intuition without an analytical divorce from the total environment," with the addition " that there is no substitute for the direct perception of the concrete achievement of a thing in its actuality," has its bearing on commonsense as I have described it, and its relation to reflective thinking. For may it not be that philosophy has suffered from a similar fault to that of science, in ignoring what is given by direct " knowledge " ? Instead of recognising truth in what is given before reflection, it has by a very human weakness usurped all authority and made itself into a roifaine&amp;ant. How else can we account for the gulf that separates us as human beings and as philosophers, the gulf again between the conceptions that men live by, which are to be found in literature, education, prac- tical ethics and politics, and the theories in the volumes of philo- sophy, and, lastly, the mistrust of the philosopher which is so widespread and perennial ? Philosophers, I know, will have their answers ready, each varying according to his theory, but to judge from the past and the present as well, they will either do scant homage to meta- physics, or they will exalt metaphysics on the plea that experience or the wisdom of commonsense is a very inferior kind of know- ledge to be corrected or sublimated. It might be objected that neither is very satisfactory; if metaphysics is taboo, then a critical examination of the nature of knowledge should not be permitted. Those, for instance, who reduce direct acquaintance with objects to a bare awareness (where the word " bare " implies that the special relation set up by knowing can be ignored) have no right to write a philosophy, because the activity of mind involved in so doing is very different from that bare awareness. Nevertheless, they generally proceed to do so. On the other hand, if what I have called metaphysic is the province par excellence of truth, it is hard to see what an inferior kind of 2 F 2</page><page sequence="4">320 M. C. D ARCY truth can mean. No doubt, the phrase helps to save its makers from the awkward predicament of denying the possibility of attaining truth below the metaphysical, or again, of admitting it unreservedly. Both positions are doomed. If there is no truth before reflection comes in, before a Critical Philosophy has had its say, then on what grounds can reflection or criticism claim to possess truth ? As has been remarked, it is the same mind which works on weekdays as on Sundays, and if the value of the work of the six days cannot be guaranteed as sound, how can the Sabbath reflection be in better plight ? If now we restore the guarantee of truth to the mind in its daily occupations, the reflection on the Sabbath becomes superfluous, and the day truly one of rest. There is an obvious reason, therefore, for searching for some intermediary between the two mental activities, and though I do not assert that this is the sole explanation, the distinc- tion between degrees of truth is very convenient. Moreover, it meets a curious inclination to prefer reflection to direct appre- hension, the complicated to the simple, the demonstrated to the obvious and self-evident. But the inclination, while intelligible, because it safeguards us against hastiness in judgment, has no justification when we judge truly. Once we know a statement to be true, there is an end, and reflection cannot add anything to its truth. The function, therefore, of a Critique must be sought elsewhere, and I think that many might explain the relation of what I have called commonsense, or experience, in the wide sense I have explained, to philosophy proper, by admitting that there may be truth in the first, but certainly not always, and that it is part of the function of reflection to separate the gold from the dross and so form a system of truth. I should have no quarrel with this explanation were its defenders without any concealed or unconscious prejudice against commonsense. In fact, however,</page><page sequence="5">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 321 behind this vague agreement I fancy that there lurks consider- able diversity, or at least a difference of emphasis. Many views are influenced by theories which, though dead, yet exert an influence, bequeathing assumptions, ways of thinking and modes of expression. For instance, even though the word " pheno- menal," as used by Kant, belongs to a theory which is perhaps discarded, the taint of the word subsists, and, consequently, we may pass lightly over experience as not putting us into touch with the thing in itself. Similarly, with sense-data, or the associa- tion of the word commonsense itself with Reid's interpretation of it; an interpretation which, in many places of his writing, connected it with instinct instead of reason. And yet if we forgot theories and arguments for a moment, we should uphold the claims of commonsense, for whether we be writing letters or talking, or thinking, we are using words with a meaning, and we should blush to be told we did not know what we meant. Certainly our everyday life is made up of opinions, beliefs, prejudices, and certainty may be rare, but imbedded in the beliefs are meanings about which we have no doubt. Now meanings attach to objects, and so it would appear that we do have knowledge of objects. So deep is this conviction that the unsophisticated would, if asked, be sure to say that they had a certain knowledge of reality, that language with its distinctions of noun and adjective, its verbs active and passive, and other parts of speech, express the nature of the world we live in. And this conviction finds its place in the tradition of philosophy which descends from Aristotle. In this tradition, the function of mind is to apprehend reality as such; knowledge is of the real, of being or what is. Thought in distinction from sensation is at home with natures or essences-perambulat essentice, and hence, in its ordinary transactions, the intellect is telling us something about what a thing really is. Now this may sound very obvious,</page><page sequence="6">322 M. C. D ARCY but the consequences are so serious, and so often ignored, that it requires restatement. If the intellect is the faculty of truth, and if truth is the apprehension or statement of what a thing or being is, then, as our intellect is never idle, we are constantly in the realm of truth, and the problem of commonsense is not whether it is ever right, but when and where it is wrong. Truth is the normal, and not the accidental, and so the whole emphasis in dealing with the question of commonsense is changed. We should expect then to find far more in the declarations of commonsense than may have been hitherto suspected; for instance, that in understanding what we mean we have already arrived at the goal of truth, or at any rate established what cannot possibly afterwards be pulled down. And here speech and grammar should prove very illuminating. To take some examples :-The distinctions between various attitudes of mind, ranging from surmise through probability to strict knowledge, imply that we know what knowledge is, and that the approxima- tions to it presuppose it, and are also fully intelligible in them- selves. We cannot know without being aware of it, and, if this is so, a reflection on knowledge does not carry us any further in the one essential of its nature or validity, whatever else it may do. Being relieved, therefore, of a philosophy of knowledge in this regard, if we have to call to our aid a Critique of Reason or an Epistemology, we shall have to do so on some other grounds, and, furthermore, since knowledge is its own judge and appraiser, we may find it in operation in many of the dicta of commonsense. Now, in many of the meanings we use in everyday speech, we should, I think, be prepared to swear we knew what we meant until we became confused by the philosophers with their affirma- tions and denials and their theories. No one, for example, hesitates over the meaning of truth till he becomes a philosopher, and the question becomes a difficult one because this theory or</page><page sequence="7">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 323 that has been invented to explain it, and usually fails to do so; because the explanation generally, if not inevitably, consists in the reassertion of a simple notion sui generis, in terms of something else. Here the reflective mind is the villain of the piece, and I think that no one can deny that the history of philosophy is strewn with theories which, by treating a conception or object as what it is not, have made it more difficult for succeeding generations to use any word without ambiguity. (For this reason I might add incidentally that the putting of the question, What do you mean by truth, may be either pertinent or foolish, according as the person asked seems to be assuming a special theory of truth or not.) When we examine commonsense, we find, time and time again, that words have lost their simple and original meaning because theories have twisted them out of recognition, and the old sufficiently defined landmarks become as confused as the battlefields of Flanders. All words that end in " ism " are rightly suspect, and the most common words have to be watched sedulously, because their obvious meaning has been subverted. As the late Professor Cook Wilson wrote, " The fact is that a philosophical distinction is, prima facie, more likely to be wrong than what is called a popular one, because it is based on a philosophical theory which may be wrong in its ultimate principles. This is so far from being appreciated that the reverse opinion is held, and there is a tendency to regard the linguistic distinction as less trustworthy because it is popular, and not due to reflective thought. The truth is the other way. Reflective thought tends to be too abstract, while the experience which has developed the popular distinctions recorded in language is always in contact with the particular facts., Now, it is not uncommon that some usual term, when reflected upon, presents great difficulties to the philosopher, difficulties, it may be said, which are due to some false theory of his which is presupposed.</page><page sequence="8">324 M. C. D ARCY The criticism sometimes ends in pronouncing that reality only means what is intended by some other term, so that in a manner it is explained away; and thus a distinctive use of it is supposed to be a mistake, or even the meaning of the term may be pronounced as altogether an illusion." The same writer gives, in another place, an excellent example of the working of the mind when free from philosophic prejudice, and the intrusion into its language of a technical word, in an analysis of " idea." He argues with considerable force that normal thinking does not lead us into puzzles about intermediaries in knowledge between the object and the mind; there is no confusion between the content of our knowledge and phantasm or images; there is no sharp distinction between appearance and reality. But the word " idea " comes like a wolf into the fold, being historicallv connected with a theory which commonsense knows nothing about-and so the evil starts. The same pernicious interference, it may be urged, can be seen in many other examples, and the result would be to give us greater confidence in our unsophisticated conceptions. Here, however, to prevent exaggeration, a distinction is required. I have said that the average man is under the impression that he knows what he is talking about, that his language is of reality, and that its distinctions are founded on that reality. In certain cases he would have no hesitation in saying that he understood fully, in others that he understood correctly and summarily but not adequately. This distinction is important because it gives full play to the claims of commonsense and yet leaves room for a philosophy. Knowledge itself is the best example of the first category. A man in knowing must understand completely what he is doing; otherwise never will he gain a foothold. Besides, all the other attitudes of mind have significance only if knowledge is already understood; and this implies that the word " thinking" is fully evident. The same, I suggest, may be said of equality</page><page sequence="9">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 325 and inequality, of relation, existence, presence, and so forth. I hesitate to give other examples for fear of being provocative, and so preventing a possible agreement in principle by conflict about detail. For the purpose in view, conceptions which might belong to the first category, can be assigned to the second. The conceptions which belonged to the latter were described as understood correctly and summarily but not adequately. This description will appear less vague if we recall what was said of the mind-that it was the activity whose sphere was reality as it is. In the first contact with reality by experience, whether in perception, observation or judgment, we apprehend being, substantive, adjectival or relatival, and I would suggest that this direct apprehension is of more importance than is usually recog- nized-for, so to speak, it secures a grip on the real. It is of its -very nature more likely to be correct, though inadequate, than incorrect; that is, as I have said, success is the normal, and lailure the abnormal, which needs explanation. Our first appre- hensions are of a general character, they catch hold of an object wholly before proceeding to consider aspects of it; that is, as I have said, they know it as a form of being. Unfortunately, the subsequent proceedings Qf the scientists, who quite justifiably -abstract from the object in the plenitude of its being to examine it, for example, in so far as it is measurable-tend to make the philosopher forget the Humpty Dumpty on the wall in his interest in the pieces. And so he attempts a restoration out of a selected piece; and if over-confident, calls his new monstrosity the real Humpty Dumpty, or, in despair, declares that there never was such a being. Here the philosopher has surrendered com- pletely to the scientist, and has forgotten that he is far more akin to the commonsense man in that both deal with reality integrally-the one with its most striking characteristic, the ~other with the complete characterization and essence.</page><page sequence="10">326 M. C. D ARCY Perhaps the worst example ready to hand of this failure to appreciate the " given " and the consequent sham reconstruction out of the pieces of abstraction is Behaviourism. As a working hypothesis it may be legitimate to treat the whole, which is conscious life, under the aspect of behaviour. For this purpose there will be no need for " reference to such terms as sensation, perception, attention, will, image, and the like." But when this scientific procedure is exalted into a philosophy and thinking is defined as "subvocal talking" and nothing else, and all the activities of consciousness are resolved into the reaction of the body to stimuli, then the vice which I have denounced is apparent, and the indelible meaning of consciousness and its activities given in commonsense and reflective thinking has been simply disregarded. The extreme position of Behaviourism is instructive, because it provides such an obvious example of the bad habits of philosophers which might not be so apparent in other theories. But I suggest that the same error is present in a more disguised form in many of the theories prevalent at the present day. Instead of psychologists admitting the data of developed con- sciousness as present from the beginning in embryo, the totumn sed non totaliter, we find them tracing their genesis out of some- thing quite indeterminate-or, at any rate, radically different from the resultant known. Time and space are evolved out of what was not originally given; and the object or thing with its, appearances is reconstructed out of the pieces of sense-data. This reconstruction breaks down continually, but philosophers will not learn the lesson clear to commonsense from the start- that the real world is not a combination of sense-data, but a colleetion or constitution of subjects with attributes. This neglect of the subject has been rectified to some extent with regard to the self or soul because of the scandal increasingly felt in leaving it out. Yet the history of its restoration provides</page><page sequence="11">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 327 an excellent confirmation of the thesis in this paper. We see first a neglect of the information contributed by commonsense, and in the interest of a theory the self is reduced to a succession of impressions bound together somehow by association. This view, pre-valent for some time, so failed to answer what was meant by self and to meet the facts, that a stream of consciousness was introduced as an amendment. But the stream was again found insufficient because the self was left out and the unity persisting, despite periods of unconsciousness had not been explained. Hence, a more modern tendency to revive " animism " and reinsert an entelechy, though the movement has not yet turned full circle. Scarcely less illuminating are the vicissitudes in the explanation of memory. One might have supposed that the meaning of memory would be clear, and the unsophisticated would be surprised to be told that he did not understand what he was continually exercising and speaking about; but he would be still more surprised to find explanations which, if true, would entail that the past is revived as present, seeing that the essential characteristic of memory is a thinking of an event as past. What comes out in these examples is that common sense is justified in clinging to its conceptions. The philosophic theory has in each case neglected its findings and suffered a reverse. These conceptions are, as I have suggested, of the real; they tell us what a being is correctly if inadequately. Further illustra- tions would, I think, confirm this result, and I may suggest a few without entering into a detailed examination of them. The habit, for instance, of translating the objects of perception, such as colour into vibrations, and leaving out colour or, what is perhaps even worse, talking about the brain being coloured, contravenes the meaning both of perception and colour, for try as one will one can never see vibrations, and there is something which is seen. Let, again, a theory dispose of causation, discard</page><page sequence="12">328 M. C. D ARCY consciousness and a subject as not required, and after reducing reality to a changeless world where we are left with just a probabi- lity that events of a certain kind may follow events of another kind, substitute mnemonic causation, perspective and belief- feeling; on the principles suggested in this paper the criticism would be the same; reality has already been rightly apprehended and the theory is an evisceration. Causality has a meaning which cannot be reduced to something else, and probability involves knowledge, while the attempt to reconstruct reality without a consciousness or a subject lands one in the Humpty Dumpty predicament. Extending still further this kind of knowledge, which is correct if inadequate, may we not apply it even to such distinctions as matter and mind, inanimate and animate, and with more assurance to the provinces of ethics and sesthetics. These latter serve perhaps best of all to bring out the nature of our conceptions, the conceptions of commonsense, as I have called them. All of us act as if we had a fair if inadequate idea of what is good and what is evil. We might be mistaken in certain particular cases, but even then we should correct our mistake in the light of what we knew, so that somehow the meaning of good appears already in our possession. Similarly, with the virtues and the vices. Plato, as we know, opens his Republic dramatically with the figure of the old man Cephalus, who, though incapable of a philosophic justification of his actions, practises justice; and the suggestion given is that a theory of justice must be in accord with the " common sense " of the old man. As a matter of fact, in the Republic, as in all sound treatises on the virtues, the theory is not only in accord with this commonsense, but is tested by it. Our theory of justice or bravery or love is confirmed or upset by its ability to meet what we are certain is justice or bravery or love in individual cases; so that in a sense we must be already</page><page sequence="13">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 329 aware of what these virtues are. Now, if this be so, we have an excellent example of the truth of the assertion that normally we know reality at once; roughly, perhaps, as a rude sketch, but so accurately that the details or the articulation must be in accord with the first vision. A further confirmation of this would come from an analysis of the actual process whereby we pass from uncertainty to certainty. It is a curious fact that this process usually takes the form of asking ourselves what exactly we mean or must mean when we are thinking. We think we have arrived at the truth, and then find that it is not exactly what we had in mind; we proceed, as I said, by measuring the theory against what we, somehow, know already but cannot express adequately. As a contemporary philosopher has put it: " In growth of thought man broods and picks out what he seeks; the consciousness of the general nature of what he seeks somehow controls the movement of thought wherein detail suggests itself." And again: " In the growth of mind we cannot refuse to admit that what comes to be is what was imperfectly before. And as 'the passionate thought ' directs the mind in study or the vague, though passionate thought of the complete work of art directs it, in designing, so it seems as if the mind helped to direct the process by which it is developed."' We can now sum up all that has been said so far. Common- sense in the sense used in this paper of that wealth of information belonging to man as man deserves far greater respect than it usually receives at the hands of philosophers. Being the outcome of experience and tradition, it is often a safeguard against the reconstruction of the universe in a philosophic theory. But, further, it has at times just as much claim to truth as any state- ment of metaphysic, because the word " sense " here does not exclude the activity of the mind, and, in fact, the mind is</page><page sequence="14">330 M. C. D ARCY intimately involved, being engaged on its proper work of seeking and finding the nature of what is. As, however, it is unreflective, we can distinguish three classes of objects with which it is concerned. The first are those which yield their meaning completely; and here we have knowledge strictly so-called. In the second class the general nature of objects with their differences from others is seized, but there is given only a sketch or summary, the details of which have to be filled in later. And into the third class falls the vast number of objects whose nature is at first more or less indeterminate, so that men have to wait on time, experiment and reflection before they can come to any certain conclusion. It remains now to consider what change this view of common- sense demands in the outlook of philosophers. First, as suggested in the beginning, in certain camps a change of front is required, and, in general, a high regard for the convictions of commonsense must be preserved. This regard will show itself in a deeper appreciation of language and the distinctions in it. These distinc- tions arising through the pressure of reality in experience, save the philosopher from his besetting sin of reducing the irreducible in his desire to systematize and form a unified conception of reality. Secondly, since it is normal for commonsense to be right, it were better when it is wrong to examine the reasons of the error than to treat its data in a cavalier fashion with occasional returns to courtesy. A great benefit would be conferred on the philosophic community if definite canons could be drawn up directing us to the chief sources of error, such as the contamina- tion of judgment by prejudice, the tendency to treat the negative as something positive, and the immaterial as possessed of sensible properties. This latter is, perhaps, the most prolific of error, as we cannot help imaging and imagining the immaterial, in sensible</page><page sequence="15">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 331 form, and anthropomorphism is for ever getting in the way of a proper conception of the ideal and the divine. It must be confessed, however, that one almost equally fruitful source is the damnosa hwereditas of bad philosophy. The evil that it does lives after, passing into common language and common thought, and so confusing simple conceptions that even the wise begin to wonder whether they know what, for example, duty or knowledge ,or reality mean. Thirdly, a vindication of commonsense does not lessen the value of philosophy. In this paper I have reserved the name philosophy for the more reflective operations of the mind, for the theories which are built upon the data of the less reflective consciousness, and for the explanation of them per ultimas ,causas. It might be urged against this distinction that throughout this paper I have been playing the philosopher, inasmuch as the justification made out rested on reflection. To save ambiguity, perhaps the word analysis might be used in contradistinction to synthesis. Of course, an analysis has to be made both of what we mean and of the truth contained in what we mean, but this, if part of a philosophy, is separate from the other member, which would involve the construction of a system. But the more serious objection is that the glory of philosophy, namely, system-making, is taken away from it, and in its place we are to have nothing but a checking and docketing of the data of commonsense; and even this occupation has been converted into a mere formality by the cry beforehand that all is well. To this the answer is that philosophy suffers not a whit, that there is nothing obscurantist in the plea for a fair trial for the convictions and judgments which we hold so firmly when we forget our philosophy, and that there is no pre-judging of the case before it comes into court. It would be quite a mistake to think that a favourable attitude to the suit of commonsense means less and</page><page sequence="16">332 M. C. D ARCY not more thought. The analysis of what we mean persistently practised is a heavy if salutary labour of thought, and the close attention to the infinite shades of meaning in the world of our consciousness, as well as in the infinitely rich variety of the external world, spells gain to us and not loss. There is, too, no formula or prescription which will save us the labour of continually examining the content of our thought. This labour may not be congenial to the lover of synthesis ever bent on discovering or inventing a new philosophy. There will always be, I suppose, some discord between two types of philosophers, between those who are content to dig and examine foundations and those who build castles-often in the air. The analyst is sceptical of these synthetic philosophies; while his opponent is impatient of this stay-at-home policy, being eager himself to reach an Eldorado. There is no reason in the nature of things why both should not work together, and the difference is one of taste and not of reason, and taste should not enter in when it is a question of truth. Truth should be the sole dictator, and it is wrong to sneer at, commonsense because its light is very dry and its findings. apparently trivial. As a matter of fact, the truth in commonsense is by no means trivial or sober, for as Plato and Augustine saw, the truth is always there present to us, ancient and ever fresh, and it is " our estranged faces that miss the many-splendoured thing." After all, there is nothing undignified in vindicating one's hearth and home-territory instead of wandering to join far-off causes; nor, again, in maintaining a common humanity and common fund of truth with the men and women who appear in the literatures of Greece and Rome and the Middle Ages. To prevent misunderstanding, it may be well to add another paragraph in conclusion. Fight as they may with one another there is no serious reason why the defender of commonsense, the analyst and the synthetic philosopher should not work together</page><page sequence="17">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 333 amicably-in fact, it is necessary that they should do so if a theory is to deserve the name philosophic. There is, I believe, room for a critique of knowledge, even though the meaning and validity of knowledge be understood fully in the very act of knowing. But, apart from this vexed question there is certainly room for a metaphysic, no matter what value we assign to the judgments of commonsense, and even to a philosophy which approximates to the mystic in its delicacy of apprehension and anticipation of the possibilities of intuition. If the number of fixed stars in the firmament of commonsense be greater than was supposed, that only means that the system co-ordinating them will be closer to truth and more vast in its embrace. The philosopher is still at liberty to search for the inter-relation of the data, their causes and grounds, seeking to penetrate to the ultimate causes and see all dialectically or synoptically. How one should set about this unity, on what principles and with what results, it is outside thbe scope of this paper to inquire. But, clearly, the closer the inter- relation of the data, the less artificial it is, the more it allows for the rich variety of reality, the nearer will it be to full compre- hension. Perhaps the ideal is impossible of complete attainment because the universe transcends man's limited capacities; and, just as a critic of a supreme artist grasps but partially the signifi- cance of his work, and returns again and again to find new detail and new meanings, so, too, the theories of philosophy are incapable of rivalling the divine plan. This does not mean that they must necessarily be false, but it does suggest that the limitation must enter in in our account of the whole of reality. Herein, as it seems to me, lies the strength of the Aristotelian tradition. In that philosophy there is an explanation of why the human mind is pursued by failure, and yet rightly confident in its ability to know to some extent truly what the nature of reality is; why, again, the concrete individual 2 ,.</page><page sequence="18">334 M. C. D ARCY escapes the mesh of abstractions and yet can be appreciated to a degree by means of those abstractions, with the result that the philosophy is both faithful to commonsense, and yet, if anything, ultra-metaphysical. The whole philosophy is governed by certain principles which are not taken from any section of reality, but are components of anything which deserves the name real at all. They therefore leave each intrinsic nature intact, and allow for it, and yet provide a means of unifying our conceptions of these natures in one system. In the place then, of a unity which, by identifying the whole with one member in it must necessarily impoverish the real, we have a hierarchy of being where the prin- ciples of order, being as wide as reality itself, leave the intrinsic denominations of that reality unaffected. Moreover, in that hierarchy, the human being finds his proper place, not at the top, nor at the bottom; neither pure spirit nor pure matter, but a half-way house between the two; a mind which can grow only by its contact with matter, and a matter which is a fit instrument for the mind. I choose this example of a metaphysic, not for the purpose of defending it in this paper, but in order to give an illustration of how commonsense and a metaphysic may go hand in hand, and how a system may fail to exhaust reality and yet remain true, giving us a synthetic vision, and at the same time a philo- sophy of failure. This value, I claim, attaches to the system, even if the system itself fails to recommend itself to modern minds. But whatever system be adopted, it must certainly be fully alive to the differences which make up the complex world we know, and avoid those generalizations which conceal more than they reveal, keeping, so to say, in the sun and away from the night, in which all cows are black. When philosophers, for instance, explain laughter to us by telling us that we laugh at the incongruous, they forget that they have told us little or</page><page sequence="19">THE CLAIMS OF COMMONSENSE 335 niothing, for we do not laugh at all that is incongruous, but only at comic incongruities. When duty is called a moral necessity or a law, the chief characteristic of duty is in danger of being left out, for it is like no other form of law, and only necessary inasmuch as it is a peculiar form of obligation. When Croce attributes freedom to every motion from that of a stone or a flower to the choices of man, the word freedom is made to cover what are radically incompatible, so that it becomes for the most part a mere metaphor; and his definition of volition, as at once necessary and free-necessary as arising from an historical situation, and free as going beyond it-is so vague as to apply to every event in nature, while it tells us nothing of the difference between the falling of a stone and the choice of a man. This subsuming of one department of reality under another is but a verbal operation; the old distinctions stick out all the while, and no one is any the wiser for it. Nature and life have taught us lessons that we cannot ignore, and the more we contemplate nature and others and ourselves without prejudice, the less shall we be prone to bring out any foot-rule of theory. Are not, for example, many of the problems connected with the self, or God, due to the prejudices and preconceptions with which we approach them! The self, if it be anything, will clearly have marked characteristics of its own separating it from all else, and it may be just its nature to be permanent and identical in and through development; a conception which, if unique, is nevertheless not self-contradictory. The same cannot be said of Gentili's conception of God as pure act and also in an eternal process of self-realisation, eternal and also successive. Where a subject is not already a pure act, we can see, I think, meaning in a combina- tion of change and permanence, but when all imperfection and potency are removed, how can there coexist plenitude and growth ?

Indeed, when treating of God, philosophers are especially apt to forget what divinity inmplies. The conception is there rooted in tradition and language, and I suggest that if we would but admit with commonsense that we have some dim awareness of what divinity must and must not mean, many of the prevalent theories of God's nature would have to be rewritten. These examples, then, out of many other possible ones, help to show that commonsense is not a foe of philosophy, but an ally; they show too that one of its chief services is to point the way to a true metaphysic and to warn philosophy of its principal vice. The vice written in almost every page of its history, of neglecting the multiplicity often given and of attempting to rule by a veritable massacre of innocents. By these means we win a unity at too dear a price. Solitudinemfaciunt et pacem appellant.</page></plain_text>
