Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT Spine kinematics information can have important implications for biomechanical model development, anthropomorphic test device development, injury prevention, surgical treatment and safety equipment design. There is a paucity of data of this type available for children. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of age and gender on the three- dimensional kinematics of the pediatric cervical spine. Sixty subjects from the pediatric population were recruited and divided into groups based on gender and age (young group age 4-10 years and older group age 11-17 years). Subjects actively moved their head in axial rotation, lateral bending and flexion-extension. An optoelectronic motion analysis system recorded the position of infrared markers placed on the first thoracic vertebrae (T1) and on tight-fitting headgear worn by subjects. Helical axis of motion (HAM) parameters were calculated for the head with respect to T1. Young females had a more lateral HAM location in lateral bending and a more anterior HAM location in flexion- extension and axial rotation compared to the older children. The HAM orientation of young females in lateral bending was tilted to the right, whereas the older children were tilted to the left. The variation in spine mechanics of young females found in the present study may indicate general trends that would grow stronger in even younger children. INTRODUCTION Cervical spine motion in adults has been studied extensively.2 5"7131419 However, very little data exists on the normal cervical spine motion in the pediatric population. In children, spinal injuries most often occur in the cervical region (80%).9 In comparison to all other pediatric injuries, cervical spine injuries result in the most severe trauma, highest mortality (15%), and longest hospital stays.1 With 1455 new pediatric spinal cord injuries per year in the United States, 56% arising from motor vehicle accidents,21 information that could result in improved motor vehicle safety equipment design for children is of great interest. Numerous studies have noted a significant difference in the level of cervical spine injury with age, specifically observing the increased prevalence of upper cervical spine injuries among children under the age of 1 1 3;8;12;15;18 |y|any have hypothesized the factors contributing to this clinical finding based on a suspected age-related difference in spine mechanics.4 Contributing factors thought to affect spine mechanics in the pediatric population include: incomplete spine ossification, ligament laxity, altered pediatric facet joint orientation, weak paraspinal musculature and relative head size.4 8 Unossified vertebrae may affect the mechanical performance and kinematics of the spine. 4 817 Selected ossification occurrences include the posterior fusion of the neural arches of C3-C7 by 2-3 years of age, the fusion of the neural arches and vertebral body at 3-6 years of age and the fusion of the transverse process with the neural arch by 6 years of age.8 Longitudinal growth of the posterior elements of the spine is complete at approximately 10 years of age whereas longitudinal growth of the anterior elements of the spine, including the vertebral body, continues until the age of 16-18 years.17 The ossification of the cervical spine is not complete until 25 years of age when the inferior epiphyseal ring fuses to the vertebral body.4817 863</page><page sequence="2">Many researchers have sought to determine factors influencing adult cervical spine mechanics. In 1992, Dvorak et al conducted a study to determine the effect of age and gender on the range of motion of the cervical spine6. The results of the study showed that the range of motion of the cervical spine decreased as age increased, and varied with gender. In 1997, Lee et al investigated the center of rotation (COR) of the cervical spine and found that in patients suffering from injuries to the neck, the horizontal component of the COR was shifted anteriorly while flexing the spine from 5° to 25° and at 5° of extension compared to the healthy subject group.13 With varying COR among patients and healthy individuals, Lee concluded that the COR may be used as a measure of cervical spine stability. The helical axis of motion (HAM) is a three-dimensional analogue to the two-dimensional COR. The HAM is defined as the unique axis about which an object rotates and simultaneously translates along to move from one position in space to another. The HAM location is closely linked to the COR as the HAM location is where the HAM penetrates the sagittal plane, coronal plane and axial plane in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation respectively. For a planar motion, the HAM penetration point is equivalent to the COR. Woltring et al. 22 examined the HAM of a 30 year old whiplash patient before and after treatment and compared this result to the HAM of a healthy individual. The results demonstrated the whiplash patient had increasing vertical fluctuations of the HAM location that deviated farther from the first thoracic vertebrae (T1) than the fluctuations in position for the healthy individual. While this study had only two subjects, these results suggest that patient injury may lead to neck weakness and consequently an altered HAM. Since children have far weaker musculature in the neck than an adult, while carrying their approximate adult head size, these previous studies support the hypothesis that healthy young children will have altered cervical spine mechanics compared to older children and adults. The kinematics of the pediatric cervical spine, in terms of HAM, has not been previously reported to our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of age and gender on the three-dimensional kinematics of the pediatric cervical spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty subjects were recruited and divided into 4 groups: Young girls (mean age 7.4 ± 2 yrs, n=15), young boys (mean age 8.6 ±1.2 yrs, n=15), older girls (mean age 13 ±1.6 yrs, n=15) and older boys (mean age 13 ± 1.8 yrs, n=15). All subjects had normal vestibular, head and neck function with no spinal or growth abnormalities and no previous injuries to the neck. Subjects were either healthy volunteers or patients with appendicular bone fractures attending the Orthopaedic Clinic at British Columbia Children and Women's Hospital. Institutional Review Board ethics approval was obtained. Subjects were seated with their trunk supported and were asked to perform active flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation of the head in time with an audible metronome at a frequency of 0.4 Hz. Subject head movement frequency was guided with use of a visual aid (plush toy moved in front of the head of the subject). Subjects were positioned approximately 2 m from an optoelectronic motion analysis system (Optotrak Certus, Northern Digital, Waterloo, Ontario). Subjects were instructed to keep an upright posture to the best of their ability. Two sets of 3 repetitions each were performed and recorded for each of three motions: lateral bending, flexion-extension and axial rotation. The maximum range of motion of these movements was guided with the visual aid, but generally self-determined. Post- processing between a fixed range of angles corrected for the variability in range of motion among volunteers. DATA COLLECTION Head and T1 kinematics were recorded with the Optotrak at a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The sensor tracked the three-dimensional (3D) position of eight active infrared (IR) markers attached to a tight fitting lightweight headpiece worn by subjects. Four IR markers attached to a flexible membrane were taped securely to the skin over the spinous process of T1. Four IR markers were also placed on a box behind the chair on which the subject was seated to define the laboratory coordinate system. The initial position data of these markers were used to form rigid body models of the head, T1 and chair. Subject measurements included height, weight, seated height and neck circumference. The 3D coordinates of the spinous process of T1, right and left medial heads of the clavicle and the acromion were determined using the Optotrak digitizing probe. COORDINATE SYSTEM A T1 -fixed coordinate frame was used where the origin was placed on top of the skin over the spinous process of T1, a location determined based on the geometry of the flexible membrane placed over T1 . A right-handed space-fixed coordinate frame was defined for all three head movements with the x-axis positive to the subject's right, the y-axis positive upward vertical and the z- axis positive in the posterior direction (Figure 1 ). Static data was acquired with the subject seated and assuming an upright posture while looking straight ahead, this was defined as the reference position. Rotation of the head (modeled as a rigid body) in space was calculated as Euler angles. DATA PROCESSING The kinematic behavior of the spine was examined with the motion of the head relative to T1 using an in-house computer program. Specifically, the HAM location and orientation were calculated using the procedure outlined by Kinzel et al.11 The HAM location was reported as a penetration point in one plane (i.e. sagittal (yz) for 864</page><page sequence="3">flexion-extension) and its orientation was presented as a projection in the other two planes (i.e. the coronal (xy) and transverse (xz) planes for flexion-extension). Based on the coordinate system outlined above, the HAM location was in the x-y plane for lateral bending, in the Figure 1. Coordinate system at T1 x-z plane for axial rotation and the y-z plane for flexion- extension. In flexion-extension, HAM data was analyzed to describe the motion between 20° flexion to 20° extension. In axial rotation, HAM data was analyzed from 40° rotation to the right to 40° rotation to the left. In lateral bending, HAM data was analyzed from 20° bending to the right to 20° bending to the left. As each motion of a subject had six trials (two sets with three repetitions each) producing six HAM data sets, the specific trial resulting in the smallest out of plane motion, (represented as the translation along the HAM, k) was chosen as the best representative "pure rotation" trial and the HAM location, HAM orientation and k value were extracted from it. The HAM location data was normalized based on the skeletal geometry of the subject. The x-location of the HAM was normalized with the digital output of the horizontal distance from T1 to the acromion (0% located at T1). The y-location of the HAM was normalized based on the measured seated height of the subject (0% located at top of head). The z-location of the HAM was normalized based on the digital output of the distance from T1 to the average z-location of the right and left medial head of the clavicle (0% located at T1). Reported HAM orientation angles are relative to the positively directed corresponding axis. For example, HAMx is the angle of the helical axis with respect to the positive x-axis. REPEATABILITY Four healthy subjects aged 7, 9, 30 and 40 years were measured using the same procedures outlined above for three tests conducted on separate occasions. The corresponding HAM parameters were analyzed for differences among tests. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The effect of age and gender on the HAM parameters were determined using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc analysis was used to determine the differences between specific groups. For the repeatability study, the effect of test number on the HAM parameters was determined using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). For all statistical analyses STATISTICA 5.1 H (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used and a 95% level of significance was assumed. RESULTS The HAM location in axial rotation was located anterior to T1 , 72 - 86% of the distance to the medial head of the clavicle (Figure 2k). Laterally, the HAM location was located between T1 (0%) and 2.9% of the lateral distance to the acromion (Figure 2k). The HAM in axial rotation was oriented approximately as the gravitational vertical (Figure 2B,C). Young females demonstrated a significantly more anterior HAM location in axial rotation compared to older males (p=0.022). No other kinematic parameters in axial rotation exhibited significant differences due to age or gender. The HAM location in lateral bending was approximately 5.0 - 7.7% superior to T1 and approximately 5.0% laterally to T1 (Figure 3A). The HAM in lateral bending was oriented approximately in the anterior-posterior direction, however it was tilted slightly upwards (Figure 3B,C). Young females demonstrated a significantly more rightward oriented HAM in lateral bending compared to older males (p=0.021) and older females (p=0.019). Young females also demonstrated a significantly more rightward x-location of HAM in lateral bending compared to older males (p=0.015), older females (p=0.003) and young males (p=0.037). No other kinematic parameters in lateral bending exhibited significant differences due to age or gender. The HAM location in flexion-extension was located 5.2 - 7.2% superior to T1 and approximately 78 - 96 % anterior to T1 (Figure 4A). The HAM orientation in flexion-extension was approximately horizontal (right- left) (Figure 4B,C). Young females demonstrated a significantly more anterior HAM location in flexion- extension compared to older males (p=0.01 3). No other kinematic parameters in flexion-extension exhibited significant differences due to age or gender. REPEATABILITY Four subjects were tested to evaluate protocol repeatability and tested on three separate occasions. For each subject, the results of all three tests were grouped together and presented as a mean ± standard deviation where the standard deviation values provide a measure of variation in each subject across the three occasions (Table 2). No significant differences were found between test number (p&gt;0.05). 865</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Kinematic results in axial rotation. A. Axial view of the HAM location. B.

The HAM parameters of the skull relative to T1 were calculated for all motions and compared among groups. Some differences were found in the young female group and this may have implications for biomechanical model and anthropomorphic test device development, injury prevention, surgical treatment and safety equipment design. Lee et al. 13 investigated the COR of the cervical spine and found that in patients suffering from injuries to the neck, the horizontal component of the COR was shifted anteriorly while flexing the spine. Interestingly, the present study observed a more anterior HAM location (COR) in flexion-extension and axial rotation in the young female group compared to the older age group: Further, the HAM of young females was found to be 867</page><page sequence="6">angled further to the right in lateral bending as compared to older males and females. As the study was non-invasive, an inherent limitation was the incorporation of skin motion with the infrared markers. However, assuming skin motion to be fairly consistent among all volunteers, the relative differences in the HAM among age groups and gender is assumed to remain valid. The study was also limited due to the unrestrained posture of subjects during head movements. Volunteers were instructed to maintain an upright posture, however subjects were free to move in all directions. As a T1 -fixed coordinate system was used, thoracic movement is accounted for in data processing. However, the effect of variability in posture among subjects on cervical spine mechanics is unknown. Another limitation noted is the 1 .2 year higher mean age of the young male group compared to the young female group. This difference in age may have contributed to the finding of no significant differences in age and gender found in the young male group. The present study determined the HAM of flexion- extension and lateral bending over a 40° range of motion and axial rotation over an 80° degree range of motion as these were the maximum amplitudes seen for most volunteers. On occasion, some subjects did not reach this range of motion and therefore the data was analyzed according to the maximum range of motion met by the specific subject. Upon analysis, it was noted that a small deviation (&lt;1 0°) from the chosen range of motion for analysis did not greatly affect the HAM location. The occurrence where a subject did not meet the range of motion for analysis was infrequent, however this is also a limitation of the study. Repeatability results presented in Table 2 display the kinematic parameters as a mean ± standard deviation between the three tests for each of the four subjects. The present study analyzed active head movements and therefore a relatively large standard deviation occurred compared to a passive study and this was expected6 due to the number of muscles and complexity of the muscular system in controlling the head. Despite this larger standard deviation, the choice of using active motion in the study is a strength as the results are more representative of everyday motion. None of the twelve HAM parameters statistically analyzed showed a significant difference with test number across all repeatability subjects. Lee et al measured the COR of the head relative to the thorax in older healthy subjects (mean age 66 ± 8 yrs).13 Various angles of flexion and extension were analyzed, the most applicable to the present study being the analysis of the COR for angles from 0° to 25° flexion and 0° to 25° extension. As the present study analyzed angles of 20° flexion to 20° extension, the present HAM data in flexion-extension was re-calculated for 0° to 20° flexion and 0° to 20° extension for comparison with the previous study (Table 3). Further, the differences in coordinate systems among the two studies were adjusted; however, Lee did not present normalized data, therefore differences in subject skeletal frame dimensions are not taken into account.

This finding could explain the increased prevalence of higher cervical spine injuries in younger children.3;8;12:15:18 The standard deviation of the present study remains large, representing the inherent variation among subjects, however the values are less than or equivalent to those reported by Lee et al.13 The lower standard deviations in the present study may be due to the smaller age range selected, or differences in test methodology such as the procedure in locating the origin or the equipment used (Optotrak vs. CA-6000).13 It is imperative that anthropomorphic test devices respond to loading with biofidelic head and neck kinematics to accurately quantify the protection offered by vehicle restraint systems and other safety equipment. These dummies are designed to meet response requirements for neck flexion, extension and lateral bending. For dummies representing the adult population, neck responses are based on human volunteer and cadaver tests 16, while for dummies representing the pediatric population, they were determined by applying scaling techniques to the adult requirements.101 These scaling techniques incorporate variations in size, mass, and elastic moduli of bone;10 however, other developmental parameters such as stage of ossification, strength of the paraspinal musculature, and ligament laxity3 have not been quantitatively addressed in detail. The limitations of scaling techniques combined with the paucity of pediatric biomechanical data of neck flexion, extension, and lateral bending result in a need for such data to assist in the development of pediatric anthropomorphic test devices. The present finding of altered cervical spine kinematics in the young versus older population of children may provide an explanation for the increased prevalence of upper cervical spine injuries in young children compared to adults.38121518 The most specific difference was a higher HAM location in flexion-extension in the study population. Although this specific difference between the young (~8 years old) and older (-13 years old) children was not found, the average HAM locations under flexion and extension were considerably higher for both of the child groups compared to the most similar parameter, the COR reported for adults13 (Table 3). This information suggests that it may be fruitful and important to further elucidate the nature and causes of these kinematic differences. Future studies of this type as well as the results we report here may be used to improve injury prevention devices such as child restraints and helmets. The quantitative results of this study may also be directly used in the development and improvement of mathematical models of the pediatric cervical spine and pediatric anthropomorphic test devices. CONCLUSIONS Reference values of the helical axis of motion (HAM) of the pediatric cervical spine in flexion-extension, axial rotation and lateral bending were determined for the first time. The optoelectronic motion analysis system provided accurate and repeatable data in this application. The HAM orientation in axial rotation and flexion-extension was observed to be anterior in young females compared to the older subjects. Young females also showed a more rightward location of the HAM in lateral bending, with a HAM oriented further to the right compared to the older subjects. The results of the HAM in the young age group support the hypothesis that the pediatric spine has altered mechanics. Also, a comparison of our results with published data for adults shows that children have a considerably higher HAM location than adults in flexion-extension. This higher HAM may partially explain the relatively high incidence of upper cervical spine injuries in young children. This may indicate general trends that would grow stronger in even younger children. Future work in this area is warranted and this may further elucidate the exact mechanisms responsible for the relatively high incidence of upper cervical spine injuries in young children.
