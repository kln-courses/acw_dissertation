<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LATE CYCLADIC IJUGLET FROM THERASIA IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM (BM 1926.4-10.9)1 IN 1926 A SMALL JUG from Therasia came into the possession of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities of the British Museum, London. It was presented by Mrs James Theodore Bent and most probably she and her husband acquired it during their travels in the Cyclades in 1883 and 1884.2 The vase was found on the small islet of Therasia, west of Thera, during French excavations of the farmstead there, in 1866.3 BM Ig926.4-IO.9 (FIG. I a-c). H. 12.5 cm, D. 6.5 cm (at the belly). Repaired; top of spout broken and otherwise slightly chipped. Low belly, spout pinched together to form long narrow channel, ring base, cylindrical handle. Slipped to base; upper flat part of beak, base of handle, lower body and base decorated with bands; originally handle seems to have been painted; simple necklace circumscribes the neck; the spout is embellished on either side, close (b) 0 1 2 3 4 5cm i ......

R. Williams, Keeper of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities of the British Museum, London, who very generously gave me permission to examine and publish the vase. I also wish to thank J. Lesley Fitton and D. Bailey (British Museum, London) for their invaluable assistance. I would especially like to thank my supervisor, Prof. J. N. Coldstream, for drawing my attention to this vase, and for his constant help and encouragement. I cannot give adequate thanks to Prof. C. Doumas for his generous and willing help with this paper. For the chronology of the EBA in the Cyclades I have followed Barber and MacGillivray's terminology: see R. L. N. Barber and J. A. MacGillivray, 'The Early Cycladic period: matters of definition and terminology', AJA 84 (1980), 141-57; R. L. N. Barber, The Cyclades in the Bronze Age (London, 1987), 24.

ECONOMIDOU to handle, with a circle, open on its upper side and a dot in its centre, resembling an eye. Motifs in matt dark brown paint. Semi-coarse fabric; buff-coloured whitish clay, containing pumice; lack of mica.4 TYPOLOGY The vase form is a descendant of the 'geometric' ware beaked jug of the EC III B period5 and is similar to the Middle Cycladic form.6 This type of beaked jug is a favourite in the Cycladic White ware of MC date. The decoration consists of curvilineai abstract or floral motifs. On some jugs an anthropomorphic appearance is achieved by painted 'eyes' on either side of the beak.7 On Thera, Cycladic White ware pottery has been found in a dug-out structure at Ftellos,8 a tomb at Karageorghis quarry9 and the settlement at Akrotiri.'o This pottery group was succeeded on Thera by the Cycladic Dark-on-Light ware of the LC I period." One of the characteristic vases of this category is the nippled ewer.12 A series of such vases'3 was found in the Volcanic Destruction Level at Akrotiri,14 dated to the mature LC I period.'" DATE The form of BM 1926.4-1o.9, its motifs and system of decoration, the matt, dark brown paint, as well as its local fabric, classify it among the pottery of the Cycladic Dark-on-Light ware, such as is attested in the Seismic Destruction Level at Akrotiri.'6 The form of the vase stands closer to the Middle Cycladic form. The absolute absence of nipples suggests an early date for the jug from Therasia. Moreover, the necklace and the 'eye' decoration are not so elaborate as in the later vases from the Volcanic Destruction Level. On these examples the necklace is double and the nipples are well-formed. Thus the small jug from Therasia may be considered intermediate between the beaked jugs of the MC period and the breasted or nippled ewers of the mature LC I period. Hence a date within early LC I seems most probable. COMMENT ON CONTEXT An early LC I date is also suggested by the context of the vase. According to the excavation report, the vase was found in the deepest soundings in the east part of the Therasia farmstead.17 At the same depth, and throughout the eastern extent of the 1866 excavations, the described pottery is of the same character: vases and sherds of whitish clay decorated with brown bands.'8 The layer containing this kind of pottery was covered by heavy volcanic material. In this way, the third metre of deposit may be considered contemporary with the Seismic Destruction Level at Akrotiri, dated to early LC I.19 Ioannina V.
