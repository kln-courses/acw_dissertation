CHARD Received 14 June 1962 Field Work The COWA Survey for Area 18 (Northern Asia), No. 3, gives a summary of field researches in Siberia during the years 1959-61 based on information available as of the summer of 1962. (Published by the Council for Old World Archaeology, Inc., ii Divinity Avenue, Cambridge 38, Mass.) The first Soviet radiocarbon dates for Siberian sites will be found in Arctic Anthropology y 1962, 1(1): 84-86 (Address: c/o Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin, Madison 6, Wisconsin). According to the available publications and correspondence, the principal field activities carried out in our area during 1960-61 were the following (information compiled by Barbara P. Merbs): The Tuva archaeological-ethnographical expedition, headed by L. P. Potapov, excavated kurgāns dating to Hun times. Of special interest was the cemetery of KokeF (in SutkhoPskii raion), with its preserved objects of wood. Excavations were carried out by the Mongolian archaeological expedition in Trans-Baikal at the ancient Mongolian city of Khirkhira on the lower reaches of the Khirkhira river. S. V. Kiselev reported the extensive remains consisted of a citadel, a series of fortified country estates of the aristocracy and a great number of ruins of the dwellings of the townspeople. The central building of the citadel stood on a pyramid-like structure and had a tile roof and heating system under the floor, similar to the heating systems in the later palaces in Shenyang and Peking. One house on the outskirts of the city served both as a dwelling and a blacksmithy. In the kurgan at Okoshki Gora remains of three burials were found - unfortunately they had been robbed. A fourth yielded a wooden coffin with the remains of a boy, dressed in rich attire. Here also was found a silver cup of the type of the Buddhist skull cup with a sign of complicated Sanskrit ligature. A. E. Kusnetsov, an authority on Trans-Baikal, has determined that the well-known stele of Genghis Khan's nephew Isunke stood near Khirkhira. Therefore, one may suppose that this city was the central estate of the dynasty of Genghis. There are also indications (tiling, dwelling construction) to support the hypothesis that there existed a much earlier settlement on the site of the city. A. N. Lipskii discovered new Afanasievo burials on the Yenesei which contained large slabs bearing human figures with raised arms and a face crowned with two radiating horns and decorated with tattooed lines. In the southern Altai region S. S. Sorokin continued excavating sites dating from the Bronze Age to the ist millennium b.c.</page><page sequence="2">NORTHEAST ASIA CHESTER S. CHARD 9 A. P. Okladnikov reports that along the Viliui river in north central Siberia rich Neolithic cemeteries, a Neolithic settlement and a distinctive Bronze Age culture have been found. Work is continuing along the Arctic Circle in the region of the construction of the Khantaiskaia Hydroelectric Station. In addition to several Neo- lithic sites along the Viliui, Svetlana Fedoseeva excavated a very important Serovo cemetery. The inventory is basically of the Angara type, but with some differences. In 1961 initial investigations were made in the region of the Zeiaskaia Hydroelectic Station (Amur oblast, near Blagoveshchensk) by the Institute of Economy and Organization of Industrial Production of the Siberian Section of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. under the direction of A. P. Okladnikov. Here were uncovered not only the first finds of stone tools of ancient man in the Amur region, but possibly the oldest in Eastern Siberia and the Soviet Far East. The tools were crudely flaked axes or cleavers manufactured from pebbles. Similar tools have been found in the Far East and Mongolia. Also uncovered in a Neolithic settlement was a large collection of stone tools which included many chipped axes, crude skreblo , thin fine knife-like blades, and also pebble tools and flint nodules. No polished axes were found. The axes were of a type similar to those found in Mongolia and in the region around Khabarovsk. The flint nodules have counterparts in Mongolia, Manchuria and Alaska. Pottery was also present. It is the most ancient on the Zeia river and in general in the Far East and has been dated at about 6000 B.p. Excavations indicated two cultures in the basin of the Zeia river, the first a southern Amur culture of fishermen and agriculturalists, living in large settlements of pit houses, and second a more 'northern' Yakut or Cis-Baikal culture of hunters. At another site along the river metal artifacts were found. Excavations were continued in the ancient Eskimo cemetery at Uelen (Cape Dezhnev), under the direction of S. A. Arutiunov and D. A. Sergeev. Work was centered on one burial complex which consisted of three graves contained in a single stone construction. However, stratigraphy indicated that they were of different time periods. Finds included 'winged objects', big slate knives which may be imitations of metal tools, points of toggle harpoons (both Old Bering Sea and later types), and boomerang-like blades of wood, similar to some found among the Chukchi and Yukaghir. Fuller information is now available on the very important i960 field investigations in Mongolia by A. P. Okladnikov, from whose report in Sovetskaia Etnografia , 1962, 1: 85-89 the following is taken. A. P. Okladnikov's Report Among the newly discovered stone age sites in Mongolia, first we must especially mention the finds of stone tools in the extreme south of the Mongolian People's Republic, within the territory of the Southern Gobi aimak at Ottson-Man't. Here, in the immediate vicinity of the frontier post of the same name, were discovered the oldest stone tools yet known in Mongolia. The post of Ottson-Man't is situated in an extensive valley bounded on the east and west by chains of low hills composed mainly of granites and siliceous slates (effusives). In the middle of the valley granite remnants of odd form protrude. They extend in groups one after another, and</page><page sequence="3">IO ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 6, 1 962 around each such group are scattered stones worked by man. Despite the limited time at our disposal, six separate points of concentration of stone artifacts were brought to light here. Among the latter there stands out clearly a group of objects which reveal features of very great antiquity. A black siliceous stone served as the raw material in their making. The surface of the artifacts was strongly weathered, their facets obliterated and worn smooth by sand. However, the forms of these artifacts were well defined and typologically distinctive. What attracted our atten- tion first of all was the presence of cores of archaic forms which are of common occurrence in the Middle Palaeolithic of Europe, Southwestern Asia and Africa. Such cores are of two types : a . disc-shape cores ; b. cores approaching a prismatic form and in the character of their facets. From these latter cores, blades of a very definite type were removed with well-calculated and well-aimed blows: elongated-triangular with regular clear facets on the backs. Blades of just this sort, including wide long ones with a platform typically bevelled in relation to the cleavage plane, were discovered in large numbers at all six points near the Ottson- Man't post. These cores and blades have features characteristic for the Levallois technique of working stone which in Europe and Africa arose as early as Acheulian times and thereafter continued and achieved its efflorescence in the Mousterian epoch. In due course this technique gave rise to the still more perfected Upper Palaeolithic technique of fracturing stone. The discovery of artifacts of this kind in the depths of Central Asia is important, first, for the reason that it documents the settlement of the nowadays desert regions of the Asiatic continent at a very remote time in human history - in the Middle Palaeolithic, i.e. around 40-50,000 years ago, and possibly even earlier. With these finds we can now open the first chapter of the history of Mongolia - the history of the human occupation of Central Asia. A second conclusion connected with the finds at the frontier post of Ottson-Man't relates to the general characteristics of the culture-historical process on the territory of Central Asia in those distant times. The appearance of a technique of Levallois type attests important changes in the evolution of the industrial activities of man and a definite progressive jump in this sphere. Moreover the appearance of new forms of cores and blades is evidence of the simultaneous progressive evolution both of the organism of primitive man and also of his mental activity - i.e. of the intellect, consciousness and psychics of our distant ancestors. We are speaking of the transition from the palaeoanthropic Neanderthal stage to modern man. . . . In the last decade in Soviet Central Asia, in the basin of the Syr-Daria (Kairak- Kumy, Khodzhikent Cave near Tashkent, Kapchigai Gorge in Ferghana), a series of localities of Levalloiso-Mousterian culture have been discovered; here were found stone artifacts analogous to the newly-discovered objects in the Gobi. At the same time new sites of the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic were uncovered by Chinese scientists in the basin of the Fen river near Ting-ts'un which were essen- tially different from the localities at Choukoutien previously studied. The difference consists in the fact that at Ting-ts'un the finds consist not of choppers (as at Choukoutien) but of tools of the type of Acheulian hand-axes and points approaching west European and, in general, Mediterranean forms. A pronounced 'Western' appearance - in this case Mousterian - is also displayed by the new discoveries of</page><page sequence="4">NORTHEAST ASIA CHESTER S. CHARD II Chinese archaeologists at Chiao-chen (Shansi) between the Hsi-yeh-ho StèM and Wa-yao-ho SSM rivers, where various stone artifacts were found in a layer of reddish clay directly under loess but above a layer of gravel and sand. Among them there are massive skreblo with convex working edge, disc-shape cores of classic forms, equally typical points of triangular outline, and flakes and blades of Mousterian appearance. Here we must especially emphasize that it is precisely this Chiao-chen inventory which finds its closest analogies in Soviet Central Asia where hand-axes of early Acheulian forms have not yet been discovered but, to make up for it, artifacts of Mousterian (including Levalloiso-Mousterian) forms are very widely represented. . . . No less important results for an understanding of the nature of the Palaeolithic culture of Mongolia and its links with cultures of other lands was obtained by us in another region of the Mongolian People's Republic, in the valley of the Orkhon river near Erdeni-Dzu, by the walls of the ancient Mongol capital of Karakorum. The first reconnaissance investigation carried out here by the writer in 1949 showed that the Palaeolithic settlement situated on the left bank of the Orkhon opposite the ruins of ancient Karakorum and the Erdeni-Dzu monastery was remarkable first of all by reason of the abundance of material. An immense quantity of stone worked by ancient man was scattered over it. This is explained by the fact that here over a period of many centuries the raw material for tools was obtained and also worked, and blanks, especially cores, were fashioned. The Palaeolithic settlement on the Orkhon river was thus a place where the most important process in the life of primitive man took place, linked with the basis of his life : the manufacture of tools to work with. It is no less important that the excavations at Erdeni-Dzu not only enabled us to reveal the way of life of Palaeolithic man but also to elucidate the successive steps in the evolution of his culture. As was established by the i960 excavations, the Palaeolithic settlement on the Orkhon river is not a single-level but a stratified site. The differences in the technique of manufacture, in the types and forms of stone artifacts in the different levels of the settlement (there are no less than three of these) reflect important changes in the culture of its ancient inhabitants. The first occupants of the settlement, who left us the artifacts of the third (lower) level, still stood very close to the people of the Middle Palaeolithic in the general appearance of their culture. Very ancient methods of working stone - Levalloiso- Mousterian in principle - predominated among them. The cores found in this level are disc-shape and Levalloiso-Mousterian double-platform and single-platform. Also uncovered here were skreblo , points and wide blades of regular outline. In the inventory of the lower level, in addition, an important place is occupied by pebbles split transversely by one strong blow. Sometimes the split edge of such pebbles is shaped by supplementary flaking and transformed into a massive cutting edge, as on a 'chopper'. There are also points of Mousterian type, with triangular outline and massive cutting edges formed by steep stepped retouch. Such points are similar to certain points from Palaeolithic settlements in Siberia (see A. P. Oklad- nikov in American Antiquity 26, 4). In subsequent levels one can observe the existence of methods of working stone that are identical in principle and also dis- cover kinds of artifacts similar to those found in the lower part of the cultural</page><page sequence="5">12 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 6, 1 962 deposit. But nevertheless a sharp improvement in culture is clearly discernible coinciding with the deposit of the upper level of the settlement. Here, along with massive artifacts made from transversely-split pebbles - choppers, points of Mous- terian type - there appear for the first time cores of actual prismatic type: i.e. those on which the striking platform is perpendicular to the plane of flaking. Tiny scrapers and lamelles are widespread. Of especial interest is the appearance of peculiar 'core-scrapers' of Siberian type, one edge of which presents a sharp edge worked by bifacial retouch, while the other is formed by long longitudinal facets produced as a result of the removal of blades (ibid). In the deeper levels of the settlement such core-scrapers are absent. The culture of the people who left this level is evidently transitional from Palaeolithic to Neolithic, although we did not find here a single purely Neolithic object - e.g. an arrow point or blank for an ax. One could label it in full measure Epipalaeolithic or Mesolithic, although this 'Mesolithic', like the Siberian one, differs sharply from the Mesolithic as known west of the Urals, in Europe, and also in Soviet Central Asia. Besides this, the deposit conditions of the cultural remains - i.e. the stratigraphy of the ancient settlement - has major significance. While the lower horizons of finds are associated with typical diluvium in the form of yellow loam or sandy soil heavily enriched with lime, the upper horizon represents a brownish or brown (chestnut) soil stratum which differs sharply in its dark colouring and structure from the underlying yellow diluvial stratum. Consequently, it belongs in its entirety not to the Pleistocene but to the Recent (Holocene) epoch. Analogous sites of the late Palaeolithic were also found in particularly large numbers in the valley of the Tola river, especially near Mount Zaisan-Tologoi opposite Ulan-Bator, and in a series of places below this mountain along the left bank of the river as far as the airport. The most important site of the succeeding Neolithic epoch is the remarkable settlement (or more accurately, a whole series of settlements) in the region of Dalan-Dzadagada, at the locality of Baindzak (near the well of Shabar-us), which was first discovered and studied by members of the American Central Asiatic Expedition under the leadership of Roy Chapman Andrews. The settlement is located in a distinctive natural-geographic setting. It is associated with a ridge of ancient red dunes on the floor of a vast basin and occupies an extensive area. The cultural deposit is exposed on the surface in those places where the sand of the ancient dunes has been blown away by the winds. Everywhere on the bottom of the dune blowouts lie revealed remains of hearths made of smoothly-worn boulders and pebbles. In the hearths and around them are scattered a multitude of stone artifacts; the raw materials for these were obtained from multi-coloured siliceous rocks - chiefly red and chocolate-coloured jasper, and also yellowish, white and translucent chalcedony. The technique of working stone and the forms of the stone tools attest the fully-developed traditions of a Neolithic culture. The people of Baindzak possessed to perfection all the methods of working stone which are characteristic of the Neolithic epoch. They knew how to polish stone, although they used this method very rarely; they were especially skilled in the art of removing lamelles from a prismatic core; they knew how to retouch delicately flint artifacts,</page><page sequence="6">NORTHEAST ASIA CHESTER S. CHARD 1 3 including stone inset blades for knives, knives and arrow points. Their principal hunting weapon was the bow and arrow. We can feel the existence of definite esthetic ideas by the blanks for beads made of fragments of eggshell of a fossil bird of the Pleistocene period - the ostrich; and also by fragments of ostrich egg shell which are sometimes decorated with very fine engraved designs of a geometric character. An essential feature of the i960 work at Baindzak, in contrast to the work of the American investigators, was that we gathered material from the blowout areas on the basis of their individual small sections. As a result we succeeded in obtaining not simply collections of stone tools of the Neolithic epoch but in recording some- thing much more important: the remains of actual settlements of people of the stone age, the traces of the activity of specific social groups of the distant past. This obvious method enabled us to draw other no less important conclusions of a general- theoretical character. We were able in a general way to break the history of the Neolithic inhabitants of the Gobi into two major stages. To the first and earliest historical stage belong the settlements whose inhabitants had stone tools and pottery which basically were very similar to the stone inventory and pottery of the Cis-Baikal tribes of the Neolithic. The presence of such fragile objects as clay pots shows that in this case we are dealing not with simple cultural links, not merely with an elementary exchange of things. We must suppose that around 4,000 to 5,000 years ago the south of Mongolia as far as the southern Gobi was penetrated by tribes of hunters and fishers of northern origin. These tribes, which spread out from Trans-Baikal and Cis-Baikal, carried with them from north to south not only their usual industrial equipment - their arrow points, knives, inset blades - but also their own distinctive methods of manufacturing clay pots. Their pots in form and method of surface treatment were similar to the Neolithic vessels of the Angara, Lena and Selenga. They had a half-egg shape, a pointed base, and their outer surface was covered with textile impressions, including the typical Cis-Baikal impressions of a woven net, which is characteristic of the Serovo stage of the Cis-Baikal Neolithic. The second Neolithic culture, the remains of which lie in beds of ancient dune deposits higher than the remains of the first culture, belongs to a later time. Its chief difference from the older one is the fact that a new type of pottery appears, in place of the previous one. The outer surface of the vessels is now often decorated with red paint. Sometimes real ornamental painting was employed, executed in black paint on a red background. Changes in the economic life of this period are significantly reflected in the stone querns and pestles used for grinding grain and producing meal. This new period in the history of the ancient tribes of the Gobi is thus marked by the rudiments of primitive farming and the strengthening of cultural links with the Neolithic farmers of neighbouring Manchuria. J. Maringer also came to the same conclusion about a succession of two cultures, the first with northern links and later with southern - i.e. first with Siberia and subsequently with China and Manchuria. The new observations in the Gobi in i960 underline and strengthen the significance of this conclusion first made by the writer as a result of work at Baindzak in 1949.</page><page sequence="7">14 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 6, 1962 Bibliography Abramova, Z.
