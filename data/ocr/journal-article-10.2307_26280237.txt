<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAGNUS EISENGRIM: THE SHADOW OF THE TRICKSTER IN THE NOVELS OF ROBERTSON DAVIES rrfr Russell M. Brown and Donna A. Bennett You see how it was: to him the reality of life lay in external things, whereas for me the only reality was of the spirit—of the mind, as I then thought, not having understood yet what a cruel joker and mean master the intellect can be. Studies of Canadian Literature have tended to characterize it as portraying man besieged by a hostile universe, as being filled with novels whose char acters are either damaged by the world or trapped in a stoical struggle against it. In Butterfly on Rock, D. G. Jones—enlarging on Northrop Frye's notion of the garrison culture as the informing literary force in Canada—describes the archetypal hero as Job, man suffering in a wilderness which is initially the literal one of the land, but which later becomes the community or is internalized within the self.1 Similarly, Margaret Atwood's Survival, though a more personal reading of Canadian literature, underlines analogous themes; the hero of Canadian fiction is a projection of the Canadian identity: he is 1D. G. Jones, Butterfly on Rock (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1970); see es pecially pp. 5-8 and the chapter called "The Problem of Job" (pp. 8S-110).

Ideally the best inhabitants of the world these critics perceive would be some sort of saint (in fact a great deal of attention has been paid to the figure of the saint, both serious and ironic);® the truest gesture, the act of selfless sacrifice.* But this was Canadian literature in an older phase, a literature that affirmed a tragic view of life in which man struggled and was destroyed, frequently because of his own innate weaknesses and flaws. In the last generation, however, and especially in the last decade, there has been a loss of ability to accept a view of order in the universe necessary to make a tragic pattern coherent or comprehensible. In its place a comic vision has developed, one which tends to perceive an aleatory and absurd world, not opposed to man but indifferent to him.® In such a world a new pantheon of heroes must displace the old. For Canada this has especially meant the appearance and positive depiction of a new kind of character in its novels: the trickster, that figure which is opposed to the traditional virtues upon which the old Canadian social ethic is built, virtues such as prudence and dignity. Instead the trickster combines folly and guile, cleverness with recklessness." Although the trickster is a figure relevant to contemporary literature in general, he is particularly interesting in a Canadian setting where, com pared to other literatures, he is a new arrival on the literary scene. His presence in current fiction embodies a response to a relatively recent loss of belief in a providential universe, while at the same time the extent of his prominence is also an indication of an underlying sense of flux and chaos that has, on the deepest level, troubled Canadian writers and disturbed the surfaces of their literary works since the last century. It is this sense that has made "the problem of Job" a central topic, the problem of reconciling man's experience of the universe with conventional wisdom. The emergence of the trickster is significant because he represents not so much an answer to as an escape from that problem: he is, as Stanley Diamond points out in a new edition of Paul Radin's classic study of the trickster, an anti-Job.' •Margaret Atwood, Survival: A Thematic Reading of Canadian Literature (Toronto: Anansi, 1972), passim. • See Stephen Scobie, "Scenes from the Lives of the Saints: A Hagiology of Canadian Literature," Lakehead University Review, 7 (1974), 3-20. 4 See Donald Stephens, "Lilacs Out of the Mosaic Land: Aspects of the Sacrificial Theme in Canadian Fiction," Dalhousie Review, 48 (1969), 500-509. 5 See Robert Kroetsch's comments in Russell M.

Mrs. Severance serves as a prototype for this kind of liberating trickster; Marian in Margaret At wood's The Edible Woman, waiting for her wedding day, is "drifting with the current" that will drown her in meaningless non-being until she is carried into "an eddy of present time" by the parlous obliquity of the college student, Duncan; the protagonists of Margaret Laurence's Manawaka books are repeatedly being tricked into recognizing and acting on their freedom—Rachel, the victim of both Nick's lies and God's jests on her way to Vancouver at last; Stacey, frightened into action by the duplicity of Thor Thorlakson. When Sheila Watson's novel, The Double Hook, was published in 1959, it gave an added dimension to the development of the trickster in fiction by utilizing, and thereby calling attention to, the trickster mythology of the North American Indian. Watson's exploration influenced later writers, most notably Robert Kroetsch who has frequently acknowledged his interest in the trickster and who has made him a central, rather than a secondary, character in his recent novels.8 Now with the recent completion of Robertson Davies' new trilogy, we have in its portrayal of Magnus Eisengrim—the man who has been trans formed from a small boy in Deptford, Ontario, into a "northern wizard"—the most fully developed fictional investigation of the trickster yet to appear. Davies' obvious interest in this figure was undoubtedly stimulated by his fascination with Jungian thought: Freud was an enormous enthusiasm of mine before I was forty; after forty I came to examine the works of his great colleague Carl Gustav Jung, and I have been, over many years, reading and re-reading again the collected works of C. G. Jung.» This reading would have led Davies to Jung's essay "On the Psychology of the Trickster Figure." Coincidentally, this would have put him in contact with the same Indian myth that attracted Watson and Kroetsch.10 The trickster figure, if he appeared at all in earlier Canadian fiction, was not seen in positive terms, but was rather viewed as either an embodiment of the threatening chaotic world against which man struggled, or as an indi »Ethel Wilson, Swamp Angel (Toronto: Macmillan, 1954); Margaret Atwood, The Edible Woman (Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1969); Margaret Laurence, A Jest of God (Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1964), The Fire Dwellers (Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1969): Sheila Watson, The Double Hook (Toronto: McClelland 8: Stewart, 1959); Robert Kroetsch, The Studhorse Man (Toronto: Macmillan, 1969), Gone Indian (Toronto: New Press, 1973). » "Robertson Davies: The Bizarre and Passionate Life of the Canadian People," in Donald Cameron, Conversations with Canadian Novelists (Toronto: Macmillan, 1973), I, 35. 10 Kroetsch specifically encountered the trickster myth in Radin's book; see interview (dted above), p. 6. Jung's essay, translated into English as "On the Psychology of the Trickster Figure," first appeared in Radin's book, and is reprinted in The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, Volume 9.1 of The Collected Works of C. G. Jung (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1959). ROBERTSON DAVIES 349</page><page sequence="4">vidual who threatened social structures important to maintain. In Davies' first novels, the Salterton trilogy, which appeared in the fifties, this attitude may still be seen. Two of the books turn around jokes of a sort—the placing of a false engagement notice in a small town paper (Leaven of Malice), the bitterly whimsical will of a dowager (A Mixture of Frailties)—but in both cases, though the outcome of the joke produces unexpected benefits, the joker is not forgiven: Bevill Higgin stands revealed as malicious, pathetic, and contemptible, while Mrs. Bridgetower is felt as a lingering malevolent pres ence that must be exorcised if a new generation is to begin. At the same time the trickster begins, in these novels, to be characterized with positive features as well. This may be seen, for example, in the character of Humphrey Cobbler, who appears in all three of the Salterton books, the jovial, antisocial, iconoclastic church organist whose antic behaviour at Solly Bridgetower's party in Tempest-Tost brings into the open the hidden emo tions of the men present and thereby allows events to progress to a satis factory conclusion. It is Cobbler who opens Leaven of Malice with a light hearted Halloween witch's Sabbath in the cathedral and who concludes A Mixture of Frailties with a "Joe Miller," a musical joke which juxtaposes the secular and the sacred. It remained for Davies to develop the trickster beyond this relatively minor role only after he left behind his concern with the mannered society of Salterton for his growing interest in the individual states of consciousness around which he built his second trilogy: Fifth Business (1970), The Manticore (1972), and World of Wonders (1975). Fifth Business seems, at first encounter, to belong with Davies' earlier novels, for we are once more involved in the life of a small Ontario town in this chronicle of three boys—Percy Boyd Staunton, Dunstable Ramsay, and Paul Dempster—growing up in Deptford. There is, however, more depth in Deptford than im mediately meets the eye, and the novel's three principals mature into remarkable characters, the stuff of myth rather than of manners. As Ramsay says of them, "We have all rejected our beginnings and become something our parents could not have foreseen." Percy Boyd Staunton becomes "Boy" Staunton, the North American boy-man whom Davies makes into the epitome of the successful entrepreneurial capitalist ("one of the truly rich . . . one of those men whose personal income, though large is a trifling part of the huge mystical body of wealth that stands behind them and cannot be counted"). Dunstable Ramsay, renamed Dunstan after nearly dying in World War I, becomes a teacher and a famous historian who devotes his life to "explorations of the borderland between history and myth," finding him self at last in "the wondrous enclosed garden of hagiology." Paul Dempster's development and transformation is, of the three, the most unlooked for and the most striking. He vanishes from Deptford into the world of the circus, from which he eventually returns metamorphosed into Magnus Eisengrim, the trickster-magician who is the most fascinating and enigmatic character in the novel. 350 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">Most of Fifth Business describes the development of Ramsay and his interaction—which is an unacknowledged rivalry—with Boy Staunton. The central event of the novel takes place in the opening scene, when ten-year-old Boy throws a snowball which, missing Ramsay, strikes Mary Dempster and causes the premature birth of Paul. Paul disappears from the mainstream of events, while Ramsay becomes a friend and eventually the caretaker of Mrs. Dempster, a woman who loses touch with reality after the birth of her son, but who, Ramsay is convinced, is also a miracle-working saint. At the same time Ramsay's continuing relationship with Boy, his "lifelong friend and enemy," comes to define the different worlds to which they belong and the roles to which they aspire: the material realm of which Boy seeks kingship, the world of the spirit in which Dunstan conducts a quest for sainthood. The opposition between the two is also one of past—represented by Dunstan's search for the wellsprings of history in myth and legend—and the present—incarnated in Boy who in his perennial childhood and his fascination with the immediate benefits of modern technology holds Ramsay's anti quarian preoccupations in contempt. This conflict, between life lived in the daily world of surfaces and the continued existence in man of deeply rooted primitive beliefs, is one that Davies pursues throughout Fifth Business. This is a contradiction which interested Jung as well, one which he thought helped to account for the strength of the Indian trickster mythology. Relating anecdotes which demonstrate how individuals can simultaneously heed the calls of a primitive magical world and a modern one, he observes: "The conflict between the two dimensions of consciousness is simply an expression of the polaristic structure of the psyche, which like any other energic system is dependent on the tension of opposites" (9.1, 483).u Jung's conception of the relationship of the trickster to the psyche is a complex one. He suggests it in speaking further on the structure of the psyche in a way that is especially significant to us for the potential insight that it offers into the interrelationship of the three main characters of Fifth Business: The fact is, that this old trichotomous hierarchy of psychic contents (hylic, psychic, and pneumatic) represents the polaristic structure of the psyche, which is the only immediate object of experience. The unity of our psychic nature lies in the middle, just as the living unity of the waterfall appears in the dynamic connection between above and below. Thus, the living effect of the myth is experienced when a higher consciousness, rejoicing in its freedom and independence, is confronted by the autonomy of a mythological figure and yet cannot flee from its fascination, but must pay tribute to the overwhelming impression. The figure works, because secretly it participates in the observer's psyche and appears as its reflection, though it is not recognized as such. It is split off from his consciousness and consequently behaves like an autonomous personality. The trickster is a collective shadow figure, n Parenthetical references are to volume and paragraph numbers of The Collected Works of C. G. Jung. ROBERTSON DA VIES 351</page><page sequence="6">a summation of all the inferior traits of character in individuals. And since the individual shadow is never absent as a component of personality, the collective figure can construct itself out of it continually. (9.1, 484) Jung's comments here need the context of his earlier essays. In "On the Nature o£ the Psyche" he describes the whole of the psyche as a kind of spectrum ranging from physical to spiritual. The lower portion of this spectrum, which arises out of the "organic material substrate," Jung variously identifies with the unconscious, with the instinct and its drives, and with emotions and sensations. The upper part of the spectrum, the supraconscious, is the realm of the spirit, of "feeling" in the Jungian sense of evaluation, and of the archetypes—which, by virtue of the way the psyche curves back upon itself, it furnishes to the lower level of the unconscious, thus becoming the source of images found in the collective unconscious. The psyche proper—which is associated with the ego, with the will, and with consciousness and cognition—lies between these two, not existing autonomously as they do, but rather deriving its existence from the way these other two psychic components overlap: The psyche is made up of processes whose energy springs from the equilibration of all kinds of opposites. The spirit/instinct antithesis is only one of the commonest formulations, but it has the advantage of reducing the greatest number of the most important and most complex psychic processes to a common denominator. So regarded, psychic processes seem to be balances of energy flowing between spirit and instinct ... . (8, 407) This Jungian opposition is obviously the informing force behind Davies' depiction of Ramsay and Staunton. They are individuals who represent the psychic poles, each exemplifying the dangers of imbalance of which Jung warns: A poorly developed consciousness, for instance, which because of massed projections is inordinately impressed by concrete or apparently concrete things and states, will naturally see in the instinctual drives the source of all reality. It remains blissfully unaware of the spirituality of such a philosophical surmise, and is convinced that with this opinion it has established the essential instinctuality of all psychic processes. Conversely, a consciousness that finds itself in opposition to the instincts can, in consequence of the enormous influence then exerted by the archetypes, so subordinate instinct to spirit that the most grotesque "spiritual" complications may arise out of what are undoubtedly biological happenings. (8, 407) These are the extremes personified, on the one hand, by the materialistic, sexually-driven Boy, "the quintessence of the Jazz Age," whose limited concept of the spirit is epitomized by the world-celebrating teachings of the Reverend Leadbeater, a man who sees God's beauty in the handful of gemstones he carries in his pocket, and, on the other hand, by the ascetic saint-seeking Ramsay, who grows old with "a whole great piece of . . . life that is un lived, denied, set aside." Separately, each lacks wholeness; together they may benefit one another, provide the psychic wholeness that each separately 352 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">lacks. They demonstrate Jung's dictum, that "although physical and spiritual passion are deadly enemies, they are nevertheless brothers-in-arms" (8, 414). Jung suggests that a lack of proper psychic balance is a particularly modern problem. The remedy he proposes in "On the Nature of the Psyche" provides the final needed gloss on the passage cited above from his essay on the trickster, and clarifies Paul Dempster's function in his guise as Magnus Eisengrim: Psychic processes . . . behave like a scale along which consciousness "slides." At one moment it finds itself in the vicinity of instinct, and falls under its influence; at another, it slides along to the other end where spirit predominates and even assimilates the instinctual processes most opposed to it. These counter-positions, so fruitful of illusion, are by no means symptoms of the abnormal; on the contrary, they form the twin poles of that psychic one-sidedness which is typical of the normal man of today. . . . This "sliding" consciousness is thoroughly characteristic of modern man. But the one-sidedness it causes can be removed by what I have called the "realization of the shadow." . . . the growing awareness of the inferior part of the personality, which should not be twisted into an intellectual activity, for it has far more the meaning of a suffering and a passion that implicate the whole man. (8, 408-09) Eisengrim is the trickster and the shadow in the book. The sinister projection of the once much abused child Paul, he has become a Wolf that stands between a Boy and a Saint." His transformation, described at length in the concluding part of the trilogy, is the result of a psychic journey into the inferno of a traveling circus, a voyage in which he ex changes innocence for mystery, eschews love for authority, and becomes finally his own greatest creation. He is the reflection of the psyche of which Jung speaks, produced in that crucial conjunction of matter and spirit with which the novel opens. Davies' whole trilogy is ultimately concerned with man's need for this trickster, along with his need to come to terms with the shadow which the trickster represents. One of the important things man must learn is that the shadow is not to be dreaded or detested, that—as Jung several times points out—the ap parent inferiority and evil appearance of the shadow may be misleading. In the essay on the trickster Jung speaks of the positive aspects of the shadow in a way that is again illuminating of Davies' use of the figure: . . . the shadow, although by definition a negative figure, sometimes has certain clearly discernible traits and associations which point to a quite different back ground. It is as though he were hiding meaningful contents under an unprepos sessing exterior. Experience confirms this; and what is more important, the things that are hidden usually consist of increasingly numinous figures. The first thing "In the concluding scene of Fifth Business Eisengrim explains that his name was given him by Liesl: "It comes from one of the great northern beast fables, and it means Wolf." Near the end of World of Wonders, Liesl explains further: "I was acquainted with the great beast-legends of Europe, and in Reynard the Fox, you know, there is the great wolf Eisengrim, whom everyone fears, but who is not such a bad fellow, really." ROBERTSON DAVIES 353</page><page sequence="8">we find standing behind the shadow is the anima, who is endowed with considerable power of fascination and possession. She often . . . hides in her turn the powerful archetype of the wise old man (sage, magician, king, etc.). (9.1, 485) A powerful anima does indeed stand behind the trickster-shadow in Fifth Business, which suggests much about the structure of Ramsay's quest. Mary Dempster serves as his anima and dominates the course of his life: weighed upon by guilt-feelings about her apparent loss of reason after she takes the blow meant for him, distrustful of his own mother after a traumatic childhood encounter, Ramsay fastens upon Paul's mother with earnest devotion. Convinced that she has performed three miracles, he is led into his lifelong investigation of sainthood, seeking to understand not only the nature of saints but the source of the world's need for saintly figures. Ramsay's pursuits carry him to the Jesuits of the Société des Bollandistes, where he meets Padre Blazon, the man who helps him understand the mean ing of Mary Dempster: . . she would never have got past the Bollandists, but she must have been an extraordinary person, a great lover of God, and trusting greatly in His love for her. As for the miracles, you and I have looked too deeply into miracles to dogmatize; you believe in them, and your belief has coloured your life with beauty and good ness. . . . your life has been illuminated by your fool-saint, and how many can say so much?" Padre Blazon is, of course, the Jungian old man, the sage that Ramsay finds hidden behind the anima. This theatrical, half-comic Jesuit, uncom fortably tolerated by the Bollandists "for his great learning and for what was believed to be his great age," shows Ramsay the limitations of the enquiries he has made thus far (and by implication of the life he has led) by teaching him of the other, the underground, aspects of sainthood. He concludes one of his lectures: "But all this terrible talk about the saints is not disrespect, Ramezay. Far from it! It is faith! It is love! It takes the saint to the heart by supplying the other side of his character that history or legend has suppressed. . . . Mankind cannot endure perfection; it stifles him. He demands that even the saints should cast a shadow. If they, these holy ones who have lived so greatly but who still carry their shadows with them, can approach God, well then, there is hope for the worst of us." This understanding of the dual aspect of Ramsay's beloved hagiography is but part of Padre Blazon's own search, for he professes himself "deep in the old man's puzzle, trying to link the wisdom of the body with the wisdom of the spirit until the two are one." Thus Ramsay's preoccupation with Paul's birth allows him to fall under the domination of his anima; his quest for the meaning of her existence carries him to his sage; Blazon in turn sends him back to seek under standing of what has so far eluded the saint-ridden Ramsay: the nature of the shadow. It is this shadow, embodied in the trickster figure, that can 354 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">join the pneumatic wisdom with the hylic, as Blazon knows. "At my age," he warns Ramsay, "you cannot divide spirit from body without anguish and destruction, from which you will speak nothing but crazy liesl" Having rediscovered Paul once before (as Faustus Legrand, a magician in a small traveling show), Ramsay finds him again after his discussions with Blazon—now fully realized in his identity as Magnus Eisengrim. Traveling for a while with Eisengrim's troupe, Ramsay senses part of the answer to Blazon's "old man's puzzle" in the person of the beautiful Faustina. Eisengrim concludes each performance with a magical skit called The Vision of Dr. Faustus which portrays the conflict between "sacred and profane love for the soul of Faust." His assistant, Faustina, portrays both female parts, the modest, domestic Gretchen and the erotic Venus, in a way that for Ramsay "conveyed unmistakably the message that beauty of spirit and lively sensuality might inhabit one body." In the company of Eisengrim, Ramsay learns this lesson experientially as well—by spending a night of physical struggle and passion with Liesl, the grotesque woman who is the source of Paul's magic. From her he also learns the limitations of sainthood in the world in which man must dwell. "How can you really be good to anybody," she chides him, "if you are not good to yourself?" The failure of Ramsay's conception of saint liness is further underlined shortly afterwards when he tries to communicate to the wandering mind of Mary Dempster the news that he has been in touch with her son: the result is disastrous, for he succeeds only in pushing her into a final and bitter madness from which she never recovers. It is not in the company of his saint, but with her offspring, the trickster, who is the product of her self-destructive union with the rigorous puritan morality of her husband Amasa, that Ramsay must find the resolution he seeks. This resolution takes place in the book's penultimate scene, one which brings the three principals together for the first time. In this climatic scene of revelation, we discover that the trouble-causing snowball was more potent than we had previously suspected, for it had carried a rock inside, an appropriate weapon for the material Boy. Ramsay, acting for Boy as the "keeper of his conscience and keeper of the stone," has clung to this source of the past and vainly tries to impress Boy with its significance: ". . . for God's sake, get to know something about yourself. The stone-in the-snowball has been characteristic of too much you've done for you to forget it foreverl" But Staunton, a man without memory, living only in the present, has indeed forgotten the event and cannot understand the guilt that Ramsay expects him to feel. Paul has also been asked to feel guilt about his mother's fate: his puritanical father implicates him for his very act of birth. But Paul, while understanding the nature of guilt (which Boy does not), refuses to accept its burden: "I was too young for the kind of guilt my father wanted me to feel; he had an extraordinary belief in guilt as educative force. I couldn't stand it. I cannot feel guilt now." ROBERTSON DAVIES 355</page><page sequence="10">However, if Paul Dempster cannot feel guilt over Iiis role in life's events, he, nevertheless, can join with Ramsay in extracting the final penance from Boy, helping to set straight what Dunstan calls their "moral bookkeeping" that ends Fifth Business. As Magnus Eisengrim, he does this by putting Boy in touch with his own shadow, with that unrecognized dimension of life which, as Liesl warns Ramsay, if unlived will take revenge on man and make a fool of him. Magnus grants Boy's inmost wish, the desire that Staunton has previously voiced ("I wish I could get into a car and drive away from the whole damned thing") and that Ramsay has already inter preted for him: "A truly mythological wish . . . you want to pass into oblivion with your armour on, like King Arthur." Following a final con versation with Eisengrim in which Boy at last articulates his terror of growing old and his distaste at having to play the public role the government is now offering him, he dredges from his subconscious images that of the abdication of the man once his greatest hero, the Prince of Wales. At the urging of Eisengrim to "do something symbolic" with the stone, Boy places it in his mouth and drives his Cadillac into the waters of the Toronto harbour.18 The synthesis of Eisengrim, Ramsay, and Staunton cannot hold, and Boy is destroyed by his encounter with the shadow. Eisengrim has, however, served as a catalyst, releasing both Ramsay and Staunton from their stasis so that Dunstan can speak at last, protest the unexpiated guilt, finally challenge Boy in a way that makes him realize that his reign has ended and that the time for fulfillment of his wish is at hand. The death of Boy Staunton only seems to end the potential for harmony between instinct and spirit, however. As The Manticore and, especially, World of Wonders make clear, a new triad replaces the old, with Liesl taking Boy's place as the representative of the material world. Staunton's death in 1968 marks the end of the material domination of the modern era which has neglected the demands of mind and spirit. Magnus' magical world displaces Boy's material one, but it draws its powers from Liesl's great wealth even as Eisengrim has gained his seemingly magical powers over the world of matter by mastering the secrets of the clockwork toys at Liesl's ancestral home. Liesl's home and Liesl's bed come, finally, to unite the three of them. The forces which could not be joined in Fifth Business (though even there we know that after the final events of the novel Ramsay seems to have accepted Liesl's invitation to come to Switzerland) are fully integrated in World of Wonders. The Manticore, the book that stands between Ramsay's self-justifying nar rative in Fifth Business and his history of Eisengrim in World of Wonders, "Most of these details are not revealed until World of Wonders. At the end of Fifth Business, the reader is led to presume that Eisengrim's part in Staunton's death may have been much more significant, that he may even have used hypnosis to convince Staunton to fulfill his self-destructive fantasy. In World of Wonders, Eisengrim rather disingenuously denies all responsibility while relating the details of his final conversation with Staunton. 356 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">acts as interlude—focusing not on Boy, but on Boy's son, David Staunton. A mythicized psychohistory, a fictionalized introduction to what Davies calls the "Comedy Company of the Psyche," it is a novelistic introduction to Jungian psychoanalysis. While in Fifth Business the division between physical and spiritual prevented the existence of a psychic center, in The Manticore David, who is the spiritual son of Dunstan as well as the physical offspring of Boy, is the rational, cognitive man who is out of touch with both body and soul. Not surprisingly the first need his Swiss analyst identifies is his need to become acquainted with his shadow. David discovers that he detests his shadow in himself and is repelled by those on whom he projects it. Eisengrim is one in whom David sees the shadow, and we learn that he felt a deep antipathy toward him when he attended (at the end of Fifth Business) one of his performances. "Shall I tell you why? Because he was making fools of us all, and so cleverly that most of us liked it; he was a con man of a special kind, exploiting just that element in human credulity that most arouses me—I mean the desire to be deceived. . . . it's a kind of abject surrender, an abdication of common sense. I am a victim of it now and then." Despite his dislike of the man, David is moved to shout a question to Eisen grim's oracular brazen head, receiving an answer that disrupts his life and begins his psychic quest. David has chosen his profession of "criminal lawyer" (savoring the ambiguity of the term) because of the intensity of his desire to suppress the shadow, but paradoxically he finds himself defending it and working to prevent its prosecution. In the course of his analysis David learns to acknowledge his unpleasant shadow self, his frightening trickster nature; however, it is not until he leaves therapy and encounters Eisengrim, Ramsay, and Liesl that he is forced to go beyond intellectual comprehension and confront his shadow directly. To appreciate fully this climatic development of The Manticore in the context of the trickster myth, it is necessary to mention two anatomical anomalies that characterize the anthropomorphic Indian Trickster: an enormous phallus, which he carries in a box on his back, and vast quantities of intestines which he keeps wrapped around his body. These two features suggest those facets of humanity, man's sexuality and his excretory needs, which he finds hardest to reconcile with his rational nature. They provide the basis for popular tales of Trickster's comic debasements: remarkable sexual escapades, including that of sending his penis swimming across a river to visit a chief's daughter, and scatological fables such as the widely occurring tale of the laxative bulb. (Trickster, eating of this bulb despite previous warnings, is forced to defecate so much that he must climb higher and higher into a tree for refuge, finally falling back into his own feces.) Davies, in The Manticore, and Kroetsch, in books such as The Studhorse Man and Gone Indian, may be thought of as dividing these two aspects of the trickster between them, for, just as the phallus is central to Kroetsch's books, ROBERTSON DAVIES 357</page><page sequence="12">defecation is an important image in The Manticore, one which underlines David's search for psychic wholeness. One of David's prominent childhood memories is of the humiliating treatments he received for constipation, an ailment he suggests is particularly prevalent in rural Canada where "Farm people understandably dreaded their draughty privies in winter and cultivated their powers of retention." Such constipation becomes emblematic of the extreme self-restraint that individuals such as David have imposed on their feelings and instincts. Grandfather Staunton's crude remedy—"the harsh invading spike"—is a "forcing of Nature" that makes worse what it is meant to cure. Intended to make man's natural urges accord to some intellectually predetermined schedule, the weekly enemas become a ritual designed to purge David of his baser nature, administered by a man who is the antithesis of the trickster. Instead of inspiring or expelling laughter, David's grandfather seems to consume it: "he did not blow laughter out, he sucked it in, with a noise that sounded like a snuk-snuk, snuk-snuk, snuk-snuk." Taught by this elderly physician that man is full of poisons in need of purgation, David has his association of defecation and depravity rein forced by an adolescent experience. Encouraged by a companion, Bill Unsworth, to join in the wanton destruction of a summer home, he is horrified when their rampage culminates in a scene that comes to seem to him the emblem of man's potential for evil. He [Unsworth] jumped on the table, stripped down his trousers and squatted over the photographs. Clearly he meant to defecate on them, but such things cannot always be commanded, and so for several minutes we stood and stared at him as he grunted and swore and strained and at last managed what he wanted, right on the family photographs. How long it took I cannot tell, but they were crucial moments in my life. For as he struggled, red-faced and pop-eyed, and as he appeared at last with a great stool dangling from his apelike rump, I regained by senses. . . . The destruction was simply a prelude to this. It is a dirty, animal act. . . . It is because of this background that we fully appreciate the trick that Liesl plays on David in the book's conclusion, a joke producing a moment of sheer terror that causes David to lose control of his bowels. In his abjec tion, David is reborn, released into feeling at last. In befouling himself he gains a direct acquaintance with all that seemed vile in man, yet he is still able, carrying this unpleasant awareness, to struggle out of the cave into which Liesl had lured him and back to the light. There, freed from the psychic paralysis which had disabled him, he is ready to return home to Canada, to defend an individual on whom he had hitherto unknowingly projected his own shadow. By discovering a psychic unity within himself, David is also brought, during his time spent with Ramsay, Eisengrim, and Liesl, to perceive a unity in the world. Where before he has seen and despised himself as literally a "devil's advocate," defending evil from good, crime from the 358 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">pursuit of justice, now he begins to understand the complex kind of chess that his trickster-mentors play: "Each player plays both black and white. If the player who draws white at the beginning plays white on boards one, three, and five, he must play black on boards two and four. . . . you can't play the white pieces on all the boards. Only people who play on one, flat board can do that,, and then they are in agonies trying to figure out what black's next move will be. Far better to know what you are doing, and play from both sides." The desire to see the unity of a world made up of black and white, good and evil, sun and shadow, is behind Ramsay's new interest in World of Wonders, that belated extension to his hagiography: his considerations regarding the nature of that arch-trickster, the devil. (We are reminded that in Fifth Business Padre Blazon and Liesl recommend Ramsay's becoming acquainted with the devil: "The Devil knows corners of us all of which Christ Himself is ignorant.") In the course of World of Wonders, one of the characters quotes Robert Louis Stevenson: "I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous, and independent denizens." Although Paul Dempster's teacher and model, the actor Sir John Tresize, resists the suggestion that they "put the incongruous denizens on the stage," Davies does not resist, introducing them once more to his novel. Magnus Eisengrim, while completing his role in a film biography of the magician Robert Houdin, tells his life story to the three men responsible for the movie, men who divide between them the hylic, pneumatic, and psychic aspects of the mind: Kinghovn, the cameraman who is guided only by perception and who lives wholly in the material world ("Give me thingsl Give me the appearance of a thing"); Lind, the brooding Swedish director who gives artistic shape to the film and who lives with "one foot in Odin's realm"; and Roland Ingestree, the producer and guiding intelligence that holds the project together ("one of the New Men . . . committed to a theatre of ideas"). Ingestree does not immediately recognize Eisengrim, but as Paul Dempster's life story unfolds it is revealed that the two men were shaped by a common experience, their participation in Sir John's acting company—an experience that has left them paired in that vital antagonism of psyche and shadow. Ramsay, in his meditation on the devil, comes to view humor as one of his principal attributes. Liesl and Ingestree respond to him by describing the Devil as a joker whose jests may benefit mankind: "... monotheism leaves no room for jokes, and I've thought for a long time that is what is wrong with it. Monotheism is too po-faced for the sort of world we find ourselves in. . . . Whereas the Devil, when he is represented in literature, is full of excellent jokes, and we can't resist him because he and his jokes make so much sense. To twist an old saying, if the Devil had not existed, we should have to invent him. He is the only explanation of the appalling ambiguities of life. I give you the Devil!" ROBERTSON DAVIES 359</page><page sequence="14">Following this speech of Ingestree's, Ramsay warns him that the devil might be tempted to "throw a joke or two in your direction that would test your sense of humour." Before the novel is over this sense of humor is seriously put to the test by Magnus Eisengrim. Eisengrim is, in his concluding part of the trilogy, both more human (in his autobiographical recollections) and more diabolic (in his present persona). Becoming the devilish joker of which Ramsay has warned, he slowly springs a series of narrative jokes on Ingestree. His humor derives from his control of the tale he tells; in recounting this narrative he becomes not only trickster but true magician, the author-creator of events, the God and devil of his imagined universe. "[Eisengrim's] laugh troubled me," said Lind. "I am not good at humour, and I like to be perfectly sure what people are laughing at. Do you know what it was, Ramsay?" "Yes," I said, "I think I do. That was Merlin's laugh. . . . The magician Merlin had a strange laugh, and it was heard when nobody else was laughing. He laughed at the beggar who was bewailing his fate as he lay stretched on a dunghill; he laughed at the foppish young man who was making a great fuss about choosing a pair of shoes. He laughed because he knew that deep in the dunghill was a golden cup that would have made the beggar a rich man; he laughed because he knew that the pernickety young man would be stabbed in a quarrel before the soles of his new shoes were soiled. He laughed because he knew what was coming next." The whole of Eisengrim's autobiographical revelation, his own knowledge of what was coming next, has several functions. It allows the reader to see how Paul Dempster was transformed into a shadow, a "fetch" (Eisengrim glosses this word as a supernatural double; it also means "trick"), a wolf, and a magical trickster. It provides Eisengrim with an opportunity to take a long-delayed revenge on an old opponent, the hyperrational man, In gestree. Finally, it allows us to glimpse the vision—the "world of wonders"— that awaits the individual who fully integrates the mind and the shadow in a way that allows him to escape his "one-sidedness." Liesl identifies this integrated vision with a lost way of seeing the world: "You have read Spengler? No: it is not so fashionable as it once was. But Spengler talks a great deal about what he calls the Magian World View, which he says we have lost, but which was part of the Weltanshauung—you know the world outlook—of the Middle Ages. It was a sense of the unfathomable wonder of the invisible world that existed side by side with a hard recognition of the roughness and cruelty and day-to-day demands of the tangible world. It was a readiness to see demons where nowadays we see neuroses, and to see the hand of a guardian angel in what we are apt to shrug off ungratefully as a stroke of luck. It was religion, but a religion with a thousand gods, none of them all-powerful and most of them ambiguous in their attitude toward man. It was poetry and wonder which might reveal themselves in the dunghill, and it was an under standing of the dunghill that lurks in poetry and wonder. It was a sense of living in what Spengler called a quivering cavern-light which is always in danger of being swallowed up in the surrounding impenetrable darkness." 360 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="15">Later Eisengrim responds: "I don't talk about a Magian World View; I've no touch with that sort of thing. In so far as it concerns me, I live it. It's just the way things strike me, after the life I've lived, which looks pretty much like a World of Wonders when I spread it out before me, as I've been doing. Everything has its astonishing wondrous aspect, if you bring a mind to it that's really your own." In what Ramsay would speak of as "one of those coincidences that it may be wiser to call synchronicities," while Davies has been creating in Magnus Eisengrim one of the most engaging characters in Canadian fiction, Canada has also produced one of the most successful magicians since Houdini, Doug Henning. Henning, writing about his magic, recently unconsciously echoed Eisengrim's words: I am as amazed as my audience at what occurs and I respond with awe and a kind of innocence, to the wonder you should feel about the world. My magic is a metaphor for the real magic in the world." One way of understanding the new interest in a "magian world view," the fascination offered by Magnus Eisengrim and his real life counterpart, as well as the reason for the appearance of a host of fictional tricksters in contemporary Canadian writing, is by referring to Joseph Campbell's discussion of the trickster in The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology. There Campbell differentiates between two models of society, one based on agricul ture, the other on hunting, suggesting that it is only in the latter culture that myths containing the trickster figure occur. The agricultural society lacks the trickster myth because it is one in which the interests of the group is primary. Its religious structure reflects this in that it is based on a "socially annointed priesthood," transmitting received wisdom by means of formal liturgy, the priest serving as an intermediary between the Olympian world and man's daily existence. Because the preservation of group stability is of high priority, self-sacrifice is valued above self-discovery. The emblematic statement of this social ethic is con tained in the Biblical maxim: "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."1* By contrast, in the hunting culture the individual has more importance; there remains more latitude for what Campbell calls "the highly dangerous and unpredictable force of human endowment." The priest is replaced by the shaman, the individual acting solely on his own, not sanctioned by society but independently discovering his power. In this society, received wisdom is replaced by individual vision, Apollonian control begins to be sacrificed for Dionysiac ecstasy, and the seeking of social foundation is trans formed into questing for psychological roots, leading the individual inward uNew York Times, 21 December 1975. » The extent to which these values have, until recently, been pervasively Canadian is suggested by the fact that Hugh MacLennan used this Biblical verse as the epigraph to Each Man's Son in 1951. ROBERTSON DAVIES 361</page><page sequence="16">until he is in touch with his own inner symbolism and myth, no longer an agent of nor a participant in the public symbolism of the larger social order. The shaman characteristically discovers his powers through a kind of break down, a rupture in his sense of continuity within the world and with the community. Out of this mental crisis comes his new inner knowledge and his source of strength: hence the glorification of sacrifice is replaced by the myth of individual death and rebirth." A shaman faces problems that a priest never encounters. Not a passive transmitter of divine will and law, he is rather himself the creator, the generator, of magic. Hence he must have a sense of self that a priest never has: a personal awareness both of his potential power and of his potential fallibility, knowledge of his shortcomings, even his reliance on chicanery, coupled with a belief in his efficacy on the external and internal condition of others. One way to understand the trickster figure as he occurs in the myth of this culture is as a projection of the shamanistic consciousness; he is, as Campbell calls him, "a super-shaman." The literary trickster seen in recent Canadian fiction is also closely related to the shaman. Ramsay's fictitious biography of Paul Dempster has the young magician selected and trained by an Eskimo shaman and his colleagues. Davies' new play, "Question Time," has a shaman for one of its principal characters. The emergence of a shamanistic trickster as a culture hero in Canadian fiction tells us much about the way the Canadian artist views his society just now. A new emphasis on individual freedoms has displaced the im portance traditionally given social stability. The ideal of selfless sacrifice seems less desirable than the goal of personal survival. The problem of Job is being, not solved, but responded to—with the example of Prometheus. The hero is no longer Adam-like, losing his innocence and falling into culture; rather he defies the powers that would restrain him, making his own raids on the forbidden mysteries of the divine. Law is being replaced by magic. In Who Has Seen the Wind, the school teacher Miss Thompson responds to a crisis in events by thinking she "could imagine no greater feeling of futility if she were asked to pull rabbits from a hat. Magic was needed." The nameless narrator of Atwood's Surfacing says, almost as though in response, "Everyone now can do a little magic." In Beautiful Losers F. says, "do not be a magician, be magic" (which could almost be paraphrased as advice to choose the immediacy of the shaman rather than the intermediacy of the priest). It is this magic that Magnus Eisengrim offers us, "an entertainment of mystery and beauty, with perhaps a hint of terror": M Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology (New York: Viking, 1959), pp. 229-81. Campbell there mentions the belief "that great shamans are reborn three times" (p. 267); significantly, Paul Demptser is reborn thrice: as Mungo Fetch, as Faustus Legrand, and finally as Magnus Eisengrim.

Brown, "Adele Wiseman and the Canadian Novel: Moving Beyond Sacrifice," Journal of Canadian Fiction (forthcoming). 362 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">He received us as honoured guests and promised us an evening of such visions and illusions as had nourished the imagination of mankind for two thousand years—and a few trifles for amusement as well. In the conclusion of his 1952 novel, The Mountain and the Valley, Ernest Buckler provides this apostrophe to the Canadian people: They're rough in their speech and in their bodies, but when they're sober they're never thinking sly thoughts. They curse and they bla'guard, but it's not really cursing and bla'guarding at all, it's so thoughtless—there's never any cast of chill or connivance about anything like that they do. And when they do stop to think of anything they've done and are penitent, they're hurt more keenly and in expressibly in the penitence than the offended ever was by the deed. When each of their days is over, all its roughness is rubbed out when they quiet down to sleep, like the innocent erasure of a child's sleep. . . . They're the best people in the whole world. But in Question Time, when asked "What's wrong with the Beaver?" the Herald responds: "Will it suffice if I say that no country can hope to rise above the mediocrity if it lacks a mystique of courage, the humour, and also the cunning and roguery of its people—" By investigating the trickster, the shaman, and the shadow, Davies and his contemporaries are recording the coming into being of—and even helping to create—that mystique.
