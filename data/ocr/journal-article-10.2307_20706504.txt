Beware of the front door of my house; my house is my marae, the front door has the front step. Excerpt from "Chant on a Marae" (Henry 1928:151). In this article, important archaeological, ethnohistorical, and traditional evidence is used for reconstructing Protohistoric Polynesian settlement behaviour patterns. The spatial distribution of simple marae or religious structures in Mo4 orea's Opunohu Valley are explained as religious compon ents of households and essential for the sanctification of household activities. It is also suggested that the practice of appending simple to large complex marae is evidence of Polynesian ramage fissioning or the segmentation of nonunilineal descent groups, where junior households appended simple marae to larger parent marae. The religious vestiges are reflections of ritual practices, representing the social, the political, and the cultural of the Opunohu inhabitants. The repetitive spatial pattern in Tupaururu is an attempt to conserve threatened institutionalised Ma4ohi practices. Marae were the single most valued structures for the Ma Ohi, the native peoples of the Society Islands (Oliver 1974:6). Henry (1928:142) describes the simplest family marae as "a paving set upon the ground and walled in with stone slabs 3 or 4 feet [0.91 to 1.22 m] high, each slab to the left and right representing a member of the household". At Lake Maeva on Huahine, Tyerman and Bennet noted that small marae associated with larger marae might be for more intimate, familial rites as opposed to the more public rites of the larger marae, [t]he great marae itself was dedicated to Tani, the father of the gods here; but the whole ground adjacent was marked with the vestiges of smaller maraes ? private places for worship and family interment... (Montgomery 1831:1:198 9, cited in Oliver 1974:886). Archaeological data collected by Green ( 1961 a, 1961 b ; Green and Descantes 1989; Green et al. 1967) from the 'Opunohu are used in examining the spatial 187</page><page sequence="2">188 Christophe Descantes patterning and function of simple marae. Incorporating the overlap of archaeology, ethnohistory, tradition, and ecological evidence (Green 1967:125), I add statistical measures and spatial arrangements to make sociopolitical interpretations of the stone structures in the 'Opunohu (see Garanger 1964:6; Green 1967:102). Stone structures and settlement spaces are symbolic expressions that constitute and structure a complex Ma4 ohi chief dorn within specific spatial and historical contexts. Their symbolic meanings mediate between behaviour and material culture in many different contexts (see Hodder 1982:228). For example, the "Chant on Marae" from the priests Tamera and Pati'i records that: [t]he gods could not be deceived. When persons approached a place where stood a marae, they gave it wide berth, they lowered their clothes from their shoulders down to their waists, and carried low their burden in their hands, until they got out of sight of it (Henry 1928:150). Consideration of the stone structures as symbols allows an understanding of their active roles, including the manner in which their spatial distributions reflected social practice and ordered the stratified social system of the Opunohu Valley inhabitants. In Polynesian prehistory it is the continuity of the historically recorded contact period with the immediate archaeological past that allows for much interpretive extraction from ethnohistories. Primary and secondary ethnohistoric sources and the archaeological record contribute information on ethnographic and temporal contexts of Ma4ohi society. This combination illuminates the meanings and functions of artefacts (see Hodder 1982) or, in this case, stone structures, within particular culture historical and spatial contexts. The records are not tested against one another, assuming the accuracy of one over the other. Instead, they are evaluated and applied in a complementary fashion, contributing to a possible explanation of simple marae distribution during early European contact in the Opunohu Valley. OPUNOHU VALLEY The Society Islands extend from 16? to 18? south latitude and from 148? to 155? west longitude in the South Pacific Ocean. A high island, Mo Orea lies 25 km north-west of Tahiti in the Windward Islands group. Opunohu Bay extends 4 km into Mo4 orea's north coast. The Opunohu Valley is bounded by eroded caldera walls and occupies an area of 1,500 ha (Fig. 1 ). Paopao Bay is situated on the north-east side of Mo Orea, with the smaller Paopao Valley extending into the remaining portion of the caldera. In their lower sections,</page><page sequence="3">Simple Marae of the 'Opunaohu Valley 189 these valleys are separated by Mount Rotui which rises 899 m above the caldera floor. The bottom of the caldera is watered by the' Opunohu River that branches into innumerable dendritic tributaries in the upper portions of the valley (Green 1961a: 169; Henry 1928:92). Mo'orea Figure 1. Opunohu Valley. Note: shaded settlement areas denote the borders of the map units containing settlements. The Opunohu Valley is not a closed or isolated system, but a bounded one. Other parts of Mo'orea were accessible from the coast or via inland trails. Bicknell and Henry (1805:42) report that, in the eastern section of the valley, "[t]he natives informed [us] that there were roads across the mountains from most parts of the island to this place", and Henry (1928:92) states that, "Ha'apiti is only separated from Opunohu by a low ridge of the central mountain barrier, over which is a pass connecting the two sides of the island". Green (1961a: 169) divides the Opunohu into three sections: the Coastal plains, Amehiti to the west, and Tupaururu to the east. I myself (Descantes 1990:28-33) added a middle section between Amehiti and Tupaururu because of ridges originating from the peaks of the caldera walls delimiting three</page><page sequence="4">190 Christophe Descantes physical sections noted in an economic assessment of the valley by the Soci?t? d'Equipement de Tahiti et des ?les (SETIL) in 1962. A gentle sloping area of alluvial soils characterises the Coastal plains. Each inland section is made up of two cross-cutting zones. Green et al (1967:117) based the division of the upper and lower zones of the valley at the start of Mau'aroa, the central ridge separating the valley sections. My own (Descantes 1990:33-5) upper and lower divisions are based on the differentiation of major soil types (SETIL 1962:30). Ecological variation between the valley sections is minimal, with Tupaururu having the advantage of gentler relief, but a disadvantage in its humidity and precipitation (SETIL 1962:43). Predominantly found in the upper valley are ridges (aivi) with degraded soil areas covered with staghorn fern. Unlike Amehiti and the Middle section, Tupaururu settlement areas lack fern-covered ridges, which may be from ancient or modern deforestation, cattle-grazing, and gardening. These conspicuous ridges contained no sites but were essential reference points in constructing survey maps (Green, personal communication, 1988). Today, much of the upper valley is covered with a wet forest, mostly of large aboriginally introduced mope or Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus edulis) trees. The growth of the forest is thought to have been a relatively recent development. In October of 1777, the artist Webber on Captain Cook's third Pacific voyage depicted no forest in his painting "A View of Aimeo Harbour [Opunohu Bay]" (Joppien and Smith 1988:65) but, by 1821, a thick forest was noted by Tyerman and Bennet (Montgomery 1831:110). MA OHI SOCIETY Protohistoric Ma'ohi society was stratified and complex (Oliver 1974:749). The ari % the ra 'atira, and the manahune were three well-developed social classes (G?rard 1974b:220); ascription to each class was by birth. Ari'i members belonged to the superior class, holding political and ceremonial authority over islands, island divisions, and districts. Mana, an inherited quality, was a special religious force sanctifying the elite. It endowed the chiefs with "effective command over the goods and services of people, including war-making and periodic levies of objects and labor" (Oliver 1989:121). The ra'atira included economic leaders at the district and sub district level (G?rard 1974b:218). The third class, the manahune, consisted of commoners; some manahune were landless individuals, servants, prison ers, and slaves (Oliver 1974:765-9). In addition, Ma'ohi belonged to other social units such as "descent lines, kin-congregations, marriage classes, guilds, tribes, and less secular cults and sects" (Oliver 1974:65). Marae constructed of coral and basalt were sacred meeting-places for interacting with spirit tutelaries (Oliver 1989:118) and symbolised the basic</page><page sequence="5">Simple Marae of the 'Opunaohu Valley 191 rights of a Ma'ohi group (Henry 1928:131-48). Founded on genealogies, marae antiquity determined a person's social position (Baessler 1900:119). As such, they provided the supernatural legitimation for a group's rank and property (G?rard 1978:407). Henry (1928:143) describes the sanctity of marae: [g]reat care was taken not to remove stones from strange lands, extending even to the sea shoals, without the special permission of the owners, and also not to violate the sanctity of old marae sites by taking any of their stray stones. Death by the hands of the proprietors, especially if they were of high rank, was considered the legitimate penalty for such transgression. Rodriguez, a Spanish missionary who visited Mo'orea between 1772 and 1776, also noted the sanctity of marae and the Tahitian reluctance to disturb such sites: ... on our wishing to make use, for the steps, of certain trimmed stones that formed part of the marae or temple in which the arii are sworn in which place is called Guayotaha, the lady refused to allow it, saying she would be in dread of some punishment or other from her Divinity, for such irreverence as to concede anything whatever from the temple in question. We overrode all that, however, without paying any heed to the spectacle of her distress, and so we made good our purpose. As a result of this she directed that we be told that she dared not cross our threshold by stepping on those stones, lest her god or Teatua should destroy her (Corney 1919:66). OPUNOHU VALLEY SETTLEMENT HISTORY MODEL A chronological context for the valley is constructed from primary and secondary sources. Descantes (1990:177-83) contains a list of chronological events in the Opunohu reconstructed from oral traditions (e.g., Adams 1947; Henry 1928) and European observations (e.g., Beaglehole 1967). The identification of ethnohistorically documented sociopolitical transitions and their possible archaeological correlates divides the final period of Tahitian occupation into three culture historical phases: Atiro'o (7-1650), Marama (1650-1788), and Pomare (1788-1843). Developing a firm ethnographic and historical foundation for these phases during early contact in Ma Ohi culture leads to better interpretations of earlier cultural proc?s ses. Green ' s ( 1967:126) proviso that Polynesian cultures had already been changed by European influences when descriptions of them were written is not a serious problem because the surface structures in the Opunohu were used at or just before the time of culture contact. Much of the contextual information on Ma'ohi culture was collected during the Protohistoric and shortly thereafter.</page><page sequence="6">192 Christophe Descantes The Protohistoric interval in the Ma Ohi history has the richest ethnohistoric and ethnographic materials obtained from oral traditions and European observations. Valley occupation reached its climax during the Protohistoric (Green 1967:118) which, in Mo'orea, is believed to date between European contact with Captain Cook on September 30, 1777 (Beaglehole 1967:225), and the establishment of a London Missionary Society settlement at Papeto ' ai, near the head of the Opunohu Valley in 1812 (Newbury 1961:235). Atiro'o {7-1650) The culture historical narrative of the inland Opunohu Valley begins with the Atiro'o occupation as recorded in the traditional history of Ari'i Taimai (Adams 1947:163-4). Valley occupation may have begun earlier (Lepofsky et al 1992), but known surface Ma'ohi settlements in the Opunohu belong to the Late Prehistoric or the Protohistoric period of the 18th and early 19th century. Finding a starting point for the Atiro phase is problematic because of limited ethnohistoric and archaeological information. I use the date of AD 1650 as recorded by Ari'i Taimai (Adams 1947:163-4) to mark the end of the Atiro phase in the Opunohu (Greener al 1967:220). According to legend, the Atiro'o were a Tahitian clan who settled in the Opunohu and other parts of Mo'orea. Data on the earliest settlement information of the Opunohu are scarce and uncertain. Green et al (1967:220) stated that adze types, identifiable structures, a number of radiocarbon dates, and the absence of European materials in excavations show sustained occupation in the valley between the 17th and early 19th century, the last phase of Tahitian culture. All but one of the Opunohu radiocarbon dates was analysed at the Gakushuin laboratory. Kirch (1986:23) has suggested that dates from this laboratory may not be reliable. On the basis of surface remains and a calibrated radiocarbon date of A.D. 1259 to 1387 at 2 sigma (Green et al 1967:166; AMNH-204) on charcoal from an oven underlying the wall of a later round-ended house, Amehiti has the oldest known surface occupations in the Opunohu (Stuiver and Reimer 1986). Other material in the lower valley may be more deeply buried (Lepofsky et al 1992). Marama (1650-1788) The second phase takes its name after the Marama family, a Mo 'orean ari 'i family and rivals to the Punuateraitua family, the holders of the most important marae on Mo'orea ? Nu'urua. According to Adams (1947:167), the Marama residing at Ha'apiti conquered the Atiro'o and divided the valley into Amehiti and Tupaururu and made new settlements in Tupaururu. Handy (1930:80, Figure 4) places Tupaururu in the Paopao Valley, but the Tupaururu</page><page sequence="7">Simple Marcie o f the Opunaohu Valley 193 section as defined here is accepted as Marama's residence because of the abundant archaeological evidence (see also Green et al 1967:224). The Marama family resisted European contact, as shown in a song from Marau (Handy 1930:82): Come, oh come to your districts, Tupauruuru and Amehiti, To see the big canoe without an outrigger. Its rowers are fair as white clouds! But Marama, the arii, replied: "No, my children, no, I will not come. Take from me good counsel: Curiosity was ever a bad tempter, Fair clouds and dark clouds can never long agree. We have no better teacher than the storm." Mahine, a member of the sacred Punuateraitua family on Mo'orea, was military chief ofthe Opunohu under Marama of Ha 'apiti (Adams 1947:172; Greene al 1967:224). On April 26,1774, Captain Cook noted the Tahitian political ascendancy struggles and aggressions between Pomare I and Mahine (Beaglehole 1961:387,405). The Mahine subphase (1767-88) is a continua tion of Marama with similar spatial patterns and at this point discernible only because of historical evidence. In 1774, Mahine began resisting aggressions by Pomare I and was forced to seek refuge in the interior of the Opunohu Valley, a pattern well docu mented in the Society Islands. On October 9, 1777, Cook noted Ma'ohi seeking refuge in the interiors on the north-west corner of Mo 'orea. Anderson in the August 30,1777, entry in his Resolution and Discovery voyage (1776 80) journal, was probably referring to the Opunohu people when he wrote, [w]e had enquird at Tiaraboo about the success of that expedition [1774] and were told that it prov'd fruitless, in so far that the inhabitants of Morea had retir'd to the mountains on the approach of the Ta'heiteans and the last returned without effecting what they intended (Beaglehole 1967:977). Pomare (1788-1843) Once Pomare I established himself as paramount chief in 1790, he built many marae to consolidate his dominion and chiefly status. The two districts of Amehiti and Tupaururu were superseded by a new political creation, Te Aharoa (Green et al 1967:224). with seven late subdivisions: ... Hue (Gourd), Tahu-mate, (Invoked-to-death), Pina'i (Echo), Poa (Scale), Hitihiti, (Border), 4A 'araeo (Now-fathom-to-there), and Te-uru-tuia-i-ti-a'u (The-head-pierced-by-the-billfish) (Henry 1928:92). . . .</page><page sequence="8">194 Christophe Descantes Unlike the Marama, the Pomare did not distance themselves from Euro peans. In 1812, Pomare II (Pomare s son) accepted Christianity (Oliver 1974:1336) to consolidate his power and conform to previous patterns of "divine kingship" (Newbury 1967:502). At this time, a Protestant missionary church replaced the taputapuatea or international marae near the head of the Opunohu (see Bar? 1987:161). Only eight years earlier, Pomare II had been invested as the paramount chief at this marae; its replacement symbolised the defeat of the Ma'ohi gods by the new Christian god. With no fewer than 15 missionaries on Mo'orea in 1815, Newbury (1980:37) comments "Mo'orea must have been the most intensively evangelized community in the world". SURVEY AND CLASSIFICATION METHODS The spatial arrangement of the ubiquitous marae served as a source for a re-analysis of 'Opunohu Valley settlement (Descantes 1990). Although excavation data are available for less than 1% (10/1395) of the structures, the 'Opunohu survey data are unique because: i) the archaeological landscape escaped the destruction that occurred in other valleys and was only slightly disturbed at the time of the 1960 survey ; ii) a complete survey of an inland valley system with the complete range in structure variability was provided; iii) specific areas had unique spatial patterns; and iv) as in the interior of the Tautira District (Tahiti) (Garanger 1964:18), a large complex marae, com mon on the coast, was found in the interior of the ' Opunohu (Green 1961 a: 170). Other Society Island valleys were not so lucky, as described in the London Missionary Society Archives on November 17 1815: "Pomare had sent people to destroy the maraes and altars and fetch Oro from Tautira, that he also might undergo the same fate" (Newbury 1961:193). It is the unique preser vation of the Opunohu stone structures that allows for explanations of the architectural and spatial patterns using ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence. I modified Green's (1961a) hierarchical recording method and typology (Green and Descantes 1989) by adding one more specific lower level ? architectural components. The architectural hierarchy of the stone structures is defined on the basis of features and components. Site designations are used only for location purposes. Components, the most discrete architectural units, follow Weisler and Kirch's (1985:131) hierarchical structure model. For example, a round-ended habitation feature comprises four architectural components: a kerbstone outline, a terrace, and interior and exterior pave ments. Green's (1961a) original classification contained 25 Opunohu stone structure types. I(Descantes 1991:110) added nine more types: three marae,</page><page sequence="9">Simple Marcie of the Opunaohu Valley 195 three tVi (see Mead n.d.), terraces, stone alignments, and natural or referent structures. Green's (1961a:131) living flats type was not used. References to types hereafter are to my own (Descantes 1990, 1991). types. I analysed marae as diverse combinations of 15 religious elements: extremity ahu, interior ahu, stepped ahu, coral stones, cysts, dressed stones, enclosing walls, paepae, pavements, three ti'i types, coral and banded veneers, and uprights (Descantes 1991:116-8). Marae with two or three religious elements but no ahu are characterised as simple; marae with more than three elements and an ahu are complex. ELEMENTS CHARACTERISTICS Ahu stone platform at one end of marae Stepped ahu ahu containing steps Extremity ahu located at the boundary of marae Interior ahu slightly in from the marae boundaries Ahu veneer stone facing against the front of the ahu Banded veneer alternating coral and basalt slabs Coral veneer coral slabs only Coral stones found within the precincts of the marae Cyst enclosed depressions Dressed stones round-shaped stones Enclosing walls unconsolidated boundary walls of marae Paepae raised paved platforms Pavement hard surface TVi small anthropomorphic statuettes; three types Uprights vertical stones in marae courtyard Table 1. Religious elements. I suggest that three simple marae types: Ilii, Ilik, and IXa, correspond to the household unit. Type lili marae include an enclosing wall, a pavement, and uprights (Fig. 2). Type Ilik marae and IXa shrines are morphologically identical, comprising a pavement, and uprights, but type Ilik marae are usually larger than shrines (see Descantes 1991:122). Shrines, the most numerous religious venues in the Opunohu, are miniature marae (see Emory</page><page sequence="10">196 Christophe Descantes 1000 Coastal plains Amehiti Middle Tupaururu Environmental sections 1 Lower valley I 1 Upper valley Figure 2. Simple Opunohu type Uli marae with ti ' ' (photo Erwin Christian). 1970:74) and are also included as simple marae. Green et al. (1967:141) defined a shrine "as a rectangular and unenclosed pavement, its longest dimension in general less than 20 feet [6.1 m] and bearing at least three uprights at one end of the pavement and a backrest in the midline at the opposite end". In Descantes (1990,1991), an unenclosed paved structure need only have at least one upright to be identified as a shrine or a simple marae. I distinguish shrines and simple marae by the relative size of simple marae to marae in their proximity. A simple marae appended to a large marae needs to be larger than shrines elsewhere before being classified as a type Ilik marae. Hereafter, shrines are referred to as simple marae. Marae appendages are stone religious structures physically attached to marae (G?rard 1978:421), and include the simple marae. There also can be nonreligious marae appendages, but these are not discussed in this article. G?rard' s second type of annexed or appended marae is split into two groups for the Opunohu; the first consists of marae with flanking appendages on their long side, termed "lateral" (Fig. 3) and the second is made up of marae with additions on their short side, termed "linear" (Fig. 4). This pattern is subdivided even further where more than one simple marae are appended to each other and the larger marae (Fig. 6).</page><page sequence="11">Simple Marae of the Opunaohu Valley 197 Figure 4. "Linear" pattern structures 0-124o and 0-124k (Green and Descantes 1989:205).</page><page sequence="12">198 Christophe Descantes SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF STONE STRUCTURES Stone structure spatial distributions differ both within and between the environmental sections. The highest structure density and most (60.7%) of the stone structures are located in Tupaururu, beginning about 3 km inland. Structures in Amehiti begin approximately 1.5 km inland with more struc tures in the lower zone than the same zone of the Middle and Tupaururu sections. Ninety-nine (98.7%) per cent of the structures in Tupaururu are in the upper zone (Fig. 5). There is a paucity of structures in the Middle section. Settlement density in the Middle section is conspicuously low and clusters there are small and widely spaced. The Coastal plains section is devoid of surface archaeological stone structures except for four pavements. This section undoubtedly once had stone structures based on all the contextual sources, and my own explanation for their absence is site destruction in this easily accessible area. Figure 5. Structure counts in the valley sections and zones.</page><page sequence="13">Simple Mame of the Opunaohu Valley 199 The settlements in the upper reaches of Tupaururu, comprising 61 per cent of the recorded Opunohu structures, make identification of settlement clusters difficult because of the high density of structures. The structural density in the Tupaururu settlement space is approximately 3.5 times greater than that in Amehiti. Amehiti, on the other hand, has widely spaced stone structures, and habitations surround simple marae or shrines in continuous aggregates of settlements. Amehiti stone structures occur in both small and large linear clusters which follow streams, but in no definite pattern as one moves towards the interior. Of the 33 structure types defined by my self (Descantes 1991), 12arefound only in Tupaururu and one is found solely in Amehiti. The unique Amehiti structure is an a/zw-bearing marae. In Tupaururu are found nine other types of a/zw-bearing marae and three other structure types believed to be associated with elite or high-ranking religious activities: large paepae, archery plat forms, and one type of ti 7. The Middle section has too few structures to make reliable statements and, possibly due to the less formal nature of the survey in both the Middle and Amehiti sections, spatial patterns are less certain. All but one of the 65 structures recorded in the Middle section are adjacent to the ridge separating the Middle and Tupaururu sections. Unlike Amehiti and Tupaururu, no unique structure types are found in the Middle section. The Middle section archaeological remains, geographically juxtaposed to those of Tupaururu, are more similar to Tupaururu than to Amehiti. Although there are similar numbers of habitational or activity structures in Amehiti and Tupaururu, there are far more elite and religious structures in Tupaururu. Though the Middle and Tupaururu sections are physically separated by a ridge, settlements in both sides may well have been occupied by one social unit (Green 1967:112; Green et al. 1967:221) because there also are no known boundary walls between the two sections. The most variable structures in the Opunohu Valley were the 214 recorded marae which originate from distinct historical and sociocultural contexts (Descantes 1990:98). Apart from providing "special clues to the development and spread of Polynesian culture" (Emory 1970:91), marae were an important component in the symbolic field. Five marae architectural elements are found only in the upper reaches of the Tupaururu section. They are stepped ahu, extreme ahu, cysts, and coral and banded veneers. All of the other religious elements, except enclosing walls, pavements, and uprights, occur only once or twice in the Amehiti and Middle sections. The only marae in Amehiti with a possible late religious element is structure 0-15h, which has dressed stones and is located at the bottom of the valley. The temporal sequence of these religious elements is uncertain, but some elements of</page><page sequence="14">200 Christophe Descantes Opunohu marae are known to be later than others (Green and Green 1968) from other regional Society Island contexts. SIMPLE MARAE Simple marae are the most numerous type (n=168/214, 79%) in the Opunohu. There are 26 type Ilii marae, 32 type Ilik, and 110 type IXa shrines found in the Opunohu. Of the 168 simple marae in the Opunohu, 94 (55%) are not appended to other religious structures or are more than 5 m from another religious structure. Seventy-four simple marae (44%) belong in marae complexes. Nine simple marae are appended to simple marae appended to larger, unique or more complex marae; eight of these marae are located in Tupaururu. Some large complex a/?w-bearing marae have no simple marae appendages; of the 41 a/zw-bearing marae in the Opunohu, 11 Figure 6. 1989:209), Structures 0-128a, b, and c from Tupaururu (Green and Descantes</page><page sequence="15">Simple Mame of the Opunaohu Valley 201 (27%) do not have appendages. All are found in high-density structure areas, except for one isolated specimen in the Middle and Amehiti sections. Two specimens have possible simple marae as their nearest neighbour types. Even though three types have been grouped together in the simple marae category, their spatial characteristics in the valley imply differences in meaning and function. For the following presentation of data, simple marae are split into two groups, with the morphologically similar types IXa and Ilik forming group and type Uli forming group I.

Distribution of simple marae. The range of sizes for groups I and simple marae in the three sections is similar. After t-tests, group I simple marae are found statistically larger than group simple marae within each section and in the entire valley. The number of uprights in both groups between types, valley sections, and the entire valley are similar. Uprights were special stones, often made of columnar basalt, placed vertically in the marae court. Emory (1933:16-7) states they could be leaning posts for priests, backrests for high-ranking persons, resting places for visiting spirits, or memorial stones for departed chiefs. The average number of uprights in the valley for group I is 3.2 and for group is 3.4. There is no relationship between the size of the simple marae and the corresponding number of uprights. There is variation in marae sizes for simple marae containing the same number of uprights, the most frequent number of uprights on simple marae being 1 for group I simple marae (n=7) and 2 (n=46) for group simple marae. Spatial patterns in Tupaururu are the most conspicuous with small simple marae appended against already existing unique and complex marae in the upper valley settlements. Most of the Tupaururu simple marae are either juxtaposed or less than 5 m away from the other religious structure. The</page><page sequence="16">202 Christophe Descantes structural complexity and density of Tupaururu settlements are the highest in the entire valley. No structures were recorded in the lower zone of Tupaururu. Two areas in Amehiti exhibit spatial patterns similar to those found in Tupaururu. The first is the large unappended a/iw-bearing marae 0-15h (Green and Descantes 1989:24, 150, 256) with a pavement, an interior ahu, dressed stones, and uprights, located at the bottom of the Amehiti section. It is the most complex marae in Amehiti and the only one of its type in the Opunohu Valley. The surrounding area has an uncharacteristically high structure density for Amehiti as well as structures of importance in close proximity, including round-ended habitations and paepae. The second pattern involves the area surrounding site 0-74 (Green and Descantes 1989:60-1, 175, 259) in the upper settlements of Amehiti. Like Tupaururu, it may have small marae appendages surrounding a larger marae and a high structure density in the immediate area. From spatial arrangements alone, both patterns are interpreted as being similar to those of Tupaururu, and possibly contemporaneous with late Tupaururu stone structures. Further excavations of the structures within these spatial clusters could test this. There are three marae complexes in the Amehiti section. One has both a linear and lateral pavement appendage; the second complex, a type Ilik marae, has a lateral pavement appendage; and the third complex, also a type Ilik marae, has one linear shrine and two other possible simple marae appendages. These three complexes are an exception to the general Amehiti spatial pattern, comprising structures like those of Tupaururu, where simple marae appendages prevail. The Middle section has one marae complex with a linear appended pavement. All the marae appendages in Tupaururu are lateral, except for those of two structures. Religious affiliations of some stone enclosures are shown by their strong association with simple marae. Enclosures are associated with larger and more numerous religious-type structures than in the Middle and Amehiti sections. Of particular significance is site 0-182 which has eight enclosures, possibly for keeping pigs, appended to a simple marae in the most complex marae area of the valley. Agricultural terraces have no significant complex religious associations, that is, with structures consisting of more than three religious elements, and also do not seem to be associated with simple marae. However, agricultural terraces were not thoroughly recorded. G?rard (1974a:71) and Emory (1979:218) note that ti 'i are usually located on simple marae. Eleven Opunohu stone ti 7 are located on or next to small simple marae. Ti (i are not associated with agricultural terraces or enclosures, and their distribution and association on simple marae in the Opunohu system suggest a function of marking boundaries (see Henry 1928:173). De</page><page sequence="17">Simple Marae of the 'Opunaohu Valley 203 Bovis (1976:57) notes the jurisdiction of many ti 'i did not extend beyond the property of a household or cluster of households. DISCUSSION The built environment of the valley, including unused areas, structured the lives of the last 'Opunohu inhabitants. I use the structural remains and ethnographic and historical information to explain late social practice of the Opunohu peoples and search for archaeological correlates in the architecture of the stone remains to interpret late political transitions in the valley. Simple marae are a valuable medium for the detection of sociocultural behavioural patterns in the archaeological spatial data. They are interpreted to be the religious components of households and were used in attempts to ensure the success of familial enterprises, such as the growing of crops or the keeping of pigs. After terraces and pavements, simple marae are the most numerous stone structures in the valley, and appear to be associated with households and their activities. Moerenhout noted [my translation, emphasis added], "Marais, although much smaller, were built in the same way [as previously mentioned larger marae], and so numerous that they were found in all directions in island interiors and near dwellings" (1837:469). I attempt to identify households from the other direction, that is, from identifying simple marae rather than habitation remains. The household ( 'utuafare ) was the smallest social and residential unit in a hierarchy of ranked levels (Oliver 1974:996-8) where each traced descent from a common ancestor. Oliver (1974:44) notes: [t]he early European visitors to the Islands found the indigenes dwelling in "households" scattered mainly about the coastal plain and the lower and middle reaches of the valleys. Such households typically consisted of a single sleeping house along with a separate cookhouse, although a few also included an extra shelter or two for sleeping, working, or entertaining. In addition, in many if not most cases the structures making up a household unit included a marae, a place set aside and specially constructed for worship. Nearly all these households were separated from one another by gardens and orchards. Some stood hundreds of yards distant from all other dwellings; but most individual households were clustered, spatially and socially, into "neighborhoods" consisting of from two to ten or so households [emphasis added]. Every household is assumed to have had a religious component? a simple marae, the focal point of household activities. Preservante simple marae identify households. In a preliminary archaeological definition of households</page><page sequence="18">204 Christophe Descantes for Mata'ire 'a Hill in Maeva village on Huahine, Sinoto ( 1989:2) confirms the recurrent household spatial pattern where "[e]ach unit consisted of a marae, a habitation platform including a cooking house platform nearby, and agricul tural terraces on both the upper and lower slopes of the unit". The household site includes residential, agricultural, food processing, and religious com ponents. In the Opunohu, not all the simple marae are associated with houses, perhaps owingto the low archaeological visibility of kerbstones that identify a habitation. Many simple marae have appended enclosures and pavements some of which may, at one time, have been simple marae but which now have their stone uprights dislodged. Discussions of archaeological marae suffer from not knowing the many unpresentable objects that existed on them. Other simple marae, misinter preted archaeologically as simple pavements, are those which once had only unu, wooden boards hung with feathers and strips of tapa and matting (Oliver 1974:101), but no stone uprights. Such a marae or shrine is visible in Tobin's 1792 watercolour "The Marae at Pare, Island of Tahiti, Looking Toward Matavai" reproduced in Green and Green (1968:87, Fig. III). The presence of four wooden ti in a funeral cave at the foot of Mount Rotui in the Opunohu Bay (Charleux 1980:130) is further evidence of a preservation bias against wood in the valley. Alternatively, other simple marae associations may be those of household activities. Most Tahitian activities occurred outside living areas, instead of within walled houses (Orliac 1982:44-5). Wet conditions in the 'Opunohu required the building of pavements for activity areas. Some household activities ? food production, the keeping of pigs, and craft specialisations (e.g., the making of tapa cloth) ? which could take place on structures such as terraces, enclosures, and pavements may be associated with simple marae. Adams (1947:97) comments that, after an Attahooroo descent in 1782 on Pare in Tahiti, all the houses and property had been destroyed or carried away, and even in 1788 the people had no other habitations than light sheds which might be taken by the four corners and removed by four men. It follows that all Opunohu habitations may not have had stone kerbstones. The simple marae not associated with houses suggest that corresponding houses to appended simple marae may have been spatially removed from the marae or that these marae possibly had other functions. It is suggested that appended simple marae indicate household structures, possibly those of junior lines. It is apparent from the general symbolic map</page><page sequence="19">Simple Marae of the 'Opunaohu Valley 205 of the features (Descantes 1990:163-75) that most marae complexes have small simple marae appendages. This is also true in the Manina Valley on Tahiti (V?rin 1964:27). In the Opunohu it is not architecturally conceivable that the large complex marae were built after the smaller simple structures were appended, especially when a marae has more than one smaller append age, and I assume that most of the additions were made while the large complex marae were still functioning. Support for the view that simple appended marae were related to house hold marae of ancestral households may be evidenced by the two archery platforms and simple marae on the sides of a complex interior aAw-bearing Figure 7. Photograph of marae Afareaitu with two simple marae.</page><page sequence="20">206 Christophe Descantes marae with a cyst, a banded veneer, and an enclosing wall in Tupaururu (Fig. 8). Each archery platform corresponds to a small simple marae in association with the large and complex parental marae. As each household required a simple marae, the two higher-ranked households of marae 0-161b also commanded their respective archery platform. Though one archery platform is larger than the other, both simple marae are very close in size; one is appended, the other is less than a metre away. Another possible example of accommodating a junior line is the late construction of the Nu'urua marae at Varari, a copy, which was constructed to avoid a conflict between two collateral lines on Mo'orea (G?rard 1974a:71). The remaining archery platform in the Opunohu is also associated with the same type of marae and a simple marae. There are similarities and differences between the simple marae. The salient differences are in morphology, size, and spatial arrangement. Group I simple marae, with an extra enclosing wall, tend to be larger and not appended to marae, whereas group simple marae tend to be smaller and appended to other marae.

RAMAGE FISSIONING For the Society Islands, Sahlins (1958:165) notes: [e]ach family had a temple. The largest temple in a district, that of the senior family was considered the parent temple from which the others branched off. There was an institutionalized method by which temples segmented which illustrates the growth of ramages by fission. This quotation concerns national marae, and I use it solely to support the idea of ramage fissioning. The institutionalised method of Polynesian ramage fissioning would produce a widespread distribution of household marae comparable to the simple marae distribution found in Amehiti. Oliver (1989:119) states that, as neighborhoods proliferated, additional residences were built at considerable distances from the parent stock to establish new land titles. It was usually up to the junior lines to move out and find new land, the senior lines receiving the land and titles. After some generations, a kin-congregation would be widespread, each household with its own marae. A large marae complex is presumed to demarcate a kin-congregation (Oliver 1974:625). In Tupaururu, I believe the institutionalised method of Polynesian ramage fissioning is evidenced by the addition of simple marae to large or complex parental marae. Compared with the much greater number of religious structures in Tupaururu, the spatial patterns of Amehiti could result from either an earlier abandonment or contemporaneous sets of lower-ranked groups residing in most of Amehiti (Green et al. 1967:224-6). Large unsettled areas in the Middle section and the bottom of Tupaururu were ecologically viable areas to accommodate fissioning groups of people for a "distant" spatial pattern similar to that of most of Amehiti. By contrast, settlements were concentrated in the back of the Tupaururu section of the Opunohu landscape where people chose to construct their marae close to one another. The spatial patterns of Amehiti typify segmenting social groups as stated by Oliver (1989:119) and Sahlins (1958:165) in "distant" interhousehold spatial patterns. The "clustered" interhousehold spatial patterns of Tupaururu may represent household marae appended to larger marae as ramages fissioned and resisted both the aggressions of peoples on the coast and the European presence. Instead of strict cannibalising of older marae (Oliver 1974:188), it is proposed that new marae were annexed to pre-existing ones</page><page sequence="22">208 Christophe Descantes in the Opunohu. If large t///m-bearing marae with simple marae appendages demarcate the parental stock of the kin-congregation heads, smaller appended marae may represent distinct collateral lines, in consanguinial or fictional relations with the most senior living member of the large marae. With the establishment of a missionary station at the head of the Opunohu in 1812, Ma'ohi religion, social authority and status were refuted by the proselytising missionaries. Families continued to segment but, instead of moving away, amalgamated with prominent families to strengthen opposition to the com mon threat of the new influences, A display of strong sanctified households sustained rank and class against new usurpers of political power. Marae without simple marae appendages are distinctive and complex, most being made up of more than five religious elements. For example, some marae are very big, and contain a stepped a lui or are constructed of dressed stones. Others have distinctive nearest neighbours, such as archery platforms, Figure 9. Symbolised illustration (not to scale) of the typical Tupaururu spatial pattern of some site 0-124 features.</page><page sequence="23">Simple Marae of the Opunaohu Valley 209 paepae or round-ended houses. Consistent patterns in religious elements or types of nearest neighbours are not found for these marae. It is possible that these marae were the highest-ranking structures of the valley. Many coastal marae, at Mata'irea Hill, Maeva, Huahine, for example, have close associa tions with pavements and simple marae, but structures attached to large marae have, to my knowledge, not yet been found. If simple marae represent households, then large complex marae without associated simple marae may suggest that their owners chose to separate or that they had high status with no closely ranked secondary or junior line affiliates. The divine mandate of these marae owners is grounded on genealogies, and not necessarily with affiliated households. They may represent the efforts of Pomare, before Christian conversion, to mark his claim to the Opunohu. The Oro cult influenced the architecture of religious structures in the Opunohu. Oro, a creation of Ta'aroa was, among other things, the god of war and human sacrifice. The 'Arioi society had its origin in the mysteries attributed to 'Oro (Oliver 1974:57). The ideological affiliation of the group provided the divine sanctions for social aggrandisement. Men and women from the several social classes made up the highly esteemed 'Arioi society. The date of origin of the 'Oro cult is not known, but Mahine was a member of the special 'Oro-founded 'Arioi society. The Pomare, successors to the Marama in the Opunohu, also claimed patronage from Oro (see Newbury 1967:503; Oliver 1974:1253). Though Newbury (1967:480) mentions only national marae as centres for "religious-aristocratic fraternities", it is suggested that 'Oro religious ele ments affected other religious structures in the Opunohu. Describing national marae, Henry ( 1928:132) states that Oro marae stones were shaped like turtle's heads, set at regular distances along the sides of the construction. Dressed stones and stepped ahu may originate from the 'Oro cult. Green et al. (1967:160-1) imply that structure 0-129a, which has a stepped interior ahu with a coral veneer, a paepae, dressed stones, a pavement, and uprights, is from the late-18th century and associated with ari'i and ra'atira ranks of ancient Tahitian society (see also Green and Green 1968:88). Dressed stones may symbolise sacred turtles and signify the late 'Oro cult. SOCIOPOLITICAL TRANSITIONS Archaeological evidence of the Atiro'o is uncertain. If Amehiti is indeed the oldest settled valley section in the Opunohu, it can be characterised by low structure density and architecturally simple structures. However, settle ment was nonintensive according to archaeological evidence. It is unlikely that settlement in Amehiti stopped after this initial occupation. Settlement evidence in Tupaururu for large complex marae begins in the Marama phase.</page><page sequence="24">210 Christophe Descantes The characteristic spatial pattern of large marae complexes at the very back of this section, many with simple appended marae, probably continued until the end of the Mahine subphase. After conquering the Atiro , the Marama settled in the Opunohu, most notably in Tupaururu. It is suggested that, as Marama and their followers retreated from the coast to the interior of the Opunohu Valley, particularly during the turbulent Mahine subphase, amalgamation with existing Marama marae would be accommodated, as evidenced by large marae complexes and their attached simple marae. Ellis notes (1972:219-20) the use of coral pebbles for the rededication of marae (G?rard 1974a:97). In the Opunohu, seven (17%) of the 41 a/zw-bearing marae have coral pebbles, evidence for possible marae rededication and the accommodation of new populations in the Opunohu. G?rard (1974a:71) uses the construction of the impressive Mahaiatea marae, built for Teri'ierere, the eldest son of Amo and Purea, as an example of arVi families enlarging and building new marae in the transformational and competitive times of the Protohistoric period (1974a:71). This late coastal practice also may have occurred in the Opunohu Valley interior as exemplified by the imposing complex of Tupaururu, and may explain the anomalous presence of 0-129a, a stepped ahu marae with dressed stones in the interior of the Opunohu. The deep valley of the Opunohu is interpreted as a retreat for those resisting the European intrusion and its unwelcome cultural impacts. Opunohu inhabitants, and other communities like them, had the enormous task of maintaining their diminishing status quo. They retreated to new social environments where they could overtly affirm the centuries-old religious prerogatives of their political and social positions. Opunohu arVi provided protection for people in the internecine warfare which occurred frequently in the Society Islands. The ethnohistoric record provides numerous instances in which Opunohu inhabitants resisted the attacks of other chiefs (Adams 1947:5; Beaglehole 1967:197; Oliver 1974:1246), as part of the war of succession that occurred on Mo'orea in the late 18th and 19th centuries (Oliver 1974:1249, 1257). Interior valleys offered protection for defeated groups, as Tyerman and Bennet note, Pomare's conquering bands were eager to pursue the fugitives and complete the victory, though they disavowed the purpose of destroying them. The king, however, interfered, and said, in a style of oriental magnificence, "The mountains are mine: follow not the vanquished thither! The motus are mine: let them alone there also. Proceed only along the open ways. Take no lives:</page><page sequence="25">Simple Marae of the Opunaohu Valley 211 take nothing but the spoils which you find in the field or on the roads" (Montgomery 1831:1:160). Marae in the valley also may have provided refuge for fugitives in general (Oliver 1974:105); as Turnbull (1813:366) explains, "they fly to them when in any imminent danger, and, according to the custom of the country, must not be taken from thence". It is suggested that, sometime before Pomare' s 1774 attack on the Opunohu, high-ranking people began to seek refuge in the Tupaururu section. On October 9 and 10 of 1777 Opunohu inhabitants also endured the rage of Captain Cook, who burned their houses and canoes after a suspected goat theft (Beaglehole 1967:229-32). These and other events on the coast caused the people to take permanent refuge in the valley. Opunohu inhabitants not only resisted attacks, but also participated in attacks, like the one in 1788 on Pare, where Mahine died (Oliver 1974:1252, 1367). In August of 1789, the Swedish brig Mercury also witnessed a brief skirmish at Opunohu Bay in the continuation of the war of succession on Mo'orea. Adams (1947:107) comments that Pomare's ambition for the Opunohu was also advanced in 1790 with help from some of the Bounty mutineers. Missionary presence in 1805 and the later erection of a missionary station at Papeto'ai initially caused more people to seek refuge in the interiors of the Opunohu Valley (see Montgomery 1831:142). In proselytising the people, the missionaries repudiated the indigenous religion and questioned the political and social foundation of Ma'ohi society. On February 4, 1805, Bicknell and Henry (1805:14) noted: [w]e saw in many places round the island the ruins of houses that had been burnt down in the late war + several houses whose inhabitants we were informed had fled to Taheite [Tahiti] for refuge: it is probable to the Attahooroaoans [in the district of Atehuru]. In 1813, Davies made a trip around Mo'orea and noted," [s]uperstition and regard for the gods seemed to be decreasing and the maraes and altars out of repair every where ..." (Newbury 1961:195). Between 1805 and 1815, the Opunohu gradually emptied of human occupants (Green et al 1967:222-3) as European diseases devastated the Ma'ohi and the traditional social system disintegrated. Enforcing religious sanctions to legitimate the old social order of the Opunohu may have become peremptory as the population declined and political relations changed. The status of high-ranking peoples in the Opunohu was no longer compatible with actual social practice in the valley, since Ma4ohi religion no longer</page><page sequence="26">212 Christophe Descantes determined status as people died or moved to the coasts. The Opunohu fell silent as activities and social life concentrated on the coasts, and the valley was used only intermittently as an area for cultivation and grazing. The abandon ment of the Opunohu Valley protected the stone structures, most notably the marae, from destruction after Christianity took hold. The Ma'ohi cosmological system granted the arVi a self-evident legiti macy (see Touraine 1977:462). The spatial structure of the built environment is a reflection of the Opunohu cognitive system and social practices, and was actively involved in the formation and structuring of these practices (see Shanks and Tilley 1987:85). Claiming "divine authorization", Opunohu elites naturalised the social order (see Giddens 1979:195), making social inequalities seem immutable, as evidenced by the size and complexity of some Tupaururu marae. While maintaining political and ritual prerogatives, Opunohu elites at the same time also had to quell opposition from lower-ranked people. Newbury (1967:492) notes, "[t]he more immediate difficulty after 1807 was not how to validate rank in religious terms, but to control mounting opposition from lower social orders". More access to religious symbols for people of lower rank ensured their loyalty to the elite, which may explain the increase in possible size, complexity, and simple possible appendages in Tupaururu. To reinforce the symbolic meanings of the stone structures, spatial patterns were repeated, as possibly evidenced by the conformity in size of simple possible marae appendages. CONCLUSIONS During the eventful Protohistoric, the Opunohu Valley appears to have served as a refuge for people resisting internecine warfare and European contact. Marae, the most conspicuous and variable structures of the Opunohu cultural landscape, served to denote sociopolitical power relations. The chronological phases exhibit particular effects of sociopolitical change as evidenced in architectural and spatial pattern trends of Opunohu areas. Religious edifices ritually legitimised the political authority of the ari'i (G?rard 1974b:217) and the social structure of Ma Ohi society. They were the most powerful symbols manipulated in affecting the social relations of the Ma'ohi society in the Opunohu Valley. In the Protohistoric period in the Opunohu, the stone symbols provided a permanent medium through which to overtly reaffirm Ma'ohi political authority and continue the pattern of power relations (see Bourdieu 1977:89). Numerous political transitions occurred in the Opunohu (e.g., see Adams 1947:167; Green et al 1967:221). Some trends in the spatial patterns reflect these transitions. When taking possession of new land or when one wanted</page><page sequence="27">Simple Marae of the 'Opunaohu Valley 213 to separate one's line from the principal (ati, a marae was erected (Henry 1928:142). In the Society Islands "every marae was an offshoot of an earlier one, forming a continuity, substantialized in the founding stone" (Oliver 1974:190). An appended marae could mark the distinctiveness of social or household units by being separate units attached to a parental marae. The practice of appending one marae to an older one could also satisfy the need of ancestral authorisation, precluding the need of taking a stone of an older ancestral marae to found a new one. Fissioned junior lines may have remained in close association with the ancestral stock and all its old religious affiliates to oppose the common European threat to their political prerogatives by staying localised and strengthening the solidarity of the group. The excerpt of "Chant on a Marae" from the priests Tamera and Pati'i collected by Orsmond (Henry 1928:151) and quoted at the beginning of this paper exemplifies the protection offered by the house or marae of a great person. Close association with a common ancestor increased the mana of a household, and declared legitimate claim to land and status through affinity with the genealogical history of the group. In return, the higher-ranking class received the loyalty of the retinue, crucial for resisting aggression from other challenging districts and the societal upheav als induced by the European visitors. The increased practice of appending simple marae reinforced the mean ings of the stone structures. I think the symbolic message was that every household had its hierarchical place in the social order of the Opunohu as proscribed by the Ma'ohi gods. Paradoxically, as the symbolic messages amplified, their success weakened, the dwindling population eventually abandoning the valley.
