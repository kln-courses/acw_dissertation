Saptadvipä Vasumati: the mythical geography of the Hindus Jai Pal Singh1 and Mumtaz Khan2 1 Former Head, Department of Geography, Government Arts College, Alwar, Rajasthan, India; 2 Reader in Geography, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India Received 1 September 1998; accepted in revised form: 5 April 1999 Key words: Jambü-Dvipa, Meru, mythical geography, Purãnas, Saptadvïpa Vasumatï Abstract This article attempts to analyse the schema, design and characteristics of the mythical geography of the Hindus. Hindu cosmological speculations have attained their pinnacle in the Purãnas, which dwell on, among other things, the universe in space and time. Purãnic writers created through the symbol of myth a matchless system of continents and oceans, mountains and rivers, lakes and forests. Instead of identifying the fictive continents and oceans with the real world referents, the paper analyses the mythical geography of the Purãnas as a schema, in terms of its own characteristics and purpose. The geography of the Purãnas is symbolic rather than representative, it is rule based, rather than imitative. It seeks to give order to the world and far from reflecting reality, endeavours to create its own reality based on archetypal images and cosmic numbers. Hindu myth makers have transformed unknown physical phantasmagoria into a manageable, meaningful and largely symmetric cosmos. The resulting cosmos is an intricate world of human experience, imagination and fantasy put into one. Introduction Space and place are basic components of the world. Space is essential for our existence. It provides coordinates for our sensory experience. For most of us it is a priori. We take it for granted. Space and place are important for geography. They constitute the existential core of the subject. The nature of space is difficult to comprehend in its en- tirety. Philosophers and scientists have discussed it without arriving at a consensus (Jammer, 1969). For our purpose we may categorize it in the following ways: (i) abstract space, (ii) existential space, (iii) perceptual space (Relph, 1976, pp. 8-22) and (iv) mythical space or the space of imagi- nation (Harvey, 1990, pp. 220-221). Abstract space is the space of philosophers and scientists. They have speculated about it and debated its independent existence. Existential space is the space we live in. It is the container of the em- pirically known world. It is inter- subjective and culturally defined. Perceptual space is the space that we perceive by our sensory motor action for our needs and locomotion in the environment. Mythical space is an imaginary space con- strued by the power of mind by extrapolating far beyond the sense-derived data. Mythical spatialization is not lim- ited to perceptual experience of the environment, it goes far beyond it into the realm of speculation and fantasy. It is an imaginative extension of the known world, a fuzzy area of defective knowledge, often far removed from reality (Tuan, 1977, p. 86). Mythical space has aroused the interest of geographers in recent years. 'Geographers are now interested in how landscapes can be constituted by mythical, magical, and religious beliefs, and how they can be built according to aes- thetic impulses' (Sack, 1989, p. 157). The study of mythical space as a landscape of imagination fits well into the agenda of modern theory informed cultural geography which affirms faith in heterotopia, plurality of cultures and multiplicity of landscapes (Jackson, 1989, pp. 177-180). "Landscape is a way of seeing the world" (Cosgrove, 1984, p. 13). Poten- tially, there are many ways of seeing the world. Mythologists see the world in their own ways. They constitute mythical landscape by mediating through their religious and mystical experiences. Like any other landscape, mythical landscape is an intellectual construct. It, therefore, has every claim to be included in cultural geography. All societies, it may be argued, conceptualize space. They have their own world views or cosmologies. Some cultures have drawn simple, while others have constituted complex schemata, assigning different values to their var- ious components. The Hindu schemata of space are very complex and highly developed. Hindu myth makers have transformed unknown physical phantasmagoria into a man- ageable, meaningful and largely symmetric cosmos. The resulting cosmos is an intricate world of human experience, imagination and fantasy put into one. Hindu cosmology is an integral part of its mythology and is intertwined with re- ligion. It provides meaning to life and a place for humans in the universe, including their orientation to and harmony with the cosmos. Hindu cosmological speculations have attained their pin- nacle in the Purãnas. The Purãnas, ancient encyclopedic texts, dwell on, among other things, the universe in space</page><page sequence="2">270 and time. Purãnic writers created through the symbol of myth, a matchless system of continents and oceans, moun- tains and rivers, lakes and forests. Schemata of mythical geography are given in most of the major Purãnas, albeit with slight variations. Their main features, such as the seven continents and seven oceans, the situation and extent of Meru, the divisions of Jambu-dvïpa and the sub-divisions of Bhãrata are the same in all of them (Wilson, 1961, p. 135 [1]). The Bhãgavata Purãna, however, differs from the Visnu Parana in its nomenclature for the subordinate de- tails. Nevertheless, the similarities are sufficiently great that we shall use the singular 'schema', rather than the plural 'schemata' in the balance of this paper. Aim of the study In this paper an attempt has been made to study the schema, design and characteristics of the mythical geography of the Hindus. Our objective here is neither to find fault with the Purãnic geography nor to engage, as others have done, in a futile search to identify the fictive continents and oceans with the real world referents (Ali, 1966; Buddha Prakash, 1961; Dube, 1967; Gerini, 1909; Iyer, 1924; Krishna- macharlu, 1947; Sircar, 1967; Wilford, 1908), but to analyse it as a schema of mythical geography in terms of its own characteristics and purpose. The study is based mainly on the Visnu Purãna; though the Bhãgavata, Mãrkandeya, Matsya and Vãmana Purãnas were also consulted. The focus of our study is on the Bhuvanakosa section of the Purãnas, which describe the mythical space of Hindus. Buddhist and Jaina cosmologies have been excluded only to avoid the welter of confusing details and not to divert the focus of our attention from our main objective of analysing the Hindu mythical geography per se. Development of the schema of Purãnic geography Indian cosmological speculations are very old. The Baby- lonian influence on its formative stage is debatable. 'But at least from the middle of the first millennium B.C., by which time the Brahmãnda idea had gained currency, Indian cosmological and cosmographie speculation proceeded on a wholly independent course' (Schwartzberg, 1992, p. 334). It seems that Hindu cosmology crystallized in its present form during the Gupta and early medieval periods when the major Purãnas were redacted. The Purãnas tell us that during the Varãha-kalpa, Brahmã, on seeing the earth lay within the waters, took the form of a boar to raise it up. Having adopted the form of varãha (boar), he plunged into the ocean and uplifted upon his tusks the earth from the lowest region for the habitation of all living beings. He then leveled the earth and divided it by mountains into seven continents (Wilson, 1961, p. 29). The raising of the earth from beneath the ocean may be a simple allegory for the imported myth of the extrication of the earth from the great deluge. Figure 1. Hindu cosmological speculations have undergone signif- icant and profound changes from a simple four-continent earth in its initial stage to a complex seven-continent earth in a later stage. Sircar recognizes two main periods in the development of Hindu cosmology. An earlier period is rep- resented by the older Purãnas and early Pali works of the Buddhists, where the world was divided into four continents centered on Mount Meru (Figure 1). The four continents were arranged in cardinal directions like the petals of lotus of which Meru formed the pericarp (Sircar, 1967, p. 40). The chaturdvTpã vasumatï (four-continent earth) concept of the earth was the product of early Brãhmanic Hinduism and Buddhism (Schwartzberg, 1992, p. 335). The later period in the development of Hindu cosmology is represented in the Bhuvanakosa section of most of the Purãnas, wherein the world is divided (Figure 2) into seven ring-shaped concentric continents and seven circumambient oceans (Sircar, 1967, p. 47), The sections on geography and cosmology in the Purãnas were mostly finalized about the 4th century A.D. (Sircar, 1967, p. 38). The transfor- mation of the chaturdvTpã geography to the saptadvTpä one may be traceable to the Buddhist cosmography wherein, 'Meru is itself in the centre of seven annular mountain ranges, kulãcalas, and obviously these kulãcalas, with seas in between them, become continents themselves in the later system' (Mabbett, 1983, p. 67). It may be pointed out that, 'while the Buddhists were influenced by the early Purãnic conception, they themselves influenced the later ideas of the Purãnas' (Sircar, 1967, p. 48). It will not be out of context to refer briefly to the Purãnic myth of creation which finds illuminating parallel with the transformation of chaturdvTpã into saptadvTpä vasumatT. Brahmã first created vãlakhilya rsis (pigmy sages) but they did not procreate. He then produced four other mind-born rsis (Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanãtana and Sanatakumãra, the</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. four kumaras), but they too did not produce any progeny. These four humaras are the archetypal principles of the four- fold scheme of creation called chatuspada. Finally, Brahma created the seven rsis (Kašyapa, Atri, Bhãradvãja, Visvãmitra, Gautama, Jamadagni and Vašistha), who be- came prajãpatis - the founders of gotras (lineage). This is the seven-fold schema of creation which became so popular with the Purãnic writers that they applied it pervasively. The subdivisions of Jambû-dvïpa, the central component of the saptadvípã vasumatT (seven-continent earth) schema, are a strange admixture of original chaturdvTpã geography and later saptadvípã geography fused into a new schema of nine countries (Agrawala, 1964, p. 27). The four traditional ancient countries lie in the cardinal directions around the pivot Meru - Bhadrãsva-varsa in the east, Ketumãla-varsa in the west, Bhärata-varsa in the south and Uttara-Kuru in the north. Five countries were added by later writers. They placed Ilãvrta-varsa at the centre of the Jambû-dvïpa in be- tween Bhadrãsva and Ketumãla and centered it on Meru. They added Hiranya-varsa and Ramyaka-varsa in the north in between Uttara-Kuru and Ilãvrta. Likewise they added Hari-varsa and Kimpurusa-varsa in the south in between Bhãrata-varsa and Ilãvrta-varsa (Figure 3). Discerning stu- dents of Indian mythology will clearly recognize the four ancient continents on the continent of Jambü arranged in cardinal directions around Meru. This is especially true for the schema of Jambû-dvïpa given in Vãmana Parana where the countries are arranged according to cardinal and intermediate directions (Agrawala, 1964, p. 26). 271 Figure 3. Characteristics of mythical space The geography of the Purãnas, the world view of Hindus, was created for religious purposes. Spatial structure serves to structure people and mythical space provides form and coherence to the religious experiences of humankind. It is constructed for their salvation. The structure of mythi- cal space has a symbolic ordering of its sub-divisions and places. The mythology invests meanings and values to these sub-divisions and places. The whole system is charged with meaning. The mythical space of the Hindus is not empty; it has a solid setting, substance and content that derive from hu- man imagination. The myths concretize the space with those elements such as mountains, rivers, lakes and forests that matter for religious purposes. These landmarks, as domains or repositories of gods and other mythological figures, have great significance for Hindus. Moreover, through these con- crete objects of landscape, the Purãnas assign reality to metaphor, mysticism and fantasy. The mythical space of the Purãnas is finite and enclosed. It has a core wrapped in myth and a periphery variously described as a terrestrial paradise or hell, one in opposi- tion to the other. Its geometric design is circular, modeled on the cosmic chakra (wheel) of the Hindus. It comprises alternating annular rings of land and water and is character- ized by grandeur and vast magnitude. The area of successive rings increasing progressively outwards from the core. It is illusory but secure, disproportionately large in size but essentially symmetrical. Purãnic space is structured by myth which organizes it in neat spatial divisions. These divisions provide specificity</page><page sequence="4">272 to humans in the cosmos. Location confers identity (e.g., the priest locates his jajamãna (patron) by reciting Jambü dvïpe, Bhãrata khande, Rajasthan rãje, Alwar nagare, a pro- gression of ever smaller places). Mythic spaces also provide fields on which socio-religious rituals unfold in conformity with cosmic forces. Above all, the mythical geography of Hindus is thought to be eternal. It is replete with sacred symbols and legends of gods, goddesses and rsis, whose religious significance is taken as everlasting. The design of mythical geography The design of Hindu mythical geography is essentially based on the cosmic chakra and its derivative spiraling mandala (circle). For Hindus the wheel is a fundamental geometric figure for conceptualizing both space and time. Drawing inspiration from the concept of the wheel, the Purãnas postulate that the earth comprises, as already noted, seven concentric ring-shaped dvïpas (continents) alternating with seven annular oceans, centered on the golden Mount Meru. Jambü is the innermost dvTpa and Puskara the out- ermost. The intervening five dvïpas moving outwards are: Plaksa, Sãlmala, Kuša, Krauñca and Saka. Jambu-dvïpa is surrounded by the salt water ocean (lavana), Plaksa by the ocean of sugarcane juice (iksu rasa), Sãlmala by liquor ocean (surã), Kuša by the ocean of clarified butter (ghrta), Krauñca by the ocean of curd (dadhi), Saka by the ocean of milk (ksïra), and Puskara by the ocean of fresh water (svãdu jala) (Figure 2). The order of the naming of the continents and oceans is the same in each of the Mahã (ma- jor) Purãnas such as Visnu, Bhãgavata, Mãrkandeya, Vãyu, Agni, Garuda, Matsya etc. However, while there are slight differences in a few Upa (lesser) Purãnas, the names of the first and the last continents are the same in all of them, and minor differences do not alter the basic design of Purãnic geography. The area of the successive dvïpas and oceans increases by simple stepwise geometric progression. Beyond the out- ermost ocean of fresh water lies the land of gold, where no living being resides. It is twice the extent of the ocean of fresh water. The land of gold is surrounded by Lokãloka- a fabulous mountain which divides the visible from the realm of darkness (Wilson, 1961, p. 167), and the realm of peo- ple from that without people. A lokapãla (guardian deity) resides on each of the four cardinal points of the Lokãloka mountain to protect a quarter of the cosmos from evil forces. The innermost dvïpa, Jambü, is the smallest. Its diameter is said to be one lakh (100,000) yojanas (A yojana is an indefinite unit of distance sometimes taken to be equal to 32,000 cubits). The area of Plaksa, the next dvïpa is double that of the Jambü, that of Sãlmala, double the area of Plaksa and so on. Thus, each dvïpa is twice the size of the dvïpa which precedes it. The size of the oceans also increases geometrically in the same manner (Pargiter, 1888, p. 275). The Purãnas proclaim that the earth, with its continents, mountains and oceans is fifty crore (107) yojanas in extent (Wilson, 1961, p. 167; Bhãgavata Purãna, 1951, p. 316). The Bhãgavata Purãna says that one fourth of it (12.5 crore yojanas) is occupied by the Lokaloka mountain ( 195 1 , p. 316). But the combined diameter of the seven continents and seven oceans - each ocean being of the same size as the continent it encloses and each successive continent being twice the size ofthat which precedes it - amounts to only two crore and fifty-four lakh yojanas. The extent of golden land is two crore and fifty-six lakh yojanas (Wilson, 1961, p. 167 [7]). These figures add up to 17.60 crore yojanas, indicating a vast discrepancy in the extent of the world proclaimed by the Purãnas and the extent derived by computation based on the given extent of Jambu-dvïpa (one lakh yojanas). The structure of purãnic geography The geography of Purãnas is structured on three tiers. To be- gin with, the Purãnas divide the world into seven continents and seven oceans and name an eponymous tree for each con- tinent. Secondly, the Purãnas divide each continent into a number of countries and describe their main mountains and rivers briefly. But the account of Jambu-dvïpa is given in greater detail, each of its nine divisions receiving individual treatment. Finally, India (Bhãrata- varsa) is divided into nine parts. Its main mountains (kula-parvatas), rivers and jana- padas (regions) are listed. The list varies from one Purãna to the other. Some Purãnas describe the tïrthas (pilgrimage places) of a small region in detail. For example, the Vãmana Purãna describes the holy places of Kuruksetra (the region in which the epic Mahabhãrata war was fought). In addition to the description of mountains and rivers, the Purãnas discuss the composition of society in terms of the four varnas (broad caste groups) of Brãhmanism in each continent and each varsa of Jambü-dvípa. Then they narrate the moral quality of life, such as contentment and happi- ness, the characteristics of the four eons of time (krta, treta, dvãpara and kali yuga), and the length of life and forms of gods in each continent and in each varsa of Jambu-dvïpa. The mountains constitute boundaries between adjacent countries, but are also depicted as sacred domains of gods. The rivers too are sacred, their waters having the power to wash away sin. Mountains and rivers thus provide the solid foundation to the religio-mythical landscapes of the Hindus. Division of the dvïpas The Purãnas narrate that Priyavrata, the son of Svayambhu Manu, was installed as the king of the earth. Once when Priyavrata was travelling on the earth in a chariot with great speed, deep channels made by the wheels of the chariot became the seven seas and the land left over became the seven island continents (Bhãgavata Purãna, 1951, p. 275). Priyavrata had ten sons. Three of them took to a religious life and did not covet dominion (Wilson, 1961, p. 131). Priyavrata having divided the earth into seven continents, gave each of them to one of his seven remaining sons (Wilson, 1961, p. 132). The seven sons of Priyavrata each of whom was made the monarch of a dvïpa, divided their dvïpas in turn among</page><page sequence="5">their sons. The king of the innermost dvipa (Jambu) had nine sons. He apportioned Jambü into nine countries and gave a country to each son. The outermost dvïpa, Puskara, was divided into two parts by its king Sávala for his two sons. The remaining five dvïpas were each divided into seven parts since, by divine providence, their kings had seven sons each. The Purãnas unanimously divide Jambu-dvïpa into nine parts. The division adheres to the principle of symmetry. There are three countries in the north (Uttara-Kuru, Hiranya- varsa and Ramyaka-varsa), three in the south (Hari-varsa, Kimpurusa-varsa and Bhãrata-varsa), and three in a central belt (Ketumãla-varsa, Ilãvrta-varsa and Bhadrãsva-varsa) (Figure 3). However, in the Vãmana Purãna, the division of Jambu-dvïpa follows the pattern of the petals of a lo- tus. One country, Ilãvrta, is placed at the centre and eight countries appear in the cardinal and intermediate directions (Agrawala, 1964, pp. 26-27). Lastly, the Purãnas divide Bhãrata-varsa into nine parts and mention its seven kula-parvatas, rivers and janapadas. However, the listing of names varies from one Purãna to the other. It appears from the account given in the Purãnas that the connotation of Bhãrata underwent a change during the Gupta period (320-c. 540 C.E.). 'The name Bhãrata was then the designation not only of India proper but it also included the islands of the Indian ocean, like Ceylon, Andamans, Nicobars, Java, Bali and Sumatra" (Agrawala, 1964, p. 27). These islands, termed dvTpãntam in the Gupta period, constituted an extension of the cultural realm of In- dian civilization in terms of art, architecture, religion and philosophy. Most of the Purãnas list eight of the divisions of Bhãrata- varsa, with slight variations; but the ninth dvTpa described as encircled by seas, with Kirãtas on the east and Yavanas on the west and with the four varnas of Brãhmanism residing in it, is not mentioned by name. Only the Vãmana Purãna names the ninth division as Kumara-dvïpa, while the Skanda Purãna calls it as Kumãrikã. The list of eight divisions given in the Vãmana Purãna is as follows: Indra-dvïpa, Kaseruka, Tãmraparna, Gabhastimãna, Naga-dvïpa, Kataha, Simhala, and Varuna. Significance of numbers seven, four and nine In the Hindu religious traditions the numeral seven has oc- cupied a very significant position since ancient times. The cosmic significance of number seven was probably first dis- cerned by the Babylonians as is evident from the seven tiers of the Ziggurats. But "Vedic India was anyway well able from indigenous sources to supply rich mythological precedents for the cosmic importance of the number seven" (Mabbett, 1983, p. 65). Instance after instance may be cited of the use of the numeral seven in the Hindu religion. There are seven rsis, seven Rgvedic rivers, seven soma samsthã, seven havi samsthã and seven pãk samsthã sacrifices (im- portant Vedic rituals), seven steps around the sacred fire to solemnize marriage, seven tongues of Agni, seven horses of the sun's chariot (which are also seven meters of Vedas) 273 and seven stages of creation. It is hardly surprising, there- fore, that the Purãnas have erected an over- arching schema of world geography based on the numeral seven. They have construed a world consisting of seven continents and seven oceans, seven lokas and seven pãtãlas (nether- worlds). Five of the dvïpas are divided into seven countries each. Each of them has seven rivers and seven mountains. Prior to the emergence of the concept of saptadvTpã va- sumatï, the organizing principle of the geography of the Purãnas was based on the number four. The cosmic signifi- cance of number four lies in the fact that it distills the magic of the four cardinal directions and the divinity of Brahmã (who has four faces corresponding to the cardinal direc- tions). Moreover, "According to the Indian conception, the idea of total, or totality, is associated with the number four" (Zimmer, 1990, p. 13). The chaturdvípã design accounts for the auspiciousness of the svastika. ChaturdvTpã vasumatï and the geography of Mount Meru are based on the number four. After falling from heaven onto Meru, the Ganga divides into four streams corresponding to cardinal directions. Other examples may be cited such as four Vedas, four varnas, four ãsramas (stages) in the life of a Brahman, four lokapãlas, four classes of pitrs (ancestors) and four claws of svastika etc. The number nine too has cosmic significance for Hin- dus. The Brahmãnda is divided into nine segments. Some mándalas are also divided into nine squares. There are nine months of pregnancy, nine nidhis (treasures), and nine ratnas (gems). Probably to conform to the division of mándalas, the Purãnas divide Jambu-dvïpa into nine parts. They also divide Bhãrata-varsa into nine parts. The Purãnas make use of these cosmic numerals to create an ambience that the dvïpas are divinely ordained units. Symbolic significance of Meru Hindu cosmology, unlike the ethnocentric Jerusalem- centered cosmology of Judeo-Christian faiths, is centered on Mount Meru and not on India or any one of its holy cities. Meru, therefore, has great significance in Hinduism. It is pertinent, therefore, to discuss the geography of Meru and its symbolism. Mount Meru is the highest point in the mythical geography of the Hindus. It is the navel of the earth and the axis mundi. Meru rises to a stupendous height of 84,000 yojanas. Its depth below the surface of the earth is 16,000 yojanas. It is a mountain like a seed cup of the lotus of the earth (Wilson, 1961, p. 35). It has four corners and four colours (Pargiter, 1888, p. 276). Four mountains of Ilãvrta-varsa form buttresses to Meru, one on each side. Each of the buttress mountains has a cosmic tree of stupen- dous height like a banner. Twenty mountain ridges project from the base of Meru like filaments from the stamen of a lotus, five from each cardinal direction. Meru is situated between the mountains of Nïla and Nisadha in the north and south and between Mãlyavãna and Gandhamãdana on the west and east. On each of these mountains are four lakes and four forests (Bhãgavata Purãna, 1951, p. 304). On the top of Meru is the vast city of Brahmã, 16,000 yojanas wide.</page><page sequence="6">274 Around it are situated the eight cities of lokapãlas at cardinal and intermediate points. The capital of Brahma is washed by the sacred waters of the Ganga. The above description demonstrates that the geography of Meru is very complex. It is, in fact, an embodiment of several strains. It was commonly believed that Meru was conceived from the ziggurats of Babylon. But Mabbett ques- tions this assumption (1983, p. 65). Paul Mus is of the opinion that the development of the tapestry of traditions surrounding Meru in India was woven essentially by na- tive genius (Mabbett, 1983, p. 65). Meru as a cosmic lotus provides the main organizing principle of Hindu religious symbolism. It has 'many layers of symbolism that exchange Meru for the cosmic man, for the temple at the centre of the universe, for the office of kingship, for the stüpa, for the mandala, and for the internal ascent undertaken by the tantric mystic' (Mabbett, 1983, p. 66). Above all, it is the symbolic hub of the universe, oriented to the magic of cardinal points and the divinities of the lokapãlas and Brahmã. The Ganga descends on it from heaven and the heavenly bodies revolve around it. Meru 'is not simply a point at the center of a circle; it is a vertical shaft which links macrocosm with microcosm, gods with men, timelessness with time' (Mabbett, 1983, p. 68). Significance of mountains and rivers Mountains and rivers occupy exalted places in the geography of the Purãnas, and are important features of the mythical landscape. Mountains have dual roles: (1) they are deployed as natural boundaries separating countries from one another and (2) they function as symbols of the sacred. They are 'the images that express the connection between heaven and earth' (Eliade, 1961, p. 13). They direct human imagination towards height. Mountains are abodes of gods, saints and rsis. Siva's abode is Mount Kailãsa and his consort Pârvatï was a daughter of the Himalayas. Mountains, therefore, con- tain holy places, objects of pilgrimage sites that sanctify the landscape. The Purãnas, therefore, never fail to describe the mountain system of every continent and of Bhãrata-varsa. Moreover, as noted, the geography of the Purãnas is centered on Mount Meru, the greatest of all the mountains, the symbol of stability. "In India, rivers are a focus of religious attention" (Feld- haus, 1995, p. 3). The myth of the descent of the Ganga from heaven onto the earth amply demonstrates that river water has great sanctity in Hindu religious traditions. "This sacred stream [the Ganga], heard of, desired, seen, touched, bathed in, or hymned, day by day, sanctifies all beings..." (Wilson, 1961, p. 188). Rivers are thus considered sacred by the Hindus. Their water purifies a man, washes away sins and ablutions in rivers may lead to moksa (freedom from the cycle of rebirth). The ashes of the dead are laved in the Ganga for the same reason. The sinful sons of Sagara were raised to heaven by washing their ashes in the Ganga (Wilson, 1961, p. 188). The Purãnas make it a point to de- scribe the principal rivers of every continent and never fail to mention the purifying character of their water. The holy mountains and the sacred rivers provide a meaningful base for the religious landscape that the Purãnas have created so assiduously. They provide setting and sub- stance to myth. Naming of the continents and oceans A streak of vegetal motif runs through Hindu religious thought. Trees and forests occupy exalted positions in the Purãnas and the vegetal motif predominates in the nam- ing of continents. The stupendous eponymous tree on each continent is a symbolic cosmic tree. "Its roots lie in the underworld, its branches touch heaven while its trunk is the more accessible source of life" (Davies, 1988, p. 35). The cosmic tree is, thus, a symbol of power and eternity. Hence, according to the Vãyu and Brahmãnda Purãnas, the inhabitants of Saka-dvïpa worshiped the saka tree and those of Plaksa-dvïpa the plaksa tree (Roy, 1966, pp. 303, 306) (Neither of these Purãnas specifies the name of any specific deity for these dvïpas). Moreover, on each of Meru' s four buttress mountains stands a tree of stupendous size towering aloft like a banner. Each of the continents, except Krauñca, is named after the prominent tree (or other vegetal form) that grows there. Jambu-dvïpa is named after the stupendous jamba (rose apple) tree, Plaksa-dvïpa after the plaksa (fig) tree, Sãlmala- dvïpa after the salmali (silk-cotton) tree, Kusa-dvïpa after the kuša grass (poa), Saka-dvïpa after the saka (teak) tree and Puskara-dvïpa after the lotus. Although Kraunca-dvïpa takes its name after the moun- tain of the same name, it too has a vegetal character. It is said that Mount Krauñca was destroyed by the lance of Kãrtikeya (the god of war); but on receiving nourishment from the ocean of milk and protection from Varuna (the god of seas), it regained its former form (Bhãgavata Parana, 1951, p. 315). The countries of each continent are named after the grandsons of Priyavrata, who were made monarchs of them by their fathers. But the naming of India as Bhärata is a dif- ferent story. Agnidhara, the king of Jambu-dvïpa, gave India to Nãbhi, who had by his queen Meru the magnanimous son Risabha. He had one hundred sons, the eldest and ablest of whom was Bhãrata. Risabha, after ruling for quite some time, consigned the sovereignty of India to Bharata and re- tired to the hermitage of Pulatsya. 'The country was termed Bhãrata from the time that it was relinquished to Bharata by his father' (Wilson, 1961, p. 133). The Purãnas also tell us that India is called Bhärata for here dwell the descendants of Bharata (Wilson, 1961, p. 141). Superficially, it appears that the oceans are fancifully named, like candy objects in a fairy tale. But the naming has some symmetry and symbolic significance. The innermost salt-water sea is placed in opposition to the outermost fresh- water sea. The intervening five seas are named as sugarcane juice (iksu rasa), liquor (surã), clarified butter (ghrta), curd (dadhi) and milk (ksTra). If we move inward from the sea of freshwater, there is a symbolic concatenation of the con- tents of the seas. Milk turns into curd and clarified butter</page><page sequence="7">is obtained from curd. Similarly, there is a link between sugarcane juice and liquor. Moreover, the sea of milk has great significance in Hindu mythology as it was churned by gods and demons to obtain ambrosia. It also provided nourishment to the depleted Krauñca mountain, to Mount Mandrã (the mythic churning stick), and indirectly to Meru (Mabbett, 1983, p. 71). Visnu's abode is located in the ocean of milk. Deification of landscape The Purãnas deify the landscape by assigning gods to vari- ous parts of it. The deification of landscape makes it sacred and worthy of adoration. The presence of Brahma and other gods at the top of Meru, enhances its holiness and sanctity. The Purãnas also assign a god to each of the dvïpas and each of the varsas of Jambü-dvípa. Any incarnation of Visnu in a given var sa sanctifies its landscape as an object of veneration and worship. The Visnu Purãna tells us that Visnu is worshiped in the form of Soma in Plaksa-dvïpa, Vayu in Sãlmala, Brahmã in Ku ša, Rudra in Krauñca, Sürya (the sun) in Saka and Brahmã in Puskara. The landscapes of the varsas of Jambü- dvípa are also deified by the presence of gods. The four ancient countries of the chaturdvTpã v asuman have non- anthropomorphic incarnations as deities. Bhadrãsva has Hayasira (horse head), Bhãrata has Kašyapa (tortoise), Ke- tumãla has Varãha (boar) and Kuru has Matsya (fish). For the remaining five dvïpas, the Visnu Purãna does not men- tion any god. The Bhãgavata Purãna has, however, given the names of the following forms in which Visnu is worshiped in these dvïpas. Ilãvrta, which is centered on Meru, has Brahmã as its presiding deity, Bhãrata has Nara-Nãrãyana, Kimpurusa has Rama, Ramyaka has Matsya and Hiranmaya has Kašyapa. Divisions of society and the moral landscape The Purãnic writers created their geography in terms of Hindu religious beliefs. They divided society in each con- tinent and in each of the nine countries of Jambü into four varnas of Brãhmanism. The Purãnas make us believe that the dvïpas are peopled by Brãhmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaišyas and Südras, though these varnas are known by different names in different dvïpas. The people of different varnas are guided by varnãshrama dharma (rules setting forth their duties). To make their message credible and forceful, the Purãnas describe the moral quality of life in the seven continents. The landscape is 'ethicised' for eschatological considera- tions (Schwartzberg, 1992, p. 334). It is said that life in the intervening five dvïpas from Plaksa to Saka is peaceful and happy and that righteousness prevails there. But the outer- most dvïpa is the region of twenty-one hells according to the Vãmana Purãna (Agrawala, 1964, p. 23). In the Visnu Purãna, Puskara-dvïpa is described as a terrestrial paradise as here the Vedas, Purãnas, ethics, polity and laws of service are unknown (Wilson, 1961, p. 166). 275 In Jambü-dvípa, happiness and perfection exist in all the countries except Bhãrata. 'The eight Varshas, or countries, Kimpurusha and the rest, are places of perfect enjoyment, where happiness is spontaneous and uninterrupted' (Wilson, 1961, p. 132). In these countries there are no temporal cycles (yugas), rather, the character of time is uniformly that of the treta (or silver) age (Wilson, 1961, p. 163). Bharata is a land of acts (karma-bhümi) in consequence of which men go to heaven. No other country is character- ized as a land of acts. Bhãrata is the only country where the succession of yugas takes place. It is the country where ascetics engage in penances, devout men offer sacrifices, and pious men distribute gifts, all for the sake of gaining entry to another world (Wilson, 1961, p. 144). Bharata is the best of the divisions of Jambü-dvípa because it is the land of acts; others are places of enjoyment. 'It is only after many thousand births, and the aggregation of much merit, that liv- ing beings are sometimes born in Bhãrata as men' (Wilson, 1961, p. 145). Bhãrata is the only land in the universe where emancipation is obtained by the accumulated merits of one's acts. Analysis The symbolism of the lotus permeates Hindu culture in re- ligion, art, architecture and literature. The lotus motif also pervades the landscape of the Purãnas. For the Purãnas the earth is a cosmic lotus and Mount Meru its pericarp. The lotus provided the chief organising principle of the chaturdvïpa vasumatï. Lotus symbolism is also retained metaphorically in the saptadvïpa vasumatï. The outermost dvïpa (Puskara) takes its appellation from the lotus which has 100,000 golden petals and is believed to be the seat of Brahmã. Mount Meru is likened to be the seed cup of the 'lotus of the earth'. Each of the seven dvïpas has a stupendous eponymous tree. Similarly each of the four buttress mountains is sur- mounted by a cosmic tree. Meru's environs contain celestial forests. A streak of vegetal motif thus runs through the geog- raphy of the Purãnas, conveying the message that the Purãnic landscape abounds in vegetal energy (Bosch, 1960, pp. 230- 231). This is especially testified by the vegetal character of Mount Krauñca. Another important organising principle of space and time for Hindus is the chakra (wheel). "The vast universe is a wheel, the wheel of Brahman... Round and round it turns and never stops" (Švetašvatara Upanisad 1, 6-8). The con- cept of time (kãla chakra) in the Purãnas is cyclic. Time is conceptualised as cycles occuring within larger cycles. Similarly, the concept of space is circular. Here too, there is encapsulation of annular rings within annular rings of land and water (Gombrich, 1975, pp. 111-112). Time and space for the Purãnas are intrinsically related to each other. The Sanskrit word varsa means both a year and a country. Mandala an archetypal spatial figure and the chakravãlas of the Buddhists are also derived from the concept of the chakra. Moreover, the dimension of space increases from the centre outwards in simple geometric progression ( 1 , 2, 4,</page><page sequence="8">276 8...) and that of time from the present kaliyuga to preceding yugas in the ratio of 1, 2, 3, 4. Purãnic geography may be related to known terrestrial features in Bhãrata, the home of the writers of the Purãnas. It becomes increasingly fictive and archetypal as one moves away from that locus. It may not be out of context here to point out that the concept of time in Purãnas is real or historical in the immediate past but becomes cosmological or mythical as we move towards past yugas (Thapar, 1996, p. 31). Grandeur and vastness, which inspire human imagina- tion, dominate the landscape of the Purãnas. The Purãnic landscape has vast dimensions, fabulous mountains, stu- pendous trees and mighty rivers; but grandest of all is the cosmic Mount Meru, the navel of the Purãnic world. The multi-layered symbolism of Meru makes it much more than a simple feature on the cosmographie map. "Meru rose up in a third dimension; in doing so, it pierced the heavens; in piercing the heavens, it transcended time as well as space" (Mabbett, 1983, p. 66). The geography of the Purãnas is a mental construct, a product of myth and imagination. It is structured on the mystique of cosmic numerals. Number seven has a place of pride in Hindu religious thought, beginning with the Rgvedic Saptarsi (seven sages) and continuing to the saptadvTpã vasumatï of the Purãnas. Purãnic geography is organized within an overarching schema based on the cosmic number seven. The numbers four and nine have played secondary roles in the organization of the Purãnic landscape. A deep subtext of ethics runs through the Purãnic land- scape. It is a moral landscape filled with religious symbols. It was construed for eschatological consideration, for the liberation of the soul from the cycles of birth and rebirth. The landscape is 'ethiciseď and broadly divided into two categories. First, Bhärata, as the karma-bhümi (land of acts), is a distinctive part of the Purãnic world where moksa may be attained in consequence of accumulated merits of good deeds. Secondly, the rest of the world which is conceived as the bhoga-bhümi or places of enjoyment, happiness and contentment. The principle of symmetry also governs the mythical landscape of the Purãnas. Rings of land alternate with the rings of water. Bhärata, as the land of acts, is placed in opposition to the terrestrial paradise of the outermost dvïpa. The landscapes of the intervening five dvTpas display sym- metry based on the number seven. Each of them has seven mountains, seven rivers and seven varsas. Human security was one of the important considerations of the writers of the Purãnas. In that enclosure provides se- curity, as an enclosed house provides security and comfort to man (Heideyer in Harvey, 1990, p. 217), they construed a finite and enclosed world. The known world is enclosed within rings of land and water like moats and ramparts of a fort. Moreover, the Purãnic world is protected by the bulwark of Lokãloka mountain and the four lokapãlas that are housed on it in cardinal directions. The Purãnas make one believe that the world is divinely ordained to provide security and orientation to humankind in the cosmos. Conclusion The landscapes of the Purãnas are divine creations of gi- gantic land and water masses. They are cosmic archetypes derived from religious and mystic experience. As time is represented by a wheel and as Hindu mythology sees the universe going through cycles of annihilation and creation, so the geography of the Purãnas is modeled on the archetypal image of the chakra in which a circular pattern represents the idea of the universe. Specifically, it is a copy of a mandala produced by a combination of concentric circles. The round continents and oceans symbolise the terrestrial world and the square of Meru within it is a symbol of heaven. The geography of Indian civilization is symbolic rather than representative; it is rule-based, rather than imitative. It seeks to give order to the world and is concerned with the representation of archetypes rather than reproduction of real- ity. The geography of the Hindus, far from reflecting reality, endeavours to create its own reality based on archetypal images and cosmic numbers. The Purãnas have constructed a religious landscape charged with cosmic symbolism, for the salvation of devout religious persons from the cycle of birth and rebirth. Purãnic landscapes are peopled by gods, celestial spirits, mytholog- ical figures and human beings. The cosmic drama of gods unfolds in the higher reaches of this landscape. The vales within the mountains are meant for the enjoyment of mytho- logical figures. All the varsas except Bhãrata are places of uninterrupted enjoyment. Bhãrata, the known world, is sin- gled out by the Purãnas as karma-bhümi (land of acts). In consequence of the accumulated merits attainable from one's acts humans may aspire to attain moksa. We have discussed one aspect of the Hindu cosmology. Its other aspects, which deal with relations between humans and nature and their place in nature, also call for the attention of scholars.
