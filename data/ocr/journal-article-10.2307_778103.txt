<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCERPTS FROM User's Manual PATTIE BELLE HASTINGS As machines and bodies increasingly become fused, Cyborg Theory cele- brates, criticizes, and condemns the process - the machine/body relationship is at once liberating and oppressing. While movies and fiction depict the Cyborg as a futuristic superhuman or technological monster, my new body of work proposes that it is actually your average Mother and Housewife that are among the first so-called Cyborgs. The machine has extended the body of the mother for centuries as she tended the stove, cranked the washer, peddled the sewing machine, and vacu- umed the house, but she hardly exists in discussions of technological culture, except as a consuming unit for manu- facturing and advertising or in the case of reproductive technologies - the body that carries the baby. There has been little or no discussion about the post- partum technologizing of the mother and child. With microchips embedded in everything from toys and greeting cards to thermometers and baby moni- tors, increasingly, the mother/child rela- tionship is mediated, complicated and enhanced by machines. We are encour- aged to feed our infants information as if we were storing data on a hard drive with a push to begin "programming" their brains in utero. What is a cyborg mother to do? Here's to the recognition of the Cyborg Mommy - the Cyborg as oppressed and the Cyborg as liberated. "Cyborg Mommy" is an ongoing body of work, cyberfeminist in nature, that includes video, multimedia CD-ROM, perfor- mance, costume, books, digital ephemera, and printed matter. "Cyborg Mommy" is also a costumed perfor- mance persona that embodies hybridity, parody, and capitulation in the merging of flesh and technology, woman and machine. The CD-ROM documents are embedded with image, sound, video and are hyperlinked to each other and dozens of websites that are cyberfemi- nist, hip mother, and cyborg in content.

It involves an interrelation offluctuating identities which must be navigated as the same system and differentiated at the same time; it is a process of uncontrollable events among two willfiul systems - and we allfirst negotiate this condi- tion in our experiences as a child.
