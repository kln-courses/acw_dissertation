<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES A LOST LEAF FROM THE ALEPPO CODEX RECOVERED by Malachi Beit-Arie A parchment leaf of a biblical manuscript recently donated to the Jewish National and University Library by Mrs. Mary Hedaya of Brooklyn, New York, through her niece Mrs. Shulamit Romanov of Jerusalem, has proved to be a lost leaf from the renowned Aleppo Codex. The leaf contains the text of II Chronicles 35:7—36:19, which was missing in the Codex brought to Jerusalem in 1958. The author points out the identity of the unique shapes of graphic fillers inserted at the end of lines in both Codex Aleppo and MS Leningrad, Public Library, II Firkovitch B 17 written by Solomon ben Buya'a in 929. Such identity of personal scribal practices, in addition to the similarity of the scripts, strongly supports the statement of the lost colophon of Codex Aleppo, which ascribes the writing of the Codex to Solomon ben Buya'a. THE VOCALIZATION AND ACCENTUATION OF THE RECENTLY RECOVERED LEAF OF MS. ALEPPO by Israel Yeivin The author describes the text, vocalization and accentuation of the recently recovered leaf of Ms. Aleppo. It contains four verses on which there are divergencies or congruencies between Ben Asher and Ben Naftali; its version in all of them is according to Ben Asher. The leaf also contains two words in which a non-guttural consonant is vocalized with hateph patah, a customary feature of this manuscript. The original scribe of the manuscript placed a colon at the end of only one third to one half of the verses. In this leaf — as well as in only one other leaf of the manuscript — another scribe added colons to almost all the other verses.</page><page sequence="2">VI ENGLISH SUMMARIES DEUTERONOMY 5:28-6:1: COMPOSITION AND TEXT IN THE LIGHT OF DEUTERONOMIC STYLE AND THREE TEFILLIN FROM QUMRAN (4Q 128, 129, 137) by Alexander Rofe A characteristic of Deuteronomic style is the transitional formula: after introducing a new subject and before describing it in detail, the main elements of the subject are again mentioned, thus emphasizing its importance. This feature obtains in Deuteronomy 11:32-12:1; 19:3-4; Joshua 11:16-20 with 12:7-8a; Judges 2:23-3:1. The transitional formula appears also in Deuteronomy 5:28—6:1, but is burdened here by the presence of verses 5:29-30. Indeed these verses are a cumbersome exhortation unfitting the context of God's command to Moses (5:27—28) which is followed by Moses' fulfilment of the command (6:1 ff.). Both these arguments suggest that 5:29-30 are a secondary addition to the text. The recently published Tefilin from Qumran (4Q 128,129,137) appear to contain a shorter text at the end of Deuteronomy 5 which has been explained by their publisher (Milik) as a result of homoeoteleuton. However, a closer look at the poorly preserved 4Q 128 makes it likely that it read 6:1 right after 5:28, skipping verses 5:29-30. The same text was probably followed by 4Q 129, 137 as well. If right, this reading from Qumran would confirm our conjecture, based on stylistic and contentual criteria, about the original text of Deuteronomy 5:28-6:1 'FORWARD' TRANSACTIONS IN JEWISH LAW (Kol she-ein lo goren, kozez imo kol zeman she-yirzeh [Tosefta, B. Meziah, vi:5]) by Ben-Zion Eliash Transactions whereby the purchaser, in return for a price reduction, pays in advance for goods tobe supplied to him at a future date, were seen by the scholars as forbidden by virtue of the interest prohibition. They did, however, permit transactions of this kind if the agreed price conformed with the traded product's market price at the time of closing the bargain, and provided the stated market price was stable. The above Tosefta statement distinguishes, for the purpose of the abovementioned halakhah, between products which are subject to seasonal price fluctuations — in which case such forward transactions are permissible only when the products are in season — and products which are evenly available on the market throughout the year. In the time of Ribash, R. Moses Gabbai of Majorca sought in effect to abolish the abovementioned prohibition by the proposition that it applied only to restricted markets where every product had a uniform price, and not to sophisticated 'contemporary' markets where the same product had different prices, concurrently or at short intervals. R. Gabbai's innovative approach was apparently based on a different version of the above Tosefta statement, and although it was rejected by Ribash, remains most instructive and forms the subject of the present research.</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES VII ־AN IMPORTANT MA'ASE' — A NEW FRAGMENT OF MA'ASIM LIVNEIERETZ ISRAEL by MordechaiA. Friedman The MS edited in this study, Taylor-Schechter NS 167.48, contains the latter portion of a Palestinian formulary of the !evirate release (halisa) and a ma'ase (ruling), introduced by the words מעשה גדול (an important ruling); the decision itself begins with כך הוא המעשה (such is the ruling). The MS probably was part of a collection of Ma'asim Livnei Eretz Israel in which the levirate release formulary was quoted in a ruling. But it could have consisted of ma'asim as well as other Palestinian writings. The halisa formulary, some interesting variations notwithstanding, resembles other such formularies known from the Gaonic period. Professor S. Lieberman has suggested that the writing of halisa (and me'un) documents was discontinued in Palestine in the early Mishnaic period. Their use in the post-Talmudic period reflects a borrowing from the Babylonian practice. It is here suggested that evidence for a borrowing from Babylonia may be found both in the formulary and language of the Palestinian forms. The second paragraph discusses the case of Jews of a certain province (אפרכייה) who were forced to apostatize. Some had wives in another province, but they were unable to travel there. In order to release their wives, they instructed their scribe, who also had been forced to apostatize, to write bills of divorce for them. These were delivered by a former Jew who had apostatized at some earlier date. The respondent ruled that the divorces were valid. Since these Jews converted under compulsion, their intentions could be assumed to be pious. This case undoubtedly occured during the pre-Islamic period; but the exact time and the location of the province cannot be determined. The writing is discontinued before the end of the ruling. SOME HALAKHIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JUDAISM AND ISLAM by Ha VA Lazarus-Yafeh The striking similarity of Judaism and Islam as two halakhic monotheistic religions is a well known fact, about which much has been written. However, little attention has been given to the differences between the two systems of laws, although the study of such distinctions may be most important for any attempt to define the basic characteristics and uniqueness of each of the two halakhic systems. This article, therefore, points out some basic differences between Jewish and Islamic halakha, which require a more detailed study. One major distinction is the important agricultural aspect of Jewish halakha, which is almost completely absent from the mercantile Islamic civilization. This explains, among other things, some well-known differences between the two systems regarding the laws of inheritance, and similarly sheds light on the basic characteristics of Friday (and the Islamic festivals in general) as compared to the Shabbat. Other major differences exist, for example, in the domain of the laws of purity and impurity. The great similarity between the two systems notwithstanding, only in Judaism are the laws of purity connected with the Temple cult and</page><page sequence="4">VIII ENGLISH SUMMARIES priesthood. Yet another distinction in this area relates to the leper or corpse, both of which are not considered a source of defilement in Islam. However, according to Islamic law an impure man or woman may not pray, fast or circumambulate the Ka'ba. The article also deals with dietary laws. For example: no benefit whatsoever may be derived from forbidden food according to Islam. The author also discusses some political and other aspects of Islamic law, which also differ from Jewish halakha. PESHAT AND APOLOGETICS IN THE RASHBAM'S COMMENTARY ON THE BIBLICAL STORIES OF MOSES by Elazar Touitou The exegetical work of Rashbam is well anchored in the renaissance of the 12th century. His commentary to the Pentateuch was לפי דרך ארץ ולתשובת המינים'' (secundum physicam and as a response to the Christians). This paper examines the manner in which Rashbam employed his exegetical method to comment on the biblical stories of Moses. In the first part of the article the author surveys the position of Christian theologians on the person of Moses. This position is ambivalent. On the one hand Moses was depicted as a prefiguration of Jesus. On the other hand his person was rendered superior to Christ. The Glossa Ordinaria, a basic book in the Christian education of the 12th century, clearly reflects this ambivalence, and the scholars of St. Victor, who developed a literal method of exegetics, gave to the word of Moses a Christian historiosophical explanation. The author continues, in the second part of the article, to show that Rashbam's commentary to the biblical stories of Moses endeavors to reject both Christian typological exegetics as well as Christian historiosophical interpretation. Rashbam presents a Jewish standpoint on Moses as a legislator and a mediator between God and Israel. THE SEFIROT ABOVE THE SEFIROT by Moshe Idel The existence of ten supernal sefiroi — also referred to as hawayot — above the ten regular sefirot, was a postulate held by all the important Kabbalistic schools of the thirteenth century. This seems to be an old tradition, the earliest expression of which is a passage of Monoimos, preserved in Hippolytus and in various pre-Kabbalistic Hebrew texts. Both Monoimos and a major portion of the Kabbalists presented anthropomorphic descriptions of these ten supernal entities.</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES IX TOWARD THE STUDY OF THE JEWISH PROVERB (An Analysis of 'Do not trust the gentile even after forty years in the grave') by Galit Hasan-Rokem The paper deals with the proverb as a specific folk literary genre. The analysis is based on a comprehensive definition of the proverb: a genre of folk literature which presents a specifically structured poetical summary referring to collective experience. The proverb is used in recurring situations by the members of an ethnic group to interpret a behavioral oy interactional situation, usually one which is a source of conflict or scepticism. The analysis proceeds on four levels: text, use, structure and function. The text dealt with is the proverb 'Do not trust the gentile even after forty years in the grave', which is extant, mainly in Hebrew, among Jews originating in the Islamic countries. The uses recorded and analyzed here are both co-texts, i.e. narrative contexts, and contexts, i.e. behavioral contexts. The structure referred to is the semantic structure of the proverb, which is analyzed by means of 'componential analysis'. It is shown that the semantic structure of a proverb text may vary in different uses. The text and the uses are discussed in their traditional as well as their contemporary manifestations. The proverb or its kernel may be traced to medieval and even earlier literature. In the contemporary texts we may discern regional variation such as the North-African variant 'Do not trust the gentile even after forty years in the grave' versus the Yemenite/Iraqi version 'Do not trust the gentile even in the grave'. The function is defined as an ideational statement common to all the uses of the proverb text; more general functions are common to several proverb texts which constitute a semantic group, in our case 'Do not trust X' — where the X-member may be 'women', 'beardless men', 'overly righteous' etc. ■This is a model for the analysis of one proverb text. When this model is applied to a large corpus it is possible to carry out an indexing on a structural-semantic basis. 'לזאת יקרא אשה כי מאיש לקחה־זאת' (Gen. 2:23) — A FOLK ETYMOLOGY? by S1MCHA KOGUT Scholars to date have considered the etymology in Genesis 2:23 to be a folk one, since they derived איש and אשה from different roots. A critical examination, however, points to the weaknesses of all the suggestions for the etymology of איש and אשה, and for their connections with אנוש—אנשים on the one hand, and נשים-אשות on the other. The author accepts that both איש־אנשים and אשה-נשים were matched by suppletion. One can, of course, consider the matching of איש-אשה in the same way, but with the same degree of certainty we can derive איש-אשה from a common root: אוש-אשש — namely:עי"ו which acts sometimes as ע"ע. Its meaning is strength (compare: גבר). The plural form of אשה from this root is אשות (occurs only in Ez. 23:44). It can be suggested that אש,ה was used in Hebrew, and was</page><page sequence="6">ENGLISH SUMMARIES confused with the pseudo-identical אש2ה (which was more commonly used and known) and therefore scholars did not notice it. In any case, נש!ים does not have a singular form, and was derived from a third root. 'אין ... אלא' — AN AMBIGUOUS EXPRESSION? by Moshe Azar The reading in the words of Rabbi Aqiba in Mishna Erubin 2:5, according to good manuscripts, is: אפילו אין בה אלא אחד מכל אלו''■ But if one attributes to this sentence its usual interpretation ('Even if there is in it only one of all these'), there is no possibility of establishing a comprehensible text. Therefore, there is room to conclude that the above sentence expresses a polemic negation, a denial of an assertion: 'Even if it is not true that only one of all these is in it.' GREEK IN THE TALMUD: THREE NOTES PERTAINING TO DOGS by Joseph Geiger 'The face of the generation will be as the face of a dog, and the son will not feel ashamed before his father' (Mishna Sotah 9:15; BT Sanhedrin 97a). The notion of the dog as the shameless animal par excellence is Greek rather than Jewish; our text indicates Greek influence. 'He who keeps a bad dog in his house deprives his house of lovingkindness, as it is said: "To him that is afflicted (LMS) kindness should be shewed from his friend" (Job. 6:14), as in Greek a dog is called LMS' (BT Shabbat 63a-b). LMS (with frequent metathesis in liquids)=MLS = molossus, the best known breed of dogs in antiquity, and often equalling 'dog' in literature. 'And there went out a champion ("«A habbenayim") (I Sam. 17:4)... what is benayirn*.... R. Yohanan said: The son of a hundred PPY and one NNY' (BT Sotah 42b). NNY is akin to the Greek words vawr), vdvvcn;, vlvvr!, v'tvtaaa,and should be interpreted as either a close female relative or a nanny, vel sim.; the traditonal interpretation — 'dog' — is totally unfounded. THE DEPICTION OF THE RAM IN THE AQEDAH MOSAIC AT BEIT ALPHA by Marc Bregman In the mosaic floor of the 6th century synagogue at Beit Alpha, the ram in the portrayal of the Binding of Isaac is depicted standing not horizontally, but rather vertically with its horns in the upper branches of a tree. Sukenik suggested that this was simply due to lack of space, while Yevin</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES XI attempted to explain this detail as a motif borrowed from ancient Near Eastern art. It should be noted, however, that in Christian art, particularly in contemporaneous burial sarcophagi, the ram of the Aqedah scene is frequently portrayed as hanging from the branches of a tree. Such depictions clearly illustrate a Patristic typology in which the ram which was sacrificed instead of Isaac is seen as a prefiguration of Jesus who was hung from the cross. This detail and several other features in the Aqedah scene of the Beit Alpha mosaic suggest that the Jewish artists may have copied it from a Christian exemplar, without having understood its Christological iconography. BETWEEN CULTURAL INFLUENCE AND PARALLEL SOURCES by E. E. Hallewy In this note, the writer reaffirms his declaration that the sole purpose of his eight published volumes, dealing with the study of aggadic and halakhic texts in the light of Greek and Latin sources, is to explain and evaluate the aggadic and halakhic teachings of the rabbis. There is therefore no basis for the argument advanced by A. Shinan (Tarbiz 48 [1978], p. 20 Iff.) that 'the tendency of Hallewy to demonstrate the influence of Greco-Latin culture on Talmudic literature is not convincing', since there is no such tendency in the works published by this author to date. There is also no basis for an additional claim advanced by Shinan, namely that Hallewy is mistaken in claiming that the sin of Nadab and Abihu was seen by the rabbis as a transgression against 'human nature', and this — on the basis of parallels from Hellenistic and Roman society. In truth, the view that the entrance into the Holy of Holies is a serious danger to a human being is corroborated by both Tannaitic (cf. Mishna Yoma 5:1; Tos. ibid. 2:6) and Jewish-Hellenistic sources (cf. 3 Has. 1:14). A REJOINDER by Avigdor Shinan Despite Hallewy's claim that his sole purpose in his writings is to 'explain and evaluate the... teaching of the Rabbis in the light of Greek and Latin literature', examples can be cited to demonstrate that from time to time the author positively states that the non-Jewish cultures do have a direct influence on Rabbinic elaborations of biblical stories. Hallewy's line of thought, stimulating as it may be, is at times exaggerated, and it was against this tendency that the previous note (Tarbiz 48 [1978], p. 213, n. 67) was written. Concerning Nadab and Abihu's entrance into the Holy of Holies, the writer repeats his view, that this action can more properly be defined as a violation of God's prohibition, rather than 'a sin against human nature' as claimed by Hallewy, on the basis of partial-parallels from Greek and Latin literature.</page><page sequence="8">XII ENGLISH SUMMARIES DID HIWI AL-BALKHI LIVE AND WRITE IN BALKH? by Benzion D. Yehoshua Contrary to the commonly-held view, recently repeated by E. Fleischer ('A Fragment from Hiwi Al Balkhi's Criticism of the Bible, Tarbiz 51 [1981], pp. 49-57), the author maintains that the appelation 'Al-Balkhi' most probably was applied outside Balkh, rather than in Balkh itself. The fragment published by Fleischer was discovered in the Genizah (and not in Balkh), and in all likelihood was written in Babylonia, the major center of Jewish culture at the time. BOOK REVIEW: BARUCH M. BOKSER, POST MISHNAIC JUDAISM IN TRANSITION, SAMUEL ON BERAKHOT AND THE BEGINNINGS OF GEMARA, 1980 by Eliezer Segal The study under review, a sequel to the author's previous work on the rest of Zera'im, examines the Amora Samuel's commentaries to the Mishnah tractate Berakhot. The first half of the book intelligently analyzes all the relevant texts, making ample use of medieval commentators, manuscripts and a variety of modern studies. Of particular interest are those instances in which the author carefully examines the syntactic formulation of Samuel's comments in order to determine which of a number of possible contexts was the original setting for the statement. In the second half of the book the author utilizes this corpus in order to prove his central thesis: that Samuel composed a commentary on the Mishnah. The reviewer feels that by confining himself to this one-sided thesis (which is in any case a commonly held view) Bokser has failed to pose a number of questions which should have been explored in a comprehensive study of Samuel's place in the transition between the Tannaitic and Amoraic eras, and has occasionally resorted to forced interpretations of the data in order to explain all of Samuel's statements as being inspired by the Mishnah. The value of this study thus lies in its insights into particular texts, rather than in its broader theoretical aims. BOOK REVIEW: IVAN G. MARCUS, PIETY AND SOCIETY. THE JEWISH PIETIST OF MEDIEVAL GERMANY, 1981 by Joseph Dan I. Marcus's study of the Ashkenazi Hasidic movement concentrates on an analysis of the teaching of Sefer Hasidim, 'The Book of the Pietists', which he compares and contrasts with the ethical and</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH SUMMARIES XIII social teachings of Rabbi Eleazar of Worms. Marcus succeeds in proving that there are significant differences between Rabbi Eleazar's individualistic system of ethics and repentance, and that of his teacher, Rabbi Judah the Pietist's system which emphasized social activity. Marcus is less successful in his attempt to prove that Rabbi Judah actually created pietistic groups and sects which followed his social theories and had significant impact in Germany in the 12th-13th centuries. It is more probable that the system presented in Sefer Hasidim was theoretical and remained so.</page></plain_text>
