I have argued that they "textually completed" this landscape through discussions of wildlife, flow ers, and notable features of the skies. In their capacities as travel writers the women searched for the unique, and discovered ample qualities of the region worth reporting. Positive re sponses to some aspects of the grassland land scape conform to the travel writer's ability (and need) to find value in strange and unfamiliar scenes. I have also argued that other positive interpretations of the prairies appeared in the text of Lady Rose Pender, a woman who expe rienced more intimate engagement with the land on her cattle roundup in Nebraska and Wyoming. Pender's domestic orientation com bined with her sense of freedom and well-be ing in the open country complements but also contrasts with what she may have perceived as constraining social roles for women in Vic torian England. Some writers focused their texts on the future development of agriculture for the re gion. The rhetoric of large-scale, capital-im proving progress for the grasslands existed in some of their narratives alongside that of a more protectionist perspective on other re gions of the west. While travelers such as Emily Faithful and Mrs. Vincent advocated turning the "useless" land of the central plains into productive agriculture, they and other writers were ambivalent over the inevitable despolia tion and destruction of aesthetically pleasing environments (such as the Rocky Mountains) that resulted from such development. The central interior of the continent was thus con structed as a place of profitable capitalist de velopment: a place primarily envisioned for what it could become, rather than what it was. Notes This research was supported by a grant from the Center for Great Plains Studies, and parts of it were first presented at the Center's 1992 "Ameri can Encounters" symposium. 1 would like to thank three anonymous referees, Jeanne Kay, Janice Monk, David Wishart, and Fran Kaye for reading and commenting on earlier drafts. I especially want to express my deep gratitude to Fran Kaye for all her insights on living and learning over the years; this work is warmly dedicated to her. 1.

Travelers in this study, like Hardy, typically departed on the western portions of their journeys at Chicago and then followed a transect across the West though Kansas City, Omaha, the central grass lands, Denver, the Rocky Mountains, Salt Lake City, the Sierra Nevadas, and finally reaching the Pacific at San Francisco. The travelogues typically follow the transect the railroad followed, with chap ters dated and titled chronologically and geographi cally east to west. A northerly or southerly leg was typically added to the travelers' journeys either going west or returning east. Lady Theodora Guest (1895), for instance, rode the Northern Pacific Railroad onto Vancouver Island and then crossed through Montana and Yellowstone Park and the northern Plains states before returning east. 3.

Parts of their texts are nearly identical, such as their descriptions of San Francisco's Chinatown (see Hardy, 1882, pp. 137-89 and Hardy, 1884, pp. 138-87). 7.

After Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation (London: Routledge, 1992), p. 171, I distinguish the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bourgeois era travelogue as an "autobiographical narrative." In this form, the writer herself is the narrative's protagonist; the texts combine events surrounding the protagonist with observational detail. The travelogues in this study are remarkably similar in form and itinerary. Most are introduced with elaborate frontispieces and characteristic lengthy and detailed tables of contents. They then proceed with descriptions of departures from British ports like Liverpool or from the author's entry into New York Harbor. They then continue chronologically and geographically (typically east to west) as the journey progresses. The subject matter of the narratives primarily re flects the route and destinations of railroad travel circa 1880 (see note 2 above). Though these books are similar in form, they do vary considerably in topics. Generally, all of the women wrote to some extent about American society and culture, scenic attractions, and hotel and train accommodations. But beyond that they concentrated more or less on an extensive range of American physical and cul tural landscapes. 9. I use the term "landscape," then, to incorpo rate both natural features of the earth as well as features that denote relationships between people and their material world. In this sense "landscape" is used as a more restrictive term than either "envi ronment" or "place" (after Janice Monk, "Ap proaches to the Study of Women and Landscape," Environmental Review 8 [1984]: 23-33.) There are other important features of the prairies and plains "landscape" that I have omitted from the present discussion because I have written of them else where, above all the aestheticized Native Ameri cans whom the women frequently encountered at train stations.

Richard White, in his "It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own": A History of the American West (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1991), pp. 216-20 reports that bison herds on the American plains probably peaked at about twenty five million, with about six to seven million in the southern herds in the mid nineteenth century, and three million as late as the 1870s. However, by 1875 the southern herd "had largely ceased to ex ist," due primarily to the industrial-style hunting of professional hide hunters who moved into the area. White reports that the most skilled hunters took 2,500 to 3,000 buffalo in a single year in the 1870s, inefficiently wasting most of their kill. "The slaughter was so thorough and quick that not even the hunters could believe what they had done" (219). By 1883 the northern herds had vanished as well. 30.

As previously discussed, however, travelers did occasionally note the differences between cul tivated and uncultivated land, especially with re spect to the dividing line between the prairies and plains at the Missouri River. Catherine Bates, for instance, asserted that "Iowa is much more green and fertile than Nebraska. There are plenty of trees there and good crops of wheat and Indian corn" (2:265). Similarly, F. D. Bridges stated that "[ljeaving Omaha ... we travelled all the way into Chicago through a rich country—'the golden belt'—a garden of Indian corn, and every kind of fruit and vegetable, with pretty farms, and even hedgerows—a strange sight to our eyes" (410). Lady Hardy also pointed to the presence of agricultural land west of the Missouri. After passing through 800 miles of "interminable desert land," signs of cultivation began to appear to Hardy in Kansas— signs of cattle, homesteads, and cultivated lands that were "blessed and refreshing" to her eyes (280). 40.
