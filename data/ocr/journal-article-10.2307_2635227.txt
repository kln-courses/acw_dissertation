The paper articulates a highly elaborate and insightful labeling framework. The paper draws on and integrates several diverse but interrelated theories and empirical findings. The relevance of the labeling framework and the labeling process is illustrated at the individual level (service encounters), group level (intergroup conflict) and organizational level (identity, image, and reputation). This highly original and eloquent paper should prove to be of great interest to the rapidly growing research community in managerial and organization cognition. Arie Y. Lewin Abstract Drawing on categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory, we argue that categories and labels are widely utilized by individuals in organizational settings to help structure and simplify the social environment, primarily for reasons of understanding, consensus, and control. Based largely on such situational criteria as role and rank, people are sorted into various categories and are perceived and treated as exem- plars or prototypes of the category. The labels attached to these categories coalesce when individuals triangulate their perceptions of category members with the perceptions that credible peers and powerholders have of category members. Labels distill a complex and perhaps contradictory array of data into concise and coherent packages, and thus provide a potent means of interpreting, representing, and conveying organizational experience and cuing action. However, labels are inherently arbitrary, labels cause individual category members to lose their individuality and assume the affective tone of the category, and labels tend to become reified as objective and normative accounts of social reality. The ubiq- uity and potency of labeling processes are illustrated with applications to individual-level (service encounters), group- level (intergroup conflict), and organization-level (identity, image, and reputation) phenomena. We speculate that both the process of labeling and the content of labels are similar across levels. (Labeling; Service Encounters; Intergroup Conflict; Identity) An emerging theme in organizational behavior is that organizations are interpretive structures or frameworks (Barley 1983, Daft and Weick 1984, Donnellon, Gray, and Bougon 1986, Fiol and Huff 1992). To act, an organizational member must come to some under- standing of what various social objects-actions, indi- viduals, events, groups, decisions, structures-mean within the organizational context. However, given the inherent ambiguity and multiple causes and forces act- ing on many social objects, meaning is elusive. Accord- ingly, meaning has been described as socially con- structed and symbolically mediated as individuals at- tempt to resolve ambiguity by triangulating on a more or less shared interpretation of organizational experi- ence. We argue that a critical vehicle for interpreting, organizing, and communicating experience within orga- nizations and, in turn, for guiding experience, is the label. As discussed below, a label is a signifier of a given object, and typically activates a set of cognitions (and related affect) about the object. Thus, to the extent that specific labels and cognitions are shared, labels constitute a parsimonious means of understand- ing and communicating about an object. As illustrated in the paper, labels have a profound effect on how organizational members conceive of social objects and on how they act toward those objects. 1047-7039/97/0801/0043/$01.25 Copyright ? 1997.

HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations By contrasting categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory we develop an integrative framework on labeling processes that is richer and more compre- hensive than these theories considered in isolation. We argue that categorization theory details the process of constructing meaning, that semiotics focuses on the process of communicating meaning, and that labeling theory provides the social context for these processes. Thus, the paper outlines the process of constructing and communicating the meaning of social objects in an orga- nizational context. We illustrate the ubiquity and po- tency of labeling in organizations by applying this pro- cess framework to individual-level (service encounters), group-level (intergroup relations), and organization- level (identity, image, reputation) phenomena. Our labeling framework extends previous theorizing on organizations as interpretive structures in three ways. First, it sheds light on the origin of socially constructed meaning by contrasting the role of the individual, social referents, and powerholders, as em- bodied in categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory. Second, it articulates the major purposes, major tenets, and central themes of labeling as a sense-mak- ing process by juxtaposing these three theories. Third, it provides insights on how the organizational context affects sense-making by applying the labeling frame- work to issues drawn from three different levels of analysis. Categorization Theory, Semiotics, and Labeling Theory The major contributions of categorization theory, semi- otics, and labeling theory to our integrative framework are summarized in Table 1. The descriptions of catego- rization theory and labeling theory are adapted from Ashforth and Humphrey (1995). Categorization Theory: The Process of Constructing Meaning This perspective focuses on how one defines objects. As a psychological theory, it is largely concerned with the role that cognition plays in perception, memory, inference, and so on. Categorization theory maintains that the general function of categories is to simplify and help order the environment, including the social environment (Corter and Gluck 1992). Given the cog- nitive efficiency and ready availability of social cate- gories (e.g., gender, inferred attributes, jobs), per- ceivers have a propensity to use categories as a basis for perception (Lambert and Wyer 1990). The criteria for categorization may be based on the perceived distinctiveness, salience, accessibility, affec- tive importance, or utility of the category. The cate- gories to which social objects are assigned are pre- sumed by the perceiver to provide reliable and valid information about an object. This is because catego- Table 1 Categorization Theory, Semiotics, and Labeling Theory: An Integrative Framework Categorization Labeling Theory Semiotics Theory Major purpose of categorizing / signifying / labeling: To facilitate one's understanding o To facilitate communication and shared perception o To facilitate social control o Major tenets: Meaning is ambiguous o o o Meaning is a function of one's perception o Meaning is a function of shared significations o Meaning is a function of power and authority o Central themes (implicit and explicit): Categories / signifiers / labels: * are inherently arbitrary .o o 1o * cause targets to lose their individuality o o o * cause targets to assume a certain affective tone o o o * tend to become reified o o o Note: A checkmark denotes that the statement applies to the relevant theory. 44 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997</page><page sequence="3">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations rization activates a schema or set of cognitions about the members of the category (Fiske, Neuberg, Beattie, and Milberg 1987). A schema is based on a prototype (i.e., an abstraction of the most widely shared at- tributes of category members) and/or exemplars (i.e., specific members who exemplify the category). Proto- types are abstract, whereas exemplars are concrete. Thus, one's "popular coworker" schema may consist of such characteristics as friendliness, helpfulness, and competence, and/or be represented by specific coworkers. Fiske and Neuberg (1990) present a comprehensive model of how category-based perceptions are formed. They argue that to the extent social categories convey well-learned schemas, they require less cognitive effort than individuated perceptions. Thus, a perceiver's first impressions are reflexively based on the category or categories to which a social object is assigned. A cus- tomer may be categorized as a "big spender" because he or she is perceived to have some characteristics thought to be prototypical of big spenders, or to more or less match an exemplar of big spending. If the perceiver has sufficient motivation, time, and informa- tion, then he or she will attend to additional cues. These cues may confirm the initial categorization or trigger a search for an alternative categorization or a subcategorization. However, once an object is catego- rized, the perceiver tends to interpret remaining ambi- guity so as to support the categorization, and may overlook or discount contradictory information (Ham- ilton, Sherman, and Ruvolo 1990). If the perceiver is unable to confirm a categorization and still has suffi- cient motivation and time, then he or she will attempt to integrate the available information in a more piece- meal fashion. Category information continues to be used throughout this sequence: even in piecemeal im- pression formation, the perceived meaning of a given piece of information (e.g., well dressed) often derives from the generalized schema that the perceiver at- taches to that piece. Semiotics: The Process of Communicating Meaning Whereas categorization theory focuses on how one perceives objects, semiotics focuses on how one com- municates these perceptions. Thus, semiotics comple- ments categorization theory by suggesting how percep- tions come to be shared. Semiotics is essentially the study of signs (Pierce 1931-58, Saussure 1966). As an eclectic field, a unified theory of semiotics does not yet exist. Following Barley (1983), we will gloss over incon- sistencies and present the major tenets. According to semiotics, communication occurs through the use of codes. A code consists of a set of expressions, a set of contents, rules for pairing expressions and contents, and a set of responses to a given pairing (Eco 1976). Expressions symbolize or signify the contents, and so are referred to as "signifiers." The contents, as the thing symbolized, are referred to as the "signified." Thus, the term "Accountant" (the signifier) refers to an occupational group performing a certain function (the signified). A signifier gains meaning through its associ- ation with the signified and the set of cognitions this evokes. The term Accountant derives its meaning from its connection with individuals who prepare financial statements and the schemas attached to these individu- als. Thus, the term Accountant might evoke certain expectations about how the person will behave and how one should respond to him or her. Using a signifier as a shorthand means of describing an object requires the audience to reconstruct the speaker's intent by invoking their own knowledge. Sig- nifiers cue the particular set of cognitions that should be used to make sense of the object. Thus, communi- ties and cultures are characterized by more or less shared codes for interpreting social objects. Finally, the code dictates appropriate behaviors and attitudes to- ward the social object. Thus, a shared code engenders similar responses from different individuals. Labeling Theory: The Social Context for Constructing and Communicating Meaning Categorization theory and to a lesser extent, semiotics, generally ignore the social context within which mean- ing is constructed and transmitted. Categorization the- ory evolved largely from laboratory studies of subjects working independently of one another. Experimenters were concerned with the physical context surrounding the presentation of stimuli insofar as it affected such perceptual phenomena as contrast and grouping; the social context was implicitly viewed as an extraneous factor to be controlled. Clearly, however, individuals in organizations are embedded in a social system: they occupy roles, are members of groups, are expected to perform tasks, and are located in networks of author- ity, friendship, and communication. Consequently, one's perceptions and actions invariably reflect the surround- ing organizational context. Labeling theory complements categorization theory and semiotics by emphasizing the role of the social context, although it does not provide an explicit theo- retical framework for analyzing the impact of the con- text. Labeling theory focuses primarily on how institu- tions and social control agents define social objects, ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997 45</page><page sequence="4">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations principally individuals and their acts. As a sociological theory, it is largely concerned with the role that author- ity, status, and power play in the assignment of social identities to individuals. Like semiotics, labeling "theory" is more an eclectic perspective than a coherent theory. It developed largely from the sociological literature on deviance (Tannen- baum 1938) and mental illness (Scheff 1984), perhaps because law enforcement and medical diagnoses are inherently interpretive processes where individuals must make complex decisions in the face of ambiguity and often conflicting social goals (rehabilitation vs. control). Following symbolic interactionism, labeling theorists argue that the meaning of a given social object is inherently ambiguous and becomes con- structed via social processes (Becker 1973, Erikson 1966). Through interaction and the triangulation of views, observers attach labels to social objects and thus render the social environment comprehensible. In emphasizing the social context, labeling theory also emphasizes the possibility of various motives for labeling. In categorization theory, the motive is as- sumed to be greater understanding of the environment. The ambiguity of social stimuli suggests a critical need for definition. Categorization processes enable one to navigate an otherwise confusing and complex world. In contrast, given their interest in power differences, la- beling theorists generally contend that a primary mo- tive for labeling is social control. The very ambiguity of stimuli raises the question of whose definition should prevail. As our organizational applications will demon- strate, definitions frequently have major consequences for the parties involved. Indeed, many labeling theo- rists argue that powerholders use labels to selectively assign negatively-valued social identities such as "de- linquent" and "poor credit risk" to those whom they disfavor and, conversely, to assign positively-valued identities to those whom they prefer. This selectivity legitimates the imposition of differential patterns of constraint and opportunity and thereby perpetuates the cosmology and power of the authorities (Becker 1973, Scheff 1984). Thus, while categorization theory focuses on how the act of definition facilitates compre- hension, labeling, theory focuses on how definition facilitates control. These motives, of course, are not mutually exclusive. An Integrative Framework for Labeling According to all three perspectives, meaning is inher- ently ambiguous and thus must be imposed on stimuli. The perspectives agree that categories/signifiers/ labels are utilized to structure the social environment and thereby resolve ambiguity. While categories consti- tute the classification system into which stimuli are grouped, signifiers and labels constitute the tags used to designate the categories. Social objects become identified with the categories to which they are as- signed and the signifiers and labels that flag their assignment. (Thus, we will regard the terms "label" and "signifier" as interchangeable.) The Source of Meaning. However, the three perspec- tives have different views on the source of meaning. In categorization theory, meaning is a function of one's perceptions; in semiotics, a function of shared signifi- cations; and in labeling theory, a function of power and authority. However, we do not regard these views as inconsistent: rather, they reflect different ontological stances toward the same fundamental question. Each stance is like a facet of a prism, providing a different reflection of reality. Thus, by integrating these perspec- tives, we can gain a fuller and more robust model of the process of constructing and communicating mean- ing in organizational settings. Figure 1 provides an overview of this integration. Our integration starts with the individual perceiver ("I see"). Because of its distinctly psychological per- spective on sense-making, this is clearly the realm of categorization theory. The theory focuses on the direct link between perceiver and target. Although catego- rization theorists recognize that contextual factors influence this linkage, the factors they examine are generally physical in nature rather than social. For example, Taylor, Crocker, Fiske, Sprinzen, and Winkler (1979) demonstrated how contextual factors such as seating arrangement make a person more salient and Figure 1 Integrating Three Perspectives on the Genesis of Meaning POWERHOLDERS Labeling Theory; "They Sec" |INDIVIDUAL |SOCIALl PERCEPTIONS REFERENTS Categorization Thcoi y: Scmiolics "I See" (Laiheling Theory)": "We Sec" Note: The white arrow heads denote the weaker power of individu- als and their social referents vis-a-vis powerholders. aLabeling Theory is in parentheses because the role of social referents is a focal point of the symbolic interactionist tradition from which Labeling Theory derives. 46 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997</page><page sequence="5">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations cause him or her to be rated in more extreme terms. This emphasis on physical factors has overshadowed social system factors. Conversely, labeling theory has focused primarily on social system factors and has generally ignored other factors that influence person perception. Thus, an integration of labeling theory and categorization theory should better explain both types of contextual influences on the process of sense- making. Labeling theory, together with semiotics, suggests that the impact of the social system is largely mediated through-: (1) social referents ("We see"); in organiza- tions, typically one's peers, and (2) powerholders ("They see"); in organizations, typically hierarchical authori- ties, experts, and informal leaders. The symbolic inter- actionist tradition from which labeling theory derives maintains that, given the ambiguity of stimuli, one's solitary perceptions are inherently uncertain and un- stable. Accordingly, one seeks to construct and validate perceptions through interaction with others who are deemed sufficiently trustworthy (i.e., social referents and, possibly, powerholders). An object becomes mean- ingful-is accredited with meaning-when observers successfully triangulate their perceptions and attain a reasonable degree of consensus. Thus, meaning is cre- ated and sustained through interaction (Blumer 1969). Semiotics adds that shared significations are an index of consensus. However, neither semiotics nor labeling theory provide an explicit account of how social refer- ents and powerholders affect the perception of social objects in organizational settings. Role of Social Referents and Powerholders. Complex organizations tend to be highly differentiated systems, with individual members organized into various group- ings, roles, and relationships. These linkages function as the pivot for the process of sense-making, bridging the interface between organization and individual. Thus, both one's peers and leaders are apt to be highly salient social actors. Peers derive largely from one's primary group membership, where primary group is defined as the group with which one most frequently interacts and the group through which others interact with one (Kramer 1991). Given that task interdepen- dencies and interpersonal proximity are greater within the primary group, and that task and interpersonal differentiation are greater between than within such groups, one tends to view primary group peers as relatively credible social referents, and comes to inter- act and socially construct meaning with them. Thus, the arrow in Figure 1 linking the individual perceiver and social referents is double-headed. The critical role that social referents play in sense-making is a recurring theme in various models of social influence, including social comparison theory, social learning theory, and social information processing theory. Of course, primary groups do not operate in a social vacuum. A major task of senior management is to create and maintain a system of shared meanings to provide a basis for coordinated behavior (Daft and Weick 1984, Smircich and Stubbart 1985). Managers shape and frame experience, suggesting patterns, causal sequences, and interpretations. Through action and interaction, they help individuals and their groups con- verge on common understandings. Labeling theorists argue, however, that this enactment is not passive or altruistic: it is motivated by a desire for control. As noted, the powerful are said to selectively assign desir- able and undesirable labels to those whom they favor and disfavor. The imprimatur of authority legitimates and institutionalizes the labels. Thus, because labels are said to be imposed, Figure 1 shows arrows from powerholders to both individual perceptions and social referents. Additionally, although labeling theory does not consider such influence, research in other organi- zational domains indicates that individuals and groups can affect the perceptions and behaviors of powerhold- ers (Boeker 1989, Schriesheim and Hinkin 1990). Thus, Figure 1 also shows white arrowheads from both indi- vidual perceptions and social referents to powerhold- ers. The white arrowheads denote the weaker power and influence of individuals and groups vis-a-vis power- holders. Thus, categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory collectively suggest that meaning in organiza- tions is symbolically mediated and socially constructed; that is, that one's perceptions of social objects are grounded in the perceptions of social referents and powerholders and are represented by abstract schema. More specifically, social objects are partitioned into categories that are identified by labels-a process we will refer to simply as "labeling." Labeling serves as a means of retrospectively interpreting, organizing, and communicating about objects, and prospectively acting toward them. The locus of social construction is a meld of peer interaction and leader enactment. Central Themes Four themes that are particularly relevant to the pro- cess of sense-making in an organizational context are implicit or explicit in the literatures on categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory. 1. Labeling is Inherently Arbitrary. All three perspec- tives hold that because stimuli are inherently equivocal, ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997 47</page><page sequence="6">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations a perceptual framework must be imposed. Thus, there is no necessary correspondence between a given social object and a given label: labels are an outcome of attempts to understand and to control, not an empiri- cal truth awaiting discovery. This theme is most clearly articulated by semiotics. In semiotics, the pairing of an expression with a set of contents is arbitrary in the sense that there may be no inherent connection between the two: a given expres- sion may signify different contents, and similar con- tents may be signified by different expressions. The label of "leader" may signify a charismatic and support- ive person who focuses on consensus building or a stiff and aloof person who focuses on autocratic decision making. Indeed, because the pairing of signifier and signified is arbitrary, individuals must share the code to share understanding. Labeling theory adds that because meaning is so- cially mediated, the perceived clarity and certainty of meaning is a function of consensus more so than the properties of the social object in question. Ambiguity is resolved retrospectively through social influence such that perceived attributes are an outcome of labeling rather than a cause. Finally, categorization theory adds that the assignment of social objects to categories is largely a function of one's perceptual set and is af- fected by systematic error due to cognitive heuristics, extant schemas, and contextual biases. A person dis- playing risque humor during job interviews may be branded as cocky by one company and personable by another, and yet both companies might be quite confi- dent in their assessment. 2. Labeling Causes Social Objects to Lose Their Indi- viduality. Once labeled, objects tend to be perceived in terms of the schema affixed to the label. Their idiosyn- crasies become hidden by the generic cognitions. Moreover, schemas can be viewed as stereotypes be- cause they summarize the qualities thought to charac- terize the group or key exemplars (Hamilton et al. 1990). In short, schemas deindividuate category mem- bers. A schema may be accurate or inaccurate, simple or complex, and specific or general. However, even where a schema is accurate at the aggregate level (e.g., popular coworkers are more competent than unpopu- lar ones), it may not be accurate for a given individual. Thus, perceiving a labeled social object via the schema attached to the label often fosters misconceptions. 3. Labeling Causes Social Objects to Assume the Affec- tive Tone of the Category. Categorization theory main- tains that categories and their schemas are associated with "affective tags," such that a label may quickly elicit positive, neutral, or negative affect (Fiske and Pavelchak 1986). When a social object is categorized, it adopts the affective tone of the category. Moreover, the affective tags associated with social objects in orga- nizational settings often elicit very intense affect. First, as noted, individuals are lodged in more or less stable role sets, groups, and networks, entailing ongoing in- teraction with certain people. This history of interac- tion fosters affect: it is difficult to remain indifferent to a person or group that one comes to know. Thus, affect tends to polarize over time. Indeed, even ambivalent attitudes are characterized not by the absence of affect but by fluctuations in positive and negative affect. Second, social objects often have direct implications for such critical issues as performance, identity, status, acceptance, and extrinsic rewards. This criticality fos- ters affect: it is also difficult to remain indifferent to a person or group that mediates the attainment of valued outcomes. For example, individuals often have very strong feelings (whether positive or negative) about senior management, particularly their immediate supe- rior. 4. Labels Tend to Become Reified as Objective and. Normative Accounts of Social Reality. Individuals come to view their labels and schemas as a reliable and valid mirror of reality, as simply reflecting what is "out there." Thus, labels become institutionalized in the sense meant by Zucker (1977), that is, as objective and exte- rior accounts of reality that are resistant to change. This argument is evident in all three perspectives. Categorization theory notes that the act of classifica- tion creates expectancies which the perceiver may "see"): patterns may be imposed that support the classi- fication and schema-consistent attributes may be re- called that do not exist (Hamilton et al. 1990). These perceptions then provide the basis for inferences about the object, which are also stored as "knowledge." Fur- ther, these processes may lead to both a cognitive confirmation effect (Darley and Gross 1983) where in- formation is reworked to sustain existing beliefs, and a behavioral confirmation effect (Snyder and Swann 1978) where the perceiver's actions create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Finally, given task specialization, repeated exposure to stimulus cues results in the development of well-learned categories and schema, and the automatic activation of both (Smith and Lerner 1986). Like categorization theorists, labeling theorists argue that the imposition of a label sets in motion forces that validate the label. However, labeling theory helps vest 48 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vol. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997</page><page sequence="7">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations this argument in specific, ongoing social contexts. A label applied to a given act (e.g., a simple but costly mistake) may generalize to the actor (incompetent), such that he or she is seen as someone likely to perform more such acts. Accordingly, others may at- tempt to prevent this from occurring (assigning simple tasks), constraining the actor's latitude for disproving the label. Ultimately, the actor may internalize the social cues and define himself or herself in terms of the label (I am incompetent) and commit the very act that was ascribed to him or her. Finally, semiotics adds that because the codes for deriving meaning are shared and routinely invoked, they tend to assume a normative quality. Thus, through consensus and familiarity, these habits of seeing come to define the way a prudent perceiver "should" see social objects. Once a perception is anchored by values, it becomes very resistant to change. Summary Our labeling framework can be summarized as follows. Because the meaning of social objects is inherently ambiguous, meaning is derived from the triangulation of perceptions and the enactments of powerholders. This meaning is signified or crystallized in the form of labels and their attendant schemas. Labels thus facili- tate understanding, shared perception and communica- tion, and social control. However, because meaning is socially constructed, labels are a function of the pro- cess of construction as much as the properties of the object. Once labeled, objects tend to be perceived as exemplars of the label rather than as unique entities. Further, labels tend to become reified as objective accounts of reality and become self-fulfilling. The discussion has thus far been rather abstract. In the remainder of the paper, the labeling framework is applied to organizational issues. This serves three pur- poses: (1) it grounds the framework in specific exam- ples, thereby illustrating the major purposes, major tenets, and central themes listed in Table 1, (2) it demonstrates how the framework underlies several otherwise diverse literatures, thereby illustrating the ubiquity and potency of labeling in organizations, and (3) it suggests certain extensions to the basic labeling framework, which are summarized in the form of propositions. We examine how labeling processes are commonly used to interpret and communicate about three levels of analysis: individuals (vis-a-vis service encounters), groups (vis-a-vis intergroup relations), and organizations per se (vis-a-vis identity, image, and rep- utation). These applications reflect situations where there is considerable ambiguity and perhaps conflict about the choice of labels, and where the choice has significant consequences for the parties involved. Labeling of Individuals: Service Encounters Service encounters provide a clear example of labeling as a means of sense-making. Service encounters are important because service agents, as boundary span- ners, effectively represent the organization to clients- and many encounters begin with the perception of clients by agents, usually during face-to-face interac- tions. Further, given the uncertainty caused by client participation in many transactions, service quality is often highly dependent upon how agents perceive and subsequently behave toward clients (Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry 1990). Yet the literature on service encounters has not systematically assessed how service agents socially construct clients, focusing in- stead on such topics as service delivery systems (e.g., technology, formalization), agents' control and impres- sion management tactics, and clients' perceptions of service (Czepiel, Solomon, and Surprenant 1985). The labeling framework sheds light on the process through which clients are constructed. Following Fiske and Neuberg's (1990) model of category-based impres- sion formation, presented earlier, a service agent, like any perceiver, will have a natural tendency to rely upon categorical information in constructing the client. Also, the agent will tend to interpret ambiguous and incon- sistent information so as to confirm an initial label, and to both think about and act toward the client in a manner that confirms the label. Perhaps this is why experienced role occupants and experts are frequently found to have "jumped to conclusions" and displayed overconfidence in their decisions (Ashforth and Fried 1988). Thus, Spradley and Mann (1975) found that cocktail waitresses quickly and routinely categorized people entering a bar (as, for example, regulars, loners, businessmen), and then acted on the basis of the schemas attached to the categories. It should be re- membered, however, that a service agent can override these tendencies if he or she is motivated and has the attentional resources to perceive individuating at- tributes in order to form a more accurate view of the client. Note that since the agent tends to be motivated to confirm a categorization, it is not sufficient to induce him or her to simply devote more time to the client. Extensions to the Labeling Framework A review of the literature on service encounters sug- gests several extensions to our basic labeling frame- ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997 49</page><page sequence="8">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations work. First, the tendency to quickly categorize and then confirm the categorization is likely exacerbated by task constraints. The literature indicates that service personnel are most likely to rely upon categorical in- formation when the task is complex, control is limited, the clients are numerous and heterogeneous, and the duration of interaction is short (Mennerick 1974, Waegel 1981). This is consistent with laboratory re- search that indicates that tasks performed under diffi- cult circumstances, such as heavy workload or time constraints, or that require weighing complex and di- verse information, invite the use of cognitive heuristics (Bodenhausen and Lichtenstein 1987, Fiske 1993). Thus, the themes of arbitrariness, deindividuation, af- fective tone, and reification are apt to become more apparent precisely when more subtle perceptions may be required. Labeling theorists stress how labels are often applied arbitrarily to individuals. As categorization theory im- plies, part of this arbitrariness is undoubtedly due to the way in which task demands and limitations on information processing create inaccurate perceptions. By analyzing the task demands inherent in different positions, it may be possible to predict with greater accuracy how individuals will be labeled (Humphrey and Ashforth 1994). Second, the theme of labeling as deindividuation is likely to be problematic only in certain situations; specifically, when service quality depends upon recog- nizing and acting upon the unique demands and id- iosyncrasies of a client. The need for an individuated response is probably a function of the diversity, com- plexity, and instability of a client's demands. Simply put, the less predictable the demands, the less ade- quate is a categorical perception and a schema-driven or standardized response. Thus, categorical percep- tions may be quite adequate for meeting the simple demands of most transactions in fast food restaurants, banks, and theaters. The efficiency afforded by the labeling process allows the service agent to quickly anticipate and respond to a client's needs. Conversely, individuated perceptions are more important for such potentially complicated services as medical care, edu- cation, and legal advice (cf. Larsson and Bowen 1989). Humphrey, Ashforth, and Thomas (1993) found that insurance agents who were better able to assess their clients' expressive behavior and respond accordingly had higher incomes and job satisfaction. Thus, poor service quality may often reflect the inappropriate, but relatively automatic, application of more or less innate labeling tendencies. An initial categorization may guide subsequent interaction and perception such that a service agent becomes unable to recast the client. A service agent may lack the neces- sary motivation or resources to make relatively fine- grained distinctions between clients. Further, consis- tent with the theme of labeling as reification, clients may not be able to break out of stereotypic identities, particularly if their power is disproportionately low (e.g., teacher vs. student, police officer vs. citizen). Sequential Service Encounters. Most of the literature on categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory pertains to a one-time construction of meaning. Thus, a third extension to our labeling framework concerns the use of multiple, sequential perceivers. In complex organizations with segmented work flows and task spe- cialization, like hospitals and social agencies, sequen- tial service encounters are often the norm. Consistent with labeling as a means to shared per- ception, we argue that the service agent who initially encounters a client may determine how other agents regard the client. First, initial encounters serve a gate- keeping function, as agents collect information about the client and communicate it to others as input for further processing. Thus, service agents must edit and filter information and neatly define the client. This "communication mindset encourages the use of cate- gories and abstractions, in effect making would-be communicators less complex and less data driven than people who do not expect to communicate" (Fiske 1993:176). Second, a further effect of this selectivity is that others downstream often lack the necessary infor- mation to form their own conclusions. Third, standard- ized procedures and forms for reporting such informa- tion are typically geared toward efficiency, and so cannot convey the richness and complexity of idiosyn- cratic perceptions. Hospital admission forms and cus- tomer complaint reports consolidate reams of qualita- tive data and subjective impressions into a limited number of preset categories. Finally, others are likely to take the judgments of gatekeepers at face value to avoid conflict. Thus, organizational members are in- clined to accept prior labels as given and to act accord- ingly. Hence, an initial and perhaps tentative label may build momentum as it cycles through the organization, becoming reified as a social fact. Roth (1972) found that registration clerks in hospital emergency wards frequently used criteria that were irrelevant to the task (e.g., dress, speech, marital status) as a basis for cate- gorizing patients, and that these categories strongly affected the quality of treatment that patients received. Organizations with poor service reputations often re- 50 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997</page><page sequence="9">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations flexively disparage clients who are critical of their products and practices, thus undermining the credibil- ity of the clients' concerns (Danet 1981). Indeed, con- sistent with the notion of labeling as a means of social control, derogatory labels are often used to preserve the status quo. Finally, Walsh (1990) reports that psy- chiatrists' evaluations of the mental fitness of defen- dants was influenced by the criminal charge against them and that these evaluations (all else equal) influ- enced the punitiveness of the recommendations of probation officers and the sentences of judges. The initial charge acted as a label, triggering a self-fulfilling prophency through a series of decisions that were supposedly independent. In sum, the application of the labeling framework to service encounters suggests that service agents confront a natural tendency to initially categorize clients and then think about and act toward them in ways that merely confirm the categorization. Moreover, such cat- egorizations tend to become more automatic with ex- perience. Our discussion of extensions to the labeling framework suggests three propositions: PROPOSITION 1. The tendency of label social objects will be exacerbated by task constraints. PROPOSITION 2. The tendency to label social objects will only be problematic to the extent that a task requires an individuated response to an object. PROPOSITION 3. In sequential encounters with social objects, the individual who first encounters the object will tend to play the most important role in the labeling of the object. Labeling of Groups: Intergroup Relations Social categories and labels are inherently group-level constructs because they imply that certain individuals share a common identity. In this section we extend the integrative framework to the group level of analysis by discussing how groups in organizations are labeled and the effects of these labels on intergroup processes. Consistent with labeling as a means of understand- ing, categorization theory maintains that categories are selected to be diagnostic. That is, categories distinguish between possible aggregations of individuals on criteria that are useful to the task at hand (Fiske 1993). Typi- cally, these criteria reflect relatively large between- group differences and relatively small within-group dif- ferences. Clearly, there are many potential criteria for categorizing individuals into groups, and many criteria overlap (Stangor, Lynch, Duan, and Glass 1992). Fre- quently used personal criteria include demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, race), physical attrac- tiveness, and inferred attributes (e.g., ambitious, friendly). In organizations, of course, individuals not only have personal attributes but situational attributes. As noted earlier, complex organizations tend to be highly differ- entiated systems. Differentiation provides numerous situational criteria for categorizing individuals, such as occupation, department, workgroup, and hierarchical level. Given that organizations are also goal-oriented systems, it is obviously useful to know the various functions, capacities, and locations of organizational members, as denoted by the situational criteria. Thus, the various bases of differentiation provide an expedi- ent and valuable means of categorizing members. Moreover, Schneider's (1987) attraction-selection- attrition model suggests that personal and situational attributes often covary. Schneider argues that an orga- nization tends to attract and select people with certain personal attributes and tends to lose people who do not match this profile. Further, organizations and oc- cupational subgroups tend to socialize people such that they become more alike (Van Maanen 1976). Thus, personal criteria are often nested within situational criteria. This suggests that labeling processes in organiza- tional settings will be predicated largely (but not en- tirely) upon situational criteria, as embodied in the formal and informal bases of structural differentiation. The ascribed social identity of the individual will be a function largely of the groups to which he or she is perceived to actually or symbolically belong. Extensions to the Labeling Framework A review of the intergroup relations literature suggests a critical refinement of the labeling framework: the process of constructing others also constructs oneself. Social identity theory maintains that the meaning of categories is "relational and comparative" (Tajfel and Turner 1986, p. 16) in that meaning derives in part from comparisons between categories. For example, the category of manager derives much of its meaning from its relation to the category of worker. Thus, in defining others in terms of categories, individuals si- multaneously define themselves. Further, consistent with labeling as deindividuation, this "self-labeling" induces individuals to adopt the characteristics thought to be prototypical of their fellow category members (Turner and Oakes 1989). ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997 51</page><page sequence="10">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations This suggests that perceivers may, perhaps uncon- sciously, label others so as to sharpen the contrast between themselves and others and thus enhance their self-image (Hogg and Abrams 1990). Following the theme of affective tone, labels may be utilized precisely because of their evaluative connotations. Hazan (1992) discusses how active residents in an old-age home labeled their less active peers as "vegetables" and ''animals" to clearly demarcate themselves from the others and thus fortify their own sense of vitality. Indeed, given unspoken insecurities about their vitality, Hazan found this derogation was "total and uncompro- mising" (p. 28). The tendency to implicate the self in the labeling of others is consistent with laboratory research that indicates that category prototypes tend to differ in self-serving ways: individuals are more in- clined to ascribe socially desirable attributes to groups in which they categorize themselves, and to ascribe socially undesirable attributes to other groups (Schaller 1991). Together, the use of structural differentiation as a basis for categorization and the use of categorization as a basis for self-image enhancement, help account for the prevalence in organizations of derogatory stereo- types tied to structural groupings (e.g., line vs. staff, manager vs. worker). Derogating others implicitly ele- vates one's own status. A related extension suggested by the intergroup lit- erature is that labeling processes may create conflict between perceivers and social objects. Given the "rela- tional and comparative" nature of social categories and the desire for self-image enhancement, perceivers are likely to not only perceive flattering differences be- tween themselves and otherwise similar, proximal, or salient "outgroups," but to seek such differences. Thus, laboratory and field research indicates that: ... groups are willing to sacrifice large monetary gains that do not establish a positive difference between groups for smaller gains that do..., that in-group members adopt more extreme positions after comparison with an out-group than with fellow in-group members..., and that members prefer and selec- tively recall information that suggests intergroup differences rather than similarities (Ashforth and Mael 1989, p. 31). As suggested, a salutary self-label is fostered by differentiating one's own social category or "ingroup" from the outgroup(s) and disparaging the latter on this basis. Indeed, Johnston and Hewstone (1990) cite evi- dence that the more similar the ingroup is to the outgroup, the greater is the ingroup bias. Thus, groups may claim to be positively differentiated precisely be- cause they are not (Ashforth and Mael 1989). The stereotypical perceptions and negative attitudes fos- tered by the ingroup bias may, under certain condi- tions, provoke and justify hostility toward the outgroup. Moreover, this process is particularly likely to occur if the ingroup's identity is threatened or insecure, since it may restore collective esteem (Branscombe and Wann 1992). This suggests that much intergroup conflict re- sults from the simple fact that social categories are seen to exist, and may occur even in the absence of "objective" sources of conflict such as scarce resources or discrepant goals. Finally, consistent with labeling as reification, inter- group conflict and the pejorative labels which sustain it are likely to become habitual over time. As noted, it requires a conscious effort not to automatically utilize a well-learned category. Even if one disavows the util- ity of a category, the presence of a cue may automati- cally activate the schema such that one unconsciously responds to others as exemplars of the disavowed cate- gory. Devine (1989) found that even among subjects who honestly reported having no negative attitudes against blacks, the stimulus cue of race automatically primed common racial stereotypes and a biased inter- pretation of ambiguous behavior. It was only when the perceiver was consciously aware of the racial cue that he or she was able to discount the stereotype and not act in a prejudiced manner. Thus, in keeping with labeling as deindividuation, it takes a deliberate effort to perceive a given outgroup member as an individual and not merely as an extension of his or her group. That good intentions are not sufficient attests to the power of labels. In sum, because categories are inherently group level constructs, the labeling framework can be applied readily to intergroup relations. Although categorization theory and labeling theory typically focus on personal criteria as the basis for grouping individuals, our review suggests that in organizations the structural bases of differentiation provide situational criteria that often subsume personal criteria. Moreover, because labeling often implicates the perceiver's self-concept (via con- trast), perceivers are not neutral participants in the process of constructing and communicating labels. Our discussion suggests two propositions: PROPOSITION 4. Labeling in organizational settings tends to be based more on situational criteria than per- sonal criteria. PROPOSITION 5. To the extent that the labeling of others provides a salient comparison to the perceiver's sense of self, (a) labels will be selected to enhance the self-image of the perceiver, and (b) the process of labeling may cause intergroup conflict. 52 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vo1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997</page><page sequence="11">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations Labeling of Organizations: Identity, Image, and Reputation The labeling framework can be applied to the organi- zational level of analysis because organizations per se can be viewed as social categories. Indeed, organiza- tional theorists have paid increasing attention to how an organization qua organization is conceptualized by individuals and groups internal and external to the organization. Albert and Whetten (1985) defined "organizational identity" as the central, enduring, and distinctive character of the organization as perceived by organizational members, Dutton and Dukerich (1991) viewed "organizational image" as the way that members perceive that others see the organization's identity, and Fombrun and Shanley (1990) defined ''organizational reputation" as the relative standing or status accorded an organization by its stakeholders. Our labeling framework suggests how and why an organization's identity, image, reputation, or other typi- fications come to matter. Such terms refer to more or less concise and potent signifiers of the organization. As such, they selectively distill a complex jumble of otherwise ambiguous and contradictory activities, pro- nouncements, and impressions into a simplified and relatively coherent portrait. Indeed, Albert and Whet- ten (1985) propose that a felt need for a clearly articu- lated organizational identity is greatest when ambiguity is high. Labels such as "innovative manufacturer," "fis- cally responsible," "fair employer," and "good corpo- rate citizen" succinctly embody what the organization means-or is hoped or intended to mean-to individu- als and groups. An organizational label contributes to the more or less shared code for conceiving of and discussing an inherently nebulous and diffuse entity. Thus, as Ritti and Silver (1986:41) argue, social actors may pursue certain "ritual classifications," the benefit of which "is to make conclusions self-evident that otherwise might be difficult or risky to prove." We argued earlier that the major purposes of label- ing include understanding, shared perception, social control, and-from the intergroup perspective-self- image enhancement. These rather abstract functions are given concrete expression in the literatures on identity, image, and reputation. Specifically, this litera- ture suggests that an organizational label may simulta- neously serve as: (1) a rhetorical device for imparting a desired vision of the organization, (2) a frame for interpreting the meaning and importance of events, (3) a means of cuing certain decisions and actions, and (4) an identity tag for defining organizational members. Two recent studies illustrate this argument. First, Thomas and Gioia (1992) describe how university exec- utives conceived of their school as a potential "Top 10 public university." This label helped galvanize interest in-and focused attention on-radical change efforts to upgrade the institution. Further, by cuing the proto- typical attributes ascribed to top universities, the label provided a framework for formulating strategic plans to attain these attributes. Second, Dutton and Duk- erich (1991) discuss how the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey dealt with the presence of home- less people in their transportation facilities. They found that the identity of the organization as a can-do techni- cal expert with a commitment to quality and public service strongly affected whether aspects of the home- lessness issue were interpreted as moral concerns, busi- ness concerns, or concerns to be ignored, whether subsequent actions evoked positive or negative emo- tions from members, and it affected "guidelines for evaluating success, recipes for solutions, and parame- ters for acceptable ways of resolving the issue" (p. 546). Moreover, Dutton and Dukerich concluded that the relationship between a member's sense of the organiza- tion's identity and image and their own sense of self "suggests a very personal connection between organi- zational action and individual motivation" (p. 550). Thus, identity and image, as embodied in labels, help connect one phenomenologically to the organization. Extensions to the Labeling Framework The literature on organizational identity, image, and reputation also suggests two extensions to the labeling framework. First, although labeling has been character- ized as a means of resolving ambiguity, a label that is itself ambiguous may actually achieve a major purpose of labeling-consensus (cf. Eisenberg 1984). As noted, an organizational label contributes to a more or less shared code. The qualifier "more or less" denotes that labels often convey equifinal meaning (Donnellon et al. 1986). "Good corporate citizen" means somewhat dif- ferent things to union members, environmentalists, and consumer groups. This equivocality is functional to the extent that it permits social actors with divergent per- spectives to perceive sufficient' convergence for joint action while preserving sufficient divergence for loose coupling and the capacity for adaptability. This is why Bougon (1992:372) argues that "it is preferable to describe organizations as created by shared labels rather than by shared meanings...." The notion of stakeholders with divergent perspec- tives, coupled with the notion of labeling as a means of social control, suggests a second extension. Sense-mak- ing can be viewed at times as a labeling contest. A complex organization may project dozens of images, ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997 53</page><page sequence="12">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in OQganizations and stakeholders may vie to have their perceived or preferred images reified as a widely accepted label. Labeling contests occur when two or more stakehold- ers attempt to define divergent realities for a given audience. For example, Schmitt (1991) discusses how players, coaches, owners, the media, and fans involved in the 1987 National Football League strike contested the legitimacy of professional teams and games stocked entirely with strikebreakers. Chicago area stakeholders opposing the games labeled the Chicago team the Scab Bears, those who were ambivalent labeled the team the Spare Bears, while those favoring the games lobbied for the label of Replacement Bears. Given the potency of labels, such contests involve far more than mere semantics. Conversely, competing views may not provoke a la- beling contest if the divergent realities are targeted toward divergent audiences or toward the same audi- ence but at different times. Katz (1988) notes that while some senior managers at Sears repeatedly in- formed the corporation's buyers that Sears was defined by the strength of its buyers, other managers repeat- edly extolled the view for the network of stores that Sears was defined by the strength of its sales force. Each audience was assured that it embodied "the" essence of Sears. Indeed, effective managers are adept at decoupling dualities, paradoxes, and contradictions into internally consistent pieces and channeling each piece to the "appropriate" audience so that the dis- crepancies remain latent and unexpressed (Ashforth 1991). It is important to distinguish what we mean by a labeling contest from the more generic process of so- cial construction among peers described earlier and illustrated in Figure 1. In social construction, peers compare their emergent perceptions and triangulate on a common perception. This statement contains two latent assumptions: (1) the peers are not strongly com- mitted to their initial views, and thus are willing to gravitate toward a modal, socially-validated view, and (2) the peers have relatively equal power, such that one cannot simply impose his or her viewpoint, or the peers are unable or unwilling to exercise their power, per- haps to preserve goodwill and cohesion. In organiza- tional settings, however, often neither assumption holds. Structural differentiation creates, almost by defi- nition, both differential patterns of task-related foci and possibly values, and thus commitments, and an uneven distribution of power, and possibly the motiva- tion to use power (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967). Thus, rather than socially construct a given social object, perceivers may attempt to enforce their preferred label by exercising power through such means as coercion, bargaining, and coalition formation. We argue, then, that labeling processes are likely to result in a labeling contest if social actors are strongly committed to diver- gent perceptions of the social object in question, and if they are able and willing to use power to impose their perceptions. In sum, the labeling framework suggests that terms such as organizational identity, image, and reputation can be viewed as a compact means of signifying the organization. Labels provide a cogent tag, shorn of the confusing and diffuse irregularities and paradoxes that would otherwise plague sense-making. By projecting desirable labels, an organization stakes a claim to a status that might be difficult to establish by other means. Organizational labels may serve as a sensitizing device for imparting a vision, may cue a frame for interpreting and guiding action, and may provide an identity tag for defining organizational members. Our discussion of extensions to the labeling framework sug- gests two final propositions: PROPOSITION 6. Paradoxically, consensus on the (general) meaning of a social object may be achieved by utilizing ambiguous labels. PROPOSITION 7. If perceivers are committed to diver- gent views of a given social object, and are able and willing to utilize power to impose their views, then labels will be the outcome of a labeling contest rather than social construction per se. Discussion and Conclusion Organizational scientists have shown increasing inter- est in the issue of how individuals come to interpret, organize, and convey their experiences in organiza- tions. An emerging theme is that organizations can be seen as interpretive structures, where meaning is socially constructed and symbolically mediated. We contrasted the literatures on categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory to create a labeling framework, and then applied this framework to specific issues at the individual, group, and organizational lev- els of analysis. We argued that categories and labels are used to structure and simplify the social environment, particu- larly where individuals are subject to task constraints. Labels- distill a complex and often contradictory array of amorphous impressions into a concise and coherent package, thus providing a parsimonious means of com- prehending and communicating about social objects. Although categorization theory and labeling theory typ- 54 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997</page><page sequence="13">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations ically focus on personal criteria such as gender and behavior as the basis for grouping individuals, in orga- nizations the structural bases of differentiation often provide overriding situational criteria. Because perceptions of a social object are inherently uncertain, individuals often seek to compare and vali- date their perceptions against those of trustworthy social referents-typically primary group peers. Thus, labels can be described as socially constructed. Social construction may also be cued and guided by the symbolic actions of management and other powerhold- ers. However, if two or more perceivers are committed to discrepant labels and are able and willing to use power to impose their views, then the process can be described as more like a labeling contest. Alternatively, an ambiguous label may accommodate discrepant per- ceptions and allow perceivers to act as if they had achieved consensus. Four themes that crosscut the literature on catego- rization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory were critical to our applications of the labeling framework to organizational settings. First, given the inherent ambi- guity of social stimuli, categories and labels are inher- ently arbitrary. Labeling is about the imposition rather than the discovery of meaning. Second, because the attendant schemas are based on prototypes or exem- plars, labeling tends to deindividuate members of the category. Thus, if a more individuated response is required, the greater efficiency afforded by labeling will have been bought at the price of reduced effective- ness. Third, labels carry evaluative connotations which attach to the members. Given the relational and com- parative nature of categories, labeling imposes not only a social identity, but a social status. Finally, categories and labels may become reified as objective and norma- tive representations of social reality, creating self- fulfilling prophecies and inducing targets to internalize the labels as valid reflections of self. One implication is that individuals who first encounter a social object typically have a disproportionately large impact on the labeling and subsequent actions of the object. An implicit theme of the paper is that labeling is not a neutral process: perceivers are motivated to label a social object so as to not only foster understanding and consensus, but to enhance their self-image relative to the object and to control the object. Thus, a given label may say as much about the perceiver as the target (Ashforth and Humphrey 1995). Further, the motivated and arbitrary nature of labeling underscores the impor- tance of power in the process. Although the role of power is most obvious in labeling contests, the capacity to construct and communicate meaning in an organiza- tional setting is ultimately about power-whether it is vested in expertise, authority, popularity, centrality, or the like. Research Implications As an introduction to labeling processes in organiza- tional settings, our overview raises many issues for research. As a start, a research agenda might pursue two major foci: process issues and content issues. Re- garding process, research should examine the dynamics of labeling when perceivers confront a novel or particu- larly ambiguous social object. Perception is a function of many factors, from the organizational (e.g., culture, mission) to the individual (e.g., personality, motivation), and from the interpersonal (e.g., similarity, account- ability) to the task-specific (e.g., occupation, task con- straints). What determines the salience of such factors and how do they interact to affect the perception of social objects? We discussed four motives for labeling: understanding, consensus, control, and image enhance- ment. There may well be latent contradictions and dilemmas between these motives. How necessary is it to resolve them, and how do they get resolved? We discussed the importance of social referents and pow- erholders in labeling. How, precisely, do referents help one to resolve ambiguity, and what factors affect one's receptivity to a powerholder's influence? We have im- plicitly treated the social object as a relatively passive spectator in the labeling process. Given the conse- quences of labeling, however, it is likely that individu- als, groups, and organizations will engage in impression management. What determines their choice of impres- sion management tactics and the success of those tac- tics? Regarding content, research should examine the substance of particular labels. What factors effect the selection and combination of personal and situational criteria? Are there typologies of labels for various social objects? To what extent does the process of labeling determine the content of the label? We have tended to assume that a given label evokes the same schema among individuals. Yet semiotics cautions us that a signifier may connote different things to differ- ent people and in different contexts and times (e.g., Tierney 1987). To what extent are the schemas for common labels shared, and what influences this sharedness? Further, as Barley (1983:410) argues, a coherent perception of a social object is communicated through "semiotic parallels," where various signifiers reinforce the same meaning. What other kinds of signi- fiers reinforce labels? What factors affect the per- ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 8, No. 1, January-February 1997 55</page><page sequence="14">BLAKE E. ASHFORTH AND RONALD H. HUMPHREY Labeling in Organizations ceived degree of "parallelism" between these signi- fiers? Crosscutting the process and content questions is the level-of-analysis issue. We argued that the labeling framework applies to social objects at the individual, group, and organizational levels. An important empiri- cal issue is how similar the process and content of labeling are across these levels. We speculate that the process of constructing social objects at each level of analysis is much the same and, perhaps more surpris- ingly, that the content is somewhat similar as well. The similarity in process stems from the seminal argument that an individual's perceptions of ambiguous stimuli are grounded in the representations of social referents and powerholders. Given the inherent ambiguity of social objects, this argument and the processes that flow from it should apply equally to all levels of analy- sis. The similarity in content, we speculate, is based on the human tendency to anthropomorphize abstract (and inanimate) objects. By endowing objects with human characteristics, we render them more familiar and, perhaps wishfully, more understandable and control- lable. Moreover, anthropomorphic labels often cluster into archetypes-that is, basic and universal images (Mitroff 1983)-such as the paternalistic (good father) employer, the heroic upstart, and the villainous preda- tor. The extent to which such parallels exist across organizational levels is an intriguing question for fu- ture research. Finally, this research agenda is amenable to a variety of research settings, including: job interviews and ser-. vice encounters, where organizational members must quickly and accurately categorize strangers; occasions requiring negotiation and conflict resolution, where opposing parties must strategically manage labeling; sites undergoing organizational change and develop- ment, where change agents must articulate the purpose and foci of change; and shareholders' meetings, press conferences, and courtrooms, where organizational im- ages are publicly presented and often contested. A variety of settings would allow key process and content variables to surface, and would provide evidence of their generalizability.
