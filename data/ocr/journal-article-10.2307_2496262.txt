<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES D. BARTON JOHNSON Vladimir Nabokov's Solus Rex and the "Ultima Thule" Theme Nabokov's unfinished novel, Solus Rex, composed in Paris during the winter of 1939-40, was the final flowering of the author's "last season of Russian prose writing." 1 The novel was ultimately abandoned following Nabokov's emigration to America in May 1940. Nabokov apparently intended to resume work on it, for in a letter of April 29, 1941, to his new friend Edmund Wilson, he remarked that he had "left Europe in the middle of a vast Russian novel which will soon start to ooze from some part of my body if I go on keeping it inside."2 There was no resumption, however. The two completed chapters, each thirty-odd pages in length, were published separately under the titles "Solus Rex" and "Ultima Thule." The former appeared in the final issue of the Parisian emigre journal Sovremennve zapiski and the latter in the first issue of Mark Aldanov's New York emigre journal, Nov vi zhurnal.3 The two chapters show virtually no interrelation, and it had been assumed that the publication dates reflected the intended order of progression in the completed work. Only with the appearance of the English translation in 1973 did Nabokov affirm that "Ultima Thule" is chapter one and "Solus Rex" chapter two. Nabokov had earlier informed his German bibliographer, Dieter E. Zimmer, that Solus Rex, used as the title of the separately published second chapter, was intended as the title of the entire novel. Solus Rex, presumably because of its fragmentary nature, has attracted very little critical attention. Such study as it has received has focused on the relationship of the "Solus Rex" chapter, which tells of political intrigue in a remote, mythical, northern island kingdom, to the 1962 English novel Pale Fire. In this article I will examine Solus Rex first in its own terms and then in relation to Bend Sinister, the first English novel undertaken after the abandonment of Solus Rex. Bend Sinister grows thematically (albeit not in plot or setting) from the earlier work and sheds a good deal of light on the central mystery of Solus Rex, most specifically on the "Ultima Thule" chapter. Solus Rex can be viewed as a crystalization of a central Nabokovian theme that first emerges in Invitation to a Beheading (1938) and The 1.

The "Ultima Thule" theme is that of death and the hereafter. "Ultima Thule," the opening chapter of Solus Rex, takes the form of an imaginary letter from the narrator, Sineusov, an emigre Russian artist staying on the Riviera, to his late wife. Although his wife has been, dead for nearly a year, all of the artist's thoughts and activities continue to revolve around her. Sineusov's single obsession is to learn whether or not he can hope to establish contact with his wife either now or in the hereafter. Such hopes are darkened by the artist's mocking distrust of spiritualists and his deep suspicion of religion. In the letter Sineusov recalls many details of their life together, including the last harrowing months in which the pregnant wife is dying of tuberculosis of the throat. Among his memories is a scene in which his bedridden wife, no longer able to speak, writes on her small slate that the things she loved most in life were "verse, wildflowers and foreign currency."4 This last is occasioned by a commission that Sineusov receives to do a series of illustrations for an epic poem entitled "Ultima Thule." The poem is written in a strange Nordic tongue, and the poet has such a negligible command of French, their sole common language, that the artist has only the haziest impression of the work he is to illustrate. Insofar as Sineusov can ascertain, the epic tells of an unhappy, unsociable king who rules a melancholy and strife-torn island kingdom set in the mists of the far north. After making some preliminary sketches which seem to please the poet, the artist starts work, but the poet suddenly disappears, leaving the project suspended in a void. Sineusov, grief-stricken by his wife's illness and death, continues his illustrations simply to distract himself. Sineusov's letter has a more immediate point of departure than memories of his marriage. It is triggered by his recent encounter with Adam Il'ich Falter, his boyhood mathematics tutor in Russia. The artist reminisces to his wife about their brief visit with Falter, the gifted son of an alcoholic restaurant cook in St. Peters- burg,5 who after emigration had become the manager of a Riviera resort hotel. This visit took place shortly before the onset of the wife's prolonged illness, and Sineusov had forgotten about Falter until one day he was hailed on the beach by Falter's brother-in-law, who told the bereaved artist a strange story. Falter had been traveling and stopped for the night at a small village hotel. A short while after he retired, the night air was rent by sounds resembling "the paroxysmal, almost exultant screams of a woman in the throes of infinitely painful childbirth-a woman, however, with a man's voice and a giant in her womb."6 The screaming paralyzed all who heard it, and some time elapsed before the manager gained access to the room where the silent Falter stood vacuously. Not responding to questions, he walked out of the room, urinated copiously from the top of the stairs, returned to his bed, and fell into a deep sleep. Falter's sister and brother-in-law bring home the madman whose behavior continues to be bizarre but harmless. Falter's case attracts the attention of a 4.

The Russian phrase is a punning surface translation of "pauvres vaches, il'v en a beaucoup " ("poor cows, there are many of them") (see Nabokov- Wilson Letters, pp. 47-48). There is also a latent reference in "na boku" ("on his side") to author Nabo- kov. 6.

The doctor, Bonomini, is the originator of a form of therapy involving historical, costumed psychodramas that lead to a cure by reenacting the ancestral etiology of the patients' psychoses. This promising method is of little avail in Falter's case, and consequently the psychiatrist takes a more direct approach and asks Falter about the cause of his nocturnal screams. After some prodding, Falter confides in the good doctor, who thereupon suffers massive heart failure. At the inquest, Falter, no less mad than before, tells the authorities that he has solved "the riddle of the universe" and that the shock of the imparted secret has been too much for the psychiatrist.7 At the time of his chance encounter with Falter's brother-in-law, Sineusov is on the point of returning to Paris to lose himself in his aborted "Ultima Thule" commission for, as he says, "that island born in the desolate, gray sea of my heartache for you, now attracted me as the home of my least expressible thoughts."8 On hearing of Falter's experience, however, the narrator realizes his former tutor's revelation may answer his question about possible reunification with his dead wife. To this end he arranges a meeting with Falter, who refuses to impart his lethal secret to his former pupil, although the latter promises either a vow of silence or, if Falter prefers, immediate suicide.9 A long Socratic dialogue ensues in which Sineusov is permitted to probe the periphery of the ultimate revelation by asking Falter about the existence of God and, more central to his immediate concern, about the preservation of personal identity beyond the grave. Falter replies to these questions with a mixture of seeming inanities and tantalizing paradoxes. At length Sineusov breaks off the interview, no wiser than before. To his surprise, a few days later he receives from Falter's brother-in-law a bill for his "consultation." Not only has the artist not found answers to his questions, but he is still skeptical that his mad former tutor actually possesses, as he claims, "a key to absolutely all the doors and treasure chests in the world." 10 A short time later Sineusov receives a note from the now hospitalized madman informing him that he, Falter, will die on Tuesday and "that 7. The riddle of the universe is a frequent motif in Nabokov's novels. In the 1928 work King, Queen, Knave, Franz has a dream in which Dreyer stands atop a ladder and winds a red phonograph which Franz knows will suddenly "bark the word that solved the universe." During his nightmares he suffers "a certain nonterrestrial sensation, known to those who ... have suddenly gone insane after deciphering the meaning of everything" (Vladimir Nabokov, King, Queen, Knave [New York, 1968], p. 202; idem, Korol', clanma, valet [New York, 1968], p. 196). Pnin, while reflecting upon an afterlife, suddenly seems to be on the verge of"a simple solution of the universe" (Vladimir Nabokov, Pnin [New York, 1957], p. 58). Similar references in other Nabokov works are cited below. 8. Russian Beauty, p. 147. The artist has entered into Ultima Thule, the island kingdom of the poem he is illustrating. The only textual clue to his transformation into the character Kr occurs when the thoughts of the king momentarily seem to blend with those of "the no longer independent artist Dmitri Nikolaevich Sineusov" as he gazes at a ruby-lettered neon sign RENAULT (ibid., p. 190). In the Russian text, the word GARAGE is in Latin script (SZ, p. 9). This obscure fleeting reference is the only firm link between the two chapters. More tenuous is an association between a friend of Sineusov's referred to as "poor Adolf," who may or may not have been transformed into the overthrown and murdered Prince Adulf (see Russian Beauty, p. 152; Vesna v Fialte, p. 281 and Russian BeautY, p. 191; SZ, p. 11). In his preface to the English translation, Nabokov admits that he modeled the physical aspect of Adulf on S. P. Diaghilev, the impresario of the Ballet Russe. Adulf, Nabokov says, is one of his "favorite characters in the private museum of stuffed people that every grateful writer has somewhere on the premises" (Russian BeautY, p. 148). One last faint interecho is that the author of the epic poem describes its setting to Sineusov as "a melancholy and remote island" (ibid., p. 164). In the "Solus Rex" chapter the island kingdom is described as that "ile triste et lointaine" (ibid., p. 192). The Russian texts use the identical wording "grustnyi i dalekii" in both occurrences (Vesna v Fialte, p. 291 and SZ, p. 12). 9. Russian Beauty, p. 168; Vesna v Fialte, p. 296. 10.

II All of the foregoing has been recounted in Sineusov's letter which is composed on the following day and which ends on the gloomy thought that perhaps his memories are the only guarantee of his wife's continued existence. What Sineusov has failed to notice during his discussion with Falter is that in the course of illustrating a point about the nature of "an all-encompassing truth," the madman has made passing reference to "the poetry of a wildflower or the power of money," phrases more than vaguely reminiscent of the words of Sineusov's dying wife. 12 Later in the conversation, Falter, in response to Sineusov's query as to why he appears less than omniscient (supposing the truth of his claim), replies, "I act like a beggar, [a versifier] who has received a million [in foreign currency] but goes on living in his basement, for he knows that the least concession to luxury would ruin his liver." 13 The bracketed words, absent in the Russian original, have been inserted into the English text by Nabokov in order to afford further sustenance to Falter's claim, but the bereaved artist again fails to recognize the evidence he so eagerly seeks. "Solus Rex," the second chapter of Nabokov's novel, opens with the morning awakening of the king of a remote northern island country. The ruler is referred to as Kr in the Russian version and K in the English, both alluding to the standard chess abbreviations for king. Through Kr's thoughts we learn the troubled history of his kingdom and the story of his accession to the throne five years previously through a coup against his libertine, homophilic cousin Adulf. Kr, however, is a morose scholar manque and has little taste for either pomp or power. Apart from a mysterious allusion to the "no longer independent artist Dmitri Nikolaevich Sineu- sov," there is seemingly no connection between the characters and events of the "Ultima Thule" chapter and those of "Solus Rex." I4 Nabokov's introductory note to the English translation clarifies this anomaly. Sineusov has indeed returned from the Riviera to his Paris apartment, where he has immersed himself in his artistic re- creation of Ultimia Thule, the island born of heartache which has now become the home of his least expressible thoughts.'5 In his new imaginary kingdom, Sineusov, transformed into Kr, is to be reunited with his late wife, now reincarnated as his Queen Belinda. Nabokov's note tells us that the reunion will be a brief one, however, for Sineusov/ Kr's wife is to die again that very day, a chance victim of an unsuccess- ful assassination attempt on her husband. As we know, Nabokov, counter to his intention, did not return to his "vast" Russian novel-in-progress. Whether there were structural difficulties in coalescing the disparate completed sections or whether the favorable critical reviews of Nabo- kov's first English-language novel, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, encouraged Nabokov to abandon Russian for English is not clear.'6 Nor is there evidence to suggest that the author contemplated translating the completed portions and continuing in English. Solus Rex was abandoned -at least in the form its author had originally conceived it. 11. Russian Beauty, p. 181; Vesna v Fialte, p.'313. 12. Russian Beauty, p. 172; Vesna v Fialte, p. 301. 13.

The most evident line of descent is from the "Solus Rex" section of the uncompleted work to Pale Fire, written nearly twenty years after its progenitor. Andrew Field in his pioneering study Nabokov: His Life in Art has performed an admirable service in tracing the complex inter- relations of Solus Rex and Pale Fire. In consequence, I shall restrict myself to noting a few broad parallels of theme and fact. Foremost, of course, are the imaginary northern island kingdoms, Ultima Thule and Nova Zembla, with their respective rulers, Kr and King Charles. The latter parallel is the more evident when it is realized that Kr, the Russian chess notation for korol' (king), etymologically derives from the Latin form of Charlemagne, Karl Magnus.'7 Seminal in both novels is the idea of a work of art, a poem, which, little understood by the heroes, becomes the springboard for the creation of a mythological kingdom ruled by the narrator. Both men, alien to the lands of their residence, are driven to this fantasy ploy by personal tragedy: Sineusov by the death of his beloved wife and Botkin/ Kinbote by madness of unknown origin. The parallel is established most pointedly when Kinbote urges upon Shade the title "Solus Rex" for his poem "Pale Fire." Although "Solus Rex" - a term referring to a type of chess problem in which Black has only a single piece, the king - has no relevance to the actual content of Shade's poem, it is an exceedingly apt title for the stories of both King Charles the Beloved of Nova Zembla and Kr of Ultima Thule. The more immediate but less renowned offshoot of Nabokov's unfinished Russian novel is the 1947 Bend Sinister, which in concept proceeds directly from the "Ultima Thule" chapter of Solus Rex. Nabokov's last mention of Solus Rex to Edmund Wilson was in April 1941. In November 1942, he wrote Wilson referring for the first time to a novel-in-progress called The Person from Porlock. II This was the first of a number of titles considered and rejected by the author before he settled on Bend Sinister. At various intermediate stages prior to the completion of the novel in early 1946, Nabokov referred to it as Game to Gunm, Vortex, and, most importantly for our purpose, Solus Rex.'9 The events of Bend Sinister take place in an imaginary European state that has just experienced a revolution installing as dictator a certain Paduk, the founder of the Ekwilist (Equalist) Party. The protagonist of the narrative is Adam Krug, Paduk's erstwhile schoolmate and now a world-famous philosopher who teaches at the national university. The novel opens with the mysterious hospital death of Krug's adored wife, which leaves him with their eight-year-old son David. The plot centers on the resistance of Krug, the country's only internationally known intellec- tual, to increasingly brutal government pressure to gain his public endorsement. Krug thinks himself invulnerable to such pressure even after he sees the arrest and disappearance of his friends and colleagues one by one. When even these measures fail to obtain the philosopher's acquiescence, he too is arrested, and, more impor- tantly, David is taken hostage. Krug immediately capitulates, but it is too late; through administrative error the boy has been killed. The state makes a final attempt to secure Krug's cooperation by giving him the power to save twenty-four of his friends, but as a result of David's death the government has lost its only hold 17.

In a final confrontation the crazed Krug reverts to his schooldays and rallies a charge against Paduk on their old school playing field. Krug's author-induced madness takes the form of a revelation that is confirmed in the book's closing pages by the explicit intrusion into the narrative of the "anthropomorphic deity," who creates and controls the fictive universe and rescues Krug at the instant of death. The only obvious point of similarity between the "Ultima Thule" section of Solus Rex and Bend Sinister is that their protagonists, the artist Sineusov and the philosopher Krug, have recently lost their wives. Apart from this, the two works would seem to have little in common in terms of plot, setting, or characterization. In fact, they share a common central theme and within that thematic context a number of subthemes and motifs. The theme of Bend Sinister, the more fully developed work, is fairly explicit. Prior to the death of his wife, Professor Krug had never engaged in the traditional philosopher's quest for the "True Substance, the One, the Absolute," for he felt too keenly the absurdity of "a finite mind peering at the irridescence of the invisible through the prison bars of integers."20 Following her death, however, Krug, while putting his young son to bed, is suddenly overwhelmed at the sight of this little creature, "the whole suffused with consciousness, which is the only real thing in the world and the greatest mystery of all." 21 Later that evening Krug begins a philo- sophical essay: "In this preliminary report on infinite consciousness a certain scumbling of the essential outline is unavoidable. We have to discuss sight without being able to see."22 At this point there is a knock on the door, and the police arrive to arrest Krug and his son. His emergent pursuit of the Absolute is cut short. Krug, however, ultimately attains the fundamental insight that he seeks. After his son's death and the night before he and his friends are to be shot, the anguished philosopher is visited in his dark prison cell by a ray of light along which slides an emanation from "the mind behind the mirror," the anthropomorphic deity of the novel, who spares Krug by rendering him mad.23 This "blessed madness" is of a very special sort. The tormented philosopher suddenly understands that he and his entire world are merely fictional creations in the mind of their creator in his own "real" world. Hence nothing matters. The horror, the anguish, the pain are not real. The mad Krug, with his expanded consciousness of both worlds, has now achieved true invulnerability. At the instant of death, Krug is gathered up into the real world of his author, the anthropomorphic deity. Krug's revelation is that the limited conscious- ness of his world which makes it seem self-contained and "real" is merely an enclave, a closed circle, within the (relatively) infinite consciousness of its creator, the author, in his world. Given this revelation, it becomes clear that the many "co- incidences" scattered throughout the narrative are deliberate tokens of the omni- potent and omniscient author who transcends the two worlds.24 Krug has dis- covered the secret of his universe and, with it, the meaning of death and the beyond. To return to "Ultima Thule," Falter, like Krug, comes into possession of the "secret of the universe" and is not strong enough to withstand the revelation. He too 20. Bend Sinister, p. 152. 21.

There can be only one ultimate secret, and it is obvious that Falter's revelation is the same as Krug's: the solution to the mystery of consciousness. The crucial issue is whether consciousness is inherently limited and somehow circum- scribed or whether it is infinite. Within the fictional world in which the characters dwell, it is finite. For denizens of that world, Ultimate Enlightenment, the Ab- solute Truth means breaking through the confines of that circumscribed conscious- ness in which they reside and merging with the (relatively) infinite consciousness of their creator in his own "real" circumambient universe. The point of contact between the two worlds is death. This aesthetic cosmology and the "ultimate" question that leads to its revelation are termed the Ultima Thule theme. This cosmogonic theory is of import not only in itself, but also because it contains the answer to a corollary question of more immediate consequence to Sineusov, who has asked Falter, "Is there even a glimmer of one's identity beyond the grave, or does it all end in ideal darkness?"25 Falter gives an evasively paradoxi- cal reply touching vaguely on the idea of consciousness. For a more explicit answer we must turn again to the cosmology posited in Bend Sinister. The answer would seem to be as follows: if consciousness is infinite, then personal identity may survive beyond the grave; if consciousness is limited, then death is ultimate darkness. Death, at least for authorial favorites, is simply the transition point between limited and infinite consciousness. This is of burning importance to both Sineusov and Krug, who are obsessed with their deceased wives (and sons). It is the motivation for their search for the riddle of the universe-the Ultima Thule theme. The two mad Adams, Falter and Krug, have been bereft of their senses by the same revelation, and both have attained the same ultimate enlightenment. Further parallels, which go well beyond what we have thus far indicated, are downplayed by the differing emphasis of the two works. Although Sineusov and Krug are brought to their fundamental inquiry by the deaths of their wives, the consciousness theme and its two-world corollary are developed differently. Sineusov's probings are motivated almost entirely by his loss and the hope of bridging that terrible chasm. Hence to him the primary issue is the survival of personal identity (hers, his) after death. The question of consciousness is for him more abstract and less immediate. For Krug, the professional philosopher, the loss of his wife, while no less soul- rending, entails a consideration of the more fundamental, more abstract issue of consciousness. All else flows from that. Ultimately, however, both of these matters are adjunct to the issue at the core of the Ultima Thule theme-the meaning of death. Identity of major theme is perhaps not sufficient grounds to assert a direct genetic tie between the "Ultima Thule" chapter of Solus Rex and Bend Sinister. The preceding argument about the nature of Falter's revelation is based on a backcast- ing from Bend Sinister to Solus Rex. It is possible to advance a line of evidence running in the opposite direction-from Solus Rex to Bend Sinister. In the midst of their discourse, when Sineusov expresses doubt about Falter's claim to omniscience, to absolute wisdom, the madman replies that he does not claim to know all, just everything that he might want to know. He then continues: "Anyone could say that-couldn't he?-after having leafed through an encyclopedia; only the encyclo- pedia whose exact title I have learned (there, by the way-I am giving you a more elegant definition: I know the title of things) is literally all-inclusive."26This title 25.

Russian Beauty, p. 172; Vesna v Fialte, pp. 301-302.</page><page sequence="8">550 Slavic Review trope comes up again in a discussion of the relationship of the idea of God to Falter's revelation. When Falter rejects the posited relationship as irrelevant, Sineusov infers that if the secret, the thing sought, is not linked to the concept of God and "if that thing is, according to your terminology, a kind of universal 'title,' then the concept of God does not appear on the title page,"27 and no God exists. Falter continues to disallow the association, and Sineusov makes one last, un- successful attempt to force an answer by posing the question in negative form: "One cannot, then, seek the title of the world in the hieroglyphics of deism?"28 This Borgesian discussion of absolute omniscience in terms of encyclopedia and title has a ghost echo in Bend Sinister.29 I have already remarked that Solus Rex was among the tentative titles for Bend Sinister considered by Nabokov. Another, much more mysterious, was Game to Gunm. This title has no obvious relevance to any incident in Bend Sinister, but it would seem to be beyond coincidence that Game to Gunm is the title of volume ten of the Encyclopedia Britannica. As I have shown elsewhere, two entries in that volume, specifically those on God and geome- try, are particularly germane to the theme and its realization in Bend Sinister. The entire texture of the novel is permeated (sometimes quite literally) with cryptic allusions and patterns manifesting "a mind behind the mirror" that manipulates Krug's terror-ridden world. At the end of the narrative, this anthropomorphic deity, as Nabokov calls him in the preface, openly intervenes and makes himself known to Krug. He is the author of the encyclopedia, and Krug, like Falter, has learned the title of one of the encyclopedia volumes. A second series of allusions found in Bend Sinister is also faintly foreshadowed in "Ultima Thule." One of the archetypes for Krug, whose name means "circle" in Russian, is the Greek geometer Archimedes, to whom the oft-quoted phrase Noli disturbare meos circulos! is attributed. This is but one of numerous associations between Krug and mathematics, particularly geometry. It can be argued that the very model of the two worlds of Bend Sinister, that of Krug and that of his maker, and the connection between them can be symbolized by a geometric figure known as the Archiinedes Spiral. Thus in some metaphorical sense mathematics models the cosmological revelation sought and then obtained by Krug. The seeds of this geometry motif are sown in "Ultima Thule" when Sineusov recalls with pleasure how Falter would intermix his prosaic tutoring "with unusually elegant manifesta- tions of mathematical thought, which left a certain chill of poetry."30 Perhaps more important is Sineusov's mental re-creation of the events immediately preceding Falter's revelation. The artist tries to imagine Falter's random thoughts as the doomed man absently makes his nocturnal way back from a bordello to the fateful hotel room. Among these disparate and inconsequential thoughts is an "amusing mathematical problem about which he had corresponded the year before with a Swedish scholar."3' This is, however, but one of the dissociated thoughts that apparently provide the combinational context for Falter's metamorphosis.32 27.

The butterfly, due to its</page><page sequence="9">Nabokov's Solus Rex and "Ultima Thule" 551 Resonant with the geometry motif in the two novels is the preoccupation with circles and curves. Here again the figure is embryonic in Solus Rex and more elaborately developed in Bend Sinister. In their long dialogue Falter repeatedly warns his former pupil against logical deduction as a means of ferreting out the secret of the universe. Logical reasoning is adequate, Falter says, for "covering short distances, but the curvature of the earth, alas, is reflected even in logic."33 Such logic simply brings one back to the point of departure "with a delightful sensation that you have embraced truth, while actually you have merely embraced yourself."34 Other references to the distorting and self-defeating effect of the curvature of logical thought abound,35 and I have discussed previously the centrality of circle imagery to the worlds of Bend Sinister and Krug's attempts to break through the vicious autocircumscribed circle of his own world to penetrate that of his maker. This preoccupation with curvature links the two novels in yet another im- portant way. The central characters, Sineusov and Krug, both seek gnostic knowl- edge in consequence of the death of their wives. Their kinship goes beyond this, however, and is even reflected in their names. I have mentioned that Krug's name means "circle" and that his name resonates with the basic conceptual configuration of Bend Sinister. Sineusov's name has similarly critical associations that prefigure those of Krug's name. The Russian meaning of Sineusov is "blue moustache," a meaning reflected in Falter's whimsical mode of addressing his former pupil as Moustache-Bleue.36 Just as Krug's name has bilingual associations, so does Sineu- sov's-it evokes the Latin word sinus, meaning "curve." The curve of Sineusov prefigures the fully developed circle of Krug. Both men, at least initially, are trapped in the circular dungeon of thought that debars their access to the secret they wish to learn. Other associations arise from the similarity of the name Sineusov to the Latin sinister, meaning "left, unfavorable, injurious." Sineusov, like Krug (and Falter and Paduk), is left-handed. It is perhaps this last fact that echoes faintly in metamorphic transformations (egg, caterpillar, cocoon-like pupa, and butterfly), is a traditional reli- gious symbol of immortality of the soul and has often been so used by lepidopterist Nabokov. For a particularly clear-cut example, see the 1924 story "Christmas" in Vladimir Nabokov, Details of a Sunset and Other Stories (New York, 1976). The Russian version is "Rozhdestvo" in Vozvrashchenie Chorba: Rasskazv i Stixi (Ann Arbor, 1976). A survey of butterflies as intermediaries from the "other" world may be found in W. W. Rowe, Nabokov's Spectral Dimension. The Other World in his Works (Ann Arbor, 1981), p. 113. It is curiously apt that Falter, who has completed the metamorphic cycle, is both the past and present tutor of his pupil Sineusov. The words "pupil" and "pupa," the cocoon-like state of metamorphosis, are close cognates. 33. Russian Beauty, p. 169; Vesna v Fialte, p. 297. 34. Nabokov via Falter rounds off this discussion of circularity with a word play that is striking in English but stunning in Russian. Compare the English "logical development inexorably becomes an envelopment" (Russian Beauty, p. 169) and the Russian "razvitie rokovyim obrazom stanovitsia svitkom" (development inexorably turns into a scroll) ( Vesna v Fialte, p. 297). The verbal root vit means "twist, turn." 35. Russian BeautY, p. 174; Vesna v Fialte, p. 304 and Russian Beauty, p. 178; Vesna v Fialte, pp. 308-309. 36. Falter's use of "Moustache-Bleue" (Russian Beautv, pp. 175-76) is restricted to the English version. A number of changes have been introduced into the treatment of proper names in the trans- lation. In the original, Falter's brother-in-law and sister and the Italian psychiatrist all remain nameless. In the translation, they become Mr. and Eleonora L., and the doctor becomes Bonomini in another of Nabokov's ritualistic aspersions on psychiatrists. The name Sineusov is drawn from a list of names of extinct Russian noble families supplied to Nabokov by a historian friend in the thirties (see Andrew Field, Nabokov: His Life in Part [New York, 1977], p. 200).</page><page sequence="10">552 Slavic Review Nabokov's final title, Bend Sinister, the heraldic term for bastardy and an apt name for a novel in which all is sinistral. The above argument demonstrates the major lines of association between Solus Rex and Bend Sinister. There remain a number of minor carry-overs that, while not thematic in nature, testify to the close kinship of these temporally sequen- tial, albeit superficially divergent, novels. Overlapping minor motifs include Dr. Bonomini's silly psychodramas and Dr. Amalia Wytwyl's ghastly play therapy, which ends in the death of Krug's son. Another minor motif is Sineusov's dead son-unborn but still a source of anguish to the widower. Krug, like Sineusov, pens a letter to his dead wife,37 and the staghorn bootjack in the royal bedroom of Kr of Ultima Thule38 migrates to Krug's study.39 One further set of questions must be posed about the shared secret of the protagonists of the two novels. Are the revelations of Falter and Krug real or illusory within the context of each book? What reason is there for the protagonists to believe their revelations? This problem particularly plagues Sineusov, who repeatedly tries to force Falter to explain the nature of his proof for his unrevealed revelation. Falter asserts that its truth is self-evident, but nonetheless he inadver- tently (or perhaps advertently) gives evidence of his omniscience with his passing allusion to the words of Sineusov's dying wife-something known only to the artist. Also germane is the fact that Falter, apparently accurately, predicts the day of his own death. The proof of Krug's revelation is at once simpler and more complex. His creator, his author, deliberately and overtly reveals himself, but the revelation maddens the philosopher. This raises the question as to whether his new insight is real or delusional. The truth of his insight is affirmed by Krug's subliminal aware- ness throughout the narrative of the allusive footprints and configurations that bespeak the controlling presence of the novel's other world and its tutelary deity, the author. Thus in both novels the solution to the mystery of the universe, the meaning of death, is found by the protagonists. Solus Rex, Nabokov's last Russian prose work, posits a theme that is central to much of his writing, the theme of the ultimate unknown, death. In Solus Rex, Falter, to whom "the essence of things has been revealed,"40 has solved the riddle of the universe by stumbling upon "'a Truth with a capital T that comprises in itself the explanation and proof of all possible mental affirmations."4' By virtue of this literally mind-shattering revelation, Falter has become superhuman and stands outside our world, in the true reality,42 that is, in another world which proves to be that of an omnipotent author, an anthropomorphic deity. In the unfinished Solus Rex, Truth is not revealed to Sineusov (or the reader), although there is internal evidence that Falter does indeed possess paranormal knowledge. It is, however, only on the basis of Bend Sinister that we can begin to posit an answer to the questions associated with the Ultima Thule theme. Philosopher Krug, in the face of personal tragedy, comes to "the search for the True Substance, the One, the Absolute, the Diamond suspended from the Christmas Tree of the Cos- mos."43 This quest leads him to consider the relative importance of what he calls 37.

He sees death in terms of two possibilities: either the instantaneous gaining of perfect knowledge (defined as the capability of a given point in space and time to identify itself with every other point) or absolute nothingness.45 Krug is deeply dissatisfied with these abstract speculations. It is only when he is suddenly overcome with a welling forth of love for his son that he finds meaningful content for his concept of "perfect knowledge," which is to resolve and harmoniously integrate the "inner" and the "outer" problems. As Krug gazes at David he finds the master key to all of his questions. Consciousness is part of the question, and while it is integral to the answer, it is not itself the solution to the question of death. The solution is that Krug and his world are artistic creations, products of the consciousness of an anthropo- morphic deity who lives in his own world. Krug's world is one of limited conscious- ness existing within what is from his point of view the unlimited consciousness of its creator. Death, the instantaneous gaining of perfect knowledge, simply marks the ascension into the infinite consciousness of one's author. This is precisely what happens in the deus ex machina denouement when the author reveals his presence and then rescues his character at the moment of death. Bend Sinister is a tale of two worlds: one, a fictional world of limited consciousness; the other, a world of infinite consciousness. Death is the point of transition between them. This is the resolution of the quest for Ultima Thule undertaken by Sineusov through Falter and attained by Falter and Krug. Solus Rex is merely a preliminary probing of the theme that finds its mature development in Bend Sinister. The Ultima Thule theme with its attendant cosmology is central to much of Nabokov's mature fiction, but it assumes a dominant position in the late thirties and early forties. Solus Rex is the incomplete center panel of a triptych flanked on the left by The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, written in 1938, and on the right by Bend Sinister, composed between 1942 and 1946. The narrator of Sebastian Knight, who is the Russian half-brother of the recently deceased English writer Sebastian Knight and who knows his half-brother only superficially, receives after several years of silence a letter from Sebastian asking that he visit him in the hospital near Paris where he is dying. That night, the narrator, known only as V., has a dream in which Sebastian seems to promise to solve a "monstrous riddle."46 V., obsessed with this secret throughout his journey, arrives at the dying man's bedside too late. Sub- sequently he decides to undertake a critical biography of Sebastian in an attempt to come to know him and to learn his secret. In his account, which unfolds before our eyes, he recounts Sebastian's last novel, The Doubtful Asphodel, which deals with a dying man's confrontation with his own death. The hero goes through various mental stages. As the end draws near, "We feel," says the narrator, "that we are on the brink of some absolute truth, dazzling in its splendour and at the same time almost homely in its simplicity."47 The secret, the absolute solution, "which would have set free imprisoned thought and granted it the great understanding,"48 is not revealed, however. The hero of The Doubtful Asphodel dies before revealing it. Sebastian Knight introduces the Ultima Thule theme: a death induces a character to 44. Ibid., pp. 153-55. 45. Ibid., pp. 155-56. 46.

The statement of the theme remains rudimentary, however; no solution to the riddle is suggested, nor is the related subtheme of consciousness introduced, as it is marginally in Solus Rex and centrally in Bend Sinister. Sebastian Knight is not the first of Nabokov's novels to treat the Ultima Thule theme. Its earliest major appearance is found in Invitation to a Beheading, which was written in 1934 and which has obvious affinities in tone and theme with Bend Sinister. Cincinnatus, the protagonist, is under sentence of death for the crime of "opacity" in a distopic authoritarian society where all people are transparent. His true crime would seem to be that he is fundamentally an artist whose perceptions differ from those of his philistine fellow citizens. Unlike his complacent neighbors, Cincinnatus has secret inklings of another "ideal" world peopled by beings like himself.49 In his prison journal he records his intimations of this other world, which he intuits from dreams and the existence of various circumambient patterns and allusions representing "leaks" from the ideal world. Cincinnatus is vaguely aware that his world, which seems all too real, is a makeshift stage setting with costumed actors as its inhabitants. Although he senses the falsity of this world in which he awaits death, he is unable to formulate and articulate his vision either to himself or to others. Nonetheless, he insistently affirms that he alone possesses a secret, a sense of the "invisible umbilical cord that joins this world to something-to what I shall not say yet."50 Cincinnatus fears death yet suspects that it will mark the transition point between the terrible world in which he lives and the ideal world. His intuitions are seemingly confirmed when his mock-up world literally begins to disintegrate, and he arises from the headsman's block and moves "in the direction of beings akin to himself."5' The parallel to Bend Sinister is apparent. The hero, facing death, probes "the riddle of the universe" and has his intuition confirmed at the instant of death, which proves to be a transition from a world of circumscribed consciousness to one of infinite consciousness. The treatment of the Ultima Thule theme differs here from its later formulation in that the element of the controlling role of an anthropomorphic deity, an author, in an ideal world is not explicitly formulated, although the idea is certainly latent in the scheme. Otherwise, who is it that shatters the mock world of Cincinnatus as he mounts the scaffold? I have commented on Pale Fire as one of two direct descendants of Solus Rex.52 That kinship, however, is more with the "Solus Rex" chapter of the un- finished novel than with the chapter that sets forth the Ultima Thule theme. An overall parallel still exists, nonetheless, for Kinbote/Botkin uses John Shade's poem as the basis for his own fantastic creation, the world of Nova Zembla, just as Sineusov creates his own kingdom of Ultima Thule on the basis of a poem written in an incomprehensible language. In Pale Fire, however, it is Shade, the poet, and not KinbOte, the mad exegete, who is preoccupied with the Ultima Thule theme. In his poem, Shade examines his feelings arising from the suicide of his daughter and his own impending death. Like Cincinnatus and his other Nabokovian predecessors, he 49.

Yes! It sufficed that I in life could find Some kind of link and bobolink, some kind Of correlated pattern in the game, Plexed artistry, or something of the same Pleasure in it as they who played it found.53 Thus Shade too has probed the ultimate mystery and finds solace in art and in the detection and mimicking of the pattern weaving of the creator of his world, the master artist who lives in his own world on the far side of death, in a universe of infinite consciousness and perfect knowledge. This is, however, a secondary theme in Pale Fire, for the center of the novel is Kinbote's story, not Shade's. Nabokov's last three novels also contain echoes of the Ultima Thule theme. In Ada, the events of the narrative take place in the world of Demonia or Anti-Terra. The hero, Van, devotes his professional life to probing the existence of a mysterious counter-world-an Ultima Thule known as Terra-the existence of which is in- ferred by the collation of dream data and the visions of mystics and madmen. In addition, certain patterns in the texture of Demonia hint at the existence of a controlling hand outside the limits of that world. Anti-Terra's Baron Klim Davidov, the "word-father" of Ada, Van, and Lucette, is the anagrammatic ambassador of Terra's Vladimir Nabokov.54 The underlying pattern of the novella Transparent Things is similar. The events of the tale are narrated by the already deceased novelist, Mr. R, who manipulates the wretched life of the protagonist, Hugh Person, his erstwhile editor, from a world beyond the grave.55 The Ultima Thule theme may also be seen in Nabokov's last novel, Look at the Harlequins! The narrator and hero, Vadim Vadimovich, vaguely senses that he himself is but a "parody, an inferior variant of another man, that other writer, somewhere on this or another earth."56 All of Vadim Vadimovich's novels, both in Russian and in English, have plots and titles that echo in distorted form those of Vladimir Vladi- mirovich Nabokov of this, our world. Near the end of the book, as Vadim lies paralyzed at the threshold of death, he realizes that he has been merely "a figment of somebody's-not even . . . [his] own-imagination."57 The Ultima Thule theme has a number of component parts. The central aspect of the theme is that there are two or more worlds. Only one of these universes is, however, objectively "real." Resident on this real world is an artist who conceives, creates, and regulates a secondary fictional universe and all that happens in it. To most of the inhabitants of the secondary universe, the world is hermetic. A chosen few, however, authorial favorites, sense certain patterns woven into the texture of their world that hint at the existence of an external controlling presence. When these characters are confronted with death, either that of a loved one or their own, they 53. Ibid., p. 62. 54. Evidence for this view is presented in D.

It would seem to coincide closely with our definition of the "Ultima Thule" theme. 56. Vladimir Nabokov, Look at the Harlequins! (New York, 1974), p. 89. 57.

At the instant of their death, their makeshift universes disintegrate, and these favorites are rescued by their creator into his world, the real world. The subtheme of consciousness has an important part in this conceptual cosmology that lies at the heart of so many of Nabokov's novels. The consciousness of the inhabitants of the secondary universe is limited. For them their world is the only world and often a terrible one. In this philistine universe only the chosen few, thanks to their aesthetic sensibilities, suspect the presence of a circumambient universe that, from the point of view of the secondary restricted universe, represents "perfect knowledge" and infinite consciousness. The relation- ship between the created universe, the object of art, and the creating universe, the world of the artist, is characterized by limited versus unlimited consciousness. Death, the transition point between the two worlds, marks the transition of the protagonist from circumscribed awareness to omniscience. Inherent in the entire scheme is the god-like role of the artist, the writer who proposes and disposes in his created world. The Ultima Thule theme occupied a dominant position in Nabokov's writing for forty years. From the 1934 Invitation to a Beheading to the 1974 Look at the Harlequinsl, it provided a conceptual framework for many, but not all, of his works. It is not present in the early Russian novels, the 1936 Despair, or his best Russian novel, The Gift. It is also absent from Lolita. It is, however, to be found in all of the other novels, although different aspects of the theme are addressed in different books. In Invitation to a Beheading, there is no explicit indication of the controlling presence of the other world's anthropomorphic deity, but his presence is obvious in the denouement. In Ada, Transparent Things, and Look at the Har- lequins.l, the image of the artist-creator remains latent, and only by careful detection can the reader arrive at his tacit presence and role. Solus Rex and Pale Fire differ in that their Ultima Thules are the creations of characters within the novels. They entail worlds within worlds within worlds, but their intrinsic schemes do not differ in principle from the simpler models. The "Ultima Thule" chapter of Solus Rex and its immediate successor, Bend Sinister, have served as a springboard for definition and elaboration of this central theme in Nabokov's work because they represent its "classic" statement with all of the above-mentioned ingredients. They explicitly pose the key question from which all else flows-the riddle of the universe. Death is at the center of much of Nabokov's writing-a statement nonetheless true for his having written two comic masterpieces, Lolita and Pale Fire. Death is invariably what precipitates the protagonist's search for a pattern affirming the existence of Ultima Thule. This is more than a purely aesthetic concern as attested by the opening pages of Nabokov's autobiography, Speak, Memorv, where he writes of his quest to "distinguish the faintest of personal glimmers in the impersonal darkness on both sides of my life"- a quest that has included both trenchantly skeptical visits to spiritualists and the ransacking of dreams.58 These probings have led Nabokov, like his doomed poet, John Shade, to take solace and find ecstasy in the intricately patterned game of art. In Nabokov's personal mythology of Ultima Thule, the artist weaves the pattern of his own immortality. 58. Vladimir Nabokov, Speak, Menmory (New York, 1966), p. 20.</page></plain_text>
