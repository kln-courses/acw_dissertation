<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS THE BODY ESSENTIAL FOR ECOFEMINISM? TERRI FIELD The University of Queensland, Australia In this article, the author argues that the body is essential, that is, indispensable, to ecofemi nism. Ecofeminists have revealed the many ways in which women and nature have been devalued and dominated. Although the authorfollows other ecofeminists in disagreeing with a mischaracterisation of ecofeminism as reinforcing an essentialist connection between women and nature, this article's focus is to venture into a subject that has often been dis missed as inherently essentialist: the body. In fact, it is suggested that it is in the interests of environmental philosophers to begin theorising embodimentfrom a specifically ecofeminist perspective. A number of useful ways in which ecofeminists have attempted to deal with issues of embodiment are outlined, highlighting the deficiencies in these approaches. By introducing the work of feminist theorists that problematises a number of long-standing and entrenched assumptions regarding embodiment, this article shows how ecofeminists might benefit from these insights and addresses the inadequacies revealed in this work through an ecofeminist analysis. The kind of characterisation that usually reduces the complexities in ecofeminist positions on women-nature connections to one kind of con nection based on a notion of essence is, as other ecofeminists have shown, a mis characterisation of ecofeminism.1 However, my own disagreement with this mis characterisation is tempered by a concern that interest in ecofeminism's alleged essentialism has been driven by a degree of "essentialism-phobia" that is a legacy of a particular period of feminist debates concerning essentialism, occurring mainly in the 1980s in predominantly Anglo-American feminist circles. Although I will not be dealing with the variety of ways in which I believe essentialism-phobia has manifested within ecofeminist scholarship itself, I am concerned, in this article, with theorising embodiment from a specifically ecofeminist perspective. "The body" has been called "the contested site" for feminism (Chanter, 1995), "essentialism's great text" (Rooney, as cited in Spivak &amp; Rooney, 1994), and "the very 'stuff' of subjectivity" (Grosz, 1994). Why should "thinking through the body" be associated with essentialism, and why should "the body" pose such a risky topic for feminists?2 Feminists long ago identified the association of "woman" and "the body" as contributing to women's exclusion from the cultural sphere (insofar as culture is associated with mind-, rather than body-, related activities). Thus, it is not difficult to see why feminists might want to reject women's association with the body, or the bodily realm. Although contemporary feminist discourse has moved beyond a simple dichotomous choice of either embracing or rejecting this associa tion between women and the body, there has been a continuing suspicion in some feminist circles of any inquiries into what is referred to as bodily specificity, that is, the notion that different bodies are relevant to our experiences in a way that socialisa Organization &amp; Environment, Vol. 13 No. 1, March 2000 39-60 © 2000 Sage Publications, Inc. 39</page><page sequence="2">40 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 tion theories cannot, in themselves, adequately explain. It seems to me that eco feminists are in an ideal position to accept the challenge of demonstrating how our, that is, women's, embodiment (normally associated with "nature") and theorising (considered to be a "cultural" activity) might be integrated in new and insightful ways. Although ecofeminists have extensively theorised women's connections with nature, there has been less attention paid to the various ways in which we might theorise our embodiment. Let me qualify this claim at the outset by acknowledging that issues of embodiment have always been important for ecofeminism. For exam ple, ecofeminists have long recognised the problem of the mind/body distinction and how it maps onto other harmful hierarchical dualistic pairs. Reclaiming women's bodies in particular has been a major focus for radical/cultural feminists, and this has carried through in the work of those who might now be categorised as spiritual ecofeminists. However, with the exception of Carol Bigwood's (1991, 1993) work, I contend that ecofeminists have only just begun to explore the full potential of theorising embodiment from a specifically ecofeminist perspective. I suggest that the development of ecofeminist theories on embodiment will be greatly improved by entering into a more complex dialogue with a number of femi nist philosophers who are concerned with thinking through the body. Just as Gayatri Spivak (1994) has warned us about the usefulness, and thus dan ger, of essentialism,3 so should the body be viewed in this way. While I will be rely ing to some extent on that useful term—the body—I also follow another piece of advice from Spivak, that is, to think of "other words"4 for the body. As a conse quence, I will sometimes use the term "embodiment," whereas at other times I will refer to specific bodies such as "women's bodies." My reason for retaining the use of the body at times is that it provides a focus on the "thing" that needs to be recov ered from its place of exclusion and marginalisation in order to begin theorising the seemingly broader term of embodiment. Focusing on the body seems to bring a degree of what Bigwood (1993) terms "terrestrial weight" into theorising that is often absent when embodiment in general is the focus.5 On the other hand, the broadness of the term "embodiment" is sometimes necessary to avoid essentialis ing the body. Thus, I move between these terms in the following discussion and, given the exploratory sense with which I approach my theorising on embodiment, I have allowed intuition to guide me on the use of these terms. A DECONSTRUCTTVE APPROACH TO THE BODY Insofar as the body shares a devalued position with women and nature, recover ing the body is part of the ecofeminist project. In its singular, abstract, and generic sense, the body needs to be reclaimed from its devalued position in opposition to the mind (and, thus, released from its exclusion from other terms associated with the mind). This is the approach taken by ecofeminists Val Plumwood and Karen War ren in their focus on the logic of dualistic thought. However, on its own, this approach, which makes an attempt to recover the (abstract) body, does not go far enough.6 Rather than focusing only on the recovery of the body along with other devalued terms of dualistic thought, the body itself also can be used to expose the illusionary (yet compelling) divisions between dualistic terms. Elizabeth Grosz (1994) argues that because "the body provides a point of mediation between what is perceived as purely internal and accessible only to the subject and what is external and publicly observable," it thereby provides a point from which to rethink all those binary pairs associated with the mind/body dualism, including inside/outside, pri</page><page sequence="3">Field/ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 41 vate/public, and self/other (pp. 20-21). Grosz speaks of the body as being a "thresh old or borderline concept that hovers perilously and undecidably at the pivotal point of binary pairs" (p. 23). It is in this sense that I understand the body as a potentially deconstructive term. Possibly the best way to make this point is to observe how spe cific bodily experiences undermine the separation and opposition of binary terms. Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak (1991) mentions a number of women's bodily experiences that can be read as "body-parables," suggesting nondual ways of being and knowing. For example, she describes the "soft boundaries" a woman may expe rience on the first day of her menstrual cycle; women's postorgasmic state as being peaceful and expansive (as opposed to a common experience of [negative] vulner ability reported by men); and the way in which pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing blurs the boundaries of me/not me (p. 138). Iris Marion Young and Bigwood have also developed the idea of women's bodily experiences as challenging dual ontolo gies. Young (1990) argues that the experience of pregnancy challenges the notion of a unified subject as well as the usually assumed boundaries of in/out: "I experience my insides as the space of another, yet my own body" (p. 163). Bigwood (1993) also shows how experiences of pregnancy and the mothering body challenge the usually dichotomised terms active/passive, inside/outside, and self/other. She remarks that "[a] woman is inhabited by a growing sentience that is not truly other to herself' (p. 59). Her observations suggest that for a pregnant woman there may be an unavoidable disturbance of any notion of a unified identity that she may have held prior to the pregnancy. However, it is not only women's bodies that defy dualistic categories of being. Although men's bodily experiences may not confront them with their corpo real existence as constantly and emphatically as do women's experiences of men struation, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, it seems strange to me that feminists rarely consider erection and ejaculation as potentially deconstructive bodily experiences for men. For example, erection and ejaculation would certainly seem to confront at least the public/private distinction insofar as a male's "private" sexual feelings or arousal are made "public" (often to the embarrassment of adoles cent boys attempting to hide the evidence of "wet dreams" from their mothers and coping with wayward erections at school swimming carnivals).7 With respect to women's bodily experiences, Luce Irigaray's (1985) work pro vides a good example of how a new metaphysics might be written from a woman's body while deconstructing the old (Western phallocentric) metaphysics in the process. Irigaray contrasts the complicity between rationality and a "mechanics of solids" with a "feminine . . . metaphysics of fluids" (pp. 106-118). Interestingly, Young (1990) makes the observation that Irigaray's approach reveals promising links with the ecofeminist agenda. Young claims that the fluid (feminine) meta physics that Irigaray speaks of "would tend to privilege the living, moving, pulsing over the inert dead matter of the Cartesian world view... the nature of things takes its being from the organic context in which they are embedded" (p. 193). Such a metaphysic would, Young suggests, provide a "better way to think about the world from an ecological point of view" (p. 193). Bigwood (1993), who has recognised this potential, points out that "we are intimately fluid with nature through water" (p. 201). Similar to Irigaray, Bigwood also recognises the disruptive and subversive implications that could be inaugurated by a feminine metaphysic. Making use of Irigaray's strategy of "mimicking movements that draw us back to the earth," she suggests that in our writing and investigations we let "the sway back in our very meth od" so that it "subverts the ungiving dualistic relations of metaphysics" (p. 198).8 Another way to maximise the body's deconstructive potential by attending to bodily specificities can be found in Moira Gatens's (1996) research into the imagi</page><page sequence="4">42 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 nary body. Her notion of the imaginary body refers to "those images, symbols, metaphors and representations which help construct various forms of subjectivity" (p. viii). She demonstrates how an imaginary masculine body represents, and is rep resented by, the modern body politic. First, this imaginary body operates in a meta phorical sense in that the modern body politic has its historical roots in "an image of a masculine body which reflects fantasies about the value and capacities of that body" (p. 25). Second, it is only masculine bodies that are represented politically by this modern body politic. Starting her analysis with Thomas Hobbes's idea of the "artificial man" (the leviathan), which he uses as an analogy for the political body, Gatens exposes the fantasy of man's autonomy from women and the corporeal, which is built into the image of the masculine body politic. She also shows how this representation of the masculine body serves to "swallow" women's bodies, as it were, so that women are left without representation. Women become invisible in such a system, and without ontological status, their contributions also are invisible. Thus, by placing the body in the centre of her analysis, Gatens shows how the body is inscribed in cultural practices, and in the process, she also deconstructs the myth of the universality of this body. An ecofeminist application of Gatens's (1996) imaginary body could be particu larly useful in our explorations of the connections between women and nature, for example, the imaginary maternal body of nature in a number of representations of Mother Earth. In the process of revealing the specificity of "the body" in our repre sentations of Mother Earth, a number of interesting directions are opened for eco feminist thinking, which working on "deconceptualising" the dualistic bind of Mother/Earth (which, arguably, the majority of ecofeminist scholars are concerned with) cannot open. Some of these include (a) how the imaginary maternal body may inform cultural discourse in general, as well as environmental discourse in particu lar; (b) how becoming aware of the imaginary body/ies that may inform our own discourse may be a way to remain self-reflexive in our own theorising; and (c) the importance of not attempting to dissociate nature from its connection with "the mother" before we are able to (or without also being able to) acknowledge our own origins: the maternal body (specifically, a maternal body). Furthermore, a concern that is present in the work of many ecofeminists—that of extending our analyses to forms of oppression other than women's and nature's—may be usefully explored through this concept of the imaginary body. Indeed, although Gatens (1996) has revealed that the body politic represents a mas culine body, she is clear that it does not represent all men. She explains how differ ence cannot be acknowledged by this particular kind of masculine body that is propped up by illusions of unity. Because it sees itself as a unified whole, as telling the "whole story," anyone speaking in a different voice will be silenced as mad, hys terical, and/or irrelevant. Thus, "deviation takes the form of gibberish" (p. 26). The list of those who have been excluded at different times and places extends to "slaves, foreigners, women, the conquered, children, the working classes" (p. 23). Spelman (1982) makes a similar point that (in Western philosophy) "it is not just women who are both relegated to the bodily or passionate sphere of existence and then chastised for belonging to that sphere The images of women, slaves, labor ers, children, and animals are almost interchangeable" (p. 119). This observation is also central to Plumwood's (1993) notion of the Master Identity, which she devel ops to explain the interconnections between different forms of oppression. How ever, unlike Gatens, Plumwood does not prioritise bodily specificity as the basis on which the oppressed have been excluded.9 Perhaps a theory of embodiment that rec ognises the multiplicity of bodies could open up new areas of ecofeminist inquiry</page><page sequence="5">Field / ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 43 into the interconnectedness of oppression in terms of sex, race, class, and nature. Delores S. Williams (1993) has begun to make some of these connections in her work on the relationship between the abuse of African American women's bodies as slaves in 19th-century America and the exploitation of the natural environment in the United States today. It is worth noting that attention to bodily multiplicity does not mean that there is not an important role for sexual difference in an ecofeminist theory of embodiment. In their respective analyses, both Gatens (1996) and Grosz (1994) emphasise the multiplicity of bodies yet take account of the necessity to speak in terms of two sexes. For instance, Gatens (1996) points out that acknowledging corporeal multi plicity "is not to deny that sexual difference is a dominant organizing principle in our culture" (p. 43). Grosz (1994) also claims that sexual difference cannot be dis missed because "our conceptions of reality, knowledge, truth, politics, ethics, and aesthetics are all effects of sexually specific—and thus far in our history, usually male—bodies" (p. ix). However, both insist that recognising the way in which sex ual difference currently (and historically) operates does not equate to reifying this difference. Rather, we need to qualify our investigations into the historical realities of sexual difference with the stipulation that there are at least two kinds of bodies. Grosz (1987) suggests that the body provides a way to explain both cross-cultural commonalities and cultural and individual differences among women. She argues that "only a notion like the body—which is both universal in its generality, yet 'open' to any culture's particular significations and requirements—satisfies [the] conditions of feminist researches into women's identities" (p. 2). Having introduced some of the ways in which a deconstructive approach to the body could be of benefit to ecofeminist theorising, I now want to raise a couple of concerns with this approach from an ecofeminist perspective. The problem that I want to raise is more applicable to Grosz's, rather than Gatens's, work and concerns the following claims. Grosz (1987) asserts that "as a political object, the body is not inert or fixed. It is pliable and plastic material" (p. 3) and later speaks of "the infinite pliability of the body" (Grosz, 1994, p. 210). The idea that the body is infinitely pli able has been criticised by feminist theorist Susan Bordo (1990), who sees post modernist's scepticism about the unity and stability of identity as leading to "the dream of limitless multiple embodiments" (p. 145). Bordo cautions that "if the body is a metaphor for our locatedness in space and time and thus for the finitude of human perception and knowledge, then the postmodern body is no body at all" (p. 145).10 Ecofeminists, too, have launched criticisms against the disembodiment they detect in postmodernist and poststructuralist theory. For example, Spretnak (1991) is suspicious of what she calls "deconstructive-postmodernist" theories of the body. She argues that because deconstructive-postmodernists propose that there is "nothing beyond the cultural," the body is consequently erased in such theories (p. 122). Susan Griffin (1997) criticises poststructuralist theory for its perpetuation of the nature/language dichotomy. Listing a number of undesirable outcomes of this trend, Griffin concludes that "what is physical and of the earth seems infinitely malleable to purposes of power or even fantasy, and ultimately dispensable" (p. 216). She reminds us that language "is shaped to the human body" (p. 217). If this is so, does Grosz's idea of the infinite pliability of the body rest on a fantasy of multiple embodiments? Does she erase the body altogether in her efforts to deconstruct para digms that assume the body is a fixed object? Grosz makes a number of seemingly contradictory claims that relate to these questions. Throughout her work, Grosz, at times, steps back from her claims of "infinite pliability" for the body. For instance, she concedes that the body "is constrained by</page><page sequence="6">44 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 its biological limits—limits, incidentally, whose framework or 'stretchability' we cannot yet know, we cannot presume, even if we must presume some limits" (Grosz, 1994, p. 188). Her reluctance to specify the biological limits of the body is based on her observation that the human body is continually overcoming these lim its through, for example, its capacity to incorporate prosthetic devices. Ecofemi nists would do well to heed Grosz's point that we cannot be sure just what the body's limits might be given that there is often a tendency in ecofeminist work to emphasise the body's immanent character (e.g., in ecofeminist spirituality and in recent work such as Mellor's, which I will briefly discuss later in this article). On the other hand, Grosz's view of just what constitutes the biological limits of the body could be challenged by some of the work that ecofeminists have undertaken, which links illness to the domination of nature. Many of these ecofeminists have observed that our bodies suffer as a result of technological interventions and envi ronmental transformations that continue to "stretch" our own and the rest of the natural world's "pliability" (some of this work will be mentioned later in the Health and Healing section). Grosz (1994) acknowledges that the weakness of her inscription model is that it views the material level as "exertfing] no resistance or recalcitrance to the processes of cultural inscription" (p. 190). For example, at one point, she offers the "model of etching" as a more appropriate model for "body writing" because she is not advocating that the body is a "blank page" to be written on and a model of etch ing provides a place for specific materials and their concrete effects in the "text" that is produced (p. 191). In making these concessions, Grosz demonstrates an awareness of the problems raised by Bordo and Spretnak. That is, she recognises that the body cannot take on limitless embodiments and she seems to want to retain a role for the body's materiality in its own inscription process. However, Grosz seems to ignore her own counsel by making comments about the body's "infinite" pliability as well as the following statement, which appears in a footnote to the problems of the etching model: "Of course, even the model of etching has its prob lems: it assumes the independent préexistence of its raw materials, whereas what I want to suggest is that these very elements themselves are produced in the inscrip tive process" (p. 227). We are left with the impression that Grosz is advocating the kind of postmodernist account that is accused of erasing the body altogether. Although it is not clear how far she wants to push the idea of the body's pliability, I propose that it is the loss of the natural body, rather than the body per se, that is at issue in Grosz's (1994) account. Whereas Grosz has given extensive accounts of the way in which cultural forces interact with and work through bodies, our relation ships to natural entities and the sometimes overwhelming power of natural forces on or through our bodies are not considered in her work. Given the ecofeminist con cern that we need to rethink the human in terms that do not radically separate us from nature, how then can Grosz's view on the body, insofar as it appears to do away with the natural body altogether, be compatible with our theorising? I concede that this criticism seems counterproductive given that Grosz has worked at showing how the body is not the "purely natural" entity it is often taken to be. That is to say, she presents an account of the body that is neither naturally fixed and defining of our cultural identities nor irrelevant to them. Thus far I agree with her view. How ever, I believe that the challenge she has undertaken—to fill out the details of such a model of the body—has been hindered by her failure to seriously consider "the category of nature," despite her acknowledgment that "it is not adequate to simply dismiss the category of nature outright" (p. 21). My concern is that Grosz has not</page><page sequence="7">Field /ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 45 explored how the natural world interacts with, and works through, human bodies— how we (humans) remain "natural" at some level (even if it is impossible to deline ate this level). To use Bigwood's (1993) phrase again, the poststructuralist body has "no real terrestrial weight."11 Similar to Bigwood and Grosz, I do not want to hold onto the notion of the body as a passive receptacle of culture, or even a body as closer to nature than culture. However, my alliances are with Bigwood in her proj ect to ensure that the body retains some real terrestrial weight. Bigwood's (1991, 1993) work offers a promising start to address some of the weaknesses of Grosz's (1994) position. Bigwood argues that the body needs to be "renaturalized" so that further entrenchment in the nature/culture dichotomy is avoided and the body's "earthy significance" is maintained. Her alternative is to conceive of the body as our medium to the world in both its natural and cultural aspects. Employing a feminist reading of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body, she develops an account of the body that she describes as an "indeterminate constancy." By this, Bigwood means that our bodies are open to both historical change and cultural variation yet are incarnate enough that they are not infinitely changeable. While acknowledging that as humans we "elud[e] the simplicity of a merely physical bodily life," Bigwood (1991) stresses that "there is not a single human cultural configuration or form of behaviour that does not owe something to 'natural' existence, that is not bound up with the rest of the intersensory environs" (p. 67). Bigwood uses the term "phusical," from the Greekphusis (meaning nature), to explain a level of interaction that is taking place constantly in the natural realm. The "phusical upsurge," she says, runs through us as well. She uses the mothering body as an example to explain the way in which this phusical current entwines with the mother's and the unborn's flesh. The lack of control that a woman often experi ences during pregnancy is a response to the repression of the mothering body in patriarchal culture. According to Bigwood, it is an attempt to "revert back to her familiar ' self " rather than trusting the process that she is now firmly a part of.12 Per haps another example that describes the independence and "surprise" element of the natural force that Bigwood speaks of could be found in Susan Griffin's example of sexual experience as an event that "breaks through our illusion of separation from each other and from nature" (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990, p. 93). The experience of severe illness also could be seen in terms of the phusical current "taking over" one's body entirely. Yet it is also true that the position one creatively adopts to one's illness can influence how one experiences that illness (as well as one's recovery). Thus, in Bigwood's terms, the natural force "codetermines" the experience. The position that she is advocating here should not be interpreted as a simplistic "nature knows best" principle. Rather, her idea is one of respect for our connection to the phusical current that codetermines such experiences. From an ecofeminist perspective, Bigwood's approach achieves a more satisfactory balance of the place for both cultural and natural elements in our corporeal subjectivity. One respect in which Grosz's (1994) postmodernist account of the body poses a further challenge to ecofeminists concerns her reference to the plasticity of bodies. Arguably, attributing the quality of plasticity to bodies, as Grosz does, further strips them of any possible natural legacy. It implies an artificiality to the body's constitu tion that obscures any hint of its organic connections, let alone its structure. Although ecofeminists usually take account of the influence of social and cultural processes in the way we live and experience our bodies, there has been little consideration (prac tically none) of the ways in which our cultural artefacts also shape our embodi ment.13 Grosz raises a valid point against the tendency of many ecofeminists to</page><page sequence="8">46 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 neglect the extent to which human bodies have merged with our technologies. Donna Haraway (1990) is by far the most cited feminist writer on this topic. She criticises American radical feminists, including Susan Griffin, for restricting what we might allow as a "friendly body" to organic, as opposed to technological, meta phors (p. 216). Haraway is concerned with developing new and imaginative responses to the high-tech world we inhabit rather than retreating into Utopian dreams of organic wholeness. In other words, Haraway is sceptical of the kinds of strategies that embrace our (human) "naturalness" without also examining our "artificiality." Haraway is best known for her work on "cyborgs": part-human, part machine beings (which we already are, she says). At first glance, the suggestion that we should think of ourselves as cyborgs summons up images of artificial bodies, as does Grosz's reference to the plasticity of bodies. Are we being asked to embrace modern technology and rejoice in technological interventions in our own embodi ment?14 In a sense, this is what Haraway (1990) is asking of us; however, she is clear that she is not advocating technological imperialism in her vision of a cyborg world.15 She suggests that "from another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines"16 (p. 196). Unlike Grosz, Haraway does have an explicit eco-agenda. But she is not confident that we can realistically deal with the ecologi cal problems we face by reverting to myths of natural and organic whole ness/holism, which she sees many ecofeminists doing. She advises that "we cannot go back ideologically or materially. It's not just that 'god' is dead; so is the 'go ddess' " (p. 204). I agree with Haraway that we cannot simply ignore the extent to which our embodiment is technologised in modern Western societies. However, I remain sceptical about the consequences of formulating this into a new "cyborg feminism." I suspect that in the current climate of technological fervour it may be just a little too easy to drop the self-reflexivity that Haraway intends to accompany such a formulation. Julia Martin (1996) also raises this concern in her criticisms against Haraway's work on the basis of "the enthusiastic reception of the concept by some feminists in Europe and North America" (p. 118). Martin questions the rele vance of Haraway's emphasis on the technological reshaping of our bodies when many people in supposedly "high-tech" societies are living without even very basic technology. Indeed, thinking about the current situation in Australia, where many Aboriginal communities continue to live without access to basic sanitary facilities (including adequate water supplies), tends to make me agree with Martin's (1996) assertion that "the position from which Haraway publishes must surely appear so remote and privileged that the deconstructions it proposes can make no sense" (p. 107). Likewise, Deane Curtin (1997) observes that many technological innovations in agriculture and Green Revolution techniques have had a devastating impact on women in the Third World (p. 85). Although Haraway's (1990) position takes a critical stance on issues of disem powerment of technology and the inaccessibility to it, insofar as she presents a view of technology as inevitable and compelling, I believe that there is very little space left to develop alternatives that remain "outside the Net."17 It is one thing to accept that the more eco-socially critically aware input into technological development the better and another to close off opportunities to develop "phusical awareness" (to use Bigwood's term) because one's energies are preoccupied with the former. Hara way's work undoubtedly raises important questions about the extent to which our "naturalness" is mediated by our technologies. However, I join Irigaray in urging "First World women whose lives are caught up in cyberspace not to forget the omni</page><page sequence="9">Field / ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 47 presence of a physical world around them" (as cited in Conley, 1997, p. 146). I also support Rosemary Radford Ruether's (1992) point that although we do not need to reject high-tech innovations entirely, these do need to be "organized in relation to the biotic base of life, rather than creating the delusion that this base of life has been replaced altogether" (p. 262). In any case, Grosz's reference to the plasticity of bod ies can still be appreciated for its attempt to overcome the lure of the wholly natural, the purely organic, body—just as Haraway's cyborg metaphor is meant to provoke us to update our notions of embodiment in the modern technological world. In this sense, their work is useful for ecofeminists insofar as it confronts us with important questions regarding the extent to which our technologies and artificial environ ments shape our corporeal subjectivity and in the process mediate our relationships to the natural (and cultural) world.18 Although Grosz in particular has not provided an adequate account of the body for ecofeminists' purposes, and Haraway's work does not sit entirely comfortably with ecofeminists' concerns, their work can be seen as undertaking some of the necessary labour in order to bring ecofeminist theories on the body to fruition. So far I have only briefly mentioned ecofeminists who have attempted to theorise embodiment; now I shall consider other promising themes of embodiment that have emerged in the ecofeminist literature. These themes should be read as "loose" categories because there is a great deal of overlap between some of them. ECOFEMINIST ANALYSES OF WILDERNESS EXPERIENCES Greta Gaard's (1997) ecofeminist analysis of wilderness experiences provides a valuable model for exploring some of the ways in which our bodies are, as Gatens (1996) says, "radically open" to our surroundings. Gaard presents a detailed analy sis of the ways in which wilderness shapes human identity through, what she calls, "perceptual orienteering, a different way of locating oneself in relation to one's environment" (p. 17). The main factors that she takes into account include spatial awareness, attention to the weather, style of walking, sight, energy patterns, smell, sound, and time (pp. 17-23). Gaard's analysis is a good example of how the body can be used as a central "site of explanation."19 That is, when the body is not "put aside," as it were, and thus remains in a space outside or at least less relevant to social and cultural analyses. In contrast, Karen Warren's (1990) "rock-climbing narrative" of embodied experience does not "open out" the body to its environment as effectively as Gaard's account does. Warren sets out to show how one might conceive of oneself "as fundamentally 'in relationship with' others, including the nonhuman environ ment" (p. 135) using a narrative that explains how her approach to rock climbing changed from initially experiencing it as a challenge ("I focused all my energy on making it to the top") to an experience of care and friendship ("It felt as if the rock and I were silent conversational partners in a longstanding friendship. I realized then that I had come to care") (pp. 134-135). One of the major problems with War ren's account is that she privileges her own "felt" experience to define the relation ship with the rock.20 Although it is obvious that she can only report her own subjec tive experience, it is not obvious that the rock benefits from her change in attitude. To put it more bluntly, what difference does it make to the rock whether Warren is climbing with "intense determination" or with a "loving eye"?21 Warren seems to make the leap from expressing her own feelings to assuming that a "relationship" therefore exists between herself and the rock. She does not take the further step of</page><page sequence="10">48 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 discerning between the changes in her own feelings about the rock and how her interaction with the rock brings about these changes through an effect on the consti tution of her embodied self. She does not, in other words, allow room for the rock's "agency." Certainly, at first glance Warren's narrative does appear to offer an embodied account of her experience. For example, she notes her feelings (determination, anxiety, weariness, desperation, fright, relief, confidence, serenity, gratitude) and sensual observations ("I heard a cacophony of voices—birds, trickles of water... I closed my eyes and began to feel the rock with my hands"). However, I would argue that it is the absence of any theoretical framework of embodiment that lets Warren down in her attempts to use a personal narrative to translate personal experience into ethical deliberation. Consequently, Warren's narrative is in danger of becom ing reduced to, as Roger King (1991) suggests, "a subjective sense of aesthetic appreciation" (p. 85).22 Although pleasure in nature's aesthetic and sensual quali ties may help to develop a deeper ecological awareness, this is by no means guaran teed. Furthermore, Warren's narrative appears to rely on a notion of "pure" bodily experience in the sense that it can be described outside the context of political and social imaginaries. But, as Gatens (1996) has shown, bodily experience is always at least partially constructed by imaginaries. Gaard (1997), on the other hand, rather than focusing on a subjective account of one wilderness experience, situates her analysis within a wider framework of social meaning by highlighting the way that cultural contexts shape what might otherwise be taken as "authentic" bodily experi ences.23 For example, she points out that smells are interpreted differently in the wilderness, with unnatural "nice" body odours (i.e., perfumes) becoming possibly dangerous insofar as they might attract insects and predators. This is not to say that there is no place in an analysis of embodiment for the kind of "felt" experience that Warren presents. Indeed, there is certainly room for expanding on some of Gaard's observations about various feelings associated with different perceptual orienta tions (e.g., she contrasts the feelings of hostility and irritability that we often suffer as a result of the "noise" typical of industrial societies with the feelings of calmness that often accompany the "sounds" of wilderness). Lest it be objected that wilderness experience is also typically the domain of cer tain privileged groups, Gaard (1997) acknowledges this, arguing that instead of insisting that the kinds of changes she outlines can only take place in wilderness as currently defined, "the answer is to redefine and to increase the size of wilderness" (p. 24). I doubt that any environmentalist would object to increasing the size of wil derness but such a solution is not so easy to achieve in the way that Gaard has pre sented it. Nonetheless, her suggestion of redefining wilderness is an interesting idea that bears further consideration. It is important to note that Gaard's argument is that we need to "step into" wilderness (and presumably "step out of' our urban environments) to have the opportunity to experience the different kind of percep tual orienteering that she discusses. That is to say, it is the "otherness" of wilderness that enables this change to occur in the constitution of our embodiment and, hope fully, consequently brings about long-term change in our behaviours and attitudes. Gaard's (1997) account of perception not only has more "body weight" than does Warren's (1990) but it also has more promise for developing alternative prac tices apart from simply "reconceptualising" our beliefs, values, and attitudes (and so on). This is not to deny that reconceptualisation is part of the process of bringing about concrete change. What I am trying to emphasise is that it is a part that should not be prioritised over explorations of embodiment. Perhaps a better way to put this is that I am arguing for the need to undertake embodied explorations of the process</page><page sequence="11">Field/ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 49 of (re)conceptualisation. We need to look at the ways in which systems of power, oppressive conceptual frameworks—whatever one chooses to call them—become embodied in our daily practices. EARTH AS "BODY" A common theme running throughout ecofeminist literature involves character ising the earth as "body-like." The body and the earth are seen to be linked through similarities in their natural processes. For example, Julia Schofield Russell observes through composting that "the Earth turns everything given to it into itself, just as my body does and all living bodies do. The Earth is a living being!... It was a process of digestion that was taking place" (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990, p. 224). Although her observation that the earth is a living being could be seen as a premise of all ecofeminist positions, the way in which she imagines this being as body-like is distinctive. One problem with the use of this image is that it suggests an anthropomorphic understanding of the earth, although this may be subverted by Russell's inclusion of all living beings in her comparison. Another version of this theme is offered by Paula Gunn Allen, who informs the reader that "your body is also a planet, replete with creatures that live in and on it" (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990, p. 52). Similarly, Jean Freer tells us that "our bodies are the earth in miniature—a microcosm of the macrocosm" (as cited in Caldecott &amp; Leland, 1983, p. 133), and Marti Kheel speaks of the "inner 'environment' of the body" (as cited in Plant, 1989, p. 97). The risk of anthropomorphism also may be reduced in these versions by the emphasis on our likeness to the earth rather than the earth being depicted as similar to us. Perhaps the most pertinent point regarding observa tions of the earth as (human) body-like is that it highlights an effective way of rec ognising our own natural condition. As Russell points out, "it was this recognition [of the similarities between earthly and bodily processes] that was the great learn ing for me" (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990, p. 224). Russell explains how her views evolved, with her analysis being extended to the interconnections between our own individual bodies, the body politic, the body of humanity, and the "body of the whole Earth" (p. 227). This view is echoed by Shiva (1994), who describes the contributions in the volume of which she is editor as "relocating the terms of the discourse through a redefinition of the human body, the earth body and the body politic" (p. 3). Further on she asserts that "there are subtle and complex connections between diseases of the human body, the decay of ecosystems and the breakdown of civil society" (p. 3). Perhaps Gatens's (1996) work on the imaginary body of the "body politic" could be used to develop these ideas further. A variation on the earth "bodily" theme is often presented in the context of a par ticular kind of body. This typically takes the form of a woman's body. When the earth is envisaged as a woman's body, it (or she) is almost inevitably referred to as maternal—as Mother Earth. For example, from her original insight into the earth's body-likeness, Russell encourages the reader to view the earth as Mother Earth (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990, pp. 223, 230). Examples of maternal meta phors and imagery abound in ecofeminist literature; therefore, I will refer only briefly to some of the work here. Mother Earth is most frequently referred to as an embodied being in the work of ecofeminist spirituality. It is common in this work to refer to the body of "Great Mother Goddess" or "Gaia." Hazel Henderson speaks of "our lovely, mysterious larger body, the planet Gaia" (as cited in Caldecott &amp; Leland, 1983, p. 205), and Starhawk (1989) refers to the world as the "living body of the Goddess" (p. 178). Gaia's earthy body is portrayed by Spretnak as follows:</page><page sequence="12">50 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 What was intriguing was the sacred link between the Goddess in her many guises and totemic animals and plants, sacred groves, and womblike caves, in the moon rhythm blood of menses, the ecstatic dance—the experience of knowing Gaia, her voluptuous contours and fertile plains, her flowing waters that give her, her animal teachers, (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990, p. 5) Although there may be some benefits to picturing the earth as body-like or as a particular kind of body, we need to remain aware of the dangers of anthropomor phising both as individual natural entities and the earth as a whole. As many envi ronmental philosophers have pointed out, it is crucial that we learn to respect and relate to nonhuman nature in terms of its/their commonalties and differences to us. In other words, part of the development of an ecological consciousness should incorporate the capacity to live harmoniously among diversity, without feeling threatened by it. We may need to look a little closer at the kind of bodies that are being imagined for the earth. Following Gatens's (1996) notion of the imaginary body, which offers a useful methodology for this kind of analysis, we might con sider the following questions. Whose body/ies is/are represented in/by these imagi naries? What/who is excluded, repressed, and/or silenced in these imaginaries? What kinds of myths and fantasies are produced by these imaginaries? Despite these cautionary remarks, I contend that observing connections between the natural processes of our bodies and the earth is a potentially powerful way to raise and develop ecological awareness.24 HEALTH AND HEALING Health is a major theme throughout those ecofeminist works where the body sur faces. It is not surprising that health is raised in connection with eco-politics given the link between environmental degradation and illness. Shiva (1994) notes that "environmental hazards are also health hazards, as was so brutally revealed in Bho pal and at Love Canal. Environmental hazards are also health hazards in food sys tems. Pesticides do not merely pollute fields, they end up polluting our bodies" (p. 9). It is especially a tendency of those who embrace holistic health practices to con sider care for the environment as a necessary part of health. Some ecofeminists have shown how this also works in the reverse. That is, a holistic approach to body and health can help to heal the somataphobic attitudes we have inherited from our cul ture, which are in turn tied to our alienation from nature. This kind of healing is, arguably, more compatible with "natural" health practices than modern, orthodox Western medicine. Kheel (1989) puts forward the view that natural healing presup poses and enacts faith in nature. Nature has been seen as an "ally" by lay women healers in earlier times, and, Kheel claims, "healing was associated, in the early matriarchal cultures, with the life-giving capacities of women" (p. 97). She com pares this view, where the body's own healing energy is fortified through the use of natural substances from the earth, with "modern drug-oriented medicine [which] derives from dualistic ideas . . . [and is] founded upon a distrust of nature and nature's power to heal" (p. 98). Kheel discusses the mind/body dualism characteris tic of modern medicine, which sees the rational (masculine) mind as possessing the power to heal the "body machinery" (pp. 98-99). Modern medicine, Kheel argues, "wages war" against disease with the body as a battlefield.25 There are a number of interesting implications that emerge from Kheel's argu ment. The connection between our (human) bodies and nature and the naturalness of our bodies is accentuated. It suggests that a change in attitudes toward nature will</page><page sequence="13">Field / ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 51 necessarily be accompanied by a change in attitudes toward our bodies. What is also made clear is the role of our bodies in learning to put into practice a commit ment to healing our alienation from nature. Without going so far as to say one must choose natural healing if one is to prove their eco-commitment (although Kheel might see this as the ideal), such an account situates the body as central to human relationships with nature. Indeed, Ynestra King (as cited in Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990) claims that "to the extent that we make our own flesh an enemy, or docilely submit ourselves to medical experts, we are participating in the domination of nature" (p. 119). The theme of restoring faith in the body as part of a healthier relationship to nature is also evident in the work of Susan Griffin and Charlene Spretnak (both cited in Y. King, 1989). Griffin writes, "the singing in my body daily returns me to a love of this earth. I know that by a slow practice, if I am to survive, I must learn to lis ten to this song" (p. 17). Spretnak, as mentioned earlier, speaks of "body parables" and "body truth" as expressions of the "realities" of oneness, interconnectedness, and holism (p. 129). There are, however, problems with this idea of developing faith in one's body. This concerns the assumption of authenticity, which I raised earlier in relation to Warren's work. Griffin's and Spretnak's comments can be read as sug gesting that one can access a level of "truth" or "reality" through one's bodily expe riences.26 Rather than emphasising only the harmonious experiences, such as "one ness with the cosmic whole," or interpreting bodily experiences as some kind of message of "truth," perhaps a more realistic way to view our bodily being in the world is that described by Allen (1990). Allen's approach is more grounded in that she suggests "staying in your body, accepting its discomforts, decayings, wither ings, and blossomings and respecting them" (p. 52). Such an approach does not seem to glorify the body as much as Spretnak's work, in particular, seems to sug gest. Indeed, if we are to overcome our somatophobia it seems that it is these more mundane and inconvenient aspects of our bodily being that we need to come to terms with. Another common theme that links the body, health, and nature is concerned with women's reproductive experiences. A number of contributors to Leonie Caldecott's and Stephanie Leland's (1983) collection of essays, Reclaim the Earth, address issues concerning women's reproductive health. For example, Caroline Wynd ham's essay aims to show that "the experience of giving birth provides a focus for exploring a woman's relationship to her own body" (as cited in Caldecott &amp; Leland, 1983, p. 174). Contrasting her own two very different birthing experiences, she urges that centres need to be available to provide women with opportunities for positive birthing experiences. Thus, Wyndham shows how women's "life-giving capacities" (to use Kheel's phrase) can be affirmed in alternative settings. Y. King (1989) also sees the feminist health movement as "potentially, one of the best exam ples of an appropriately mediated, dialectical relationship to nature," especially through its reappropriation and demedicalization of childbirth (p. 133). These views seem to allow at least some role for Western medicine in the development of body-honouring health practices, as long as the situation is one of empowerment for, in this case, the women involved. Reproductive issues are also central to the way in which environmental "mes sages" are "read" from women's bodies. In Irene Diamond's and Gloria Orenstein's introduction to Reweaving the World (1990), the editors claim a special role for women's bodies in environmental matters. They point out that women's bodies "are important markers" of environmental stress, for example, in the form of miscar riage (p. x). In a chapter in the same book, Lin Nelson further discusses how infertil</page><page sequence="14">52 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 ity, contaminated breast milk, and birth defects in babies are also taken as indicators of environmental problems. However, she warns that the use of women's bodies as biological markers and as points of data collection (e.g., in research on lactation) is often based on stereotypes of women's "delicate biology" (p. 182). Nelson points out that women often become scapegoats, with environmental health problems being seen as "something women are particularly vulnerable around and/or worried about" (p. 182). Diamond (see Diamond &amp; Orenstein, 1990) also warns against using babies as "canaries" and subsequently contributing to the increasing use of prenatal and genetic screening. She argues that these techniques serve only to increase "the power of heroic experts" through the use of reproductive technologies as the solution, thereby hiding the damage that is done and allowing the continua tion of "the poisoning of the Earth" (p. 210). It is certainly interesting that although men's fertility rates are also a good indication of environmental hazards, the inci dence of infertility in men does not seem to be taken as a sign of their "fragility" or as a cause for social concern. Again using Gatens's terminology, we might say that these stereotypes shape the kinds of imaginary bodies that underlie such readings. Nonetheless, we cannot dismiss the ways in which environmental disasters are played out specifically through women's bodies. Not only are women subject to health risks that affect everyone, but they carry the added burden of dealing with risks to fetal health (with huge emotional costs involved) as well as becoming pawns in political battles over supposed concern for fetal welfare. The political nature of women's bodies in environmental issues is highlighted in a number of essays in Caldecott's and Leland's book (1983). For example, one of the issues that the Women's Working Group on Seveso has made clear is how environmental deg radation specifically affects women's bodies through endangering fetal develop ment. This chapter describes how women, in the case study discussed, were caught in the political crossfire over the issue of abortion in cases of fetal abnormalities due to a toxic "accident."27 What these essays show is the way in which the woman-nature connection spe cifically operates through women's bodies. Women's reproductive capacities and experiences are a fundamental part of this process. It is perhaps no surprise, to eco feminists at least, that patriarchal control of women's "life-giving capacities" has extended from the systematic sabotage of their roles as healers to the usurpation of their reproductive power through biotechnology. Although women's roles as heal ers have historically been devalued and undermined by modern medicine (and the church), the recovery of this role is promoted by many ecofeminists, particularly those working in the area of ecofeminist spirituality. Apart from these empirical examples, many ecofeminists have argued that somatophobia is not due only to a fear (and loathing) of the body in general but that it is fuelled also by a fear and hatred of women's bodies in particular. Carol P. Christ (1982) claims that "changing cultural attitudes toward the female body could go a long way toward overcoming the spirit-flesh, mind-body dualisms of Western cul ture, since, as Ruether (1992) has pointed out, the denigration of the female body is at the heart of these dualisms" (p. 80). Spretnak's (1991) comment that "in general, women raised under patriarchy receive the message from myriad sources that we have the wrong body to be taken seriously in matters of culture, commerce, medi cine, government, and so forth" (p. 119) supports Gatens's (1996) conclusions regarding the lack of representation of women's bodies by/in the body politic. The solutions put forward by Christ and Spretnak, both spiritual ecofeminists, involve a</page><page sequence="15">Field/ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 53 process of healing that will empower women through the acceptance and celebra tion of their bodies. BODY-HONOURING SPIRITUALITY Spretnak (1993) explains that body-honouring spirituality recognises "both nature and the body as sacred and as sources of spiritual revelation" (p. 261). Christ (1982) sees an important implication of the Goddess symbol for women as "the affirmation of the female body and the life cycle expressed in it," thus recovering the value of that which has been used to denigrate women through "cultural and religious taboos surrounding menstruation, childbirth, and menopause" (pp. 77-78). She compares Christianity, where the positive female image is the Virgin Mary who "is revered because she, in her perpetual virginity, transcends the carnal sexuality attributed to most women," to Goddess spirituality where the "female body is viewed as the direct incarnation of the waxing and waning, life and death cycles in the universe" (e.g., 28-day menstruation/moon cycle) (pp. 78-79). Many spiritual ecofeminists recommend the use of rituals to celebrate menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, the mother/daughter relationship, and the wisdom of old women. How ever, recognising the particular way in which the devaluation of women's bodies underlies the somataphobic attitudes of our culture does not mean that only women need to "get in touch" with their bodies. Spretnak (1991) points out that the "ritual arts of Goddess spirituality have attracted men as well as women" (p. 155) and claims that the ritual process "often expands the awareness of one's bodily pres ence, along with all the other bodily presences within the circle" (p. 145). Much of Starhawk's (1989) work focuses on the connection of bodies in general (i.e., both women and men) to the earth. In describing the essential elements of ritual, Star hawk identifies "grounding" as the foremost component. She says, "For a ritual to be powerful, we must start grounded, stay grounded, and end grounded, because the power that we raise comes into our bodies through the earth, and then returns to the earth" (p. 327). All of us, men and women, need to recognise the links between our bodies and the living earth and the implications of this for well-being.28 One avenue to explore these links may be through the theme of immanence. IMMANENCE AND EMBODIED MATERIALISM There are a number of embodiment issues that can be investigated under the theme of immanence. Already a major theme in spiritual ecofeminism, immanence is now being rethought in recent ecofeminist work. For example, Mary Mellor (1997) proposes that the notion of transcendence (vs. immanence) provides a better alternative to anthropocentrism in terms of explaining human alienation from nature. She argues that some people can live as though they are able to transcend nature more easily than others. That is, they are able to deny their immanence more easily than others. This illusion of transcendence is closely tied to the sexual divi sion of labour. Mellor points out that women do the vast majority of work in the sphere of immanence. Susan Griffin ( 1982), who Mellor identifies as being influen tial on her own ideas, sees the sexual division of labour as instrumental in maintain ing men's illusions that they do not have bodies or are masters of their bodies. Grif fin makes her point vividly in the following passage:</page><page sequence="16">54 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 When a man is hungry, a woman prepares the meal. When he defecates, a woman cleans the toilet Thus, a man can live his whole life with a disdain for the sim ple needs of the human body, and for the labour needed to sustain that body. (p. 15) Griffin (1982) acknowledges the class differences among men and notes that to the extent that a man is part of the ruling class his work outside the home will involve less direct material experience (p. 16). But it is important to note that the degree to which women have been involved in the immanent sphere of work also has been divided historically along class (and race) lines. That is to say, certain women have had their "bodily needs" looked after by other women. Furthermore, with the increase of women in the paid workforce, particularly in "professional" (less "materially" oriented) occupations, there has been a growing industry of women providing "immanent" services (e.g., housework, child care) for other women. Although it is important to take account of these differences between women's immersion in the sphere of immanence, it is also crucial not to lose sight of the different ways in which women and men inhabit these spheres. Thus, even an upper class woman who is either not required to work or whose work requires little direct material experience will always be situated in the sphere of immanence in relation to the men whose class she shares. Similarly, Salleh (1997) explores the notion of "embodied materialism," introducing the notions of "holding labour," "enduring time," and "barefoot epistemology" to explain the embodied materialism of women and oppressed Others. Salleh argues that the kind of work that women have traditionally undertaken (e.g., nurturing, cleaning, cooking) provides both a grounds for critique of Eurocentric capitalist patriarchal society and a model for alternative practices. It is, she argues, the "lived contradiction" of the day-to-day experiences of women and oppressed Others that provides the basis from which insights, leading to political action, can arise. While acknowledging differences among our experiences, we need to develop a sense of our immanence as humans and question the myth of transcendence that drives the predominant lifestyle images produced by modern, Western, capitalist societies. But this awareness needs to be developed within a certain context. After all, Simone de Beauvoir and Shulamith Firestone interpreted their awareness of women's immanence as a hindrance to our liberation and therefore something to be overcome. We need to think about the consequences that the myth of transcendence has had on the entire living world, and if this is too broad to contemplate, then per haps we could start by considering our own bodily being at an individual level. One way to encourage an awareness of our immanence is through reflection on our reli ance on nature for basic needs such as food, warmth, clothing, and shelter. Spretnak (1993) suggests that we need to acknowledge with "humility and care" that which we must take from nature (p. 269). Bigwood (1993) makes a similar recommenda tion that "it is, perhaps, especially in our most basic bodily activities like preparing our food that self-criticality is necessary" (p. 103). Ruether (1992) stresses that men, especially, "need to do regularly what they have hardly ever done, even in preagricultural societies: feed, clothe, wash, and hug children from infancy, cook food, and clean up wastes" (p. 266). A further way in which to think about the tangible effects of transcendence as a mode of living can be found in Mellor's (1997) idea of immanent versus transcen dent time. It is a common complaint in modern industrial societies that there is "never enough time." We expect our bodies to operate according to artificially imposed temporal measures and wonder why our bodies eventually "rebel." One might consider it a sad truth that many people need to become ill before they are</page><page sequence="17">Field/ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 55 able to acknowledge that they need time to replenish. In fact, illness is one of the surest ways to remind ourselves of our immanence. Unfortunately, this kind of realisation often amplifies one's fears and hatred of the body rather than leading to greater respect for one's immanent being. Mellor suggests that we need to follow immanent time in order to revitalise ourselves and to heal our alienation from nature. This idea has some resonance with a number of the themes in Bigwood's (1993) work. For example, in a discussion of the exclusion of the feminine from "western Being," she points out that "revealing feminine absencing may involve ways of living and thinking that are seemingly vulnerable, backward, inefficient, use-less in the face of the progressive external ordering of the world," yet this is cru cial to "become open to nonhuman otherness" (p. 103). The idea of immanence raises questions about the consequences of following our capacity to transcend our "naturalness" to its ultimately destructive end—in terms of our own, and the entire planet's, well-being. CONCLUSION In this article, I have attempted to show that the body is essential for ecofemi nism—but in a dramatically different way than it is usually characterised. The body is essential for ecofeminism because it needs to be recovered from its devalued position in our somatophobic culture, it provides a way to deconstruct phallocentric metaphysics, it is compatible with a politics of locatedness and accountability, it has the ability to empirically manifest (at times) the consequences of our domina tion of nature, and it can allow for the acknowledgment of multiplicity while also remaining committed to explanations based on sexual difference. Finally, the body is essential for ecofeminism because it can be used to overcome the major problems associated with essentialism. Although many of the existing ecofeminist approaches to the body point to use ful future directions, we need to engage seriously with the work of those feminist theorists who have problematised long-standing and entrenched assumptions regarding embodiment that still inform some ecofeminists' work. Theorists such as Gatens and Grosz have investigated the ways in which social and cultural practices define different bodies, designate what they can do, and conversely, how bodies adopt or reject these definitions. These approaches deny that the body can be situ ated as separate from social processes yet do not (necessarily) view the body as nothing more than a product of social processes. Although I have expressed some concerns regarding this latter tendency, particularly in Grosz's work, I have empha sised the "natural" limits of the deconstructive potential of the body. Thus, the deconstructive approach that I have explored prioritises the recovery of the body from its marginal status while remembering that this cannot be properly realised without also revealing the inadequacies of binary divisions (e.g., mind/body, con ceptual/material) to account for embodied experience. This also applies to the (mis guided) attempt to recover the body by "simply" deconstructing dualisms.29 As well as learning from feminist theorists on the body, I suggest that an eco feminist theory of embodiment will benefit from bringing together the philosophical and empirical investigations relating to embodiment that have so far been under taken. Bigwood's work represents one of the ways in which this can be done. Simi lar to Gatens and Grosz, Bigwood uses the body as a terrain to "open out" her theo rising, with the advantage of rectifying some of the deficiencies (from an ecofeminist perspective) in their work. An embodied ecofeminism, such as Big wood's, brings together environmental theory (as concerned with nature), feminist</page><page sequence="18">56 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 theory on the body (which otherwise rejects, or at least neglects, our indeterminate "naturalness"), and phenomenology of the body (which has traditionally neglected women's bodies). Given that it is our bodies that have situated us as "mere" nature, animality, flesh, immanence, I suggest that it is to our bodies that we should turn to rethink these notions. This needs to be done in such a way that our enmeshment in artificial and technological "landscapes" is taken into account, but not at the expense of the "phusical" elements of our embodiment. Thinking through embodiment from an ecofeminist perspective also needs to be situated within a framework of a critical analysis of the social and political imaginaries that contributes to the constitution of our embodiment. In all these ways, the body is essential, that is, indispensable, to ecofeminism. NOTES I. Ecofeminists have responded in a number of different ways to the portrayal of eco feminism as a form of radical/cultural feminism that is allegedly essentialist. Some have stressed ecofeminism's distance from radical/cultural and essentialist feminist positions (e.g., Merchant, 1992; Plumwood, 1986,1993; Warren, 1987, 1993), whereas others (e.g., Birkeland, 1993; Griffin, 1997;Salleh, 1991) have engaged more directly with the essential ist charges against ecofeminism. 2.1 borrow the term "think through the body" from Jane Gallop (1988). 3. Spivak (1994) suggests that if antiessentialism is often a way of avoiding doing one's homework, then once we open up to the possibility of differences between various alleged essentialist positions, we need to do our homework in order to explain these differences. In other words, insisting on attention to differences in the essentialist debate prevents, or at least undermines, the use of the essentialist charge as an "infallible critique." 4. Spivak (1994) suggests that "if one begins to see what words one could use in the place of essentialism or essence many, many words would come in" (p. 156). 5. The term "terrestrial weight" is one I have found to be useful for expressing that ele ment that I find missing from much theorising on embodiment. The reference occurs throughout Bigwood's book Earth Muse: Feminism, Nature, and Art (1993). 6. Although I do not argue for this position here, I see Plumwood and Warren as "phi losophising despite the body" rather than theorising embodiment (also see Note 9). 7. Grosz (1994) addresses the politics of "seminal fluids" in a brief but interesting dis cussion. She suggests that men distance themselves from the kind of corporeality implied by the flow of seminal fluids—"uncontrollable, excessive, expansive, disruptive, irrational"— that is, the kind of corporeality attributed to women. Rather, men's body fluids are reduced to "the by-products of pleasure and the raw materials of reproduction" (pp. 198-202). 8. Note that Iris Marion Young (1990) is clear that "giving voice to a specifically female desire" is not to suggest that it exists "as a pure and authentic female core" (beneath phallo centric desire) but rather that it "must be made up, and its making is itself a political strategy" (p. 193). This view is also shared by both Irigaray and Bigwood. 9. This is not to say that Plumwood's (1993) account is wrong in this regard but it is the lack of embodiment in her theorising that creates a number of problems from an ecofeminist perspective, including some of the problems I have raised in this article regarding an overem phasis on "reconceptualisation" as a strategy to resolve the "logic of dualism." 10. Nonetheless, Bordo ( 1993) points out that she is not entirely negative about the possi bilities of postmodernism and poststructuralism in terms of the body. She identifies, for example, bell hooks's Yearning and Jane Flax's Thinking Fragments as models for an "embodied postmodernism" (p. 40). II. Note that, in their criticisms of the loss of the body, Griffin and Bigwood refer to post structuralism, Spretnak refers to deconstructive-postmodernism, and Bordo is concerned</page><page sequence="19">Field/ECOFEMINISM AND THE BODY 57 with postmodernism. Bordo (1993) makes the distinction between postmodernist and post structuralist thought—that the former includes many ideas that have developed out of the lat ter, whereas not all poststructuralist thought is necessarily postmodern (p. 3 8). I am not inter ested here in exploring the finer details of these distinctions. Suffice it to say that Grosz's work could probably be placed in more than one, if not all, of these categories, depending on who is making the distinction. 12. Young (1990) describes this situation similarly (p. 167). 13. That is to say, most ecofeminists do not advocate biologically determined explana tions of bodily experiences. However, attention to the influence of social and cultural processes on bodily experiences does not necessarily produce adequate theories of embodi ment, as I am arguing in this article. 14. Elsewhere I have begun to address some of the problems raised by our relationships with artificial environments and technology in the context of a relational concept of self (Field, 1998). 15. Haraway (1978) criticises Shulamith Firestone for advocating that women's libera tion depended on the emancipatory powers of technology, particularly with respect to repro duction. Haraway points out that Firestone's argument, which "prepared for the logic of domination of technology," was based on the mistaken premise "that there are natural objects (bodies) separate from social relations" (p. 25). 16. The potential for developing an ecofeminist account of embodiment concerning the relationship between women and animals might be drawn from the work of ecofeminists writing about the abuse and mistreatment of animals—-from experimentation to meat-eating (e.g., Adams, 1991; Gaard, 1993; Kheel, 1985; Slicer, 1991). Plumwood's (1992) discussion of kinship ethics and Norma Benney's (as cited in Caldecott &amp; Leland, 1983) discussion of women as nonhumans and the exploitation of female animals also would be helpful here. 17. Susan Leigh Star (as cited in Lykke &amp; Braidotti, 1996) recounts an incident about warnings being issued by a state park in the United States concerning wild mountain lions being "loose" in the vicinity. It turned out that "loose" meant that two lion cubs had not yet been electronically tagged. Star muses on this new definition of "wild nature" based on being "outside the Net" (pp. 38-39). I therefore want to appropriate this phrase and suggest that there may be definite advantages to remaining "outside the Net." 18.1 have begun to address some of these issues in "Caring Relationship with Natural and Artificial Environments" (see Field, 1995). 19.1 borrow this phrase from Payne (1994), although it can also be seen to reflect the approach of early feminists who identified the body as a "site of political struggle." Payne's wider focus in this article is on recontextualising Warren's narrative in order to take account of the "dynamic of temporal, spatial, and symbolic structures constituted by agents' actions in the socio-environmental lifeworld" (p. 140). Elsewhere, Payne (1997) undertakes an equally revealing critique of kayaking for its purported role in raising ecological consciousness. 20. Payne (1994) makes a similar comment in his criticisms of the way in which Warren links environmental concerns to an emancipatory view of leisure through her emphasis on " 'the felt' of felt, lived experience" (p. 146). I am indebted to Payne's critique for clarifying a number of my own ideas and concerns about Warren's narrative. 21. Roger King (1991) raises a similar objection. He asks what "is gained by the meta phors of conversation, partnership, and friendship when these are taken out of their human context and when the only speaker and ultimate beneficiary is still the human climber?" (p. 85). Haraway also questions the "problem of ventriloquism," speaking for nature (as pointed out by Lykke &amp; Braidotti, 1996, p. 244) (see also Sylvia Bowerbank's chapter in Lykke and Brai dotti [1996] titled "Does Woman Speak for Nature? Towards a Genealogy of Ecological Feminisms"). 22. It is worth noting that Bigwood also uses personal narrative in her work. However, although Bigwood's excerpts provide effective illustrations for the more strictly academic text of her book, they are not, I would argue, "mere" illustrations. That is, they are an integral part of the rest of the text. But neither are her narratives presented as a substitution for theo</page><page sequence="20">58 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2000 rising on embodiment. This is to not say that Bigwood's is the only way to approach an eco feminist theory of embodiment. For example, Susan Griffin's work provides another instance of what I would call "embodied writing." 23. I'd also like to acknowledge the importance of Warren's (1990) piece insofar as she has undertaken some of the groundwork necessary to explore and further develop the more rigorous theorising on embodiment that I envisage in this article. 24. Ebenreck (1996) discusses the difference between "imaginative empathy" and "sim ple anthropomorphizing" of the nonhuman world, concluding that the former definitely has an important role in environmental ethics. 25. Kheel (1989) also points out that "two of the weapons used in the 'war' against cancer are nitrogen mustard and radiation, both weapons used during the last world wars" (p. 99). She also draws attention to the abuse inflicted on animals' bodies by modern, Western medi cine, particularly in pharmaceutical research. Kheel notes that drug companies claim simi larities between humans' and nonhumans' bodies when they want to market a drug tested on animals and yet they are quick to deny those similarities when adverse reactions occur (p. 106). Of course, the denial of similarities is used to justify their abuse on the grounds that "animals do not experience pain like humans do." 26. This tendency is most evident in Spretnak's (1991) work. For example, in describing the kinds of feelings and beliefs that motivate an interest in "contemporary renaissance of Goddess spirituality," she includes the following remark: "We longed for authenticity, the truth of our being" (p. 149). This is not to discredit the integrity of the experiences reported by Spretnak, or any of the other authors mentioned, but just to point out that there may be other, neglected, ways to express embodied spiritual experiences in connection with nature. 27. The toxic "accident" in question was an explosion at a chemical plant in Seveso in northern Italy in 1976. The chapter in Caldecott and Leland (1983) is an extract from a book let compiled by a feminist group in Geneva shortly after the accident. 28. "Well-being" is a common term used by advocates of natural healing to describe good health. It does seem to be a more appropriate term to describe a view on health that extends beyond the individual level and encompasses nonhuman entities more easily than does the term "health." 29.
