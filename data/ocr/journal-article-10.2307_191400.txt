<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPECTER OF COMMUNISM MATTHEWKRAMER Cambridge University T HIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS on a small set of writings grouped under the signature of G. A. Cohen. Chief among these texts is Karl Marx's Theory of History,' a tour de force of the analytic style of philosophizing that has prevailed in Great Britain and the United States for the better part of this century. Cohen's book has been hailed as "a more sophisticated interpretation of historical materialism than any we have had before,"2 and its publication in 1978 brought its author into the front rank of Anglo-American exegetes of Marx. Even those reviews strongly critical of Cohen's theory have lavished praise on its virtues. Above all, his book has been praised for its lucidity and its brilliance, yet these two qualities do not coexist in quite as untroubled a relation as one might think. My reading of Cohen's work will cut across his lucidity and his brilliance; the brilliant glare and powerful exuberance of his prose may generate blindness, blindness that will put into question the supposed luculence of his analytical scheme. This conflict between insight and clarity will take an especially acute form in light of Cohen's fierce rigor - another quality of his book that has been highly commended. It is the care and the scrupulous precision with which the book is argued that should make its blind spots all the more dazzling.3 Like a modem Ezekiel, Cohen hopes to breathe life into the dry bones of "an old-fashioned historical materialism" with the bracing winds of analytic philosophy.4 In restating Marx's theory of history, Cohen eschews reliance on any dialectical modes of interpretation; he employs the word "dialectic" only a few times and always with condescending quotation marks. With only a few curtly treated exceptions, Cohen ignores all Marxists outside Anglo- AUTHOR'S NOTE: This essay amounts to roughly one third of a long chapter on Cohen's work in my recently completed book Legal Theory, Political Theory, and Deconstruction: Against Rhadamanthus (forthcoming, Indiana University Press). I have made some modifications in the text, and I have pared or eliminated some of the footnotes. I wish to thank G. A. Cohen, William Connolly, Nigel Simmonds, and an anonymous reader for very helpful comments.

In Cohen's view, all such thinkers fail to attain the virile clarity of the analytic philosopher. Theirs is the more effete task of demonstrating "how elegantly - and evasively - the French [or German] language [can] be used."5(Lest the preceding two sentences appear unfair or ad hominem, it should be mentioned that Cohen's book is overwhelmingly masculine in tone. Cohen invariably employs male pronouns, and virtually all his illustrative examples involve men. His few examples involving women pertain to marital relations or to sexual intercourse. When, in a later essay, Cohen denounces "the sexist personification of humanity which Marxists have not always avoided,"6 he sounds not unlike Oedipus condemn- ing the man who murdered Laius.) Of little interest here is the "faithfulness" (or absence of "faithfulness") achieved by Cohen in his interpretation of Marx. Although Marx's writings will be by no means off limits, this essay will not primarily be concerned with questions of so-called accuracy -the accuracy of Cohen's representa- tion of important Marxian ideas.7 Such questions are not completely incon- sequential; after all, the more faithful Cohen's writings have been, the more far-reaching will be the implications of my critique. Marxism more generally will be placed in question. Be that as it may, however, the whole issue of faithfulness or accuracy seems largely devoid of meaning or at least out of place, for reasons hinted at in my hyphenating the word "representation." To represent something accurately is to present it once again, to recapture its original presence in a signified form. But, as will here be demonstrated, Marxist priorities can never become present in a straightforward or un- problematic way. They must obscure themselves in the very motion of presenting themselves. Because Cohen's argument will have dislodged its own values, questions of faithfulness will be indefinitely postponed. For similar reasons, we shall not explicitly render judgment-except once, en passant -on the adequateness of Cohen's Marxism as an account of human history. His book has been subjected to often powerful criticisms on this score, in particular to the charge that Cohen has generalized unduly from the dynamic structure of capitalist society to sweeping theses about the whole of human development.8 Such criticisms, however cogent, feed too comfortably off the metaphysical tradition that has informed Cohen's work. Because the "general text" of all history is a "fabric of traces referring endlessly to something other than itself' and "overrun[ning] all the limits assigned to it,"9 we should not expect to unearth a bedrock of hard facts in socioeconomic life against which Cohen's ideas could be assessed. If Cohen's stance does indeed approximate that which we call "reality," it</page><page sequence="3">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 609 perhaps most strikingly does so when it most uncannily works to undermine itself. Hereafter, this essay is divided into two parts. The first gives an outline of Cohen's principal arguments relating to his so-called Primacy Thesis. My exposition will, of course, be tendentious - as are all expositions - but it will not be unfair. Critical remarks on specific matters will be put forward throughout Part I. No full-scale critique is ventured until Part II, however. There we shall probe certain points of conflict between Cohen's mode of expression (or the way his text works) and his prime substantive themes (or what his text says). The basic conclusion of Part II, and of this entire essay, may be pointedly summarized as follows: If Marxism is profoundly unsatis- fying, that is because it stays unattuned to its own aporias. L A CRITICAL EXPOSITION OF COHEN'S ARGUMENTS A. The Material and the Social Before moving to the heart of his lengthy argument, Cohen takes some time to distinguish carefully between the material and the social aspects of production. He points up the advisability of a painstaking division between the social and the material sides of life by adducing some passages from Marx that ostensibly display needless confusion in identifying the chief constitu- ents of productive processes. At some points, Marx described productive forces (within specific forms of society) as relations; in other places, he described them as things. Capital, for instance, was sometimes represented as a "social production relation," and at other times as things (or a thing) "in certain relations."'0 For a post-structuralist, these clashing formulations present no grave difficulty that has to be clarified or resolved. They should be regarded as the self-unraveling poles - poles of identity and difference - between and within which all social theory must pendulate. Capital exists, necessarily, both as (1) an effect of social relations that precede it in a logical sense as well as in a temporal order, and as (2) an element, or a set of elements, that precedes and (in combination with other elements) brings forth the relations that construct social life. Shuttling between accounts of capitalism that highlight elements and other accounts that highlight structures, and giving prominence to the stark complicity between such accounts, would be the only way to do justice to the aporias that constitute and derange them.</page><page sequence="4">610 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 Cohen, however, takes a different view. He chides those who would adopt a stance similar to the one just outlined. As was remarked earlier, Cohen flinches from anything that smacks of dialectical thought. On entering production relations, persons and productive forces receive the imprint of the form those relations constitute: a Negro becomes a slave, a machine becomes a portion of constant capital. Those who favour "dialectical" language might say: a Negro is and is not a slave, a machine is and is not capital. But these are evasive declarations. The right course is to try to express Marx's distinction as clearly as possible.1' Cohen concludes that Marx was simply in error when he sometimes described capital as a set of social relationships. Correctly viewed, capital is a "set of means of production ... which has assumed a certain social character."'12 Cohen backs up his favored definition by pointing to a dichotomy that received pride of place in most of Marx's theoretical schemes: the social versus the material. It is by keeping a sharp disjuncture between these spheres that we can avoid further bemusement in analyzing capitalism. Cohen formulates the disjuncture through the following definition of sociality: a description of a social phenomenon or event will attribute to a person or set of persons-whether specified or not-formal rights or effective powers (over assets of any kind) vis-a-vis other persons. Accounts of some aspect of society that do not entail ascription of rights or powers can be referring only to the material side of life.'3 Cohen's sociality/materiality dyad can translate smoothly into a form/sub- stance or culture/nature diremption. Each of these can be mapped easily onto the well-known Marxian distinction between productive forces and produc- tion relations. Not analogous, however, is the perceived split between mind (or mental life) and matter (or the physical world); Cohen subsumes most branches of scientific knowledge - every branch, that is, which "contributes to production in virtue of the material character of production" -into the broader group of productive forces, which are all material in the sense relevant here, "though they are of course not [all] material in a more familiar sense of that term."'14 Nor are all types of economic relationships to be categorized as social. Cohen classifies work relations as material - notwith- standing his view that such relations do not qualify for a place in the elite company of "productive forces."'6 In addition, Cohen invites us to take account of "material relations between producing units," on which he pro- vides this gloss: "Thus it is a material fact that shoes produced by A protect the feet of B who produces a shirt to be worn by C who produces wheat consumed when A eats a bun, whatever may be the social mechanism (market, plan, custom, etc.) mediating these material connections."' 6</page><page sequence="5">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 611 Cohen realizes, of course, that material production can never occur outside social forms, any more than a piece of granite can fail to have some shape or another. He also recognizes - indeed, insists - that one cannot draw deductive inferences from material conditions to social frameworks. In other words, no set of productive forces ever entails any specific social constella- tion. Nonetheless, even if "content cannot exist without form ... that does not diminish its importance.... [C]ontent may be described in illuminating abstraction from the form with which it is integrated.""' And even if the productive forces cannot settle the exact lineaments of an economic structure, there remain "important non-deductive [i.e., non-necessary] inferences from material to social properties."'8 Here we come to the central argument of Cohen's book. B. The Primacy Argument Cohen's chief purpose in starkly separating life's social dimension from its material dimension is to assert the dominance of the latter over the former. He does this with two closely related theses: (1) a "Development Thesis," which postulates that productive forces tend to develop during the course of human history, and (2) the "Primacy Thesis" proper, which maintains that the character of the production relations in a given society is traceable to the stage of evolution - and to the need for further development - of the society's productive forces.'9 Productive forces perform two key roles in Cohen's Primacy Thesis.'" On the one hand, the level to which the forces have developed will cause specific networks of production relations to be more suitable than other possible networks for promoting further development. On the other hand, as was just stated, it is the further growth of productive power that commands most attention in the Primacy Thesis; if existing levels of forces tend to make only some sets of relations optimal, then theftuture level of forces is precisely that in regard to which judgments of optimality are made. Both the level and the continuation of productive development must be taken into account. As we might have anticipated, the second factor- that of enhancing or maximizing the rate of change of productive forces - receives the bulk of Cohen's attention throughout Karl Marx's Theory of History. Very little is argued there, save in Chapter VII and (to a lesser degree) in Chapter XI, with regard to the first factor: that of the relation between levels of development and the optimality of particular economic structures for continued development. By "development" of productive forces, Cohen means that ever more surplus is producible as time marches on. An equivalent way of expressing</page><page sequence="6">612 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 what he means is that "less direct labour is required in order to make a larger product [of essential goods]."2' (The actualized level of key products need not grow, so long as the ratio of possible labor time to necessary labor time is increasing.) Cohen does not commit himself to defending the proposition that the potential surplus product grows constantly. There exists only a tendency - affirmed in the Development Thesis - for the productive forces to move ahead; any number of circumstances may thwart the realization of such a tendency. Nor does Cohen insist that changes in the means of production inevitably produce corresponding changes in economic regimes. Some mutations are far too limited to have such an effect. All Cohen affirms is that "for any set of production relations, there is an extent of further development of the productive forces they embrace which sufflces for a change in those relations, and . . . that further development tends to occur. But how large the development must be will vary from case to case."22 How, then, does Cohen argue for his two theses? At first striving to amass evidence that each thesis played a prominent role in Marx's "mature" writings, Cohen then proceeds to "a more venturesome and perhaps fool- hardy business, namely, to assemble some reasons for thinking the theses are true."23 We shall begin, as Cohen does, by looking at the Development Thesis. 1. Human Nature, Rationality, and Development. Cohen grounds his argument in a specific theory of human nature and human rationality. He knows that his belief in a transhistorical "human nature" will disconcert many Marxists, but he declares: "It must be agreed that there are enduring facts of human nature."24 Although he makes a half-hearted attempt to lend this statement some argumentative backing, his main source of support is the conviction that no sensible person could disagree with him: "[T]he contribu- tion of biology will have to be acknowledged."' Having laid down the law on the acceptability of "human nature," Cohen explains the pertinence of this concept for the claim that productive forces tend to progress through history. He presents us with what he calls "three facts"26: (1) People are rational, in the sense that they know how to fulfill their needs by appropriating and utilizing productive forces. (2) The history of humankind is characterized by scarcity. By this, Cohen means that people can satisfy their wants only if they expend a great deal of time and effort in work that is not thought of as a good in itself. (3) People can reflect and build on the knowledge that has been bequeathed to them by their predecessors. Gains in knowledge frequently lend themselves to productive use, and are very often perceived as being useful in this respect. Taken together, Cohen's three facts lead us to conclude that some version of the Development Thesis must be true if we are to uphold human rationality.</page><page sequence="7">Kramer / SPECITER OF COMMUNISM 613 Or so it appears. As Cohen points out, his argument "has weaknesses, which are noted. . . . The resulting defence of the development thesis is not con- clusive."27 Two weaknesses, which Cohen has not espied, deserve brief attention. First, it is not clear that Cohen can justifiably speak of "progress" or "development" in the flow of history. His defense of Marxism is not tied to any principle of unchangingly manifested wants; he emphasizes, indeed, that "what people need or want is not constant in history.... [I]t is a Marxian insistence, and a sound one, that needs expand in history, and undergo changes of character."28 But as soon as the expression of basic needs is relativized, we cannot confidently rank periods according to their greater or lesser productivity, because comparing the productivity of one age with that of a much earlier or later time requires a steady background -of particular needs -against which products take on the character of "goods." When the backgrounds become too disparate, the productive outputs will become largely incommensurable. Even if one knows that society A can produce greater quantities of most objects and services than society B, one cannot with certitude know where the productive forces are more advanced. For the latter determination, we must make an additional assessment that would enable us to pin down, in each society, those things and actions that can rightly be deemed productive. Any such assessment would base its findings on the needs that characterize each one of the social systems. If the societal sets of needs do not extensively overlap, and if the differences in the needs do not all occur within lines of output where society A enjoys the upper hand, we shall be disqualified from making a neat quantitative judgment of eco- nomic superiority, for we must then take into account the space within which goods (and thus productivity) are defined. To be sure, as Cohen declares in his response to a partly similar criticism,29 the present point will most likely not attain much practical import. Nonetheless, a more thoroughgoing and more sophisticated variant of this problem - which will be explored in Part II-could have grave consequences, not least of which is a challenge to the dichotomy between practical and conceptual importance. Chief among the remaining weaknesses of the argument that Cohen propounds is its attempted divorce of blindness from insight. In Cohen's schema, the validity of self-knowledge (and the efficacy of actions based on such knowledge) will have to be regarded as something that we can presup- pose generally. However problematic this view may be in the case of an individual agent, it becomes even more clearly so when we consider collec- tive actions. Even within the analytic philosopher's unpacked view of sub- jectivity, "there seems no reason to expect 'invisible hands' to predominate</page><page sequence="8">614 POLTICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 over 'prisoner's dilemmas' or other structural arrangements that generate undesirable. outcomes from individually rational actions."30 Aside from the problems of collective action, one always must take into account the ardent resistances of entrenched groups. As Jon Elster maintains, "the general interests of society do not create their own fulfillment."31 Cohen does recognize the problem of unintended consequences - al- though he remains complacent about dislodging entrenched groups32 - and he admits that a straightforward response would ultimately lead him to beg the question when he argues for the Primacy Thesis. As a result, he opts for a rather curious indirect reply by postulating that very few societies replace good productive forces with forces of inferior quality.33 Regression occurs only in extreme cases of hardship, such as natural disasters, whereas progress has occurred much more frequently. This, says Cohen, should induce us to re-evaluate the significance of his "three facts," which had been placed in some doubt by the admitted "shadow between what reason suggests and what society does."34 (Quite appropriate is his choice of metaphors; the shadow represents the inevitable elusiveness of that which subjectivity tries to master.) Cohen posits that if we accept his three facts as weighty, we shall have "a superior account of the marked lack of regression in productive power we have just been emphasizing." Cohen concludes from this that his three facts "have more weight than we came to fear."35 Hence, his proposal of the Development Thesis has in large part been vindicated. If we may have recourse to a standard criterion of analytic parlance - the criterion of validity - we may pronounce Cohen's argument invalid. The crucial step in his latest strategy is the following conditional premise: If the "three facts" are granted weight, they will amount to a better explanation of productive development than an explanation that focuses on people's inertia. When one infers from this premise that we again have good grounds for trusting in the veracity of Cohen's three facts, the inference will have opened the door to every explanation that one might care to suggest. Consider, for example, a theory that an omnipotent evil genius controls our minds and impels us to enhance our productive power incessantly. If this hypothesis is deemed weighty, then we no doubt shall have arrived at a truly powerful explanation of the progress that Cohen sees. But most people would none- theless shrink from looking upon the evil-genius supposition as weighty. In other words, the credibility of the antecedent in a conditional premise of the aforesaid type - "if X is true, then Y can readily be explained by X" -cannot ever be deduced from (or even slightly affected by) the status of the condi- tional as a whole. So long as the consequent is true, the truth of the antecedent cannot have any bearing upon the truth of the whole claim. Cohen cannot</page><page sequence="9">Kramer / SPECIER OF COMMUNISM 615 avoid addressing the query posed by one of his more astute critics: Are invisible hands more common and more important than prisoners' dilem- mas?36 The credibility of Cohen's three facts - which will turn, in large part, on one's response to that query -must be established on its own merits, for it can scarcely be derived from a conditional claim whose truth does not depend on the truth of any of the three facts. 2. The Primacy Thesis. Cohen employs two major starting points to ground his Primacy Thesis. In addition to the Development Thesis, which "provides the needed supplementation" to his other starting point, he takes as his main premise the view that "a given level of productive power is compatible only with a certain type, or certain types, of economic struc- ture."37 Enough has been said already about the "gaps" in the Development Thesis.38 Let us look at the other premise, which concerns what I previously referred to as the connection between stages of development and the opti- mality of particular economic structures. Cohen tries to resolve the difficul- ties which surround that connection, though he confines himself to a study of the capitalist economic structure; as he admits with disarming frankness,39 his approach has distinctly limited application to bygone eras. We shall not examine the details - or even the broad outlines - of Cohen's chapter on "The Productive Forces and Capitalism." Rather, four very brief remarks may serve to highlight the inconclusiveness of Cohen's pronounce- ments. First, Cohen appears to be at odds with himself about the standard of argument that he would approve as sound for the type of explanation that he is offering. On the one hand, he concedes that "[n]o abstract proof will show that slavery and production for the expansion of exchange-value are opposed in tendency.... There would be no incompatibility between capitalism and docile slaves at work on advanced productive forces: Twentieth-century dystopian fantasies are internally consistent."' For the most part, Cohen adheres to the relaxed standard of argument implied in these sentences. His accounts of the unique tendency of capitalism to promote free labor and economic growth are clever, sweeping, highly conjectural, and (to some extent) self-doubting, in the manner of high-quality newspaper editorials.4" On the other hand, Cohen criticizes Max Weber for offering a surmisal about the conflicts between capital accumulation and slavery; the soundness of Weber's argument, according to Cohen, "depends on circumstances. But nothing so circumstantial can provide a reason of principle against a union of slavery and capital accumulation."42 Readers may be excused for wonder- ing where this animadversion leaves Cohen's own hypotheses. Second, Cohen's often persuasive reasons for finding an inconsistency between large-scale economic development and unfree labor are open to a</page><page sequence="10">616 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 huge counterexample, one to which Cohen - as a loyal Marxist - remains blind. From the late 1930s to the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union underwent often rapid growth in some lines of output with a regime of work that was much closer to slavery than to free contract (even if we acknowledge the brutal force that, in a manifest or a latent form, will suffuse and undergird every system of "free" contract).43 Not always does Marxism in practice square with Marxism in theory. Third, Cohen moves at times from attacking one position to attacking another, in a way that leaves him vanquishing straw men. For example, when trying to explain the coexistence of serfdom and the accumulation of capital within Eastern Europe at the end of the Middle Ages, Cohen declares that the reducing of Eastern peasants to serfdom "embarrasses thesis (h) [i.e., the thesis that 'if production is for the sake of accumulating capital, the producers are free labourers'] only if [the reduction of the peasants] was largely due to a heightened pursuit of exchange-value."' Here Cohen commits an ignoratio elenchi. What he has to discredit is not a causal claim -that serfdom was largely due to the heightened quest for exchange-value -but a more modest view that serfdom did not rule out an expanded level of capital accumulation. By trying to force his critics into defending causal theses, Cohen diverts attention from the issue at hand: whether accumulation of capital may consort with multiple forms of labor. One can assume, pace Cohen, that a multiplicity of such forms are indeed possible, without hoping to account for specific forms by reference to the accumulation itself. Fourth, Cohen makes assumptions about human behavior that are not easily reconciled with each other. To see this, we must first look at one of his thought experiments. While arguing that a system of free labor requires capital accumulation, he pictures a society in which landlords compensate proletarians not with money but with part of the product of their labor (e.g., rations of dairy products and meat) as well as with some sort of abode. In such a state of affairs, each laborer is in essence a horizontally mobile serf; each works for whichever landlord she pleases, yet each is paid not in cash but in kind, and nothing is produced for exchange. Cohen insists that these arrangements will not last very long: [T]he landlords will seek good workers at minimum sacrifice to the consumption of their households. A tendency to compete for workers will arise. The rations consist of meat and wheat, and, at the outset, all farms produce both, for there is, ex hypothesi, no trade between them. But farms with a "comparative advantage" in wheat and meat production respectively will be disposed to swap products, if only in order to offer an enhanced basket of rations, and thus tempt good labour away from other farms. With enough</page><page sequence="11">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 617 development of such trade, production with a view to expanding the stock of exchange- value would become the norm.45 This scenario sits uneasily with remarks made a dozen pages later. There, Cohen seeks to demonstrate that precapitalist economic structures will not promote development systematically in the same way that a capitalist struc- ture will. He contends that, in a precapitalist social form, "production will not be for the accumulation of value . . . , and the only point of wealth will be 'enjoyment.' The exploiter will want the producer's surplus for the sake of its use-value." He then declares that the precapitalist exploiter "will, accordingly, be content to extract a limited surplus only, since there is a ceiling to the amount of use-value he may sanely desire and feasibly dispose of."46 Insatiable desire is now viewed as exceptional and extravagant, whereas it amounted earlier to a natural drive that would always make itself felt. Despite Cohen's theory of an immutable human nature, one tends to gain the impression that in his work there are shifts in the basic features of human life -whenever his argument is served thereby. 3. Primacy and Mutual Influence. Among Cohen's great accomplish- ments, none of them is more brilliant than his laying to rest confusion over the combined Marxian theses that (1) the productive relations in a given society are explained, for the most part, by the level of its productive forces, and (2) productive relations exercise a vast influence on productive forces in everyday life. A tempting reaction to these claims is to judge them mutually exclusive and to disallow one of them (more often the first). Such is the tenor of remarks made by Sidney Hook that "social relations of production ... can- not . . . be regarded as the automatic reflection of technology. On the con- trary, the development of technology is itself often dependent upon the system of social relationships in which it is found."47 Cohen makes clear how oversimplified such a response is. He argues that the prime link between productive forces and the productive relations is a functional one; that is, relations crop up as a particular scheme because that scheme suits the further development of the forces. He explains: The proposition that the production relations condition the development of the productive forces is, it should now be clear, not only compatible with, but entailed by, what we assert as the most important way in which the forces determine the relations. The effect of the relations on the forces is emphasized in our reading of the primacy thesis. It is that effect which explains the nature of the relations, why they are as they are. The forces would not develop as they do were the relations different, but that is why the relations are not different -because relations of the given kind suit the development of the forces.48</page><page sequence="12">618 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 Cohen thus seemingly transfigures what had been viewed by some people as one of Marxism's great shortcomings into one of its great strengths. Far from sapping the primacy of the forces, the influence of relations will be a part, an integral part, of any such primacy. IL FUNCTIONALIST MARXISM DECONSTRUCTED We embark now on a much more venturesome scrutinizing of Cohen's Primacy Thesis; the aim here will be to explore the textuality of the version of Marxism that Cohen advocates. By highlighting the unruliness of Cohen's discoursive medium, this Part will throw into grave doubt the fundaments of his texts, where discourse is regarded as a mere "medium." Our analytical method may here properly be called "deconstructive" -so long as we keep in mind that "properness" is one of the chief targets of deconstruction (even if, like the Hydra, "properness" regains strength through the very process of being challenged).49 In the first section, we shall have revealed a number of striking ways in which the discoursive texture of Cohen's work has thrust itself to the fore, sometimes in harmony with his intentions, sometimes strangely contrary thereto. A careful study of Cohen's language will set the mood for a general deconstruction of Marxist theory, at least as that theory is understood by Cohen. In the deconstructive critique set forth in the latter section, Cohen's Marxism will be overturned and displaced and reinscribed into a vertiginous oscillation between pragmatism (or a view of knowledge as a matter of highly variable conventions) and philosophical realism (or a view of knowledge as the sensing and understanding of brute facts in the pre-existent natural and social worlds). Neither pole of this oscillation can triumph, for -as in any true paradox -each will have dismantled itself and will have become the other by virtue of e-xcluding and disavowing it. Before we begin, however, three potential points of confusion should be cleared up, or at least warned against. First, language assumes a starring role throughout this critique of Cohen, but the intended meaning of "language" will not hold constant; it sometimes has a restricted and conventional scope, but has at other times an unconventional, broader scope. Within its broader ambit, "language" refers to every system of categorization by which acts and phenomena are invested with their identities. This expansive usage will comprise structures that are usually regarded as nonlinguistic - such as relations of production -as well as classificatory systems that are deemed "languages" in everyday parlance. It is mainly in the second half of this Part</page><page sequence="13">Kramer / SPECITER OF COMMUNISM 619 that the broad usage will have come into play. At any rate, one should generally have few problems in knowing where to distinguish the restricted meaning from the expansive meaning. Where statements would otherwise lie too far open to unproductive misreadings, the wide purview of "language" has been signaled prominently. A second possible source of and misinterpretations is the contingency and tenuousness of links between the two main sections that follow. The first section ("Reality as Metaphor") is not presupposed by the latter section ("From Pragmatism to Deconstruction"); one can reject the arguments of the former while accepting the argument of the latter. Nevertheless, the former section will have helped to create a mood appropriate for one's reading the latter section. By observing that, malgre lui, Cohen intermittently underlines the importance of language in its narrow sense, the initial section will have begun to show that texts must always be already caught in linguistic forces that exceed them and overwhelm them. Having argued that Cohen's works quite frequently highlight the determining role of language, and having at least implied that ainsi they cut against their own principles of economic determinism, the first section below will have hence started to strip those principles of an air of reassuring self-mastery. In such a way, my analysis arguing that language conventionally understood has now and then been prioritized will fruitfully set the stage for my analysis showing that language broadly understood has been systematically (and unwittingly) privileged. But it is only in creating an atmosphere of hermeneutic suspicion that the former analysis connects with the latter one. Nothing in the survey of Cohen's neopragmatist leanings will indispensably or directly shore up what follows it: namely, the wholesale toppling and displacement of his materialism. A third point that should be emphasized here is the uncanniness of the deconstructive critique in the latter half of this Part. Because that critique will highlight the self-subverting power of Cohen's Marxism, a defender of Cohen or of Marx will perhaps assume that deconstruction takes life from an idealist philosophy. Such a reading, like the equating of deconstruction with skepticism, stems from a desire to quash the truly vertiginous and discom- forting movement of a deconstructive interrogation. Neither pragmatism nor any other mode of idealism, deconstructive philosophy will have compre- hended idealism and materialism, and will always have already undone and reinscribed those positions. To be sure, this second Part will have highlighted the idealist grounding of materialism, and will not have commensurately highlighted the materialist grounding of idealism; but that is a matter of strategic focus for an encounter with Marxist theory. Although this Part will have launched a challenge to materialism, one could just as cogently marshal</page><page sequence="14">620 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 deconstructive techniques for a full-scale challenge to idealism. As was noted above, neither pole of an antinomical pendulation can ultimately emerge triumphant, for each will have always lost by virtue of having always won. A. Reality as Metaphor 1. Cohen's Apparent Pragmatism. Cohen's texts highlight the supreme importance of language in providing structure to that which we call "reality." They do this in a variety of ways, not least in some quite explicit statements. For example, near the end of his introductory chapter on the "images of history" in Hegelianism and Marxism, Cohen writes that "the entire national community sustains the independence at work in economic life but comple- ments it by providing collective identity and culture, without which an economy is impossible, for at the very least a common language is required in which contractual agreements are expressed."'' To be sure, this sentence is by no means univocally supportive of the interpretation advanced here; it can readily be construed as cutting against a pragmatist position. Cohen does, after all, seem to be implying that we need language only for the "expression" of economic activities, which presumably take place in a manner sharply divergent from the manner in which discourse unfolds. More strikingly tied to pragmatist assumptions is Cohen's stand on the nature of explanatory accounts. Noting, in a slightly different discussion, that "the only symbols and thought-forms available are those which come from the past,"5" Cohen proceeds to offer some pragmatist remarks on the "symbols" and the "thought-forms" that necessarily structure explanations: All phenomena may be described more or less specifically, and an explanation of a phenomenon succeeds or fails relative to some finitely specific description of it, not irrespective of how it is described.... All explanation operates against a background of theoretical presupposition to which candidate explanations which satisfy structural and confirmational criteria must con- form.52 These remarks fit in well with Cohen's proclivity to characterize explain- ing as story-telling; in his principal accounts of functional explanation, Cohen refers in at least three places to the need for heuristic "stories" whenever someone propounds a functionalist view.53 (Stories, bien su'r, are the most widely conceded - although not otherwise unique - case of words read within conventions.54) Cohen's remarks on the importance of descrip- tions and intellectual backgrounds will fit in also with his chief method of</page><page sequence="15">Kramer / SPECWR OF COMMUNISM 621 formulating a Marxist theory of history. At every stage of his theorizing, Cohen introduces his key dyads by reference to descriptions of socioeco- nomic activities and forms, rather than by reference to the activities and forms themselves. Of the many examples that could be given, only a few need be adduced here. In one of his early essays, Cohen defines "social role" as follows: "A description under which a person falls allocates him to a social role or position in the measure that the attribution to him of some rights and/or duties is inseparable from the application of the description."55 A like ap- proach can be found throughout Karl Marx 's Theory of History. For instance, when addressing the problem of base/superstructure entanglements, Cohen states that his first move is "to formulate a non-legal interpretation of the legal terms in Marx's characterizations of production relations." As he observes, his definition of the nonjuridical powers that are matched with rights is "purely syntactical," in that "we ... transform any phrase of the form 'the right to 4' into a phrase which denotes a power by dropping the word 'right' and replacing it by the word 'power.' "56 A similar focus on descriptions is to be found, even more significantly, when Cohen draws his distinction between social and material aspects of human life: "How may we demarcate the material from the social situation? Let us try this criterion: a description is social if and only if it entails an ascription to persons - specified or unspecified - of rights or powers vis-a- vis other men."57 What this suggests is that the split between sociality and materiality does not antecede discourse, but instead emanates from it (i.e., from germane contrasts between opposing types of descriptions). Cohen's reliance on descriptions may serve to emphasize that we are enabled and entrapped by language; if Cohen appears fixated on discourse to the exclu- sion of "real life," that is perhaps because real life always is already de- ferred.58 Cohen's methodology and his express statements align his version of Marxism with Nelson Goodman's pragmatist insight that approaching the world without some controvertible frame of reference is totally inconceiv- able.59 Under this view, what we classify as "real life" becomes such only by being under description. One cannot ever attain to a realm of pure facticity uncontaminated by language and free from all particular points of view. Utterly problematic, then, is the line between description and explanation, or interpretations and theories. All this can plausibly be inferred from some of Cohen's explicit claims and central procedures. Nonetheless, before we go too far toward portraying Cohen as a self-conscious adherent to the pragmatist cause, we should acknowledge powerful countervailing strains in his work. Like most other analytic philosophers, Cohen harbors a strong tendency to privilege signified</page><page sequence="16">622 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 meanings over signifying linguistic elements. As Richard Rorty has com- mented, most philosophers think that "[w]riting is an unfortunate necessity; what is really wanted is to show, to demonstrate, to point out, to exhibit, to make one's interlocutor stand at gaze before the world."60 Perhaps the most frequent channel for Cohen's tendency to depreciate signifiers is his rephras- ing of Marx's principles and conclusions in the hope of "clarifying" their sense. Thus, for example, he proposes to "criticize [Marx's] formulations [of the social/material dichotomy] in order to clarify his idea." A comparable move occurs when Cohen elects to scrutinize some statements from Marx's "Preface" to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Those statements are recast and brought "into terminological conformity with one another.... [flor subsequent ease of handling." Cohen advises that "we allow ourselves a little syntactical leeway." Likewise, when looking at one of Marx's dicta on the essential harmony between capital accumulation and free labor, Cohen maintains that "[t]he sentence is syntactically complex, and what it says is easier to survey in [a] semantically equivalent rewrite."61 Yet again, that is, Cohen repeats one of the classic gestures of Occidental philosophy, as described by Barbara Johnson: Presiding over classical notions of philosophy and translation are thus the separability of style and thought and the priority of the signified over the signifier, whose only legitimate role is to create order and sequence. Faithfulness to the text has meant faithfulness to the semantic tenor with as little interference as possible from the constraints of the vehicle. Translation, in other words, has always been the translation of meaning.62 2. Cohen's Unwitting Pragmatism. Cohen's contempt toward signifiers ought to discourage anyone from too neatly assimilating his views to the views of writers in the neopragmatist camp. At the level of his explicit claims - the level of what is said, as determined by our hermeneutic assump- tions, which remain to be analyzed - Cohen's texts waver between pragma- tism and realism. To educe from his work a pragmatist position, we shall have to proceed more subtly. We must look beyond that which his texts say, to ferret out also some of the ways they work; very much at odds with Cohen's intentions, his writings highlight their own status as writing. We shall now look at two devices, metaphoricity and abstraction, through which this highlighting comes about. (a) The Perils ofAbstraction. Abstraction and generality were, as is well known, the categories employed by Marx to analyze the peculiar economic structure imposed by capitalism on the material processes of production. The accumulating of capital, and the processes of exchange that are both its cause</page><page sequence="17">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 623 and its effect, can take place only if concrete goods have been made commensurable through abstraction. Participants in a capitalist economy must be able to exchange each good for varying quantities of other goods, and the substitution of one good for another good demands commensurabil- ity. Commensurability, by definition, entails some abstract standard that will allow products to be measured against each other.63 This standard, which Marx titled "exchange-value," involves abstraction from all the concrete characteristics of individual goods and from all particular forms of labor used to produce those goods. "Exchange, in other words, knows only impropriety in figuring the physical as the metaphysical, the concrete as the abstract; blindly enabling commodities to 'take one another's place,' exchange thus proceeds in total ignorance of 'the specific character of the needs [these commodities] satisfy as use-values."'" In a capitalist economy, "abstraction is made from every concrete form and useful property of actual work," and each "particularized concrete kind of labour has to pass for abstract human labour."65 Now, our aim will be not so much to assail Marx's approach as to trace its functioning in Cohen's theory. Specifically, what merits attention here is Cohen's subsuming of the use-value/exchange-value relationship under the materiality/sociality distinction. Like Marx, who held that "exchange-value is produced by . . . abstract universal labour, and this belongs to a social framework,"66 Cohen sees the abstraction that forms exchange-value as contingent rather than elemental, as socially determined rather than ineluc- table. Use-value is concrete and material, whereas exchange-value is abstract and social. Abstraction is a social phenomenon through and through. Labour productive of use-value is concrete, or qualitatively differentiated: it is tailoring, weaving, mining, etc. Labour productive of exchange-value is abstract, just a featureless proportion of the total labour of society. The sum total of use-values is the concrete or material wealth of society, whereas the ensemble of exchange-values - the same totality socially viewed - is its abstract or social wealth.67 Now, once again, our aim is not to dislodge the mode of analysis just outlined. Arguendo, we shall agree with Cohen that abstract value "is a 'purely social' and hence 'non-natural' property of the product."' We will agree, in short, that the abstraction intrinsic to exchange-value plays a role like the one played by discoursive structures as understood within neopragmatism. Each discoursive structure (in any field) is a historically fashioned set of conventions through which problems are formulated and tackled. Just so is capitalist abstraction, which frames economic dealings in " 'purely social' and hence 'non-natural"' terms. Like any discoursive net-</page><page sequence="18">624 POLMCAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 works, the languages of abstraction -"languages" being used in a broad sense here - pose and develop problems that, ipsofacto, are socially defined. What makes this noteworthy is that abstraction plays yet another part in Cohen's version of Marxism. Not only is it one of the objects of his analysis, but also it is a structuring principle as well. Time and again, Cohen informs us that abstraction is necessary for an illuminating critique of capitalist life. In the last chapter of his book, for example, he proclaims: "The capitalist essence is at issue here, not the accidents of geography and history.... [T]he consequences of principles animating the society are explored in abstracto, but the results bear on reality, since the animating principles are really there."69 Even more revealing are caveats he offers when peddling his distinction between sociality and materiality. This distinction, which - as we have observed -includes the abstract/concrete distinction, does not occupy a commanding perch outside the array of contrasts that it delimits. Quite the contrary; if the social/material diremption is to exist, a feat of abstracting must have occurred already. [W]e may always abstract from the social form and display the current state of the relation between man and nature, and the material relations between men underlying their social relations.... The relationship between man and nature is "mediated" by the social form: it does not occur outside it. The development of nature, described in socio-neutral terms, is therefore an abstraction. But it is a theoretically important abstraction.... Production in its asocial aspect is "material production," this being the content of capitalist or any other form of production. And that content may be described in illuminating abstraction from the form with which it is integrated.... Material production does not occur in history except enveloped in a social form, for "non-social man," if he ever existed, disappeared when history began. Hence the purely material process is an "abstract conception which does not define any of the actual historical stages of production."70 Cohen's foremost dyad is thus an outcome of processes that have been described as generative of"'purely social' and hence 'non-natural' " quali- ties. Just as capitalists tend to disregard the specific content of every good to focus exclusively on exchange-value, so Cohen strips away the specificform of each economic system to focus solely on the productive agencies. In each case, an operation is carried out that imposes an artificial arrangement on the rich details of reality, and in each case an arrangement has come to be what it is through the analytical device of abstraction. Yet abstraction is not only the means whereby materiality is discerned, but is itself the capitalist version of sociality (which, as Cohen notes, is the lone version to which he and Marx</page><page sequence="19">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 625 devote much analysis71). This suggests that "materiality" is always already social, in the sense that it can come into view only as a result of the procedure (that is, abstraction) which resides at the social end of the sociality/materiality split. Cohen's texts thus establish the inescapable sway of language -in a broad sense -by acting out the social delimitation and definition of material life. That Cohen's work upholds the contentions of neopragmatists may al- ready appear unsettling, quite apart from any critique of pragmatism that one might offer. After all, Cohen can enjoy no longer the steady and clear-cut oppositions (between, say, "physical necessities" and "social arrange- ments"72) that his theory needs. Nonetheless, the most severe difficulties have yet to be drawn out; this is but the beginning of the sufferings. Before we turn to those deeper problems, let us explore one additional respect in which Cohen's writings support pragmatism. (b) Metaphor in the Text of Marxism. Early in his chief text, Cohen acknowledges that he makes "free use of ... spatial metaphor" in setting up his tripartite analytical framework of the productive forces, the production relations, and the superstructure.73 Hardly is this a cause for astonishment, because the metaphoricity of Marxist explanations has long been recog- nized - not least by those who are sharply hostile to the specific metaphors chosen (and who articulate their hostility through more sobering metaphors): "It [i.e., the base/superstructure distinction] is. . . a dead, static, architectural metaphor, whose potential for illumination was never very great and which has for too long cast nothing but shadows over Marxist theory and Marxist practice."7'4 However that may be, Cohen certainly does indulge in the classic Marxist metaphors quite profusely. His rhetorical skills, however, are not invariably self-conscious and self-controlled, and indeed they sometimes patently clash with the intentions that he expresses. Some of Cohen's favorite metaphors cluster around the themes of illumi- nation and visibility. Insouciantly disregardful of the strong challenges to these notions that have increasingly been mounted in recent decades,75 Cohen avers that in a society with club law, powers remain "openly visible," whereas in a more advanced legal system, "rights screen powers."76 Broadly similar tropes appear when capitalism is contrasted with socialism: "Capitalism is obscure. Only science can illuminate it. But in the bright light of socialism the torch of the specialized investigator is invisible."77 In the above examples, Cohen's ocular metaphors may seem stimulating and harmless, but at other times his rhetorical strategies become much more dubious. For instance, Cohen takes it upon himself to define the general meaning of "explanation." This he does as follows: "Probably to explain is,</page><page sequence="20">626 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 quite simply, to make clear."78 Here, if anywhere, one might have expected Cohen to strive for literality, as the difference that he perceives between interpretation and theorizing lies exactly in the presumed power of theoretical discourse to explain (rather than just to tel).79 What he has done, however, is to resort to one of the most tried figures of speech in Western metaphysics, made perhaps most famous in Descartes's "clear and distinct" ideas - which were guaranteed by the "natural light" -but going back much further, as one can see in Jacques Derrida's interrogation of Aristotle's metaphorology: "The appeal [by Aristotle] to the criteria of clarity and obscurity would suffice to confirm what we stated above: This entire philosophical delimitation of metaphor already lends itself to being constructed and worked by 'meta- phors.' How could a piece of knowledge or a language be properly clear or obscure?"80 Cohen's account of explanation thus takes its place in a long history of quests for "the assured legibility of the proper.""8 Far from standing outside metaphoricity, explanations of explanation emerge from what they try to exclude. More troublesome still for Cohen are two passages where his jaundiced outlook on metaphor becomes explicit, with a reliance on tropes. The first such occasion figures in his account of legal systems. After vividly describing the superstructure-and-base as a roof resting on four struts, Cohen tries to depict the same configuration "non-metaphorically: the property relations are as they are because their being so is conducive to the initiation or maintenance of the production relations (demanded by the productive forces)."82 Two comments seem appropriate here. First, anyone who has read Nietzsche (or even Hume) should be less willing to regard causal language as a transparent window on brute reality.83 One need not concur blindly with the subjectivist tone of Nietzsche's ridiculing of causal discourse, to under- stand - as indeed Cohen sometimes does - that causal links take place only in stories.84 Second, and more important, the statement that production relations are "demanded" by the productive forces is an anthropomorphic trope par excellence. Productive forces are cast as an imperious sovereign that "demands" fulfillment of its main needs by the ever dutiful production relations85; it is the forces that amount to the chief actor in history, as Cohen makes clear in the first chapter of his book: The growth of human power is the central process of history. The need for that growth explains why there is history.... Marx's conception of history preserves the structure of Hegel's but endows it with fresh content. For Hegel, as we have seen, history shows an expansion of consciousness giving itself form in cultures, which subvert themselves through their success in advancing consciousness.... For Marx, as we shall see in the rest of this book, the important forms</page><page sequence="21">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 627 are not cultures but economic structures, and the role of consciousness is assumed by expanding productive power.86 Unfortunately, Cohen seems later to forget that his first chapter is titled "Images of History in Hegel and Marx." Those "images" haunt Cohen's attempts at literality, like a specter that stalks Europe. Another time when Cohen displays his marked aversion toward meta- phors, as well as his inability to escape them, is to be found in the first of the appendices to his book. There he dwells upon a distinction between essences and appearances. He discusses phenomena (such as the geocentric universe and the unitary composition of air) which prima facie appear true but which turn out to be false when they are more carefully examined. He writes: The appearances just reviewed are, like mirages, part of the world around us. They comprise the outer form of things, which enjoys an objective status, and which science alone can strip away. To express the thought with less imagery, let us say that there is a gulf between appearance and reality when and only when the explanation of a state of affairs falsifies the description it is natural to give of it if one lacks the explanation. Gulfs are due to the way reality itself appears, and only when they exist is science required for a state of affairs to be intelligible.87 Suffice it to say that there exists a wide gulf between the underscored sentence and the promised diminution of (spatial) imagery. As Barbara Johnson has noted, spatial figures of speech tend only to engulf those who try to dispense with them: "[S]ome measure of the difficulties involved [in 'attempts to break out of spatial logic'] may be derived from the fact that to break out of is still a spatial metaphor."88 (One need scarcely add here that "explanation" -whose referent Cohen distinguishes from description in the above passage - is derived from "explanare, " which means "to spread out.") Nor is Cohen on any firmer ground with his reference to "the description it is natural to give." Here he trades on one of the most unstable metaphors in the whole Western tradition. Because, as Cohen tells us, "nature is of course a product of history, changing within and as a result of social forms," and because "nature, described in socio-neutral terms is therefore an abstrac- tion," his use of the word "natural" as applied to certain descriptions must be seen as a metaphorical evocation of some pristine state (with an Adamic language outside social conditioning) that could never exist.89 In the Book of Numbers, the diviner Balaam is called upon by Balak to curse the people of Israel. Each time Balaam opens his mouth, however, he can but laud those whom he has been asked to execrate. Cohen's struggle against pragmatism seems as ill-fated as Balak's wicked request. Each time</page><page sequence="22">628 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 Cohen seeks to discount language, he can but prove that in the beginning was the word. B. From Pragmatism to Deconstruction Having traced the outlines of a pragmatist stance in Cohen's theory (both in its substance and in its structure), and having consequently oflered a glimpse of the uneasy role of languages in that theory, we now shall find that language does not submit to being accommodated and mastered. Rather, what at present may seem to be a slight annoyance will soon tum out to be a fundamental disruption that will overturn the values inscribed in Cohen's Marxism. His system divides against itself along lines whose general shape - although not their specific course -could have readily been foretold. We shall not be lifted, however, to a secure vantage from which we "rectify" Cohen's faults. His missteps are irremediable, and we shall therefore be implicated in everything we denounce. Deconstruction leads not to a sublime posture of unequivocal triumph, but to an unstoppable pendulation between standpoints both incoherent and necessary. Let us call to mind Cohen's theory that the development of the productive forces will have accounted for the development of the economic structures that enfold a given society. According to his Primacy Thesis, the relationships of production assume whatever contours are most appropriate for advancing the further evolution of the productive forces. This will imply, as we have noted, that the relations of production affect the paths of development of productive forces; precisely because relations can affect that development, a specific array of forces will cause a certain set of relations to win out. The great virtue of this line of analysis - from Cohen's point of view - is that it anticipates and defuses the most salient objections to its own claims. Every time a critic points out what seems a devastating example of the enormous influence exercised by the production relations on the productive forces, Cohen can make a much more devastating riposte: Not only does the enormous impact not belie the Primacy Thesis, but it actually helps to strengthen that Thesis, for it helps to explain why given productive forces opt for a particular network of relations. Relations get singled out precisely owing to their stimulative capacity, their capacity to enhance the growth of productive power. In his brilliantly ingenious argument, Cohen has had to take many things for granted. Most notably, he has had to presuppose that the meaning of "productivity" can be fixed without any danger to the substance of his analysis. If we look back to his early definitions, we find remarkably little</page><page sequence="23">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 629 guidance. However meticulous and subtle those definitions may be, they prove less than helpful in the matter at hand - that is, in attempting to delimit "production." We are told, for example, that the productive forces are used "by producing agents to make products."90 Happily, we fare somewhat better when we move to the definitional appendix in Cohen's book. There Cohen informs us that the term "use-value" applies to things with "power to satisfy, directly or indirectly, a human desire," and he also remarks that use-value is a necessary condition of exchange-value.91 Now, because he elsewhere divides all forms of production into production purely for use-value and production for exchange-value,92 we may infer that all production - properly so called - aims at the creation of goods and services that can "satisfy, directly or indirectly, a human desire." Production, then, involves the output of desirable things. Cohen has succeeded in specifying, albeit vaguely, his presupposed definition of what counts as "productive." By so doing, however, he has provided us the wedge needed for overtuming his whole analysis. In a passage quoted earlier, Cohen recognizes the vital role of discourse in the conducting of economic life, and throughout the last section we observed the pragmatist moments of his philosophy - moments that lay stress on the importance of languages in giving shape to conceptions of what is real. It now becomes clear that language, understood both broadly and narrowly, is not just a crucial factor in socioeconomic life, but is the antecedent condition of its possibility. Only through the categorizing power of the languages that make up social life can there ever emerge a demarcation between what is desirable and what is undesirable in a given culture. Without the categories and systematic distinc- tions that form the stuff of some or another language, no activity like production ever could have come into being, for no difference could be obtained between "productivity" and "counterproductivity." Only language provides the space within which goods and productive forces are classed as such. Without categorizing schemes, production would be reduced to non- sense -to non-sense in the strictest sense of the term. Production acquires sense (and therefore its status as production) only through the classificatory arrangements that mark off undesirability from desirability. Aversions and preferences define what counts as productive, and they are defined in turn by socially current schemes of differentiation. Cohen cannot respond successfully to the argument just made by asserting that "undesirableness" and "desirableness" enjoy universal applicability, as concepts that will have to appear in all conceivable forms of life. Such a response, although scarcely disputable, would nevertheless be unavailing because, as Cohen notes elsewhere, "the universal can exist only in a</page><page sequence="24">630 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 determinate embodiment: there is no way of being human which is not a way of being human."93 That each social system will distinguish desirability from undesirability does not mean that the demarcational line will take exactly the same shape (or even roughly the same shape) everywhere. As Cohen tells us: "It is false that all human beings desire the same things, or that, when they do, they want the same services from them."94 Particular medleys of discrim- inative judgments will antecede the "productiveness" of productive forces, for those judgments delimit what is to be deemed "good" and hence what is to be deemed "productive." Nor can Cohen fall back on the remarkably clever argument that he has hitherto used. It is no good for him to retort as follows: "A particular kind of discourse has come along precisely as a result of its stimulating impact on the productive forces." Such a reply will necessarily run aground, for discourse - that is, categorizing networks - cannot take shape (at least as a whole) in service of the demands of productive power, because it is discourse that allots boundaries to what is acceptable or desirable and hence to what is or is not productive. Productive power gains its identity as such only through the categorizing reach of language. Outside that reach, the concept of "productivity" loses any meaning; there thus cannot be any productive forces until languages have already given shape to the productivity/disutility dis- tinction. Languages thus take form as analytically prior, and not just chrono- logically antecedent, to the developing of productive agencies.95 The set of possible courses of such developing is marked out by the classificatory frameworks that have defined "productivity." Those courses can never predecide any overall constellation of such frameworks, for the pathways become defined as such only after the frameworks are in place. To retain primacy, the forces will have had to emerge as a conceivable option before they can emerge as a conceivable option. To see how far Cohen's theory has broken down, we may take our cue from a critique of his junrsprudence that I have advanced elsewhere.96 There it is argued that the structures of legal language gain definition, if they can indeed do so at all, only by application to the specifics of "real life" (which in turn can bestow meaning only within structures that have always already gained definition). What that suggests (or assumes) is that juristic relations as reticulated in "real life" can usefully be treated as constituting a language. Such relationships will hence function and misfunction like any other lan- guage, for, like all other languages, they elaborate themselves through structure-event antinomies. We should expect, therefore, that the distribution of wealth will antecede the productivity of productive forces as much as will the classificatory</page><page sequence="25">Kramer / SPECTER OF COMMUNISM 631 structures that are more typically regarded as languages. Distribution's priority will be structural or logical in addition to being temporal. That is, legal relations, even when conventionally rather than expansively under- stood,97 should play an important role in defining "goods" and thus in defining "productivity." Our expectations are indeed realized when we look at the work of scholars who have explored this issue. Duncan Kennedy, for example, has observed that " [i]t is a commonplace that there will be different allocations of resources in the same economy according to how income is distributed," and he details (with admirable sophistication) the many ways in which this "commonplace" holds.98 It need only be added here that a distribution of wealth affects not simply the allocation of resources but also their very definition. Along with the other languages in which human beings come to describe themselves, the law provides categories and applications that shape the meaning of "desir- ableness" and "undesirableness." In addition to forming one's ability to indulge preferences, any distribution of wealth or income will have a hand in shaping the preferences themselves through and through. This it will have, because "preferences evolve with the consumption pattern one chooses,"99 and because a "consumption pattern" will be determined importantly by distributional outcomes. Thus, in combination with many other important languages, the legal "language" will have determined the cast and will have composed the script for the performance and indeed the very emerging of the productive forces; language can never be reduced to a handservant or puppet, for the alleged puppet-master could then never exist. The letter gives life and makes the spirit (of productivity) possible. III. CONCLUSION Thanks to Cohen's pragmatist inclinations, we were alerted to the supreme importance of language in his analyses. This led us to highlight the disruptive effects of language when it has been seemingly relegated to a subordinate position. Language can never be contained within the analytical hierarchies that Cohen sets up. We have thus upended the systematic priorities in which Cohen's Marxism consists; the base and the superstructure have taken precedence vis-a-vis the productive forces, which had been viewed thus far as causally antecedent. Language holds sway indeed as a mighty specter that torments Communism. To be sure, this reversal will enjoy no greater stability than the theoretical framework that it puts into question. A suitable analysis could make clear</page><page sequence="26">632 POLITICAL THEORY / NOVEMBER 1989 that this reversal depends on the anterior status and development of produc- tive forces. And the new overturning of the new priorities would itself have supplied the grounds for its own undoing, ad infinitum. As has been noted, deconstruction can never halt its own impetus; every critique always already undermines itself. But none of this affords Cohen any comfort. Certain is it that deconstructive critiques "inhabit philosophical opposition, resisting and disorganizing it, without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution.""'0 Just as certain, however, is that Cohen's standpoint is comprehended and situated by deconstruction. His Marxism will dislocate itself in paradoxical overturnings that both demand and forbid the constitu- tion of a "third term." NOTES 1. G. A.

Equally condescending is the assertion that Marx "outgrew" Hegel. See KMTH, 22. 6. Cohen, "Reconsidering Historical Materialism," p. 232. For Cohen's examples involv- ing women, see KMTH, 90, 93, 182. 7. For treatment of these questions, see, e.g., Adamson, "Review Essay" (arguing that Cohen has given only one possible interpretation of Marx and has ignored other possible readings); Jon Elster, Making Sense of Marx (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), 269-272; Miller, "Productive Forces and the Forces of Change." 8. See, e.g., Cohen, "Book Review," 266-271; Elster, "Cohen on Marx's Theory of History," 124 (observing that "the productive forces were largely static up to recent times"); Donald Hodges &amp; Ross Gandy, "Varieties of Economic Determinism," Journal of Economic History (June 1980), 373-376, 374 ("In modem Western Europe we have, for the first time, an economically advancing society"). 9.

Subsequently, he states that "man is a mammal, with a definite biological constitution, which evolves hardly at all in some respects" (KMTH, 151). But he is thus writing about general need rather than the specific instantiations thereof-i.e., about "[h]uman need, whatever may be its historically various content" (KMTH, 152). 29.

For an attack on necessitarian views such as those held by Cohen, see Max Weber, Economy and Society, trans. by Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978), Vol. 2,1090-1092. Unsurprisingly, Weber's critical thrusts retain quite a strong belief in necessitarianism. For another viewpoint opposed to Cohen's, see Gordon, "Critical Legal Histories." In the course of attacking functionalism in several ways, Gordon writes of "the myriad paths to capital accumulation" that "should at least make the functionalist hesitate" (p. 78). For critiques of the (il)logic of supplementarity, see Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans. by Gayatri Spivak (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976), 141-164; Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference, trans. by Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), 289-290. 38.

Compare the view of a leading pragmatist: "To accept the contingency of starting points is to accept our inheritance from, and our conversation with, our fellow humans as our only source of guidance."

For a good discussion, from a structuralist standpoint, of some of the codes that enter into the reading of literary texts, see Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1975), 131-160. If literature can in any way be deemed distinctive, then the distinctiveness "consists perhaps only in the fact that [nonliterary discourse] is more likely to be blind to the way in which its own critical difference from itself makes it, in the final analysis, literary."

This seems as good a place as any to reprimand Isaac Balbus for arguing that substitution demands equality, rather than mere commensurability, of goods. See Isaac Balbus, "Commodity Form and Legal Form: An Essay on the 'Relative Autonomy' of the Law," Law and Society Review (Winter 1977), 571-588. Balbus has not retracted this contention, despite his renunciation of Marxism. See Isaac Balbus, Marxism and Domination (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1982), 101-102.

That substitution has always already begun; that imitation, principle of art, has always already interrupted natural plenitude; that, having to be a discourse, it has always already [breached] presence in differance; that in Nature it is always that which supplies Nature's lack, a voice that is substituted for the voice of Nature. 90.
