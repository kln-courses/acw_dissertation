<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION, WUNAMBAL TRIBE, NORTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA By A. Lommel culture of the Australian Aborigines is undergoing rapid change. Contact with civilization destroys the original social structure and outlook on life. The original ideas on which their life is based may be found in their mythology, but practical everyday life shows almost everywhere the intrusions of the approaching civilization. So the s xual behaviour also may have been considerably changed by the new conditions of life which prevail on missions, stations and farms or their near surroundings. Many aspects of the sexual behaviour show signs of degeneration. Normally these aborigines wander in small groups from water-place to water- place in a certain area which cannot be left without the permission of the neighbouring group or tribe. During the day the men divide themselves in several hunting parties. The women collect edible roots and fruits. In the late afternoon all individuals meet again at the same or another water-place. There the food obtained during the day is prepared, cooked and eaten. At night the whole group is huddled together around one or several fires. Sexual intercourse never takes place at night in these camps but always at day time in the bush. I do not know if this always has been so, but I am told that also at the missions or stations where many aboriginals live permanently in a semi-civilized state, sexual intercourse mostly takes place in the day time in the near surroundings, and not in the shanties the people sleep in. An exception is the ceremonial occasions when several men and a few women gather in one hut at night. During their normal nomadic life men and women arrange every morning when eating the remnants from the meal of the evening before, with few words but mostly by signs, time and places of the rendezvous of the day. Women and girls listen intently to the casual remarks the hunters drop about their plans how and where they are going to round up kangaroos, and arrange their plans according to those of the men. Sexual intercourse starts at an early age, but is frowned upon by older people as it should begin only after initiation. On the stations and missions old people lose their influence on the younger and alert persons who are able to understand the new law which is brought by the white men. There exists a special expression for sexual intercourse between young boys and girls : jan jan (Unambal and Worora tribe). The old customs of initiation are also passing away and are being replaced by more modern and less severe ceremonies. The following is what I could find out about the traditional initiation in the Unambal tribe which lives north of the Ungarinyin tribe in the Kimberley division of north-western Australia.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION 159 The process of initiation of the young men was prolonged through several years and marked by some special events : circumcision, subincision and the cutting of marks on the body. The whole process was never confined to these operations but included a revelation of the secret beliefs and traditions of the tribe. The initiation of girls consisted only in the cutting of marks after the first menstruation and a rather clumsily executed defloration to make a girl " ready " for intercourse. After that, so it is said, a girl lived for some time until her marriage in promiscuity with all those men to whom she was according to her relationship an eligible wife. This custom still prevails, so I was told, in missions where it is officially prohibited and therefore practised secretly at night only. The initiation of the young men starts at an early age when circumcision is performed. Formerly this important event was celebrated with a ceremonial round-dance. To-day it is more often than not omitted altogether - as in sub- incision - and is replaced by one of the new cults which are spreading among the aborigines of this region and absorbing many features of the old tradition. Of my informants only the older men were circumcised, the younger were not. None of them could tell me any myth referring to the custom of circumcision. The importance of subincision often lies not so much in the one performance but in its frequent repetition which is executed again and again at secret ceremonies and serves to procure blood for ritual acts. The first performance takes place when the young man shows the first signs of a growing beard. It is executed by a man whose relation to the initiand is in the terms of the tribal kinship system that of an elder brother. The young man is seated on a stone and his penis is split with a stone knife on its under side. During this performance the onlooking men recite in the form of a song the different names of all sorts of spearheads of stone as well as the names of all parts of which a spear consists and also the names of all tools which are needed to make a spear and a good spearhead. It was explained to me that this is done to teach the initiand how to make good spears and spearheads. Before he is subincised a young man is not allowed to make a complete spear, though he is expected to acquire the necessary skill to make one by frequently working out the different parts of which it consists. The penis, having been split on its under side, is pressed to the stone on top of which the initiand is sitting - more or less unconscious. This is done, so I was told, to make the penis " lighter and more beautiful." Into the bleeding wound a red pandanus blossom is inserted. The purpose of this is to keep the inside parts of the split penis as red as possible after the wound has been allowed to heal. After the operation a ceremonial round-dance is performed by the men present. The song which belongs to it could not be translated for me, but it seems, as I was told by Dr. Petri, to come from Dampierland. Its lines go as follows : Bururu wonina nal Bururu Bururu Wonina nal wontfet tferanga tferanga golu Wonina tferanga tferanga.</page><page sequence="3">i6o NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION Sometime after the operation the cutting of the cicatrices begins, and goes on for some time. The wounds are filled with clean sand to cause marks to grow. My informants told me a myth of the origin of subincision. As is well known in these parts of Australia, the Wondjinas are represented on the rock painting as roughly anthropomorphic beings. They are believed to cause and to be the rain. They emanate out of Ungud - the eternal dreamtime - a being mostly represented as a snake which unites in it the conception of time as well as that of the creative principle of the world. The Wondjina Kalaru threw, according to the myth, the first flash of lightning over the sky. To do so he had painted himself with yellow colour. Yellow serpent- like lines crossed on his chest going from the shoulder of one side down to the leg of the other. These represented snakes. The flash of lightning is really also a yellow snake and every throwing stick should be painted with yellow serpent-lines also - as newly made ones often are, for they " belong " to the yellow snake and the flash of lightning as well as do the spear and the spearheads of stone. The Wondjina Kalaru threw the first flash of lightning by splitting his penis and letting out the fire and the flash of lightning. He created the fire by turning outside the red inside of the split penis till the fire came out. He can direct the flash of lightning by taking his penis in his left hand and showing the direction he wants the flash to go with a club in his right hand. In this way he may hit his enemies and split trees into firewood. This myth was related to me after a heavy thunderstorm. During this thunder- storm I had seen some men jumping while holding their penis in the left hand and gesticulating wildly with clubs in the right hand towards each flash of lightning which dashed over the dark sky. The men told me later that they believed to be able like Wondjina Kalaru to split trees into firewood by directing the flash. There exists also a myth referring to cicatrization. It was introduced by two alligators who both belonged to the same totem group, in this case the totem group of Banar, " wild turkey." One alligator asked the other to cut marks on him. " Where," asked the other and pointed at the head of the first. This one said " No." He also refused to be cut on his stomach but wanted it to be done on his chest, his shoulders and his back. And so it was done. The initiation of the girls also seems to be a re-enacting of a mythical event. The crude defloration is performed by an elder man of the same marriage-group as the girl. He, so I was told, wraps round his finger some thread spun from kangaroo- hair, and executes the defloration with it. After that the men of her intermarrying group who happen to be present have intercourse with her. The myth on which this custom is based refers to the two totem heroes in the eternal dreamtime ; Kuranguli and Banar, who are believed to be ancestors of the exogamous moieties. Kuranguli and Banar lived for a while in the old country Kalimbi. Banar went far away to another country. He found the fire and a sweetheart. He returned with her to Kalimbi. After that Kuranguli also went far away and he too found a sweetheart. They both lived with their wives in Kalimbi. But they both lived in the right way for the wife of Banar belonged to the Kuranguli-side and that of</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION 161 Kuranguli to the Banar-side, that is, the partner of each belonged to the opposite marriage -group. After a while Banar's wife had a daughter and the wife of Kuranguli gave birth to a son. The two children grew and Kuranguli demanded the daughter of Banar as a wife for his son. But Banar refused. He loved his daughter himself and slept with her. Kuranguli said to Banar : " Why do you keep your daughter away from us ? I want her to marry my son." Banar answered : " No, I want her as a wife for my own son." Kuranguli said : " This is not right." Banar confessed : " I love my own daughter. I have become used to her and sleep with her." Kuranguli said again : " This is not right. I will give you my own daughter if you will give your daughter to my son." Banar refused again. Kuranguli went away and wrapped thread round his finger, got hold of his own daughter and opened her vagina with his finger and enlarged the opening. Then he showed the girl to Banar. When Banar saw the opened and enlarged vagina of Kuranguli's daughter a keen desire to sleep with her overcame him at once. He took her and went away with her. His own daughter he treated in the same way as Kuranguli had done and rendered her to Kuranguli. Then Banar said to Kuranguli : " So I give my daughter as a wife to your son. But you should not look at her mother because she is my wife and belongs to me." Kuranguli said : " It shall be like that. I only take the daughter and do not look at the mother. But you shall never again sleep with a girl when you have slept with her mother." Banar said : " Alright." According to this myth Kuranguli is credited with the establishment of the exogamous marriage-law and the custom of defloration which may only be executed by a man of the same marriage-group as the girl. Banar is regarded as a founder of the " rambar-law," that is the custom which forbids a man to look at or speak with his mother-in-law. A man marries a girl by paying to her parents some gifts and is then her legal husband. That means that she is collecting food for him alone. But it does not mean that her sexual relations are limited to him alone. A man who would not lend her occasionally or at certain ceremonial feasts to his " brothers," that is to those men who could have been legal husbands to her according to the tribal kinship- system, would be regarded as very " greedy." So a woman remains in circulation almost all her life. Very often married women elope with a lover. This is regarded as nothing extraordinary as long as the lover is also of the right kin, that is, a possible husband. If not, such an elopement would be regarded as a major crime and punished as such. The lover would be pursued by the relatives of the husband and when caught severely wounded with spears. How the women would be punished I don't know. In normal cases of elopement the husband will pursue the lover alone and fight with him. The woman will follow the victor, whereas the loser remains unconscious on the spot. The duel is fought with clubs only and no major injuries are likely. The woman will receive a severe beating from her husband if he is the victor. But I</page><page sequence="5">IÓ2 NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION also met a woman who permanently eloped and returned to her husband and was never punished by him. She explained " he loves me far too much to beat me/' Most eloped women return to their husbands after a while. Various love-charms are used by men and women. The men oñer meat or tobacco to the women they want to elope with, which they have " sung " with magic. Women do the same, but mostly they pursue for days with flattering songs the men with whom they have fallen in love. They always sit down beside them and caress them until the man is completely dizzy and elopes even if his reason should strongly advise him against such an adventure. Older couples frequently show real and deep attachment for each other. In case of absence of the husband the women sit there for days waiting for them and watching all the time the direction in which the returning husband is to be expected. The men never ask for anything. The women live in real harmony with their men and seem to understand without words what is wanted of them. I have often seen a man working and his wife watching him intensely and giving him into his hand the tool or object which was required at the moment. All aboriginals refer to sexual intercourse as " play." With regard to physical paternity, some deny any relation between the sexual act and pregnancy, while others admit that sexual intercourse has something to do with pregnancy among animals or even among white men, but still deny such a relation in their own case. The latter became clear in a long discussion between a missionary and some aborigines. The missionary wanted to raise the falling birthrate of his people and was in his innocence admonishing the men to sleep more frequently with their wives. But these men could not see the connection between this sort of " play " and the birth- rate. Only after long discussions they agreed that there might be some connection. The cause of pregnancy in the opinion of the aborigines is a dream. In this dream the soul of the father wanders around in the country and meets somewhere - mostly at the water-place where his own soul has emanated - a so-called spirit-child. After having dreamt a spirit-child in this way, he hands it over in a second dream to his wife. Without a dream they say a woman cannot become pregnant. This dream is often more a vision which occurs during normal daily life. A man " sees " a little snake or a small fish which disappears as suddenly as it appeared. In this way he becomes aware of " having found a child/' It is not necessary that he gives this spirit-child to a woman at once, he may keep it for years by " fastening it into his hair." These dreams seldom do occur isolated. They are accompanied by others which involve the totemistic beliefs. In the " child-dream " a man goes back to the place where he came from, that is the water-place, the Wondjina, the Ungud, from where his own " soul " originally emanated. Venereal diseases are comparatively recent. Being introduced through contact with civilization, they are regarded as a main feature of it. The impact of civilization is expressed by the aborigines in new and secret ceremonies. These ceremonies resemble very much the old ones but to-day the spiritual beings which are regarded as the creators of those ceremonies unite in themselves all the features of civilization</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION 163 so far as they are known to the aborigines. A person with knowledge of those secret ceremonies is able to defend himself against the new venereal diseases and leprosy, and on the other hand can afflict others in a magical way with them. The spreading of venereal diseases is regarded as a sign of the presence and power of those spiritual beings. There are women's dances called maui. In maui a woman is " boss " of a large rally of aborigines. Several women dance stark naked before the men ; to every woman a man is assigned who must sit before her, regard her with fixed eyes and after the dance sleep with her. At such dances the ordinary marriage-rules are broken and as I was told, the " woman-boss " sees to it that only such partners meet who normally should keep away from each other. The aborigines regard maui as some- thing unpleasant and dangerous but the law of maui is severe and compels them to partake as soon as it reaches the territory. As always, members of different tribes meet at such a corroboree ; it, therefore, does much to spread venereal diseases. The aborigines, ignorant of natural science, see psychic powers at work. They regard sex functions as " play/1 and do not realize the consequences of the physical act, even if they admit some knowledge about these facts regarding animals. The necessity of a physical act as cause of fertility goes unnoticed. They see and realize a psychic event which they call a " dream." Possibly fertility and pregnancy among them are not based on a physical act alone but on a psychic disposition as well. Modern research has shown that human fertility is dependent on psychic well-being also. Regarding the life of the aborigines, they are dependent on a psychic atmosphere which is mainly created and controlled by their medicine-men. It may be justifiable to regard psychic factors in their life even more important than modern research has shown them to be in ours. Consequently the aborigines may be right in claiming that their falling birth- rate in recent times is due to the mental disturbance which is caused by the news of the approaching civilization. According to their opinion they " cannot find the proper dreams " any more which are necessary for fertility, and they explain that they either have to do too much heavy work at the missions and stations and sleep too deeply to dream properly, or that they " think too much about white men " in their dreams. Possibly the aborigines in this way point out correctly the reason of the falling birth-rate : the disturbance of their whole psychic life and their peace of mind by the facts and news of the approaching civilization. In a later phase of contact with civilization the falling birth-rate may be easily connected with the infection with venereal disease. In this early stage it may be caused by the lack of the necessary psychic disposition. On the other hand this dream may not only be a condition of fatherhood and pregnancy but at the same time a consequence of it. Instead of realizing the facts of pregnancy or fatherhood by way of the conscious mind, these realities may come by the way of the subconscious, that is by dreams which express these realities. That their exists in their subconscious mind some idea about physiological</page><page sequence="7">IÓ4 NOTES ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND INITIATION paternity is betrayed by their language. The word for sperm, " wondjir," is obviously connected with " Wondjina," the god of rain and fertility. So perhaps we can leave the question of knowledge about physical paternity to the division of the human mind into a conscious and a subconscious part. There is in this case no conscious knowledge of it, but a subconscious idea which expresses itself in dreams and symbols. The question of the origin of subincision may be regarded from the same point of view. The myth which places the origin of fire and lightning into the penis of a Wondjina certainly is an expression of a subconscious " notion " of sexual power- As there exists no corresponding knowledge of it in the conscious mind, these symbols cannot be understood in their right way. They are misinterpreted and re-enacted " literally " so to speak. All other explanations which point out that the operation is executed for a certain " purpose " are certainly later inventions and have nothing to do with the origin of this custom.1 A. Lommel. 1 The field-work on which this article is based, was done as a member of the Frankfurt Museum expedition to north-western Australia in 1938.</page></plain_text>
