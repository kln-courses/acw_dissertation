Some scholars, Wolff not the least of them,2 do not rely on the parallel in Exodus but on the import of the rest of the book of Amos-Israel's disobedience in the past merited various responses but now requires Yahweh's personal, punitive presence in the destruction and woe of the people. Neither epic precedents nor divine anger, however, fully explain the background of this image. I propose that Amos's image 1 See, among others, William Rainey Harper, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Amos and Hosea (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1905) 127; E.

The Setting in Amos The liturgical background of Amos's vocabulary is well documented.3 A. Bentzen showed how the oracles against the nations in 1:2-2:16 have a "literary pattern."4 Walter Brueggemann, following Reventlow, interpreted 4:4-13 as a unit of material from a liturgy of covenant renewal. Its heart is the phrase, "prepare to meet thy God, O Israel" (4:12c), derived from holy war traditions.5 The ritual background of Amos is even more obvious in his criticism of its abuses in 4:4-5; 5:21-23, 25; and especially 5:18-20.6 Whether Amos was a cultic func- tionary,7 a disaffected former cultic functionary,8 or simply making use of cultic language for rhetorical and persuasive purposes remains a topic of scholarly discussion. In any case, Amos's reliance on the language and practice of the cult for his prophetic message is unmistakable. Amos's concern with covenant is also unmistakable and reflected in his use of covenant language. Andre Neher has found Amos's covenant ideology paradigmatically stated in 3:2: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."9 Patrick Miller has noted language common to Assyrian treaty curses in 7:17 and to curses in Deut 28:30, 39 in 5:11.10 The oracle against Tyre indicts the people of that state for forgetting "the covenant of brotherhood" (1:9). The oracles against Judah and Israel in 2:4-16 are notable in that Yahweh will punish them because "they have rejected the law of Yahweh, and not kept his statutes, but their lies have led them astray, after which their fathers walked" (2:4). 3 Some prefer to emphasize the Wisdom tradition influencing Amos instead.

HAUAN It is clear that Yahweh is prosecuting a case of broken covenant against his people and Amos is his spokesman. Amos depicts Yahweh armed with a rich arsenal of punishments to inflict on covenant breakers. He sends fire to devour them (1:4), cuts off inhabitants and slays them (1:5; 2:3), sends them into exile (1:5), turns his hand against them (1:8), presses down (2:13), smites them (3:15), breaks out like fire (5:6), delivers them up to destruction (6:8), rises against them with the sword (7:9), and more. Amos's image in 5:17b of Yahweh simply passing through is unique for its lack of intrin- sic horror. Yet the result is horrible enough: In all the squares there shall be wailing; and in all the streets they shall say, "Alas! alas!" They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation, and in all the vineyards shall be wailing. Further, if N. Tromp is correct in identifying a literary unit in 5:1-17,11 this stands in apposition to 5:2: "Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel; forsaken on her land, with none to raise her up." The verb describing Yahweh's appearance in 5:17 is cabar. Amos also uses it in 7:8 and 8:2 to describe Yahweh's intentions in phrases identical to each other: "I will never again pass by them." There, using a construction similar to Mic 7:18 and Prov 19:11, but with the opposite intent, Amos asserts that Yahweh's forgiveness of Jacob's transgressions is at an end. He will no longer repent as in the corresponding previous oracles (7:3 and 7:6). He will no longer benignly pass by, but will pass through-in judgment. Problems in Past Interpretations It is true that in Exod 12:12 Yahweh passes through the midst of Egypt in judgment. But Amos probably did not rely on the epic sources of Exodus for this use of c(bar as so many commentators have sug- gested.12 Scholars widely identify the priestly stratum in the account of the tenth plague with 11:9-12:20, 28, 40-50; and 13:1-2.13 It is in this stratum that c(bar describes Yahweh's terrible visitation. The epic 1 N.

It is useful to note that the context of the Exodus epic, like Amos, is influenced by holy war traditions but, unlike Amos, lacks the theme of covenant violation or judgment. So for two reasons, the dis- similar use of words to describe Yahweh's activity and the dissimilar context, the Exodus epic is an unlikely source for Amos's image.15 James L. Crenshaw has proposed a theophanic source for Amos's language, noting that it "is steeped in the vocabulary of theophany."16 He identifies in the book of Amos "genuine passages" (among them 5:17; 7:8; 8:2),17 "passages of uncertain authorship"18 reflecting the theophanic tradition, and also "genuine passages with probable theo- phanic echoes."19 His case for the theophanic use of (abar is convinc- ing and he notes its parallel use in Exod 33:22 and 1 Kgs 19:11. What further commends his approach is the attention it draws to the cultic function of these specific passages. 20 What is nevertheless lacking, for our purposes, is an explanation for why (abar, among all the forms of describing theophany in Amos, is the image in 5:17 (with 7:8 and 8:2) for divine judgment. Unfortunately, Crenshaw associates its judgment character with Exod 12:12 and attributes the cries of "Alas! alas!" with shock that "the promise of rain and fertility . . . thought to accompany the theophany has been changed to a threat of drought and defeat."21 Though we find vivid descriptions of nature's response to theophany in passages like Judges 5, Psalm 68, and Habakkuk 3, this aspect of the divine presence is not dominant here. Yahweh does not appear in such passages with the word (abar, nor are covenant violations the specific 14The date of J/E is still a topic of discussion; see Noth, Pentateuchal Traditions, 228 -47. 15 This raises the interesting question of what the source is for P's use of (abar for the divine visitation. The connection may be the ritual association of (abar with the massbt feast of the league cult (cf. Joshua 5) in covenant renewal or it may originate with Amos. The significance of this is suggested later in this article. The Chronicler, interestingly, places both Josiah's covenant renewal and his Passover ("No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet" (2 Chr 35:18) in the same eighteenth year of his reign. 16 J.

Consequently, we must look elsewhere for clues to the meaning of this image. The Word cabar and Covenant Ritual The connection of cabar with covenant liturgy does occur elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. A crucial passage in this regard is Jer 34:17-20. King Zedekiah had "cut a covenant" with the people of Jerusalem in order to set free all male and female Hebrew slaves. But then the peo- ple turned around and took their slaves right back. Jeremiah then prophesied: Therefore, thus says Yahweh: You have not obeyed me by pro- claiming liberty, everyone to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, says Yahweh. And the men who transgressed (ha (obe- rim) my covenant did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me, I will make like the calf which they cut in two and passed between (wayya(abru) its parts-the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between (ha c(ber?m) the parts of the calf; and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives.22 Patrick Miller has noted that the wordplay using (abar here is part of a larger correspondence of sin and punishment in this passage.23 Being made like the calf that was passed between is a fitting end for those who passed by the covenant. The immediate basis for the wordplay and its poetic justice is that the word for transgression and the word for the act of passage in the covenant-making ritual share the same root- br. But it is important to note that the self-curse enacted in this rite is the cutting of the calf, not passage between the parts, and the fate of the transgressors is likewise cut. A similar covenant understanding is probably behind the ritual sum- monses described in Judg 19:11-20:48 and 1 Sam 11:1-10.24 In those two passages the motivation to obey the summons by the threat of judgment is presumably related to the cutting act in the league treaty ceremony. Scholars have long since noticed this covenant ideology, 22 There is a textual problem with vs 18. I follow the common emendation of the text from ha cegelto kc cegel. 23 Patrick D.

First, the use of (abar here does not describe Yahweh's action, as it does in Amos-there is no theophany. This is perhaps because Yahweh was not a party to the covenant. Second, Jeremiah, like P, postdates Amos-this is not a source for Amos's image. But it does give a useful indication of the close connection between the ritual of cutting a covenant and the punishment fit for its violation. Finally, 'abar is not directly involved in this connection between ritual and pun- ishment. It is used to describe an important part of the covenant liturgy but it is probably not used, especially in the light of extra- biblical evidence, to impose a curse or prescribe a judgment. We can assume that the covenant ritual Jeremiah describes and the ideological complex that permitted his wordplay were well known to Amos. We find such knowledge employed, for example, in Deut 29:10-12, where (abar is part of a formula for covenant making: You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God . . . that you may enter into (lc(obreka) the sworn covenant of Yahweh your God, which Yahweh your God makes (koret) with you this day. 25 See Dennis McCarthy, Treaty and Covenant (Rome: Biblical Institute, 1978). 26 The translation is from Gerhard F. Hasel, "The Meaning of the Animal Rite in Genesis 15," JSOT19 (1981) 61-78. He notes that the Aramaic verb for "cut up," gzr, is equivalent to Hebrew krt, used for cutting a covenant. For complete text and transla- tion see Joseph Fitzmyer, The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1967). 27 See McCarthy, Treaty and Covenant, and Hasel, "Animal Rite." 28 Hasel, "Animal Rite," 68. 29 Cross, Canaanite Myth, 266 n. 342</page><page sequence="7">M. J. HAUAN Also, in Gen 15:7-21 a ritual with similarities to the one in Jeremiah is described. Abram cuts up several animals, after which symbols for Yahweh's presence, a smoking pot and flaming torch, appear and pass between the parts. What has often troubled scholars about this image, that by passing through the animals Yahweh seemed to be calling sanc- tions on himself,30 is a result of the widespread notion that it is the act of passage in the covenant rite that subjects one to sanctions.31 There is no evidence that this is the case. A brief summary of the facts is in order here. Passage rites do not appear in the relevant West Semitic covenant parallels. Neither do they play a role in Judges 19 or 1 Samuel 11. The role of cbr in Jeremiah 34 is to establish the wordplay-cutting remains the acted-out self-curse. In Genesis 15, the passage of Yahweh is a direct response to Abram's question, "How am I to know that I shall possess it?" (Gen 15:8)- there is no mention of self-imposed sanctions. So (abar is used to describe a part of a covenant rite but that part appears to be distinct from the self-curse involved in cutting. Jeremiah 34 affords little help in determining just what part the act of passage plays in the covenant rite. But in Genesis 15 the crucial factor is that it is used to describe Yahweh's part. It is a theophanic term, as in Amos. The Theophanic Aspect of (abar and Covenant Ritual The theophanic use of (abar outside Amos occurs in several pas- sages. Three of the most important are Genesis 15 (as we have seen), Exodus 33-34, and Joshua 3-4. These passages display some remark- able similarities. All three contain a naming of the God who is appear- ing. In Gen 15:7 Yahweh identifies himself: "I am Yahweh who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to pos- sess." In Exod 34:5-6 Yahweh also identifies himself: 30 As H. H. Rowley has said, "It is hard to see how God could be exposed to sanc- tions," and explained the situation as an anthropomorphism (Worship in Israel: Its Form and Meaning [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1967] 30). Others try to explain how Yahweh's self-curse might work; cf. Claus Westermann, Genesis 12-50 (Darmstadt: Wissenschaft- liche Buchgesellschaft, 1975). 31 Hasel's study is a great help in clearing up this problem. He calls the events in Genesis 15 a "covenant ratification sacrifice." In his concentration on the animal-cutting aspect of this covenant ritual, however, he never fully differentiates it from the act of passing through. Thus he can claim that "Gen 15:7-21 contains covenant-making in which Yahweh binds himself to Abram in the passing through the animals" ("Animal Rite," 70). 343</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW And Yahweh descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of Yahweh. Yahweh passed (wayyacbor) before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. This was prefigured in Exod 33:19 where Yahweh says, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name, 'Yahweh.'" In Josh 3:9 the naming is in the mouth of Joshua: "Come hither, and hear the words of Yahweh your God." Not quite so significant, perhaps, is the fact that in each passage something is cut: animals in Genesis 15, tablets in Exodus 34, and the waters of the Jor- dan in Joshua 3-432 More significantly, though, in each passage cabar is used to describe Yahweh's appearance: a smoking pot and flaming torch pass between the parts in Genesis 15, Yahweh's "goodness" or Yahweh himself passes by Moses (though not between the tablets) in Exodus 34,33 and the ark of the covenant passes before the people and through the cut-off waters of the Jordan in Joshua 3-4. In each case, Yahweh's theophany is an assurance or confirmation for the people with whom he makes the covenant-to confirm to Abram that he will possess the land (Gen 15:8), to make it known that Moses and the peo- ple had found favor in Yahweh's sight (Exod 33:16), and to convince the people at the Jordan that there was a living God among them (Josh 3:10). Furthermore, each passage contains a promise speech containing a list of the peoples that Yahweh will drive out and whose land the Israelites will possess. Gen 15:18-21: On that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendents I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Kenites, the Keniz- zites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites." 32 The Joshua passage is reminiscent of the mythical battle of Yahweh with Rahab the sea monster, the older Baal cycle from Ugarit, and their associations with Exodus. But the word used in Ps 89:10 and Isa 51:9 is not karat. See Cross, Canaanite Myth, 112-44. 33 A similar episode occurs in 1 Kgs 19:11 without covenant associations. Its depen- dence on the covenant episode in Exodus 34 is likely, however, for the point seems to be likening Elijah to Moses and modifying the storm-type view of theophany. 344</page><page sequence="9">M. J. HAUAN Exod 34:11: Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Periz- zites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Josh 3:10-11: And Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Gir- gashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is to pass over ((cber) before you into the Jordan." In each of these examples, the last quite explicitly, the passage of Yahweh performs a confirmatory, sealing function for the promise of the land. Finally, in Genesis 15 and Exodus 33-34 there are explicit references to "cutting" the covenant and it can be presumed that the events described in Joshua 3-4, perhaps in conjunction with the feast in Joshua 5, also involved a covenant renewal ceremony. In short, these passages share the following characteristics: a) a proclamation of Yahweh's name b) something is cut c) an (tbar theophany d) a reason for the theophany e) a list of the nations Yahweh promises to drive out f) a covenant context Another passage worth noting is the Deuteronomic covenant conclu- sion speech in Deut 29:1-20 and 31:1-13. The use of (abar in 29:12 has already been mentioned. But'we also find in 31:3, in the context of strengthening and encouraging the people, that "Yahweh your God himself will go over (c(ber) before you; he will destroy these nations before you, so that you shall dispossess them." Again, this specific theophany appears in a context of covenant conclusion and the destruc- tion of the nations, though in this case one step removed from the actual celebration. To elucidate the precise setting of c(bar as a formula for Yahweh's theophany in covenant liturgy in these passages and elsewhere will require more detailed consideration than the scope of this paper allows. 345</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW But the simple evidence above indicates more than a coincidental use of the term. 34 We can postulate, then, that influencing these passages was a covenant ritual ceremony either for establishing a new covenant or for renewal, which involved a theophany that took the form of a passage and was described with the word cabar. This was accompanied by a proclamation of the divine name and by the divine promise. The smoking pot and flaming torch from Genesis 15 may have been actual symbols of the divine presence in such a rite, as the ark of the covenant was in Joshua 3 -4.35 The theophanic passage was, in its sim- plest form, a confirmation or seal on Yahweh's promise of the land to Israel. It did not involve a self-curse or sanctions. Its origin may have been in some kind of cultic reenactment ceremony of the early league. Amos 5:1 7b Reconsidered The understanding we now have of the background to the image in vs 5:17b has some interesting implications for interpreting its role in Amos's prophetic work. We can see more clearly than before Amos's familiarity with ritual language and forms, in this case with the covenant ritual, and how he relied on that familiarity to pursue his con- cern for Israel's covenant with Yahweh. c(bar is a theophanic term used to describe Yahweh's role in a covenant ritual. The proclamation of the divine name in 5:8, at the middle of the unit 5:1-17, may further confirm this. In their celebrations of covenant renewal, perhaps at Bethel in the cultic "Day of Yahweh,"36 Israelites proclaimed Yahweh's name and pictured Yahweh passing through or by in a reconfirmation of the covenant which gave them their land and prom- ised fulfillment. Amos, the spokesman for Yahweh's case of broken covenant against Israel, completely reverses this happy picture. On the land Israel is forsaken, "fallen, no more to rise," and Yahweh's passing will not confirm the promises of the covenant but exact judgment and bring woe. 34 The P stratum in Exodus 12, e.g., might be profitably reevaluated in the light of this evidence and the tradition history and function of the Passover/Massot festival. See n. 15. 35 Cf. the pillar of smoke and fire traditions in Exod 13:21; 33:9, 10; Deut 31:15. 36 The relationship of the "Day of Yahweh" to traditions of holy war has been noted by Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology (2 vols.; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965) 2. 119-25. The initiation of holy war is also an important feature of Joshua 3-4 and so, perhaps, (abar theophany. Cf. Brueggemann, "Amos IV 4-13," 2, on Amos 4:12c men- tioned above, which with 5:17b completes the same pattern. 346</page><page sequence="11">M. J. HAUAN In vss 7:8 and 8:2, "I will never again pass by them," the meaning that Yahweh will no longer repent in his intention to punish Israel37 now has a very concrete aspect, horrible for Israel. Yahweh, having passed by or about to pass by in a terrible conclusion to his relationship with Israel will never do so again. No wonder Amaziah reports to Jero- boam that "the land is not able to bear his words. For thus Amos has said, 'Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land'" (7:10-11). The gift of the land is Israel's por- tion in the covenant ceremonies in which Yahweh appears with the word c(bar. Jeroboam is the king of that land and Bethel a temple of the kingdom. Amos threatens all this-the promissory cornerstone of Yahweh's covenant with Israel-in his indictment of them for breaking the covenant. This is indeed a sour note on what must have been a happy day of celebration in the Bethel cult. Reversal, in this case of the image of covenant theophany, is typical of Amos's style. Broadly speaking, it marks the fate of all the nations and of the Davidic empire in the oracles in 1:3-2:16. The force that established them is about to turn against them. The appropriateness of such reversal is similar to that employed in the covenant cutting ritual we observed in Jeremiah. Israel's values-perversion of justice, violence, and ignorance of right-are the reverse of what the covenant requires. In response, Amos reverses the value of cultic celebration in 4:4-5: Come to Bethel, and transgress; to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days; offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them; for so you love to do, O people of Israel! He reverses the image of the great acts of Yahweh into sending famine, drought, blight, pestilence, and war (4:6-11).38 The great "Day of Yahweh" Amos calls "darkness, and not light" (5:18), and the wealth and glory of Israel are reversed into signs of impending annihilation when Yahweh "will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation" (8:10). So, too, is the image in 5:17b reversed from 37 See above, in the discussion on The Setting in Amos. 38 This rehearsal may also be a transformed version of what would typically begin a covenant ceremony, namely a recitation of the magnalia dei. 347</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a joyful confirmation of Yahweh's covenant with Israel into a dreadful judgment. Finally, we must briefly note the possible implications of the above argument for our understanding of the immediate setting of 5:17b. With its image of a reverse theophany of judgment, it forms the climax of the unit 5:1-17. On the preceding unit, 4:4-13, Brueggemann's analysis has discovered evidence indicating its basis in covenant liturgy.39 Further, the following unit, 5:18-20, on the "Day of Yahweh" also has connections with the establishment of the covenant, via the victory of Yahweh over his primordial enemies and over the enemies of Israel. 40 As we have seen in the passages considered above, the displacement of the nations from the land which Israel is to possess is an integral part of Yahweh's covenant confirmation. This suggests that the entire section from 4:4-5:20 is informed by traditions of covenant celebration which Amos reverses in announcing Yahweh's prosecution of Israel. The peculiar invitation in 4:4, "Come to Bethel, and transgress," may thus be the beginning of Amos's rhetorically reversed celebration of covenant renewal on the "Day of Yahweh." In 5:17b Amos describes Yahweh's theophany to judge disobedient Israel. His language is set in a liturgical and covenantal context. The use of the word (abar is not an allusion to the Exodus epic but rather derives from a specific tradition of covenantal ritual theophany which Amos reverses into a judgment theophany. This reversal of covenant theophany from promise to doom may originate with Amos himself and it is typical of his style. It is analogous to the prophetic transformation of Yahweh's holy war on behalf of Israel to war against Israel. 41 39 Cf. Brueggemann, "Amos IV 4-13." 40 Cf. Cross, Canaanite Myth. The discussion in chaps. 4 and 5 is especially useful. 41 My thanks to Saul Olyan of the University of Winnipeg for his encouragement and helpful suggestions and to Professor Frank Moore Cross of Harvard University for whose course, "The History of the Religions of Israel," this paper was written. 348</page></plain_text>
