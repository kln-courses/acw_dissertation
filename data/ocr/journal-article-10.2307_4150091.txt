On the whole, this pub- lication provides an important descriptive contribution to our understanding of the material culture of the Pottery Neolithic. One of the highlights of this work is the out- standing descriptive presentation of visual materials. This is a richly illustrated work, with a wealth of high-quality illustrations and photographs. The publication is well or- ganized and will serve as an important reference for future archaeologists. The book is organized along traditional lines and is divided into descriptive sections that address the results of the excavation, material culture, art objects, and subsis- tence studies. Part I includes chapters on the background of the excavation, treatments of intensive surface collec- tion, magnetic investigations, and architecture and plan- ning. Part II, which explores material studies, includes descriptive treatments of the pottery, petrographic analysis of the pottery, and a very interesting short examination of experimental ceramic production. It also contains chap- ters that address the stone tool industry, research on con- joinable flint pieces, and the groundstone tools. Part III provides several chapters that center on aspects of the re- covered anthropomorphic figurines. This includes descrip- tions and categorization of the figurines, consideration of their spatial distribution, the use of medical computed to- mography (MCT) for the study of the anthropomorphic figurines, and the possible functions of these figurines. The final section, Part IV, largely focuses on subsistence stud- ies. This includes preliminary treatments of palaeoethno- botany and faunal analysis, and a conclusion chapter by the senior author exploring the effects of population size on the human organization at Sha'ar Hagolan. Many of the chapters in this study make important con- tributions to our understanding of the Pottery Neolithic pe- riod. Among these is a solid descriptive chapter (chapter 5) on architectural remains. This chapter is well illustrated with many clear black-and-white photographs of features and buildings, and with plan views of buildings. Each of the major features and rooms is described, which will serve as important comparative cases for other researchers work- ing on this period. One of the other critical chapters to emerge from this work is that of the treatment of the pot- tery. This chapter, which is unquestionably the descriptive crown jewel of this book, could serve as the instruction manual for pottery description for this period: it is clear, extremely well organized, provides raw data (including unit numbers), and is beautifully illustrated. The typological system is clearly presented, with the authors providing photographic and illustrative examples for each type. The text descriptions are detailed and linked to the illustrations and description key. There is also a short, and in some ways incomplete, consideration of vessel function. Com- plementing the descriptions of the ceramics, the following chapter offers a preliminary consideration of experimental pottery production. Another important contribution to this work is seen in chapter 10, "The Flint Knapping Industry." This chapter provides a useful description of the site's assemblage. As with the other chapters, this one is well illu- strated, organized, and relatively detailed. However, the title of this chapter is somewhat misleading: the chapter largely focuses on describing, cataloging, and illustrating chipped stone tools and does not really provide a consideration of Pottery Neolithic flint knapping technology and industry. The chapters on Neolithic clay female figurines, as with the rest of the volume, are highly descriptive with detailed presentations of photographic and illustrative materials. The authors have adopted an art historical, rather than an- thropological, approach with the female figurines from Sha'ar Hagolan. They provide the reader with detailed descriptive studies with limited ethnographic or compara- tive perspective. Chapter 16, which deals with the func- tion of anthropomorphic figurines, is a welcome departure from this trend. Michele Miller provides an admirable exploration of some critical anthropological questions, including who made the figurines, where they were manu- factured, and how people used them in the past. Her study echoes earlier works, such as that of Garfinkel (1995) and Gopher and Orrelle (1996), in speculating on the mean- ing of Yarmukian figurines by examining the symbolism represented in their features. This work is broadly cross- cultural, looking at a wide range of ethnographic and an- thropological contexts to derive meaning. In light of the priority placed on solid descriptive treat- ments, it should come as no surprise that the weakest chapters in this book deal with regional comparisons, in- terpretation, and synthesis. For example, in chapter 6, the authors place the architecture of Sha'ar Hagolan in the context of the broader Near East. The main organizational theme here is one of architectural typology based on the shape of structures from across the entire Near East. While providing good illustrations of excavated Near Eastern sites, the authors envision these as a single data set, with limited consideration that these are actually from different periods and represent geographically separate cultures. There are also a few chapters that are underdeveloped and incomplete. Perhaps the most notable of these is the final chapter 19. Although entitled "Conclusions: The Effect of Population Size on the Human Organization at Sha'ar Hagolan," this chapter does not attempt to provide a con- clusion or synthesis of the earlier chapters. This is un- fortunate in that it leaves the reader with a series of related and unrelated descriptive reports, with no sense of the im- portance or links among these data sets. While claiming to explore the possible links between settlement size and or- ganization at Sha'ar Hagolan, this short chapter fails to address this relationship in any detail and is largely limited to a brief examination of the possible impact of popula- tion pressure at Sha'ar Hagolan. This discussion, while</page><page sequence="3">70 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 336 well organized, is poorly developed and draws upon ques- tionable ethnographic analogues. For example, in a dis- cussion of kinship reorganization, the author bases his argument strictly upon research by Friesen (1999) among the Inuit of the Mackenzie Delta of northern Canada. Given that these are highly mobile hunter-gatherers living in the Arctic, and with an economy focused upon hunting sea mammals and fishing, it is important for the author to articulate how this analogue is helpful for the reader to understand sedentary village life among agriculturalists- pastoralists in a Mediterranean woodland environment. Unfortunately, the author does not do this, ultimately re- ducing the strength of his ethnographic comparison and his broader argument. Moreover, the author's attempts to ex- plore the effects of scalar stress and population pressure are undermined by limited or no consideration of current pub- lished literature, including some that have addressed this topic in the context of the Neolithic of the Near East (e.g., Cohen 1977; Hershkovitz and Gopher 1990; Kuijt 2000; Wood 1998). Collectively, this publication illustrates the critical im- portance of expanded horizontal exposure in learning about the organization of archaeological settlements in general, and the Pottery Neolithic in specific. The broad horizontal excavation at Sha' ar Hagolan has uncovered ex- tensive architectural remains and features and placed these into a spatial context. As a result of the extensive scale of these excavations, this project provides important new in- sights into village organization not seen at other Pottery Neolithic settlements. Understanding the spatial organiza- tion of archaeological sites is, of course, a problem faced by all researchers. In most cases, however, financial limi- tations, the large size of most Neolithic settlements, and the need to develop a detailed understanding of stratigra- phy and spatial relationships restrict the degree to which we can understand Pre-Pottery and Neolithic settlements. Despite the important descriptive contributions of this work, there are several limitations to this publication and research. One of the limitations is that there is no consid- eration of chronology and site formation at the site. While a series of radiocarbon dates is presented in one chapter, there is no detailed treatment of chronology at the site or context level. The major operating assumption of the au- thors is that the uncovered architecture at Sha'ar Hagolan is contemporaneous and from one occupational period of the Pottery Neolithic. For example, the authors make the following statement (p. 82): "Unlike the common view that the sixth millennium BC was a period of regression and decline in settlement organization in the southern Levant, Sha'ar Hagolan Area E reveals an elaborate example of courtyard structures built along streets and alleys." The problem with this assertion, as well as the broader inter- pretative foundation within which cultural materials are presented within this book, is that the approach that the associations and coexistence between all of these architec- tural features is assumed and not demonstrated. The au- thors, for example, have made no attempt to determine if individual structures within a courtyard system were built and used at the same time, or if the courtyard system is the result of multiple structures that were used at different stages of the same period. Other than a few trench profiles in the chapter on remote sensing, as well as republishing a schematic illustration from 1952, there are no excavation profiles or sections published from the excavation. In short, the authors present plan views of architecture with no un- derstanding of stratigraphy, depositional layers, or changes in architecture. This static view of architecture and the built environment runs counter to considerable research (e.g., Akkermans and Verhoeven 1995; Banning and Byrd 1987; 1989; Verhoeven 1999) that has illustrated that ar- chitectural systems are changing and dynamic. Banning and Bryd (1989), among others, have outlined that the built environment within archaeological sites, such as the renovation of buildings and construction of new buildings and features, is a regular occurrence in Neolithic settle- ments. As such, it is likely the excavators at Sha'ar Hago- lan have uncovered a compilation of architecture from different periods of a single phase of the Pottery Neolithic. This is, needless to say, an important issue with any ar- chaeology project, but is of critical importance when considering the long-term evolutionary importance of ar- chitectural patterning within an archaeological site. It is puzzling, therefore, why the researchers include no signif- icant consideration of how this archaeological site was formed, which features and structures were occupied at the same period, and the extent to which we should treat this as a contemporary village or a series of smaller occupa- tions over several hundreds of years. Although they do in- dicate from which unit number individual items may have been recovered, the researchers make no attempt to docu- ment the location and context of individual radiocarbon samples and address how they are or are not related to each other. Thus, the authors provide no consideration of site formation processes at Sha'ar Hagolan and how they may have influenced either the representation of different kinds of archaeological data recovered in excavation or the in- terpretations that have emerged from these data. Finally, there are several other aspects to this book that undermine what is otherwise an excellent descriptive site report for a little-known period of time. First, the research- ers make no serious attempt to link their work to regional- level practices, or perhaps more importantly, to explore how the excavation results from Sha'ar Hagolan inform us about various evolutionary processes and developments. From this perspective, the authors have missed an impor- tant opportunity to address a number of pivotal research questions, including (1) what Sha'ar Hagolan can tell us about the nature of social organization within early Pottery Neolithic communities; (2) whether there is architectural evidence for households; and (3) whether social relations</page><page sequence="4">2004 BOOK REVIEWS 71 existed along some looser organizational structure. Along similar lines, the authors fail to engage the reader with questions of economy. Having noted these limitations, however, it must be recognized that this work makes an important descriptive contribution to our understanding of the Pottery Neolithic. Some of the chapters, specifically those related to the ceramic and lithic materials, as well as the figurines, serve to define this stage of the Pottery Neolithic of the southern Levant. These are excellent de- scriptive works that will unquestionably represent for many years the model for systematic treatments of Pottery Neolithic material culture.
