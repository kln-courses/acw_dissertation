Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004, 474 pp., $27.50 (cloth). DOI: 10.1177/0891243204269612 In Evolution's Rainbow, Joan Roughgarden illustrates how the dynamics of gender, sexu- ality, and culture condition scientific practice. She demonstrates the ways a researcher's social location affects hypotheses and methods, thereby leading to distorted and partial accounts of nature's regularities. Roughgarden questions how biology can account for the population of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, transgendered, and intersexed persons. Her general conclusion is that each academic discipline has its own means of ignoring diver- sity in gender and sexuality. Most specifically, Roughgarden offers a close-grained examina- tion, and critique, of Darwin's theory of sexual selection. The most compelling part of the book is her analysis of an expansive biological literature on nonhumans that highlights contradictions between the claims of sexual selection and the data used to prove them. According to Roughgarden, Darwin's theory of sexual selection is outdated as it ignores the variations in sexual courting that do not follow the pattern of ardent male suitors pursuing discerning and/or deceitful females. Roughgarden covers hermaphro- dites, species that have several sexes, species whose organisms change sexes, species whose organisms behave in sex-atypical ways, and every form of polyandry, polygamy, monogamy, and group mating known to exist in the biological world. Instead of sexual selection, Roughgarden proposes a theory of "social selection" based on mutual cooperation in return for access to reproductive opportunities. "This theory pro- poses that animals evolve traits that qualify them for inclusion in groups that control resources for reproduction and safe places to live and raise offspring" (p. 6). Choice is not only about females finding the best or the strongest male to mate with but also about their finding the best match to be able to raise a family. In addition, she argues that the purpose of sex is not solely reproduction. Her theory opens up a great many possibilities for sexual behavior and partnering. Since nearly all behaviors and traits benefit survival of organisms, Roughgarden challenges the scientific community to figure out why animal homosexuality continues to exist. Roughgarden also covers gender/sexual diversity in human beings. She discusses the embryo and sex determination, including genes, chromosomes, hormones, and brain devel- opment. Roughgarden argues that gender identity is determined and fixed somewhere before the age of 1 and might be set as early as the third trimester (pp. 241-42). Similarly, Roughgarden argues that sexual orientation is set somewhere before the age of 10 and might be set as early as age 1 (p. 257). These early age limits on gender identity/sexual orientation ignore much of the socialization process, a stance that seems constricting in a book that oth- erwise argues for variation and malleability in most human developmental processes. The thesis she presents might legitimately be thought of as devolving into similar weak- nesses to the ones she so aptly describes. While Roughgarden is critical of researchers for inserting gender stereotypes into the scientific literature, using words such as stealing, para- sitism, deceit, and mimicry to describe animal behavior, her descriptions and interpretations also are anthropomorphic. When Roughgarden discusses animal behavior, she assumes it is consensual homosexual sex. I, as the reviewer of this book, am stating that it is impossible to know if animals are being fooled into homosexual sex or if they are consenting. One narra- tive is as plausible as the next.</page><page sequence="2">426 GENDER &amp; SOCIETY / June 2005</page></plain_text>
