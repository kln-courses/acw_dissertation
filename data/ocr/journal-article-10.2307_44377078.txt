<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abbey's Biocentric Epiphany: Desert Solitaire and the Teaching of Environmental Literature Terrell Dixon AS MORE AND MORE OF US WHO TEACH LITERATURE AND WRITING seek to focus our courses on environmental concerns and nature writing, we inevitably face questions about where and how to begin. What texts are central to this kind of teaching enterprise and why? I hope that this chronicle of my own experiences in thinking about and teaching literature and the environment will help others who want to plan their own courses. Focusing primarily on a single text will, I hope, give point and emphasis to arguments for the richness of the material. I chose Desert Solitaire as this text for two reasons. First, the characteristic tone of Edward Abbey's work sometimes lends itself to an easy, if unjustified, form of simplification. This can happen with those of us who admire his work as well as with his detractors, and the tendency is- like Joyce Carol Oates's well-known critique of the genre as "painfully limited" (236)- illustrative of how some readers would characterize the whole genre. Second, Abbey's recent death in March 1989 makes this an appropriate time for us as teachers and schol- ars to focus our attention on the achievement of his best-known and most important book. When we begin to think about Edward Abbey's writing and about Desert Solitaire , we are likely to turn, first, to those personal anecdotal segments that can stand alone as marvelous set pieces. A collection of essays about Edward Abbey bears the title Resist Much , Obey Little , and many of his most memorable stories embody that attitude of resistance. There is, for example, the early tale of ecotage (that is, sabotage in the service of eco- logical values) from Desert Solitaire. Abbey has just begun working as a seasonal ranger in Arches National Monument when he is visited by three Bureau of Public Roads employees. They are equipped with surveying tools and stakes- their job to plan the route for a new road through the park. Abbey knows that the road will transform the park from near wilderness into a site for Industrial Tourism complete with concrete roads, comfort stations, and far too many visitors. When they leave, he responds: 35</page><page sequence="2">Critic 54:1 Teamwork, that's what made America what it is today. Team- work and initiative. The survey crew had done their job: I would do mine. For about five miles I followed the course of their survey back toward headquarters, and as I went I pulled up each little wooden stake and threw it away, and cut all the bright ribbons from the bushes and hid them under a rock. (67) This and other wonderful stories of resistance, rebellion, and the humorous redefinition of American values in the protection of wilderness are so good and so accessible that it is tempting, even for those of us who are teachers and thus perhaps not prone to such temptations, to let them stand for the whole. To do so, however, is to be unfair to the richness of Abbey's best work and unfair also, I believe, to the role that this work can and should play in our attempts to teach and to understand the literature of wilderness. Let me illustrate by discussing briefly from my own teaching experiences with Abbey's writing and by trying to show why his work has come to hold a central place in my development of courses on literature and the environment. A few years ago, I began to develop some new courses at my university. Most of my teaching and research until then had been in contemporary fiction, but more and more of my own time was spent on reading about the environment. I was absorbed by the work of nature writers such as Abbey, Annie Dillard, Gretei Ehrlich, and Barry Lopez, with the books of field biologists such as David Mech and Frank Craighead, and with historians such as Micheal Cohen, Richard White, and Roderick Nash. In an attempt to get more of my own literary interests into the classroom, I devised a course for sophomores at the University of Houston built around this material. It was a course offered under the rubric of what we in the literature business call by the odd name Literary Nonfiction, and it was, I felt at the time, a little risky. There was the help of a good group of essays in the recently issued Modern Language publication called Teaching Environmental Literature , but there was no sense of a potential audience for this course on my campus. The time was the mid-eighties, several years before Earth Day 1990 and all the attendant renewal of media interest in environmental issues. Further, Houston was not Ogden, or Bozeman, or Laramie, or Eugene, but the nation's fourth largest city, located on the semitropical Gulf coast and characterized not by its access to nature but by its huge and crowded freeway system, its modernistic skyscrapers, its veneration of the petroleum business, and its space center. That first reading list was developed with some trepidation and much care. Finally, I decided to begin with Desert Solitaire. My theory was that Abbey's iconoclasm would carry the day, that his "defiance-is-beautiful" tone (Voice 27) would, at the very least, generate strong responses, good discussion. It did. Desert Solitaire , in fact, did this and much more; it served as a very useful introduction to the richness of contemporary nature literature. 36</page><page sequence="3">Terrell Dixon Desert Solitaire , first of all, helped students in the class re-educate them- selves about what constitutes literature. Such a re-orientation is necessary partly because our literature students have absorbed the prevailing val- ues of literary scholarship. As H. Ross Winterowd has noted in his recent book The Rhetoric of the Other Literature , literature as understood in the academy during much of the twentieth century has tended to make "'imagi- native' works central and other texts peripheral" (4), ascribing imaginative, creative power to a limited number of genres. Although Winterowd's book, books such as Chris Anderson's Literary Nonfiction : Theory ; Criticism , Peda- gogy and essays such as Paul Bryant's "Writing from a Tradition" signal the beginnings of important change and re-evaluation, real literature has long been understood to be poetry, prose fiction, and drama. Other forms of prose literature have usually been placed, if they appear in our English ma- jor curriculum at all, on the margins of our upper-division course offerings, lumped under such negative or limiting categories as "nonfiction." Other aspects of a typical student's university experience have reinforced this mis- leading separation and hierarchy. The essays that are seldom taught to our majors are often a staple of our freshman English classes. There, we value them chiefly as examples whereby beginning students can learn techniques to use in their own nonliterary essays. Our assumption is that once these techniques have been mastered, the student can then leave behind the ba- sic freshman learning experience and proceed to write analytical essays on literary theory or on works of fiction, poetry, and drama. Once we began confronting the complexity of Abbey's Desert Solitaire , students in this first sophomore class began to recognize the artificiality of these boundaries. The assumed hierarchical distinctions between imagina- tive and "nonimaginative" prose, between "real" literature and the creative essay, gradually began to seem less valid. The "Author's Introduction" it- self helped initiate this process. Once we emphasized that what the book presents, for artistic reasons, as one season's experience at Arches National Monument is actually a conflated version of several separate summers, the way was clear to see how Abbey constructs his narrative, how he employs his artistic imagination as well as his personal experience. Ann Ronald's discussion of how Desert Solitaire carefully crafts the distinctions between Edward Abbey the author and Ed the narrator helped with this realiza- tion. So did our discussion of Abbey's careful use of names in the book. He warns the reader that names of people have been changed to protect privacy and then proceeds to invent names for prominent characters in the book much in the manner of a nineteenth-century novelist; his companion on the trip down the "earth's original paradise of the Colorado" (174), for example, is appropriately called Newcomb, and the spiritually empty man who prospects the Canyon country for uranium is called A. T. Husk. By the time we looked at the careful use of Edenie imagery in early chapters such as "The First Morning" and "Serpents of Paradise," there was a clear 37</page><page sequence="4">Critic 54:1 sense in the classroom that this literary text was, in ways that mattered, imaginative. Despite its diversionary attack on "[sjerious critics, serious li- brarians, serious associate professors of English" (x), Desert Solitaire , with its carefully worded echoes of Thoreau and its thoughtful integration of an allegorical structure with a chronicle of Abbey's experiences, succeeds in being part of a creative, literary tradition. The richness of Desert Solitaire , its blend of environmental passion and artistic complexity, was thus a successful introduction to this sophomore- level study of literature and the environment. The one trying moment came early in the study of Desert Solitaire and from a totally unexpected angle. As the class discussed the book, I couldn't help but notice one increasingly agitated student at the back of the room. When we met after class, however, the source of his dissatisfaction was surprising. This student had spent the last six months living in Arches National Monument, reading and re-reading Desert Solitaire. What disturbed him so profoundly was not Abbey's environmentalism but our discussion of the book as if it were "just literature," rather than a religious text with all the unassailable power of received truth. Aside from this moment, one in which I experienced profound sympathy for all my colleagues who had ever taught courses in "The Bible as Literature," this class and subsequent classes for sophomores worked well. Despite my concerns, students- even students at a huge urban university- were not only environmentally minded but were also receptive to granting literary status to such writers as Abbey, John Graves, Ann Zwinger, Barry Lopez, and Gretei Ehrlich. Heartened, I began to consider what should constitute an advanced course in literature and the environment. Some of the same questions about artistic merit and the literary nature essay would also figure into these discussions, of course, but at this level I also wanted to emphasize such important questions of contemporary environmental literature and criticism as the rights of nature, the role of gender in nature writing, the role of ecofeminism in contemporary cultural and literary criticism, the de- bates about animal rights, and the interrogation and revision of American exploration and settlement history in terms of environmental values. I also wanted to explore the expression of biocentric values that I was begin- ning to see at the heart of contemporary American nature writing. Desert Solitaire again proved a richly provocative place to begin our semester's work. The "Down the River" chapter, for example, plunged us into consider- ations of gender in nature writing. Abbey, with characteristic complexity, brings up the question of gender, nature, and landscape writing from many different angles of vision. There is a moment of misogyny, perhaps mock misogyny, when he notes that "there are no women here" and asks if that is not "a blessing in disguise." Other aspects of what Lawrence Buell has called "American masculinist pastoral" figure in Abbey's early rendition of 38</page><page sequence="5">Terrell Dixon the river trip as providing alternately a maternal and then a sexual con- nection: My anxieties have vanished and I feel instead a sense of cradle- like security, of achievement and joy, a pleasure almost equiv- alent to that first entrance- from the outside- into the neck of the womb. We are indeed enjoying a very intimate relation with the river: only a layer of fabric between our bodies and the wa- ter I am fulfilling at last a dream of childhood and one as powerful as the erotic dreams of adolescence- floating down the river. Mark Twain, Major Powell, every man that has ever put forth on flowing water knows what I mean. (176) But these notions of masculine retreat into the landscape, cradling by and subjugation of a landscape conceived of as female, are then in them- selves complicated and criticized by what happens toward the end of the river trip. As he explores an abandoned mining camp on a ledge above the river, Abbey finds a cache of men's magazines that he sarcastically cat- egorizes as the All-Man He-Male type. Stag , Male , True, and others of the genre are lumped together and dismissed as part of the "familiar, fascinat- ing semimelancholy debris of free enterprise" (194). Elsewhere in this river narrative, Abbey quotes with approval the cowboy artist Charles Marion Russell's disdainful definition of a pioneer and thus joins in the criticism of what Annette Kolodny has called "the psychosexual dramas of men intent on possessing a virgin continent": I have been called a pioneer. In my book- a pioneer is a man who comes to virgin country, traps off all the fur, kills off the wild meat, cuts down all the trees, grazes off all the grass, plows the roots up and strings ten million miles of wire. A pioneer destroys things and calls it civilization. (191) Resolving this complex tangle of viewpoints in Desert Solitaire will obvi- ously be a formidable task, but even this limited summary of our seminar discussion makes it clear that Abbey's text actively and provocatively en- gages issues central to contemporary critical discourse on literature and the environment. Other central concepts come up in other sections of Desert Solitaire ; the scene in which Abbey kills the rabbit with a rock, for example, introduces animal rights issues and questions about the role of hunting in our culture and in our history. For now, however, I want to focus on his use of what I have come to see as a central, distinguishing feature of contemporary American nature writing: the biocentric epiphany. Among environmental 39</page><page sequence="6">Critic 54:1 philosophers and ethicists, biocentrism or deep ecology has become an in- creasingly important term. In reading such key works as Donald Worster's Nature's Economy and Deep Ecology by Bill Devall and George Sessions, the seminar studied the attempt to define the differences between a limited- that is a human-centered environmental thinking- and biocentrism. Sim- ply put, biocentrism seeks to privilege the whole ecological system rather than those parts of it that humans find attractive or useful. It seeks to free environmental philosophy from the narrowness of exclusively anthro- pocentric thinking, to grant other parts of life on the planet an integrity and value in themselves and not simply in their utility for us, to acknowledge, in other words, that nature is more than just a collection of natural re- sources. Such views are central to American nature writing.1 They inform the work of such otherwise diverse writers as Barry Lopez, Ann Zwinger, Gretei Ehrlich and Annie Dillard, thus bringing together some otherwise disparate elements of the growing body of nature literature. In essays by these writers, this biocentrism often finds expression in the artistic rendition of a key point in time. This moment when the biocentric nature of life suddenly manifests itself, when the writer suddenly feels, in John Graves's wonderful phrase, "that other pulse," is what we can call the biocentric epiphany. Out of context, I suppose both this term and the literary passages themselves could be open to the Oatesian charges that what nature writing offers is cheap "ONENESS," easy, automatic, and unearned "AWE" (236). To see the wrongness of this view, we need only turn once again to Desert Solitaire. I want to conclude by presenting a section that occurs toward the end of the book in a crucial chapter called "Dead Man at Grandview Point." I knew from earlier classes that there were pitfalls in teaching this section of the book; students could and often did identify with the dead tourist who did not know how to survive in the desert. Abbey's congratulations on the man's "good taste" in his choice of jumping-off spot and on his good luck in dying in the desert seemed to some of them unsympathetic, even arrogant. This time, however, I was able to relate the circumstances of Abbey's own final illness, his desert memorial service and burial. When students learned, first, that Abbey faced his own death by having himself cut off from the hospital machines and moved out into the desert to die and, then, that Abbey left careful instructions to be buried anonymously with rocks atop the grave to keep away the coyotes, they could more easily accept the views expressed here.2 This was, however, just one step in understanding the Grandview Point chapter. To appreciate its significance fully, we looked first at an earlier chapter that sets up a careful counterpoint to this one. In "The Serpents of Paradise," two gopher snakes, who may or may not be the same snakes who visited Abbey earlier, perform a dance, hypnotically intertwining and separating. Abbey crawls under his trailer to watch them, and they glide toward him; he panics, scrambles back, and they leave. His reflection 40</page><page sequence="7">Terrell Dixon on this event leaves no doubt about who in his view really enacted the serpent's separating role in the scene: "If I had been as capable of trust as I am susceptible to fear I might have learned something new or some truth so very old we have all forgotten it" (24). Abbey's Grandview Point passage, however, is epiphanic rather than regretful. The first parts of the chapter narrate the search for a dead tourist's body and the trip to bring it back from an isolated part of the park. The telling of this story enables Abbey to confront his own mortality, a confrontation that elicits one of the most powerful passages in Desert Solitaire. Here, Abbey identifies with the vulture, as he did not with the gopher snakes, and with that identification comes a powerful- perhaps all the more powerful as we read it now after Edward Abbey's death- vision of his own place, and humankind's place, as part of a larger whole: Southwest, toward Grandview Point and The Maze, I can see V- shaped black wings in the lonely sky, soaring higher and higher against a yellow sunset. I think of the dead man under the ju- niper on the edge of the world, seeing him as the vulture would have seen him, far below and from a great distance. And 1 see myself through those cruel eyes. I feel myself sinking into the landscape, fixed in place like a stone, like a tree, a small motion- less shape of vague outline, desert-colored, and with the wings of imagination look down at myself through the eyes of the bird, watching a human figure that becomes smaller, smaller in the receding landscape as the bird rises into the evening- a man at a table near a twinkling campfire, surrounded by a rolling wasteland of stone and dune and sandstone monuments, the wasteland surrounded by dark canyons and the course of rivers and mountain ranges on a vast plateau stretching across Col- orado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona, and beyond this plateau more deserts and greater mountains, the Rockies in dusk, the Sierra Nevadas shining in their late after-noon, and farther and farther yet, the darkened East, the gleaming Pacific, the curving margins of the great earth itself, and beyond earth that ultimate world of sun and stars whose bounds we cannot discover. (243- 44) Within Abbey's book, as within his life, this epiphany is clearly hard won.3 In the midst of growing concerns about our role in the natural world, this passage and the whole of Desert Solitaire speak to us with force, eloquence, and complexity, illustrating some of the possibilities available in our efforts to include environmental literature in the English curriculum. 41</page><page sequence="8">Critic 54:1 Notes ^wo points that would take much fuller discussion to cover fully deserve mention here. One is that this biocentric emphasis need not necessarily be antihuman; it can be the way to achieve a larger, more connected humanity. A second, and related point, is that this biocentrism is never fully or purely realizable. The very act of communicating biocentric beliefs involves the act of writing and thus a necessary degree of anthropomorphism; the nature writing self thus can move away from totally human-centered concerns and toward the expression of values that are more nearly ecocentric than egocentric, but that movement can never be total. The writer's apprehension and description of the nonhuman are, always, necessarily, to some degree human. 2 Edward Hoagland discusses Edward Abbey's life and his death in a memorial essay for the New York Times. Hoagland also juxtaposes Abbey's accomplishments with Oates's reductive dismissal of nature literature, but his emphasis is more generally on Abbey's life and the whole of his work. 3Ann Ronald compares this passage and its place in Abbey's work to a similar journal inscription by Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. This comparison is useful as long as we also acknowledge that Joyce is careful to have his novel's context undercut Stephen's overly egocentric vision. Abbey, on the other hand, uses his epiphany as a way to express ecocentric values, to emphasize humankind's place as a part of the natural world. Works Cited Abbey, Edward.
