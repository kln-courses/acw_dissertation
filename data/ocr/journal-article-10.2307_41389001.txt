<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lewis С. Seifert Animal-Human Hybridity in d'Aulnoy's "Babiole" and "Prince Wild Boar" It is hardly a revelation that animals are prominent in folk- and fairy tales. Ap- pearing as protagonists, helpers, or antagonists, the Ugly Duckling, Puss in Boots, and Little Red Riding Hood's wolf, among so many other animals, are central to what we understand these genres to be. But however commonplace, animals pose nothing short of an interpretive challenge, especially in the wake of emerging critical interest in what is called "animal studies."1 Most often, folk- and fairy-tale animals are presumed to have metaphorical meanings that exceed their existence as natural beings in a world shared with humans. That is, they are understood to be anthropomorphic or symbolic representations that have relatively little to do with animals per se and much more with humans. Of course, such interpretations have undeniable merit: in storytelling traditions the world over, fictional animals are made to figure human virtues, vices, foibles, and dilemmas, providing a mirror image all the more faithful because it reflects a purportedly nonhuman appearance.2 It would seem, then, that the an- imal disappears before the human. But this never entirely happens, I would argue, not only because folk- and fairy-tale animals almost always retain dis- tinctive traits of their nonhuman beings (e.g., the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood has the infamous coat of hair and big ears, eyes, and teeth in addition to the ability to reason and speak as a man), but also because animals - no matter how anthropomorphic - always pose an existential problem for humans. As Other, animals enable humans in fairy tales to define themselves by both comparison and contrast. The wolf may personify a male seducer (or any number of other Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 25, No. 2 (2011), pp. 244-260.

This emergent field is motivated by both eco- logical and philosophical concerns. On the one hand, it is a response to envi- ronmental degradation and its consequences for all animal life, nonhuman and human. On the other (but the two are certainly linked), this field is an exten- sion of the postmodern critique of the (human) subject, exposing the myth of self-knowledge and self-mastery elaborated by Enlightenment rationalism by underscoring how human and nonhuman animals all share an "embodied fini- tude" (Wolfe 570). In short, animal studies is a response to the prevailing as- sumption in our modern and postmodern world that humans are apart from and above nonhuman beings; that we are radically different from them; that humans possess reason, language, and any number of other traits unknown to nonhuman animals. By blurring the boundaries between human and animal, this field aims to redefine our ethical responsibility not only toward animals but also toward other humans. What we assume about animals and humans, how we speak about them, and how we act toward them are all concerned by critical work that puts animals in new light. Ethical questions like these are also at the heart of folk- and fairy tales, of course. Indeed, the fact that questions about how humans should think of, speak about, and act toward animals recur so often in these genres underscores their relevance for the new critical interest in animals and animality. Over and beyond the cultural and symbolic significance long noted by anthropologists and folklorists, folk- and fairy-tale animals reveal a wide range of perspectives on relations between humans and nonhumans, especially because of the often unique representation given to animals. More often than not, animals are char- acters in their own right and are given supernatural or nonempirical traits, all the while retaining characteristics that identify them as such (e.g., appearance or behavior). But one of the most significant ways folk- and fairy tales broach the representation of animals and animality is through the frequent motif of metamorphosis (animal to human, human to animal, etc.), which puts into re- lief the divide - or lack thereof - between the human and the nonhuman. With the transformation of humans into animals and vice versa, tales of meta- morphosis necessarily delineate what it means to be human and nonhuman through the experience of hybridity, whereby a character finds himself or herself between species. The late seventeenth-century conteuse Marie-Catherine d'Aulnoy (1650?- 1705) offers striking examples of fairy-tale animals and animal metamorphosis. Compared to the other writers of literary fairy tales of her day (and arguably of 245</page><page sequence="3">LEWIS С. SEIFERT all periods), d'Aulnoy features the widest ranging menagerie of animals, with no fewer than 124 different types (Verdier 172-76). The conteuse puts her crea- tures to many different uses: as rhetorical figures, comparing human characters to nonhumans; as symbols, evoking traditional meanings of various animals; and of course as characters, both helpers and protagonists.3 But the full extent of her fascination with animal life is most apparent in her tales of animal meta- morphosis, which account for twelve of her twenty-five tales.4 Critics have often asserted that the hybrid beings in these stories are little more than hu- mans with an animal appearance - in sum, that animal metamorphosis is a trope by means of which the nonhuman effectively disappears.5 That is, if ani- mal metamorphosis is primarily or even exclusively a metaphor or an allegory, for instance, then the transformation of a human into an animal is a psycholog- ical or moral quest in which the animal likeness has little or nothing to say about nonhuman existence or the relation between the animal and the human. Now, it is certainly true that all of d'Aulnoy's tales of metamorphosis encourage an allegorical meaning of some sort, be it through the final moral, intercalated maxims, or some other means. But even as d'Aulnoy uses metamorphosis to re- flect on human ethics and psychology, she also draws attention to the nonhu- man dimension of her hybrid characters. This is especially evident in "Babiole" and "Prince Wild Boar," where more than in any of her other tales the focus is put on the tensions between human and nonhuman animality. In these two sto- ries, which I discuss here, d'Aulnoy engages, albeit obliquely, with the debates about the distinction between the human and the nonhuman that marked her day. Rather than give a straightforward answer, the conteuse unsettles any certainty about exactly what boundaries separate humans from animals. The Animal-Machine, Rationality, and Metamorphosis In d'Aulnoy's day there was less of a consensus about the animal-human divide than exists today. To be sure, René Descartes's notion of the animal-machine, which likened animals to mechanical objects devoid of thought, language, and feeling, had begun to attract proponents and later would become the basis for a widely shared consensus about the exceptionality of the human subject (Fudge 148ff). But even in late seventeenth-century France, when the conteuse was writing her fairy tales, many people, especially in "wordly" settings, con- tinued to resist the Cartesian paradigm, holding to the more fluid pre-Cartesian conceptions of animality (Boas 118-55). Before (and even after) Descartes's animal-machine, human beings were understood to exist within a cosmological spectrum that extended from the angels to animals. As Laurie Shannon has put it, "early modern humanity is relatively ecosystemic: it always has animality (and divinity and plants and elements) in or with it" (477). Although reason 246</page><page sequence="4">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN D'AULNOY was broadly taken to distinguish humans from animals in this period, it was not categorically denied to animals, at least not before the invention of the animal-machine. Synthesizing a line of thought going back to Plutarch and others, Michel de Montaigne, for instance, refuses to deny animals the capac- ity to reason and, even more, to use this criterion to distinguish them from humans.6 The revival of skepticism in early modern thought emphasized the limits of human reason to discern what animals may know while entertaining the possibility of animal superiority (Fudge 84-122). More generally, however, pre-Cartesian ethics understood humanity to be variable and mutable with respect to animality. Reason had to be applied in order to make the human being truly human, since only with this capacity could the pull of the body be resisted, something animals were supposedly incapable of doing. Still, within this framework, humans' reason was not always able to overcome the body, and when that happened they were in fact inferior to animals (because they were incapable of using the very facility that set them apart) (60). With Descartes's animal-machine, though, problems like this were set aside: the human subject was perceived to be autonomous and wholly unlike other living (nonhuman) beings, who no longer served as a relevant point of comparison for what humans could (not) or should (not) be.7 And yet the sort of comparison that Descartes's animal-machine purport- edly made obsolete is the very stuff of metamorphosis tales such as d'Aulnoy's. Unlike the independence presupposed by that notion, this category of tales emphasizes the dependence of humans upon animals, since the enchanted protagonist must endure her or his nonhuman being in order to become fully human. In fact, if metamorphosis is defined, as Francisco Vaz da Silva has pro- posed, as a "reversible transition between contrasted aspects of the same being, entailing opposites as alternating aspects of unitary entities" (6), then the animal and the human could coexist even after the final disenchantment. No matter how "opposite" the enchanted animal form may seem to be, then, it is always already an integral part of the disenchanted human form. For da Silva, the "contrasted aspects" of the "unitary" enchanted being are symbolic such that the animal guise means something other than a literal animal. And as I have already stated, such readings are often explicitly encouraged by writers of fairy tales, including d'Aulnoy. But in "Babiole" and "Prince Wild Boar," the conteuse suggests other ways of viewing animal metamorphosis that, in addi- tion to allegorical meanings, highlight the uncertain distinction between the human and the nonhuman. By exploiting the alternating duality fundamental to metamorphosis and underscoring its literal as well as its figurative mean- ings, d'Aulnoy, I argue here, resists the Cartesian attempt to foreclose the human subject from (nonhuman) animality. More than any of her other metamorphosis tales, "Babiole" and "Prince 247</page><page sequence="5">LEWIS С. SEIFERT Wild Boar" insistently blur such boundaries until the final disenchantment. Unlike the heroes and heroines in d'Aulnoy's other tales of metamorphosis, the protagonists in these two stories are transformed at infancy, and the narratives describe how they are trained to become as human as their animal bodies will permit. Quickly it becomes apparent that they are endowed with esprit (intel- ligence) and able to speak, astonishing those around them because in most other ways Babiole and Marcassin are unmistakably nonhuman. Indeed, their bodies are more than an outward shell; they make them into truly hybrid be- ings. If they reason and speak as humans do, they also display the instinctual tastes and urges issuing from their animal selves. In this sense they are not un- like the hybrid creatures in La Fontaine's fables, which d'Aulnoy references ex- tensively throughout her fairy tales.8 But in addition to other differences with La Fontaine's animals, Babiole's and Marcassin's hybridity takes on a psycho- logical dimension generally unexplored by the fabulist. Both of d'Aulnoy's pro- tagonists are acutely aware of their state and suffer great distress at their lack of full-fledged humanity - so much so, in fact, that they both retreat to their nat- ural habitats when the constraints of human society overwhelm them. In each case these constraints become unbearable while they pursue their unsuitable (because human) marriage partners. In these moments d'Aulnoy focuses atten- tion once again on hybridity before proceeding to the final disenchantment.9 In studies of metamorphosis tales, critics have concentrated overwhelmingly on the sexual and gendered implications of the encounter between animal brides or grooms and their human partners.10 Without discounting the impor- tance of this focus, my interest here is to reflect on how the protagonists' struggle with nonhuman animality is represented and resolved in each tale. "Babiole": From Hybridity to Courtly Humanity Babiole's existence is every bit as tumultuous as the story that bears her name. This princess is transformed into a monkey at birth when her mother, a queen, is tricked by the vindictive fairy Fanfreluche into putting a hawthorn flower on her forehead. The princess is ordered drowned by her mother, only to be res- cued by her aunt, the rival queen of a neighboring kingdom, who immediately adopts her as a pet and gives her the name Babiole (meaning "trinket" or "tri- fle"). The princess astonishes members of the court with her ability to reason and speak. Dressed as a human girl, she becomes something of a circus animal, amusing visitors from far and wide. Babiole, however, is not content to play this role and is distraught when her affection for her cousin, the prince, is un- requited, and even more so when her aunt decides to marry her off to Magot, the king of monkeys. After escaping from his kingdom, she is assisted by the aquatic divinity Biroqua, only to be taken prisoner by her mother, who soon 248</page><page sequence="6">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN D'AULNOY discovers her identity. Once again Babiole escapes, this time to a desert where magic objects given by Biroqua allow her to recover her human form, which attracts the attention of none other than her cousin. When he is gravely wounded in a tournament, the princess, assuming he has died, is despondent and wanders aimlessly until she is taken captive by Fanfreluche, who impris- ons her one last time. Aided by Biroqua, her cousin the prince, on a flying dol- phin, rescues her and obtains her hand in marriage from his aunt, Babiole's mother.11 "Babiole" is structured around a double-entendre inherent in the words guenon and guenuche, which mean both "female monkey" and "ugly woman." As a result, throughout this tale, the heroine's adventures can be read as those of a literal monkey and an ugly woman, something the narrator delights in making clear through many humorous asides. For instance, Babiole's dislike of the (human) food prescribed by her aunt's doctor is attributed to the fact that "elle était volonatire comme une guenuche née princesse," meaning "she was as stubborn as a monkey/ugly woman born as a princess would be" (Aulnoy, "Babiole" 5 10). 12 In this example, as in others, the humor is intensified by the double-entendre. Here and in the many other instances of humor directed at the enchanted beings in d'Aulnoy's tales of metamorphosis, emphasis is put squarely on the uncertainty and ambivalence of hybridity, in addition to its in- congruity. When Babiole begins to speak, the narrator uses free indirect dis- course to poke fun at the courtiers' reactions: "Quelle merveille! Babiole par- lante, Babiole raisonnante!" (What a wonder! Babiole is speaking, Babiole is thinking! 510), reactions all the more humorous since they come right after a telling physical description of Babiole where it is noted that "la vivacité de ses yeux marquait tant d'esprit, que l'on n'avait pas lieu de s'étonner de tout ce qu'on lui voyait faire" (her lively eyes showed so much intelligence that people should not have been astonished at all they saw her do; 509). The courtiers could be forgiven for being surprised at Babiole's linguistic and cognitive abili- ties; after all, language and reasoning were two of the primary traits that sup- posedly distinguished humans from nonhumans, according to many, includ- ing Descartes. And of course the courtiers are not privy to the foreknowledge of Babiole's human birth provided to readers, but this leads us back to the es- prit in her eyes. Is that "vivacité" (liveliness) the sign of her essential humanity (assuming intelligence is an exclusively human trait), or instead is it a capacity shared among all animals, humans and nonhumans alike? If we accept that Babiole is a girl in nothing more than the guise of a monkey, then the esprit vis- ible in her eyes is proof of her humanity But the narrative suggests otherwise at various points. When describing how she falls in love with her cousin, we are told that "Babiole avait un cœur, et ce cœur n'avait pas été métamorphosé comme le reste de sa petite personne: il prit donc de la tendresse pour le 249</page><page sequence="7">LEWIS С. SEIFERT prince, et il en prit si fort, qu'il en prit trop" (Babiole had a heart, and this heart had not been metamorphosed like the rest of her little person: it took a liking to the prince, and it took so much of one that it took too much of one; 511). If only her heart is human and the rest monkey, then is her mind that of a mon- key? Given the commonplace opposition between passions (the heart) and reason (the mind) in this time period, we might answer in the affirmative, even though this would imply cordoning off the passions of the heart from the rest of Babiole's (monkey) body - and of course her (monkey) mind. Even as Babiole's powers of reasoning grow, she still cannot escape the fact that she is a guenuche. Following received wisdom about monkeys at the time, she tries to break mirrors every time she sees her reflection, prompting people to quip: "Le singe est toujours singe, Babiole ne saurait se défaire de la malice naturelle à ceux de sa famille" (Monkeys are always monkeys, and Babiole can- not escape the maliciousness so natural to those of her family; 511). 13 No mat- ter how many human qualities Babiole may display, she is always, at bottom, nothing more than a guenuche, at least for the observers at court. Babiole her- self realizes that she is only partially a monkey, even though she has no way of knowing she has been enchanted. When her cousin the prince rejects her sug- gestion of marriage, she tells him: "Vous êtes heureux . . . queje n'aie pas tout à fait l'esprit d'une guenuche, une autre que moi vous aurait déjà crevé les yeux, mordu le nez, arraché les oreilles, mais je vous abandonne aux réflexions que vous ferez un jour sur votre indigne procédé" (You are fortunate . . . that my mind is not entirely a monkey's; any other monkey would have already poked your eyes out, bitten your nose, and pulled your ears off. But I just leave you to reflect someday on your unworthy conduct; 516). If she is a monkey when confronted with mirrors, she is a human in the presence of her beloved. In her reproach to her cousin, she is also singularly aware of having a mind that "is not entirely a monkey's," of being of two minds, so to speak. Fundamentally, however, she is certain that she is - or at least should be - something other than the monkey she is, and this certainty reaches a climax when, fleeing her mother, Babiole says to herself, "pensant et repensant mille fois à la bizarrerie d'une aventure si extraordinaire: 'Quelle différence ... de ce que je suis à ce que je devais être!"' (turning over in her mind again and again the bizarreness of such an extraordinary adventure: "What a difference there is . . . between what I am and what I was meant to be"; 523). Directly preced- ing her disenchantment, this moment makes the self-awareness of her human- ity the precondition for its emergence. When she regains her human form, she becomes the superlatively beautiful princess of fairy-tale norms and then watches in amazement as architects, painters, masons, tapestry makers, and sculptors design and build a magnificent palace in the middle of a hostile 250</page><page sequence="8">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN D'AULNOY wasteland, after which she is offered all manner of wealth and pleasure by princesses, squires, pages, and treasurers (523-24). Hybridity and animality dis- appear, humanity is (re)affirmed, and nature is tamed by culture - at least mo- mentarily, for the vengeful fairy Fanfreluche captures her and encloses her in a giant bottle, where "il y eut bien des jours où elle regretta sa peau de guenuche; elle vivait comme les caméléons, de l'air et de la rosée" (there were many days she wished she had her monkey skin; she lived as chameleons do, from air and dew; 527). Had she remained a guenuche, Fanfreluche would not have sought to punish her, she concludes; but this temporary setback does not signal a return to her former state. In regretting her enchantment, she contemplates not the hybrid existence she had known, with monkeylike mind and instincts, but rather its mere semblance; her life as a monkey has been reduced to a skin, and the resem- blance she bears to a chameleon is figurative, not literal. When the prince comes to rescue her, astride a flying dolphin and armed with weapons provided by many different sea creatures,14 he is mistaken by fish for the "god of soles."15 But his humanity is never in doubt; by using the sea animals to free Babiole, he exemplifies the hierarchical superiority of humans over animals. But perhaps the clearest sign that animal-human hybridity has been ban- ished from the story appears in the final versed moral, when the ambiguity of the word guenuche is resolved in favor of its figurative meaning: J'en connais bien encor dans le siècle où nous sommes, En qui d'une guenuche on trouve la laideur, Et qui pourtant des plus grands hommes Prétendent captiver le coeur; Mais il faudrait en leur faveur, Que quelque enchanteur charitable, Voulût bien leur donner, pour hâter leur bonheur, Ainsi qu'à Babiole, une forme agréable. (533) I know many women in our day, In whom one finds the ugliness of a monkey, And who nonetheless of the greatest men Claim to capture the hearts; But for their benefit some charitable enchanter Would have to be willing So as to hasten their good fortune, to give them, Just like Babiole, an attractive form. 251</page><page sequence="9">LEWIS С. SEIFERT These final verses of d'Aulnoy's moral concentrate on ugly (and delusional) women - not female monkeys - and Babiole becomes little more than a hu- morous point of comparison. Although its literal implications - narrative, psy- chological, and comic - are developed throughout the tale, animal-human hy- bridity in the end gives way to the familiar and reassuring figurality of allegory Unlike Babiole, the ugly women who claim to seduce "the greatest men" have no hope of becoming beautiful. But neither are they afflicted with the torment caused by interspecies ambiguity, because, the moral implies, it can only exist in a fairy tale. Thus, no matter how pessimistic, d'Aulnoy's message is also meant to be reassuring, because outside of fairy tales, humans and animals exist in a stable and hierarchical relationship with one another. "Prince Wild Boar," or Hierarchies Undone In "Prince Wild Boar" d'Aulnoy gives at once similar and different perspectives on animal-human hybridity. At the outset, as in "Babiole," a queen is the victim of a malicious fairy, but unlike that story, her infant is born not a human but instead a wild pig ( marcassin ). Instead of contemplating infanticide, as does Babiole's mother, Prince Marcassin's mother cherishes him in spite of his ap- pearance and attempts to raise him as an ordinary prince. From an early age, Marcassin, like Babiole, shows signs of an intelligence that exceeds what is ex- pected of an animal as he masters bodily and intellectual skills required of a noble at court. Like Babiole, he also directs his amorous attentions toward hu- mans rather than animals; and as with d'Aulnoy's monkey heroine, her pig hero suffers great psychological distress when his affections are not returned. But in a twist typical of d'Aulnoy's animal grooms (and untypical of her animal brides), Marcassin's sexual desire manifests itself as violent (purportedly ani- mal) aggression.16 When he pursues and marries Ismène against her will, she kills herself, along with her beloved. At first the prince is overcome with grief and deplores his animality, but eventually he consoles himself by marrying Is- mène's sister, Zélonide, whom he kills on their wedding bed after discovering her plot to murder him. Again beset with grief, Marcassin decides to flee court and instead live as a wild boar in the forest. There, he happens upon Marthésie, the youngest sister of Ismène and Zélonide, and Marthésie agrees to be his wife. One morning, after becoming pregnant, she discovers a pig skin. When her husband, now a human, appears, he attributes his initial animal form and subsequent transformation to three fairies, who then appear and res- urrect Ismène, her beloved, and Zélonide. The prince and his new bride return to court, and Marthésie gives birth not to a pig but to a beautiful baby boy. In this tale d'Aulnoy amplifies the motif of animal-human hybridity far beyond either her principal source, Giovan Francesco Straparola's tale (Night 252</page><page sequence="10">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN D'AULNOY 2, fable 1 of The Facetious Nights) or Henriette-Julie de Muraťs more or less contemporaneous The Pig King.17 Indeed, d'Aulnoy's hero occupies a middle ground between Straparola's and Murat's two heroes. Whereas Straparola's is more pig than human (e.g., the narrative focuses on his porcine instincts, par- ticularly his penchant for wallowing in dirt and mud), Murat's is far more human than pig (e.g., he is able to shed his pig skin and live as a human long before his final disenchantment). More than either of these two versions, d'Aulnoy's story concentrates heavily on the liminality of Prince Marcassin, most visibly with the choice of marcassin (young wild boar) over pore (pig), the term employed by Straparola and Murat. In Western culture pigs have long been seen as highly ambiguous animals in relation to humans. They are cast as the embodiment of typically human vices such as gluttony, greed, and sloven- liness, but at the same time they serve as symbols of the uncivilized, nonhu- man other.18 D'Aulnoy compounds this ambivalence by making her hero not a domesticated pig ( pore or eoehon ), but instead a wild boar ( marcassin ). As a prince, he is at the summit of court culture, itself the paragon of human civi- lization; but as a boar, he is also its antithesis, a wild, even dangerous, animal of the forest. Marcassin, then, is an oxymoronic figure, whose very being encompasses seemingly impossible opposites - in essence, a domesticated undomesticatable pig. The names used by the narrator and other characters to refer to the hero put a humorous light on his hybridity, all the while making it a central feature of his existence. He is most often simply "Marcassin," of course, but diminutives, articles, epithets, possessives, and varying upper/lowercase call attention to the ambivalence between animal and human evoked by his name: "Marcassinet" (Aulnoy, "Le Prince Marcassin" 968); "l'impatient Marcassin" (the impatient Young Boar, 971); "le Marcassin royal" (the royal Young Boar, 974); "le prince Marcassin" (Prince Young Boar, 976); "un Marcassin," "un marcassin" (979); "l'amoureux Marcassin" (the Young Boar in love, 976, 982); "ton/mon Mar- cassin" (your/my Young Boar, 978); "un Marcassin perdu" (a lost young Boar, 987); "seigneur Marcassin" (Lord Young Boar, 988); "le bon Marcassin" (the good Young Boar, 991, 992). To these are added occasional uses of sanglier (adult wild boar): le sanglier (972); le Sanglier (991, 992); leur fils Sanglier (their son the Boar, 983). And further emphasizing his ambivalence, Marcassin is even deri- sively called a "pig" ( cochon or pore ) at moments when his attitude or behavior is perceived as decidedly unhuman (983, 993). Along with the animal register, Marcassin is repeatedly - and tellingly - called a "monstre" (monster), which in the early modern period connoted not so much abnormality as extraordinary but wholly "natural" phenomena.19 When his mother calls him "un monstre dans la nature" (a monster of nature; 978), she laments his uncommon (i.e., ambivalent animal-human) existence, but inscribes 253</page><page sequence="11">LEWIS С SEIFERT it within the bounds of the "natural." Although "monstrous," Marcassin's animal and human natures are not incompatible at first. Instead, his boar body and in- stincts determine his human actions. Thus, when he is attracted to Ismène and begins courting her, "il lui donnait toutes les truffes que son instinct mar- cassinique lui faisait trouver dans la forêt" (he gave her all the truffles his boarish instinct made him find in the forest; 971). Still, no matter how much Marcassin is able to channel his "boarish instinct" into civilized human behavior, he cannot overcome the shame and anguish caused by his appearance. And even though "on n'oubliait rien pour le rendre propre et poli" (nothing was spared to make him clean and polite; 969), including clothes that hide some of his animal fea- tures, "il ressentait bien amèrement le ridicule de sa figure marcassinique; de sorte qu'il évitait de paraître aux grandes assemblées" (he saw with great bitter- ness how ridiculous his boarish figure was, and so he avoided appearing in large crowds; 969). But "great bitterness" is not all he feels when confronted with his "boarish figure." In each of his three courtships, Marcassin is torn between conflicting im- pulses, at moments acutely aware of his nonhuman body, even showing empa- thy for the disgust he inspires in Ismène, Zélonide, and Marthésie, but at others unable to control his desires. For much of the tale, the prince alternates between reason and passion, a familiar topos of literature in the period. But rather than solely associating reason with humanity and passion with animality, a common- place opposition, d'Aulnoy instead complicates matters, just as she does in "Babiole". Marcassin's acute consciousness of his boar self distances him from humanity and gives him a unique position from which to critique it. After dis- covering Zélonide's plot to kill him on their wedding bed, he reflects to himself: Que lui ai-je fait pour l'obliger à me vouloir tuer? Il est vrai que je ne suis pas beau, que je mange malproprement, que j'ai quelques dé- fauts: mais qui n'en a pas? Je suis homme sous la figure d'une bête. Combien y a-t-il de bêtes sous la figure d'un homme? Cette Zélonide que je trouvais si charmante, n'est-elle pas elle-même une tigresse et une lionne? (984) What did I do to her to make her want to kill me? It's true I'm not handsome, I eat in a slovenly way, and I have a few faults. But who doesn't? I'm a man in the guise of a beast. How many beasts are there in the guise of a man? This Zélonide I found so charming, isn't she a tigress and a lioness? In his condemnation of Zélonide and others of her ilk, Marcassin invokes a commonplace metaphorical comparison of humans to animals, but he does so while assuming the position of an animal who is (also) human.20 In so doing, 254</page><page sequence="12">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN DAULNOY he puts a new twist on the animal metaphor: in addition to warning humans about the danger of falling into (metaphorical) animality, he sets himself apart as a human who literally is an animal but who is conscious of being so, unlike Zélonide. Because of his self-awareness, the animal-human hybrid escapes the metaphorical assimilation of humans who are unaware of their resemblance to animals. Marcassin is not and cannot be the metaphorical animal that non- hybrid humans risk becoming. Even more, Marcassin's awareness of his hy- bridity provides an ironic counterpoint to the way literal animality is effaced in early modern moral discourse.21 It is as if, the tale suggests, only "a human in the guise of an animal" can truly deploy this trope, as if only a being who is at once animal and human can compare the two. But in the end Marcassin's hybridity makes life at court untenable for him. After discovering Zélonide's plot and killing her, he decides to abandon the court for the depths of the forest, where, he explains: J'irai . . . mener la vie qui convient à un sanglier de bien et d'honneur. Je ne ferai plus l'homme galant. Je ne trouverai point d'animaux qui me reprochent d'être plus laid qu'eux. Il me sera aisé d'être leur roi, car j'ai la raison en partage, qui me fera trouver le moyen de les maîtriser. Je vivrai plus tranquillement avec eux que je ne vis dans une Cour destinée à m'obéir, et je n'aurai point le malheur d'épouser une laie qui se poignarde, ou qui me veuille étrangler. (985) I will . . . lead a life fitting for an upright and honorable boar. No longer will I pretend to be a gallant man. I won't find any animals who reproach me for being uglier than they are. It'll be easy for me to be their king, for I have the gift of reason which will allow me to find the way to master them. I'll live in more tranquility with them than I live at a court destined to obey me, and I'll not have the misfortune of marrying a sow who stabs herself, or one who wants to strangle me. In the forest, despite his desire to live as "an upright and honorable boar," Mar- cassin remains a hybrid being - and intentionally so - thanks to his (human) reason: unable to reign among humans, he is king of the animals, for whom his nonhuman appearance is not an obstacle. And yet, precisely because he has the capacity to reason, he is able to learn from animals a lesson that will allow him to return to human society. When he encounters Marthésie in the forest, he tells her: J'ai appris, depuis que je suis habitant de ces forêts, que rien au monde ne doit être plus libre que le cœur; je vois que tous les ani- maux sont heureux, parce qu'ils ne se contraignent point. Je ne savais 255</page><page sequence="13">LEWIS С. SEIFERT pas alors leurs maximes, je les sais à présent, et je sens bien que je préférerais la mort à un hymen forcé. (987) While living in these forests, I've learned that nothing in the world should be freer than the heart. I see that all the animals are happy be- cause they do not force each other to do things. Back then I didn't know their maxims; but I know them now, and I am convinced that I would prefer death to a forced marriage. The animal maxims Marcassin evokes are part of his courtship ritual (to reas- sure Marthésie her fate will not resemble that of her sisters) and, as such, might be discounted as the insincere sweet talk of a male lover, especially since he later goes against his word and imprisons Marthésie until she finally con- sents to marry him. But in spite of his momentary lapse, Marcassin's third mar- riage - and indeed the underlying logic of this fairy tale - upholds the animals' maxim about the necessary freedom of the heart. When Marthésie agrees to wed the boar - willingly and graciously, it should be noted (990-92) - she, too, plays her part in applying animal wisdom to achieve (human) happiness. And besides paving the way for Marcassin to receive his human body, their marriage illustrates a point made by early seventeenth-century theriophilists - namely, that humans are wiser when they follow animal instinct rather than their own learned reasoning (Boas 59-60). Before accepting to marry Marcassin, Marthésie forces him to resolve the ambivalence of his hybrid state. After she protests being held captive, Marcassin attributes his misdeed to his humanity: Il faut bien, lui dit-il en souriant à la marcassine, qu'il y ait un peu de l'homme mêlé avec le sanglier. Ce défaut de parole que vous me re- prochez, cette petite finesse où je ménage mes intérêts, c'est juste- ment l'homme qui agit; car à vous parler sans façon, les animaux ont plus d'honneur entre eux que les hommes. (990) "There is necessarily a bit of the man mixed in with the boar," he said smiling in a boarish way. "This untrustworthiness you reproach me with, this shrewdness with which I get my way, that's precisely the man acting; for, to tell you plainly, animals are more honorable amongst themselves than are men." But the obstacle for Marthésie is not his human vice as much as his dual na- ture: "vous avez le mauvais de l'un et de l'autre: le coeur d'un homme et la fig- ure d'une bête; soyez donc tout un ou tout autre, après cela je me résoudrai à ce que vous souhaitez" (you have the bad of each one: the heart of a man and the figure of a beast. So be entirely one or the other and then I will agree to 256</page><page sequence="14">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN D'AULNOY what you wish; 990). Of course, Marthésie ends up agreeing to stay with Mar- cassin even before he has become entirely human, as indeed she must in the classic animal-groom tale. Still, her ultimatum signals once again an unsettling of the hierarchy of relations between animals and humans. Seemingly content to live with either a virtuous boar or a duplicitous human, Marthésie - and by extension the tale - puts animals and humans on a more or less equal footing, so long as they are independent of one another. Of course, when Marcassin is finally disenchanted and becomes "le plus aimable de tous les hommes" (the most handsome of all men; 993), Marthésie's joy is predictable. But several aspects of the tale's conclusion are less so and put into question what is ostensibly the triumph of the human over the animal. It is curious, first of all, that Marcassin returns to court after his devastating critiques of its vices (980-81, 982). Are we to assume that insincerity, flattery, and vi- ciousness will disappear now that he is fully human? Or, since he is no longer a hybrid being, will such vices no longer torment him? To these unresolved ques- tions is added yet another that arises from a curious explanation given to Mar- cassin upon his disenchantment. When he is astonished to see Ismène; her fi- ancé, Corydon; and Zélonide resurrected, the fairies respond: "La règle n'est pas toujours générale . . . mais il est indubitable que l'on doit suspendre son juge- ment sur bien des choses, et penser qu'il peut entrer quelque dose de féerie dans ce qui nous paraît de plus certain" (The rule isn't always true . . . but it's unquestionable that we must suspend our judgment about many things and realize that a bit of fairy magic can be at work in things that seem to be most cer- tain to us; 996). When applied to Marcassin's disenchantment, this rule - with a notable but unspecified exception - is perplexing indeed. If appearances are deceiving, what of his disenchantment? Has his hybridity really been dissolved, or does the fairies' exception cover this possibility? More generally, are we to conclude that animal appearances are not always animal essence and, contrari- wise, that human appearances are not always human essence? If so, can there ever be a clear divide between humans and animals? The uncertainty surrounding these questions perpetuates the ambiguity of Marcassin's hybrid state at the very moment when it should disappear in the animal-groom tale ending. "Prince Wild Boar" eschews the assertion of human superiority found at the end of "Babiole," in a shift from predictability and cer- tainty to unpredictability and uncertainty. And thus it invites readers to question the existence of a stable boundary between the human and the non- human, such as that erected by Descartes's animal-machine. More fundamen- tally, though, "Prince Wild Boar" explores what might be gained from a hybrid subjectivity in which human reason is conjoined with animal instinct and human vice is counterbalanced by animal virtue. The unresolved questions at the end of the tale suggest that its happy ending is not predicated on the 257</page><page sequence="15">LEWIS С. SEIFERT dissolution of Marcassin's animality, but rather on its persistence alongside his humanity. Through this penultimate conte de fées of her corpus - and its depar- ture from her other animal-bride and animal-groom tales, d'Aulnoy shows how fairy-tale metamorphosis can unsettle received wisdom about what it means to be human in a world shared with animals.

In the long run, this Cartesian conception of human exceptionalism had signifi- cant repercussions for literary characterization, with the rise of what Bruce Boehrer terms "a sense of personal identity as singular and doubtful, consisting in particularity and observation, privileging mind over body and interior over exterior" (546). 8. In addition to allusions to La Fontaine and his fables, dAulnoy imitates or recy- cles the fabulist's lexemes and neologisms, especially with regard to animals. See Jasmin 176-82. 9. Among other critics, Defrance, Jasmin, and Robert emphasize the comic and erotic overtones afforded by d'Aulnoy's use of animal metamorphosis, especially in "Prince Wild Boar." See Defrance 120-25; Jasmin 330-34; and Robert 138. 10. The same holds true for criticism on d'Aulnoy's metamorphosis tales. See Defrance, Jasmin, Robert, and Slater. 11.

Monkeys were commonly thought to be irascible in this period, even though they were kept as pets at court. They were also said to become enraged when they saw themselves reflected in mirrors. Several of La Fontaine's fables depict angry mon- keys (see, for instance, "Le Singe," 12: xix). 14. He has a breastplate of golden carp scales, a giant snail shell with a decorative cod tail for a helmet, an eel as a belt, a fishbone sword, and a large tortoise shell as a shield (Aulnoy, "Babiole" 531). With the exception of the eel, the sea animals have obviously been killed to create the prince's arms and armor, thus demon- strating the prince's (human) mastery over them. 258</page><page sequence="16">ANIMAL-HUMAN HYBRIDITY IN D'AULNOY 15.

Indeed, this tale should be read as a commentary on the aggression of male de- sire. See, among others, Defrance 120-25. 17. Although a corresponding tale type has been identified by scholars (ATU 433), in all likelihood ď Aulnoy and Murat rewrote Straparola's tale instead. See Robert 132 and Delarue and Tenèze 2: 117-18. Straparola's version of this tale appeared in Facetious Nights (1550-1553) and was repeatedly published in French transla- tion beginning in 1585.
