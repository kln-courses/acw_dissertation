<plain_text><page sequence="1">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State Arthur Selwyn Miller It is with a certain wariness that I, an academic lawyer, stray into a den of economists. Not that law and economics are not closely allied; quite the contrary. As Justice Brandeis once said, a lawyer who knows no economics is a menace to his client. There are those, not all of whom are dead, who maintain that law, by and large, is a reflection of the economic interests of a given society. Perhaps I wish social and behav- ioral scientists recognized the need for knowing something about law, which, in my limited experience, they do not. Many economists, political scientists, and sociologists, to say nothing of newspaper columnists and assorted other pundits, habitually talk about law and legal institutions as if they were expert in the esoterica of and about law. One need not, as William of Occam might have said, needlessly multiply examples of this phenomenon. As this is written, I have before me clippings of two brief New York Times pieces by Milton Friedman on morality and controls, in which that learned economist discourses not only on the morality of Phase II of the new Nixonomics, but also on its impact on the rule of law. One would be temerarious indeed to impugn the learning of such an outstanding exponent of that exact science called economics; but, although I find some of what Friedman says makes sense, there is much that verges on pure nonsense. My purpose here is neither to bury nor to praise Milton Friedman; his name is invoked only to show that we in the law are often prey to the intellectual incursions of others. Another example will suffice to show what I mean. We all The author is Professor of Law, National Law Center, George Washington University, Washington, D. C.

Miller remember John R. Commons's half-century-old classic, Legal Founda- tions of Capitalism. It is a classic not only because it is difficult to read -you will recall, I trust, the notion that in order to be profound one must be obscure (or to put it another way, if one writes racily he is put down as being journalistic or, what is worse, Galbraithian)-but also because Commons did have considerable insight into the constitutional order and the role of the Supreme Court vis-d-vis the economy. To speak of John Kenneth Galbraith is to think of The New In- dustrial State, the book that first articulated a full-fledged conception of the corporate state, American style. That term, the corporate state, has become so current that it is now fashionable; people use it as if it had some accepted core of meaning, which, emphatically, it does not. Charles Reich of the Yale Law School, a law professor who thinks that wearing beads and bell-bottomed trousers is going to liberate all of us and bring us into some sort of terrestrial Nirvana, wrote in The Green- ing of America that this nation is indeed a corporate state. In so doing, he drew upon the existing literature, to the extent there was any, but with little attribution. He did not burden his exposition with the imped- imenta of footnotes, which had the merit of making his book more readable. To some, perhaps it made him original. Galbraith and Reich share one thing in common: In no place do they set out any workable definition of the corporate state that they perceive in the United States. They merely say that it exists, and we are left to glean from their prose what a corporate state is. A political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, H. L. Nieburg, suffers from the same malady-a failure to define terms or to construct a theoretical frame- work for thinking about a politico-economic situation. All three discuss the phenomenon and assume that their readers will agree with them. It would be easier if they helped us along with the elementary need of providing an adequate conceptual schema. In this paper, I should like to essay a few tentative thoughts along that line. The subject matter is vast and complex, and there is much that is not known, or at least that can be validated empirically. If, as Ernest Nagel has told us, there is no simple and at the same time adequate explanation of any social phenomenon, so too there is no way to simplify the complexity of American corporativism. It seems to me that a proper definition of the American version of the corporate state, when devel- oped, will have to encompass at least the following: (1) evidence that some sort of merger, actual or tacit, has taken place between political and economic power; (2) a legal nexus between the two; (3) a con- sequence of some type of corporate body that both encompasses the two and is greater than the arithmetical sum of the two; and (4) a diminution</page><page sequence="3">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 61 of the social and legal role of the individual qua individual. In short, the corporate state, to borrow a term from Otto von Gierke, is a type of group-person; perhaps it is the ultimate group-person in any given social order. You will note, I am confident, that I have used the term power as if it, too, had some commonly accepted meaning. That it does not, or even if it does that it is exceedingly difficult to identify the actors and their various roles in the American polity, is one of the teachings of those few political scientists, such as Harold Lasswell and Robert Dahl, who have contributed to our understanding of that concept. As used here, power means the ability or capacity to make or influence decisions of national importance. That of course does not exhaust all there is in the concept, but for present purposes I find it sufficient. The Context It is well to begin with a page of history, which is worth, so Justice Holmes told us, "a volume of logic"; in this instance it is worth a peck of empirical data. One need not dwell upon the way in which corpo- rations waxed in number and size from the beginnings of the Republic to the present time, so much so that we now have in existence an in- situation that is sui generis: the modern giant corporation. I do not mean to imply that corporate gigantism is the sole manifestation of the Ameri- can version of the corporate state, although surely it is among the most important contributing causes to that development. Nor need one restate the many obvious subventions in favor of business enterprise that were the norm of the nineteenth century and that, as we all know, continue to the present day. Economic historians have traced that path and marked it clearly. What I should like to emphasize is that law and the legal system were employed by the business community during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to further its interests. The word employ is not used invidiously; there have been and are examples of venality and corruption in legislatures, courts, and administrators, but the situation is far more subtle and far more entrenched than instances of out-and-out criminality. To put the point in other terms, there has always been a fairly close relationship between business and government, much more so than those who perpetuate myths, such as Supreme Court justices and corpo- rate executives, have been willing to admit. As expressed by a lawyer, we may agree with Eugene V. Rostow that "the line between public and private action is blurred, and always has been blurred, in American law." Or, as economist William Letwin has said:</page><page sequence="4">62 Arthur S. Miller The path that economic policy follows in its historical development is sinuous and obscure. To trace all its convolutions is an immensely difficult task. Faced with it, historians fall back, as they must, on simplifying notions. Instead of mapping all the meanderings of the real path, scholars try to match it, however roughly, with ready-made patterns. The professional tool-kit of economists and historians contain a few basic patterns that are thought to be general- ly useful for dealing with economic policy. They bear such names as laissez-faire, socialism, mercantilism, communism, and welfare state. Letwin might well have added that quite often commentators use these terms as if they had a commonly accepted meaning, which, most as- suredly, they do not. A basic pattern suggested here is this: The corporate state, if it exists, did not spring full-grown like Aphrodite; it is the culmination of trends that may be traced throughout American history. Trend analysis is useful in our understanding. It does not unduly distort words to maintain that some form of corporativism always has existed in this country, the difference between the past and present being one of degree rather than of type. Social phenomena are not to be understood as anything other than a product of history -a truism, to be sure, but a fact not sufficiently emphasized in the literature. With that in mind, permit me to separate from the chaff of history a few kernels for your consideration. The scrutiny is upon the law, both private and public. I take as my text a notion of Franz Neumann's: The significance of political power should be squarely faced. No society in recorded history has ever been able to dispense with political power. This is as true of liberalism as of absolutism, as true of laissez faire as of an interventionist state. No greater disservice has been rendered to political science than the statement that the liberal state was a "weak" state. It was precisely as strong as it needed to be in the circumstances. [Emphasis added.] Private Law Private law, for example, in torts, was judge-made for the most part. Rules of contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow- servant doctrine all permitted the burgeoning corporations during the nineteenth century to escape much of the human costs of industrial development. In the area of contract law, which, as we will see, merges into public law, the historical notion of Sir Henry Maine that the move- ment of progressive societies was from status to contract was written into legal doctrine. This meant that the economic power of the corpo- ration was said to be equal to, but no more than, the economic power of the workingman, an obvious fiction, to be sure, but followed by the courts and helpful to the corporations. Put another way, the lawmaking</page><page sequence="5">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 63 capacity of public government was placed at the disposal of the private governments of American enterprise. That notion of contract, by the way, still is followed to this day in, for example, the books used for law school study of the subject. Of even more importance were and are the contracts of adhesion, considered in law to be no different from a true arms-length transaction. Contracts of adhesion are legislative prescriptions by the private govern- ments of industry and trade associations. Political power (mainly the courts, but at times the legislatures) was used to permit economic power (the corporations) to prescribe the terms and conditions of most of those transactions called contracts. We see, then, the beginnings of that merg- er between the two types of power that is the first criterion of my developing definition. The merger was articulated, and this is important, in terms of liberty or freedom of contract, the legal analogue of a laissez-faire economic system. (That is an early indication of the difference between the "law in books" and the "law in action"; or perhaps better, between myth and reality. We will return to this, for it is central to my theme.) The social basis for freedom of contract was never valid, although it surely was more so than at present. The law, in its magnificent majesty, told the rich as well as the poor that they were free to contract; no recognition was given to something known by, I believe, Alexander Hamilton: "Necessitous men are not free men." The law, furthermore, was quick to protect property rights of the business class, again through the courts, even though, to my knowledge, no court has ever held that there is a property right in a job. The result was that both common-law courts and courts of equity provided a means by which ,he new corporations that began to come into existence about 1850 received basic protection. My final point about private law is taken from corporation law. Cor- porations were franchised by government for limited purposes and limit- ed times; it is only within the last century that the notion of immortality has attached to them. Henry Carter Adams, in his presidential address to the American Economic Association in 1896, entitled "Economics and Jurisprudence," said: Corporations originally were regarded as agencies of the state. They were created for the purpose of enabling the public to realize some social or national end without involving the necessity of direct gov- ernmental administration. They were in reality arms of the state, and in order to secure efficient management, a local or private interest was created as a privilege or property of the corporation. A corpo- ration, therefore, may be defined in the light of history as a body created by law for the purpose of attaining public ends through an appeal to private interests.</page><page sequence="6">64 Arthur S. Miller Adams, of course, merely called attention to an historical fact, but a fact that had been and has been clouded by a myth. That myth, in brief, was this: The corporation is merely a person, no more and no less than you or I; it exists, as do you and I, to maximize its economic interests (make profits for its owners); it is economic man writ large. That bit of intellectual hocus-pocus, pandered by lawyers and econo- mists, is on its way out. The businessman himself is coming to perceive that the it of a corporation is really a they, a collectivity rather than a monolithic entity, and that that form of private collectivism has respon- sibilities transcending the profit motive. Witness, for example, the recent statement of a so-called establishment business organization, the Com- mittee for Economic Development. In relations with their constituencies and with the larger society, American corporations operate today in an intricate matrix of obliga- tions and responsibilities that far exceed in scope and complexity those of most other institutions and are analogous in many respects to government itself. The great growth of corporations in size, mar- ket power, and impact on society has naturally brought with it a commensurate growth in responsibilities; in a democratic society, power sooner or later begets equivalent responsibility. That seems to be a latter-day restatement of Adams, based, however, on the social fact that corporations having waxed large and strong now have to recognize that with power comes social responsibility. It is the corpo- rations that say they serve the state, or, perhaps better in this age of egalitarianism, the people. Much of the committee's statement, in my judgment, cannot be faulted. I do have serious problems with the notion that America is a democratic society, either in the sense of widespread participation in decision making, or in Neumann's sense of "politically responsible decisions." We are elitist in our decision making, as Grant McConnell has pointed out. Furthermore, those who have power are not necessarily responsible or accountable, if I may use those two terms as being roughly synonymous. So much for private law. I hope that what has been said is sufficient at least to suggest the need to look beyond the fagade of law and the legal system to determine who benefits, and how, from that system. If politics, as Harold Lasswell has said, is a question of who gets what, where, when, and how, then judge-made private law-ostensibly normatively neutral and a product of a jurisprudential cosmology, attributed to Blackstone, that spoke in terms of eternal verities entirely divorced from the muck and mire of ordinary human affairs-historically helped to settle a number of those questions. In sum, it helped the corporations;</page><page sequence="7">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 65 if we want to be charitable, we can say that it was for the achievement of some public end. In any event, the corporations had the protection of the state, either for the purpose of furthering the ends of the state, or for merely further- ing the ends of the companies (or perhaps an intermixture of both). If Henry Carter Adams was correct, and if the revisionist business histo- rians, such as Allan Nevins, are correct, then the corporations indeed did exist in the nineteenth century for social ends. The legal nexus was effected, as I have said, by a protecting blanket of private law, and, perhaps of more importance, by a set of public law (that is, con- stitutional) doctrines created out of the whole cloth by the Supreme Court in the post-Civil War period, a period that lasted until 1937. Public Law Soon after the Fourteenth Amendment was added, the Court, in the Slaughterhouse case and in Munn v. Illinois, held that the amendment could not be used by corporations. Their remedy, said the Court in Munn, was to elect new legislators (a lesson, be it noted, that was filed but not forgotten). After the Supreme Court a few years later changed its mind and found that corporations were indeed persons within the meaning of the amendment, the businessman looked to Their Celestial Majesties on the Court as the ultimate protectors of his rights. As Commons said, this meant that the court occupied "the unique position of the first authoritative faculty of political economy in the world's history. They were a set of economic philosopher-kings, no less, and that even though William Howard Taft, when Solicitor General, called the justices a group of "mummies." The justices not only discovered, in Jhering's "heaven of legal con- cepts," that corporations were persons, but also acted as a constitutional convention to revise the due process clauses to make them apply to the substance or content of legislation as well as to the procedure by which government dealt with life, liberty, and property. That remarkable in- vention enabled a majority of the Court to read, as Justice Holmes said in Lochner v. New York, Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics into the Constitution. Holmes was quite right in maintaining that the Lochner decision was based on an economic theory that most of the nation repudiated, but that did not deter the Fumbling Five and Fallible Four. Reading their notions of good social policy into the Constitution, they did as much as any court could to insure that corporations would become large and strong, and much more than any court has in any other country.</page><page sequence="8">66 Arthur S. Miller If we consider the Supreme Court to be an instrument of governance, which it is, and that it renders decisions for reasons other than adher- ence to Blackstone's quaint jurisprudential notions, then we may per- ceive a corpus of public law that insulated the companies from the pressures of a rising trade-union movement, Populism, and Grangerism. Congress, to be sure, assisted by passing statutes that outwardly looked to be anti-business, for example, the Sherman Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, and by standing still while the Court emascu- lated them in the name of sweet reasonableness. Some so-called radical historians, such as Gabriel Kolko, today maintain that such statutes were passed to help business. That period of judicial supremacy in economic policy matters lasted, as we all know, until the 1930s, at which time the economic system was shattered in the Great Depression. At that point even the justices could see, however haltingly, that interests other than the entrepreneurs' desire for profit making had to be recognized. The trickle of cases that began with Blaisdell v. Home Building and Loan Ass'n (1934), crested in 1937 in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and the Jones &amp; Laughlin case, and continued at flood stage through United States v. Darby Lumber Co. and Wickard v. Filburn in the forties, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. in the fifties, and Katzenbach v. McClung and Ferguson v. Skrupa in the sixties. Eco- nomic policy had become thoroughly politicized-de-judicialized-and left to the political branches of government (more and more the execu- tive) to control. The culmination of that we are seeing today in the New Economic Plan of the president, Phase II of which institutionalizes a type of corporativism on America. The statutory corporate state, to be sure, is no newcomer to the American political economy. Something similar was tried in 1933 in the National Industrial Recovery Act, which permitted industry groups to establish codes of fair competition in return for the recognition of labor to organize. The NIRA, as we all know, was invalidated by the Su- preme Court in 1935, thereby rescuing President Roosevelt from an increasingly chaotic, even embarrassing situation. Outlawing the NIRA did not mean that all of its manifestations died; many of them have continued in other forms, such as trade association activity and the like. Since 1929 the United States has sped through a series of economic theories from laissez faire to Keynesianism (the Employment Act of 1946) to the present acceptance of Galbraithian notions -and the latter by a "conservative" president and the executives of the major corpo- rations! This is said to be temporary, a short-run expedient preliminary to an attempted reversion to something else, with that something being so clouded in rhetoric that no one knows what it is. Presumably it might</page><page sequence="9">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 67 be Keynesianism, and possibly it may even be that ideal, never realized, of a free market economy. But the fog on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue is thicker than the smog in Los Angeles. I am confident, al- though the thought is depressing, that no one in the higher reaches of government now knows what will happen after Phase II terminates. Maybe it will last forever, "somewhere short of infinity," as the Wall Street Journal put it. I do not think it is possible to revert to any status quo ante. The government's hand will stay on the economic tiller, which means that management and labor will be asked, even forced, to further the ends of the state. The nation, the world is too small and too interdependent any longer to tolerate, even in theory, the idea of two governing struc- tures-political and economic-purportedly separated from each other. Just as formal federalism in this country is now at least obsolescent and perhaps obsolete, even in the face of cries-touching cries, to be sure -for participatory democracy, so too the informal, functional feder- alism of government and the corporate giants will accent the positive of cooperation rather than the negative of autonomy. I should like to devote the remainder of this speculative paper to that notion. The Government-Corporation Symbiosis My thesis can be simply stated: There is a growing fusion of political and economic power into a new form of politico-economic structure, namely, a group-person, that at once transcends the arithmetical sum of its parts, which are the public group of government and the private group of the corporations (and other important social organizations). The shorthand term for this is the corporate state. How and why did it come about? What are its principal manifestations? What are the impli- cations for the future? Those are large questions, each of which would take a volume to answer. All I can hope to do now is to sketch in some of the outlines of the development. What has been said thus far, I hope, will serve to indicate that the corporate state, American style, is both the culmination of historical legal and economic situations and a milestone on the road to some other type of social order. If we use trend analysis, the beginnings of corporativism can be seen in the nineteenth century; it also is neces- sary to extrapolate into the future. What is said now relates, in the main, to a description of the present. Recall, if you will, the four segments of my proposed definition of corporativism: (a) the merger of political and economic power; (b) a legal nexus effecting that merger; (c) the creation of a transcendent group-person; and (d) the submergence of the in- dividual into the group.</page><page sequence="10">68 Arthur S. Miller Rise of the Positive State We should note the emergence of two characteristic institutions of the modem era: first, a government that has undertaken affirmative obliga- tions toward the economy or the Positive State; and, second, the super- corporations, the few hundred corporate giants that dominate the econo- my and set its tone and direction. In point of historical time, the devel- opment has been simultaneous for all practical purposes, although, no doubt, the corporate juggernauts antedated the Positive State by a few decades. Each needs and complements the other; taken together, they are the United (Corporate) States of America. In brief, the Positive State is a shorthand term for the express accept- ance by the federal government - and thus by the American people - of an affirmative responsibility for the economic well-being of all. It in- volves a societal shouldering of a duty of constitutional dimensions, a duty to take action to create and maintain within the economy minimal conditions of employment opportunities and of the basic necessities of life. Exemplified in a broad range of programs, it is the American version of the welfare state. It received its "charter" in the Employment Act of 1946, which, although a statute, in its importance may be said to have made constitutional law. According to that act, "the continuing policy and responsibility" of the federal government is "to use all practicable means consistent with its needs and obligations and other essential considerations of national policy, with the assistance and cooperation of industry, agriculture, labor, and state and local governments" to create and maintain condi- tions "under which there will be afforded useful employment opportu- nities ... and to promote maximum employment, production and pur- chasing power." (Emphasis added.) In short, it is a commitment to promote economic growth as a Good Thing. As we all know, there are numerous programs by which the government seeks to carry out that commitment. And as we are beginning to realize, however slowly, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 is a commitment to further the "quality of life." The additional implication is that the government, by design or by inadvertence, has now enunciated two policies that are often basically inconsistent. But that is The American Way. I do not criticize it, but merely point out that at some future time some hard choices must be made between the quantitative goals of the Employment Act and the qualitative goals of the Environmental Act. There are at least five characteristics of the Positive State that are worth mention. The change from a Constitution of limitations to one of powers. No</page><page sequence="11">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 69 longer do we believe in the Jeffersonian idea that "that government is best that governs least"; the prevailing idea, in the words of Robert Hutchins, is that "that government is best that governs best." The turning point came in 1937 in Chief Justice Hughes's opinion in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, a minimum wage case in which a statute was attacked as a deprivation of freedom of contract. Said Hughes: The liberty safeguarded [by the Fourteenth Amendment] is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people. Liberty under the Constitution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of due process, and regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the commu- nity is due process. Ponder that for a moment. The Supreme Court recognized that liberty could be infringed by forces other than government, and, even more important, those other forces may require the affirmative intervention of government to counteract them. Edward S. Corwin commented: "From being a limitation on legislative power, the due process clause becomes an actual instigation to legislative action of a levelling nature." The advent of a system of overt economic planning. The open nature of the planning function of government is significant. A good case can be made, as George Soule has said, for the proposition that "the United States government has at all times followed plans of some sort that were directed toward the economic welfare of its citizens." However, with that infinite capacity of Americans for self-delusion, this was seldom, if ever, recognized. Planning was a bad word; governments were not supposed to do it, for that led down the path of creeping socialism; in our mythology only corporations and natural persons were allowed to plan. We are older now-I do not say wiser-and have a penchant for telling it like it is. No one blinks anymore when that bad four-letter word plan is used in connection with government and the economy. To the contrary, we have in recent months witnessed the extraordinary spec- tacle of corporate managers coming to Washington and telling govern- ment to regulate them; that is at least wryly amusing, and it might even be astonishing were we to believe that in so doing the corporate execu- tives were acting contrary to their perception of the best interests of their companies. That quite obviously those hard-headed men do not so believe should make us all stop and wonder, at least a little, about the meaning of it all. My conclusion is that this is probative evidence that the president's economic planning by and large benefits the corpo- rations. This is not a novel thought, to be sure, for more than a few have said the same thing.</page><page sequence="12">70 Arthur S. Miller The alteration of governmentalframework. Federalism and the separa- tion of powers are becoming obsolescent concepts. Economic planning, Karl Loewenstein once said, is the DDT of federalism, and so it seems to be. Planning by government generates a need for unified and probably uniform economic policies throughout the nation. That requirement runs counter to the diversity inherent in federalism, and it is also contrary to the fragmentation of power within the national government itself. The fifty states are anachronisms, on the way to becoming little more impor- tant than those vestigial remnants of an agricultural society, the county governments. Within the national government itself, power has flowed to the executive, aided by a more than willing Congress, members of which are quite happy to draw their paychecks and to act as ombudsmen for their constituents while letting effective control over national policies become presidential. So, too, with the judiciary, which has quietly abdicated any significant role with respect to economic affairs, and which, for that matter, seems ever increasingly to want to exemplify the Hamiltonian label of "the least dangerous branch." I realize that in suggesting that the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, has more a ceremonial role than a position as an important actor in the political arena I am running counter to a large amount of the conventional wisdom. Those who dispute my view, however, must show-in this case, in economic matters-where the Court has wielded significant power recently. Surely it is fair to say that it no longer is an authoritative faculty of political economy, although it may be that it is trying (at least it did during the tenure of Earl Warren) to be an ultimate arbiter of social ethics. The politicization of law and the legal process. Law, in the sense of interdiction, has little role to play in the higher reaches of the American bureaucracies, both public and private. With the advent of public law as the dominant force in our legal system, law has become purposive and instrumental. The net result, as Washington lawyer Charles Horsky said in 1952, is that ours is emphatically a "government of men, not of law." The guru of academic administrative law specialists, Kenneth Culp Davis, recently discovered this and let the world in on his secret in a book called Discretionary Justice. To me, a better book on the point is Theodore Lowi's The End of Liberalism, and its sequel, The Politics of Disorder. Power rests in the bureaucrats, whether they exist in Gal- braith's "technostructures" or Meynaud's "technocracy." Despite the abundance of lawyers in Washington, it is lawyers as apparatchiks rather than as professionals that is the dominant theme of a government of lawyers, not of men. Law has been politicized both in its making and its enforcement, in</page><page sequence="13">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 71 what might be called the inputs and the outputs; this is not entirely true, but enough so to indicate an emerging pattern. Bargaining among in- terest groups, as many observers have noted, tends to make public policy (that is, law) the resultant of a parallelogram of conflicting politi- cal forces. At the other end of the pipeline, a similar process of bargain- ing is evident in law enforcement. A number of examples may be mentioned. In criminal law administration, plea bargaining is now so widespread that we have the weighty testimony of the chief justice of the United States that it is necessary for the viability of the system. (Burger did not put it quite that way, to be sure; he said that if only 10 percent fewer suspects pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial, the process would break down.) For present purposes, law enforcement bargaining takes place in, for example, the consent decree practice in antitrust litigation. That is plea bargaining in the executive suites, in the area of white-collar crime. Trade offs are made and bargains are struck. Other examples include the guaranteed loan to Lockheed and rewriting its C5-A contract, and the way in which government caved in to the unions to allow retroactivity in previously negotiated wage contracts. I do not wish to press this point too far, but do suggest that enforce- ment, which is outwardly the clearest instance of the separation of business and state, becomes merely an internal dialogue, a family squabble, to the extent that bargaining exists in the outputs of the system in business matters. Theodore Lowi, by the way, calls for some- thing termed juridical democracy, which apparently means judicializing enforcement without the intervention of the human element, but that is hardly a happy, valid, or viable resolution of a perplexing legal situation. The progressive blurring of the line between public and private govern- ment- business relationships. It is not only Lockheed and Penn Central that are systematically aided by government; so, too, are large segments of the economic order. As Robin Marris expressed it: "The industrial capital of western democracies is no longer divided into two classes, 'public' and 'private,' but rather into three, 'public,' 'private,' and 'corpo- rate.' The corporate sector like to be described as 'private,' but this may represent no more than a desire to conceal." Marris, or any present-day observer, is not saying much that is new. As long ago as 1913 Woodrow Wilson called attention to the same phenomenon in The New Freedom: One of the most alarming phenomena of the time, or rather it would be alarming if the nation had not awakened to it and shown its determination to control it, one of the most significant signs of the new social era is the degree to which government has become associated with business. I speak, for the moment, of the control over the government exercised by Big Business. Behind the whole</page><page sequence="14">72 Arhtur S. Miller subject, of course, is the truth that, in the new order, government and business must be associated closely. So they must be and so they are, then and more so now. To some minor extent, it should be noted, the Supreme Court has recognized the public nature of private business and has held that con- stitutional norms are applicable to corporations. There are only two cases that do that directly, however, Marsh v. Alabama (1946) and the Logan Valley Plaza decision in 1968. Two swallows do not a summer make, nor do two cases a legal doctrine. Even so, we may well be in that era that Alexander Pekelis predicted in the 1940s when he said that the next generation of constitutional lawyers would have ever more to be concerned with private governments. It is to be noted that the White Primary Cases do recognize the private governing power of the Demo- cratic Party, and that there are a clutch of other decisions in which the Court has tended to blur the consitutional line between government and private group. The technical doctrine revolves around the concept of state action, for the Constitution runs against governments (the state) only. The increasingly perplexing problem is this: What is a govern- ment? The Supercorporations The previous introduction into the nature of modern government is too brief. What is emphasized is that, without amendment, a new form of government has arrived in these United States. The other half of the symbiotic relationship is the growth of the corporate giants, which needs no documentation or restatement. Let me make four remarks only in passing. First, there seems to be much in what Galbraith calls "the principle of convergence." Industrial nations, wherever located, tend to form similar institutions. That does not mean there is no difference between, for example, General Motors and a Soviet organization. As Raymond Aron, among others, has said, there is the great difference in the matter of who owns and who controls. Second, Galbraith's "impera- tives of technology" do not necessarily explain the growth of the super- corporations in the United States. Third, government and business, far from being hostile to each other, exist in what may be called a system of antagonistic cooperation. Quite possibly, or even probably, that antagon- ism is more ostensible than real. Each needs the other, and perhaps could not exist without the other. Finally, the supercorporations are here to stay. Eighty years of antitrust enforcement should have taught us that government is not going to do anything significant about their size. No doubt a case can be made, and to me it is persuasive, that the large enterprise is not as innovative as its apologists contend (the small busi-</page><page sequence="15">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 73 ness and the individual inventor do things better), but it is there in disembodied immortality. The status quo ante of 1850 or 1890 or even 1920 simply is not going to reappear. The Emerging Synthesis There are those who suggest we are on the verge of a new renais- sance. Just as the nation-state a few hundred years ago challenged the church for dominance in the Western world, so now the giant corpo- rations are challenging the nation-states. Maybe so. However, it does not seem likely that the state will wither away, as these non-Marxists maintain, but rather that it will take on a new form. It already has, in my judgment. How it did this is the first question; what has been produced is the second. A "Living Law" Analysis The new form is the emerging corporate state, although we do not have a full-blown theory about it, nor even a theory about the giant corporations and their role in the American polity. As Andrew Hacker recently said, "neither our constitutional law nor our political theory is able to account for the corporate presence in the arena of social power. Indeed, it is not at all clear by what right the corporation is entitled to power at all." That, in sum, is the problem of legitimacy: How does the politico-economic power achieve legitimacy? As Dean Edward S. Ma- son has said: "Who selected these men, if not to rule over us, at least to exercise vast authority, and to whom are they responsible? The answer to the first question is quite clearly: they selected themselves. The answer to the second is, at best, nebulous. This, in a nutshell, constitutes the problem of legitimacy." It is a real problem, an ever growing one, but one that merely can be noted here. The essential question at the moment is how it can be demonstrated that some type of legal nexus exists between the corporation and the state. The answer involves a "living law" analysis, which requires: (1) primary focus on the important societal decision and asking the ques- tion: Who makes those decisions, how, and with what effects? (2) a distinction between those who exercise formal authority to make such decisions and those who exercise effective control over them; (3) a knowledge of the factors that influence or control given decisions; and (4) an appeciation of what difference decisions make in the social struc- ture. Those are large and difficult questions; they cannot be answered briefly. The basic thought proffered is that important societal decisions</page><page sequence="16">74 Arthur S. Miller tend more and more to be made by an amalgam of the interactions of public and private bureaucracies. Quite often these decisions-they are matters of important public policy -are put into official form through the formal authority of government officials. (This is not always so, for perhaps equally often corporate managers can do so, but only with express or tacit delegation of authority from the state.) The flow of decisions thus made, which often are administrative rather than legisla- tive or judicial, constitute the living law. The living law is principally associated with Eugen Ehrlich, a defunct Austrian jurisprude who wrote The Fundamental Principles of the Soci- ology of Law several decades ago. Ehrlich maintained that the living law is to be seen "in contrast to that which is in force merely in the courts and with the officials. The living law is that law which is not imprisoned in rules of law, but which dominates life itself. The sources of its knowledge are above all the modern documents, and also immediate study of life itself, of commerce, of customs and usage, and of all sorts of organizations, including those which are recognized by the law, and, indeed, those which are disapproved by the law." The living law, in other words, is the flow of decisions important to Americans; some are made by private officers, others by public officials. Many of those made privately are of national significance. Furthermore, many of those made by public officials are in fact influenced, not to say controlled, by outside forces, of which the giant corporation is the most important. Law, then, is more than the "command of the sovereign" or a corpus of rules. It is what the important societal decision makers actually do; it is a flow of decisions, a process rather than a static system. The black-letter rules are important and necessary, but are only part of the picture. The myriad routine transactions between the two characteristic institutions of the day-big government and big business-make up a body of living law. At times it is formalized in statute, administrative rule, or even in judicial decision, but not always, or even mostly. This is particularly true of the "how" of decision making, the procedure by which decisions are made; it, too, is law in the sense used here. What is suggested is that a system of law exists in the United States, which consists of the informal transactions between government and a pluralistic social group (in our case, the corporations). Although the system at times is formalized, it more often exists as a set of working rules which are understood by the participants, but which seldom re- ceive formal cognizance. This system is not necessarily cohesive and consistent; it is a series of laws, rather than a logical whole. It is the means by which the various subgovernments within Washington oper- ate.</page><page sequence="17">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 75 In agricultural matters, to take one example, an obscure congressman from an obscure district in an obscure state, by the name of Jamie Whitten, exercises as much or more real power than does the secretary of agriculture. Another example are the many advisory committees that flourish in Washington which are made up of industry representatives. These committees have much to say about what is done in government, and their operations make up a body of procedural living law. The Business Council stoutly maintains that it is a private group that just happens to have a small office in the Department of Commerce; it also refuses to divulge what goes on within its meetings, save for an occa- sional article noting that some high governmental official has spoken to the council. Its actual power is unknown, at least to me, but it does seem to be considerable. Washington law firms tend to be brokers between the business community and government. The list is almost endless. This complex web of informal interactions constitutes what I am calling, with Ehrlich, the living law of American corporativism. If the notion is valid, then it effects the legal nexus between the corporation and the state. It is law in that it enables power to be exercised, and it is invisible law in that it is not codified or otherwise entombed in the musty volumes of law libraries. I think that I can find some similar ideas in John R. Commons. For example, Commons speaks of the corporation's charter as a group of promises and commands which the state makes in the form of working rules indicating how the officials of the state shall act in the future in matters affecting the association, the members of the association, and the persons not members. It is these promises and commands, or working rules, of officials which constitute the charter and determine the status of the association.... This collective, intangible living process of individuals, the functionaries of the state find already in a trembling existence and then proceed "artificially" to guide the individuals concerned and give it a safer existence. The guidance is made through promising to them a certain line of behav- ior on the part of public officials, which sets forth the limits on their private behavior and the assistance they may expect on the part of officials. This is not to say that Commons is openly embracing Ehrlichian ju- risprudence, or that he would be in agreement with its application here, but as I read him, he comes close; his "working rules" seem to parallel Ehrlich's "living law." To me it is persuasive that a legal connection can thus be shown between the corporation and the state, with the resulting synthesis a form of corporativism. There are, of course, other means by which the necessary nexus can be shown, principally the notion of contract. The</page><page sequence="18">76 Arthur S. Miller arms industry provides the best illustration of the way in which large corporations are welded to the state; it is the "arsenalization" of a large segment of American business, a form of nationalization which, with Lockheed as an example, has few of the benefits of public ownership and many of the shortcomings. We have managed in the production of weapons to have the worst of two worlds. Perhaps the apt title for the product is Seymour Melman's, Pentagon Capitalism. In any event, the instrument of contract does provide the legal connection between state and enterprise, which is why Nieburg says arms production "at once resembles traditional private enterprise and the corporate state of fas- cism." The Consequence The consequence of a fast-moving development has been well stated by Allen Schick: "It is no longer possible to tell where private ends and the public begins as public and private funds and workers flow and work side by side in SST development, job training, and countless other programs. In the basic social accounts, the public-private distinction no longer is significant; more and more, the accounts concentrate on the aggregate social input and output, regardless of its public or private character." We have, in sum, a new social order, appropriately termed the corporate state, American style. Slowly emerging, its contours are becoming clearer with each passing year. When President Nixon established a fifteen-person Pay Board in early November 1971, composed of management, labor, and public members, only one person - the chairman - was to be a full-time public employee. The others are private citizens. When the board acts, it has delegated power from the state-from Congress to Nixon to George Meany (and others) -that institutionalizes the corporate state. This was clearly seen by Judge Harold Leventhal when he ruled in October that Phase I was valid; Leventhal carefully excluded the question of delegation to private groups from his ruling, noting that "the President's plans ... do present the very kind of delegation of government power to private groups" that was invalidated in 1935 by the Supreme Court. If that be so, then we need not rely on a living law analysis to show the necessary legal nexus. I am not predicting that the delegation to the Pay Board will be in- validated, when it is challenged in the courts. Since Congress has passed the Phase II statute essentially as drafted in the Treasury Department, that would take a more courageous Supreme Court than we now have, as well as one not so ready to constitutionalize what the politicians want. A consequence of the development is the gradual emergence of the state as coordinator, as regulator, as the dominant member of the duo.</page><page sequence="19">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 77 "The role of the state will rise and that of business shrink," Robert Heilbroner predicts; he bases his forecast on the deliberate application of intelligence to social problems. Heilbroner apparently agrees with Daniel Bell, who says that we are entering into a post-industrial society, and that the new men of power are the "scientists, the mathematicians, the economists, and the engineers of the new computer technology." They may be correct, although one should be careful about falling into the conceit of academics and unduly emphasizing the role of the men of ideas. Even so, Galbraith espouses similar views when he maintains that the locus of power is in our public and private bureaucracies, "'the technostructure," or those who bring specialized knowledge to group or collective decision making. My own guess differs slightly: the state will become more and more important, but in the future, as in the past, those with the wealth will have the ultimate power. The United States, a timocracy today, is not likely to change in the future. Government today, the Positive State or the corporate state, is a collectivity that is the hypostatization of the public interest, and the public interest is greater than the arithmetical sum of the private in- terests of the nation. Government has a momentum of its own, separate from and greater than individual interests. In a little noted statement a decade ago, President Kennedy expressed the same thought. In re- sponse to a question at a press conference about labor-management relations, Kennedy said: "These companies are free and the unions are free. All we [the executive] can try to do is to indicate to them the public interest which is there. After all, the public interest is the sum of the private interests, or perhaps it's even sometimes a little more. In fact, it is a little more." The president thereby articulated a view of government basically different from that which existed historically (at least in theory). A further implication was that the state is some sort of group-person, which, I believe, poses substantial constitutional questions. Suddenly, the age-old constitutional philosophy of limited government has been reversed; we now have a government of powers, rather than of limita- tions. That government has drives and interests of its own to further; since it has a monopoly on force and on the peaceful settlement of disputes, it does further them. Ernest Barker said in 1933: If we make groups real persons, we shall make the national State a real person. If we make the State a real person, with a real will, we make it indeed a Leviathan -a Leviathan which is not an automaton, like the Leviathan of Hobbes, but a living reality. When its will collides with other wills, it may claim that, being the greatest, it must and shall carry the day; and its supreme will may thus become a</page><page sequence="20">78 Arthur S. Miller supreme force. If and when that happens, not only may the State become the one real person and the one true group, which eliminates or assimilates others: it may also become a mere personal power which eliminates its own true nature as a specific purpose directed to Law or Right. I submit to you that the state in the modern era has become an anthropomorphic superperson whose reality is as real as that of human beings; that this is being recognized in governmental policies from all branches of government; and that the Supreme Court, even when it has been making its rulings that appear to further individual rights and liberties, has really often been talking about individuals as members of groups. That latter point is the final element in my definition of the corporate state-the submergence of the individual into the group. It is seen, for example, in the study of political science, where, since David Truman rediscovered Arthur Bentley, the prevailing ideology has been one of pluralism (although recent studies, such as those by Henry Kariel and Theodore Lowi, carefully note the shortcomings of the pluralistic group model of policy making). Economics, if I may venture to tread there, also is beginning, or has begun, to think in terms of the corporation as the basic unit of the economy, having developed somewhat since An- dreas Papandreou's observation twenty years ago that "the economist has not evolved a theory of conscious cooperation." Lawyers, as usual, have lagged; group theories of politics and of economics have not found a counterpart in a group theory of law. There has been a little - a very little - stirring by the lawyers in that direction, but not enough even to note. My suggestion is that the constitutional law produced by the Supreme Court in the past several decades can, in large part, be structured around a theme of group action, that the decisions usually said to protect individual rights and liberties have, rather, tended to create a constitutional law of associational activity. The cases in- clude those involving racial segregation, urban voters (reapportionment of legislatures), and church and state (often the cases are brought by Jehovah's Witnesses or members of some other sect). Of course, not all constitutional decisions fall into the law of associ- ational activity category, but enough do to make the development wor- thy of note. Of possible interest also is the increasing use of class actions, a procedural device whereby one plaintiff is permitted to repre- sent a large number (often neither identified nor readily identifiable) of others who are considered to be in the same situation. Finally, a con- stitutional right of association has, by judicial legerdemain, been found within the interstices of the First Amendment.</page><page sequence="21">Legal Foundations of the Corporate State 79 That the idea of human freedom is a sometime thing, quite possibly on its way out, is one implication of what I have just said. Freedom becomes that of choosing which group or groups with which one wishes to associate. Perhaps freedom is now Hegelian: the liberty to do what one should do. One need not be a disciple of B. F. Skinner to think that human freedom is a value limited in time and space, in time to the past two or three hundred years, in space to a portion of the Western world. I do not applaud that, but merely note it. By way of conclusion, I should like to say what should have been said earlier: This paper is descriptive, not normative. There are no value judgments made or implied. A definition of the emerging politi- co-economic order has been attempted. Left dangling are a host of problems raised by that system of governance, which must await another time.</page></plain_text>
