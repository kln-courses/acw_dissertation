A recent popular version of the Bible in English, the work of eminent scholars (4), makes a notable departure from the consensus of modern opinion in its translation of Genesis 1, 2C. The sentence ruah 9 Elohim nfrahefeth cal peney hammayim is rendered « a tem- pestuous wind was raging over the surface of the waters ». Aside from « tempestuous » and « raging », there is, of course, no objec- tion to « wind » as a meaning for ruah, alone; nor could its use in this passage encounter serious theological opposition, with Ephraem and Theodoret both declaring in its favor. The real question is whether the recent translation, taken entire, is a natural expression of the Hebrew writer's thought. To offer to readers of Biblica only a brief and partial view of this question, after its exhaustive treatment nine years ago in the masterly study of Professor Smoronski (2), is a proceeding which calls for some explanation.

J. to criticise the same exegetical opinion which was so thoroughly refu- ted there, but more particularly as that opinion has reappeared in a later source and a more extreme form. Moreover, this criticism origi- nated in an address too limited by the demands of its occasion to permit anything like the admirable thoroughness of Smoronski' s plan; and even in its present amplification it still makes no para- mount appeal to the history of exegesis, which engaged the greater measure of Smoronski's attention,, but bases its main argument on a different method of approach, relying chiefly on a comparative study of Biblical Hebrew. It has further been necessary to notice certain opinions advanced by a very recent commentator on Genesis, because of their partial agreement with the new « American transla- tion ». Naturally the conclusion reached in this paper is substantially identical with that of Smoronski, and some details of the evidence will be recognised as having been more fully treated by him. How- ever, what is here offered is wholly the fruit of independent re- search; and, for the reasons just assigned, it seems advisable to leave the argument in that original setting which provides its most appro- priate background. Since the appeal of this discussion is not to the authority oí commentators, let it suffice to select for brief notice a few landmarks in the history of exegesis which may serve the purpose of an intro ductory sketch. A suggestion that ruak in Gen. 1, 2 may have been understood as « wind » appears as early as the Targum of Onqelos (£). Here, of course, rufrc? is still ambiguous in itselt, and there has been some objection to translating the sentence « a wind from before Yahweh was blowing upon the surface of the water » ; yet the predicate nfnasseb(i is certainly most appropriate to « wind », and most scho- lars have so understood the passage (2). The suggestion is not so evident in the Targums of Jonathan and of Jerusalem (3), since these, while retaining the verb « blowing », qualify its subject as a « mite? of mercy from before Yahweh », which Franz Delitzsch interprets as « the spirit of love » (4). Thereafter a preference for « wind » appears from time to time in Jewish exegesis, and is com- monly ascribed to Ibn Ezra and Saadiah. But when Rosen- (4) Apud Walton, Biblia Poly gioita, I, fol. 3.

According to Schöttgen (2) the Bereshith Rabbah once and the Zohar in several places interpret ruab *Elohim as « the spirit of the King Mašiah », not identical with himself, but at least not a wind, since they proceed to identify it with that « spirit of Yah weh » which Isaias (3) foretells « will rest upon him ». Meanwhile the 3tve$[Aa fteov ejteqpeQexo of the LXX, which is not more specific than the Hebrew itself, had been practically followed by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion (4), and faithfully ren- dered by the Vulgate as spiritus Dei ferebatur . Most of the Fathers justly identified « the Spirit of God » with the Third Divine Person, without thereby ascribing to the ancient Hebrew mind a more advanced conception of « spirit » than the proper equivalent of the anthropomorphic « breath of God » attributed to the Deity as most expressive of His own supreme vitality and His communication of life to finite things. But a few of the earlier Fathers decided in favor oí « wind ». Tertullian seems to waver between it and « spirit» in different passages (5). Ephraem (6) and Theodoret (7) expressly defend «wind». Heinisch, however, in ascribing this preference to the Antiochene School in common, seems to have overlooked Chrysostom and Cyril of Jerusalem. The former (8) takes the jtveîipitt *&amp;eoî3 as a principle of vitality infused into the water; the latter (9) quotes Gen. 1, 2 as the climax of an argument for the pre-eminence of water among the elements. Neither passage is intelligible if only wind affected the water (i0). (*) Scholia in G ene sin, 1821, 67. (2) Horae Hebraicae et Talmudicae , 1742, II, 120, 143. (3) Isa. 11, 2.

McClellan, S. J. Coming to modem times, I cannot speak of Jewish exegesis from first-hand acquaintance. But other exegetes of all schools have been almost unanimous in understanding either «the spirit of G&lt; d » or at least « a divine spirit » (Gottesgeist) as intended in this pas- sage (£). As to the predicate, they are about equally divided between « brooding » and « hovering ». The most persistent defender of « wind » is the latest Catholic commentator on Genesis, Dr. Paul Heinisch (*). He claims the agreement of Joüon (3), but in the ab- sence of a reference I cannot verify this. Although Heinisch by no means supports the whole translation of the « American » version, certain of his arguments will presently call for comment. More than half of thç modern commentators whom this writer has been able to consult, record the possibility of the rendering « wind », although they reject it. Their commonest objection appears to be the incon- gruity of nfrakefeth as predicated of a wind, especially a « wind of 'Elohim », a phrase which would normally suggest a wind of uncom- mon force. I. This very suggestion serves to introduce the first philolo- gical argument that seems worth advancing, although it be merely an « argument from silence ». If ruabi, *Elohim means &lt;&lt; a tempes- tuous wind », the divine name must be an attributive genitive, sug- gesting « godlike » as surpassing the ordinary. Gesenius (4), unlike his modern editors, fully discusses the logical basis of this genitival analogy, and thinks that the actual magnitude of the object suggest- ed special divine causation or production as the idea to be empha- sized, so that the object was « God's » as being exceptional enough to proceed directly from Him. At all events, comparing Gesenius with his two chief editors, Buhl (5) and Brown*Driver-Briggs (6), it is instructive to collect all the cases acknowledged by any of the three. Under the divine names 9 El, *Elohim, and Yahweh the three lexicographers illustrate the attributive genitive by several references (l) So Calmet, Rosenmüller, Lamy, Delitzsch, Dillmann, Driver, Spurrell, de Hummelauer, Hoberg, Gunkel, Skinner, Kautzsch, Het- zenauer, Ryle, Murillo, Holzinger, Procksch, Erith, E.

There finally remain three well known instances of *El in this construction (Ps. 36, 7; 80, 10; Isa, 14, 13), and two of 9Elohim (Gen. 30, 8; Ps. 68, 18). For Yahweh the single case of Ps. 104, 16, «the trees of Yahweh are full of sap », is alleged by Gesenius alone, although here the parallel clause « the cedars of Lebanon which he has planted » explains the genitive in the first member as denoting source, or possibly mere possession. One additional case sometimes alleged is that of nesV 9 Elohim in Gen. 23, 6 ( 4 ) ; but the genitive here is not taken as attributive by any of the lexicographers above mentioned, Genesius rendering the phrase as princeps seu phylarcha a Deo constitutus (as if the governing noun were a passive partici- ple, « one exalted of God »), while Buhl leaves it unexplained and Brown-Driver-Briggs do not even refer to it. Finally, in their separate articles on ruah, , none of the three authors regards 9 Elohim as an attributive genitive in Gen. 1, 2, though all of them notice the reference. In general, the tendency to recur to this attributive explanation of a divine name in the genitive seems to be too hastily obeyed by modern interpreters of a certain conventional type. II. Turning, secondly, to the positive side of the study, we are dealing with two words whose frequent conjunction in the Old Tes- tament seems to suggest their right to first consideration as a composite phrase. Thus considered, it is impossible to ignore cer- tain definite laws of the value of this phrase in various contexts. Ruah 9 Elohim occurs 19 times, ruah Yahweh 27 times (excluding one parallel), and ruah with a possessive suffix referring to the Deity is found 28 times. Any one who collates and carefully compares all of these passages will find that in the vast majority of cases the context shows clearly enough whether «breath», «wind», or «spi- rit » is the natural and appropriate meaning of ruah* It is the exceptional cases of real ambiguity which prove enlightening under comparative study. In the first place, they reveal the fact that « breath » is the common concept from which « spirit » on the one hand and « wind » on the other derive independently. For the translator has to hesi- tate between «breath» and «wind» in three places (Ex. 15, 10; (*) To which my attention was privately called after a briefer statement of this argument had been read before the American Oriental Society.</page><page sequence="6">522 William H. McClellan, S. J. Isa. 40, 7; Hos. 13, 15), and contrariwise between «breath» and «spirit» in six others (Gen. 6, 3; Job. 27, 3; 33, 4; 34, 14; Ps. 104, 30; Ezek. 37, 14). But it is difficult, if not impossible, io find a single context in which the choice lies directly between « wind » and « spirit», unless such is really the case in Gen. 1, 2. Whatever the nature of the action here predicated of the ruah *Elohim , the effect of this action is not expressly recorded. But wherever such effect is evident (as in these nine passages), the operation of God's « spirit » and of His « wind » seem to stand at opposite extremes, with His « breath » as the more general and indeterminate agency. Heinisch, it is true, thinks otherwise. He would make a « wind of Yahweh » not only an immediate alternative to a « spirit », but even preferable to the latter, in two passages where « the spirit of Yahweh », as affecting the ministry of the prophets, has generally been considered the natural rendering: « Auch 3 Kön. 18, 12; 4 Kon. 2, 16 ist die ruah Jahve, welche den Propheten entrücken kann, eine ausserhalb des Propheten wirkende, ihn tragende Kraft, und der Israelit wird auch hier an einen Wind gedacht haben, der den Got- tesmann plötzlich an einen anderen Ort versetzt » (4). This judgment scarcely suggests a comprehensive study of all the pertinent passages. The ruah Yahweh does indeed « come upon » the human subject from without, and necessarily so; but it is not considered then as « ausserhalb wirkende » ; it operates through its recipient as if from within him, and often by augmenting the energy of some natural faculty, although more commonly by the production of effects alto- gether preternatural. This is uniformly true even of exceptional bodily power (as in the case of Samson) ; and unless « the Israelite would have thought of a wind » in such cases, there is no reason to infer that he did so merely because the effect upon the recipient's person involved bodily transportation from place to place. In fact, in Ezek. 2, 2 and 37, 1 (not to mention any other instances) the language, which is much more circumstantial than in Heinisch's two passages, conveys no impression of the prophet's being blown into another posture or situation by a wind, or acted upon by any force external to his person at the moment of operation, however extrinsic in its source or origin. Thus the two passages adduced by Heinisch cannot be admitted to form an exception to the general principle just stated. (A) Op. cit. 96.</page><page sequence="7">The meaning of ruah 'Elohim in Genesis 1, 2 523 But a second fact is still more significant. In the three texts where the nature of the context suggests a choice between « breath » and « wind » as ascribed immediately to God, the agency is destruc- tive in tendency : « Thou didst blow with thy ruah , the sea covered them » (Ex 10, 10) - « The grass withers, the flower fades, be- cause the ruah of Yah weh blows upon it » (Isa. 40, 7) - « There shall come an east wind, a ruah of Yah weh coming up from the desert, and his spring shall become dry» (Hos. 13, 15). On the contrary, in all of the six cases where either « breath » or « spirit » satisfies the context, the agency is vivifying, energizing, beneficent: ♦« My ruah will not remain in man indefinitely, since he too is flesh » (Gen. 6, 3) - « My life is yet whole in me, and the ruafy of 'Elohim is in my nostrils » (Job. 27, 3) - « The ruah of 'Elohim has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life » (Job. 33, 4) - « If he recall to himself his ruah and his breath, all flesh will per- ish » (Job. 34, 14) - «Thou sendest forth thy ruah , they are created; thou renewest the face of the earth» (Ps. 104, 30) - «I will put my ruah in you, and you shall live» (Ezek. 37, 14). This law of the ideology of a divine ruah appears so stable as to be decisive for «spirit» in Gen. 1, 2, and exclusive of «wind». At the beginning of the wholly constructive process described in the Hexaëmeron, it is natural to understand « the spirit of 'Elohim » because of its invariably vitalizing and energizing function, as op- posed to the withering or blasting effect that regularly attaches to 'Elohim's « wind ». Heinisch would invalidate this argument by anticipation. He claims that in Gen. 1, 2 the ruah 3 Elohim has no historical function or purpose, but is merely a descriptive feature of the chaos, to which same category he then assigns the waste and desolate earth, the iehom , and the enveloping darkness. But picturesque details are altogether foreign to the passage, and these particular features have clearly no such purpose. The scene is simply drawn, and all of its lines reappear for modification during the Six Days. Every factor in the description of the chaos bears upon the succeeding narrative, and is introduced either to act or be acted upon. The alleged « wind » would form the only exception to this economy ; whereas a di- vinely infused force or principle of vitality would be no such exception, but of obvious practical value in the whole subsequent process. Here Heinisch again objects that « im folgenden Bericht ist nämlich von einer Tätigkeit des Gottesgeistes nicht die Rede ; Gott schafft durch</page><page sequence="8">524 William H. McClellan, S. J. sein Wort, er spricht, er tut, nicht aber wirkt er durch seinen Geist ». But it seems more natural to conclude, with almost all exegetes, that He effects everything through His spirit, in so far as this spirit informs inert matter with a positive aptitude for responding to the fiat of the creative word or decree. III. Heinisch has thus far merited attention for his arguments in defense of «wind» («die bewegte Luft, der Wind; 'Jahve's Hauch ' »), but he does not go the length of the American transla- tion « a tempestuous wind was raging » . Returning, in the third place, to this sentence as a whole, it may be observed that ruah *Elohim only veils in obscurity the notion of a « tempestuous wind », which a Hebrew writer would have been at no loss to express much more clearly. Wind is sometimes designated as « great » or « strong » , and sometimes as both together. But of all expressions of this class, the most stereotyped is precisely that for a « stormy » or « tempes- tuous » wind. Twice in the Psalms (107, 25; 148, 8) it is ruah se*arah&gt; and twice in Ezekiel (13, 11, 25) we find the plural, ruah se*arolh. No other expression of the same idea occurs oftener, and only one thus often. If a « tempestuous wind » figures in the pri- meval chaos, it is not easy to understand why this determinate phrase was not employed instead of something so vague as ruah * Elo him. IV. Finally, it is very doubtful whether rrfrafyefeth can express the action oí a violent wind, so as to be fitly rendered « raging » . Everyone knows that some obscurity attaches to this word ( raha / in picel), which occurs elsewhere only in Deut. 32, 11. What the eagle does to its brood in this passage has been the subject of much discussion. J. P. Peters (*), on the testimony of missionaries in Western North America, describes the parent bird, in that region, as « rushing down on the young eagle to strike it if necessary and drive it from its perch and make it fly ». He adds, on the same authority, that if the fledgling tires in flight the parent bird flies beneath to intercept and support it. Minimizing this protective function, Peters prefers the « rushing down » of the parent upon its inactive offspring as illustrating the radical meaning of the He- brew verb here under discussion, as it appears in Deuteronomy. (A) Bible and Spade , 1922, 57-59, well summarizes (though in popular form) Peters' articles in JBL 30 (191 J ) and 33 (1914), discussed by Smoronski (loc. cit.), in their bearing on this point.</page><page sequence="9">The meaning of ruah 'Elohim in Genesis 1, 2 525 S. R. Driver (4), on the other hand, quoting an observer of the Scottish eagle, records its habit of bearing up its young in their first awkward attempts, but finds it provoking those attempts only by hovering close above the young, and knows nothing of that vig- orous onslaught which wholly determines Peters' interpretation of the significant verb. It may be observed in passing that, in either case, a rather specialized habit is ascribed to the Griffon Vulture of the East by mere inference from the behavior of other species of eagles indige- nous to far distant regions, a method of argument which a zoologist might hesitate to accept as conclusive. However, the inference has some probability, and seems to be partly reflected by the verse in Deuteronomy (of which I adopt Driver's translation): « Like a vulture that stirreth up its nest, that hovereth over its young; He spread abroad His wings, He took him, He bore him upon His pinion » . In any case this passage affords our best source for the true interpretation of nfrafefeth as predicated of « the spirit of 9Elohim » in Gen. 1, 2. The imperfect, y*rakeft is the word which Driver has rendered « hovereth ». The first distich, in whose second member this word occurs, is the explicit term of a comparison drawn in the second distich. The language of this latter is clear beyond mistak- ing; and if that providential care and support which furnishes its whole theme should find no counterpart in the first distich, no such comparison could be drawn. This, however, would inevitably follow from the argument of Peters. For (as Smoronski well observes), "if any attack or forcible impact is at all ascribed to the vulture in the first distich, it is to be found in the « stirring up » described in the first member. If Peters is justified in rendering the second member also as «rushes down upon its young», so that the parallel between the two members of the distich is « synonymous », then it is obvious that the distich furnishes no point of comparison at all for the lesson of providential support which is the whole point of the second distich. Thus the parallelism of « hovereth » with « stirreth up » would seem to be « synthetic » or explanatory. But what is the more ex- (*) Deuteronomy , 1909, 357-8.</page><page sequence="10">526 William H. McClellan, S. J. plicit action denoted by the second verb, whose meaning is the point at issue ? The « stirring up » of the nest is obviously provocation to flight, but the facts adduced by Driver tend to show that this can be effected merely by the hovering of the parent above the young. This may, therefore, be all that y*rahef is meant to express ; - «as a vulture rouses its brood by hovering above them». « Rushing upon » or « beating against » the reluctant offspring is an explanation which the simile certainly does not force upon us. Moreover, as already observed, the aspect of forcible impetus which, under that interpretation, would claim both members of the first distich, is alien to the comparison drawn in the second, where no severe measures, but only protective and sustaining ones, characte- rise the leading and guiding providence of Yah weh over the forty years' progress through the desert. Again, if the sense of the whole quatrain seems to justify Dri- ver's preference for « hovereth », the same evidence further points to a hovering in flight above the young in motion, rather than « hovering » in the less exact sense of « brooding » over the mo- tionless young, or incubating the eggs, by immediate bodily contact. With the Babylonian Talmud (4) we should understand « like a dove that is hovering over her offspring without touching them ». From the influence of the homogeneous Syriac verb the notion of « incu- bating » was very early imported into the Hebrew participle in Gen. 1, 2, as Jerome himself reveals (2). Incubation, however, is only a derivative meaning of the Syriac rahef' and, as Eduard König observes (3), the interpretation of Semitic roots by the transfer of a particularized meaning from one language to another is a method often fruitful of misleading conclusions. At all events, if the Hebrew expression in Gen. 1, 2 is best explained by its counterpart in Deut. 32, 11, the latter does not picture the providence of Yahweh as shel- tering or cherishing its object in a state of rest, but decidedly as guiding and supporting it in progressive motion (see v. 10). So far, therefore, as the passage in Deuteronomy can guide us, it seems most probable that neither « brooding » over a quiescent offspring nor « raging » against its inertness, is the idea conveyed by yerahef ' but rather « hovering » above as leader, guide, and pro- (*) Hagigah II, i, foi. 15a.

To apply this very meaning to rrfrakefeth would seem to result in a most appropriate sense. In the beginning God had creat- ed matter. At a later point of time, not determined except as a prelude to the Hexaëmeron, this matter was still in an orderless and unproductive condition. But the chaos was no ruin abandoned by its Maker; it marked a transient stage in His own deliberate method. For together with the formless and barren orb and the darkness that as yet enveloped it, there was still and always « the spirit of God hovering above the surface of the waters » to claim the creation as His in every step of its development, and even to impart vitality itself, at the right moment, to every creature destined to enjoy the gift of life.
