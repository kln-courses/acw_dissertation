<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER SLAJE NÂSTIDATVE PRABHUTVAM TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT The present investigation1 is being carried out with a view to establishing a point of reference for a wider study of what M. Hulin has called "the famous Daiva versus Purusakàra controversy"2 with regard to the Yogavâsistha. The close link between a text-piece (XIII, 6) in the Epic Mahâbhârata - treating of the relative power of 'divine' (daiva) and 'human activity' (purusakàra) and introduced as a Vasistha Brahmâ Samvâda (2cd) - and several Sargas of the 2nd Prakarana (Mumuksuvyavahàra [MT II]) of the 'Yoga-Vasistha' (II 4, 8-10, 3), as the work is commonly called,3 can now certainly be regarded as beyond doubt. The credit, however, of having clearly shown the Yogavâsistha's dependence on the Epic piece goes entirely to T.G. Mainkar,4 who rightly dismissed Atreya's (1936) wrong assumption of a common ancient source from which both the works would have derived their particular ideas of the question under consideration. The textual interrelation thus being solved, the matter was recently taken up again, this time from the conceptual point of view, by Chr. Chappie (1986) and M. Hulin (1995). Chappie's translation of the relevant pieces of both the texts and his study based upon them abound in misunderstandings and - consequently - misrepresentations.5 M. Hulin, on the other hand, treated mainly of the developed concepts as they appear in the Yogavâsistha itself, only cursorily referring to the Mahâbhârata. If, however, a historical profile of these ideas is to be established, it is naturally on the Mahâbhârata as the Yogavâsistiia's 'source of inspiration' that we will first of all have to focus. This is the intention of what follows, namely to investigate MBh XIII, 6 qua text in its own right,6 presupposing it was built to hand down a message7 and accordingly trying to understand the teaching(s) incorporated. The results of this study - which offers nothing more than an attempt at a translation succinctly commented upon - are intended to serve as a basis for a further investigation into the Yogavâsistha's particular treatment of the concepts of 'fate' and 'effort'. A translation of the relevant parts in the Yogavâsistha, where these particular concepts are developed from a philosophico-soteriological point of view, will Journal of Indian Philosophy 26: 27-50, 1998. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

OVERVIEW OF THE CONTENTS I. Frame-story of the redactor, opening (1-2). II. The Itihâsa (3-47). Introduction (3-4). Interpolation (of the redactor)? Equal power of daiva and purusakâra (5-8). Main part (9-47) 1. Indispensability of action; human activity is superior to divine power (9-20). 2. Relative weakness of divine power; the gods' withdrawal from human beings' matters. III. Frame-story of the redactor, closing (48-49). TEXT AND TRANSLATION OF MAHÂBHÀRATA XIII, 6 I. (1-2) Opening of a frame: an Itihâsa announced. These first two slokas (1-2) together with the final two (48-49) constitute the frame composed by a redactor, who embedded the text(s) pertaining to the subject in between. Slokas 1-2 announce the Itihâsa, 48-49 represent the redactor's decision with regard to the matter. Yudhisthira uvâca pitâmaha mahâprâjha sarvasâstravisârada | daive purusakâre ca kim svic chresthataram bhavet 11111 • cd: appears as paraphrasing 3ab of the Itihâsa proper. Yudhisthira asked: (1) "Very wise grandfather, [you are] conversant with all (religious and scientific) treatises: with reference to 'divine [power]' / [(on) 'fate'] (daiva) and 'human activity' (purusakâra)8 - which one then (kim svid) was / [(or:) could (kim) one indeed (svid) be] superior [to the other]?"</page><page sequence="3">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 29 • c: daiva - in the light of the redactor's concluding statements (48 49), daiva as used here by him in his introductory part may very well have the meaning of 'fate' in an abstract and broader sense than the decidedly narrower meaning it has in the Itihâsa itself, namely of an actual 'power of divine beings' only. d: kim svid - the use of these two particles allows here for an interpre tation of both types of interrogations, putting either the whole sentence or merely one element in question. Bhïsma uvâca atrâpy udâharantïmam itihâsam purâtanam | vasisthasya ca samvâdam brahmanas ca yudhisthira ||2|| Bhïsma answered: (2) "On this [issue] also they cite an old legend as an illustration to follow, Yudhisthira, a conversation between [the sage] Vasistha and [god] Brahma. • ab: atrâpy ... - this is the most frequent phase in the Mbh never shared by the Râmâyana. According to an investigation carried out by M. Hara (1993/94: 165ff), "this phrase introduces a dialogue (samvâda), or ... a story that happened in the past (yad ... vrttam), with the intention of illustrating the point of discussion. It is to be noted that this phrase never introduces so-called episodes (upâkhyâna)... ". Since the Anusâsanaparvan contains numerous samvâdas, api should be taken as a connecting particle meaning 'also', but not as an emphatic one, the meaning of which was "on this very [issue]". II. (3-4) The Itihâsa. A (mythical) introduction (3-4) provides the scene and takes up the topic: superiority of 'divine' (daiva) or of 'human' (mânusa) activity (karman)! Attention has to be drawn to the fact that it is action/activity (karman), which is spoken of already right from the beginning of the Itihâsa. It matters indeed - and should therefore be kept in mind - that the following discussion focusses above all on this basic question of whether or not, of how and to what degree, influence could be exercised upon human beings and their affairs by divine beings. daivamânusayoh kim svit karmanoh srestham ity uta | purâ vasistho bhagavan pitâmaham aprcchata j|3|| (3) "Of divine and human action, which one then (kim svid) was / [(or:) could (kim) one indeed (svid) be] superior [to the other]?" Thus</page><page sequence="4">30 WALTER SLAJE in former times the question was put by the noble Vasistha to the Grandfather [Brahma]. • ab: cp. led. tatah padmodbhavo râjan devadevah pitâmahah | uvâca madhuram vâkyam arthavad dhetubhûsitam ||4|| (4) Thereupon, oh king, the Grandfather, lotus-bom lord of the gods, spoke pleasant words, meaningful [since] adorned with reason: (5-8) 'Divine [power]' (daiva) and 'human activity* (purusakâra) are taught to be equally required to produce results. Metaphor of 'field' and 'seed' for 'human activity' {purusakâra - ksetra) and 'divine [power]' (daiva = bïja) respectively. One may wonder which picture the author must have had in mind. The simile presents natural, perceivable facts explaining non-perceivable interactions between the power of divine and human beings. The metaphor of a field for human activity, however, rather conveys the idea of passivity. Should we assume the metaphor of seed (for daiva) was employed evocative of that which comes from the heavenly sphere above, as fertilizing rain or seed, down to the earthly region of human beings and exercising influence upon them? What follows rather fits the view-point of the redactor as expressed in the concluding passage of the frame (49), but has hardly anything in common with the argument and doctrine of the main part (9-47). I therefore hesitate to regard the following part (5-8) as genuine, for it gives one the impression of having only secondarily been added - or rather interpolated. Cp. the remarks on 8. (5-8) Arguments for the superiority of seed (i.e. daiva): nàbïjam jâyate kim cin, na bïjena vinâ phalam \ bïjâd bïjam prabhavati, bïjâd eva phalam smrtam ||5|| [Brahmâ:] (5) "Nothing whatsoever is produced without a seed: [there is] no fruit without a seed. Seed springs up from seed, from seed alone the fruit - [thus we] remember it traditionally. yâdrsam vapate bïjam ksetram âsâdya karsakah j sukrte duskrte vâpi, tâdrsam labhate phalam ||6|| • be: ksetram âsâdya - taken as a periphrastic expression of a locative case-relation9 ("on"), *ksetre (loc.) may be supplemented as the oth erwise missing subject for the two predicates sukrte duskrte occurring in an absolute construction in c.</page><page sequence="5">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATÎON IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 31 (6) What kind of seed the ploughman scatters on the field, - well prepared or badly - that kind of fruit will he obtain. • c: predicative of 'the field', which should be regarded as the subject of the absolute locative. The sentence becomes thus also contextually meaningful, for in 8a, which explains the metaphor, the field is likened to 'human activity' {purusakâra). A double entendre - alluding to puryya (sukrta) and papa (duskrta) - is therefore inherent as well: good field/good deed etc. cd: Seed is said to determine the species only, regardless of the field's condition, meaning regardless of the particular mode of action, 'human activity' will definitely bear some fruit. (7) Arguments for the superiority of field (i.e. paurusa): yathà bîjam vinâ ksetram uptam bhavati nisphalam | tatha purusakàrena vinâ daivam na sidhyati ||7|| (7) Just as seed will be fruitlessly sown without a field, so 'divine [power]' will not succeed without 'human activity'. (8) Conclusion: United they become effective. It should be borne in mind that the conclusion arrived at here in 8 basically meets the opinion of the redactor as expressed in 49. This particular view-point as well as the simile as such set this passage (5-8) somehow apart from the rest of the Itihàsa (9-47), where the matter is presented differently. ksetram purusakaras tu, daivam bïjam udâhrtam | ksetrabïjasamâyogât tatah sasyam samrdhyate ||8|| (8) The 'field', however, [denotes here] 'human activity', the 'seed' is spoken of [meaning] 'divine [power]'. Caused by this union of 'field' and 'seed' the crop will grow successfully. (9-20) Human activity as the indispensable means to success. (9-1 Ob) Now introducing the concept of an appropriate fruition of human activity (karman = purusakâra), which at the same time conveys the idea of retributive causality (karman) with an ethical orientation: karmanah phalanirvrttim svayam asnâti kârakah | pratyaksam drsyate loke, krtasyâpy akrtasya ca ||9|| (9) [Only] he who acts, will himself experience the resulting fruition of [his] activities - of good (krta) and of bad ones (akrta) - as is directly perceived in the world. • d: krta and akrta are contextually embedded in between su-lduskrta of 6c and subha/pàpa karman of the line to follow. The same meaning of 'good' and 'bad' will appear again in 28 (cp. the note).</page><page sequence="6">32 WALTER SLAJE subhena karmana saukhyam, duhkham papena karmana | (lOab) Pure action [brings forth] happiness. Suffering [comes] from evil action. • ab: The terms subhaJasubha - as well as puny a!papa (cp. 29ff) - have always been closely connected in meaning to karman understood as retributive causality. According to M. Hara10 subha can lead to svarga (cp. also 13f: achieving a god's position) and apavarga, asubha to tiryaktva and naraka. (10c-15) The means to success is to carry out appropriate activities: the position achieved by the foregoing argument, i.e. a necessary union of 'divine [power]' and 'human activity', may - according to the arrangement of the slokas - be seen as now serving to provide a starting-point for the obvious shift to stress the importance of 'human activity' alone. For the emphasis of the following is clearly put on actually carrying out (notable frequent use of derivations from y/kr) one's activities (karman) to bring results to fruition. From lOcd to 27 the terms krtaJakrta demonstrably bear the meaning of 'carrying/not carrying out (activities)'. krtam sarvatra labhate, nâkrtam bhujyate kva cit ||10|| (lOcd) In every respect [of good or bad deeds, however, only] what has been carried out is obtained [as a result]. Undone will not - by any means - ever be experienced. • cd: Formulation of two basic principles of the theory of karman, namely that it was impossible to experience the results of actions not done by oneself (akrtâbhyâgama), and that it was equally impossible that past deeds would not exercise an effect (krtavipranasa)11. The same meaning of krtraJakrta is - apart from the next line - also supported by e.g. 15d (akrtakarman), 17c (akarmasTla), 20a (akrtvâ manusam karma), 22a (krtah purusakàrah). krtT sarvatra labhate pratisthâm bhâgy aviksatah \ akrtTlabhate bhrastah ksate ksârâvasecanam ||11|| (11) [Only] he who acts obtains stability in every respect, unhurt will he partake of [the results]. Brought to ruin does he, who does not take to activity, [only] achieve that salt be sprinkled in [his] wound. tapasâ rûpasaubhàgyam ratnâni vividhâni ca | prâpyate karmana sarvam, na daivâd akrtâtmanâ ||12||</page><page sequence="7">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 33 (12) Through '[the practice of] austerity' a beautiful appearance and success [will be obtained in another birth], manifold jewels, too. Everything can be accomplished by [one's] activities, [but] nothing [will be obtained] from 'divine [power]', [human] inactivity by itself. • a: tapas = dharma = sukrta/punya, following Hara (1986: 54, n. 44 for further references). Merit was conceived of as an omnipotent subtle substance which could be stored up, but was at the same time subject to decay and loss12 (Hara, 1967/68: 388ff, 396f; Hara, 1970: 62f; Hara, 1994: 1 lOff, 115f; on merit transfer cp. also Agasse, 1978); rûpasaubhâgya interpreted as a Samâhâradvandva compound, though a Tatpurusa cannot be excluded. a-c: Introducing his quote of MBh XII 149, 32, Hara (1970: 58) remarks: "It is also said that all worldly possessions, such as gold, jewels and off-spring, are based upon tapas". d: If one hesitates to accept this compounded reflexive in a construction with daiva,n another meaningful solution should be offered. The only one I can see at the moment is to take akrtâtman as a Bahuvnhi 0 compound, the subject of which must, however, be supplemented: ~ "by someone, whose self is inactivity". This would correspond with krtin in 11a or akarmasïla in 17c. For a similar use of akrtâtman as o 0 a Bahuvnhi (aprâpyam akrtâtmabhih, MBh XIII 28, 26d) cp. Hara, 1975: 134. (13-14) Enumeration of what a krtin may achieve by his activities (purusakara): tathâ svargas ca bhogas ca nisthà yâ ca manïsitâ | sarvam purusakârena krtenehopapadyate ||13|j (13) In the same way heaven, enjoyment, a coveted position - everything will be brought about by 'human activity' [if only it is] carried out here [in this region of Bharatavarsa]. • a: tathâ - meaning to say "by carrying out activities", refers to 12c. d: iha in my opinion stresses the fact that the only opportunity to exercise influence upon one's own future existence must be taken during the present human existence, as reborn in Bharatavarsa. As to the idea of Bharatavarsa as the only region where actions come to fruition due to the future effects of retributive causality, and where such results can also successfully be neutralized by human beings, cp. Hara, 1986: 52 f (n. 39 for further literature).</page><page sequence="8">34 WALTER SLAJE jyotïmsi tridasâ nâgâ yaksâs candrârkamârutâh \ sarve purusakârena mânusyâd devatâm gatâh ||14|| (14) The heavenly bodies, the Thirty [gods], [beings such as] Nâgas [and] Yaksas, the sun and the moon, and the god of wind - [they] all - [setting out] from a human position - became divinities by [having taken to] 'human activity'. • d: devatâ as used here obviously encomprises numerous kinds of beings, not only 'gods' of an anthropomorphic shape. It seems that any 'divine position', i.e. any position 'above' the world of the human beings was spoken of as 'divine'. Deva and its derivations should therefore - in the context of MBh XIII,6 at least - rather be taken as a semantically broad term. This observation might probably also serve as a clue to explaining the more generally recognised meaning of daiva as limited to the influential power of stars, if one compares e.g. daiva-jna ~ 'astrologer'. For an interesting remark of Nïlakantha's on the divine character of heavenly bodies cp. below, 23b. (15) No achievement by someone who abstains from action: artho va mitravargo vâ aisvaryam vâ kulânvitam | s'rïs câpi durlabhâ bhoktum tathaivâkrtakarmabhih ||15|| (15) Wealth, a host of friends, the power of a noble family, and glory, too, are similarly difficult to experience for those, who do not carry out [their] activities. • d: akrtakarmabhih - cp. lOd, 12d, 17c. (16-18): No success without appropriate activities: saucena labhate viprah, ksatriyo vikramena ca | vaisyah purusakârena, sûdrah susrûsayâ, sriyam ||16|| (16) A Brahmin obtains [his] welfare by [observing] purity, and a Ksatriya by [fighting with] valour, the Vaiéya through [his] labour (purusakâra), the Sudra by paying service [to the first three varnas\. • c: purusakâra - probably used to stress the meaning of '(bodily) exertion'. It seems, however, unlikely that the class of the Vaisyas alone should have been said to exert themselves in the sense of 'paurusa versus daiva', as discussed in this text-piece. nâdâtâram bhajanty arthâ, na klTbam, nâpi niskriyam \ nâkarmasïlam, nâsùram, tathâ naivâtapasvinam ||17||</page><page sequence="9">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 35 (17) Neither he, who does not give, nor he, who is impotent, nor he, who does not sacrifice, will [ever] achieve the objects [intended by him], nor do the inactive, the coward, [and] in a similar way certainly not he, who does not 'practise austerities'. • a: (Acc.) bhajanty arthah - due to the different types of inactive people enumerated, among them also the klïba, I will not accept a meaning 'wealth falling to someone's (acc.) share'. It should rather be the achievement of an intended aim or purpose which is denied to the inactive. Similar transitive turns, where - from the European point of view - 'concrete' things or 'abstract' notions are construed as (grammatical) subjects approaching human beings etc. as their (gram matical) objects, occur e.g. also in 29cd, 45d. Such 'idiomatic turns' (Speijer, 1886: §42, rem. 2) should be seen against the substantialistic background of ancient Indian thought. b: klïba - rather 'impotent' than the more general meaning of 'weak'. This assumption is also strengthened by the use of the same word in 20d. c: akarmasïla - cp. the investigation of compounded -sîla nouns by Hara, 1986a: 22; 24; 32; 42. Cp. also the note on lOcd above, d: (a)tapasvin - the notion of '(not) being endowed with the [subtle] substance of tapas' presupposes of course that it has or has not been acquired by 'practising austerities'. Cp. also Hara (1970: 66), according to whom "tapas is, thus, stored up in one's body and enables the tapas possessor (tapo-dhana, tapasvin) to attain his desired objects". yena lokas trayah srstâ, daityâh, sarvâs ca devatâh | sa esa bhagavàn visnuh samudre tapyate tapah ||18|) (18) By whom the three worlds have been created, the Daityas and all [kinds of] divinities, the venerable Visnu himself takes to the 'practice of austerities' in the ocean. • b: devatâ - for the semantics of the term as used here cp. the remark on 14d above. d: For tapas y/tap (~ 'producing a powerful substance, i.e. merit, by the practice of austerities') cp. Hara, 1967/68: 391, fn. 5; Hara, 1970: 60; Shee, 1986: 189, 244, 342. (19-20) Arguments to strengthen the proposition that 'human activity' is indispensible to secure success in all undertakings, since otherwise people would never act, which, however, is not the case: svam cet karmaphalam na syât, sarvam evâphalam bhavet | loko daivam samàlambya udâsïno bhaven, na tu ||19||</page><page sequence="10">36 WALTER SLAJE (19) If there were no result of one's own activities, everything indeed would become futile. People - taking to 'divine [power]' [alone] - would be inactive. [That], however, [is] not [the case]. akrtvâ mânusam karma yo daivam anuvartate | vrthà sràmyati samprâpya patim klïbam ivâhganà ||20|| (20) He who relies on 'divine [power]' without taking to human action, [is] like a woman [who] - with an impotent husband - 'gets tired'/makes efforts in vain. • a: cp. note on lOcd. cd: Since relying on daiva implies abstaining from activities, the simile should be expected to convey meanings such as 'becoming weakened' or 'getting tired', but hardly of 'exhausting oneself'. (21-47) The relative weakness of the power of all divinities. (21-27) Shift to the relative weakness of the 'gods' [power]', who either are not able or else are not willing to interfere with human beings' matters (any longer?). The fact that the veiy term daiva does occur here in a context of the '(influential) sphere of gods' makes it clear how this concept's connotation was originally understood, namely strictly according to its etymology, i.e. as 'divine [power]'/'power belonging to divinities'.14 The concept of de va appears here as encomprising not only anthropomorphically shaped divine beings, but also heavenly bodies (cf. above, 14; 18; below 23). Therefore an early and etymologically close understanding of daiva seems to prevail. As such it must be regarded different from the general concept of 'fate' bearing an abstract and rather general character. With respect to the history of Indian religions we are concerned here with an important testimony to the heavenly beings' gradual deprivation of power. They increasingly withdraw from wordly affairs: na tathâ mânuse loke bhayam asti, subhâsubhe \ yathâ tridasaloke hi bhayam alpena jay ate |J21|| • b: subhâsubhe - Samâhâradvandva construed as an absolute locative without auxiliary [Speijer, 1886: §367], cp. also the notes on 6a-c, 9d-10b. A direct construction with bhaya would, however, require the use of an ablative [Speijer, 1886: §97, 3]. (21) Given pure and impure [activities], in the human world no such a [terrible] fear [of their results] prevails, as in the world of the Thirty [gods, where] the fear [of retributive results] arises [even] at the slightest [occasion of activity].</page><page sequence="11">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 37 • cd: This introduces - or rather: anticipates - 23fF, where the divinities' permanent fear of losing the highest, i.e. their divine, position (sthàna), won by making hard efforts (cf. 14), is spoken of. At the same time the idea is being expressed that the life of gods should not be considered that happy as the general belief would have it. krtah purusakaras tu, daivam evânuvartate | na daivam, akrte, kim cit kasya cid datum arhati ||22|| • a: krtah purusakàrah - in the light of the use of the absolute locative in pâda c) (akrte [purusakàre]) and - above all - for contextual rea sons, krtah purusakàrah in pâda a) should be taken as a rare instance of a nominative in absolute construction, cp. e.g. Oertel, 1926: 39ff. If the nominative was, however, considered the grammatical sub ject of anuvartate, it would contradict the broader and the narrowest context (cd) as well: ~ "activity, having been carried out, relies on daiva", which is improbable. For similar ideas (ab:) cp. 47cd; (cd:) cp. 24ab. (22) If, however, a 'human activity' has been carried out, 'divine [power]' will itself rely on ['human activity']. If, [on the other hand], no ['human activity'] has been carried out, 'divine [power]' is incapable of procuring anything for anyone. • a: cp. note on lOcd. yadâ sthànàny anityâni drsyante daivatesv api | katham karma vinà daivam sthâsyate sthàpayisyati ||23|| (23) Since [apparently firm] positions are perceived as impermanent even among 'divine beings', [then] how will [their] 'divine [power]' be maintained without activity, [and how] will ['divine power' without taking to activity] maintain [the gods' positions]? • A remark of Nïlakantha's is revealing, especially as compared to what Hopkins (1915: 74)15 has to say in this regard. Nïlakantha, however, explains this perception as "the downfall of the gods in their shape of heavenly bodies" (tàràrûpinàm devânàm adhahpâtadarsanàd ...). This does not only testify to the actual identification of heavenly bodies with particular divine positions or 'divinities', but also to the belief that the loss of such a position may result in the factual downfall of the body from heaven to earth, the occurrence of which can be observed as a natural phenomenon we are used to call a 'shooting star'. Thus the belief in the 'power of the stars' may probably be also traced back to the opinion that heavenly bodies are nothing more than a particular group among the class of devas, cp. above, 14; 18.</page><page sequence="12">38 WALTER SLAJE na daivatàni loke 'smin vyâpâram yânti kasya cit | vyasangam janayanty ugram âtmâbhibhavasahkayâ ||24|| (24) The divinities are not concerned about / [(or) do not exert themselves for] the benefit of anyone in this [human] world [of ours]. Scared about becoming subjugated themselves, they create considerable detachment [from human affairs]. • d: Should we suppose they were considered being afraid of becoming subjugated by the Rsis?16 The following lines, however, clearly touch upon their enmity, which is explained by Nllakantha in the following manner: rsïnâm tapasi devâ vighnam âcaranti, rsayas cyavanâdaya indrâdinam abhibhavam kurvantiti saukanye prasiddham. This meets basically the results of M. Hara's investigations (1975), according to which it was Indra, who "is often depicted as afraid that the tapas of the ascetics might dethrone him" (p. 130). The Itihâsa here under consideration speaks, however, about the whole class of fearful divinities. The quotation of MBh 165,21a-c by Hara (1975: 136) is telling, above all when compared to the context of 23-24. It runs: tapasâ dïptavïryo 'yam sthànân mâm cyâvayed iti, bhîtah puramdaras ... The Rsis' power was due to their practice of tapas, through which they were thought to accumulate a powerful substance which was lost by cursing, through wrath, or by emitting seed.17 Their power thus having diminished in quantity had to be be restored again by further practice of tapas.™ rsïnâm devatânâm ca sada bhavati vigrahah \ "kasya vàcâ hy adaivam syâd, yato daivam pravartate ||25|| katham câsya samutpattir, yato daivam pravartate" | evam tridasaloke 'pi prâpyante bahavas chalâh ||26|| • 26b: yato daivam - v. 1. preferred to the C.E's established reading yathâ daivam. Since the term chala in d is most probably used here in the technical sense it has in debates, a series of phonemes that sound alike, deliberately causing misunderstandings, can be expected, cp. TSI (II), sub voce. (25) And [thus] there is a permanent quarrel between the Rsis and the divine beings: [The Devas:] "By whose proposition, then, should there exist something [which is/has] no 'divine [power]' (adaiva), from which - [according to your opinion] - 'divine [power' would] come forth? (26) And how [should] this, [which is/has no 'divine power'], come [itself] into existence? [From that,] from which 'divine [power]' comes forth?" Thus even in the world of the Thirty [gods] many tricky debates are met with.</page><page sequence="13">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 39 • I do not claim to have properly understood the argument. There are of course many more possibilities of constructing more or less meaningful sentences, among them e.g. trying to read the odd pâdas (25c, 26a) as questions and the even ones (25d, 26b) as answers. Or else, we might as well read 'daivam instead of daivam in 26b. For depending on the different meanings two opponents may attribute to one and the same word used during a dispute, or rather to a series of phonemes that sound like that (daiva or 'daiva), the meaning of the sentence will become unclear, causing perplexity, which was the proper function of a chala. One thing, however, seems to be certain, namely that adaiva as the negation or opposite of daiva must be regarded as connected with or bearing the meaning of the Rsis' purusakâra, i.e. their activity. To recognize the chala inherent in the text as I understand it, one has to interpret yatah (in 25d and 26b) not only as relative pronoun expressing the cause of origin (as translated), but also in the sense of denoting the reason in answering each of the foregoing pâdas, which in this case should be regarded as rhetorical questions: "By whose proposition, then, should there exist something [which is/has] no 'divine [power]' (adaiva)! For it is 'divine [power' alone, which] is active!" - "And how [should] this, [which is/has no 'divine power'], come [at all] into existence? For it is 'divine [power' alone, which] is active!" Accordingly, worldly influence is completely denied to 'divine [power]': âtmaiva hy âtmano bandhur, âtmaiva ripur âtmanah | àtmaiva càtmanah sâksï krtasyâpy akrtasya ca ||27|| (27) For oneself alone is one's own friend, [and] oneself alone is one's own foe. And oneself alone is one's own witness, of what [one] has done, and of what [one] has refrained from doing. • c: àtmaiva ... sâksï - compare that to the general belief of the gods' function as a witness (sàksin) to human acts, e.g. to oaths and their fulfillment, or - well known - Agni as a witness to the marriage act. d: krtasyâpy akrtasya - it appears that the concepts of sukrta/punya and of duskrta/pâpa are equally present, cp. above 9-10ab and the following topic, which is introduced at the same time. (28-29) Attempt at 'ethicizing' human activities by putting the concepts of merit and demerit in the foreground: the power of 'human activity' with special reference to the production of merit (sukrta/punya) is regarded more influential than accumulated demerit (duskrta/pâpa). Consequently, sukrta can impede duskrta in causing an effect. Human beings would thus not depend on 'divine [power]' - which in later</page><page sequence="14">40 WALTER SLAJE times will appear again prominently as 'divine grace' - to intervene for their benefit: krtam ca vikrtam kim cit, krte karmani, sidhyati I o 0 o * ^ 1 sukrte, duskrtam karma na yathârtham prapadyate ||28|| (28) Provided that an activity has been carried out [accordingly], anything [rightly] done and wrongly done will come to [appropriate] fruition. If, [however an action] was rightly done, an action [already] wrongly done will not come to fruition appropriately. • a: krta, vikrta - used in the meaning of su/duskrta (as in d), which becomes clear from the absolute locative in b (krte karmani), where krta expresses the prerequisite for accumulations of both kinds, namely 'having actually carried out activities', cp. also 46cd. There, however, vikarman appears in the sense of 'inactive', not of 'wrongly acting', c: sukrta, duskrta - were conceived of as substances accompanying a soul after its death and producing good results in another birth, cp. also the note on 12. Therefore by su-lduskrta not only the activities leading to them, but also the (substantial) good or bad results produced by them, should be understood. Even the gods seek shelter through their meritorious deeds (punya), which provide for everything. If this were indeed the case, punya, which is automatically accumulated by appropriate activities (karman, purusakârà), must be regarded as no less powerful a means for human beings as well, and consequently even fit for overcoming the gods' 'divine [power]': devânàm saranam punyam, sarvam punyair avâpyate \ punyasïlam naram prâpya kim daivam prakarisyati ||29|| (29) Merit is the shelter of [even] the gods. Everything can be obtained by merit. Will 'divine [power]' be able to act against a man devoted to [the acquisiton of] merit? • a: punya - for 'merit' cp. above, notes on 12 and 28 and Filliozat 1980:107,110,116. cd: punyasTla - translation according to Hara (1986a: 31ff): "sTla is essentially neutral as far as its meaning is concerned. It simply means the nature (svabhàva, or habitual character ... one can render -sTla with moral and religious concepts ... as "devoted to" ...

They will be skipped over since they do not substantially contribute to, but simply exemplify the argu ment. The 'historical events', which are only alluded to, are being presented with a view to proving that deeds, meritorious as well as bad ones, when only executed with sufficient effort {purusakàra), are decidedly more powerful than the rather weak 'divine [power]' (daiva) of divine beings (daivata). In order to convey an impression, the first (30) and the last instance (40) of this set of examples is given: purâ yayàtir vibhrastas cyâvitah patitah ksitau | punar dropitah svargam dauhitraih punyakarmabhih ||30|| (30) In former times Yayâti,19 who had failed [in heaven], was thrown out [by the gods and] fell down on earth. By meritorious acts of his daughter's sons, [however], he was raised again to heaven. (31-39) ... pàndavànàm hrtam râjyam dhàrtarâstrair mahdbalaih \ punah pratyahrtam caiva na daivdd, bhujasamsraydt ||40|| (40) The kingdom of the Pândavas taken away by the mighty Dhârtarâstras was certainly not regained again by 'divine [power]', [but rather] because [the Pândavas] resorted to [the strength of their] arms. (41-42) 'Divine [power]', unable to exercise influence upon retributive causality (karman) (42), is therefore regarded as less effective than 'human action' of any kind, the only means to accumulate powerful karmic substances. That daiva can never successfully intervene is spoken of in 41 (meritorious acts of the Rsis) and in 42 (wrongly acting, wicked people): taponiyamasamyuktà munayah samsitavratàh | kim te daivabalâc chdpam utsrjante, na karmanâ ||41|| (41) The sages, endowed with austerities and self-restrictions, firmly adhering to [their] vows, do they perhaps utter [their] curse[s] through 'divine power', or rather by an activity [of their own]? • c: sapa - for the substantial, unfailing nature of a curse - the Brahmins' weapons (vdg-astra) - produced by tapas, cp. Hara, 1970: 67f, 71; 1975: 156f. Since acquisition of tapas is characteristic of a Rsi's activity, it is in fact a particular kind of purusakàra which is spoken of here. pdpam utsrjate loke sarvam pràpya sudurlabham | lobhamohasamapannam na daivam trâyate naram ||42|| (42) ['Divine power]' leaves the wicked man after having bestowed upon him everything [that is] really hard to obtain in this world.</page><page sequence="16">42 WALTER SLAJE 'Divine [power]' cannot rescue [such] a man full of desire and delusion. • ab: papa - implies of course that the person under consideration is characterized by an accumulation of demerit. The grammatical subject of utsrjate and prâpya (gerund of the causative stem) must be supplied from pâda d (daivam). As in 28-29, here also the opinion seems to prevail that contrary to sukrta produced by appropriate 'human activities', daiva itself was unable to counteract accumulated duskrta. • o (43-45) If 'divine [power]' was effective at all, then only as being dependent on 'human activity': yathâgnih pavanoddhûtah sûksmo 'pi bhavate mahân | tatha karmasamayuktam daivam sâdhu vivardhate | j 4311 (43) As fire of even a subtle state becomes large when fanned by wind, so 'divine [power]' steadily increases when conjoined with [human] activity. • b: sUksma - supposedly 'fire' as hidden in glowing ashes is alluded to. yathâ tailaksayâd dïpah pramlânim upagacchati | tatha karmaksayâd daivam pramlânim upagacchati j [44| j (44) As a flame fades away when it runs out of oil, so 'divine [power]' fades away when it runs out of [human] activity. vipulam api dhanaugham prâpya, bhogân, striyo va, purusa iha na saktah, karmahlno hi, bhoktum j sunihitam api cârtham daivatai raksyamânam, vyayagunam api sadhum karmanâ samsrayante 1145 [ | • a-c: my construction runs: api (a) ... na saktah (b) ... api ca [na saktah] (c). b: hi (causal) - v.l. against the C.

They [all] will [, however, constantly] approach the one meritorious by [his] activities - even if he [constantly] spends all [of his wealth]. • d: karmanâ - if construed with the predicate samsrayante, the meaning was: "... approach him through/caused by his activities". In my opinion,</page><page sequence="17">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOG1SATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 43 however, it is his karman which qualifies him as a sâdhu, and therefore: karmanâ sàdhuh. sams'rayante - the grammatical subject has been changed, the riches and other objects of enjoyment are thought and spoken of as approaching the person. For this turn cp. the note on 17a. (46-47) The final stroke against daiva: the gods have drawn back from worldy affairs, their divine influence has become a very feeble one on earth, to say the least. In fact, it neither can cause good results, nor prevent a person from experiencing evil results caused by own deeds (cp. also 42). It appears also that the original connotation of daiva ('divine', [the power] belonging to divine beings) due to its etymological derivation from deva, and as such still present in this 'old Itihâsa', has been felt to gradually losing this meaning, giving room to broader concepts of a 'fate' not necessarily connected with anthropomorphically shaped heavenly beings, the devas proper. If we take into consideration, however, that heavenly bodies such as the stars etc., were also considered a group among the devas, the matter and the question of a semantic change would present themselves in a slightly different manner. Viewed from the background of the more general and certainly also more common idea according to which the gods were represented in human shape (cp. e.g. how their relationship with worldly matters is described in 46bc), the following may read as reflecting the particular shift in the meaning of daiva: bhavati manujalokad devaloko visisto bahutarasusamrddhyâ, manusânâm grhâni \ pitrvanàbham drsyate câmarânàm, na ca phalati vikarmà jïvaloke, na daivam ||46|| yyapanayati vimârgam, nàsti daive prabhutvam gurum iva krtam agryam karma samyâti daivam | anupahatam adînam kàmakârena daivam nayati purusakârah samcitas tatra tatra 114711 • 46c: pitrvanàbham - the concord of the singular with the plural grhâni appears to be an Epic 'licence', as it is often met with in Epic texts. 46d: jïvaloke, na - note that the text as printed in the Critical Edition reads jïvalokena. The context requires, however, to split it up as done above. In my opinion, na daivam (d) should be construed with 47a) as shown by the translation. (46) The world of the gods is indeed distinguished from the world of the humans by exceedingly more abundance. And [therefore] the habitations of men to the immortals resemble 'ancestral groves'.</page><page sequence="18">44 WALTER SLAJE In the world of the living, however, no one succeeds who abstains from actions. 'Divine [power]' [can] not (47) lead someone [bent] on evil course away. There is no power in the 'divine'. 'Divine [power]' [thus respectfully] goes to meet action as if it had been made (krta) its foremost teacher. [And as a teacher does with his pupil, will] accumulated 'human activity' unrestrictedly [and] cheerfully lead 'divine [power]' here and there at will. • 46a: "indeed" - emphatic position of the predicate bhavati. 47b: prabhutvam - Hopkins (1906: 586) understands "determining power", which seems a bit too narrow in sense. The statement appears rather generalized. 47d: samcitah - the results in consequence of human effort. III. (48-49) Closing of the redactor's frame which has been opened through 1-2. The question of the relative strength of daiva and purusakdra is no more discussed. Both of the forces are now repre sented as equally required to secure success and as equally exercising influence on human undertakings, cp. the remarks on 8. Note that the redactor also introduces a term not used in the Itihâsa proper, i.e. vidhi, to replace daiva (49c): état te sarvam âkhyâtam maya vai munisattama | phalam purusakàrasya, sadâ samdrsya tattvatah ||48|| (48) Thus, most excellent sage [Yudhisthira], did I myself expound to you the entire fruit of 'human activity', adequately [as] I always perceived [it]. abhyutthânena daivasya, samârabdhena karmanâ \ vidhinâ karmanâ caiva, svargamârgam avâpnuyàt ||49|| (49) Through the [respectfully] rising of 'divine [power]', through activity [actually] undertaken, in fact by fate and action, can one be expected to reach the path to heaven. • a: abhyutthàna - obviously the metaphor of 47b is alluded to, here as the humbly rising of daiva in order to revere excellent 'human effort'. To sum up, MBh XIII, 6 (3-47), provides us with material testifying to an idea that clearly favours 'human activity' over 'divine power' with respect to the achievement of human aims, of course. Calling to mind P.V. Kane's scheme of threefold classification, according to which the Epics knew of three types of solution to the daiva-paurusa problem,</page><page sequence="19">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 45 this one would belong to the third type.20 The position of the redactor of MBh Xin 6, however, can easily be assigned to the second one. This second alternative of the Mahâbhârata, Kane's so-called "golden mean" between activity and fate, is also advocated in the Yâjnavalkya Dharmasâstra. There it is stated that success in all undertakings depends upon both fate and human activity.21 However, here in Mahâbhârata XIII 6, 'divine power' is still being treated as directly related to influence exercised by divine beings, whose ability or willingness to interfere with human matters is said to have diminished. Thus, this epic text-piece not only preserves a well-rounded picture of an important subject in terms of the history of Indian religions, namely the declining belief or trust in the power of gods, but also proves that the question, whether and to what degree man could overpower his 'destiny' by resorting to his own efforts, had - by some thinkers at least - indeed been decided in favour of man. This, however, does not mean that the existence of divine beings would have been denied - such a kind of 'demythologisation' cannot be expected from a culture whose gods are considered mere members of a particular group of beings holding only a time-limited - though generally powerful - position. What we meet with here is by far more important, in that the gods appear as becoming radically deprived of power in the world and in that their factual inability to intervene is being proclaimed as a result. It will suffice simply to call attention to the importance of the worldly interaction of benevolent or malevolent divine beings in Vedic times as well as the soteriological, etc. function of the Hindu triad of later times — especially in contexts of bhakti - to make one immediately recognise the dimension of our author's outstanding concept. This again makes the Epic passage under consideration also important for the history of Indian philosophy, as it touches upon the question of 'free-will', a concept whose occurrence in ancient India has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Taking into account that the neutralization of retributive causality (karman) and the fulfilling of human life-aims (purusârtha)22 were thought to be achievable only in Bhâratavarsa (karmabhumi), and this exclusively by human beings (purusa/mânusya),23 the idea of actually counteracting divine, superhuman or even karmic powers by human activities (purusakâra), as presented in the MBh (XIII, 6) and further developed in the Yogavâsistha from its own philosophical view-point, certainly deserves an investigation. Being already under preparation by the present author, such an investigation will also have to deal with another important feature inherent in the Yogavâsistha's treatment of this particular topic 'emancipation from the divine'. In</page><page sequence="20">46 WALTER SLAJE fact, such an attempt to free oneself from the belief in the influences of almighty gods can no longer be overlooked in the Mahâbhârata. The Yogavâsistha, however, steps farther in that it - above all in its oldest layers - unmistakably declares human reason (vicâra) superior to divine revelation of any kind (srutilsmrti).24 The question commonly denied by historians, whether ideas ever occurred in ancient India that could be compared to those of Western 'Enlightenment', should therefore be taken up anew. NOTES * I am much indebted to Prof. Phyllis Granoff (Hamilton), Prof. Minora Hara (Tokyo) and Prof. Albrecht Wezler (Hamburg) for their substantial criticism and to PD Dr Thomas Oberlies (Freiburg/Br.) for some useful remarks. My sincere thanks to Prof. Granoff for her charmingly 'scribbling all over' earlier drafts and for correcting my English. 2 Hulin, 1995: 137. 3 As regards the textual development and change of its designation, cp., however, Slaje, 1994: 57-63. 4 Mainkar, 1977: 22-32. 5 De Jong (1988). 6 For previous attempts cp. O. Strauss (1911: 291/), T.G. Mainkar (1977: 22ff), and Chr. Chappie (1986: 59-64; 95-101). One wonders why the passage - despite its importance for the development of the idea of 'fate' so closely related to the term daiva - has entirely been neglected by Hopkins (1915), Chakravarty (1955), Satyavrat (1963), Long (1980), and Hill (1994). 7 This of course must not necessarily be the 'coherent' opinion of one individual author or thinker, for the 'message' may very well consist of several opinions the redactor of the text-piece had in mind when he, regarding them as equally true and therefore worthy of being handed down, simply put them in juxtaposition, as it often is the case with texts of the 'anonymous genre'. Cp. Hacker (1961). 8 For a short but illuminating sketch of the semantics of a frequently used synonym of purusakàra, namely paurusa, cp Hara, 1992: 186/. 9 Cp. Speijer, 1886: §203; Speyer, 1896: §93. 10 Hara, 1986: 53. 11 Cp. Halbfass, 1991: 292, 329, n. 5; Halbfass, 1995: 90. 12 However, the practice (asceticism) and possession (merit) of tapas seem to have been limited to the Brahmin caste only (Hara, 1970: 64, n. 25). 13 For reflexives not referring to the grammatical subject of the sentence, cp. Speijer, 1886: §267. 14 Cp. Strauss (1911: 23) who speaks of rare instances of the meaning of daiva, where the "Erinnerung an den Zusammenhang mit deva" has survived. Cp. also Hopkins (1915: 73), according to whom ".. .fate or destiny is a power developed into individuality out of the general concept of divine power ... 15 "That the divine power is sometimes analysed as the power of the stars may be suspected from the antithesis of 'natural philosophers' (bhûtacintakâh) and daivacintakâh as astrologers". 16 As to the differentiation between two types of sages, the so-called pravrtti ("active") and nivrtti- ("passive") rsis, cp. Strauss (1911): 197-217 (pravrtti), 247</page><page sequence="21">TRACES OF DEMYTHOLOGISATION IN INDIAN EPIC THOUGHT 47 284 (nivpti); the epic dispute that developed over it is dealt with on pp. 285ff. Cp. also Bailey, 1985; Hill (1994): 66ff. 17 On this cp. Hara, 1975: 131, 136# 18 Cp. e.g. Hara, 1994: 123; Hill (1994: 69, 72). On p. 75 Hill writes: "Their [i.e. the "Pravrtti sages"] determined amassing of tapas gave them a position of independence from the controlling effect of external forces, be these in the form of divine interference or impersonal deterministic forces such as fate and time The mythology of the pravrtti rsis amounts to an emphatic affirmation of the efficacy of human action". 19 For this story cp. Hara, 1967/68: 392; Hara, 1994: 110/. 20 Cp. HDh 3: 168/ The first one puts emphasis on fate as being all powerful. It is said that human effort was powerless against fate, e.g. MBh 179.27: daivam purusakdrena ko vancayitum arhati / daivam eva param manye purusartho nirarthakah // ("Who would escape fate by human activities? 1 believe fate alone to be foremost. Human activity is useless"). For variations of the same fatalistic notion in the Mahabharata and in the Ramayana, cp. Hara, 1993/94: 160. The second alternative advocates a "golden mean", teaching that worldly affairs require both effort and fate, e.g. MBh I 114.16ab: daive purusakare ca loko 'yam sampratisthitah / ("This world is established on fate and on human activity"). The third one suggests activity as being superior to fate, precisely as testified to in the main part of the present paper's translation. 21 Cp. YDhS I, 349-351: daive purusakare ca karmasiddhir vyavasthiiâ / tatra daivam abhivyaktam paurusam paurvadehikam // kecid daivât, svabhâvâd va, kâlât, purusakàratah / samyoge kecid icchanti phalam kusalabuddhayah II yalhâ hy ekena cakrena rathasya na gatir bhavet / evam purusakârena vinâ daivam na sidhyati II ("Success in actions depends upon fate and human activity. In reference to this, fate [is to be understood] as fully manifested human activity of a former body. Some prefer [to explain] an effect [as being caused] by fate, or by itself, [or] by time, [or else] by human activity. Those with a clever mind [prefer an explantion] with regard to a combination [of fate and human activity]. For as the movement of a chariot would not be possible with [only] one wheel, so fate cannot succeed without human activity"). The same idea, namely that both activity and fate are equally necessary to bring about a result, is adhered to by some other Dharma texts, such as e.g. Manu's (MDhâ VII, 205: sarvam karmedam âyattam vidhâne daivamânuse / tayor daivam acintyam tu, mânuse vidyate kriya II ("All the undertakings [in this world] depend both on the means of fate and human activity; among these two, fate, however, is unfathomable; [but] action [is seen] to exist for human activity"). Kullokabhatta remarkably explains this statement as showing a preference of paurusa to daiva, which he regards as an effect of human activities of former lives, thus ultimately being nothing but past purusakara. The Mitaksara explains the passage of YDhS quoted above in a similar way. The explanations of these commentaries are thus very close to the third alternative ("paurusa only") of the Epic. The same opinion is also taught in the Matsyapurana (221.2), which emphatically states: svam eva karma daivâkhyam viddhi dehântaràrjitam / tasmât paurusam eveha srestham ahur manîsinah II ("Understand [that, which] is called fate, [to be] one's own activity only, [as] acquired in another body. For this reason, the wise call human activity alone the best [means] in this world"). Cp. HDh 3: 170 for more quotations. Apart from them, I noted down the following Mahabharata passages deserving a closer investigation to determine their position within Kane's threefold scheme: I 10.27; 114.16; 192.12; II 43.32-34; m 92.10; 176.27; 240.14; V 40.30; 75.5-9; 77.4; 80.46; 187.17; VI 45.57; 58.1; 117.18; 24; VII 110.1; 127.22; 158.7; VIE 5.29; XII 56.15; 103.3; 17; 121.26; 137.46; 75-78; 152.32; 168.51; 171.12/ 224.50#, 230.4/ 335.82; XIV 53.6; XV 6.2.
