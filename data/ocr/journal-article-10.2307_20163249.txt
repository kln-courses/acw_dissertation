<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO VOICES OF HORACE David Armstrong Y THEN ARION FIRST SENT ROUND letters of inquiry and a questionnaire to see whether a Horace issue would be worth doing, we were not very hope ful; perhaps the many epitaphs on the Classical Influence delivered by our colleagues daunted us. The questionnaire proved too complex and detailed, and indeed we might have discarded it from the issue if W. K. Wimsatt's replies question by question had not been as attractive as they are; other responses were more general. But the volume of mate rial we received in reply was immense: the present issue, a double number, is larger by nearly a third than any issue we have ever printed. It seems obvious that, as much as any classical author, Quintus Horatius Flaccus remains some how present: as a few notes of Roman lyric, as an elegant and complex theorist of literature, as a personality imprinted on poems, to be attacked, defended, analyzed, translated, transformed, encountered. One slight disappointment remained when I organized the material for this issue, however; the influence and the interest seemed so largely to center round the Odes, with occasional references to the youthful Epodes and Sermones. Most convinced admirers of Horace, myself included, place the Epistles very high in the canon of his work; and since with the exception of the Ars Po?tica they are not much alluded to in the body of the issue, it seemed appropriate to redress the balance a little in this introduction. Conse quently I shall try to do three things: to give a brief account of Horace's life and work for the sort of general reader to whom this issue is largely aimed; then to discuss what I have called in my title the "two voices'' that puzzle readers of Horace, so that, for example, one runs across such allusions to Horace as H?lderlin s exquisite "der stille R?mer" and Robert Lowell's disparaging "Horatian suburbs." Which is right? either? neither? both? The debate goes on with all its usual liveliness, even in the pages of this issue. Finally, I give</page><page sequence="2">92 TWO VOICES OF HORACE a brief analysis of three Epistles, followed by Mr. Raffel's new versions of them, to illustrate the sort of voice Horace achieved in some of his latest, most finished, and most characteristic work. Horace was born December 8, 65 b.c., the son of a freed slave auctioneer in the little town of Venusia, north of Rome in the Sabine hills. It was an unpromising social back ground in a chaotic period of history. At Rome Cicero and Catiline were already spoiling for the fight that ended a year later in one more (because of Cicero's oratory, the most famous ) of the wars of Roman and Italian against Roman and Italian that had marked the last four or five decades of the Republic's history. The structure of Rome, a city govern ment governing Italy and the world, satisfied no one but the aristocratic and business families of the City, and not even all of them. The series of ambitious generals and popular politicians who raised the soldiers and people against the increasingly helpless senatorial government were themselves mostly aristocrats out to increase their own and their fam ilies' power at the expense of their order s. Catiline lost; a few years later, when Horace was five, Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, the First Triumvirate, took the government vir tually into their own hands and began a decade of compe tition for power that led to the longest and bloodiest of all the civil wars yet. As the power and privileges of the old Republican aristo cracy declined, their tight grip on class structure in Roman and Italian society?to the senatorial diehards Cicero him self seemed a little hairy around the heel?was weakening. Horace, who as a freedman's son held restricted citizenship (his father was not a citizen at all) found himself from a child confronted with problems of social status in a changing society, as well as the civil insecurity that touched every Italian life in this period. Middle-class families like his could find this unrest useful. Freed slaves who had made money were commonly eager to push themselves and their children forward in society; Horace's early poems show that he knew and disliked many such people. His own father took a subtler way of bringing a bright son forward: he took</page><page sequence="3">David Armstrong 93 the little Horace out of school at Venusia, where the poet says he was pushed around by ' magni pueri magnis e cen turionibus orti"?beefy sergeants' beefy sons?and sent him to the most expensive schools in Rome, giving his son the school-clothes, school-slaves, and liberal-literary training of a senator's child. Horace says he was grateful to his father for assuring him it didn't matter what he made out of this education, as long as he became a responsible and decent man. But it is obvious what the elder Horace hoped for. He lived to see only the beginning of a success beyond anything he could have imagined. While the old Republic was being torn apart, while Julius Caesar first crossed the Rubicon in arms against it, then defeated, year after year, its armies in Thessaly, Africa, Spain, Horace was going through the education of a Republican aristocrat step by step. The results encouraged his father (who died not long after) to send Horace to Athens, where at what was all but formally a University of the various schools of contemporary philosophy lecturers and tutors added logic, ethics and speculative science to the literary and practical training of the Roman governing class. About the time Horace went there Caesar was re turning in triumph to Rome as Dictator, with his grand nephew and heir Octavius at his side. Horace had not been in Athens long when in March 44 b.c. the Dictator Caesar was killed by Brutus and Cassius. The next year Brutus the Lib erator, fleeing from Italy before Mark Antony and the new Caesar Octavian, arrived in Athens to the wild enthusiasm of the young nobility. Horace had evidently come to share their prejudices. Not only did he join Brutus' army but he made a surprising personal impression on the Liberator himself, who created Horace tribunus militum. From this commission and the rank of Roman knight which usually came with it Horace should have been legally disqualified, and he was criticized for taking it. But he served for a year and shared Brutus' defeat at Philippi. In one of his poems (C. 2.7) he indulges in a moment of sad humor about the rout; but a year's colonelship in the Roman army was not something a man took on offhand, even without the added burden of being watched every moment as a nouveau.</page><page sequence="4">94 TWO VOICES OF HORACE Horace, however briefly, carried it off, and felt a certain pride in having done so for decades afterwards. After Philippi, however, this venture into military life was a dangerous embarrassment. Horace returned to Italy to find his property mostly confiscated, and used the remains of it to buy a clerkship of the state Treasury, more normal work for people of his background. As things turned out he did not have to keep it long. The new master of Italy, Caesar Octavian, was still very young, and depended for advice on some trusted friends who had been with him since Julius Caesar's death. One of these, C. Maecenas, was a man of fatefully different man ners and tastes from the rest. A fantastic who astonished Roman society with the bigarrure of his costume and his Latinity, he came from an Etruscan family ancient and noble enough to affect contempt for Roman honors, and took no Roman rank but that of a knight, to which his wealth entitled him many times over. His eccentricities were re membered for generations: his experiments with banquet dishes like a donkey's flesh, his attempt late in life to cure his chronic insomnia with a miniature waterfall in his bedroom. His creative impulses were not satisfied with his magnificent palace and gardens on the Esquilme; he had aspirations as a writer of contorted Asianic prose, to which Horace pays one guarded compliment (C. 2.12.19ff.), and of verse about which contemporary poets are silent. A morbid fragment is quoted with contempt by Seneca ("would you think Virgil had ever read to him . . "): Lame my hands, cripple my feet; load a hump on my back; as long as I uve, it's fine; I don't care if Im nailed to a cross: keep me alive! "Make me no tomb, Nature buries the corpses" is another line Seneca quotes, this time with approval. In many ways this unorthodox personality was as useful to the future Augustus (after the establishment of the Em pire he faded gradually into private life without losing the Emperor's friendship) as his more conventional rivals. He was extremely efficient as a diplomat and statesman, and</page><page sequence="5">David Armstrong 95 moreover one of history's first great masters of public rela tions. What was wanted was an air of return to the Roman and Italian past, a promise of peace and consolidation, especially as Octavian's rivals Antony and Cleopatra had appropriated the romance and glory of the kingly East. Here Maecenas' taste for the society of poets, which was not shared in Alexandria, came pat to the point. One of the first beneficiaries was Virgil, whose farm was restored after expropriation, and who thanked the young Caesar in elo quent pastoral verse (41 b.c. ). Not long after Horace bought his clerkship, Virgil introduced him, nervous and stammer ing, to Maecenas (38 b.c.). Their friendship started slowly, but grew into something far more personal than the mere relationship of patron and poet. Five years later Maecenas saw to Horace's needs for the rest of his life with the gift of the famous Sabine farm. About Roman social life, the rank of eques and scriba, and other such problems which torture some of his early poetry Horace never had to worry again. Virgil and Horace have frequently been criticised? especially by historians who dislike Augustus?as conserva tive, statist poets for accepting these livings, and to a certain extent they deserve it, and the invidious comparison that follows with such free spirits of the late Republic as Lu cretius and Catullus, and with younger poets of Augustus' reign?Propertius, Ovid?who devoted themselves to per sonal expression useless to, even at odds with, the moral tone of the new Empire. But the more extreme of such criti cisms?a good example is the account of them in Syme's epoch-making attack on Augustanism The Roman Revolu tion?serve only to throw into relief the essential honesty of the two poets in their difficult prominence, and the tact with which Augustus and Maecenas designed the relation ship. Both poets asserted themselves by refusing further gifts from the regime, Virgil a confiscated estate, Horace the surprising offer of a private secretaryship to the Princeps himself. Both felt free to avoid Rome for the independence and peace of the countryside to an extent which made them in their later years rather remote figures in the literary world</page><page sequence="6">96 TWO VOICES OF HORACE of the capital. Both exercised considerable freedom in their poetic development. The strange melancholy of Virgil's national epic the Aeneid proceeds from an assessment of Rome and its meaning in history by a mind whose values are essentially Italian, peaceful, and pastoral; but there is no evidence that Augustus wanted more ringing assent or more courtly flattery than the poem gives in two or three sonorous passages. As for Horace, the evolution of his literary work went on at his own speed. To a surprising extent; most of his early poems, till the three books of Odes (published 23 b.c. ), and indeed the largest part of the Odes are personal poems with no obvious connection to anything of use to the govern ment. The first and ninth of a book of seventeen Epodes, published in 29 b.c., are an anticipation and a congratula tion on Octavian's victory over Antony and Cleopatra at Actium. The other two "public" poems in the book, 7 and 16, are much earlier, despairing cries over the folly of per petual civil war, without reference to Octavian or any note of hope for the future. They give a clue at most to the ex periences of terror and disorder that lay behind Horace's reconciliation with the Empire. Others?particularly 8 and 12, spoken in the tone of a coarse and foul-mouthed young gigolo to an old patroness, and 15, a farewell to an ill-starred love-affair?give indispensable insights into a younger, wild er and more vulnerable personality behind the marmoreal tranquillity and good-natured disengagement that stamps much of Horace's later work. Horace's largest effort of the years 38-30 b.c., two books of Sermones ("Conversations"), is similarly devoted to self analysis and ethical speculation of an apolitical cast. Here he was resuming a tradition originated by the Republican poet Lucilius (c.180-102 b.c.) of informal poetry in hex ameter verse, one of the few purely Roman genres of litera ture. As he disliked the rambling formlessness the genre had encouraged in its inventor, Horace tightened both the verse structure and the argument. He imitated Lucilius' archaic roughness of sound, but worked line by line over the placement of each effect. The first book, published in 35 b.c.,</page><page sequence="7">David Armstrong 97 begins with three simple sounding diatribes on themes of popular philosophy: avarice, lust, friendship. These lent themselves perfectly to treatment in a manner Horace made peculiarly his own: a surface air, like Lucilius', of loosely joined conversation, passing easily from topic to topic, which reveals to closer inspection a tightly connected system of propositions interacting almost word by word. With these three pieces Horace sets up a fourth, combining criticism of Lucilius' thoughtlessness and prolixity with self-portrai ture. In others he describes a Journey to Brundisium with Maecenas, on some important political business Horace pointedly omits to mention; or an amusing account of his introduction to Maecenas, with some tangled thoughts about social climbing that open into startling simplicity and free dom: a tribute to his father "of whom I would be mad to be ashamed" and a description of himself lounging happily about Rome day-long, leaving to Novius (the nouveau) the heavy work of displaying his riches. At the end of the book is a reply to some critics who took the fourth poem as an attack on Lucilius, not noticing that Horace paid him enough of a compliment in imitating his style, form, content. In the little company of Virgil, Maecenas, etc., Horace can laugh at them. Five years later, perhaps, in 30 b.c. Horace published a second book, of which the chief interest is a similar but subtly altered literary and personal self-portrait. The key poem is the sixth, about his new life at the Sabine farm, for which he thanks Maecenas and the gods. He describes the bustle and boredom of Rome, for contrast with a dinner party at the farm where someone tells the old fable of the Town and Country Mouse, a symbolic summary of the whole poem. In two of the other poems Horace makes complicated fun of himself. In 3, a ruined businessman turned Stoic opens fire with an accusation that Horace's so-called intellectual leisure at the farm consists mainly of sleep and spoiled paper. He goes on to an interminable proof that all are mad ex cept the truly wise, and when Horace at last interrupts, be comes personal again with accusations of greed, lust, and ill-temper (as if Horace were making fun of his own wise</page><page sequence="8">98 TWO VOICES OF HORACE tone in S. 1.1-3). Satire 7 takes place at the Saturnalia, when slaves could say what they liked, and Horace's slave Dama gives him an embarrassing slave's-eye view of himself as moralist. The accusations of greasy servility to Maecenas, of woman-chasing "with your knight's ring and robe laid aside," of self-contradiction and silly discontent sting. The last line is the funniest: Horace, furious, shuts up the slave by threatening to pack him off to?the Sabine farm. When the second book of Satires and the Epodes were published Augustus' regime had just been securely estab lished. Horace now turned for a number of years to the pro duction of lyric poems in various Greek meters, most of them more complicated than Latin poets had attempted before, and only workable in Latin, less flexible in sound and far more limited in vocabulary, with the utmost effort at per fection word by word and line by line. Eighty-eight of these, perhaps fifteen on "public" themes and the rest meditative, convivial, amatory or in other more private genres, were published in three books in 23 b.c. Horace seems to have been disappointed in their reception; but no criticism sur vives (by comparison a fair number of the gibes that greet ed the Aeneid are preserved), and the Odes were so final an achievement that they might well have stunned comment. The effects of memorizing them show through the whole subsequent history of Latin poetry; but the metrical terri tory Horace conquered remained his own. Horace himself seems to have realized how strange a thing he had done; in this strenuous poetic venture, the adapta tion of the voice of the priests, athletes, statesmen who had written lyrics in an earlier, starker antiquity to Roman thoughts and Roman language, he transformed his own mind. He was borne into a different world of expression, feeling, symbol; his claims of inspiration and possession, which in some of his earliest lyrics may well be nothing more than Greco-Roman clich?, take on sincerity as his work progress es. In one poem he insists awkwardly and honestly on the paradox inherent in such claims for such a person as him self with an uncharacteristic, almost metaphysical disson ance:</page><page sequence="9">David Armstrong 99 non ego pauperum sanguis parentum, non ego quem vocas, dilecte Maecenas, obibo nee Stygia cohibebor unda. iamiam residunt cruribus asperae pelles, et album mutor in alitem superne, naseunturque leves per digitos umerosque plumae [C. 2.20.5 ff.] I, the son of poor parents, I, your guest, dear Mae cenas, am not a mortal, nor will the Styx drown me. Now, now the rough skin folds on my ankles; the white bird comes on me above, on my fingers and shoulders the delicate feathers spring_ In a more successful poem ( 2.13 ) written after he had nearly been killed by a f ailing tree on his estate, he joins his brush with death to thoughts of his Greek models Sappho and Alcaeus still singing in a fabulous poetic afterlife: quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae et iudicantem vidimus Aeacum sedesque discriptas piorum et Aeoliis fidibus querentem Sappho puellis de popularibus et te sonantem plenius aureo, Alcaee, plectro dura navis, dura f ugae mala, dura belli, utrumque sacro digna silentio mirantur umbrae dicere ... [C. 2.13.21 ff.] How near I came to the kingdom of gloomy Perse phone, and Aeacus judging the dead, and the good set off in their fields; and Sappho still complaining of the girls of her island on her lyre, and Alcaeus striking deeper songs with his golden quill: the pains of sea faring and exile and war. And at both their voices holy silence falls, and the ghosts wonder...</page><page sequence="10">lOO TWO VOICES OF HORACE The fantasy continues to the end of the poem; the mock curses of the tree and the reflections on the instability of life with which Horace began simply disappear into it, along with his own everyday persona. It seems no accident that the greatest criticism of these poems?for example, Pasquali's Orazio Lirico, or the famous passage in Fraenkel's Horace on the fourth Roman Ode in relation to Pindar's first Pythian?has always been directed precisely to Horace's encounter with his Greek models. The verbal and structural subdeties of the Odes, with their elaborate music and startling but always productive transi tions of thought, are an endless but finally rather airless field of study. The scholarly industry of collecting sources and parallels (for Horace, if he carried it lightly, was as learned a poet as he was careful) can lead by itself (as Nisbet and Hubbard's new commentary on Odes 1 abundantly shows ) to a discouraging impression that Horace himself was a mere collector of commonplaces. It is true that Horace rarely in vents a thought; in his theory of poetry it is by recombina tion, by verbal music, by unexpected juxtaposition that beauty appears where it was never seen before: "tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris," so much brilliance comes to the obvious (AP 242). But it was in the encounter with the great lyric poets of early Greece?he deprecated any com parison with them as equals?that he found the strength to make his commonplaces and Romanisms into something oc casionally almost visionary; and from a sense of this en counter between poets all really spacious and well-founded estimates of his lyric achievement must begin. Horace wrote little more in the lyric style; in 17 b.c. he accepted a commission for a Carmen Saeculare to be per formed at the magnificent games given by the Princeps for the preservation of Rome over the last century. It is a frigid piece of laureate work, but it left in its wake a far finer poem (C. 4.7) "on writing the Carmen Saeculare"; Horace evi dently did not compose well to order. At the emperor's re quest Horace combined some odes in praise of the imperial family with the last, and most perfect, of his personal lyrics into a brief fourth book of Odes and published them in</page><page sequence="11">David Armstrong i o i 13 b.c. But the greatest of his late work, and the bulk of it, is contained in a book of twenty short epistles and in three long ones?"To Augustus," "To Florus," and the "Art of Poetry"?in which he returned to the informal hexameters of the Sermones. With a difference; for the style of the Epistles offered none of the temptations to strained grandeur that occasionally spoil the Odes, and it is everywhere aired and lightened by Horace's experience of lyric composition. In the first book of Epistles (written 23-20 b.c. ), Horace de votes himself to a third self-portrait, this time of himself a decade older and secure, if not quite perfectly about his position in literary society, at least in a circle of friends, the addressees of the poems, to whom he can speak with confi dence and liberty. From the large variety of addressees in the Odes, which with some important exceptions like the Roman Odes are all supposed to be spoken to some particular person, it seems that to appear in the vocative case in one of Horace's poems was a sought-after compliment. This man nerism is developed still further in the Epistles, where the didactic tone is always qualified and personalized by a sense of the addressee's presence and particular needs. The longer Epistles all three, not merely the Ars Po?tica, develop Horace's theory of literature, and, particularly the Epistle to Florus, his idea on the relation of poetry and philosophy. The date of these poems is uncertain; but the tone of the Ars Po?tica and the Epistle to Florus is explicitly retrospective, and there seems no harm in viewing them as Horace's latest surviving compositions. About the last years of Horace's life, and of Maecenas', little is known, except that their friendship continued to the end. Maecenas was a demanding friend at the best of times (so Horace smilingly reminded him in one of the epistles of the first book) and one may guess that Horace was badly needed in his ugly dying years, when the artificial waterfall and soft music at nights failed to bring him sleep. After three years of nearly total insomnia Maecenas died in the autumn of 8 b.c. In his will he asked the Princeps "to remember Horatius Flaccus as you would me"; but the Princeps had no opportunity to follow the direction. Horace died only a few</page><page sequence="12">102 TWO VOICES OF HORACE weeks afterward, just before his fifty-eighth birthday, "so suddenly" says an ancient Life "that he had just time to name Augustus his heir by word of mouth." If Horace had any thing more than a conventional gesture of respect in mind, perhaps it is summed up in some words he had written long before to Maecenas: See if I cannot give it all happily back: "inspice, si possum donata reponere laetus" II From the fragments of Suetonius' Life it appears that Augustus, who cultivated a bluff, interesting literary style very much his own and knew a classic when he saw one, wrote Horace demanding firmly to be addressed in at least some of his poems as a friend: "or are you afraid," he added, "that posterity will make mouths at you if you appear to have been a familiar of mine?" The Epistle to Augustus which resulted rather sidesteps the question; but the long history of Horatian studies and their influence on European litera ture has indeed left a disturbing double vision of the same small body of work in its wake. Which is the real voice of Horace? Is it to be found in a poem like Marvell's Horatian Ode, intended as a serious response to what the poet saw as a similar period of civil war and reordering; or in a poem like Malherbe's ice-cold classical triumph ? M. du Perien Non, non, mon du Perier, aussit?t que la Parque ?te l'?me du corps, L'?ge s'?vanouit au de?? de la barque, Et ne suit point les morts. Tithon n'a plus les ans qui le firent cigale; Et Pluton aujourd'hui Sans ?gard du pass?, les m?rites ?gale D'Arch?more et de lui. Again, which is the true meaning of Horace's Ars Po?tica: is it reflected best in the heavy severities of Scaliger and Boi leau? or is it the complex, liberal, intelligent discussion Pro</page><page sequence="13">David Armstrong 103 fessor Brink's new commentary and Professor Wimsatt's essay in this issue seem to discover? Of the two little poems by Tommaso Stigliani and Fray Luis de Leon in our brief selection of "ancestors," which is most truly Horatian?Stigli ani's, with its pleasant, pompous self-satisfaction and its per fect symmetry, or Fray Luis's, with its austere sincerity and its one striking juxtaposition of thought? If one followed out Pound's suggestion of a history of English poetry through translations of Horace, the same two voices would appear: an early period of brilliance, in which the names of Marvell, Fanshawe, Cowley, Dryden, Congreve and Pope would figure with varying degrees of importance; then something far more discouraging: a period in which Horace's voice is the voice of the English upper classes, of dreadful, jingling amateur verse in which Horace and Lydia are turned into Pitt and Fox and, later on, Gladstone gives grave approval to Horace's notion of a Ship of State. I think, however, the most revealing example that could be given of the double vision of Horace occurs in one man, Matthew Arnold; revealing, because it seems a textbook example of how easily disapproval of Horace's hardwon disengagement and tranquillity can be betrayed by the subconscious appeal of his musical Latin voice. Arnold con cludes his inaugural lecture of 1850 as Professor of Poetry at Oxford with a sweeping criticism of Horace: ... Horace wants seriousness.... the men of taste, the men of cultivation, the men of the world are en chanted with him; he has not a prejudice, not an illusion, not a blunder. True! yet the best men in the best ages have never been thoroughly satisfied with Horace. If human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, Horace . . . would be the perfect interpreter of human life: but it is not. . .. Horace warms himself before the transient fire of human animation and human pleasure while he can, and is only serious when he reflects that the fire must soon go out:? "Damna tarnen c?leres reparant coelestia lunae: Nos, ubi decidimus?"</page><page sequence="14">104 TWO VOICES OF HORACE "For nature there is renovation, but for man there is none!"?it is exquisite, but it is not interpretive and fortifying. [Essays in Criticism, 3rd Series, Boston 11910,80ff.] It is a surprise, after this, to find one of Arnold's greatest poetic effects resulting from an intuition that subconsciously combines two apparently unconnected phrases of Horace: "deus, deus nam me vetat" (Epod. 14.6), "nequiquam deus abscidit / prudens Oc?ano dissociabili" (C. 1.3.21 f.) : A God, a God their severance ruled And bade betwixt their shores to be The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea. It used to be the fashion in Victorian schoolbooks to ex plain such anomalies with a murmur about "jewels three words long" (Browning), leaving the basic estimate of Horace unchanged; but neither phrase is among Horace's famous tags, and the fact is that Arnold has been led through them to a profound, if momentary intuition of something Greek; a feeling for divine reality beyond the vulgar anthro pomorphism of mythology, what Gilbert Murray called the instinctive language of the poets, using the word theos in many subtle senses for which our word "God" is too stiff, too personal, and too anthropomorphic. To eutuchein, "the fact of success," is a god and more than a god; to gign?skein philous, "to recognize a friend" after a long absence, is a "god"; wine is a "god" whose body is poured out in libation to gods; and in the unwritten law of the human conscience "a great god liveth and groweth not old"_ [Five Stages of Greek Religion, London 1935,12; Greek transliterated] I take it that these examples from Arnold are sufficient to characterize the difference between reading Horace and en countering him as one supposes him to have encountered Sappho and Pindar. He is to blame, certainly, for limiting so severely ("quid valeant umeri . . .") the variety and interest of his paraphrasable content; and the emphasis a critic lays</page><page sequence="15">David Armstrong 105 on the part Greece, Rome and his own character and aims played in the creation of those poems will always vary. But such characteristic combinations of Greek feeling for light, Roman subjectivity of perception, and contextual appropri ateness as Horace can frequently strike out: quodsi dolentem nee Phrygius lapis nee purpurarum sidere clarior delenitusus... [C. 3.1.41 ff.] What, if neither red marble nor the owning of purple brighter than stars soften a man's mourning . . . seem to demand an equal openness and creativity of response from a critic. Arion is sometimes criticized for its emphasis on translation; but this preeminently is a field where such encounters take place, even more than in the best discursive criticism; and such perceptions as are implied in various translations in this issue?for example, Christopher Mac gregor's transformation of the storm images in the Pyrrha Ode into a storm of paper, or Paul Oppenheimer's surrealiz ing of Horace's allusive names (Hamlet, Ophelia, Mozart) ?are very reassuring about the presence of life in the orig inals. But as we said at the beginning, there is also a different and equally Horatian "voice," the voice of his final confron tation with himself, his ideas, and his art in the Epistles: and it is with a brief analysis of some of the shorter of these that I should like to conclude this introduction. Ill Epist. 1.1. Horace's interest in education shows not infre quently in his informal poetry?he was after all the inventor of the tag about the "groves of Academe," "inter silvas Aca demi quaerere verum." How strictly the twenty separate epistles of the first book cohere is of course debatable, but the first and twentieth seem composed "for" the books as pro logue and epilogue. A reappearing theme in both, a sort of</page><page sequence="16">lo6 TWO VOICES OF HORACE id?e ma?tresse to be seen not only in 1 and 20 but in others, particularly 2, and explaining to a certain extent the context and tone of an epistle like 16, is education, whether carried on in school or in the private life of an adult person like Horace, and the nature and scope of its aim. At the begin ning Horace prepares this theme by complaining to Mae cenas that he is asked to write poetry again, to "shut himself up in the old gladiator-school"; but he has put such play things ("ludiera") aside. Here is a neat opportunity for a pun, which runs all through the rest of the epistle, variously handled: for "ludus" in Latin means both "school" and "game" and Horace is interested in which is which. At the moment he is involved (he claims) in relearning the ABC's of philosophy, and feels like a Stoic, Epicurean, Hedonist according to the weather ("quo me cumque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes," 15). Here occurs the famous line "nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri," literally, "not bound over to swear by the 'ipse dixit' of any teacher" (14). There is a context to it which makes it mean more, for Horace does not in fact mean that his charmingly eclectic state is real wisdom, though he has been taken to say so. In fact as the rest of the epistle makes abundantly clear he feels that this shifting inconsistency of mind is characteristic and appropriate rather to the vulgar, whose obvious values and confused greed lead only to instant dissatisfaction with whatever they happen to possess. We have only to note the terms in which later on he arraigns the usual effect of a Roman business education ( "none of you can decide for a moment what you really want in spite of all this seeming-practical stuff about rem, rem, rem you copied into your notebooks at school"). Indeed Horace concludes the epistle by asking Maecenas why he is ready to criticize his friend's ill-arranged dress and ill-kept hands, but lets his opinions pass unnoticed even if they con tradict each other absolutely (95-105). Horace presents himself as searching for a locus standi, and he is conscious of seeking it in an extraordinary way: by going back to the beginning, by taking at least the very first lessons of philosophy as if they had meaning. He apol ogizes a little for doing this: One doesn't throw away eye salve (he alludes here to a physical trouble of his own) be</page><page sequence="17">David Armstrong 107 cause one hasn't a chance of becoming really lynx-eyed, or give up exercise (about which Horace was lazy: both ex amples rely on one's knowing the Sermones) because one can't hope for the Olympics (28-31). Similarly, to proceed to the junior or senior level in philosophy is at least some thing, frees one a little from the disquiet of acting in per petual self-contradiction (32ff.). To return to childhood, to begin from the beginning lessons one never understood or took seriously, is better still. ". . . The skies were mine, and so were the sun and moon and stars, and all the World was mine; and I the only spec tator and enjoyer of it. I knew no churlish proprieties, nor bounds, nor divisions : but all proprieties and divisions were mine; all treasures and the possessors of them. So that with much ado I was corrupted and made to learn the dirty de vices of this world. Which now I unlearn, and become as it were a little child again, that I may enter into the kingdom of God." The Greeks and Romans were rather lacking in sentiment about the wisdom of childhood. "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings" is not a classical thought. It is sur prising, therefore, that Horace should light on a line of rea soning not unlike Traherne's. But if one understood by "the kingdom of God" that of the tense serenity of the Stoic "logos," or the different serenity of one of Epicurus' gods, not a word of Traherne's passage would be discordant with what Horace has to say in this epistle. Horace's concern with the everyday vs. the philosophical meaning of "property" is, in its different mode, equally intense. "Money first, virtue sec ond," he says (53ff.) is the lesson all Rome learns, because if you have a little bit less than the equestrian census ( and one thinks of his own early worries about equestrian status) "plebs eris," you will be one of the mob. But (not to mention the idealist philosophers, he means ) children, even children sing "rex eris," you will be king, at least of the game, if you do right (59ff.). Well, why not? The Roscian law, by which ?quit?s get front seats at the shows, was made by adults; is it more intelligent than "rex eris si recte faci?s," which is a children's song (62-4)? And if one tried to follow the so called adult values, either of the populus Romanus or the</page><page sequence="18">lo8 TWO VOICES OF HORACE nobility, where would one end? None of them can really decide what they want, but change ideas with the hour; and Horace feels in his own efforts to find a philosophy the after effects or hangover of having been educated in their incon sistent self-seeking. So he concludes by mildly criticizing Maecenas for not offering more challenging conversation in his efforts to reeducate himself, and with a charming joke which is also at the expense of his own late-learning: ad summam, sapiens uno minor est love, dives, liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum, praecipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est [106-108] At Horace's stage, he means, one can feel like the Stoic wise man, the only truly beautiful, happy, sane, free person, the only true king (of himself), etc., only if the weather (an allusion to tempestas back at the beginning, 1.15) has not given one a cold. It would be easy to underline the theme of adult educa tion, a return to the beginning to "unlearn the dirty divices" of the greedy Roman world, by pointing out the poem's covert and open allusions to education besides those already noted (e.g.: elementis, 27; culturae, 40; discere, etc., 48; the use of an Aesop's fable in 73ff., as if Horace had finally caught the point of something he learned as a very little child; tutela of Maecenas in 1.103, where cf. Kiessling Heinze's note). The second epistle of the book develops the theme even more explicitly. It is to a young friend who is practising his rhetoric (2) at Rome; Horace, who is older, has gone back to an earlier stage of the Roman curriculum than that, for he is rereading the Iliad and Odyssey and drawing the lessons from them he hardly knew how to find when he was a child. Paradoxically ( after all the modesty of the first epistle) the poem ends in Horace's taking a pleasant ly but firm didactic line (31-71) with the young Lollius: If Lollius, he implies, has not learned such lessons in ethics as those taught by the wrath of Achilles or the suitors of Pene lope, what is the use of going on to "advanced" rhetoric? Few of the epistles that follow lack some didactic lesson, stated or implied, taught from the quiet of the Sabine farm.</page><page sequence="19">David Armstrong 109 The tone and subject of the first two epistles are meant ex plicitly to establish that Horace is aware of the common place surface air of this teaching. It is a return to simplicity and to the simplest of values as a beginning for his criticism of the complexity and futility of a great deal of political and urban life. There are some very striking examples, e.g. 6, in which he holds up a number of irreconcilable philosophical ideals to one Numicius without forcing a decision on him?a development of the thought of 1.14ff.?but seems rather to favor the severest of them; or 7, in which he hints pretty forcibly to Maecenas that he has developed an independence of mind to which in the last resort even the Sabine farm is no longer necessary. (Of course he intended a compliment to his friend, rather than the reverse, in publishing so free spoken a poem). One of the most ambitious and self-assured of these didactic epistles is 1.16. This poem is addressed to Quinctius, a young Roman rich enough to be courted and flattered, and with pretensions to philosophy. The structure of this epistle looks difficult at first. It opens with a description of the Sabine farm ( 1-16), but goes on into inform Quinctius that Horace hopes he does not allow his clients to flatter him he is the Stoic Wise Man on the grounds that he is a nice person and has read some books. Would he let them address him in terms dan gerous for anyone but the Emperior to allow? and is a Wise Man a greater or less thing than an Emperor? A surprising transition, but the difficulty is only apparent, for Horace's aim in describing the simple countryside where he lives is to give first the ground of his being, the place from which he can speak so authoritatively as this to the busy young Roman. The first words are "tu recte vivis, si"?"you are living well, if"?and this necessarily implies that the description of the Sabine farm meant "sic recte vivo." Horace continues: If you allow people to call you Wise Man, if you are pleased by that, then it depends on their voice, not on reality, whether you are or not. But in fact all they can judge by is externals; and all one really deserves for being externally a decent person is to be let alone, an estimate which Horace says even his Sabine neighbors would make (here, 49, he touches a moment the scene of the opening lines). The way in which the Sabine</page><page sequence="20">110 TWO VOICES OF HORACE farmers would answer a slave who claimed merit for not do ing anything punishable brings Horace round to the Stoic paradoxes again: only the wise are free, all fools are slaves. Horace says nothing quite so extreme, but he implies ( 69-72 ) that people who do not understand themselves are commer cially useful, not otherwise. By contrast a truly wise man ( here Horace is being quite serious?there is no mock ending to this poem, as there was to 1 ) is as laughing and as free before the worst that can happen as Dionysus was in front of Pentheus in the Bacchae. Quinctius (it was earlier assumed) would be terrified if someone paid him a compliment in terms applicable only to Augustus (27ff.). But a wise man can stand before a dictator and not even feel threatened. "Adi man bona," says Horace's Pentheus, "I will take away your goods." The pun is crucial to the poem: "goods" are one thing to the philosopher and another to the materiahst. And ?even more startlingly?death, which the tyrant does not understand and the wise man does, and the impermanence of human life, are what make the philosopher understand ideal as opposed to transient "good." "Oh?flocks, property, couches, silverware. Take them." Pentheus threatens the Dionysus-Wise Man with prison. "The God will free me when I choose." As Horace (probably following the Stoics) allegorized this Euripidean scene, it meant that the Wise Man may die when he chooses. Next he gives the reason the Wise Man is so indifferent: "mors ultima linea rerum," death is the ulti mate goal of things; not only an expression of tranquillity and indifference before death, but a second exquisite pun, like that on bona about values based on greed, for res are the quintessential worry of the unwise. A complicated line of thought leads from the picture of the Sabine farm to the paraphrase of the Bacchae, but one worth following, and it shows Horace startlingly in command of his own delicate, gentle manner of teaching. 1.20. As the three books of Odes had opened with a prologue to Maecenas and then an epilogue celebrating the book it self (3.29 and 30), so this book closes with an address to Maecenas (19) and then an epilogue humorously dismissing</page><page sequence="21">David Armstrong i11 the book, half-personified as a handsome slave eager to sell himself, into the world. In the epistle to Maecenas ("thor oughly bitter" Fraenkel called it) Horace reiterates his claim to originality as a poet, and dismisses angrily both his critics and his imitators; Roman literary society of this sort is a ludus (19.477ff.) to which he is not eager to belong. The contemptuous tone of this poem only makes the brightness and freedom of the epilogue more striking, however. Horace develops in this epilogue, very unobtrusively, the thought of his own immortality: it is another "exegi monumentum," but in the mode of informal hexameter verse,* and all the more impressive for its mock-diffidence. The book's longing to be prostituted to its public, and Horace's misgivings in sending it out, are depicted in a series of graphic puns; and its ulti mate fate when it no longer possesses any sex appeal?to be shipped out, like an old slave, to the provinces or made into a teacher in a cheap school?continue the metaphor. But ( though in a cheap school any book that came to hand could be used for instruction) the context makes it clear what Horace is unobtrusively doing: saying a.) that the book will eventually be sold all over the Roman world, and b. ) will be (as in fact it quickly became) a school classic. About being a school classic, as about his own clich?s of "philosophical" thought in the opening poem, Horace is capable of humor and detachment. But he takes the transition to this unob trusive but exalted claim as an opportunity for an even more startling gesture: the inclusion of a list of various things about himself that the book may tell people, if it likes, for all time, in which the trivial and the important are mingled with remarkable self-assurance. The poet, who started the book by returning to the lessons of the school, has himself composed a school-book; and in the flush of this achievement he can instruct the book not only to mention his favor with Augustus and Maecenas and his service with Brutus ("me primis urbis belli placuisse domique"), but his shortness, his * Compare with the delicate allusion both to Horace's social and poetic flights in "maiores pennas nido extendisse loqueris" (21) the uncomfortable explictness of the same allusion in C. 2.20, already quoted.</page><page sequence="22">112 TWO VOICES OF HORACE gray hair, his temper, and the consuls of the year when he was forty-four. Horace will never be quite free of a reputa tion for unambitious, tranquil, moralizing suitable for the schools but not for adults. It is a little unnerving, and per haps the best answer one can give to the question why for all that his mind and art will never be finally set aside in favor of the "real people," Greeks or otherwise, to find on closer inspection how thoroughly he saw in advance, turned around and round in his mind, and laughed out of court precisely this notion of himself.</page><page sequence="23">David Armstrong 113 Horatian Studies and Translations in earlier issues of Arion [note: Arion pagination is discontinuous by quarter for the first three years, but consecutive thereafter.] Arion, vol. 1 (1962), 4.84, Copley, Frank O., "Yet Once More" (review of Steele Com mager's The Odes of Horace) 2 ( 1963), 1.56, Kilmer, Nicholas, tr. of Epode 12 3.57, Crosset, John, 2 trs. of C. 1.5 3.59, Quinn, Kenneth, "Horace as Love Poet: a rdg. of Odes 1.5" 4.63, Murray, Philip, tr. of S. 2.8 3 ( 1964), 1.22, Wills, Gary, tr. of C. 1.10 1.23, Kilmer, Nicholas, tr. of C. 1.11 and 1.13 1.116, Armstrong, David, "Second Thoughts on Fraenkel's Horace" 2.86, Armstrong, David, "Horace, Satires 1.1-3: a Structural Study" 4.117, Lee, M.
