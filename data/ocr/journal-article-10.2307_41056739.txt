<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ritual, Ethnicity, and Transculturalism in Penang Mohd. Razha Rashid Wazir-jahan Karim Malay propitiation rituals which are essentially animistic in ideology and form have been increasingly subject to severe criticism by Islamic specialists. As they get discarded by the Malays, the Chinese "adopt" them as an integral component of economic and religious activity. In a particular sea propitiation ritual, the puja pantai, Malays have become "ritual brokers" performing the ceremony for financial gain. These symbolic deconstructions and reconstructions of religion across ethnic boundaries express processes of trans- culturalism and ritual mediation. In the long term, these processes suggest afusi√≥n of ethnic boundaries within a similar occupational strata although wider socio-political forces work to the contrary. Introduction Studies on rituals in Malaysia have placed much emphasis on the ethnological and ethnographic aspects of ritual behaviour within par- ticular ethnic groups. A number of these studies have focused on Malay rituals in the context of economic activity and class (Firth 1946), socialization processes (Wilder 1970), and Malay religious practices (Skeat 1967; Endicott 1970; Nagata 1984). Similarly, certain anthro- pologists who have focused on aboriginal communities in Malaysia (Dentan 1965; Endicott 1979; Carey 1976; Karim 1981) have relied mainly on information obtained from specific aboriginal groups despite the fact that the kind of analysis employed may have been enriched if research had gone beyond the ethnographic boundaries of a particular culture. However, in the context of cultural assimilation, urbanization, and</page><page sequence="2">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 63 modernizing influences, ritual thought and behaviour can no longer be considered purely in ethnological and ethnographic terms or constrained within a certain ethnic arena. Changes in the functional and symbolic aspects of belief and behaviour necessitate research with a different theoretical perspective, possibly one using a transcultural framework whereby underlying structural changes in the form and content of ritual may be discussed and analysed more meaningfully. This study is con- cerned with the phenomenon of cultural fusion, of how different ethnic communities experience a convergence of ritual activity while maintain- ing other distinctions in ethnicity. Ethnicity is here defined as the sharing of common characteristics, of history, language, and culture by a population which recognizes these characteristics to be an important source of identity and group membership. In this sense, the term ethnicity signifies a particular form of social grouping in which membership is inherited by birth or acquired through marriage or other forms of social officiation. The implication made here is that processes of transculturalism, as manifested in ritual action, do not necessarily lead to a diffusion of ethnicity. The field of ritual action may be compared to FurnivalFs (1968) market-place in pluralistic societies - different ethnic groups get together to perform tasks for their mutual benefit (in this case the "buy- ing" and "selling" of ritual) and go about their separate lives without really feeling any closer to each other than before. Yet, ritual action fuses into thought and ideology introducing components of transculturalism in society. This phenomenon is described in Malay-Chinese ritual behaviour concerning the worship of sea spirits in Penang. The term "ritual" has been defined and redefined by anthropologists time and again, sometimes specifically to refer to technical acts associated with a particular ideological or belief system, or more generally to modes of behaviour pertaining to various social, economic, and political institutions in a society that are consistent and predictable over the long term. In this study, the concept of ritual will be taken to mean behavioural expressions of ideology and belief which are socially acceptable or maintained by members of society, and more specifically acts which comprise consistent modes of behaviour performed in the context of socio-economic or political institutions.</page><page sequence="3">64 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 Changing Patterns in Traditional Malay Fishing Rituals and Transculturalism Traditional patterns of ritual sacrifices performed by Malay fishermen in Penang occur in an increasingly Chinese environment. Malay fishermen with their dependency on weather conditions and fear of natural calamities during fishing activities have traditionally preserved their reservoir of animistic rituals designed to reduce misfortune and uncertainties arising from fishing activities. Here, Chinese fishermen share a common interest in Malay animism and follow the ritual ac- tivities of their Malay counterparts very closely. It has been noted that the religious tradition of the Malays, notably the peasantry, is a com- posite of Indie, Islamic, and animistic elements. The two great religions of Hinduism and Islam have permeated the peasant mass and have become fused with the underlying animistic tradition characteristic of Malay and other Southeast Asian cultures. Thus, the result is a syn- cretism of myth and rituals in which Hindu gods and goddesses, Muslim prophets and saints, and localized spirits and demons are all integral to the religious system. In Malaysia, however, Islam has always been the official point of reference of Malay religion, although the composite elements of beliefs and rituals are strongly embedded in Hindu animistic traditions. The Chinese have, through Taoism and ancestor worship, incorporated many animistic traditions along the way but in the case of the fishing community, seem to place priority in emulating Malay traditional styles of worshipping and propitiating sea spirits. Significantly, when some of these Indic-animistic rituals are discarded by the Malays, Chinese fishermen "adopt" them as an integral com- ponent of economic and social activity. In the sphere of fishing-related activities, the devaluation of animistic rituals amongst Malay fishermen and adoption of them by the Chinese have accorded them a new im- portance in the local fishing community. These rituals have acquired a market or commercial value. In keeping with Chinese methods of creating symbolic associations between ritual authenticity and economic activity, the rituals have been elaborated and extended, with Malay ritual specialists being mainly responsible for the forms and methods of ritual innovation, and the Chinese being responsible for covering the costs. This process in turn creates a new social category of Malay "ritual</page><page sequence="4">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 65 entrepreneurs" who see the performance of these rituals as an impor- tant commercial activity and, in some instances, even more important than fishing. The Chinese in turn, see such ritual exercises as impor- tant religious events, enhanced by their own religious ideologies and their perception of Malay animism as being original and the best. Con- sequently, Malay-Chinese relations within the fishing community are bounded by a complex set of inter-cultural borrowings that are in- timately bound by considerations of mutual need in ritualization and commercialization. Eventually, these ritual processes reveal an exchange of priorities and preferences, with the Malays becoming more commer- cialized about ritual and the Chinese being more ritualized about fishing. More generally, these mutual value exchanges reflect a convergence of ideologies at some point, but they do not necessarily produce the same effects on ethnicity. Ethnic consciousness or the need to retain ethnic identities could in fact even be reinforced in the public and formal domain as each community develops its own set of socio-economic preferences and values. Within this highly volatile domain of socio- economic relations, it is important to see the extent to which trends of ritualization in fishing provide solutions and answers to the problems of ideology, ethnicity, and integration. It is against this background of social issues that this study of ritual propitiation of sea spirits may be located. Among the Malay fishermen of Kelantan and Trengganu, there used to be a communal coastal ritual of propitiation performed to ward off misfortune from the sea. According to narrations by an author on Malay customs, the ritual called puja pantai was performed once in every four or seven years in which fishermen offered buffalo sacrifices so that no ill luck would befall them during fishing trips. Furthermore, it was also supposed to ensure that their catch might be abundant for the whole year (Yasin 1982, p. 68). However, this ritual was banned in both Kelantan and Trengganu by the respective state religious (Islamic) departments in the mid-1960s because the ritual contradicts the teaching of the official religion of Islam. Puja pantai, as a Malay communal ritual, is a well-known propitia- tion ritual. It even used to enjoy the support and participation of royalty and state dignitaries. The same kind of ritual is performed throughout the coastal area in West Malaysia, but it is less well known not only</page><page sequence="5">66 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 because it is less elaborate in structure but also because it is more localized, with participation being restricted to only members of the village community. In the fishing settlements of Kedah and Perlis, similar ritual sacrifices called sembah pantai (literally, "to pray to the beach") were performed by the coast. Albino buffaloes were sacrificed to sea spirits (hantu air) that preyed in certain turbulent areas of the sea. Skeat (1967, p. 280) has also reported a propitiation ritual similar in content to these rituals, in Ayer Hitam, Johor, called sembah blat. Thus, although the term for the ritual varies from area to area, the basic form and content of these rituals are the same, where the prin- cipal theme is to "appease" specific sea spirits, to protect the fishermen of a particular area against natural calamities, as well as to guarantee them a continuous or abundant catch (Endicott 1970, p. 24). Un- doubtedly, the performance of this ritual and its dominant theme clearly reflect the animistic element of Malay traditional religious practices as opposed to their professed religious doctrine, Islam. Malay rituals with elements of animism are not new. The available literature on Malay magic or Malay world-view (see Endicott 1970; Skeat 1900) and Malay customary practices (Yasin 1962; Syed Alwi 1960) indicates strong at- tachments of Malay beliefs to supernatural forces that coexist alongside the human domain.1 The "coexistence" ranges from the symbiotic to the competitive, contains anthropomorphic notions, and ideas of human dominance or submission to nature spirits. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the structure of Malay animism in the Malay world- view, but it is important to note that these beliefs are very much alive, often enhanced by socio-economic activity which may be regarded as "risk-bearing". It is important to note here that the embeddedness of the animistic elements in Malay traditional rituals contradicts the professed faith of the performers, that is, Islam. While being Muslim demands strict adherence to the faith in the unity of God, these traditional rituals on the other hand have their basis in the belief in identifiable "spirits" which may be negotiated with. There is an apparent structural contradic- tion. However in the past, these contradictions were not recognized or it would seem that little weight was attached to them. Ultimately the two sets of beliefs were fused in a single world-view, maintained by a common symbolic system.</page><page sequence="6">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 67 It must be noted that this neat fusion of a "synchromeshed" religion had always been traditionally accepted by the Malays and these rituals with animistic elements were never challenged. Often, the ritual specialists, that is, the pawang and bomoh were also religious (Islamic) leaders or imams. However, in the last decade, the two contradictory sets of beliefs in the Malay world-view have undergone a process of fission and, as mentioned earlier, this has produced formal and public censorship of Malay Indic-animistic rituals and ceremonies of which the puja pan tai was one.2 What is apparent here is the tendency towards formalizing Islam through a reformulation of socio-ritual ac- tivities according to the doctrinal teachings of the Koran and Hadith. The phenomenon of the formalization of Islam within the political- bureaucratic machinery is too complicated to discuss here. Nevertheless, it may be noted that research shows, for example, that Malay Islamic fundamentalism may be seen in terms of a conscious, mass attempt to regain political power, lost through public political censorship of many forms (Kessler 1980) or a resurgence of ethnic consciousness in conflict situations (Nagata 1984). In any case, what is obvious in the present situation is the tendency towards a "desyncretization" of the elements of Islam from animistic beliefs. Or, to use the classical anthropological distinction introduced by Redfield (1960), one might say that animistic beliefs belong to the sphere of the "Little Tradition" while a new "Great Tradition" has evolved in the form of fundamental Islam. It is in the context of the above contradictions that we wish to pre- sent this description and analysis of ritual process and transculturalism. Since ritual is the active presentation of beliefs, it is reasonable to say that contradictions in beliefs will be reflected in the contradictions in ritual performances. Such contradictions in beliefs are best presented within the framework of the social dynamics that precede ritual, that is, the various incidents, discussions, conflicts, as well as compromises between groups which constitute the larger context of the ritual event. The ritual in question is similar to the ritual of puja pantai though the degree of elaboration is much less. It was performed annually in the fishing village of Telok Kumbar in Penang, as an annual sacrifice to a spirit on an island off Penang. The ritual is referred to by the local fishermen as kenduri doa selamat Pulau Kendi, literally, "a feast of prayer for good fortune at Pulau Kendi".</page><page sequence="7">68 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 The "Ritual Process" in Telok Kumbar: Malay Deconstructions and Chinese Reconstructions Telok Kumbar is a coastal settlement on the southern coast of Penang island. It is situated about 14 miles (approximately 22.5 km.) from Georgetown, and is a rather large settlement comprising five villages, the oldest being Kampung Nelayan (literally, "Fishermen's Village"). Telok Kumbar as a whole comprises about 230 homes with a total population of 2,674 of which 2,225 are Malays and approximately 300 are full-time fishermen and 120 are part-time fishermen. Part-timers are those who have other sources of income, namely wage-labour and seasonal agriculture consisting of, for example, fruit cultivation. The entire area of Telok Kumbar was too big to be managed as a single field so that participant observation and data gathering was, even- tually, concentrated on Kampung Nelayan. The working population of this kampung, as the name suggests, consisted entirely of fishermen and the kampung is the oldest settlement in Telok Kumbar. When research was undertaken in 1981, there were fifty-eight houses with a population of 322. The population of this kampung is exclusively Malay and out of the total population only seventy-eight were of the age group of forty and above and four of seventy and above. In demographic terms, the kampung has a largely youthful population. The non-fishing com- munity includes the ketua kampung (the headman), teachers, a clerk, five factory workers, a prawn-paste maker, a shopkeeper, and govern- ment clerks. Towards the end of the field-work, in January 1983, the socio-demographic composition of the village had not changed significantly. In the period of the late 1960s, Telok Kumbar was a bustling fishing port with Kampung Nelayan enjoying the reputation of bringing home the largest catch from fishing and fishing-related activities. Traditionally, the area was known for a kind of fishing method known as rawai but gradually, in the late 1970s, with the encroachment of trawlers from other fishing ports in Penang and elsewhere, the rawai method of fishing was completely abandoned. Presently, the fishing method is pre- dominantly of the hook-and-line type, where fishermen specialize in catching high-quality varieties of fish such as senangin or kerapu. In any case, the emphasis on fishing activities had definitely declined, as</page><page sequence="8">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 69 was evident from the abandonment of the highly specialized and lucrative rawai technique. Significantly, there had been no purchase of new boats in this village for the past three years. The last boat was bought six years ago. Two boats were abandoned (although still operable) because their owners were unable to find crews to man them. Older, larger boats for deep-sea fishing were not favoured because of capital constraints, the cost of upkeep, and threats of piracy in open water. Most of these boats have since been sold off to the Chinese who use them as trawlers. At the time of this research, there were two boats for sale because of the high costs of operations and low profits from fishing.3 Increasingly, alternative forms of employment were sought in the nearby industrial area of Bayan Lepas, about 4 miles (approximately 6.8 km.) away from the town of Telok Kumbar. Nevertheless, the older generation of fishermen represents an iden- tifiable category by virtue of their association with activities relating to the sea. As a category, these fishermen or "those who work in the sea" can be broken down into several subcategories based on owner- ship of gear and priorities relating to fishing. There are the full-timers in fishing and the part-timers; full-timers fish regularly using personally owned or rented boats, while the part-timers intersperse their fishing activities with odd jobs on land. However, the stratification within the category is somewhat complicated. The boat owner-operator normally enjoys a higher status than those who rent their boats. Whatever the apparent economic differentials, the significant point is that as opposed to other occupational groups, the fishermen have a certain degree of "group consciousness". In other words, they are more "communal" in their feelings towards one another and are more inclined to socialize among themselves especially on beaches in the day and night and in coffee shops in between fishing activities. The cohesiveness of the fishing community follows the nature of the work - which demands a certain degree of co-operation. For instance, fishermen will not go out to sea alone, but they will always operate in flotillas of boats. This is to ensure that they can help one another in case of bad weather, or share bait or hooks when necessary. It is also the norm among them to pro- vide information on areas where good catches are landed so that others can share their luck there. More importantly, faced with the same feel- ings of uncertainty and precariousness, they tend to share their fortunes</page><page sequence="9">70 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 with one another communally and whenever possible, because of the risks inherent in their common source of livelihood. It is against this background of anxiety and sense of "corporateness" that the beliefs in supernatural spirits of the sea prevail. The conversa- tions of fishermen constantly revolve around the topic of safety or death. Most declare that they will not give up fishing, though each time they go out to sea they are not sure if they will return alive. The puja pantai ritual has always been an integral part of their socialization for generations. Consequently, a common pervasive ideology has been that the one way to reduce the precariousness and the uncertainties of fishing is to "co-operate" with "the one who waits or resides" or the penunggu of the sea. This consistently reproduces the traditional anthropomor- phism in the Malay world-view. In everything and everywhere there is "the one who waits or resides" and the penunggu, like humans, has needs, desires, appetites, emotions as well as power. Thus, like humans, it too respects the desires, appetites, emotions as well as power of humans, if it is well treated. The relationship is sympathetic rather than antagonistic, symbiotic rather than hierarchical. Every year, it is renewed in the ritual of kenduri doa selamat, where a ritual "contract" is re- established. The co-operation is maintained for yet another year, till the next ritual agreement is made. To convey the essence of this ritual, we present here an account by S. Maarof, who spent some time at the village while undertaking research relating to fishing economics: Today, 17th. March, 1971 I learned about the spirit belief of the fishermen of Telok Kumbar. This may not be directly relevant to economics, but I think it is important because the belief influences the activities of the fishermen. According to local accounts, the sea that stretches from here to Pulau Langkawi to the North is guarded by a spirit named Tak Hitam'. This evening I learned that there is going to be a ritual in Pulau Kendi where Tak Hitam' resides. According to local accounts, the general lay-out is mainly rocky with caves. The island is uninhabited for the simple reason that it has no source of fresh water. Legends and beliefs have it that in one of the caves dwells the great 'Pak Hitam' - guardian of the Island and the stretch of seas as high up as Langkawi. Once a year a feast or kenduri must be held in his honour for the good and well being of all fishermen. Failure to feast will result in calamities such as death at sea, bad stormy weather and poor catch.</page><page sequence="10">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 71 It was alleged that fishermen in the past (in the event of failure to feast) had for no reason fallen into the sea and were drowned. Even expert swimmers would appear then to be helpless and over- come by some unforeseen powers. 'Pak Hitam' would show his anger by low growling sounds from the island - heard years ago. Some even attribute poor catch to symptoms of Tak HitamY discontent. The occasion is not fixed by any specific calendar calculation but it has to be done at least once a year. When the time comes, 'Pak Hitam' would approach the local pawang (usually in a dream) and ask for the due feast. The pawang is the person who decides when to have the feast. This year, the pawang who was approached by 'Pak Hitam' is Pak Hassan Tok Amin - himself a fisherman. The normal feast is a goat, bought as a necessary condition by in- stalments. It should never, never be bought by cash. The goat must be entirely black, not even a single spot of other colour is agreeable to 'Pak Hitam' (by the way, 'Pak Hitam' means 'Mister Black', so a black goat is consistent with his feature). (Maarof 1971, pp. 9-11) The report above is consistent with the findings of our research in 1981. When the ritual was performed, the same sequence of activities was repeated. A goat was slaughtered on the island and sacrifices were made by a Malay pawang of the area. The offering to "Pak Hitam" did not comprise the entire goat, but pieces from different parts of the goat - from the internal organs (including the guts), the thighs, the legs, the tail, the skin, and the whole head - which were laid out on a metal tray with lumps of beras kunyit (saffron rice). Forty participants went to the island in two boats, but the actual offering in the cave was performed by four men, headed by the pawang. The offering was done in a rather casual manner. The pawang laid down the tray at the entrance of the cave and said: Here is the food that you asked for, Pak Hitam; may this simple offering meet your satisfaction for it is all that we can afford and we hope you like it. If, due to our ignorance, we are wrong, please do not be angry, because we are from a different world and we are not familiar with your adat (customary ways). Maybe with this offer, we and our children and our grandchildren can be safe (selamat) and be blessed with good catches in the coming years. While the pawang was conducting the ritual, the other participants</page><page sequence="11">72 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 cooked the remaining parts of the goat and a feast of curried goat and rice was served after the four men returned from the cave. An impor- tant condition of the ritual is that all the food that is prepared must be completely eaten. Leftovers cannot be taken back by anybody. The ritual (that is, the actual offering) took about ten minutes while the cook- ing and the feast took half a day. It was interesting to note that after the feast, a prayer, essentially Islamic in form, was said by one of the older participants. It is worth noting that the participants in fact did not see the Islamic-animistic contradictions in the practice. Ideologically, the domain of God and spirit remained separate and distinct. While uPak Hitam" was a specific localized spirit which needed to be enter- tained and appeased with offerings, the Islamic prayers were part of a worldly, routinized system of showing gratitude and love for God. Ritually and symbolically, however, both rites were part of the same ritual of spirit propitiation, for food offerings to "Pak Hitam" had to be "officially" completed with a vote of thanks, in gratitude for his acceptance of their offering and agreement to protect them. A year later, a rather interesting development occurred in Kampung Nelayan. A wave of opposition and scepticism about "Pak Hitam" and the ritual of propitiation developed following the spread of Islamic revivalism in Telok Kumbar. It created a serious split in opinions and ideas on the necessity and importance of the propitiation ritual. The rejection of this animistic rite of propitiation not only showed a tendency towards Malay "emancipation" from public expressions of animistic beliefs, but also an increasing trend towards orthodoxy in Islam. Significantly, most of these trends in "rethinking animism" did not orginate from the fishing community itself but from a small group of Malay professionals whom the fishermen refer to as orang darai or "land people".4 The latter category is easily definable; they comprise newcomers who are wage-earners, including teachers and government officials. The orang darai command more influence and authority on account of their professional and educational status and ability to obtain regular earn- ings. For the majority of fishermen, to deny the views of the orang darai about Islam would be to expose their own intellectual limitations. Against this tide of orthodox opinion, the importance of animistic rituals (as, it might be added, expressions of the fishermen's "communality") gave away to religious orthodoxy. A minority, who refused to go along</page><page sequence="12">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 73 with the tide of opinion originating from the literate minority, felt that these "outsiders" who were unconnected with fishing, were insensitive to the psycho-social traumas of fishing and fishing-related activities.5 Eventually, however, animistic rituals concerned with maintaining the ideological equilibrium between man and sea became subsumed under revivalist trends in Islam.6 The gradual disregard for "Pak Hitam" on Pulau Kendi was looked upon with regret not only by Malay ritual practitioners of the area but also by Chinese trawler fishermen who maintained good relations with the Malays on account of their common allegiance to this awesome sea spirit. Though they did not participate directly in the ritual, they have always been impressed by Malay anthropomorphic ideas and rituals relating to the sea. Indeed, the legend of "Pak Hitam" is circulated amongst the Chinese fishing community of Penang island from Telok Kumbar to other fishing areas in the south and northeast districts of the island at Teluk Bahang. Chinese reverence for Malay sea spirits explain their use of the honorific title, Datuk for "Pak Hitam" and other spirits gracing Malay shrines or keramats. As an expression of their faith in "Pak Hitam" in controlling good or bad fortune in fishing, a number of Chinese fishermen eventually approached the pawang who had con- ducted the ritual previously and asked if they could hire him to con- duct the ritual for them at the island. Bearing in mind that propitiation rituals surrounding "Pak Hitam" have never really involved monetary transactions, and that such transactions are tabooed (pantang larang), it was surprising that the pawang agreed to the arrangement. Obviously here, the cash payments for conducting the ritual were an important economic consideration. It also meant that for hard-core Malay fishermen who believed in the powers of "Pak Hitam", they could con- tinue to maintain their allegiance to the spirit while satisfying influen- tial outsiders (the orang darai) that they were not really participating in animistic rituals in the old way. Both groups were satisfied with this arrangement, with Malays as ritual brokers and the Chinese, the new patrons of the spirits. Despite the maintenance of congenial relations on the ritual level, and the mutual sharing of anthropomorphic ideas associated with Malay (rather than Chinese) animistic beliefs, the new roles played by the Malays and Chinese where spirit worship was con- cerned in reality accentuated the ethnic differences between the two com-</page><page sequence="13">74 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 munities. To the Malays, this arrangement revealed the emerging class differences between the two groups of fishermen, Malay and Chinese, for the Chinese could afford to pay them vast amounts of money because they were trawler fishermen whose equipment and machinery assured them of a larger catch and greater profits. They were able to "buy over" "Pak Hitam" and maintain him in a new luxury the Malays could not afford. Their attitude towards the ritual was based on Chinese pragmatic ideas of the efficacy of ritual involving prayers and rites of propitiation obtained through money transactions. In response to this attitude, and coupled with the knowledge that the fishing community was really dependent on Malay skills at perform- ing these rituals, the pawang increased his fees and demanded more food items for the kenduri (chicken, fruits, and so forth), some of which were taken home from the island. The Chinese, who did not fully understand the reasons behind these demands, acceded to them. To the Chinese, however, the Malays were indeed short-sighted to give up the ritual prac- tices associated with "Pak Hitam". They would not be assured of a good catch or of good luck during fishing. They would also be unable to get out of any situation of misfortune should one occur because "Pak Hitam" was no longer with them. Thus, though both fishing com- munities were converging ideologically at some point and sharing to some extent a common world-view, the new division of roles in ritual action also served to accentuate at the same time the ethnic differences between the two. Ethnic stereotypes of social and economic differences, for example, were more visibly observed. The phenomenon of the Chinese taking over discarded Malay animistic rituals, shrines (keramats), and saintly cults, and converting them to Chinese tokong is not unusual, at least in Penang. It is well known throughout the Malay and Chinese rural population of Penang that most of the spirits (generally referred to as Datuks) and the spirit- huts or keramats in Tanjung Tokong and Batu Ferringhi maintained by Chinese fishermen were in fact Malay keramats decades ago. Signifi- cantly, the transfer of ownership of these spirits from the Malay to the Chinese coastal population reflects increasing disparities not only of origin and religion, but also of class. Predictably, the declining involve- ment of Malays with animistic rituals relating to the sea coincided with declining activities in fishing and fishing-related activities. Islamic</page><page sequence="14">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 75 revivalism merely accelerated these new developments in the Malay fishing industry in Penang. However, the situation was complicated by the fact that the fishermen of Telok Kumbar continued to believe in "Pak Hitam", if not publicly at least privately. Indeed, there was some resentment, felt by the Malays, over this new congenial relationship which the Chinese now managed to enjoy with "Pak Hitam". In 1984, during a fishing expedition the pawang was lost at sea and his body never retrieved. The Malay fishing community at Telok Kum- bar held intense discussions over it and concluded that it was a final act of retribution from "Pak Hitam", who had expressed his wrath at being used in a commercial venture and over the transfer of ritual allegiances. After many private discussions amongst them and with the Chinese fishermen, it was finally decided that both parties should kongsi (share) "Pak Hitam", where the Malays would give whatever they could afford, in time and effort to maintaining the sea spirit, while the Chinese would contribute money in more modest amounts. Thus, both com- munities were appeased in the short term. Apart from the adoption of the spirit and the ritual associated with it, by the Chinese, the trans- cultural fusion of ideas and rituals on this level is indicated by the con- tinuing concern and anxiety shown by the Malay fishing communities in the powers of "Pak Hitam" and the belief that his wrath had been incurred through the abuses of the propitiation ritual which, for a while, had failed to follow traditional codes of pantang larang. Conclusion: Transculturalism as Ideological and Ritual Mediation Ideologically then, the Malay fishing community had not discarded their animistic beliefs. Indeed, they became more concerned with these beliefs as the Chinese showed more interest in them. An ideological fusion was, thus, evident in the merging of the world-views of the two ethnic com- munities centring on a shared set of animistic beliefs, unifying the Malays and Chinese in a joint venture of ritual activity. Nevertheless, at another level of conceptualization, the different values of the two ethnic com- munities remain strong, aided by class differences and national trends in politics and religion. Transculturalism, employing ideology and ritual</page><page sequence="15">76 SOJOURN VOLUME 3 NUMBER 1 as mediatory forces, does not reduce ethnic consciousness if external socio-economic forces continue to create optimum conditions for dif- ferentiation and separation amongst the major ethnic groups in the country. Notes This study is based on a larger study which was conducted at Telok Kumbar, Penang, between 1981 and 1983 and was initially presented to UNESCO as part of a series of studies on "Inter-Cultural Systems and Ritual Change". The original study was co-ordinated by Wazir-jahan Karim and included work by Professor Tkib Osman and Dr Ot√≥me Hutheesing. 1 One need only to refer to some of the jampi-jampi or chants of some rituals to notice how the elements of Islam are neatly incorporated with animistic beliefs. Similarly, a content analysis of any classical Malay legend will show how the elements are fused into one logico-meaningful scheme (see Tham 1977). 2 Most ceremonial and ritual activities that were gradually banned related to the activities of the pawang ("village shaman") which were performed publicly with the support of villagers or a group of kinsmen and included the lancar kuningy semangat padi, ancak, and tukar ganti. Animistic ritual acts relating to witchcraft, sorcery, and oracles practised on an individual basis within the household, continue to be performed. 3 Generally, the change in the economy of the area is noticeable in the reluc- tance of youths to engage in fishing. Education is the main reason for this occupational discontinuity. Youths in the village, after finishing secondary school education, are not inclined to take up fishing as a full-time source of livelihood and, in fact, consider fishing a "low-class" job associated with the older generation. 4 The broad categorization that prevails now is that between orang kerja laut and orang kerja darat - "people who work at sea" and "people who work on land". 5 Significantly, the Village Security and Development Committee is headed by ex-policemen, and three of the six ordinary members are teachers. Similarly, the majority of the committee members of the dominant local political party comprises ex-servicemen, teachers, and government clerical officers. 6 The individuals referred to as orang darat act as brokers of information between the community and outside, and within the community. They are</page><page sequence="16">RITUAL, ETHNICITY, AND TRANSCULTURALISM IN PENANG 77 also more inclined to be influenced by the mass media and new literature on Islam which is circulated.
