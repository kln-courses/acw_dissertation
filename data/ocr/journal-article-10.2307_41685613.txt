<plain_text><page sequence="1">KARLY During historians I century, the Western focused first half archaeologists the of the present and and art I century, Western archaeologists and art historians focused on the Tsinghai and Kansu provinces of northwestern China for the study of Neolithic culture. Today, despite radical changes in opinion and areas of study, the early ceramic wares from Kansu continue to attract scholarly attention and inVite analyses. These wares are distinctive in form with flowing contours and pleasantly complementary deco- ration. The Avery Brundage Collection at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco includes several excellent examples which can now be re- evaluated in the light of the most recent studies and controlled discoveries made on Chinese soil. Owing to an excavation reported in 1972 in particular, these ceramics are now seen in a more accurate cultural context, and the general picture of the northwest Neolithic area is enlarged. The first definitive evidence that China had a Neolithic culture was discovered in 1921 by Johan Gunnar Andersson, the pioneering Swedish archaeologist and geologist. In Honan province at Yang-shao-ts'un (which mislead- ingly became the eponymous site for the 46 Neolithic period in northern China), Anders- son discovered examples of red pottery painted with black designs; he identified these pieces as Neolithic. In 1923, in the Pan-shan hills south of Lan-chou in Kansu province, he made even more spectacular finds in a well-recorded grave site, that of Pien Chia Kou. There he found vessels with reddish fabric and painted black designs; he immediately linked these to his pre- vious finds, calling them all "Yang-shao" and dating them contemporaneously. Andersson's work was followed by Nils Palmgren's Kansu Mortuary Urns of the Pan Shan and Ma Chang Groups (Peking 1934), a detailed analysis of the forms and designs of painted ceramics from northwest China that is still a useful compendium. Only a small part of Palmgren's evidence is based on Andersson's well-excavated grave; much of it, both vases and information, was obtained from the local Mus- lims, who plundered other graves in the Pan- shan area. The remaining ceramics discussed in Palmgren's study were purchased either in China or in the West. Ironically, the interest generated by Palmgren's and Andersson's work and the subsequent enthusiasm of collectors for</page><page sequence="2">PAINTED POTTERY from Northwest China in the Avery Brundage Collection By CLARENCE F. SHANGRAW Kansu painted pottery proved, in part, respon- sible for the difficulty there is today in assessing this pottery with any degree of accuracy; for its popularity led to its exploitation by peasant diggers, who, it is distressing to report, dis- turbed many of the archaeological deposits in the area. As so often happens in scientific research, Andersson's pioneer conclusions have been shown to be fallacious. Generally speaking his errors derive from three factors: the limited number of reliable sites on which he based his hypotheses, the second-hand nature of some of the information he used and his desire to inter- pret the decoration in a symbolic manner. Chinese studies of the last two decades and the re-assessment by some Western scholars of Andersson's work have now achieved compara- tive stratification and artifact analysis for the remains of the Kansu cultures, as well as radiocarbon datings for the combustible mate- rials from Neolithic strata. (The radiocarbon results are cited later as reference points only; I do not wish to join the controversy over the radiocarbon dating method and its various modifications.) The Kansu Late Neolithic culture is now be- lieved to cover a span from the latter half of the third millennium to about the seventeenth cen- tury b.c. Chinese archaeologists have shown be- sides that the Kansu cultures - Ma-chia-yao, Pan-shan, Ma-ch'ang - are later than the Yang-shao Neolithic cultures of the Honan and Shensi provinces in the central plains area and are directly antecedent to other late-developing northwest painted pottery cultures - Hsin-tien, Ssu-wa, Ch'i-chia - which penetrate well into the historical Bronze Age. Other recent dis- coveries (i.e., foundations of houses, remains of kilns as well as stone and jade implements) in undisturbed Ma-chia-yao strata suggest that the Kansu cultures are western extensions of cul- tures in the central plains. The Neolithic family of ceramics in north- west China, the majority of which have come to light through uncontrolled excavations, con- sists of both mundane corded wares and more abundant refined painted potteries. In the Avery Brundage Collection the latter group is represented by seven superb examples; there are five Pan-shan vessels of the second stage of development and two of the even later 47</page><page sequence="3">Pan-shan urn (B60 P1836) in the Avery Brundage Collection, from Kansu, China.

Ma-ch'ang phase, but the earliest phase, the Ma-chia-yao, is yet to be exemplified. Pan-shan vases, characterized by several shapes, are all much alike because of the restric- tive construction techniques that were used to make them. Among the most common forms is a somewhat squat, thin-walled urn with a fairly wide mouth and a wide belly with loop handles set low on the ovoid body. There is also a form which is similar in body, but has a smaller mouth and a taller neck. A smaller-bodied vari- ation of this latter type has an even taller neck, a well-turned lip and small serrated lugs. A deep bowl, of a depressed ovoid shape, has a wide mouth and loop handles extending from the rim to the shoulder. All Pan-shan vases are made from finely tex- tured clay which fires to a strong earthenware hardness of reddish-brown or buff color. They have well-polished surfaces, which are brush- painted with mineral pigments. All have nar- row flat bases. The lower part of each vessel is always left undecorated. The interiors of the vases often provide evidence of their construction. They were made by the assemblage method - the bottom half was built of a series of coils, and traces of paddle- or spatula-like marks indicate that the interior surface was smoothed upward from the bottom. The upper half was similarly made, and smoothing marks indicate where the two parts were joined. This line of juncture - smoothed and often covered with finger impressions - 48 always coincides with the widest girth of the vessel; it may therefore be concluded that the distinctive profile of Pan-shan urns depends more on the construction method than on artistic choice. The rims and necks, separately shaped and applied, were frequently turned on a rudimen-</page><page sequence="4">Long-necked Pan-shan vase (B60 P2272) in the Avery Brundage Collection, from Kansu, China.

Circular striations indi- cate such regular turning. Similar striations on the base of the vessels show that they were also turned on a wheel during the final smoothing process. The loop handles were made from small, flattened coils of clay, fitted over a dowel-like object and pinched flat at either end. On many jars, the removal of the dowel left marks on the wet clay. The decoration on Pan-shan vessels is always complementary to the shape and emphasizes the generous and flowing contours. Indeed, so harmonious is the effect that these embellish- ments are considered superior in quality and beauty to those on all other Chinese Neolithic wares. One of the most popular of the Pan-shan decorations is a swirling design that covers the upper part of the vessel; major inverted S-shaped lines have been attenuated to con- verge on circles, and this movement is echoed by a secondary set of parallel bands which, be- cause of spatial limitations, create patterns of inverted and everted V's to enhance the swirl- ing movement. Each set of bands contains a red band and a black one with a serrated edge. In addition, there are garland-like bands below the main decoration of the body and at the rim. The suggestion has been made that these deco- rations should be viewed from above for the most pleasing visual effect. Another recurrent type of decoration occurs on a long-necked vase; here the design is painted in irregularly shaped panels resembling double gourds - in Chinese, hu-lu. The panels are outlined in red and are filled with a black trellis pattern. A third motif is the simple garland. The body of a bowl in the Brundage Collection (B60 49</page><page sequence="5">Pan-shan urn (B67 P14) in the Avery Brundage Collection, from Kansu, China. Height, 16% inches; diameter, 17 inches. P2270) is embellished by a wide garland accom- panied by a dentiform pattern in reserve (in the natural color of the clay fabric, which is left unpainted); this dentiform pattern is repeated on the neck of the bowl. In comparison to the circular, sweeping designs on the previous ex- amples the decoration here is rather sluggish. The garland design is certainly not unusual in the Pan-shan decorative repertoire, but in its form and its quiet tone the bowl can be aligned more appropriately with an identical vessel at- tributed to the subsequent Ma-ch'ang phase by the Chinese scholar Ma Ch'eng-yuan. The clay 50 of the bowl, which is yellowish gray instead of the usual Pan-shan reddish brown or buff, sup- ported the idea that this vase belongs to a later period. Perhaps the wide garland with the denti- form pattern in reserve should be regarded as transitional in the history of Neolithic motifs. The Ma-ch'ang phase is represented in the Brundage Collection by two excellent vases. This type of painted pottery was first discov- ered in Tsinghai province, at the site of Ma-ch'ang yen in the Yellow River Valley. The</page><page sequence="6">Ma-ch'ang urn (B60 PI 110) in the Avery Brundage Collection, from Tsinghai, China. Height, 14 inches; diameter, 12 inches. ware is not restricted to that isolated place, as Andersson believed, for examples of it have been discovered over an extensive area in both eastern Tsinghai and Kansu provinces. The remains of Ma-ch'ang and Pan-shan painted pottery have been found together at many sites, although usually the Pan-shan pieces have un- derlain the Ma-ch'ang examples. Compared to the Pan-shan predecessors, the Ma-ch'ang vases have sleeker contours and thinner walls, characteristics which attest to better control over construction and the development of a more efficient wheel. Ma-ch'ang clays are grayish and often slightly gritty or coarse; the vessels are covered with a buff slip which is overpainted with iron and manganese pig- ments. These pigments are what produce the luxurious purplish-brown tonality. An urn in the Brundage Collection displays one of the most common designs in the Ma-ch'ang repertoire, a rudimentary motif re- sembling an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic shape, confined to the upper part of the vessel. This figure seems to have bent limbs extending from a straight-line torso; the lower limbs ap- pear to be tufted. Between these stick-like head- 51</page><page sequence="7">Ma-ch'ang jar (B66 P40) in the Avery Brundage Collection, from Chu-chia-chai, Huang-chung- hsien, Tsinghai province. Height, 5% inches; diameter, ôVà inches. less figures are circles filled with a net pattern. Only one of the seven Chinese Neolithic vases in the Brundage Collection is supported by a certified document of excavation; it is a small jar, discovered in 1949 by Professor Richard C. Rudolph in the vicinity of Chu-chia-chai in eastern Tsinghai province. Like several other examples known to be from that area - and also associated with the Ma-ch'ang phase - this jar has a squat body with a large mouth, a low cylindrical neck with loop handles and decora- tion that almost covers its entire surface. The decor consists of a geometric design done in black pigments directly on a smooth surfaced clay. There are five consecutive sets of concen- tric circles, the innermost of which is filled with a crisscross design that resembles a net. The outer perimeters of the largest circles touch other decorative elements, and this adds coher- ency to the overall design. The neck and up- right loop handles are painted in black; the exterior of the neck has a band of circles in reserve, while the interior is adorned with zig- zags near the rim. Below these is a series of broken curves resembling double garlands. Concentric circles enclosing the net pattern and a band of isolated circles in reserve were motifs widely used on Ma-ch'ang ware. 52 The archaeological programs which the Chinese have undertaken during the last twenty years are unlike those of any other coun- try in history. Their finds and interpretations have forced a drastic revision of many long- cherished opinions. Especially relevant here are the recently discovered remains of a Pan-shan dwelling and its contents, both of which have yielded invaluable information on Neolithic China. The excavation above the village of Ch'ing-kang-ch'a, not far from Lan-chou, was particularly significant to the Chinese because it yielded the most extensive finds of Pan-shan and Ma-ch'ang remains since 1950. Positioned on a plateau above a river valley, very much like the Pan-shan "grave-fields" discovered in Andersson's time, the Ch'ing-kang-ch'a sites were fortified by natural escarpments and have a plentiful water supply from the natural springs, drainage creeks and nearby rivers that feed the upper watershed system of the Yellow River. Four extensive trenches were excavated in the fall of 1963 by an archaeological team from Peking University's Department of His- tory, but the dig was not reported in ar- chaeological journals until March of 1972. Pan-shan remains were encountered at depths from 0.47 to 1.05 meters. The clear stratigraphy and the conditions of the artifacts also allowed the identification of remains from the Ma-ch'ang and later Ch'i-chia phases as well. There were indications that the occupa- tion of the house had ended abruptly, and the excavators assumed that the devastation was caused by an earthquake, since quakes in that area are not uncommon. The artifacts were found distributed about the dwelling in normal fashion, which lends support to the thesis that the house was abandoned in haste. In addition to several stone implements, the excavators re- covered three painted pottery kuan- jars which are similar to one in the Avery Brundage Col- lection (B67 P14); unfortunately, however, all three were broken during the collapse of the house. Reconstructed, these examples show all the characteristics common to pottery of the Pan-shan type, including in the decoration the basic motifs of spirals and circular units with crisscrosses, wavy lines or checkerboards. The site also yielded nine examples of corded pot- tery similar to the central plains type. The entire lower portion of one of the painted pottery kuan-jars was found resting in</page><page sequence="8">One of the three reconstructed Pan-shan jars from the Pan-shan house excavated near Ch'ing-kang -ch'a. Plan of Pan-shan house excavated near Ch'ing-kang-ch'a: (1) to (3) painted pottery kuan-jars; (4) to (10) coarse pottery kuan-jars; (11) to (12) "banded" pottery plates; (13) pottery blade with circular perforation; (14) stone scraper with circular perforation; (15) stone ax; (16) sandstone grinding block. the residue from the embers of a charcoal pit situated in the house; this fragment still con- tained commonplace remains - pulverized cereal congee and assorted herbs, which were doubtless among the householders' food. This important discovery showed what was not con- clusively known before - that the painted pot- tery was used for everyday domestic purposes; Andersson was wrong, then, in believing that all Pan-shan jars were used as "mortuary urns," a belief he based in part upon the information given to him by local Chinese. The discovery also repudiates his interpretation of the dog- toothed serrated pattern as a "death pattern" (the dentiform pattern). It would appear that the Pan-shan peoples made no discrimination between secular and funerary use of their painted pottery designs. Several thousand feet from the ruins of this dwelling, the excavators uncovered the remains of a kiln of the Pan-shan phase. The evidence seems to indicate that the chamber was a sunken one, with flues running straight up or diago- nally away from the fire pit and that it was more or less round in shape, with a level floor, measuring 1.6 by 1.45 meters. The surround- ing red-burned walls suggest a simple oxidation kiln. Because of the small size, only a few pots could be fired at a time, and stacking would have been impossible. For the most part, the sherds found inside the chamber were slipped painted pottery. The body walls, made of well- levigated clays, were typically compact and thinly worked. In the stratum containing the Ma-ch'ang ar- tifacts, the remains of a house and of another kiln were found; the kiln had been mostly de- stroyed perhaps also by an earthquake, and only one "fire passageway" survived intact. From what remained, the chamber's configura- tion approximated that of the earlier kiln, but it was smaller in size. Of the few sherds recovered, the majority belonged to the Ma-ch'ang class. The respective locations of the kilns and the dwellings suggest the existence in both peri- ods of small communities, each with its kiln conveniently situated near at hand. F inally, a most distinctive cave-type house and two graves were found in the stratum iden- tified with the later Ch'i-chia culture. The house, which was scooped out of the hillside, consisted of a square outer room and a round inner room; this double-room type of house is similar to second-phase dwellings found at K'o-sheng-chuang, near Sian in Shensi prov- ince, and provides additional support for a postulated link between the central plains and the northwest traditions. Perhaps the most important of all the finds at Ch'ing-kang-ch'a are the remains of the char- coal fire pit and the remains of construction 53</page><page sequence="9">timbers in the Pan-shan dwelling. Pieces of the timber were tested by the radiocarbon dating method and produced a result equivalent to 2065±100 years b.c. This was the first attempt in China to ascertain a concrete date for Pan- shan remains, and it shows conclusively that those of Pan-shan are earlier than those of Ma-ch'ang or relatively close to their period. Such results negate Andersson's theories that the two wares were products of totally different cultures. In his initial work, he included the Pan-shan culture in the Yang-shao phase and dated it from 3200 to 2900 b.c. He construed the Ma-ch'ang culture as a phase in itself and dated it from 2900 to 2600 b.c. He later revised these sets of dates to 2200 to 1700 b.c. and 1700 to 1300 b.c., respectively. His main justification for separating the two cultures was his belief that no connection existed between Ma-ch'ang residences and the Kansu graves. With the finds at Ch'ing-kang-ch'a and the radiocarbon dat- ings, the picture changes. It should be added that today Chinese archaeologists regard the Ma-ch'ang phase as simply a late stage in the Neolithic context of Kansu province; in some instances, they even parallel the Ma-ch'ang phase with the remains of the yet later Ch'i-chia culture. Andersson wished to classify the periodization of Ma-chia- yao, Pan-shan and Yang-shao all together; recent excavations of undisturbed Ma-chia-yao strata, however, proved them to be distinct from Yang-shao strata. While there is a culturally clear connection between Ma-chia-yao, Pan- shan and Ma-clťang - indeed, the latter two are essentially late phases of the former - these three phases, taken together, have no such relationship to Yang-shao. Therefore, in order to make a clear distinction between the Kansu Neolithic and the central plains Yang-shao, it is best to think of the former as a single cultural unit and to refer to it specifically as the Ma-chia- yao culture. This serves to individualize the northwest's late culturalization, which devel- oped, relatively speaking, independently of China's generative center, but not without contacts with and influences from that area. On the basis of these revisions, it may then be concluded with reasonable safety that the Neolithic painted pottery in the Avery Brun- dage Collection ought to be considered pro- ducts of the Ma-chia-yao culture, which dates in the main from roughly 2200 to 1700 b.c., even though the earliest pottery example from this culture dates to 2600 b.c. The collection's 54 Ma-ch'ang urn (B60 PI 110) may possibly date as late as 1500 b.c., to judge from the similarity of its major decorative motif to those on some sherds from the Liu-li-ko site, datable to the middle Shang period. In the present state of knowledge, an iconog- raphy cannot be established for this pottery. If the decorations considered here are intended to have any symbolic meaning, it is definitely not of the sort Andersson originally proposed. On the other hand, their aesthetic power is en- tirely beyond dispute: the sweeping curvilinear rhythms and delicate strokes of the brush may perhaps be visual counterparts to Neolithic man's sense of rhythm in dance and music. Whatever these motifs represent, the impact of their beauty remains undiminished to this day.
