It further considers the persisting relevance of the specifically Hellenic inheritance of philosophy as contemplation and the Delphic exhortation, "Know thyself!" It concludes with reflections upon the role of imagination in relation to the philosophical idea of God as the supreme and transcendent causal principle of the physical cosmos. Keywords: imagination, self-knowledge, wonder, Cambridge Platonism, reflec tion, theism. The discipline of philosophy is commonly viewed as an organ of enlight enment. One sometimes hears the remark that the pre-eminent task of philosophy is to demystify and dismantle error and superstition. Theol ogy, by contrast, has been adding to mystery through the centuries. Such ridicule of the erstwhile Queen of the Sciences has been reinforced by the legacy of the historical Enlightenment and the motto of enlightenment expressed by Kant of sapere aude (dare to know). According to this view, the audacity and spirit of searching criticism of philosophers contrasts with the docile obscurantism of the theologians. Yet the Greek roots of the term "philosophy" might serve as a warning against any complacency. The wise are the gods. We mortals practise philosophy because we aspire to the divine. Notwithstanding its current prestige in our culture, it might be argued that contemporary philosophy is in a more precarious position than the ology. Whether God or the gods exist, religion certainly does. Given the importance of religion as a fact about our cultural inheritance or a com ponent in politics and society, the serious study of the great scriptures or history of religions is easily justifiable. The skills required for theology are primarily philological-exegetical or historical-philosophical. These can be employed without any consideration of, or belief in, God, the soul, or salvation as abstract entities. Theology has indeed lost much of its ancient esteem, but the justification of the subject area is quite simple. If religion © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="2">REFLECTION, IMAGINATION, LOVE OF WISDOM 113 was, and continues to be, a force in human affairs, its study in the humani ties must be valuable. The big question of the Enlightenment is the status of religion. Indeed, the term "philosophy of religion" was coined at Cambridge in 1678 by Ralph Cudworth. Many of the major philosophical questions are deeply linked to religion. One of the key topics of intellectual debate during the wars of religion and the English Civil War was the role of religion in society. Was religion responsible for violence and wars or was it instituted to control human passions? Could a body politic of atheists function? These questions, mutatis mutandis, remain. Indeed, the fall of the Soviet bloc and the rise of militant Islam remind us of the continued relevance of these questions. The cultural prestige of philosophy is often allied to an ignorance about its contents or methods. What is truth, justice, or knowledge? Are there answers to these questions, and is it even worth asking them? Some of the leading philosophers of the last century were very dismissive of their own inheritance. Had not science succeeded metaphysics just as astronomy superseded astrology? Deflationary accounts of truth or any other major philosophical topic abound. Various figures have attempted to dissolve classical philosophical problems through conceptual analysis or to provide some therapeutic substitute for the traditional worries of epis temology or metaphysics. Most of these reductions have fallen out of favour, but they express a deep worry about philosophy as a subject. Ironically, the failure of various attempts to immunise philosophy proper from metaphysics or theology, especially verificationism and behaviour ism, has led to a revival of more traditional metaphysical topics in the Anglo-Saxon world. Amidst the renewal of more metaphysical questions, it is not clear that God is any less of a genuine philosophical question than that of truth or justice. If the God of Hellenic-Abrahamic monotheism exists—that is, a transcendent and good prius of all being, potential and actual—then this fact has enormous implications for other areas of knowledge, such as ethics. If this ens perfectissimum does not exist, however, it remains a deeply interesting philosophical question why this error exerts such a relentless grip on the human imagination. And not just among the ill educated and pathological but among philosophers from Xenophanes and Aristotle to Kant and Whitehead. The question of the existence of a supreme being is linked to another question about the stuff and methods of philosophy. Does philosophy draw upon the natural sciences or does it draw upon the humanities? This is an ancient question. The proposals of ancient Ionian thinkers were obviously attempts to think about reality in what we today might call scientific terms. "All is water" is a first stab at philosophical naturalism. The first great corpus of philosophical texts is consciously literary. Plato's dialogues are dramas. The manifold forms of philosophy have also varied © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="3">114 DOUGLAS HEDLEY greatly. The earliest philosophy in the West was written in poetry, and in Lucretius's great poem De rerum natura we have a philosophic poem. Spinoza is the instance of a philosopher who operates more geometrico. None of these extremes, neither the poetic nor the Euclidean, has been emulated with much success. I would like to explore the natural affinity that philosophical reflection shares with the religious instinct by considering the idea of wonder. Soc rates was right to think the unexamined life not worth living. The facile optimism that places its trust in higher living standards or the idea that release from religion will generate happiness is absurd. We are anxious and frail creatures, and the bonds of society are fragile. Psychoanalysis has borrowed the philosophical idea that to see problems in their proper perspective (or in Spinozistic terms making our passive ideas active), to become conscious of a problem, is itself a means of its resolution. In Plato's Theaetetus we have the tale of the girl who laughs at the "foolish" philosopher who, while gazing at the heavens, inadvertently falls into a well. The maid's mockery is still relevant. Philosophical reflection is essentially speculative rather than empirical. I am deliberately employing an ocular metaphor in order to emphasise the lack of immediate instru mental value. Such a theoretical consideration of reality is the prerogative of a self-conscious and imaginative animal. I should at this point confess my particular interest in the Cambridge Platonists. They represent a tradition of rational inquiry and genuine piety. As an undergraduate I was exposed to a diet of canonical British empiricism. Rather than sandwiched between Locke and Hume, I now see Berkeley as a middle point between Cudworth and Coleridge: a strand of eloquent critics of empiricism and utilitarianism. Berkeley admired the "learned Dr Cudworth," and Coleridge named a son after the Irish bishop. Coleridge read both Cudworth and Berkeley as a young man. When he began to read Kant and Schelling in the early eighteenth century, his mind was already primed by the forms of idealism he had encountered in the British Platonists. My observations in this essay are unapologeti cally indebted to this Cambridge strand of the philosophy of religion. Against the Thracian Maid The Gods are wise (Phaedrus 278). We are lovers of wisdom because we are lacking in the certainty, ease, and assurance of the gods. It is surprising to undergraduates that the father of Western philosophy could define the subject as the "practice of death" (Phaedo 64a) and "assimilation to God" (Theaetetus 176). Philosophy in the ancient world had a much broader scope than modern philosophy—from an ars vitae to even the longing for salvation expressed in Plato and his school. Given such a definition of philosophy as extending even to the question of salvation, it is not sur prising that early Christians could use the term "philosophy" to describe © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="4">REFLECTION, IMAGINATION, LOVE OF WISDOM 115 their own concerns, while being distinctly nervous about the term "theol ogy," with its distinctly pagan and intellectualist overtones. The scorn of the Thracian maid for the unfortunate Thales expresses the blunt incomprehension of the outsider for the useless activity of contemplation. In Plato's depiction the uselessness of the philosopher is ironic. Socrates asserts that philosophy is the product of wonder (Theae tetus 155; see Pieper 1963, 99ff.). There are two implications of the idea of philosophy as grounded in wonder which are interesting theologically. Firstly, wonder implies a dimension of value or worth in its object. A dedicated follower of Schopenhauer or Sartre might see anxiety or nausea provoking philosophy, but can a thoroughly pessimistic vision of reality sustain wonder? Wonder seems to import an axiological element to the world. Secondly, wonder implies a degree of ignorance and imperfection. The supreme being, presumably, would not be susceptible to wonder. So, the definition of philosophy inspired by wonder fits neatly with the idea that it is part of the longing for a knowledge that we lack. Such a definition is a long way from the confident image of philosophy as clearing the Augean stables of superstition and irrationalism. Many contemporary philosophers see themselves as problem solvers— like natural scientists. This seems to be mistaking the characteristic philosophical vocation. To philosophize is to engage in a reflective activ ity, but it is hardly a domain where one expects to solve problems. The picture of poor Thales is an image of philosophy as contemplative activ ity that requires a certain withdrawal from the immediate concerns of the world. Philosophy is a form of reflection in the sense of the basic etymology reflectere—to bend back—and philosophy is a bending back on questions that force themselves upon uniquely self-conscious beings. It is a dislocation between thought and existence that is drastically cap tured by the ridicule of the Thracian maid. Consider the contrast between morality and desert. We teach our children that virtue should be rewarded and yet we see the flourishing of the wicked. The possession of free will is a deeply rooted intuition, and yet in looking for explanations one feels the pull of determinism. Each human being experiences the vagaries and illusions of sense experience, while the idea of a persisting external world exerts an inexorable pull. While we only have direct access to our minds, most of us believe in the inner lives of others. Such dis location and consequent conflict between subjective impressions and some objective picture of the world generates peculiarly knotty philosophical problems. Know Thyself! Let us take the road from Athens to Delphi, and the god whose temple bears the mysterious inscription "Know thyself!" In Athenian tragedy this was taken in a negative sense, to mean: "Know your limits" and don't ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="5">116 DOUGLAS HEDLEY upset the gods. But it was the philosophers who construed self-knowledge in a positive sense, and it is this positive construal of "Know thyself!" that has played a great role in Western thought since antiquity. One of the most important and defining aspects of the humanities is the development of this critical self-awareness. Especially in the world generated by free creatures—the realm of culture—we are bound to interpret the world in order to understand ourselves. Thus tradition plays a vastly more significant role in the humanities than in the hard sciences. This necessarily hermeneutical dimension of Homo sapiens must cast doubt upon reductionist accounts. For all the attempts to depict the ruthless mechanisms of Homo economicus, one cannot rationally dispose with Homo imaginans. The central question is not consciousness but self-consciousness, and imagination is key to the solution. We are self-understanding creatures and also historical beings. A visit to a European football game or the opera, quite apart from Japanese tea ceremonies or reading about the blood sacrifices among the African Nuer people, provides abundant evidence for the claim that the observable behaviour of human beings is highly ritualised. And rituals are the gradual deposit of imaginative activity. In the plethora of human rituals and symbols, from birth to marriage and burial, human beings exist within an inherited "imaginary" of symbols. It is often observed that the noun "imagination" has a wide range of meanings. There may be not a core meaning to the word "imagination" but rather a family of resemblances. It is not immediately obvious why forming images or forming hypotheses, speculating, or fantasising should all be linked in any interesting manner. Many imaginings, for example, do not require any mental images. If one "imagines" that England might win the Ashes, the supposal does not require any images of English cricketers. Common to all meanings of imagining, however, is an intentional element: imaginings are about items or situations or actions. Intentionality and consciousness have become much more central in philosophical discussion in the past few decades. The context of philosophical reflection upon the concept of imagination has changed radically since the mid-twentieth century and the austere behaviourism of Gilbert Ryle's Concept of Mind (1949). While Aristotle thinks that the command of metaphor marks off poetic genius, he avoids equivocation in his scientific writings. In the modern period Hobbes famously impugns metaphors and tropes as cre ating confusion in science proper. The question is whether symbols and metaphors are necessary and useful for knowledge or are merely ornamental. Should figurative language be restricted to the poet and excluded from more stringent science? Plato's enigmatic use of myths in his dialogues presents a particular instance of this problem, especially in the Timaeus and the Republic. In these dialogues myths are employed at © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="6">REFLECTION, IMAGINATION, LOVE OF WISDOM 117 crucial parts of the text. How do these myths or likely tales relate to reason or logosl Too strict a division between poetry and the natural sciences is unsus tainable. Poetry and the natural sciences are often as perplexing to the Thracian maid as philosophy. A great imaginative construction in a work of art often challenges and reconstructs our ideas about the world. Yet this re-rebuilding of our view of the world has a law-like quality. In a work of imagination there is an element of rightness. The great poet, for example, cannot be merely whimsical and unpredictable. If his or her vision is to be compelling, it must have a logical and moral consistency and its own internal appropriateness. In Shakespeare's great characters, for example, we have changes. Yet these changes are constrained by a need to be "true to life." There is a dimension of the imagination that is not so much the power of fiction or generating unreal scenarios as it is the capacity to experience reality. Philosophy and science work with abstractions that have to be learned. One must acquire a specific vocabulary, largely inherited from the Greeks. But in poetry we are allowed to dwell upon the sense images of our immediate and familiar experience of the world. In this sense, philosophy and science seem abstract, pedantic, and even crabbed when compared to the sensuous immediacy of the poetic image. Plato's hostility to poets is based partly upon this. The Cambridge physicist Ernest Rutherford famously quipped that there is only physics or stamp collecting. Has the materialism or physical ism that has become such a dominant philosophical position in the con temporary world shut off the traditional symbolism of a world suffused with transcendence? There may be much symbolism in the contemporary world—Plato's image of the cave is a most powerful analogy for our world, suffused as it is with images of brands through television, cinema, the Internet, and the like. The powers conveyed by such images are not meant to represent superior immaterial powers. Psychoanalysis may explore these images, but it tends to locate the source of the images in the depths and recesses of human consciousness, not beyond it. Freud, in particular, seems especially sensitive to the pervasive nature of symbolism within human experience, whether normal or pathological, conscious, semi-conscious, or unconscious. The momentous and remarkable triumphs of natural science do not entitle or equip it to explain all phenomena. The physical description of the world excludes the most important fact about experience: conscious aware ness. And for much conscious experience, imagination is a constituent element. The observation of a person, the viewing of a painting, and the listening to a piece of music are all instances of intentional states where consciousness and imagination are virtually synonymous. In all such cases, awareness of the person, painted object, or sounds is to interpret these phenomena as instances of a familiar friend, a painting, or an aria.

Why does art have such prestige if it is so useless? Why does the destruction of Dresden, say, or the ruthless destruction of a beautiful landscape seem so tragic? Is it just because of the loss to potential future observers? The arts provide a mirror to the soul of any society. Holly wood, for example, provides countless instances of a metaphysical hunger draped in mythic garments: alternative dream or virtual worlds, time travel, the moral status of human replicas, and so on. Philosophy and History It is the privilege of the few to possess an idea: of the generality of men it might be more truly said that they are possessed by it. —Samuel Taylor Coleridge, On the Constitution of the Church and State (1976, 13) Plato taught Aristotle, who taught Alexander, who in turn brought Greek paideia to North Africa, the Levant, and the Hindu Kush. That gigantic domain was henceforth open to the radical individualism and universalism of the Stoics and Platonists of the Hellenistic era. Thus St. John could preach the good news of the "pale Galilean" rabbi as the incarnate eternal Logos to a world that had been Hellenised, and his great apostle St. Paul could appeal to the God of the philosophers in Athens. Christian theology became the organ of Hellenic intellectual inheritance—Origen of Alexan dria was as much a philosopher as his contemporary Plotinus, Augustine at least equal to a Cicero or a Seneca. Hence in the middle of the Dark Ages, alongside the Gothic savagery of wergild and ius primae noctis, an archbishop of Canterbury could think up an argument for the real exist ence of supreme perfection (id quo maius cogitari nequit) that has fasci nated philosophers like Godel and Russell. One might further think of the impact of the doctrine of the "rights of man" upon the French Revolution; the philosophy of Marx and the Bolshevik Revolution; or the relations between the philosophy of Nietzsche and Haeckel and the doctrines of the National Socialists. Another example of the impact of ideas upon human society would be the vigorous legal and social assimilation of the disabled. This is a striking application of a tradition of compassion for the outsider or the afflicted that is a characteristically Christian legacy. In many cultures physical impairment is often associated with a blight and malediction (one thinks of the role of the hunchback or the one-eyed pirate in our own Occidental fairy tales and folk tales). In other cultures, the more tender sentiment of compassion is lacking. Indeed, many philosophers, from Machiavelli to © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="8">REFLECTION, IMAGINATION, LOVE OF WISDOM 119 Nietzsche, have contrasted Christian sympathy unfavourably with the toughness of the virile pagans. It often within a culture, however, that one is most blind to its philo sophical assumptions. The Japanese, for example, are said find the Western legal concept of "brain death" counterintuitive. The Asian mind can view such a legal definition as evidence that Occidental culture is in the grip of a tacit Cartesianism that identifies the person with the res cogitans (Steineck 2009, 235). Another example of philosophy shaping a specific culture is found in ideas about the environment. It is sometimes argued that the Hebrew-Christian idea of the stewardship of creation in the dominion of Adam over the land and the animals has generated a culture of exploitation in the wake of the Industrial Revolution that has poisoned and disturbed nature. I cannot in this context comment on the value of such observations, but they seem to be well motivated. The world is "fraught with ought," as Sellars famously claimed (1963, 212). Whether one thinks of values as grounded in the nature of the universe or as projections onto it, ethical issues are ineluctable. Practical issues of scien tific morality such as vivisection, genetic engineering, and euthanasia are just as much a part of philosophy as the more political questions of rights, just war, and justice. Given the pressing need for reflection about such normative issues, one cannot ignore the cultural context in which ideas and principles emerge. The Glass of Reflection There is another pertinent sense of philosophy as reflection: that is, as a mirror. Richard Rorty polemicised against the image of philosophy as the representation or mirroring of nature, a view that he diagnosed as depen dent upon a particular view of the mind's "glassy essence" (1979, 42). Let us remember that the philosopher is etymologically one who loves wisdom. This metaphor of affection is grounded in Plato's Symposium and the ascent to absolute beauty in the speech of Diotima and the divine madness and rapturous contemplation of his Phaedrus. Plato's paradigm of the ascent of the mind has exerted a huge influence. One decisive form of philosophy, with its most eminent proponents in Plato and Plotinus, argues from anomalies and contradictions in our habitual experience of the phenomenal world in order to drive the finite mind towards the tran scendent noetic realm in which these contradictions are resolved. Both thinkers employ sceptical arguments in order to reveal the prima facie solid realm of ordinary experience as transitory and evanescent. The inadequacy and contingency of this realm of shadows leads to an appre hension of that transcendent and necessary reality that lies beneath and beyond the phenomenal world. Philosophy for such thinkers in the Neo platonic tradition is an imaginative activity that is at once radical and creative: leading out of the cave of habitual experience up the divided line ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="9">120 DOUGLAS HEDLEY towards the Good "beyond being." For this reason, both Plato and Plo tinus (or their modern followers like John N. Findlay and Stephen Clark) will often employ thought experiments or poetic images in order to articu late a rational vision of the nature of the intelligible world. On this model, philosophers can resolve the puzzles of philosophy at a higher level. Plato's anhupotheton archen, the Forms, or the Form of the Good, the Kantian noumenal realm, or Hegel's absolute Spirit are examples of this. There is a very significant connection between imaginability and intel ligibility. If Plato is correct to see science as "carving up nature at the joints" and if knowledge emerges not by accident or convention but by penetrating the real essences of the world, we need to consider the world as the kind of arena in which real knowledge is possible. It is hard to imagine science as possible in a world that repeatedly rebuffs any attempt to discover order or meaning within it. For the theist, the intelligibility of the world reinforces the idea of world as created by the divine mind. Thus it is unsurprising that hairless apes can imagine remote and hidden forms of order and come to understand the world and have access to universal laws of the universe. In this way the cosmos produces minds that both imagine and mirror through its glassy essence its intelligible source. It is routinely suggested that the values of duty, honesty, and sympathy are the product of the evolutionary process. But it is much harder to accept that an interest in abstract truth emerges through the bleak and harsh sieve of natural selection. Is it not far-fetched to connect the concern with theo retical knowledge characteristic of human science with the kind of adap tive modification evinced in the giraffe's neck? The astonishing capacity of human beings to imagine hidden structures of being, to observe laws and patterns in observable phenomena, suggests that the world is providen tially susceptible to systematic intellectual inventions of the finite mind. The traditional critiques of philosophical theism revolve around the concept of imagination. Spinoza thinks that theism results from the ille gitimate transfer of personal qualities to the impersonal substance that is deus sive natura. Nietzsche is a more thoroughgoing critic of religion, and he considers man to be a "sick animal" through the enfeebling of his instincts by the religious, in particular the Christian, imaginary. The denial of free will, evil, teleology, and genuine altruism are linked in both thinkers to a theory of the mind's tendency to project illusions onto an otherwise terrifying universe. Freud's theory of religion as wish fulfilment is indebted to this strand of critiques of religion as an illegitimate out growth of a sub-philosophical imagination. In more recent literature, religion has been forcefully presented as a by-product of evolutionary mechanisms. Rather like the employment of the light of a flame by a moth, religion is the case of the misuse of an otherwise reliable mechanism. Just as the moth usually employs light from the moon or stars effectively but dies when it flies into a flame, so too human beings project sympathies and intentions upon agents seen and unseen. Religion becomes a special and © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="10">REFLECTION, IMAGINATION, LOVE OF WISDOM 121 destructive instance of an otherwise useful evolutionary strategy to imagine more than the eye can see or the ear can hear. Many contemporary thinkers of diverse provenance, such as Ronald Hepburn and D. Z. Phillips, have denied that one can imagine a tran scendent being at all. Theism presupposes a capacity to imagine a tran scendent source of the world, and many philosophers deny that imagining the world as an object of inquiry is intelligible. Equally, for Phillips language about a transcendent agent beyond the world relies upon an egregious misuse of language, as such talk of any agent presupposes a community to which the agent belongs and thus criteria of identification. Such problems of imagining the world or God as a transcendent agent are related to metaphysical issues of modality. Obviously, many problems in natural theology are linked implicitly or explicitly with the relation between imagination and conceivability. Symbolism and Transcendence Symbolism is a way in which abstract ideas can be communicated through a culture via the imagination. The ancient and medieval Occidental mind dwelt symbolically. Man was envisaged as suspended between two realms: the earthly and the transcendent. Symbols provided a mediation and an iconic channel between these domains. Light, for example, was a central symbol in the philosophy of the Neoplatonists, especially Plotinus. The figurative dimension of the symbol was in no way disconnected from its metaphysical and epistemic dimension. The metaphysical dimension of light was understood as the lux intelligibilis: the essential intelligibility of the universe. The epistemic dimension, then, was the process and method of attaining discernment, which was contrasted with ordinary ignorance and confusion, and the clarity of thought that enables the mind to analyse and combine, to detect real connections in the objects of the world. The two dimensions of light could be further coupled with the figurative dimension, for example metaphors of blindness and sight, awakening and sleep, and so on. An ancient or medieval mind would in all likelihood have understood the light of the Hagia Sophia, the cathedral of Chartres, or the Commedia of Dante as encompassing all of these dimensions. The visible levels of light in these works were not merely representations of a wholly other reality but were indeed manifestations of that transcendent reality which they symbolised. Drama, prose, and poetry can be regarded as both creative and truth ful. Aristotle is thinking of this when he observes that poetry is more philosophical than history. The great poet presents universal truths of the human condition rather than contingent facts. The emotions that the great fictional works generate are of great interest. Why are we moved by the fate of Hecuba or Hamlet? Aristotle famously thought that the emotions aroused by tragedy could be said to have a purging effect. The sense in ©2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="11">122 DOUGLAS HEDLEY which we are moved by fiction is intriguing philosophically. Why should we be affected by fictional persons or events? And why should this expe rience be regarded as valuable or even purifying? There is an important tradition of viewing great aesthetic works as possessing a strong didactic component. This is mirrored in the Christian New Testament by the parables. These are tales or fictions that convey truths. In John 3.1-21 Nicodemus asks Christ how a man can be reborn. The literalist Nicode mus states that a man cannot return into his mother's womb. Christ is emphatic that Nicodemus must use his imagination if he is to understand the true nature of divine regeneration. The region of philosophy that deals with art is traditionally called aesthetics. But "aesthetics" is a relatively recent development. Medieval and Western philosophy was primarily concerned with the topic of beauty and was often concerned with how this relates to truth and goodness. As Keats famously put it in "Ode on Grecian Urn," Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. Keats was expressing a view widespread in antiquity that beauty must be related to truth. Equally, beauty was thought to be related to good ness. The phrase "the beauty of holiness" of Psalms 29.2 captures this, where the contrast is between this holy beauty and the ugliness of sin. But is difficult to articulate a philosophically robust account of the relations between beauty, truth, and goodness. If Hume is correct that morality is essentially utility, what is "useful or agreeable to the person himself or to others" (1975, 261), it is hard to see how this utility is related to beauty. It is also puzzling for many philosophers why or how beauty might be related to truth. Yet an appeal to the imagination (as opposed to mere fantasy) could show how beauty and truth may be linked. Consider the creative fictions of great artistic beauty, like the works of Shakespeare. Such works aspire to a certain truthfulness. As we have seen, Romanticism has popularised some distinction between imagination and fantasy or fancy. If we wish to highlight the cognitive capacity of the imagination, it is important to distinguish it from those forms of imagination that can throw light upon the world and fantasies that create a mawkish or cruel make-believe. Our emotions can be deep ened or purified by a work of the imagination so that we can gain a clearer understanding of reality, whereas fantasy often indulges and gratifies the emotions without any real challenge. We can inhabit a world of fantasy just as we can inhabit a world constructed by the imagi nation, but we will not be instructed. Human creativity has a negative side. Selfishness, cruelty, anxiety, and fanaticism can be the offspring of fantasy. © 2012 The Author Metaphilosophy © 2012 Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="12">REFLECTION, IMAGINATION, LOVE OF WISDOM 123 The theistic religions all assume a link between beauty, goodness, and truth because all three have their basis in the transcendent reality of God. This is the foundation of the iconoclasm that all three Abrahamic religions share to a greater or lesser degree. The ban upon images of the divine as idolatrous has its foundation in the conviction in the particular power of art to represent the transcendent truthfully and with reserve and awe for the sacred. If art were merely an organ of ornament or amusement, there would be little point in the prohibitions and limits placed upon sacred art in the great religious traditions. There is a tradition going back to Epicurus that views fear as the basis of religion, and theology as grounded in anthropomorphism. But I have been pleading for another strand of Western philosophy, with its trajectory from Plato to Anselm, Dante, the Renaissance, and the Cambridge Platonists, that identifies the supreme object of wonder as the transcendent good that is God and sees philosophy proper as a rational aspiration to the divine. If we are haunted by the idea of absolute perfection in a world of manifest imperfection, this is testimony to the power of the imagination to envisage the ultimate unity of value and existence. Beauty is often defined as the unity of a manifold. In architecture or a dramatic work the harmonious ordering of the parts constitutes much of the beauty of the work. A traditional theist cannot admire a work of art as beautiful if its morality is questionable any more than he or she can admire a work of art if it presents an inherently false or beguiling image of life. The nineteenth-century Oxford philosopher Edward Caird would ridi cule talk of that which was deemed "too good to be true," by retorting that whatever was not true, was not good enough! (See Temple 1924, 14.) For the theist, truth presupposes goodness, and through beauty the mind can rise to a vision of transcendent unity. Yet it takes the work of imagination to remove the veil of phenomena of our habitual experience and to habituate the mind to the presence of the transcendent God of theism in the world.
