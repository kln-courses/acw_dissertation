Leon Trotsky The December 1978 Third Plenum posed fundamental questions of leadership and authority in the Chinese Communist Party. According to the communique and subsequent official statements, the CCP had suffered from an excessive centralization of power in which Mao Zedong's personal authority bordered on "despotism" while the Gang of Four exercised a "Fascist dictatorship "Many important issues were frequently decided by one or two persons," People's Daily asserted, "while the others could only follow their orders."2 But how could Deng Xiaoping and his supporters account for personal dictatorship in a party officially organized on principles of collective leadership (jiti lingdao)?

"We had thousands ... of Communist Party members, particularly a large number of veteran cadres.... Why were they made so helpless by a few clowns such as Lin Biao and the Gang?"4 And, why, even after Mao's death and the Gang's demise, did "patriarchal type figures" still plague the CCP, especially below the central level?5 Going beyond partisan polemics to examine "the causes and conditions engender[ing] the mistakes of the per- sonality cult," the new leadership proposed various solutions to the "over- concentration of authority" in the party, including structural reforms which, if enacted, could fundamentally alter China's authoritarian political system.6 The Problem of Leaders Mao Zedong was, of course, a major target of criticism. Initially reluctant to evaluate the chairman, the new leadership called for a "correct assess- ment of Chairman Mao" in early 1979, including publicized discussion of his autocratic rule.7 Although such official statements as the June 1981 Sixth Plenum "Resolution" treated Mao's tenure as party chief in gener- ally positive terms, this and other documents heavily criticized his leader- ship from the late 1950s on. Beginning in 1957-58, Mao reportedly became an increasingly "arbitrary" and "imperious" leader, shattering the procedural framework for handling policy disagreements that had existed at the CCP's top levels since the mid-1940s. Obsessed with his revolution- ary vision, Mao circumvented central channels of deliberation and decision by issuing personal directives (zhishi) on major policy questions. After the January 1958 Nanning Conference, Liao Gailong claims: Comrade Mao Zedong no longer participated in the meetings of the Politburo [but] only listened to reports and delivered speeches....

It seemed that everyone was wrong, that only he himself adhered to Marxism.8 Although other party leaders attempted to reverse Mao's patriarchal sys- tem (jiazhang zhidu) at the 7000 cadres conference in 1962, their effort apparently failed to undermine his personal domination of party decision making.9 By May 1966 "Mao Zedong's personal leadership characterized by 'left' errors took the place of collective leadership of the Central Com- mittee and the cult of Mao Zedong was frenziedly pushed to an ex- treme."10 With an "overconcentrated power" in the party, the stage was thus set for the rise of the Leftist radicals. "If Chairman Mao had not expressed the need for worship," Wang Ruoshui stated in 1979, "it would have been impossible for Lin Biao and the 'gang of four'. . . to climb to the leading position of party and state."'I Yet, the problem was not just Mao or even the radical leftists. Without the tacit complicity of other central leaders-many now back in power- the nearly two decades of personal dictatorship would never have oc- curred. "Of course, it must be admitted," Hu Yaobang stated in 1981, "that both before the 'Cultural Revolution' and at the time of its inception, the party failed to prevent Comrade Mao Zedong's erroneous tendency from growing more serious but, instead, [we] accepted and approved of some of his wrong theses. We veterans . . . are keenly aware of our own responsibility in this matter, and . . . are determined never to forget this lesson. " 12 This failure of the central leadership to block Mao reportedly began in the mid- 1950s during the intense debate (zhenglun) over agricultural cooperativization. According to the contemporary journal, Party History Research, top leaders did not follow up their initial opposition to Mao's radical "high tide" policy.13 Despite the apparently widespread consensus among the leadership, including Mao Zedong, for a slowdown and "con- 8.

Yet, even as some top leaders apparently opposed Mao's radical view of cooperativiza- tion as a polarized "struggle between capitalism and socialism," most ac- quiesced to his "unauthorized negation of central decisions," including the subsequent attack on "Rightist Opportunism" at the October 1955 Sixth Plenum.14 "In the atmosphere of the [July and October] meetings no one even bothered to mention the [previous] policy of achieving one-third co- operative formation in each five-year plan; nor did they bring up the cen- tral secretariat's 20 April [1955] decision ordering a temporary 'stop and consolidation' in cooperative work." 15 Following Mao's initial decision to break with the leadership in May 1955, a collective lethargy and amnesia apparently overcame central leaders, making Mao's assertion of individual authority easier. Complicity in Mao's extraordinary policy demands also explained the unwillingness of other leaders to enforce the subsequent ideological and institutional reforms passed at the September 1956 Eighth Party Congress. Although recent commentaries claim Mao fully supported the decision of the Congress to eliminate his thought from the party constitution, other leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, allegedly failed to uphold these deci- sions and stem the tide of the "personality CUlt.1'16 Failing to "heed the spirit of the Eighth Congress," central leaders refused to defend Peng Dehuai's legitimate criticisms at the September 1959 Lushan Plenum.17 Despite recent claims that the leadership planned the Lushan meeting to "correct Leftist mistakes" [i.e., the Great Leap Forward], commentators now lament it "turned into a meeting to criticize Peng Dehuai's Rightist Opportunism-something Deng Xiaoping et al. could have prevented."8 14.

Indeed, why did they switch so quickly in 1956 from "criticizing the personality cult to criticizing the crit- icisms of the personality cult?"19 Addressing this question, recent official analyses first emphasize the impact of international events, especially the 1956 uprising in Hungary, which not only weakened internal opposition to the cult but also reportedly strengthened Kang Sheng's role as its prime instigator (shizuoyongzhe).20 Just as the Chinese leadership responded to events in Eastern Europe with a conservative defense of Stalin and the personality cult, Kang allegedly assumed the critical role of interpreting the new ideological line to the entire party.21 Then, following Peng Dehuai's disgrace at the Lushan Plenum, Kang gave a speech in December 1959 "equating opposition to the party leader with opposition to the per- sonality cult and opposition to Stalin's personality cult with the total re- nunciation of Stalin," apparently without any overt resistance from the very party leaders who had criticized the Stalin cult three years earlier.22 This unwillingness of top leaders to resist the cult in the late 1950s was enhanced by their exaggerated sense of achievement which had also en- couraged Mao's "arrogant" leadership style. Emboldened by "successes" in Korea, land reform, and the Socialist transformation of agriculture, Chinese leaders supposedly "came to see themselves as different from Sta- lin," believing "China would both avoid the heroic leader and achieve Communism."23 Despite their rather intense criticism of the personality cult following Stalin's death in March 1953, Chinese leaders did not gener- ally understand the inherent dangers of vesting the single leader with abso- lute authority.24 Today, party officials reportedly "know" the single 19.

Unable to pen- etrate the iron-clad logic of the cult, Peng and all others attempting to ''speak the truth," were "hit with a calamity" as the "demand to protect the leader's prestige overwhelmed the need to protect the party and peo- ple's interest."28 In short, the failure of top leaders to uphold basic principles of collective leadership not only magnified Mao's personal authority, but also gave Lin and the Gang "the chance to avail themselves of the loopholes and [make] claims to power."29 Once the political foundations of despotism were es- tablished in the late 1950s, the radicals "casually used the leader's name to give orders and attack old revolutionary cadres."30 Indeed, "the reason the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques were able to take shape," Deng Xiaoping stated in 1980, "was ... inseparable from the exist- ence of the remnants of the patriarchal work style within the party."'31 After "worshipping" Mao for years and accepting his every decision, lead- ing cadres offered little resistance to the Gang's construction of a "bureau- cracy with overconcentrated power."32 The political and ideological 25.

XXVII, NO. 7, JULY 1987 foundations of despotism in the CCP were, in other words, well established before the radicals, Hua Guofeng and the "Whatever" faction assumed their leadership roles. In addition to the "confessions" by top leaders, the press also blamed unnamed "senior cadres" at the central level and below for the long his- tory of despotism in the CCP. In a party where the "principal responsible person in [every] leading collective must be worshipped," Mao's expansion of personal authority in the late 1950s had a strong ideological basis.33 Ruling their organizational bailiwicks with an iron hand, these leaders had shared the chairman's contempt for collective principles by supporting the personality cult. Then, unaffected by the chairman's death and the radi- cals' political defeat, they blocked the new leadership's plans for rebuilding institutional authority in the CCP by practicing their own "patriarchal" leadership style. Declaring " 'I am the party'," these little Maos continued to oppose reforms in the decision-making process while allegedly forbid- ding "people from airing opinions on the leaders."34 From a partisan standpoint, this criticism was obviously directed at Deng Xiaoping's major political opponents, especially in 1979-1980. De- spite Deng's admission of his own obsequious obedience to Mao's orders and his contribution to the chairman's "mistakes," party leaders attempt- ing to cast Hua Guofeng in the Maoist mode-i.e., the "Whatever" faction (Fanshi pai)-were the primary targets of this criticism, particularly the attacks on "individual appointment and succession."35 But even after the purge of Wang Dongxing and the demotion of Hua from the party chair- manship in December 1980, the press continued to criticize lower-level party secretaries for their arbitrary decision making in violation of party committee procedures. People's Daily (July 24, 1981), for instance, warned that "the practice of patriarchy" and " 'What I say goes' " pervades the party, while at the 1982 Twelfth Congress Hu Yaobang noted that "patri- archal ways have still not been eradicated....

SULLIVAN 807 cadres still believed "no leadership work could be done" without the "great" leader.37 But on a more fundamental level of analysis, the press also linked the persistence of individual autocracy in the CCP to deeper attitudinal and ideological problems unrelated to Mao or even the Gang. Irrespective of their factional allegiances, many leaders shared, in Deng Xiaoping's words, "a way of thinking" that provided fertile ground for a future despotism. "There are still some people," Red Flag emphasized, "who act like Confucius and 'feel anxious if there is no emperor for 3 days.' "38 Perhaps most disturbing was the party secretaries' weak identification with the "corporate" order of the party. Despite the effort since the 1940s to instill party members with an organizational loyalty transcending indi- viduals, many party leaders below the central level failed to distinguish between institutional and personal authority. According to Red Flag: "Individuals equated themselves with the party or were even above the party" to the point they "could even disregard the prevailing institutions [and] party constitution."39 Relying on personal power and patronage, "some party secretaries behave ... like heads of families, [so that] 'central- ization' changes to 'personalization' [and] the first secretary becomes 'the secretary first.' "40 The institutional authority of the CCP thus suffered enormously, especially the party committees which in "some localities and units are like empty shells."'41 The orthodox Leninist model of the party as an impersonal bureaucratic machine with authority vested in commit- tees was still a distant ideal. This antiinstitutional attitude of senior cadres also reflected their gener- ally poor understanding of basic Marxist-Leninist principles. First ex- pressed in the 1942-44 Rectification campaign, this criticism was directed at party officials who, in espousing a "heroic" vision of history, considered the "leader's intention" more important than "material forces" in deter- mining political change.42 In their conception of the Chinese revolution, these leaders (presumably veterans of the resistance and civil wars) "sin- cerely" exaggerated the role of the individual while ignoring the important contributions of the party and the Chinese people. The Communist vic- tory was a monument, they believed, to the "will" of "a few cadres and a 37. HQ no. 22, Nov. 16, 1980. 38. HQ no. 17, Sept. 1, 1980. 39. HQ no. 17, Sept. 1, 1980. 40.

XXVII, NO. 7, JULY 1987 few party members" to change the course of history.43 Defying the "scien- tific" principles embodied in Marxism-Leninism, party leaders arrogantly took their own "word" as the sole source of truth.44 "'I' am to decide whether an idea is right or wrong" and " 'I' am to decide whether an opin- ion should be accepted or rejected [because] 'I' am always right" reputedly typified the attitude of many party leaders.45 Operating in a conceptual and empirical vacuum, they denied the existence of objective standards of truth and rejected the input of concrete data-especially from nonparty experts-into their often irrational decisions. As long as such "subjectiv- ism" infected leaders, disastrous policies like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution could recur. Yet another attitude inclining leaders to an autocratic style was their tendency to equate political with familial authority. Sixty years after intel- lectuals in the New Culture-May Fourth movements (1916-22) criticized the intertwining of family and polity in China, some CCP leaders still al- legedly confused the roles of the "official" (guan) with the "old father" (laodie).46 "They make the relations . . . between leaders and led into 'relations between father and son'," which turns the CCP into a 'clan or- ganization" where "party discipline" becomes "family discipline."47 Party leaders even asserted their right to "beat up" subordinates just as the auto- cratic father severely punished his son and the eldest son terrorized his younger brother. As an example, the press republished a story in which Mao Zedong had supposedly threatened his younger brother, and party member, Mao Zetan.48 Ignoring the CCP's principles on comradeship and equality, Mao reportedly invoked familial authority to discipline his younger brother on a political matter. "'If it [concerns] family disci- pline', " Mao Zetan supposedly said, then "'in the absence of my parents he can beat me[!]' " But this right did not extend to their relationship as party members, nor should political differences be solved by violence.

SULLIVAN 809 the CCP, discipline should be restricted to political matters and without resort to oppressive, familial authority. Finally, party leaders allegedly contributed to despotism by their inces- sant "love of power." Again the press accused the Gang of promoting this "fascist" element in Chinese politics by advocating the "undisguised selfish philosophy that ... 'power not used will be wasted when the term ex- pires.' "49 Yet, the "insatiable lust for power" in the party was not only a consequence of the Gang's influence, but also reflected many party leaders' basic motivation to aid family and friends.50 Constantly pursuing "pro- motions," many leading cadres disregarded formal committee procedure by willingly accepting the notion that "politics grows out of power." The fixation on power was a widespread problem in the CCP, often unrelated to factional loyalties or ideological persuasion. "Taking power as the sole criterion" was not an invention of the radical Left, but a malady infecting leaders throughout the organization. In short, the press criticized CCP leaders from top to bottom for an autocratic leadership style antithetical to collective decision making and institutional authority. But among post-Third Plenum leaders, considera- ble differences emerged over the causes and severity of these "defects." For more conservative party leaders, the above problems were considered primarily attitudinal and ideological, and thus amenable to conventional intraparty rectification and education, without fundamental institutional reform. Party reformers and "proto-democrats," however, saw these problems, especially the leaders' "love of power," as symptoms of deeper institutional flaws.51 In a view periodically supported by Deng Xiaoping and the press in 1979-80, structural defects were considered the primary cause of the party's slide into despotism. "The various mistakes we made in the past," Deng Xiaoping argued, "were related to the thought and work style of certain leaders, but the problems in organization and work systems [emphasis added] were even more important."52 The corrupting influence of inadequate institutional safeguards affected even the most re- sponsible party leader, for as Red Flag noted: "If the system is bad even good leaders cannot avoid making mistakes, and this will give bad people 49.

XXVII, NO. 7, JULY 1987 the opportunity they seek."53 Unless the system was fundamentally al- tered, the problem of personalistic autocracy in the CCP would persist. The radical thrust of this structural analysis of despotism was apparent when the press challenged the major governing principles of the CCP. The slogan "strengthening the party's unified leadership" had substantially contributed, Red Flag asserted, to excessive authority "in the hands of sec- retaries, particularly the first secretary." "Thus, the party's unified leader- ship often became the leadership of one individual" with the power to "overrule resolutions and decisions by the party and the collective."54 People's Daily made similar criticisms of Leninist "democractic central- ism" that, although "stipulated in the party constitution [as] so-called Marxist-Leninist theory," had reportedly led many party members to "fall willingly into a state of blind obedience. We can see that democracy under centralized guidance can become the theoretical basis to practice autoc- racy and deny democracy."55 Too often in the history of the CCP, Red Flag declared, "we . . . overemphasized opposition to decentralism and independence, but we never [overemphasized] decentralization and self- determination, nor [did we] struggle against an overconcentration of power in the hands of individuals." During the revolutionary war (1927-49), "it was sometimes necessary to give the power of final decision to individuals," but since 1949 it was "obviously improper."56 Similar arguments were made against longstanding practices in the CCP, such as lifetime tenure for leading cadres and the party patronage system. "One characteristic of [lifetime service]," People's Daily asserted, "is to uphold the authority of the individual and reject the authority of the collective. Under these circumstances, the personality cult will increas- ingly prevail . . . 57 "'What I say goes' and the 'iron rice bowl'" were mutually reinforcing components of the same "patriarchal system" which thrived on recruiting "yes" men over men of "talent."58 Where "nepotism replaces appointment on merit," People's Daily noted, "power tends to be- come highly concentrated until ultimately all powers of the Party and state 53.

Excessive personalism in the relations of leader and led was a major breeding ground for patriarchal authority. Finally, advocates of a structural analysis of despotism also considered the overall distribution of power in the political system. For a brief period, the press even criticized the CCP as a single "ruling party" which had reportedly transformed good party leaders from "public servants" into powerful "overlords" with an unbridled "supervisor's will."60 Without competitive parties, some leaders developed an arrogance of power which Lin Biao and the Gang simply "carried to an extreme." The same struc- tural imbalance existed in the relationship between the CCP and the state where "replacing the government with the party" (yi dang dai zheng) con- tributed to Mao's "patriarchal system." Despite periodic criticism dating back to the 1942-44 rectification, the CCP's monopoly of legitimate gov- ernment functions has reportedly "always existed," especially since the 1950s when Mao "said that we must 'centralize power on major issues and decentralize power on minor issues' in order to combat decentralism."61 Where party and government were excessively "integrated," first secretar- ies "grabbed too much power," particularly during the Cultural Revolu- tion when "many administrative personnel . . . well-versed in their professions" were virtually ignored.62 Excessive party domination had also so severely weakened China's fragile legal system that, one legal spe- cialist argued, "law in our country actually reflects the will [emphasis ad- ded] of individual power holders."63 "This law, that law, none are as good as a word from the leader."64 For just as party secretaries wantonly inter- 59.

The loss of control over recruitment and promotions by the party's Organization Department to individual leaders and "the practice of keeping main leading cadres tied to work in a region or department over a long period of time" reinforced "patriarchal behavior" throughout the party.

Unless China shifted from "rule by man" to "rule by law," "nihilism in regard to law [could] spread unchecked" just like "after 1958 [when] Lin Biao and the 'gang of four' availed themselves of the loopholes in our legal system and brought great suffering to the party."65 In sum, 1979-80 witnessed perhaps the most comprehensive critique of the power structure in China since the 1957 Hundred Flowers. As Deng Xiaoping noted in August 1980, the "imperious and despotic" behavior of leaders reflected the lack of "strict administrative regulations . .. or a per- sonnel responsibility system" to "demarcate the jurisdiction of organs and of individuals," which made some "readjustment of power and interests within the CCP . . . an absolute necessity." "Unless we resolutely reform the present defects in the systems," Deng emphasized, "certain serious problems that appeared in the past may arise again in the future."66 The Problem of Cadres Rank-and-file cadres were also criticized for creating a political environ- ment conducive to one-man leadership. To be sure, ultimate responsibility lay with top party leaders: "Among people in political life, some 'sit on sedan chairs' and some 'carry them', but the greatest responsibility for per- petuating this old social habit lies primarily with those who 'sit.' "67 Yet, with their sycophantic political characteristics, party rank-and-file had also contributed to the CCP's degeneration into despotism. Like their superiors, cadres reportedly suffered from an excessive loyalty to individuals that inflated the personal prestige of Mao and local party leaders at the expense of party institutions. Believing that "obeying the party's leadership meant listening to a certain person's words," many cad- res merely "'implement the leader's intention'" while accepting "'what their secretaries say as what counts'."68 "Don't we want the secretary in command?" was indeed a prevalent attitude, especially among "'obedient cadres' [who] say yes to whatever their 'superior' says without reserve.

They just mechanically copy, quote, or recite what the leaders have said."70 Satirically referred to as "shrimpwaists" (because they are always bowing), these obsequious cadres played into the hands of "patriar- chal figures," both past and present.71 This political dependency of cadres derived, in part, from their own "he- roic" vision of history which attributed "all our victories and achievements to individuals."72 More poorly trained in Marxism-Leninism than their superiors, they too "sum ... up history as the independent actions of em- perors, kings . . . and ministers." The deterministic role of impersonal economic forces and mass political action was, in many cadres' view, sec- ondary to the powerful influence of the "outstanding personage who has made great, historical and meritorious achievements" and for whom cad- res have the most " 'profound affection'."73 Attributing the CCP's victory in 1949 almost solely to Mao Zedong, cadres denigrated the contributions of the Chinese people and their own role in the revolution. And, despite Mao's death, they still believe the only way to "reverse the course of events [is to] follow a great personage closely."74 Cadres also mirrored the attitudes of despotic leaders with their own distorted view of power. In the political rat race for promotions and influ- ence in the CCP, personalistic despotism thrived on the interaction of lead- ers with those cadres who "follow the wind" and "assess the value of a man by the extent of his power."75 Blinded by their own ingrained habits of "boasting and flattery" and believing " 'power means everything'," they failed to challenge even the most heinous crimes of the Gang of Four.76 As long as Jiang Qing held the trappings of power, cadres voluntarily "sold their souls and principles" and "falsely accused their comrades."77 To some extent, this subservience to power reflected the cadres' own subordinate position in the CCP's vast network of political patronage: "In many units and places, those entering the party . .. search for a leader to depend on (gaoshan), while those wanting a promotion do the same."78 But although the Gang had provoked such behavior by "dragging out the 70.

On the con- trary, clientelist relations had preceded the Gang and eased their way to power: "The reason why the Gang could spread their influence across the country like a fish net," People's Daily declared, "was because of their reli- ance on this 'dependency'." And, despite the Gang's demise, "the influ- ence of dependency is still great" so that many cadres "are only in the habit of finding out about the climate and disposition at the top [of the party]."79 Fixated on high-level power politics and in constant search for a " 'strong backer'," cadres were still highly susceptible to a potential des- pot's political manipulations.80 It was also suggested, however, that cadres who "surround" (baowei) the leader were partially responsible for his arbitrary and irrational deci- sions. Quoting Lu Xun's 1920s description of a "surrounder" as one "'who envelops the [bureaucrat] so that even water cannot penetrate'," the press castigated present day "surrounders" for "clinging" to leaders, especially those displaying "bureaucratic airs and a love of flattery."81 Like "a fox borrowing the terror of the tiger," they take "the leader's in- structions to be the 'bestowal of conferred authority by the emperor' in order to intimidate others and enforce orders."82 In this way, "sur- rounders" intensified despotic tendencies in the party and, in some cases, actually manipulated the leader to follow their will: The really sad thing is that some comrades lack the tendency of "surrounding", but as soon as they get a little power ... then they pull in a group of "believers" and raise their own small circle. The result is not that [the leaders] control the small circle, but that the small circle tightly controls them.83 In short, the press affirmed the collective responsibility of rank-and-file party cadres in propping up despotic leaders at the central and local levels. Although the susceptibility of cadres to the powerful leader was a natural response to the political realities of the CCP since at least 1958 and the "irrational structure and defects in our system," China's post-Third Ple- num leadership also believed many cadres, particularly those in rural areas and/or from "petty bourgeois backgrounds," were deeply infected with a 79.

"Resigned . . . to being 'message centers' and 'relay stations'," they not only had failed to resist Mao's personalistic despotism, but had also refused to support the numer- ous proposals, aired since 1956, for reducing the "overconcentration of authority" in the CCP.85 Believing that "'whoever conquers the world is entitled to dominate it'," these 'backward' cadres resisted the structural reforms which could have prevented the Cultural Revolution and the Gang's rise to power.86 The Problem of the 'People' The final factor explaining Mao's despotism was the "slavish" obedience of the Chinese people to personalized, political autocracy. As an indication of the profound depth of despotic authority in Chinese society, post-1978 commentary emphasized that the population's general contentment with "arbitrary but 'orderly' rule" had contributed, at least indirectly, to the party's political degeneration.87 Rather than checking the excesses of arbi- trary leaders, the vast majority of Chinese had provided Mao and local party despots with a compliant, even supportive, audience. With few ex- ceptions the press saw the Chinese people immersed in an intricate web of "feudal" social relations and "customs," especially the "patrilineal" and "patriarchal" family, and tied to such traditional political beliefs as the "mandate of heaven," which inclined them to accept the "great leader" as an organic part of the political order. Like many recent Western analyses of Chinese political culture, the CCP's official press portrayed China's peo- ple as suffering from an excessive political dependency.88 Considerable blame was, of course, directed at the radical Left for this "underdeveloped" popular consciousness. By advocating the "idealist the- ory of innate genius and forcing people to worship their leader as an infal- lible god" and "creating an environment that required the presence of 84.

On the other, Li also suggested the Chinese people had somewhat supported Lin Biao and the Gang's schemes in promoting Mao's absolutism. Responding to his own rhetorical question-"What kind of society ... needs such a political relationship [of absolute loyalty to the leader]?"-Li answered, "a feudal society." The economic system in a feudal society, he argued, "gives rise to a relationship of personal depen- dency. Peasants are dependent on the landlords and residents of the whole country are dependent on the supreme feudal lord-the emperor." Although contemporary China was a "socialist society" where the "rela- tionship of personal dependency . . . has long been broken" the Gang had managed to resurrect "backward and reactionary ideas to an unprece- dented degree" in the Cultural Revolution. Thus, Li concluded, "it is the people who make the great man." This profound cultural and political backwardness of the people was demonstrated by extant "feudal superstitions," especially religion. Wide- spread belief in the sanctifying role of "heaven" and in the material power of such spirits as the kitchen god, maintained the people's identity with the strong anthropomorphic authority of the despot.93 Popular belief in the " 'signs given under divine guidance'" was, Shaanxi Daily noted in No- vember 1980, even "spreading from the rural areas into the towns" where "some enterprise workers and state cadres are also taking part in [tradi- tional festivals]."

"94 These resurrected traditions had even infected the local CCP, for "those carrying the [king's] sedan chair ... were all members of the Communist Party."95 Despite economic progress since 1949, local customs were still deeply embedded in a "pro- despotic" culture among peasants and workers alike.96 Not all press commentary, however, presented a negative image of pop- ular political culture. Although Red Flag criticized the "Leftist mistake" of "exaggerating the consciousness of the masses," some articles in 1979-80 painted a generally positive picture of mass political attitudes.97 In a discussion of party and government elections, for example, People's Daily (September 7, 1979) emphasized the people's innate capacity for choosing good leaders. Citing the example of "Bo Le" (an ancient horse expert adept at selecting "thoroughbreds"), the newspaper asserted the masses were "in the best position to know whether or not a comrade has both the ability and the political integrity to be a capable leader." Although Chinese leaders have frequently emphasized the positive quali- ties of the people while denying them meaningful political participation, some party reformers and "proto-democrats" apparently challenged the dominant image of a prodespotic population to justify fundamental institu- tional reform.98 "Now the political and cultural level of the Chinese peo- ple has been greatly elevated," Liberation Daily argued in defending a new election law.99 Indeed, China's population has allegedly undergone a his- toric transformation of political consciousness, especially since the Cul- tural Revolution.1I?

The Bo Le adage was cited to support such party electoral reform as the proposal to allow several candidates to compete for party posts.

In this sense, the reformers and "proto-democrats" have challenged Marxist orthodoxy by arguing that political events, rather than subterra- nean socioeconomic forces, created a more politically mature population. Reflecting a basically Hegelian interpretation on the origins of political consciousness, they believe the Cultural Revolution constituted a "crisis of authority" out of which emerged a population now willing, contrary to the 1950s and 1960s, to criticize political leaders openly.101 One account, for instance, described the masses' contemptuous reaction to the extravagant "welcoming ceremonies" of party officials while on local tour. Similarly, when some village-level cadres reportedly neglected their political duties to engage in such "feudal" customs as extended mourning for a deceased fa- ther, the "poor and lower-middle peasants" supposedly commented: "'What difference is there between this and the officials of the old soci- ety?' "102 The critical faculties necessary for voluntary participation in politics are now present in the popular mind, at least in embryonic form. On balance, however, the press did not generally promulgate such posi- tive views of the people, even during the "liberal" period from late 1978 through 1979. Rather than praising an emerging political rationality among the masses, most official-and some Democratic Movement-com- mentary stressed the population's cultural and ideological backward- ness. 103 Contrary to the view that a more critically minded and politically prepared people had emerged from the Cultural Revolution, the prevailing interpretation was that the 1960s had strengthened popular belief in "fate" and "superstitious" religion as the ideological foundations of despotism. 104 The "influence of a petty producer . . . and peasant mentality," which leads people to "entrust their fate to the hands of a certain 'savior'," is now cialdom."

"106 Despite the devastation of the Cultural Revolution, "our Chinese nation has lost . . . the ability," one "liberal" intellectual claimed, "to judge the long period of havoc caused by such traitors ... as Lin Biao, Kang Sheng, and the 'gang of four'."107 Repeating Sun Yat-sen's 1910 description of China as a "loose sheet of sand," Deng Xiaoping also evidently believes that the people still lack the basic elements of civil society, specifically the social cohesion, desire for progress, and the informed and critical judg- ment necessary for an active role in political affairs. Until the economic and cultural level of the masses is raised, Red Flag concluded, it "will be difficult to thoroughly eliminate the masses' mentality toward the person- ality cults." 108 Conclusion: Despotism and the Dilemmas of Political Reform China's official explanation of Mao's despotism went beyond a critique of the chairman and radical Leftists to consider the broader political, institu- tional, and social factors that explained one man's personal domination of the Chinese Communist party for almost two decades. In doing so, Deng Xiaoping and the new leadership revealed, perhaps inadvertently, some difficult dilemmas of political reform in an authoritarian political order. If top leaders, rank-and-file cadres, and the Chinese people shared responsi- bility for Mao and the Gang's unwarranted exercise of personal power, then how could the system avoid another similar catastrophe? Indeed, how far should the new leadership go in pursuing institutional reform if, as Deng Xiaoping stated, "Comrade Mao Zedong was seriously influenced by certain bad systems."109 On the other hand, conservative leaders responded with an orthodox Leninist defense of the one-party system in which structural reform should be limited to restoring the CCP's pre-1957 model of "collective leader- ship" later denigrated by Mao and the Gang.

On the other hand, party reformers and "proto-democrats" have fa- vored more basic structural reforms. Emphasizing the pervasive "abuse of power" at all levels of the CCP, they believe reconstruction of an orthodox Leninist structure will not necessarily prevent a return to one-man rule, nor create a more responsible political system. Just as top leaders contrib- uted to such disasters as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution by acquiescing to Mao's absolutism in the later 1950s, so too could a future aspiring despot similarly exploit the overcentralized Com- munist party, especially after Deng Xiaoping's death. Noting the inherent weaknesses of "collective leadership," party reformers and "proto-demo- crats" have thus advocated such radical institutional changes as limited tenure for party officials, the creation of a Montesquieuian separation of powers at the central level of the CCP, and even a "two party system" that go far beyond the Leninist and Eighth Party Congress models.113 110.

SULLIVAN 821 Although the top leadership has so far failed to act on these proposals, and even condemned some party members' advocacy of "extreme democ- racy," recent recruitment of more highly educated and younger cadres into the CCP's higher ranks may produce gradual support for such reforms, especially if Deng Xiaoping's exit produces a conservative reaction similar to Soviet retrenchment under Brezhnev.114 Following their radical depar- ture from the Soviet and Maoist economic models, China's new leaders may indeed introduce dramatic changes in the political system away from Leninist authoritarianism. Yet, as long as even some liberal reformers maintain a negative view of the Chinese people's political capacity, institu- tional reform in China is not likely to go beyond retooling the one-party system, perhaps in the direction of a transition from "hard" to "soft" au- thoritarianism.115 Until CCP leaders accept arguments for a self-regulat- ing civil society with a population willing to challenge, in John Locke's words, "arbitrary or absolute power," the political response to Mao's des- potism will remain limited. 114.
