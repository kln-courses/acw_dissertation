<plain_text><page sequence="1">81 TEXTILES FROM THE BURIAL PLATFORM OF LAS AYISPAS AT CHAN CHAN Ann Pollard Rowe Introduction A collection of textiles excavated from the burial platform of Las Avispas at Chan Chan provides the first sample large enough to permit definition of a late north coast textile style. Befinition of such a style is crucial to the problem of distinguishing local styles on the Peruvian coast, and it is particularly useful to have material from Chan Chan for this purpose, since it was the capital of the Chimu king^ dom (Kingdom of Chimor) which controlled the entire northern half of the Peruvian coast, an area including part of the central coast, in the Late Intermediate Period. Substantial collections of late textiles from the central coast, especially from the Chancay Valley, provide a useful body of material for comparison with the north coast style, since it is the north and central coast styles that are most often confused* The ability to make local distinctions enables us to assign secure attribution to pieces without provenience and to identify the influence of one area on another. The textiles discussed here were recovered in an excavation carried out by Thomas G. Pozorski, then an undergraduate student at Harvard University, in the summer of 1970 as part of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project under the direction of Michael E. Moseley and Carol J. Mackey.1 Las Avispas (fig. 1) is a compound containing a burial plat form, the best preserved of the nine burial platforms at Chan Chan. Within an outer enclosure wall, is the burial platform with an enclosure wall of its own, surrounding not only the platform but associated rooms and open courts. The platform was first built with open space around the back and sides, separating it from its enclosure wall; this original platform contained 14 burial chambers. Most of the space between the platform and the wall around it was subsequently filled in for the con struction of 11 additional chambers. According to Pozorski, the addi tions were made in three stages, first chambers 8,12,15,19? and 23; then 1-4, and finally 24 and 25? These additions need not have been made significantly later than the original construction. Las Avispas is unusual in not being built within or attached to one of the ciudadelas* It is located outside of but near the north east corner of the ciudadela Laberinto (fig. 2). The outer enclosure wall is built of the same kind of flat bricks with the same type of clap board friezes that are found in the structures of Laberinto, but the burial platform itself is built of a different kind of brick which has a height:width ratio of 2:1? According to Alan KolataTs seriation, such bricks occur at the end of the sequence, while the flat type occurs at the beginning.2 The burial platform, therefore, should be a later</page><page sequence="2">82 construction than the outer enclosure wall and should date to the end of the Late Intermediate Period or the Late Horizon. All the textiles described in this report were found in the burial-chamber area of the platform. About one quarter of the volume of the burial chambers was excavated, and only chamber 19 (containing tex tiles numbered 36 in the catalog) was completely excavated. Nearly com plete remains of 13 individuals were found in this chamber, while the entire excavated area yielded evidence of the burial of 93 people. Prob ably many more were originally buried in the platform. According to Pozorski the individuals represented were all females and probably all between 17 and 24 years old. One plausible explanation for this type of selection in burials within monumental architecture is that the skeletons represent sacrificial victims.3 The quality of the textiles, as well as of the other artifacts recovered, suggests that the finest material may have been removed by looters. Abundant potsherds were found, primarily of plates and jars, including burnished blackware. Chamber 19 also yielded fish and crab re mains (possibly food offerings), a quantity of gourd fragments, and 51 beads, some still strung, of seeds (Nectandra sp.). In addition, com plete and fragmentary Spondylus and Conus shells as well as cylindrical shell beads were found in or near the chamber area of the platform. There were also a few miscellaneous objects of copper alloy and some of wood. Although some could not be identified, others either were or could be construed to be textile workers1 implements: a copper needle, some wooden spindles with cotton yarn wound on them. There were also a number of flat notched sticks which might have been used in weaving although no yarn or partially completed weaving was found in association. Both plain and patterned textiles were found as well as some quantity of both white and brown unspun cotton fiber. Unspun cotton fi ber is known to have been used as padding in Peruvian mummy bundles from the central coast, although it is not clear that it was used for that purpose at Avispas A Many of the textiles were found either folded or rolled, as if they had served as independent offerings rather than as garments or mummy wrappings. Many of the fabrics had a hard black resi due adhering to them, resulting from contact with decaying bodies. Al though there were numerous plain-weave cotton textiles, undecorated or with monochrome weft stripes, there was also much decorated material, composing as much as 50% of the total recovered. An exact count is im possible because of the fragmentary condition of most pieces, especially those containing alpaca. Many of the alpaca yarns had been woven as weft or warp stripes, and the opposing set of elements (of cotton) had rotted or bro ken so that only loose alpaca yarns remained without anything to hold them together. Wo detailed analysis was attempted of pieces in this con dition. Analysis was done on a representative sample of plain cotton cloths as well as virtually all of the decorated pieces in which warps and wefts are well enough preserved so that the textile has some coherence, a total of 94 items.</page><page sequence="3">83 The only Chimu textiles with definite north coast provenience previously published are those collected by Max Uhle and analyzed and published by Lila 01Neale.5 Those specimens are now at the Lowie Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley. Uhle found seven textiles at Chan Chan as well as collecting a number on the summit of Cerro Blanco in the Moche Valley.6 Menzel has dated the material collec ted by Uhle at Chan Chan to "the later part of the Inca occupation peri od, "7 and the shrine on Cerro Blanco to the latter part of the Middle Horizon, though the site continued to be used to a minor extent in later times.8 Most of Uhle1s textiles from Cerro Blanco are white cotton plain weave with little, if any, decoration. Although it is impossible to be certain of the date of any individual textile in Uhle1s collection, and it is likely that a fairly long time is represented, the number of technically uniform features found among them suggests a single coherent (Chimu) tradition. 0tNealets analysis of this material reveals an emphasis on cot ton rather than camelid fiber, with single overspun cotton yarns occur ring most commonly. She also points out the use of plain weave with paired warps and loose battening of (single) wefts, monochrome weft faced cotton stripes (in the Cerro Blanco textiles), liberal use of cot ton in tapestry weaving, a brocading technique in which the alpaca supplementary weft is carried almost entirely on the front, and the extensive use of applied fringes*^ Of these features, also found in the textiles from Las Avispas, the analysis of plain weave is especially important in distinguishing north coast from central coast textiles of the late pre-Spanish period. However, most of the other features that she lists, while certainly val id, are insufficiently specific to be of help in attributing particular specimens. The analysis of the Avispas textiles has made it possible to refine these generalizations and has revealed additional technical fea tures which provide further help in defining Chimu style textiles and in distinguishing them from central coast pieces. Such details can provide a more reliable guide than iconography alone, since some designs occur in both areas. Technical criteria are also more widely applicable, since iconography is not always present, even on very fine Chimu tex tiles. Pew details are diagnostic in isolation, or occur on all pieces, so every possible useful feature has been considered. These features are described in detail in the sections that follow, each of which addresses a particular technical subject. In order to highlight these specifically Chimu features fur ther, reference will be made, in the sections titled "Comparisons," to general central coast practices. Bata on the central coast derive primarily from textiles with some provenience information (mostly Chancay) in the Textile Museum collection. Studies of central coast textiles dating to the late Late Intermediate Period and with recorded archaeological associations do not yet exist. The argument of this study requires that data on individual specimens be scattered in different sections. To facilitate the use of the Avispas evidence in future textile studies, a catalog is provided</page><page sequence="4">84 following the text. In the catalog the specimens are listed in order of association. In most cases, full technical data are supplied in the cat alog entries, but where a relatively complicated technical feature is found in a number of pieces, an abbreviated term is used in the catalog which is explained more fully in the text. Page references to the text are supplied in each such case. The text is written so that it can be read independently of the catalog. The numbers used to refer to the textiles in both the text and the catalog are those assigned to them by the excavator, Thomas Pozorski. The number represents an excavation unit within the burial platform, in most cases an individual burial chamber. At the beginning of the list of textiles from each unit the unit is identified. The letters distinguish the textiles found within a single excavation unit. In general, speci mens grouped under a single letter are thought to be fragments of the same original textile. In the excavation catalog each number is prefixed by H75U-7=...; H75 referring to the site of Chan Chan, U to the burial platform of Las Avispas, and -7 to the burial chamber area of the plat form. The full specimen number of the first piece in the catalog is thus H75U-7=3A. Terminology The textile terminology used here is based on Irene Emery's book, T primary structures of fabrics (The Textile Museum, 1966). This work is exemplary in formulating clear descriptive terms for the various textile structures in preference to the jargon words, often with conflicting meanings, that are common in the older textile literature, including that of O'Neale. For example, Emery suggests using "slit tap estry weave" in preference to the term "kelim" borrowed (incorrectly) by O'Neale from oriental rug literature. Similarly, "plain weave with paired warps and wefts" makes much more literal and logical sense than "basket weave,," the term used by O'Neale, since the weave has really no thing to do with baskets. Other O'Neale terms are simply not specific enough. There are many different structures which can be labelled "single-face" or "double-face," "brocade" or "pattern weave, " and it is important to be able to distinguish among them. Emery's classification provides a logical system by which individual structures, even quite complicated and previously unnamed ones, may be clearly described. O'Neale's terminology was based on usage current at the time she worked, and it is no criticism of a great pioneer scholar and teacher in the field of Peruvian textiles to suggest that the publication of Emery's revision of terms for textile structure nineteen years after O'Neale's death has rendered O'Neale's terminology obsolete, along with that of all her contemporaries. In giving dimensions, length refers to the warp direction and width to the weft direction regardless of the actual proportions of a particular fragment. Length is given first unless otherwise specified. In the few examples which are woven of very tightly spun yarns, so the fabric is crimped, the measurement is taken with the yarns relaxed rather than stretched, since they no longer have the strength to sustain</page><page sequence="5">85 stretching without damage. "Alpaca" is here used to refer generally to camelid hair, which is most likely to he alpaca, although no specific analysis was at tempted. Even when the yarns are discolored, it is usually possible to determine what the original colors were, and it is the original rather than the discoloration that is noted. "White" and "tan" cotton repre sent the natural colors of this fiber. There are many gradations of these colors and sometimes the choice of term was arbitrary, a further complication being that staining or bleaching may have altered the exact shade of the original. "Brown" cotton may or may not be dyed. The letters S and refer to the direction of twist in the yarn, the direction indicated by the slant of the midsection of the letter. A "Z" yarn is a Z-spun single, unplied. The notation "Z-2S" refers to a yarn in which two Z-spun singles are plied in the S direc tion. A "Z-2S-2Z" yarn is one in which two Z-2S yarns have been replied in the direction. In other words, the first letter refers to the spin of the smallest component of the yarn, while the second refers to the direction of the plying and the number of components, and the third to replying. Begree of twist is noted only in general terms. In hand-spun yarns, precise measurements are difficult to make and of questionable value. Often, the range of the degree of twist in a single yarn is con siderable. The terms "loose," "medium" (about 45?), "hard" and "over spun" (for creped yarns that tend to twist back on themselves) are sufficient to describe the variations found, and in many cases a range is indicated. In general, only the degree of twist for plying has been noted for plied yarns. In the alpaca yarns, the degree of twist in the component singles is similar to that of the plying, namely loose. In some cotton yarns which are loosely plied, on the other hand, the sin gles are spun hard and this fact has been noted, since it strongly affects the appearance of the finished yarn. In some of these yarns, especially those used for seaming, it is not completely clear whether a paired or plied yarn is employed. In more tightly plied yarns, the degree of twist in the component singles is less noticeable. Yarn diameter is given in tenths of a millimeter. In handspun yarns, diameters are rarely uniform, and this feature is reflected in the ranges of size given. A set of warps or wefts .2-.8 mm. in diameter means that a single yarn will become as narrow as .2 mm. or as thick as 8 mm. With yarns this uneven, usually most of the length will measure approximately in the middle of this range. With relatively tightly twisted yarns or in loosely woven fabrics, the diameter measurement is the same whether a yarn within the woven area or a loose yarn is in or out of the fabric. In such cases, the measurements have been taken on yarns in the woven cloth, as compacted, since when combined with the yarn count the measurement gives a more meaningful indication of the texture of the cloth. All yarn counts have been made by the centimeter. This prac tice is not only consistent with international standards, but is also</page><page sequence="6">86 accomplished 2?5 times faster than counting by the inch and is no less informative, except perhaps in the case of extremely coarse fabrics. If the yarns are paired, it is the number of pairs that is counted (indicat ed by "pairs per cm.") and not the number of singles. Supplementary warps or wefts are not included in the basic counts. The frequency of these yarns relative to the ground warps and wefts is noted separately. In interpreting the yarn counts given, it should be remembered that the weaving is usually uneven and the figures, while valid as an average, may not hold in every part of the textile. Yarns In general it is necessary to discuss yarns in relation to their function in a textile, since different functions require different qualities in the yarns. Thus, a yarn spun for warp often differs from a yarn intended for use as weft, and the warps and wefts in a tapestry woven textile usually differ from warps and wefts in an undecorated cot ton textile. Yarns will therefore be considered within the context of fabric structure in this report, but one important point needs to be raised separately, namely, the differences between the treatment of cot ton and alpaca which cannot be entirely accounted for by the natural differences in the properties of the fibers. Cotton is the predominant fiber, used for all plain textiles and as the base for decorated pieces. This fact is not surprising, since cotton was extensively cultivated on the coast. It is also a logi cal inference that cotton was locally processed. Spindles with cotton yarn wound on them have been found, not only at Las Avispas but also elsewhere within Chan Chan and at many other coastal sites and graves. There is also considerable variety in the yarns produced, not only for different purposes but also for fabrics of the same type. While most of the implied cotton yarns used for the common warp predomi nant, plain-weave textiles in the Avispas material and in Uhle's north coast textiles are tightly S-spun, a significant number are Z-spun and there is a considerable variation in the degree of fineness as well. Yarns used in we ft-faced weaving are quite different, those found as tap estry warps being S-spun and Z-plied, while tapestry wefts are spun and plied in the opposite direction from the warps and with a much looser twist. These spinning practices seem to be restricted to the north coast. Central coast utilitarian (balanced) plain-weave textiles of this period are made of yarns Z-spun and 2-plied S with a medium twist; tapestry warps are similar. In contrast, the alpaca yarns in the Avispas textiles are remarkably uniform, virtually all of them being Z-spun and 2-plied S with a relatively slack twist. These same yarns are used as weft in tapestry weave or as warps in a warp-faced textile. Also, in spite of the fact that alpaca fiber takes dyes very well, a relatively limited color range is found in the Avispas textiles, primarily rose red, golden yellow, and golden brown, with an occasional pink or second shade of yellow. The alpaca yarns found in central coast textiles of the same</page><page sequence="7">87 period are virtually identical. In addition, the yarns used for weft in Huari and Inca tapestry weaving are similar to these coastal yarns, only usually finer and with more color variation. Instead of being found on spindles, alpaca yarns from Las Avispas that were not yet woven were found wound into small bundles, characteristically 7-10 cm. long and about 1 cm. thick. The yarns seem to have been wound first lengthwise, perhaps around the fingers, and then secured by a series of crosswise wrappings. Considering that alpacas thrive only in the highlands, it is reasonable to assume that the fiber was imported to the coast. But the extreme uniformity of the yarns and the lack of spindles with alpaca yarns at Chan Chan and other coastal sites suggests that they were also spun and dyed in the highlands for export purposes, and that this production was on an industrial scale and centrally controlled. Structures Plain weave (warp predominant) Paired warps single weft (3D,3F,3G,3M,3N,30,3P,3Q,3R,3S,3T,3U,3V, 12E,12F,14A, 19A,19B,19C,19I,19J,19K,190, 19P,31A,32A,32E,36c,36D, 36E,36F,36L,36N,46L,54E,54F,54G,55B,55c,55F,68A) The most common type of plain-woven textile in the Avispas lot, of which 41 examples are listed in the catalog, is the one identified by O'Neale as being characteristic of the north coast, with paired warps and single wefts, using single tightly twisted cotton yarns. Such tex tiles may be completely plain, or have warp stripes, stripes with plain weave-derived float weaves, applied feathers, weft-faced stripes (used as borders), or supplementary-weft patterning. In other words, any tex tile of average weight where the decorative structure is compatible with a predominant warp ground is usually woven with this variant of plain weave. Among the 41 catalog entries, there are 52 separate woven fab rics, of which 38 have selvedges so that the identification of the warp direction is certain. Seven other webs have some decoration (warp stripes or supplementary wefts) which gives an indication of the warp direction. Thus, 45 of the 52 webs belong to this category with some certainty. The remaining seven pieces are plain and without selvedges, but are listed here on the probability that the paired elements are warps (3R,3s,3v,12F, one web in 19B,190,55C). On the basis of our additional obser'rations, details may be added to O'Neale's general description. The yarns are usually S-spun although some Z-spun yarns do occur, and two examples are woven entirely of Z-spun yarns (35,12E). Nine examples in the catalog have predomi nantly S-spun yarns but include a few Z-spun warps. Of this group, four have the Z-spun yarns restricted to one-color stripes, but the areas with Z-spun yarns seem to be randomly placed in the others; one (191) also has Z-spun wefts. There are two examples with S-spun warps and Z spun wefts (12F,19P). Three examples have one S-spun warp and one Z spun warp paired regularly; of these, two have S-spun yarns (19A,19J)</page><page sequence="8">88 and one has Z-spun wefts (19B). The degree of twist is uneven. It averages hard, but usually some parts of the yarn are more loosely twisted and other parts are over spun. The wefts tend to be slightly less tightly twisted than the warps, less often having kinks from overspinning. Yarn diameters are typically ?3-?6 mm., and yarn counts relatively low, 6-8 (sometimes up to about 10) pair of warps per cm., with an equivalent number of weft shots. Since the warps are paired and the wefts are not, the warps predominate in the finished fabric. Eight examples have somewhat finer yarns, ?3 ? in diameter or less, and correspondingly higher yarn counts, up to 24 pair of warps and 17 wefts per cm. (19 )? Seven examples of relatively coarse plain weave are white with narrow blue warp stripes in groups of three (3M,N,0,P;19I,j,k). Both 3M and 191 have a loom width of 48 cm. Paired warps and wefts (3K,54C,54I,55A) Pour plain-weave textiles have paired warps and wefts, all with yarns similar to the paired warp with single weft examples but with rela tively high warp counts* One piece has single warps and paired wefts used as ground for allover supplementary wefts (32C). Single warps and wefts (3C,12A,13B,19H,19L,32B,36D,36M,39A,46A,46B, 460-1,460-2,46b,46e,46p,46g,46h,46i,46j,46k,46n,52B,54A,54B,55e) There are 26 examples of warp-predominant plain-weave cotton textiles with single warps and wefts, constituting a significant portion of the sample. The yarns used are similar to the paired warp examples. Twelve examples (46A-46K; fig. 36) were all found in Chamber 6. They have brown and white warp stripes and brown wefts; one (46A) is plaid. The thread counts in these pieces are low, 6-10 warps and 5-6 wefts per cm. Nine specimens (46B-46I) have some stripes that consist of a white and a brown single yarn plied loosely (or S, in 46B), in addition to the solid color stripes of single yarns. Pive (46C,E,F,G,K) have Z-spun rather than S-spun wefts; one (46J) has both. It seems likely that these fabrics were all made for the same purpose. Of the remaining fourteen examples of plain weave with single warps and wefts, four (3C, 19H,19L,55E) with exceptionally fine yarns (.1-.2 mm. diameter) have the plain weave combined with gauze and embroi dery and so will be discussed in a separate section fp. 95)? There are four others with equally fine yarns, of which three (12A,39A,54A) have fringe bands sewn along the edge but are otherwise unornamented except that one (54A) has weft-faced stripes. The fourth of this group (13B) is woven with fine warps but has the fine weft only in areas with supplementary-weft patterning and a heavier weft (.3-?7 nmu) in unpat temed areas. The remaining six examples with single warps and wefts have slightly heavier yarns (up to .6 mm.). Of these, four (32B,36B, 36M, 52B) have supplementary-weft decoration, one (46N) has alpaca weft-faced stripes and one (54B) is a small warp-striped rectangle. All of these</page><page sequence="9">89 last fourteen specimens have a higher warp count than the pieces with paired warps previously discussed, an average of 16-20 warps per cm*, though there may he as few as 10 or as many as 30 warps. The weft count also tends to he higher than in the paired warp examples, averaging - 4 per cm. Comparisons All of these plain-weave textiles, of different fineness, with paired or single elements, S- or Z-spun yarns, and with different de grees and types of decoration, are woven of implied yarns, the sole ex ception being in some of the stripes in fragments from Chamber 6, the yarns of which are plied to achieve a specific decorative effect. On the central coast in the Late Intermediate Period, however, the typical mummy wrappings and utility cloths are woven with plied warps and wefts, usually Z-2S, while only some sheer fabrics are woven of unplied (and unpaired) yarns, usually S-spun. The yarn count of central coast plain weaves is normally balanced rather than warp predominant. Wef-tr-faced stripes (3Q,19B,31 A,46L,46n,54A,54E,55*0 There are eight examples of warp-predominant plain-weave fab rics with weft-faced stripes from Las Avispas. Only one of them (55*1; fig. 42) fits Oj?ale1 s description in having a yarn similar to the reg ular weft, simply used paired instead of single, 10 and that only par tially. Over half of the weft stripes in this piece are woven with paired wefts which are more loosely twisted than the wefts in other areas. The interlacing order (l/l) and number of weft shots per cm. is the same in these stripes as in the rest of the textile. More examples of this technique might have been found if all of the plain fabrics from Las Avispas had been analyzed, since many of the unanalyzed pieces had white cotton weft stripes. More common in the catalogued specimens from Las Avispas, and also found in the Cerro Blanco material,-'' is a type of weft-faced stripe woven on grouped warps. Grouping the warps makes it possible to weave the wefts more compactly, so that in contrast to the preceding type the weft count in these stripes is much higher than in the surround ing areas. There are seven examples listed (30,* 19B, 31A, one web in 46l, 46N,54A, and the remaining weft stripes in 55P) in which three warps or pairs of warps are grouped. In each case, some of the warps are crossed, as in gauze weave, at the transition to the weft-faced area (fig.3)*^ The most common type of crossing, found in five of the seven examples, is one in which the outer wraps in adjacent groups cross (fig. 3)? Two other examples (54A,46l) have two warps in one group crossing two in the adjacent group with the remaining warps in each group uncrossed (figs. 5,6). In 46l, which consists of two different webs sewn together, the weft-faced stripe of the second web is woven on groups of two warps instead of three with a single warp crossing between two adjacent groups (fig- 4)? In four of the seven examples of this type of stripe (3Q*31A, 54A,55F)&gt; the yarns used in the weft-faced stripe are of cotton the same</page><page sequence="10">90 color as the ground. These wefts are unplied but may be more loosely twisted than the other wefts and/or of slightly greater diameter. In 54A and 55F, the wefts are paired (fig. 38b). Weft counts range from 14 per cm. to 28-30. In three examples (19B, fig. 19; 46L,46N), alpaca yarns of various colors are used in the weft-faced stripes. These yarns are spun in the standard manner for alpaca and are used 16-22 per cm. A third method of producing weft-faced stripes is used in 54E, where a lower warp count for the stripe is obtained by interlacing alter nate wefts 3/1 instead of 1/1 (fig. 7). The 3-span weft floats are in vertical alignment, and the intervening wefts continue to interlace 1/1. This procedure results in every fourth warp floating across the entire height of the stripe, on what was presumably the back of the fabric. The opposite face in turn has the appearance of 1/1 interlacing with al ternate warp elements doubled. Since in 54E the warps are paired to start with, the result is that in the weft-faced stripes the interlacing order, counting each single separately, appears to be 4/2. The wefts in these stripes of 54E are also white cotton, in this case paired Z-spun singles. The weft count in the stripes is 9-10 pair per cm. as against 6-7 singles per cm. in the plain areas. Comparisons The use of monochrome cotton weft-faced stripes seems to be peculiar to north coast weaving in contrast to that of the central coast. However, weft-faced stripes woven of alpaca yarns on a cotton ground with grouped warps crossed at the edges of the stripes are sometimes found in central coast textiles, usually flanking an area patterned in some other way. Suwpplementar-weft patterning (3D,13B,19A,19B,32A,32B,32c, 36c,36D, 36E, 36M,52B) Three types of supplementary-weft patterning on a plain-weave ground are found in the textiles from Las Avispas. With a single excep tion (19A) only one appears on any given specimen. By far the most com mon type (ten of twelve specimens) is one involving the insertion, after each ground weft, of a supplementary weft which is employed in long floats on the front with the weft passing under only one warp (or warp pair) between floats. The floats in succeeding shots are in alternating alignment. In general, the designs formed with this technique are broad, so the float length is not dependent on the design. The actual float length varies, ranging from 5- to 7- to 13-span floats, and one example (36D sleeve, fig. 31b) has 17-span floats. Within a single piece, the length of the floats may vary in the weft direction. For example, in the tunic-body fragment of 36D), part of the interlacing order for a sin gle supplementary weft is: 15/1/1 3/1/13/1/11/1/11/1/15/1/1 3/1/13/1/1 3/1/ 11/1. Nevertheless, succeeding alternate supplementary wefts line up exactly. In other words, alternate supplementary wefts all have the in terlacing order given above, with irregularities repeated exactly. This feature suggests that some device may have been added to the loom to use in raising the warps for the supplementary wefts, but that the person setting up the loom did not always count the warps carefully when adding</page><page sequence="11">91 this device.13 The hack view of the specimen illustrates this aspect of the structure more clearly than the front (fig. 25)? The length of the floats and the comparatively large designs give these fabrics a rather crude appearance. This technique is a fast method of patterning large areas and one which is economical of supple mentary yarns.14 It is most often used to produce horizontal stripes. In some cases (32A, fig. 25; 32B;3?B sleeve, fig. 31b;36M) some or all of the stripes contain small motifs woven with discontinuous wefts of contrasting color which are substituted for the color of the stripe for just the length of the motif. Two specimens from Chamber 19 (36C,36D; figs. 31,32) have a large-scale checkerboard design. A more elaborate design, which is incomplete but appears to be the lower half of a human figure, occurs on 36E (fig. 33), while two fragments (32C,52B) are too small for any design to be apparent. Of the eleven examples of this supplementary-we ft structure only one (32C, fig. 27) has only alpaca supplementary wefts, while five are decorated with only cotton yarn and five use both materials. The alpaca yarns are spun as described previously and mostly used paired* The cotton yarns are usually implied and used paired, though in one ex ample (36D sleeve) they are tripled and in another (36E) quadrupled. Two examples (13B,19A) have cotton supplementary wefts which are plied Z-2S (like tapestry wefts, see below), and used either paired or single. These cotton yarns are usually larger in diameter than those used in the ground weave. A single specimen (13^) has a finer weft used under the supplementary yarns than in the rest of the piece. This piece was found in back dirt from the platform rather than in one of the chambers. A different supplementary-weft technique is used in two exam ples (19A,19B). In these cases small bird designs appear isolated on the ground weave and are formed using continuous wefts which simply float across the pattern area on the front and across the intervening ground area on the back (fig. 19)? The bird motif is so small that the length of the floats is determined by the size of the motif in each shot (fig. 18). Since the birds are not close together, the floats on the back between them are quite long. In 19A, a single row of monochrome birds woven in cotton occupies a space demarcated by a pair of supplementary-we ft stripes woven in the first technique described. The birds in 19B are woven in two colors of alpaca yarns and are disposed in several rows in a space flanked by a pair of weft-faced stripes in which the wefts are not supplementary. Among Uhlefs textiles from Chan Chan is a piece which has rows of small birds woven in this same technique.^5 The final example decorated with supplementary wefts (3D, fig* 14) is more complex technically than the others and appears to be part of a stepped corner decoration. The stepped edge (to the right on fig. 14) is outlined by two adjacent bands of color, the outer one red and the inner one brown which changes to black in the lower part of the piece. The inside is red, and the red wefts are floated across the back of the brown band to be used again in the outer red band. The horizon tals in the outline bands are woven with the supplementary wefts in 5 or 7-span floats in alternating alignment. The verticals are woven by</page><page sequence="12">92 taking the supplementary weft hack and forth over and under 8, 10, or 12 warps. The weft interlaces only once before it changes direction. This technique covers the back as well as the front of the fabric. The wefts on the inside of the stepped area interlace mostly 5/l but with the floats in diagonal alignment. The direction of the diagonal may be changed to form a design. Although the example from Las Avispas is too small for the design to be apparent, the general effect can be seen in ^ more complete pieces, including two of Uhle's textiles from Cerro Blanco. Comparisons All of these variants of supplementary-weft patterning seem to be specifically Chimu and may be diagnostic when combined with style and yarn types. Although central coast supplementary-weft patterning has not been described in comparable detail, some general comparisons can be made. For instance, in central coast pieces, background areas for small motifs are not covered with supplementary wefts, and small motifs isolated against the ground weave are generally woven with discontinuous wefts so that there can be horizontal color alternation, in contrast to the Chimu use of continuous wefts for such motifs. Large-scale motifs do not seem to be used on the central coast; instead the pattern usually consists of rows of small motifs isolated against the ground, or an allover design with small motifs set in diagonal bands. In central coast pieces where the design is broader than the length of the floats, the floats appear in alternating alignment, but two succeeding supplementary wefts will have the same interlacing order before the alternation occurs, in contrast to the Chimu practice of changing the interlacing order in each shot .17 Featherwork (3F,19C,19P) There are three examples of featherwork on a plain-weave ground among the Avispas textiles, all in very bad condition, and not very simi lar to one another. Two examples have the feathers sewn to the ground fabric. In 19C (fig# 20) red and yellow feathers with fine quills are placed around the edge of the fabric while in JF black feathers with thicker quills cover the fragment. In both examples, the feathers are prepared for attachment to the fabric by folding the tips of the quills over a cord and tying each folded quill in this position with a second cord using an overhand knot.18 The strings of feathers so prepared are placed with the quill tips and knots facing toward the fabric and are sewn to it with a third yarn (figs. 20b,21 ). '9 This third yarn passes around the second yarn, the fabric under the quill, and the quill itself, ties in an overhand knot with itself and then moves on to the next feather.^0 In 3F a second stitch with an overhand knot is taken with this third yarn just below the first knot before moving on (fig. 21, right). The extra stitch, used for most although not all of the quills, is probably made because the quills of the feathers are larger than those in 19C In ^F, which is a rela tively small fragment, all the work is right to left (fig. 21), while in 19C, which consists of several larger fragments, some sections are done right to left as in fig. 21 (left), and others are done left to right as in fig. 20b. Sometimes, the yarns on which the feathers are initially</page><page sequence="13">93 strung are larger than the yarns used to sew the feathers down, hut for some of the bands in 19C all three yarns are about the same size. The fabric used for the ground in 3F is of average texture, while that of 19c is relatively fine, presumably taking into account that some of it would show. In 19p (fig. 23b), which also has a relatively fine fabric as ground, there are no quills or sewing threads, practically all that re mains of the featherwork in 3^? Instead, the feathers seem to have been cut and trimmed into small pieces, which are simply attached to the fab ric with some kind of adhesive. The few remaining feathers are violet in color. Comparisons The Textile Museum collection includes no central coast feath erwork with provenience information, nor are any examples described in the available literature .21 The paired-warp plain-weave ground is cer tainly one distinctively north coast aspect of the featherwork, however. Some late featherwork with sewn feathers is done on extremely coarse ground fabrics, a feature which might be characteristic of some other area, since Chimu featherwork seems to be done on average to fine fab rics. The technique of gluing cut feathers is probably a specifically Chimu one.^2 Beadwork (19P) The piece with glued feathers also has a beaded fringe (19?, fig. 23b). The beads, no more than 2 mm. in length or diameter, are of a fine-grained, black volcanic rock, probably basaltic. They are cylindrical and the holes are straight drilled. The construction of this beaded fringe is -unrelated to the weft-faced fringe bands to be discussed later. The beads are strung on heavy replied cotton cords. At the end next to the fabric, the cord is divided into its component two plies, each of which is individually se cured successively to each of two holding cords which lie parallel to the edge of the fabric (fig. 23a). Each yarn is looped twice around the holding cord and the end put through the loop in front to secure it. The cut ends of all the beaded cords can be seen above the second hold ing cord. The fabric is in three layers, each of which is folded 2 cm. from the end next to the fringed edge. The holding cords of the fringe are placed between these folds and the folds sewn together, one stitch between each fringe cord. All of the fringe cords of 19P are broken at the lower ends. However, a more complete example of a Chimu beaded fringe suggests the probable method of securing the endsJ^ In this piece, the fringe cord appears to have been put through the hole of the first bead before being replied. After this bead is strung, the cord is doubled and replied and then the rest of the beads are strung. The first bead thus appears perpendicular to the rest.</page><page sequence="14">94 This type of headed fringe is very likely to he distinctively Chinili. Comparable examples do not occur on the central coast* Plain-weave-derived float weaves (3G,3K,3T,36L,3&amp;0 Pive warp-striped fabrics in the Avispas material have float patterning in some of the stripes in a plain-weave-derived float weave. The plain-weave sections of these fabrics resemble the paired-warp plain-woven fabrics previously discussed. Plain-weave-derived float weaves are simple weaves in which the floats are made by omitting some interlacing in plain weave.24 Floats are most frequently 3-span, the result of omitting one interlac ing on a loom set up for plain weave, but may be a higher odd number. The floats are aligned in some rectangular arrangement, as opposed to the diagonal arrangement characteristic of twill weaves. A warp float on one face of the fabric results in a weft float on the opposite face and vice versa. In the Avispas examples, where the warps predominate in count, the warp floats appear to be intended to give the pattern and the weft floats occur on the "wrong" side of the fabric. While these weaves are common among textiles throughout the world, no standard terminology has been developed for them. Many structurai variations are possible, and the most precise method of description is to give the interlacing order. No two of the Avispas examples are identical. In four of them, the patterned stripes have alternate warps of contrasting color. In 3K (fig. 8) only one of these colors floats, in 3-span floats aligned in alternate pairs, while the other color interlaces 1/1 throughout as in plain weave. In 36N (figs. 9,35)&gt; one color interlaces 3/I/VI with the 3-span floats in horizontal alignment, while the second color interlaces l/l on one side of the stripe and 3/I/I/I opposite to the first color on the other side of the stripe. The interlacing order of is more com plex, involving both 3- and 5-span warp floats of both colors and can best be understood by referring to fig. 10. While in 3G, the alternate warps (of the opposite color) do interlace l/l -under the floats, in 36L both colors float side by side in some areas (fig. 11). There are enough irregularities in the weaving, however, so that further generalization about 36L is difficult. The float pattern in 3T is more -unusual (fig. 12). The basic warp striping is an alternation of four pair of brown and four pair of white warps. The floats occur only in the white stripes. At intervals all of the white warps float 5/1? Adjacent floats are slightly offset because of the basic alternating sheds. The wefts float across the whole stripe in 5-span floats on the back. There are three 5-span floats for each warp pair and then a comparable interval of plain weave. Three successive white stripes have these float sections parallel to each other. The float and plain weave sections form a checkerboard in the fabric as a whole. As with featherwork, there are not enough data to indicate that any of these structures is confined to the north coast. Again, it</page><page sequence="15">95 is the paired-warp plain-weave ground that is distinctive. Plain weave with supplementary-warp inserts (55A) One example of this structure is present from Las Avispas (55A, fig. 40)? The fabric appears basically as a warp-striped plain weave, but the warps of one of the two colors of stripes float on the back at intervals to form a solid color design on the front. b In this case, four pair of brown ground warps alternate with four pair of tan supplementary warps, and it is the tan warps which occasionally float on the back. Comparisons This structure has been described in previous works dealing with textiles from other parts of the coast,^5 so it is only the paired warp plain weave of implied yarns that marks 55A as a north coast piece. The central coast examples employ Z-2S yarns used individually. Embroidery, gauze, and supplementary diverted warps (3C,19H,19L,55E) This group of obviously related fragments was found in three separate chambers (13,17,18) in the platform. This distribution could result either from looting or from the production of duplicate garments for burial or as offerings. All of the fabrics are composed of two types of fabrics, a very sheer cotton fabric and an alpaca and cotton warp-faced, warp-striped fabric. The warp-faced band is applied on top of the edge of the sheer fabric in the manner of a border. Some of the fragments have fringe bands abutting the edge (3C, fig. 13;19L) and some do not (55E, fig. 41)? The only example that survives in enough detail to reconstruct the original garment is 19H (fig. 24), which appears to be the sleeve from a tunic (see discussion under Garment Types below). The sheer fabric is sewn into a tube, with a portion of the border on one end and a portion of the main body of the tunic on the other (com pare fig. 43)? The sheer fabric is plain weave with embroidery alter nating with squares of gauze weave in a checkerboard arrangement. The squares are the size of one side (half) of the sleeve. It is possible that the sheer fabrics in the rest of the fragments also had this type of patterning but the fragments are too small to determine the original arrangement of the pattern. The other fragments show the warp-faced band in more detail but the seaming present is not suggestive of any of the known garment types. The sheer base fabric of these specimens represents the finest spinning in the entire lot, both warps and wefts being only ?1-.2 mm. in diameter, hard-spun singles. The twist is sometimes S and sometimes Z. The warp counts are only slightly higher than the weft counts, ranging from 10-20 per cm. The warps as well as the wefts are used singly. The gauze weave is complex alternating gauze, with five shots of plain weave between the shots where the warps are crossed.^ There seem to be no examples of gauze among Uhlefs textiles from Chan Chan and Cerro Blanco, but this exact variant is found in a tunic and hat from the Viru Valley (figs. 43,44) In "the collection of the Textile Museum. In these examples also, gauze occurs in rectangular areas in a checkerboard arrangement.</page><page sequence="16">96 The plain-weave areas of the sheer fabric have embroidered decoration which contrasts markedly with the fineness of the spinning and weaving. The embroidery is done with standard alpaca yarns and white cotton which is spun Z-2S like the alpaca and is up to a millime ter in diameter. These yarns are often used paired, and the size of the stitches is relatively large. The design is simple and not very coher ent. Undulating lines are formed with running stitches that are long on the front of the fabric, passing under only one thread of the ground fab ric at a time. Discs of various sizes, composed of concentric circles in different colors, are made with cross-knit loop stitch.27 Since the stitches are worked in a single line in circles, the manner in which the threads lie is very similar to chain stitch, although the working direc tion is opposite in the two stitches. Chain stitch is not used in any known pre-Spanish Peruvian textile, while cross-knit loop stitch is com mon. That the stitch used here is cross-knit loop stitch and not chain stitch can be determined from the manner in which the work is begun. A small straight stitch is taken in the fabric for the first loop to pass around, a feature unnecessary in chain stitch. Also, in cross-knit loop stitch, it is easy to catch a little of the ground fabric as the needle is passed through the previous loop, a peculiarity that is impossible in chain stitch but occasionally found in the embroidered circles in these fragments. The circles are of varying sizes and are not placed in any observable pattern, but seemingly at random. On the sleeve (19H) where this pattern is best preserved, the circles are placed within the shape outlined by the running stitches. There are also a number of such cir cles that have become detached from their original context because the ground fabric has become so rotted that it serves only to hold the embroidery yarns together. The borders of these fabrics are unusual in having some alpaca yarns used as warps. These borders are more warp-faced than any of the other Avispas textiles, with 16 warps and only 4-6 wefts per cm. The edge of the border that is adjacent to the sheer fabric has five warp stripes, each about 1 cm. wide. Beginning at the edge and proceeding towards the middle, these stripes are lighter and darker brown cotton (of paired, unplied yarns), white cotton (plied like the alpaca yarns), and brown and yellow alpaca (figs. 13,41). On the edge of the border on the inside (next to the yellow alpaca stripe) is a single 5 cm. wide stripe composed of red alpaca warps. This stripe is patterned with brown cotton diverted supplementary warps, made of paired unplied yarns. These supplementary warps are spaced, and are diverted back and forth in a zigzag, adjacent warps converging and diverging to form a diamond grid (figs. 13,41). They are caught down by alternate passages of the weft and there are five or seven warps between the side points of each dia mond. The warps float straight on the back of the fabric where not being used for the design. This portion of the fabric is best preserved on 3C and 55E, where a simple bird design is visible. The weft in these bands is a very fine cotton thread. One further example of the use of supplementary diverted warps occurs in the Avispas lot. Some fragments from Chamber 17 (catalog number 3), in which the wefts were so disintegra ted that it was impossible to measure them or analyze them completely, had yellow alpaca supplementary warps against a ground with red alpaca warps.</page><page sequence="17">97 The fringe hands attached to these fragments are similar to others found at Las Avispas and are included in the general discussion of fringe hands, below. Comparisons It may be possible to define a distinctive north coast variant of gauze weave on the basis of these four specimens. The characteris tics of this variant are that five or more wefts of plain weave are used between the gauze wefts, no design more complicated than a checkerboard is formed, and the yarns are extremely fine. At any rate, the gauze weave variant described here differs in the respects noted from the cen PR trai coast gauze type described by 0,Neale and Clark?^? These authors describe pieces which have relatively complex designs in gauze in a ground of plain weave and have only three plain-weave wefts between the gauze wefts. The use of standard alpaca yarns for warp in a warp-faced tex tile is not necessarily a north coast feature. Narrow bands of alpaca warps woven in complementary-warp weave occur on the central coast.^ The combination of cotton warps spun and paired in the north coast man ner with such alpaca warps, however, is distinctive, although apparently not common. There are no examples among TJhle's Chimu textiles. The technique employing diverted supplementary warps is also unusual, but central coast examples are known.50 The spinning and grouping of the yarns in the ground weave is thus again the most distinctive north coast feature of textiles in this technique. Tapestry (3A,3B,3H,3J,13A,19E,19F,19M,22B,36G,36H,46M,52A) There are some thirteen tapestry-woven fragments or groups of fragments excluding the technically related fringe bands, discussed be low. The exact count is unclear, since poor preservation prevents ceiv tainty about which fragments are part of the same original fabric. The warps are rotted in many cases, and other pieces suffer from general darkening and discoloration. Several examples are so small that the de signs cannot be read. Except for the narrow bands (3B, 36G, 36H; figs. 29, 30), none of the fragments is complete enough for the original function of the fabric to be apparent. Several examples (3H,3?T,19E,19M,52A; fig. 16) have a series of weft stripes, each about 1 cm. wide, below the design area. The warps are cotton, and the count ranges from 6 to 9 per cm. The spin of the warps in the majority of pieces is S-2Z with a medium to hard twist. Two examples (3H,3J) have S-3Z warps and one (19E) has some S-3Z warps in addition to the 2-ply ones. Three examples (3B,36G,52A) have some Z-2S warps in addition to the S-2Z ones. "Ohle1 s Chan Chan tap estries also have S-2Z warps. Both alpaca and cotton are used as weft, with cotton used for white and blue design areas and alpaca for red, yel low, and brown areas. The alpaca yarns are the standard type, and most of the cotton weft yarns are also spun Z-2S, opposite to the warps and more loosely, presumably to match the alpaca yarns. Nevertheless, in many examples the cotton yarns are noticeably coarser than the alpaca</page><page sequence="18">98 ones. Some examples (22B,52A) have the alpaca wefts paired in places hut not consistently; 19M and 22B have some Z-spun implied cotton wefts. There is a wide range in the fineness of the weft insertion in the Avispas tapestry fragments. Bands JB and 36G represent the coarsest quality, with 11-19 cotton wefts and 10-32 alpaca wefts per cm. The warp coverage and rendering of the design in these pieces is also very irregular (fig. 29)? The examples with large-scale designs (13A,22B) are also relatively coarse, with 20-22 cotton wefts and 20-30 alpaca wefts per cm., although the designs (fig. 17) are more carefully woven than in 3B and 36G. The finest examples are 46M (fig. 37), which has 38-5O wefts per cm., with the cotton wefts as fine as the alpaca ones, and 3H and 3J (figs. 15,16) which have no cotton wefts and a count of 44-48 wefts per cm. The weave is slit tapestry. Very long slits seem to he avoid ed in the design of most examples, hut those in 46M are sewn closed. In the Avispas tapestries, a few eccentric wefts may he used to define diag onals in the design hut often similar diagonals are stepped. It is noteworthy that the wefts are not neatly finished off on the hack of the tapestry hut float across the hack from one design area to another of the same color (see fig. 30b). Some weft ends simply hang loose on the back. This feature is also found in Uhle's Chan Chan tapestries. Only one tapestry fragment (22B) has an end selvedge preserved, and it has the warps cut and turned to interlace diagonally with the neighboring warps.^ One of Uhle's Chan Chan textiles (cat. no. 4~70d) is a tapestry-woven piece with cut warps interlaced diagonally on one end and the regular alpaca wefts simply beaten into the warp loops without any apparent heading on the other end. Comparisons Although central coast tapestry weaving also uses slits and features the same type of alpaca wefts on plied cotton warps, there are a number of features in the north coast examples that seem to be distinc tive. The direction of spin in the warps, with in every case at least some of the warps spun S and plied Z, is one such feature. Central coast tapestry is generally woven with Z-2S warps. Also distinctive are the loose wefts on the back of the north coast pieces. In central coast tapestry-woven textiles, both sides of the fabric are generally, al though not invariably, neatly finished. In addition, the longer slits in central coast pieces are often closed by occasional dovetailing rather than the sewing found in north coast pieces. On the other hand, in spite of O'Neale's suggestion, the use of some cotton wefts in tapestry weaving cannot be considered a distinc tively north coast feature because the practice does occur in central coast pieces, although it may be slightly less common. However, there are also central coast pieces woven entirely of cotton.^ It appears, moreover, that selvedges cannot be used to distinguish between north and central coast tapestries. Both plain selvedges and the cut and diagonally interlaced finish are found on some central coast pieces.</page><page sequence="19">99 Painted weft-faced plain weave (28A) Only one example of painted plain weave was found and it can not be taken as characteristic of north coast painted plain weaves (28A, fig. 26). It is a narrow band in weft-faced plain-weave cotton. The yarns used, S-2Z warps and Z-2S wefts, are like those in tapestry-woven pieces, but the weft count, 65-70 per cm., is higher than in any of the tapestries in the sample. The band itself is a typical north coast pro duct (see the secton on Garment Types below) but it is unlikely that such bands are the most common foundation for painted decoration among Chimu textiles. It would be expected that the usual type of paired-warp plain weave would more often serve this purpose, and painted examples of such plain weave do exist.33 The design on band 28A is a row of simple birds painted in brown. Presumably this is a dye (chemically bonded to the fiber), as is usual in Peruvian painted textiles, and not a pigment (superficial layer of color). Comparisons of the details of the various birds in this piece indicate that the design was painted freehand, as in most Peruvian examples of this technique, and not printed (e.g., with a wood block). Fringe bands (3c,3D,12A,14A,19A,19B,19L,22B,32,32D,36A,36D,36J,36N,39A, 46L,54A,55F,68A) There are 30 separate fringe bands included in 19 catalog entries among the Avispas textiles. Three of these (32D,36A,36J) are isolated bands and the rest are sewn as borders onto larger textiles. Since most of the fabrics to which the fringes are attached are fragmen tary, it is difficult to determine how they were used. Some small items on which they occur may be noted, however, namely sleeve ends (19A,36D, 54A) and tie ends (55F) (see also figs. 43,44). The disparity in count between the number of fringe bands and catalog entries results from the fact that several separate fringe bands may be sewn to the same piece, sometimes matching one another and sometimes not, sometimes coinciding with a seam in the main fabric and sometimes not. Apparently there was no preoccupation with having a single continuous fringe band on a given edge, and often several shorter bands were sewn side by side, the four bands in 36N being the most striking example (fig. 35). Even very fine pieces may have a series of different fringe bands (fig. 43). Sometimes the ends of the bands are simply abutted, whether the warps are cut or not; sometimes a few overcasting stitches hold two bands together; but the most distinctive join is for the warp ends of the two bands to be tied together, the top warp of one to the top warp of the other and so on with all of the warps, or most of them if the number of warps is dif ferent in the two bands, as is sometimes the case. In one example, (32c, fig. 27) four contrasting fringe bands are sewn one on top of the other, overlapping. These fringe bands are related to tapestry weave, since they are woven in weft-faced plain weave and often employ discontinuous wefts, either for structural purposes or color patterning or both. The types of yarns used are also similar to those used in the tapestry-woven pieces. The majority have S-2Z cotton warps; seven have S-3Z warps (3D, three of the four fringes in 320,36J,39A,54A); three have Z-25 warps</page><page sequence="20">100 (two of the four fringes in 36n and one of the two in 46l). The alpaca wefts are of the standard type, and the cotton ones are usually also Z 2S. The exceptions to the spin of cotton weft yams are 19B,55F, and one of the colors in one of the hands in 4&amp;L, which have S-2Z wefts, while 19A, the two bands in 320 and one band in 46L have paired implied wefts, either S- or Z-spun. The usual construction of the fringe bands is that of a simple weft-faced narrow band having most of the wefts extended beyond the warp on one side. Usually some wefts turn back close to the warps instead of extending into the fringe, preventing the warps from spreading apart. The discontinuous wefts that secure the warps may occur as often as every other time the weft is woven to the fringe side or less often. In the few examples where none of the wefts is discontinuous (54A,68A) the warps do have a tendency to spread apart toward the bottom of the band. Sometimes two groups of warps are separated by a space (here termed a double fringe, see fig. 28) and again the warps can be held in place with discontinuous wefts (19L,36a, one and a half bands in 36n?, though in some examples they are not (30, one and a half bands in 3&amp;n). In all of these fringe bands the wefts that form the fringe are cut apart at the end. The free ends are not treated in any other way. A number of fringe bands have all alpaca wefts in a single color, either red (30,19L,22B,36n) or yellow (320,32b,36j). These bands have 4-8 warps. Most have a relatively low weft count, 12-20 per cm.; 22B and 36n have slightly higher counts of 24-30 wefts per cm. Some of the red bands are double, and these have a slightly larger number of warps in the upper part of the band than in the lower part. The wefts usually extend only 1.5-2 cm. beyond the warp, though a few examples are wider (36j has an 8 cm. fringe and one of the bands in 36n has a 5 cm. fringe). Four of the fringe bands (3B,12A,I4A,36a) have simple tapestry patterning. A zigzag color change dividing the band into triangles or stepped triangles is the favorite motif (fig. 14)? The part of the band with the patterning is wider than in plain bands, with 10-16 warps. These bands also have a higher weft count than the plain bands, one com parable to regular tapestry pieces. The wefts are either cotton or a combination of cotton and alpaca. One fringe band (19B, fig. 19) is monochrome cotton but has a design formed by discontinuous eccentric wefts. The remaining fringe bands (except 68A) have all cotton wefts. Some of these have simple weft striping (19A,46L; although 68A is also weft striped, it includes alpaca) and some are plain (320,36b,39A,54A, 55*1)? These bands have on the average a lower warp count than those with alpaca wefts, none having more than six and some having as few as two or three (46L,39A). Most of them also have a low weft count, with 12-20 wefts per cm., except for 39A and 54A which are attached to fab rics woven of very fine yarns. Although 36a has very little alpaca, no all-cotton double fringes occur in the Avispas textiles, but such fringes are known (see figs. 43&gt;44)?</page><page sequence="21">101 Two of the narrower fringe bands (39A and one band in 46L) have a method of securing the warps different from the rest. In these bands the weft loops are not cut and adjacent wefts (loops) are twisted together opposite to the ply direction of the yarns, in effect replied. In 46L there are also some discontinuous wefts, though in 39A there are not. Some of the fringe bands in Uhle's Cerro Blanco material are also of this type, having only 2 or 3 warps, secured by replying adjacent wefts and with weft loops uncut. Comparisons Although O'Neale characterizes Chimu textiles as making rela tively extensive use of fringe bands, this feature alone will not serve to distinguish north from central coast textiles. Fringe bands do occur on some central coast pieces (noted also by O'Neale), and some of these bands are very similar to some of the Chimu ones. The central coast fringes are usually not as complex as many north coast ones, however. Double, tapestry patterned and layered fringes do not seem to occur on the central coast, nor does it seem to be common to put a simple fringe band on a plain cotton textile as on 39A and many of the Cerro Blanco textiles. The central coast fringe bands most similar to Chimu bands are simple ones with a single color of alpaca wefts, either red or yel low. However, they usually differ from their northern counterparts in having Z-2S warps and in many examples the weft loops are uncut. Many Chancay fringes are significantly longer than any of the Avispas ones, 12-18 cm. in the weft width.34 Other types of fringes, unrelated to the north coast ones, are also sometimes found in central coast textiles. Tassels (3W,5A,12D,32E,36G,36I,54B,54c,54H,68A) The tassels from Las Avispas consist of a series of tufts ar ranged in tiers on a foundation cord with the lowest tier longer than the rest. Five tassels (3W,5A,12D,361,54H), only one probably complete (54H), were found detached from their original fabric. Of those found attached, one is on the corner of a plain weave fragment which has a fringe band along one edge (68A); one is attached to a narrow piece of plain weave of indeterminate function (32E, incomplete); one specimen is a small rectangle with a tassel attached to each of two corners (54B, fig. 39); and two examples are narrow bands with a tassel attached to each half of the bifurcate ends. One of these (36G, fig. 29) is a long, incomplete tapestry-woven band and the other (54c) a short (27 cm. long) complete warp-striped band. Of the attached tassels only three (on spe cimens 36G,54B,68A) are either complete or complete enough for recon struction. Those attached to rectangles (54B,68A) are relatively short, 5.5 cm. with 5 or 5 tiers, while those on narrow bands are longer: 20 cm. with 7 tiers, complete (36G), and 12 cm. with 5 tiers, incomplete (54c). In the long tassels the lowest tuft is markedly longer than the others. Several of the incomplete tassels are also long: 16.5 cm. with 12 tiers (5A) and 12 cm. with 16 tiers (36I). The tassels in Uhhle's Chan Chan and Cerro Blanco material con firm the uses and proportions suggested by the relatively meager data from Las Avispas. For instance, from Cerro Blanco there is a complete</page><page sequence="22">102 square of plain-weave cotton, 25 x 27 cm., which has a fringe band all the way around it and a tassel at each corner (cat. no. 4-2262). The tassels, with three short tiers and one very long one, are 20 cm. long. A pillow from Cerro Blanco (4-2294), 25?5 x 19 cm., has a tassel at each comer, each 7?5 cm. long with two short and one long tier. There are two weft-faced bands with bifurcate ends among Uhle's Chan Chan pieces, one plain and the other with tapestry patterning. On the plain one (4 70h) the tassels are 33*5 cm. long with 13 or 14 small tiers and one of 21 cm. at the bottom. The tassels on the tape s try-wo ven band are 42 cm. long, with 20 short tiers and one of 18 cm. at the bottom.55 Six of the Avispas tassels are made entirely of cotton, at least three of these with alternating white and brown tiers (5A,12B,54C, possibly 54B and 54H which are now discolored, and 32E which has only one tuft remaining). Three tassels combine cotton and alpaca tiers, in alternating colors (36G,36l,68A)? A single tassel, which has only two tiers remaining, consists entirely of alpaca (3W). The alpaca yarns are standard. The cotton yams in the tufts are mostly Z-2S, but one exam ple (361) has some S-2Z yams and several examples have S or implied yams. Sometimes yams of different spin are combined in the same tassel or even the same tuft (12B,54C). A thick cotton cord is used to unite all the tiers. This foun dation cord also varies in spin from one piece to another, but in six ex amples it is spun S and plied Z. It may be 2-ply (5A,68A), 4-ply (36G, 361,540) or even 8-ply (32E,36g). In 5A, five S-2Z yams are used togeth er. One example uses a Z-2S yam (54B), one uses a replied yam (S-2Z-6S, 54H) and one a series of &amp;-spun yams simply grouped together (12B). The tassel is made starting at the bottom. The middle of the foundation cord is tied in an overhand knot around the middle of a bunch of yams that will become the lowest tier. The two ends of the founda tion cord are then tied together several more times, merely to add length, and then around another bunch of yams for the next tier, and so on. The next step is to bend the yams in each tier double, pointing downwards, and to wrap the top of each tier just below the uppermost knot of the foundation cord. A fine binding yam is wrapped around each tier of the tassel several times. The binding yam is usually an S-spun yam or one similar to that used in the tufts. Each tier is about 2 cm. long by itself, but the tiers overlap in the finished tassel so that the wrapped tops are not usually visible. Comparisons Chimu tassels differ considerably from those of the central coast in both form and use. Central coast ones often consist of a sin gle long tuft the top of which is usually decorated in some way, for ex ample, wrapped for a distance and the wrapping embroidered, or covered with a small tapestry medallion. Even tiered tassels usually have deco rated tops and generally there is some difference in the construction of the tiers from that used on the north coast, although there is no clearly standard method. Tassels are seldom used on the comers of rectangular textiles on the central coast, but rather mainly on the ends of narrow</page><page sequence="23">103 "bands or hanging from the bottoms of bags. Unlike Chimu bands, central coast bands do not have bifurcate ends, so the number of tassels attached, if any, may be one or several.^ Garment Types Loincloth The garment found in the most complete condition was a single large loincloth (55P&gt; fig.42). It consists of two loom widths, 42 and 47 cm. wide and 201 cm. long, sewn together along the side selvedges and with a tie band sewn across one end. The present length of the tie is 219 cm., and it is broken off at both ends, although the extremities of the bands, with fringe bands sewn to the ends were found as separate fragments. The tie band is made of a fabric 21.5 cm. wide which is folded in half parallel to the warp. The sides are not sewn together except in the middle where they are attached to the loincloth. The en tire garment is woven of undyed cotton and the only decoration consists of some weft-faced stripes. These occur at the end of both webs of the loincloth near the tie, in lesser number at the opposite end of one of the webs, and at the end of the tie band. It is not clear exactly how such a large loincloth was worn* Although it has the same general shape as the smaller garments from the central coast that more obviously perform this function, this loincloth and other north coast examples cited below are clearly larger than would be practical to wear in exactly the same way. They may have been draped relatively loosely providing a skirtlike effect. With so much fabric, the draping possibilities are many. Tunics Although no complete or nearly complete tunics were found at Las Avispas, there are several pieces which appear to be sleeves from tunics, from which the existence of tunics can be inferred* Sleeved tu nics are known from the Early Intermediate Period on the north coast.57 There are two sleeves from Las Avispas (19A, fig. 18;36B, fig. 31b) in which complete lengths are preserved. Both are relatively coarsely woven, with supplementary?weft decoration and have a fringe band sewn to one end. Sleeve 3? also has a bit of the body of the tunic attached to the other end, the warp in this section oriented perpendicular to that in the sleeve as one would expect in a tunic. Another fragment (fig. 31a) is probably part of the same tunic since it matches the small sec tion sewn to the sleeve. This fragment seems to be from the neck area of the tunic, although the 16 cm. gap left in the center seam is too small for practical use; it is possible that the garment was meant only as an offering and not to be worn* The two sleeves are similar in pro portion, being made from a nearly square fabric folded in half parallel to the warp, and sewn up the side selvedges* At 20*7 cm* long (exclud ing fringe), 36B is somewhat smaller than 19A (26 cm.). Indeed, 36B is al?iost too small (22 cm. circumference) to be of practical use for any but the smallest person, a feature analogous to the length of the neck</page><page sequence="24">104 slot in the other fragment. The 7.3 cm. fringe of 36D is unusually long, while that of 19A is a more normal 3 cm. Moreover, 19A has end selv edges, as one expects in Peruvian garments, whereas 36D has the ends of the fabric cut and folded under where seamed to the fringe band and to the body of the tunic, evidence of unusually hasty construction. Of much more finely woven fabric is 19H (fig. 24), which also appears to be a sleeve, although its length is incomplete. It is made of a slightly wider fabric (30 cm.) with the sides sewn together as in the coarser sleeves. If the incomplete border of this fragment was ori ginally similar to the complete ones in the technically related frag ments (of unknown garment types) 3C and 55E, as seems likely, the sleeve would have been 9 cm. longer than it is now, i.e., 22 cm., and had the warp stripes of the border running parallel to the weft of the sleeve. Like 36D it has some fabric from the body of the tunic sewn perpendicu lar to the warp direction of the sleeve on the end not covered by the border. All the sleeves have some stripes parallel to the weft at the outside end, and both 19H and 36D have checkerboard patterning. Another tubular specimen, which may possibly be a sleeve is 54A (fig. 38), although in contrast to the others it was made by sewing two loom widths (22 cm. each) into a tube. It does, however, have weft faced stripes and a fringe on one end. The other end is broken and therefore lacks any evident seam, preventing verification of its origin al function. Its present length is similar to the complete length of the others (22.5 cm.). Fig. 43 provides an idea of what a complete Chimu tunic with sleeves of this type is like. This extremely fine tunic, along with a number of other textiles all woven entirely of white cotton, is said to have been found in the Viru Valley. Its close technical similarity to the Avispas textiles makes this provenience information plausible. It is woven of S-spun single yarns, .1 mm. in diameter, with 14-16 warps and 11-16 wefts per cm. The principal decoration is a checkerboard ar rangement of the same type of gauze as in 19H and plain weave with birds (pelicans) brocaded in 5-span floats in alternating alignment with S-2Z yarns. The borders at the ends of the sleeves and along the lower edge of the garment have weft-faced stripes on warps grouped in threes with crossing at the edges flanking a row of small birds very similar to that on the Avispas sleeve 19A. The fringe bands on the sleeve ends and low er edge are also closely similar to Las Avispas ones and are made up of several lengths, with the warps knotted together at some joins. Some of the fringe lengths along the lower edge have two sections of warps and some have three. The warps are S-2Z or S-3Z and the wefts Zt-25. The warps are not secured at the edge of the weaving. The sleeves of the Viru tunic have slightly more squared proportions than the Avispas ones, with a length of 16 cm. (excluding the fringe which is 3 cm. wide) and a loom width of 34 cm., a much more practical size for wearing than 36D). The body of the Viru tunic is made of two loom widths, each 39 cm. wide and about a meter long. These are sewn together along the side selv edges leaving a space of 31 cm. in the center for the neck slit. The resultant width was then doubled over at the shoulders and the side seams and seams and sleeves sewn. The fringe on the lower edge is 8-9 cm. wide.</page><page sequence="25">105 Hats A third garment from Las Avispas seems to he a hat. There are two relatively complete examples with remnants of ties (36C. fig* 32;36F, fig. 34) and another piece that seems related (36E, fig. 33)? They are similar in finished form hut were constructed differently. The most common technique for constructing a hat may he that represented by the checkerboard patterned hat, 36C Construction of this hat started with a nearly square fabric (42 46 cm.) which was folded in half, unspun cotton fibers placed within the fold, and the edges sewn together. The rectangle thus formed was then folded in half again perpendicular to the first fold, and the side edges were sewn to gether, leaving the top and bottom open. The cotton padding gives the hat body and also causes the layers of fabric to stick together better than they otherwise would* Supplementary-weft patterning is found only on the part of the fabric which is on the outside of the hat. The re mains of one tie end are attached to one corner. The tie end is made from a fabric 10 cm. wide folded in half and sewn up the sides. Among the textiles Uhle collected at Chan Chan there is a hat constructed in the same way (cat no. 4?70c), although it is not padded* It is relatively small, 16 24 cm*, and has brocaded patterning on the outside. The tie ends are fragmentary, made of 12 cm. wide fabric fold ed in half, and sewn to the inside of the hat* There is also a padded hat in the Viru Valley lot at the Textile Museun (fig. 44)* made from fabric woven in the same way as the tunic* The Yiru hat is larger than the other examples and taller in proportions, 35*5 x 27 cm., plus tie ends 87 cm. long including 11 cm. of a double fringe band sewn to the ends* The lower 42-44 cm* of each tie end is patterned to match the hat. The Yiru hat is more thickly padded than the others and even the ties are slightly padded. The ties are made from a fabric 12 cm. wide folded in half and sewn up the sides. The ties are sewn on abutting the lower corners of the hat. In contrast, the other Avispas hat, 36E (fig* 34) is made from a long rectangle, 84 x 21 cm* It is folded in half parallel to the weft once and then in half again in the same direction to form a tube* It is unpadded. The remains of both tie ends are present, with a loom width of 7-8 cm. unfolded. The fabric of the tie ends is folded in half but not sewn up the sides. The ends of the ties are sewn inside the hat in stead of dangling from the corner as in 36C. The remaining length of the longest tie end is 25.5 cm. 36E (fig. 33) is a padded tube, longer in its incomplete length of 26 cm. than the other Avispas examples. The width is similar, at 22 cm. It appears to be made of two separate fabrics, on the outside a supplementary-weft patterned fabric and on the inside a more loosely woven plain fabric as lining, with cotton fiber padding in between. The ends of both fabrics are cut and folded under and sewn together at the bottom. Although it is possible that the hat was constructed from scraps, the loom widths of both fabrics are present and match each other. It is perhaps more likely that the weaver was turning out hats hastily,</page><page sequence="26">106 perhaps more than one on a single loom set up, and so did not bother to make end selvedges. No tie ends remain on the piece which would confirm its intended use as a hat. Bands One further garment or accessory remains to be described. A number of weft-faced bands with bifurcate ends and long tiered tassels have been mentioned, among both the Avispas textiles and those Uhle col lected at Chan Chan. The Viru lot also includes such a band (fig. 45) woven entirely of white cotton without any patterning. The woven area is 5.5 cm. wide and 205 cm. long. The bifurcation extends 29-30 cm. from each end. The halves are joined again for 2 cm. at 13.5-15.5 cm. from the ends. The painted band from Las Avispas, -28A (fig. 26), also has this kind of interruption in the bifurcation and is likely to have originally been the same type of band. The tassels on the Viru band are 54 cm. long, with the last tier occupying 34 cm. of this length, the re mainder consisting of 28-32 short tiers. The Viru band is not unique in being unpatterned, since one of Uhle's from Chan Chan and one from Cerro Blanco are also plain (cat. nos. 4-70h,4-2266). Tapestry patterning seems to be equally characteristic of bands, however, as suggested by the Avispas band 36G (fig. 29) and the other one of Uhle's from Chan Chan (4-70g). The tapestry band 36H (fig. 30) may also be an example of this type of band, though the only fragments are from somewhere in the middle. These fragments were found folded in half parallel to the warp with the right side out. There are some undocumented bands with such apparently Chimu features as bifurcate ends and long tiered tassels which are also folded in this manner.38 There is no solid evidence to suggest exactly what these bands were used for. One possibility is that they were used either to wind around the head, a use documented for Inca women, or to bind up the hair. Many Guatemalan Indian women today use weft-faced bands to bind up their hair in various complex ways, although there seems to be no documentation of such a practice in South America. Garment sets It appears that the large loincloth, sleeved tunic, and padded tubular hat with ties might form a complete suit of clothing, with the tunic and hat matching. The Viru lot, which includes many plain fabrics as well as the decorated ones mentioned here, does not include a loin cloth, which is a puzzle, and it does include a large (3 loom widths) supplementary-weft patterned mantle of a type which does not appear to be represented at Las Avispas.59 Nevertheless, some confirmation for the validity of the loincloth-tunic-hat garment set is provided by a set of matching miniature garments found by Uhle at Cerro Blanco which in cludes a loincloth (4-2267), sleeved tunic (4-2268), two padded hats (4 2295,4-2296), and a pillow (4-2294) large enough for a figurine wearing the garments to lie on. All of these pieces have the same type of ap plied band decoration. The applied band is merely open plain weave in a color more reddish than the rest of the garment. The bands are ap plied to the lower edge and sleeve ends of the tunic, to the tie ends of</page><page sequence="27">107 the loincloth and the end of the loincloth opposite the tie, to the ends of the ties on the hats and to the outside edges of the pillow. The only noteworthy difference from the Avispas garments is the position of the major decoration on the loincloth. Another set of Chimu gaiments with north coast provenience in the Textile Museum collection is technically identical to the Avispas material and includes a large loincloth, two three-loom-width mantles, and two sleeved tunics similar in their proportions to the Viru tunic.4 These garments are all tan cotton plain weave (implied yarns, paired warps, and single wefts, or single warps and wefts). Their only decora tion is weft-faced stripes woven on warps grouped in threes and crossed at the edges, together with fringe hands 2.5 cm. wide made with two warps and adjacent wefts replied to secure them. The loincloth in this lot is made from two loom widths 49 and 51 cm. wide and 245 cm. long with a tie hand 36-37 cm. wide and 435 cm. long. The tie hand is folded and sewn to the loincloth in the same way as on the Avispas loincloth. It has three groups of three weft-faced stripes at the end near the tie hand (and on the ends of the tie hands) and one group of three weft faced stripes includes a 2-3 cm. wide stripe flanked on either side by 1 cm. wide stripes. There are fringe bands on the ends of the tie bands and on the lower end of the loincloth. Ordinarily, one would interpret these gaiments as masculine attire. Finding them in a burial with presumably female skeletons thus seems strange, although it is possible that they were meant as separate offerings, as is also suggested by the fact that some at least were found folded. Alternatively, perhaps not all of the victims were female. Women's clothing seems to be harder to recognize in an archaeological context than that of men. The evidence for Inca women1 s costume and Chancay women's costume, which is the best we have, suggests that larger, plainer fabrics were used as well as less complex seaming.41 Even if such fabrics are found complete, they may not be readily identifiable; 36N, for instance, might have been a woman's garment. Resolution of this question must await further evidence. Comparisons Of the garment types described, the padded tubular hat and the weft-faced band with bifurcate ends and long tassels are distinctively Chimu and not easily confused with central coast material. It is less easy to isolate Chimu features in tunics and loincloths since these gar ments are also basic to central coast costume and take many forms depend ing on date, status, etc., for which few data are available. As a generalization, however, it is probably correct to say that sleeves are more characteristic of north coast than of central coast tunics and simi larly that large loincloths are more characteristic of the north coast than of the central coast. However, small loincloths and sleeveless tu nics are also found on the north coast. The Viru lot, for instance, includes a small sleeveless tunic, 35 x 55 cm., coarsely woven and pat terned only with warp stripes ( . .1969?39?13)? This tunic is clearly not as fancy a garment, however, as the white sleeved tunic. The most useful clues to the place of origin of any given garment remain the</page><page sequence="28">108 specific types of yarns and techniques used in its manufacture. Iconography Not a great deal can be said about iconography on the Avispas textiles. The great majority of them do not bear any designs and many are either not at all distinctive (for example, the checkerboard designs in 36C-D) or are so unusual that there is nothing to compare them with (13A,36H). The most common representational motif is birds. Bird designs are ubiquitous on textiles from all parts of the coast at this time. The simplified form with from one to three triangles for the body is es pecially common, and the fact that it occurs in the Avispas textiles (3c, 55E,19E) as well as in friezes in the ciudadela Tschudi at Chan Chan means little. It is possible, however, that the simple but slightly more realistic birds with body, tail, and two legs found on several of the Avispas textiles (19A,19B,28A,32B,36M,46M; figs. 19,26,37) are more distinctive to the north coast. Similar birds are also found in Uhle's textiles from Chan Chan and Cerro Blanco,42 as well as on the borders of the Viru tunic and the tie ends of the Viru hat. The larger birds on the tunic and hat are somewhat more elaborate. Those on the tunic are recognizable as pelicans, while those on the hat have an elaborate tail and a spread wing rising from the back, like those in the friezes in the Tschudi compound at Chan Chan,45 and hold a trophy head in their beak. The designs in 3H,3J, and 36E are the only ones from Las Avis pas which seem to relate to Chimu religious iconography. That on 36E appears to represent the lower part of an anthropomorphic figure (fig. 33), 3H the upper part of a similar figure (fig. 15), and 3J a face with a plume coming out of the top curving in one direction and a body and fish tail, drawn to resemble the plume, curving out of the bottom in the opposite direction (fig. 16). All three figures have stacked triangle appendages, a feature which seems likely to be important iconographical ly. The crescent headdress of the figure in 3H is found in many Chimu representations of important or mythical personages in all media. The design in 3J occurs in many variations on unassociated textiles, for example one of Uhle's from Chan Chan (cat. no. 4-70a). Versions of it are also occasionally found on Chimu objects in other media, sometimes with an animal rather than a human face, sometimes with a more complete figure.44 Summary and Conclusions In summary, the techniques found in the Avispas textiles which appear to be distinctively Chimu as opposed to central coast in style are: warp-predominant plain weave with paired warps and single wefts using unplied tightly twisted cotton yarns; monochrome cotton weft-faced stripes; large-scale designs woven with supplementary wefts with long floats in alternating alignment; supplementary-weft-patterned stripes interrupted at intervals by small motifs woven with a substituted</page><page sequence="29">109 discontinuous weft; supplementary-we ft patterning with the floats in diagonal alignment and the pattern formed by diagonal lines in the ground; glued featherwork and beaded fringes; a type of complex alternat ing gauze weave with five or more shots of plain weave between each row of gauze, woven in very fine cotton implied yarns; in a checkerboard ar rangement; slit tapestry weave with S-2Z or S-3Z cotton warps, long slits sewn, few eccentric wefts, and wefts not finished off on the back; fringe bands with S-2Z or S-3Z warps and cut ends; double, tapestry patterned, and layered fringe bands; multiple-tiered tassels on a knot ted foundation cord and with the last tier longer than the rest. In addition there is the use of fringe bands on plain cotton fabrics; the use of short tassels on the corners of plain fabrics and long ones on the ends of narrow bands; long tiered tassels on a type of long weft faced band with bifurcate ends; a padded tubular hat with ties; sleeved tunics and large loincloths. In design, the appearance of a small bird drawn with body, tail and legs seems to be distinctive, as well as the more obvious crescent headdress and stacked-triangle appendages. These features are also found in Uhlefs textiles from Chan Chan and Cerro Blanco and in two groups of north coast garments in the Textile Museum collection. It should be kept in mind, however, that exceptions can occur, and that therefore a combination of several of these features is a much more secure basis for attribution than any single one. The Avispas textiles and those Dhle found at Chan Chan and Cerro Blanco form an internally consistent group with no obvious trade pieces or foreign influence. Although the majority of the textiles found at Las Avispas may be characterized as coarse rather than fine, the quality is variable. There are some quite fine plain weaves (3R,12A,19P,39A), tapestries (3H, 3J), and pieces with patterns in supplementary weft (3B,19B), and the painted weft-faced band (28A) and one of the featherwork fragments (19C) are also fine. There are also very coarse plain weaves (jM-P), tapestry bands (3B,36g), and pieces with patterns in supplementary weft (36C,36b), as well as several examples of hasty construction involving the cutting of warp ends instead of weaving to the warp loops (36B, 36E, 36N) ? Cer tainly, if the Viru Valley textiles represent the pinnacle of Chimu weav ing, as they seem to, it must be admitted that the Avispas textiles are not the best available. No attempt has been made in this study to confront the ques tion of chronology, since none of the associated textiles can be dated securely. "When more evidence is available on north coast textiles, it may be that the Avispas textiles can be used to give a more precise date for the burial platform. The sample now available from Las Avispas is too small to jus tify serious discussion of possible chronological differences among the burial chambers. In the present sample only four chambers are represent ed by more than ten specimens. These are 13, the central chamber in the original burial platform; 17 and 6, also in the original platform, and 19, one of the outer chambers in the first addition. While the pieces from Chamber 6 are mostly brown and white striped plain weave, and thus</page><page sequence="30">110 not useful for comparisons, those from Chamber 19 are distinctive in some ways. For instance, all the tubular hats, much of the large-scale patterning in supplementary weft, and a disproportionate number of very coarse pieces were there. Nevertheless, the tapestry band fragments (36G) from this chamber are virtually identical to 3B from Chamber 17, and the sleeve (36D) is similar in many respects to 19A from Chamber 13. What this study of the textiles from Las Avispas has made pos sible is the establishment of some criteria for identifying Chimu tex tiles, criteria applicable even to fragments of undecorated material. The comparisons made were with specimens from the central coast, and some characteristics of "late" central coast weaving have also been es tablished in consequence. Although many problems remain, a picture of local differences in coastal weaving is beginning to emerge. We can now see some of the sources of the confusion that has plagued previous attempts to sort out local differences. One of these is the number of features common to both central coast and north coast textiles: the use of the same kind of alpaca yarns, both in makeup and in range of color; the use of slit-tapestry weave as a primary medium for iconography; and the extensive use of simplified bird designs. Another source of confusion is that both Chimu trade pieces and Chimu influence occur on the central coast and even further south. It is now possible to attribute more securely those north coast textiles in museum collections which lack provenience information, as well as to identify Chimu trade pieces and influence on textiles from other parts of the coast. Also, in spite of the fact that chronological placement of these "late" textiles is not very precise, the materials described provide a basis for comparison with earlier examples. July 10, 1979 revised December 29, 1980 CATALOG Specimens are listed in numerical order according to Pozorski's catalog numbers. The corresponding excavation unit is given at the beginning of the list of textiles from each unit. Letters were assigned to individual specimens before the analysis was done, which re sulted in some lack of consistency. In cases where a letter is omitted from the listing, the item originally assigned the missing letter was combined with another entry because the two pieces were found to belong to the same original (3E,3L,36B,36K,55D) or else the item was omitted because it was merely an agglomeration of yarns with no apparent woven structure (3I,12B,12c,19D,19N,22A,54D). In one case (460) fragments of two different textiles were found to be stuck together, and were later designated 460-i and 460-2. The overall dimensions provided for each specimen are given disregarding seams, with the length (warp direction) preceding the width (weft direction). Loom lengths or widths, if present, are noted</page><page sequence="31">111 separately* If the fragment includes a fringe hand, the overall length measurement refers to the warp direction of the weh, no matter how small, to which the fringe hand is attached plus the parallel direction of the fringe hand* The width of the fringe hand itself is given separately* The measurements represent the maximum dimensions ascertainable. A detailed explanation of the yarn analysis is given in the Terminology section beginning on p* 84? With reference to yarn counts, in examples where the total number of warps is close to 1 cm*, as in fringe bands or stripes, the total number is given, followed by the width of the item. Where end selvedges are present, the composition of the wefts in the heading area is noted, usually a multiple of the same yarn used for the wefts in the rest of the piece. Side selvedges are described only when they are distinctive, which they usually are not. This de scription generally consists of a thread count for the outer centimeter of the fabric, indicating that the warps are more closely spaced there than in the rest of the fabric. In plain-weave fabrics with no selv edges and one set of paired elements, it is assumed that the paired set is the warp, an assumption that appears to be justified on the basis of the many pieces which do have selvedges. Similarly, if a striped plain weave fabric lacks selvedges, the stripes are assumed to be in the warp direction^ All of the seams are sewn with simple overcast stitches, about 5 mm. apart. Since this feature is universal in the Avispas textiles, it is not separately noted in each case. The description of weave structure is designed to be brief but clear to anyone who has read the preceding text. Por those less familiar with the material, page references to the text are included. The following abbreviations have been used to describe degree of twist (see p. 85 for explanation): 1 = loose, m = medium, h = hard, os = overspun. Thus, h?os means hard-over spun.

Sheer embroidered fabric with warr&gt;-faced border (fig. 13; ? 88,95 96,99-100,104-108) Six webs sewn together: two warpn-faced, warp-striped borders; two sheer plain-weave fabrics; two fringe bands. Each warp-faced border overlays one of the sheer fabrics. Each sheer fabric is folded under 5 cm. from the end selvedge and the fold sewn to the side selvedge of one of the warp-faced bands. The other side selvedge of the warp-faced band is also sewn to the sheer fabric which originally extended beyond the warp-faced band but is mostly now broken off. The end of each warp faced band is cut, folded under 1*5 cm. and sewn to the side selvedge of its sheer fabric. A fringe band is sewn abutting the folded edge of each sheer fabric (side edge of the warp-faced band). The ends of the two warp-faced bands with their sheer fabrics are juxtaposed but not joined. The fringe bands are joined by having the warps cut and knotted together. Remains of one disc (1 cm. diam.), embroidered in cross-knit loop stitch, occur on the sheer fabric. Four similar discs (5 cm. and 1.5 cm. diam*, and 4?5 x 2.7, 2.5 1?5 cm.; originally 3^) detached from their original ground fabric, were also found in this excavation unit.

Gauze fabric with warp-faced border (pp. 88,95,99-100) Two fragments of same or closely related original fabric each has a warp-faced, warp-striped border overlaying a sheer fabric woven in plain weave and gauze with the selvedge of the sheer fabric sewn to side selv edge of the warp-striped band. A double fringe band is sewn abutting the edges of the other fabrics. In one fragment (14?5 x 15 cm.) the warps of the fringe and striped band turn 90? around the corner of the sheer fabric. Piece is too fragmentary to reconstruct original form of the folds that would be needed at such a corner. The second fragment (1.2 10.5 cm.) has a web of plain weave and one with gauze weave seamed side to side with end selvedges sewn to the warp-faced band. End selv edges of warp-faced and fringe bands meet parallel to the seam of the two sheer fabrics.

Tapestry-woven fragments (pp. 97-98) Four fragments from same original have a design of parallel diagonal stripes with a zigzag line dividing some of them. In three fragments the stripes reverse direction to form a point and in two there is a</page><page sequence="42">122 small cross motif at this point. Two additional fragments with horizon tal stripes may or may not belong with the diagonally striped fragments. Weave is slit tapestry, with some eccentric wefts along diagonal edges, and loose wefts on the back.

Plain-woven fragment with beaded fringe (fig. 23; pp. 87-88,92-93, 109,142) There are three layers throughout, joined at irregular intervals by a thick yarn which pierces some or all of them. At the one finished edge the layers are doubled by folding the fabrics 2 cm. from their ends. One layer has a cut end folded under; the other two layers result from a single fabric that has been folded with this fold in turn folded under at the edge. Two cords that support the fringe (holding cords) were placed between the two pieces of fabric along this edge and the folds then sewn together, one stitch between each string of beads. At one end of the fragment, probably originally a corner, additional fabrics were inserted into the folds at the finished edge again doubling the number of layers (total of 12). These additional pieces have side selvedges (perpendicular to the finished edge of the piece). The beads are cylin drical and straight drilled, of a fine grained, probably basaltic, vol canic rock. They are 1.8-2 mm. in diameter; the holes are .6-.8 mm. in diameter and off-center in some beads. Beads range from .9-1 ?8 mm. long most being from 1-1.4 mm. They are strung on thick replied cords. All these cords are broken at the distal end. At the proximal end, the cord is divided into its component two plies, each ply individually secured successively to each of the two holding cords which lie parallel to the edge of the fabric. Each ply of the beaded cord is wrapped twice around the holding cord and the end put through the loop in front to secure it. After it has been secured around the second holding cord it is cut off. Bits of purple feathers adhere to the outside of one side of the fabric. Bimensions: 8 12.5 (length of fringe is an additional 7?5 cm.). Warp: tan cotton, s(m-h), ?1-?3 mm., 23-24 pair per cm. Weft: tan cotton, z(h), .1-.2 mm., 17 per cm. Seam: tan cotton, S-2Z-2S(m), .5 mm. Yarn tacking layers together: tan cotton, S-2Z-4S(m), ?7 mm.

Warp-striped tubular hat (fig. 34; pp. 87,105) Hat was formed by folding a long warp-striped plain-weave rec tangle in half twice in the same direction. Dimensions of hat are 21 21 cm. so original fabric was 84 x 21 cm. Tie ends, made from a fabric 7-8 cm. wide folded in half (but not sewn up the sides), are sewn inside the hat. One tie end sewn 12 cm. inside is broken at the bottom of the hat but there are two detached fragments of it (originally numbered 36 ), 16?5 and 9 cm. long. Other tie end is sewn 6 cm. inside and projects 9 cm. beyond the bottom of the hat. Warp stripes are 4 pair of warps wide, and in a sequence of white, medium-brown, white, dark-brown, etc. Vary ing widths of warp stripes noticeable in fig. 34 result from use of dif ferent thicknesses of yarns.

Tapestry band fragments (fig. 29: pp. 97-98,101-102,106,109) Two fragments of same band have design of nested squares, yellow in the center, then red, then white, on a yellow ground. Weave is slit tap estry with loose wefts on the back. Weaving and pattern formation very uneven. One fragment is 110 x 6-6.5 (loom width) cm. Other fragment in cludes the end of the warp, with discontinuous wefts dividing the band in half for a distance of 3 cm. and a tiered tassel attached to the end of each half. This fragment is 25.5 cm. by 5.5-6 cm. (loom width), plus 20 cm. length for the complete tassel. The two tassels are similar. Only one is complete, and it consists of six short tiers (2-3 cm. long) plus a longer one (6 cm.) at the bottom. Tiers are alternately white cotton and yellow alpaca, with white cotton at top and bottom. Cotton tiers have looped ends, some with a few transverse elements interlaced. Alpaca tiers have cut ends. Warp ends of the band are wound around the foundation cords of the tassels to secure them.

NOTES I am grateful to Michael E? Moseley, who made it possible for me to study the Avispas textiles and placed the resources of the Chan Chan Moche Yalley Project at my disposal for this purpose. It is also a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance of the excavator, Thomas Pozorski, who not only freely shared with me his data on the excavation, but also carried out the tedious work of washing and laying out the textiles in preparation for study. Unless otherwise noted, data on the excavation presented here are from his excavation report, Pozorski, ms?, and Pozorski, 1979? I would also like to thank the editors, especially Patricia J.

Menzel, 1977, PP* 37*40-41* Although preservation of Moche tex tiles is poor, the small amount of data that exists suggests that the Moche textile tradition is distinguishable from that of Chimu in its technical features. The Moche IY plain-weave textiles from the Santa Yalley described by Bonnan (1973) do not have a preponderance of paired warps. The decorative techniques described by Conklin (1979) are also distinctively Moche rather than Chimu. 9 Oj?ale and Kroeber, 1930, ? 48; 0tNeale here notes a close simi larity between Chimu textiles and those from Chincha. An examination of TJhle^ data on Chincha published by Menzel (1967) reveals that the tex tiles most closely resembling the Chimu style (e.g., 0,Neale and Kroeber, I93O, pis. 38,39,41) are all from graves containing ceramics of the post Chincha assemblage or Spanish glass beads instead of pottery vessels, indicating a date beginning in the Late Horizon and extending into the early Colonial Period. During this time the native Chincha style was abandoned and both ceramics and textiles were strongly influenced by for eign styles, including that of the north coast. The textiles associated with Chincha style ceramics (dating to LIP 8 and the first part of the LH), while woven in plain weave with paired warps and single wefts, do not otherwise show a strong resemblance to Chimu material (Garaventa, 1979)? 10 Oj?ale and Kroeber, 1930, p. 48. 11 O'Neale and Kroeber, 1930, pi. 46a. 12 See also Bellinger, 1951, ? 3? The chief reason for this crossing is not that it gives a neater finished effect, which it undoubtedly does, but for convenience in weaving. In weaving plain weave with oveiv-1 under-1 interlacing, alternate warps pass over the shed rod or through a heddle loop on the loom. Manipulation of either the heddle rod or the shed rod thus opens a space (called a shed) through which a weft may be passed. To change to over-3 under-3 interlacing on the same loom setup, it is desirable to have all three warps in each group controlled by the same shedding device, either the shed rod or the heddle rod, an effect which would not be produced if three consecutive warps were grouped. Crossing some of the warps at the beginning of the stripe groups the warps so that for the rest of the stripe the weaver can proceed with the same shedding devices as before without further individual warp manipula tion. When the stripe is completed, the warps are allowed to recross to their original position and l/l interlacing can resume.</page><page sequence="62">142 In Guatemala today, the same type of supplementary-weft pattern ing is done with the aid of two extra pattern shed sticks inserted be hind the heddle rod and principal shed rod (Sperlich and Sperlich, 1980, pp. 102-104)? ^It is also found in a few of Uhlefs Cerro Blanco textiles and in two of his pieces from Chan Chan ( cat nos. 4~70a,-70c). 150fNeale and Kroeber, 1930, pi. 45c. 16 0*Neale and Kroeber, 1930, 1? 46b, which is a very similar cor ner decoration to fig. 14 here, and a sleeve (cat. no. 4-2277^)? An other type of supplementary-we ft patterning, where the supplementary weft is paired with the ground weft in the background of the design area (O'Neale and Kroeber, 1930, 1? 46c), is not found'in the Avispas sample. 17 E.g., Harcourt, 19^2, pl. 25a-b, a Chancay style piece. 18 Compare Harcourt, 1962, fig. 96Ab; also Mead, 1907, fig* 3? 19 / \ Compare Mead1s diagram (1907, fig* 4) where the quill tip and knot in the second cord face up. 20 As the needle with the third cord enters the fabric, it passes over the second cord as well as over the quill. This procedure does not give the effect illustrated by Mead (1907, fig* 4)? 21 No provenience is given for the examples analyzed by Mead. The piece that Harcourt illustrates (1962, pl. 115A) is a north coast one (provenience given as Trujillo). It is similar to 19C except that blue feathers are used rather than red ones. The paired warp ground fabric is clearly visible in the photograph. The ends of the feathers are cut to make the color change clearer, a feature not visible on the Avispas pieces because of the poor preservation of the feathers. 22 The Textile Museum has an example of a type of necklace or gorget (cat. no. 91*943), decorated with glued feathers, which has metal bangles on it in the shape of heads similar to those of 3 (fig. 15) in the Avis pas lot. This piece also has a ground fabric of paired-warp plain weave, with the edges layered and folded under as in 19P* These similarities suggest that 19P is in fact a fragment of this same type of necklace. A complete example of such a necklace, even more similar to 19P and said to be from Lambayeque, is on permanent exhibition in the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York. It is bib-shaped, with a straight lower edge; its surface is covered with glued feathers, all pur ple except for an orange border, and it has a short beaded fringe of the same type as 19? (see next section). Lothrop (1964, P* 188) illustrates a necklace with Chan Chan pro venience in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. This neck lace, of the same type mentioned in note 22, is entirely beaded, and has this type of beaded fringe.</page><page sequence="63">143 24Siiery, I966, p. 113 ff.; Rowe, 1977, chap. 9* 25Harcourt, 1962, pl. 26b-c; Emery. 1966, figs. 231-232; VanStan, 1967, figs. 10,19,61-62; Rowe, 1977, fig* 29 26 See Emery (1966, fig. 289) for basic complex alternating gauze.

This unusual use of gauze weave may also be distinctive to the north coast. 29E.g., Howe, 1977, fig- 80. 30 The Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York, has an example (cat. no. 5/1628) from the Hacienda Marquez, near Lima. It is woven with the usual central coast yarns (Z-2S). Four examples from the Textile Museum collection woven in this technique have Z-2S yarns, including those illustrated in Emery (1966, fig. 295) and Rowe (1977, fig. 50)? One example in the Textile Museum has S-spun paired warps (cat. no. 91*586). It is woven entirely of cotton and does not resemble the Avispas examples. For a back view of a piece in which the supplemen tary warps are treated much like the ones in the Avispas examples, see Harcourt, 1962, pi. 28c. 31 A diagram of this type of end selvedge may be found in Bird and Skinner, 1974, fig* 4* 32 Some all-cotton central coast tapestries are illustrated in Tsunoyama, 1979, pis. 35,45,48. -^See Moseley and Mackey (1975, PP* 342-345) for an example that seems to be woven with single warps and wefts in a balanced plain weave. There are a number of unassociated examples with paired unplied warps and single wefts in the Textile Museum collection. 34 For some Chancay fringe bands with long fringe and uncut loops, see Tsunoyama, 1979, pis. 28,33,54,58,40,55* 36, ^O'Neale and Kroeber, 1930, pi. 45b. Por examples of Chancay tapestry bands with tassels, see Tsunoyama,</page><page sequence="64">144 1979, pis. 1,63. 57E.g., Benson, 1972, fig. 5-10. ^8E.g., Textile Museum no. 1966?7?71 said to be from Taika, Huarmey Valley. ^The mantle is shown folded in Textile Museum, 19^9, fig* 2 (left). The Yiru tunic is illustrated in color in Lapiner, 1976, no. 622. The Amano collection contains a tunic very similar to the Textile Museum one (Tsunoyama, 1979, 1? 13, provenience given as Chan Chan). The supple mentary weft birds are more like those on the Textile Museum1s Yiru hat than those on the Yiru tunic. ^Accession numbers 1968.26.1-6. Accession records indicate that this group of textiles was found by Ernest Reid, on the north coast, ca. I9OO. No further details are available. The loincloth (l) and the two tunics (5,6) have paired warps. The two mantles (2,3) and another fabric still done up in a tight bundle (4) have single warps and wefts. ^Inca women1 s costume consisted of a large rectangle which was wrapped around the body from neck to ankles, and a large shawl, folded in half and pinned at the chest. Guarnan Poma1s illustrations indicate that while the belt was often patterned, the dress and shawl of non royal women commonly had no patterning other than stripes. The clothes of the female figurine from Cerro del Plomo (Lothrop, I964, ? 218) are striped, the shawl having narrow complementary-warp patterned stripes. Pull size examples of Inca women1 s dress have rarely been identified, the shawl in the Textile Museum collection (Rowe, 1977, figs. 81-82) and the material excavated by Uhle at Pachacamac (Uhle, 1903) being notable exceptions. These items also have broad stripes with relatively narrow complementary-warp patterned stripes, if any. Current knowledge of Chancay women1 s dress derives primarily from cane and yarn figurines. These figurines show presumably male fig ures dressed in short tunics with tapestry borders and loincloths (e.g., Tsunoyama, 1979, pl# 230) and presumably female figures dressed in a one piece long tuniclike garment, with horizontal neck slot and armholes (same source, pis. 231,233)? These dressesare woven in complementary weft diamond twill or a check pattern. Apart from the gauze squares which are presumed to be women1 s headcloths, however, none of the many types of Chancay textiles can be identified as women1 s dress. Presum ably this situation results primarily from a lack of scientific excavation. 42 0fNeale and Kroeber, 1930, pis. 45c (probably a tie end), 47c ^Moseley and Mackey, 1973, ? 340-341? ^Sawyer, 1975, figs. 77,78.

Schwartz, courtesy of The Textile Museum, Washington, B.C. Except for figs. 1 and 2, the drawings are by Eve Becklund based on drawings or yarn constructions by the author. In the drawings of tapestry designs (figs. 15, l6b, 22, 37a) one step is the equivalent of one warp in the textile. The use of eccentric wefts is indicated by diagonal lines. Except for fig. 22, these drawings represent composites of motifs within the piece, no single one being well enough preserved to show all features. The warp direction is vertical unless otherwise noted. Plate XXII Pig. 14? Fringe band warps are horizontal. Plate XXIII Fig. 18.
