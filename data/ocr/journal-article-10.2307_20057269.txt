Because individuals were also thought of as composed of this stuff, it was expected that this luminary could be found within them as well."1 Let's say that there is a light that ascends from below as well as a light from above. Let's believe in this light from below, a mineral light. By talking about my teaching and my own artistic production in the studios where I teach, I would like to bring into the open this mineral light, and in this way say that our enterprise is really a part of the individuation process itself, a journey to the self. At the University of Virginia we teach art in the context of the College of Arts and Sciences. Our students typically are not preprofessionals in the field of art, although some few do go on to graduate art schools. Our students study art in the context of a liberal arts education. It is good that we discuss the liberal arts; we should do so while we still can. Since I started teaching here in 1985 I've always had a significant number of my students arrive from the Architecture School, especially graduate students. There have been so many as to form a distinct and measurable point of view within my studios, a pack or contagion, Deleuze would say.2 This is one of the interdisciplinary components of my studios. What are these architecture students looking for in an etching studio? What are the liberal arts students looking for? What do they find? I teach printmaking. The printmaking studios are a mix of different strata. On the one hand they are like machine shops, rooms with big simple machines, the presses, ponderous machines. In the company of these big greasy machines, and as in any self-respecting machine shop, here you can also find the Gojo Waterless Handcleaner. What would we do without it? These dumb machines really slow us down; to make etchings, woodcuts, or lithographs is to encounter long delays, as *This essay is a revised version of a paper presented at the Commonwealth Center for Literary and Cultural Change seminar "Interdisciplinary Disciplines" at the University of Virginia. New Literary History, 1995, 26: 87-94</page><page sequence="2">88 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Duchamp would put it, as in "The Large Glass." Yet it's a sign of our maturity, isn't it, that we can delay our gratification for so long? The printmaking studios are also ateliers, traditional places to make art, and places to gather to discuss art, discuss novels, films, biology, and all the other components of our studies. With our copper plate in the acid bath for six hours we have all this time on our hands; we gather in the atelier to discuss things. To mention the acid bath is to indicate that these studios are also chemistry labs and are so equipped: primitive chemistry labs. To have art and architecture students setting off little reactions adds a little to the aura of the studios; I think it's part of the attraction. We say in the print studios: experiment with the copper a little, experiment with this process a little. The word experiment comes from the sciences; it's not until this century that we find it used in the arts. It's all a slightly uncomfortable mix: machine shop, atelier, lab. Yet it's a mix with a long tradition. Little has changed in etching studios since A.D. 1600. So a chemistry lab in A.D. 1600? It may be more accurate to speak of alchemy. Alchemy, that is, chemistry that art students (and I) don't understand. Little has changed: a major influence on my work, for instance, is the etchings of Hercules Seghers, a contemporary of Rembrandt; formally speaking, there is little that I do that Seghers hadn't done in 1640. In printmaking we should take this kind of long view. The student making his or her first etching does litde technically that differs from Rembrandt. So it's easy to have a conversation across the centuries; we're still speaking the same language. But what has really changed for us is that we live in an age of mechanical reproduction, an age even beyond mechanical reproduc tion. Technologies are always moving on, advancing; it's hard to believe, but the woodcut, the engraving, the etching, and the lithograph were all once the cutting edge of printing technology, the fastest and most efficient means of reproducing an image. Today they are taught in art departments as archaic and esoteric printing media, completely without purpose or utility, except as an art. All utility has been drained from these printing media. There is nothing left for them but to be an art. We could even say that when a given technology advances and drains a given medium completely that arts will follow naturally in the wake. Isn't this happening today with the traditional form of the book? Soon to produce a book will be without any purpose?except as an art form. So to produce the hand-pulled multiple can no longer have the same meaning today. The traditional notion of a print is to work on the matrix, the stone, woodblock, or copper plate until it is crystalline, perfectly resolved, then to make multiples of it, to reproduce it. To think</page><page sequence="3">MINERAL LIGHT, JOURNEY TO THE SELF 89 this way today, to organize a studio after this fashion, is absurd. In my work and in the organization of the studios where I teach I take a different point of view. Let's view the matrix as a multiplicity rather than a multiple (7P8). It can be an open-ended project, capable of endless permutations, each print a record of a place on this labyrinthine path. The plate is a nomad; let's be urbane nomads.8 Let's make prints that are rhizomes. Deleuze and Guattari devote a chapter in the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia to the rhizome.4 Actually they don't say "chapter," they say "plateau." A fern may be a rhizome, or a vine. Ants, certainly: 'You can never get rid of ants" ( 7P9). With a vine we have a bit of stem, leaf, and root all interchangeable, all capable of generating the others. The rhizome may be broken or ruptured at any point, but this signifies nothing, as every point can be connected to every other. The rhizome is decentered, eclectic, rootless. Kudzu must be a rhizome: it's covering all the South. In fact the kudzu vine shows great potential as a papermaking fiber in our hand papermaking studio. We're going to save the South from this overbearing import. Hand papermaking is another technology which lost its utility early in the nineteenth century: the demand for paper exceeded the ability of papermakers, and a mechani zation of the industry occurred, along with the introduction of wood pulp into the process, which further degraded the entire enterprise. The rhizome is so different from the tree, which has a fixed taproot, its axis, and its genealogy. The tree stands centered and erect; if the taproot is broken, that's it (7P5). Now it is interesting to note that the alchemist saw man altogether as a kind of inverted tree: "for it is to the heavens, whence the soul first came to birth, that the divine part attaches the head or root of us and keeps the whole body upright."5 "Man may be compared to an inverted tree: for he has his roots or his hair in the air."6 Aren't Deleuze and Guattari extending these ideas of root and rhizome well beyond the biological model? Can't we do the same? In the practice of our studio and in our studio production, let's create a rhizomatic movement. Remember: asignifying ruptures. This is fundamentally interdiscipli nary. What matters is not the discipline but the connections. Any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be. A principle of a rhizome is that it is not homogeneous, but that it has widely dissimilar elements or constituents; it is heterogeneous. The constituents are united not on a genealogical axis but on a "plane of consistency" ( TP 69). We make artworks, merely and purely art, so the interdisciplinarity of our activity takes place in the realm of ideas. Within the discipline of art, then, within the printmaking studios, and in my own production, the</page><page sequence="4">90 NEW LITERARY HISTORY various and distinct categories have collapsed. If we look around us we can all easily see that distinctions between drawing, painting, and printmaking are all no longer useful distinctions. Even architecture and sculpture have collapsed, are collapsing into each other. When Robert Irwin works on an airport in Florida, does he work as a sculptor, as an architect, as a landscape architect, or as an ecologist?7 There is a whole pack at work, a contagion. "You can never get rid of ants . . ." (7P9). In this noisy historical moment, at this late date, we need this to occur, and it is occurring: ethics, ecology, politics, and aesthetics become a single field, a new kind of unified field theory, a politics of desire ( TP 155). This can be the beginning of real empathy, empathy in a larger sense. But now I'm really wandering. . .. That is a question, isn't it? "But where have we strayed to?"8 Back in our studio/lab/machine, the sensibility in question is that of collage, what Achille Bonito Oliva calls "the confounded image."9 As an eclectic and rootless structural procedure, a collage aesthetic utilizes association, displacement, and condensation as compositional and the matic strategies. The term "primary process thinking" names the com plex and elegant way of unconscious thought processes that operate on an emotional rather than a rational level. The language of the primary process, as in a dream, is in code (L 31): "Primary process thinking . . . is indifferent to reality and logic and is organized around the vicissitudes of drives; it is oriented toward immediate, direct, and uncontrolled discharge of impulse; it is fluid, undiscriminating, and unreflective; it ignores relations of time, place, identity and causality. In addition, primary process thinking tends to fuse self and not-self; and it teems with condensations, displacements, physiognomic impressions and magi cal notions."10 Is our task to cultivate our thinking in this way? Remem ber that earlier, while talking about the lab-like conditions in the studio, I said that we set off little reactions. The primary process material here is likewise small-scale; we are not patients. Ernest Kris is famous for his phrase "regression in the service of the ego," meaning a partial, temporary, "inspiration" seeking shift to a more primitive level of psychic functioning than that typical of the individual's normal waking state. . . . This creative regression, when it is truly creative and not predominantly a disguise for psychotic trends or for unsocialized daydreams, remains essentially under the control of the ego. It is primarily or largely an active process of taking imaginative liberties and not an altogether passive process of being overwhelmed by alien forces. Its active rather than passive nature is demonstrated by the fact that the creative regression is always accompanied or succeeded by critical evaluation and modification of the primary process material... . "Progression in the service of the ego" or, more correctly, "progression of psychic functioning"</page><page sequence="5">MINERAL LIGHT, JOURNEY TO THE SELF 91 to a level more advanced than the individual's usual level may also be involved in the creative process. . . . We do rise above ourselves at times, too. (80-81) [This] is not restricted to the products of the creative process, it seems to be an aspect of all human thinking and behavior. . . . [Nevertheless] the spread of psychic levels in creative activity seems clearer and perhaps broader than that usually encountered in more routine daytime thought processes and actions. The outstanding place of the Rorschach test. . . among personality tests seems to derive to a great extent from the prominence and resulting instructiveness of creative work [it requires] in the response process. (81) Who among us has worked in the print studios and not at times considered the emerging imagery a kind of Rorschach-like test? Working within the print studios, we have to be open to the powerful processes of our chosen medium, to try not to dominate them with our intentionality, our willpower. The artist as willful creator, one who simply projects images as one projects a slide, is part of the cardboard notion of the arts that we should knock down. Our images owe their existence to more than our willful efforts. To talk about powerful processes welling up in our work means more than a kind of formalism. The form carries the content, embodies it. The form also always implies an ideology. If I must state the ideology at work, then perhaps it is one of openness, receptivity, and even empathy. In regard to architec ture, students talk to me about being empathetic to the site. Now, the word "site" makes me bristle (such a clinical term), but in fact students talk of sites not as ideal but as conditional. The conditional site is of the earth, its quiet voice rises up and calls forth.11 When I work and when I work at teaching, I want this to happen, I want to try to teach content in this way: I try to introduce very old problems into the studios, archaic problems, elemental problems, with a long and rich visual history which we can call forth. Perhaps no one in his field was as visually attuned as Jung, and his work here, in compara tive mythology, and in the relationship between myth and individual psyche, is tremendously useful.12 We may find ourselves in Daedalus's Labyrinth, "a definitive architec ture . . . life's exact double" (L 25). We are armed with Ariadne's thread in one hand and a sword in the other. Well, perhaps not a sword, perhaps an etching needle. In the labyrinth we ask ourselves, where are we? We may be face to face with the Minotaur, "whose nature is double" (L 26). "The Minotaur inwardly understands the instinctiveness of the animal world and the rationality of the human world, according to an inversion whereby instinct resides in the upper part of the body, traditionally the site of intelligence?and the anthropomorphic aspect occupies the lower part of the body, which is allocated to pure biology" (L 27). "The beloved beast is the extremely evident sign of ambiguity,</page><page sequence="6">92 NEW LITERARY HISTORY and is the monstrosity that must be faced and slain so as to later have the nostalgic feeling for that which was once whole and complete, but now fragmented and ruined, object and world" (L 27). "Theseus defeats the duality of the beast, because he too is armed with a dual situation, sword and ball of thread. His undertaking begins with deconstruction and death. One does not begin with memory but arrives at it. The Minotaur destroyed, Ariadne's thread is then carefully, rhythmically, wound in an act signifying the work of art, Theseus's undertaking, which lives in an active process, a weaving that passes through an unwinding phase and then a winding phase" (L 27). "Contemporary art lives under the sign of the labyrinth" (L 32). The rhythmic unfolding and folding of the thread, once a myth acted out by the hero Theseus, for us today becomes an internal act. In the barbaric times in which we find ourselves, to be an individual is heroic enough. The language of art is the game of eternal circulation, for the labyrinth produces pure movement, the self-reflexive movement of the language (L33). In another semester we may find ourselves deep in the Black Forest: we're reading Grimm's folktale "The Spirit in the Bottle."18 Deep in the forest with the woodcutter we hear a little voice from under the roots of the great oak in the center. We've found a little vessel, perhaps a lamp, and now we've released the spirit in the bottle, who is none other than the great Mercurius, "this versatile and shimmering god (204), many sided, changeable and deceitful" (217). Mercurius survives today: in the Disney movie he is called Aladdin. Our body within the earth, Mercurius, quicksilver, the transformative substance, is our own transformation. Mercurius, forerunner of the individual (196), is loosened from the alchemical vessel. With Jung's help we can see the alchemical laboratory (read: etching studio) as a projection of the individuation process itself. Why do studio critiques sometimes take on some of the characteristics of seminars in clinical psychology, with insight accompanied by all the emotions of a religious conversion or revelation, and this despite the fact that none of us are trained in this field? The numinous material in these fields is the same; our collective goal is the development of the integrated personality, the individual. This is the path of artistry in the various fields. Perhaps the artist is an alchemist without knowing it, for "he interrogates the memory of the archetypal world."14 It is not the artist who creates a symbol but the symbol that imposes itself on the artist. It can not be doubted that the symbolic elaboration of a theme is the basis of artistic creation.15 Let's go back to the questions from the beginning. Student artists and student architects arrive in our studios because they want to create</page><page sequence="7">MINERAL LIGHT, JOURNEY TO THE SELF 93 something. With Melanie Klein's help in the study of object relations, we can see convincingly that the wish to create is really the wish to recreate, for we carry within us the memory of a whole object, a whole world. It is this wish to recreate and restore a loved object, once whole but now in parts and ruined, that motivates us to work (197). The artist must be vulnerable and in a state of receptivity to recreate the lost loved object, which is our self, our self in our world, the world of our work. Students arrive in our studios for the same reason as I, we want to be whole and our activities there are part of that process. When we listen to a spirit in a bottle, we're called down and into the earth, prima materia: the material process that luminates our journey, our journey to the self.

But, it will be replied, the Rhine is still a river in the landscape, is it not? Perhaps. But how?
