<plain_text><page sequence="1">Editorial Remains They endeavored to gather up the least pieces, if the rage of persecutors had left any rests or reliquies. Theophilus Gale, The Court of the Gentiles, III, 199, 1677. Museums, those now ubiquitous treasure-houses of memory, can be seen as repositories of remains, both as cult and functional remnants of life past and fragments of lost cultural corpora.1 Very little of what is preserved, stored, and exhibited in museums around the world today belongs to current practices and beliefs, except as it constitutes the object of the mus?ographie enshrinement itself. We go to museums to look anew at the remains of a life no longer ours: some of it buried in traces of our collective memory, some only in the remains of other memories, or of memories definitively lost. But what are "remains?" Literally speaking, remains constitute a "surplus." They were "set aside"?left over?but also were not consumed; they are, therefore, resistant to absorption, on the one hand, and resilient, on the other. Orange peel, cheese rind, or a chicken carcass last longer in their natural forms than the edible flesh of which they were originally a part. They last longer because they were discarded. In Italian, "discarded" (scartato) carries the additional meaning of "unwrapped," which is related to "skinned," and in its strongest, most extreme form, 'flayed" (the flayed carcass of Marsyas, as in the extraordinary painting by Titian in Prague, is also "remains"). But the remains are mostly fur and bone, whereas what is consumed (transformed into energy and destroyed) is found between the skin and the skeleton?what French physical anthropologists call les parties molles. Yet, as a symbol, remains are ambivalent because they encompass what is discarded and left over, but also, in some cases, what one keeps (or doesn't spend), a sort of "capital" to be preserved and treasured. 1. This editorial is the slightly modified text of a talk delivered at the Museum of Contemporary Art of the City of Bordeaux, in March 1993. I wish to thank its Director, Michel Bourel, for his many kindnesses at the time, as well as Remo Guidieri, who organized the colloquium 'G?rer le reste. Creation et museographisation de l'objet esth?tique a la fin du XXe si?cle/' of which it was part. I am also grateful to Marina Berio for a first draft of the text's translation into English; Gini Alhadeff and Cynthia Elmas helped me to revise its present form. There may then be a relation (if covert and implicit) between this discarded entity, which is the unconsumed remains, and what is set aside, discarded-through-treasuring we might say, which is the "art object," particularly in its museographed condition. In other words, we may also see a sacrificial aspect in this connection between remains and the museographed object ("inscribed in the place of Muses")?this thing that we separate (or "make sacred") from objects of our daily private or collective use: the implements, the technological objects, and also the flow of "media objects," including the information bytes now widely exchanged through computers. One way to approach this question is from the point of view of "offerings"?of ambrosia for the gods? because, after all, aren't art collections in our museums also an avatar of these? As a child, I was intrigued by tales of great sacrificial roasts?of which immortals got nothing but the smoke?and by popular tales, such as that of the freeloading Medieval vagrant who made his bread more appetizing by smelling the meat being cooked at an inn (and, when confronted, acquitted himself by producing the sound o? a coin). Smell, sound: impalpable matter, as both message and messenger, stands for a transfer (or translation) of substance (not just of information) from one domain to another. Significant aspects of the question of remains center on this "transubstantiation," this bodily shirting of realms. The question could be formulated as follows: what do remains become when their status changes, and, as offerings, do they adopt the role of soul carriers, or of substitutes for the living body? "Come poor remains of friends, rest on this Rocke . . .," we find in Shakespeare (Julius Ceasar, V, v, 1), but remains, generally, are bound to eternal rest: debris opposite to living totality. One speaks of "mortal remains" in the sense that the soul is no longer there: "Rest of their bones and so?les deliverie," says John Donne (Holy Sonnets, X, 8). Something essential has escaped, shattering the unity, the fullness of being. Nearly fifty thousand years of funerary procedures have tackled this problem in myriad ways that go from utter preservation to extreme dispersion (dissolution). Thte contradiction brings into evidence the fact that remains?be they a corpse or a work in a museum?no matter how carefully preserved, no matter how thoroughly subtracted from "consumption," are</page><page sequence="2">6 RES 27 SPRING 1995 irreparably perishable, and today the "leftover" object only acquires "world-class" status?as I heard a museum guide at Mantua's Palazzo del Te call it?through mass-media exposure. Is it an extension of our fear that the separation of the body from consciousness might be definitive? Can the "soul" of a work be preserved once the object is gone? Its state of decay, its fragmentation and incompleteness, makes of the object/remains into "decadent" things, not only in their funerary and other connotations but also in their being the opposite of classical completeness (perfection). Having grown up in Rome, a statue appears strange and, in a sense, incomplete to me if it does not lack at least an arm, a leg, or even its head. The fragment of a Roman statue is also like the visible remains of a decadence that we have long adopted, in the West, as the only form that can contain everything we do. (In that sense, we are in a civilization that is more than lettered: it is literary?"literature" taken as the privileged and necessary locus of decadence). All the "glories" of the Enlightenment, of science and technology, cannot obscure the fact that for us nothing can really be complete, achieved, therefore truly classical. Something is always left out (unsaid, unshown, unseen), either as absence, foreignness, or as fragment, "remains": again, a sacred-separated thing, lost to us, a double image, and therefore useless. An ?mage from my Mexican past appears before my eyes, of a once remote corner of the mountains of Chiapas that has now become the object of intense media interest. The image is that of the cleanliness of the Indian villages in the 1960s, of the total absence of debris, of remains. What wasn't organic, perishable, and quickly consumed, was too precious as a utensil to be carelessly discarded. Today, in those same villages, glass, tin, and especially plastic implements and containers feed the proliferation of litter. I do not wish to consider what the relation between art and garbage may be (in the present inflation of both), but it may be worthwhile to consider how different the context of "art" was in this earlier world without remains. It was a world in which closed circuits of perishable goods and nondisposable tools could still maintain a precarious condition without growth, or rather, a situation where growth closed in on itself, where instead of aiming to preserve surpluses, one turned them, again and again, into offerings, thus eliminating any chance for real accumulation. This was clearly a world we might call "sacrificial": a world for which the substitution of bodies could still act as a metaphor??"transference," in the literal sense?from an "earthly body" into a "celestial body" or a "body of immortality." In its sacrificial condition, the cult object, forbear of our objet d'art, was witness and nonperishable (or less-perishable) guarantor of these transactions. It is as though the object (and in particular, the so-called aesthetic object), became, in the sacrificial relationship, which is a relationship "through death," that is to say through separation, the receptacle of a "speck of soul," a fragment of spirit captured in form (as by those famous "soul-catchers" of the sub-Arctic shamans). It would do so by the force of resistance and survival that its formal organization confers on it?the very force, in fact, that gave the utensil its original powers. In sacrifice, there are no remains and nothing is wasted. This sacrificial circuit?a universe in which destruction is institutionalized, socialized?is a kind of world (mundus, also in the sense of "clean," unsullied, pruned) whose economy (oikonomia, or domestic law) were inscribed entirely within the extreme terms of great "parsimony" (hunger) and great "waste" (the orgy, potlach, and feast). What is made sacred in the sacrifice, moreover, is precisely the victim? the victim made into an object (and an offering) and the object exalted to the status of victim (and of offering). In the Christian Mass this ambiguity is still present in the object/host, which is also a complex offering because it deals with a primice (bread, primary product of subsistence), in conjunction with wine, which turns subsistence into a feast (the wasting, spilling of blood). The host is a symbol not just because it represents and stands for flesh and blood but because it is bread and the presence of Christ: this symbolic operation?in the literal sense that it brings about a conjunction that is otherwise impossible?in the "sacrifice" of Mass, enacts the nondecomposable, nonanalyzable sacramental mystery of merging presence and absence, immanence and transcendance. It was not until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that priests began to keep the remains of the unconsumed Eucharist in the tabernacle after Mass, thus associating the tabernacle with Christ's tomb. (Conversely, almost two thousand years earlier, Simonides had sung that the tomb of the dead at Termopylae was an "altar," bomos d'o tafos.) Significantly, at that same time the sacrament of individual and secret confession became practically mandatory before the Eucharist (beyond the act of personal and collective contrition that had always been part of the Mass), and the priest increasingly became one who consumed the sacrifice on behalf of the</page><page sequence="3">Pellizzi: Editorial 7 whole community, only administering the Eucharist to those prepared by confession to "receive" it. (The Second Vatican Council has tried to reverse this trend by once again turning all communicands into "sacrificers.") There may also be some significance in the fact that the remains of the Eucharistie sacrifice were hidden away in their "tomb" at the same time that the object-of-confession (the "sin-object") was removed from the openness of collective contrition and buried away in the dark recesses of the confessional. There is another late Medieval conjunction that is perhaps even more remarkable in this context: that of the cult, traffic, and political manipulation of sacred relics, that reached its maximum intensity then. Just before the flowering of the art object (as object-of representation) in the Renaissance, the sacrificial-body object became?as fragment of the body of the saint? a focus of worship which was also a kind of treasuring. Much spiritual and political-cultural history of the period relates to the management of these skeletal "soul catchers." This paroxistic remains-fetishism may have prepared the way for the development of the Renaissance system of representation, in which "realistic" and sensuous "doubles" of the body (this one now taken, in and by itself, as the model for the object, to be seized through sensation, aisthesis, and in perspective?for the aesthetic object), became dominant and provided a visual support for a new conception of the world as spectacle. I evoke these themes of liturgical and representational history because everything that surrounds our museums is imbued with a certain theo-liturgical character, even if we have only just begun to develop a theoretical interest in the theology of art (as opposed to theology in art) and in this aesthetic liturgy of the temple-museum?despite its prominence in the work and thought of many artists and writers of this century, from Marcel Duchamp to Walter Benjamin and Paul Val?ry. In relation to the museum, that is, to the management of artistic remains, one is inclined to adopt a materialistic approach.2 Any object called superstructural, with respect to the production of goods, is in a certain way superfluous, and this surplus is also a kind of remains. Or we might say that the remains are what is left when one has taken away all that is unessential and unnecessary from the hard core of productivity and consumption?the mineral traces at the bottom of the glass from which all the water has evaporated, the nut of the fruit from which another fruit tree can sprout. Yet it is difficult to completely elude the image of digestion (so prominent in the theoretical writings of Salvador Dall): remains are also what is expelled, evacuated, when one has pressed, sucked from a substance all that might be useful: the reject-remains and the copro-remains. In one way or another "remains" indicate a stop and a permanence in the flood of what comes and goes, of what nourishes and what is nourished, something undigested (or indigestible) is attached to the notion of remains. Remains are therefore also something r?sistent to ritual and which ritual resists, in the sense that they tend to escape from the unending flux of codified behaviors through which social relations are structured, and they emerge therefore, in the last analysis, as nonobjectual objects?akin to the "object-cadaver." Remo Guidieri told me the story of a Russian embalmer who had manipulated thousands of cadavers in his lifetime and was the father of an Orthodox theologian, who, when brought before the corpse of Stalin, was paralyzed by terror. The aura of the work of art and that of the body of a hero are not unrelated: they both have to do with power and death. It is impossible to escape the mortuary resonance of the term "remains." "Rest in peace" is what we say to the dead?or rather the consolation one offers to the survivors (because with respect to a dead person we are always temporary sur-vecus)?but we really mean "let us be." We speak of the "mortal remains" of someone, with the implication that what is immortal, living, does not remain. Through millennia, however, we have attached an absolute value to these remains as if they represented an essential guarantee to our ultimate survival and our transcendent immortality. The first "art" we know of?found in thirty-thousand-year old tombs on the Russian steppes?consists of chain-mail armor made of little ornaments strung all over inhumed bodies. It is quite possible, of course, that body painting?if not tattoos?had accompanied or even preceded these first "aesthetic" objects, also probably intended to preserve the body/remains. In this close association between an ornamental second skin and the body, or the corpse (a different sort of body from the living one), the archaic ornament is like a mirror of beauty that attracts and repels the gaze, protecting, like armor, a space-time impenetrable to the forces of change, of corruption, and of death itself. 2. Satapatha Brahmana III, 7, 4, 11; C. Malamoud, "Path of the Knife: Carving Up the Victim in Vedic Sacrifice," in Indian Ritual and its Exegesis, ed. R.F. Gombrich (Delhi, 1988), pp. 3-4.</page><page sequence="4">8 RES 27 SPRING 1995 Charles Malamoud pointed out how the Vedic sacrificer is at once identical to and different from his victim. By offering the victim, he wants to both offer and not offer himself. The victim and the sacrificer are united (niol?nema ) "by an esoteric identification . . . all the same, this identification does not have to be complete, otherwise the sacrificer would die at the same time as his victim." This unity/separation which is once more, and in the strictest sense, a "symbolic operation," is helped by the recitation of mantras that unite the "benedictions" of the two subjects in the sacrificial relationship, but not "their bodies" (so that the sacrificer is not burned with his victim).3 These bene-dictions are literally bene-ficient, and it is words, finally, that unite/disunite sacrificer and victim. It may be useful to remember this relation when thinking of those other blessings of modern art that link/separate the artist and his sacrificed/museographed work, as they do the work itself and the public of its mortal "consumers." Separation of bodies is fundamental in sacrifice. Or maybe we should say: sustained identification/ separation of bodies. As with the mythic animal, the animal double or theromorphic god, there is a relationship between the sacrificer and the victim (real or potential), a relationship reinforced and sanctioned by ritual means, that is, by magic actions. But these same actions simultaneously deny the relationship by acts that sanction the object-status of the victim, and make it possible to manipulate and dispose of it. Insofar as identification goes, the sacrificer makes himself an object, while with regard to separation, he humanizes the object of sacrifice, blessing it with a "soul" of its own. Thus the sacrificial relationship is a symbolic one that deals with both the objectuality of subjects and with the subjectivity of objects. It is a relationship in which presence and absence, life and death, identification and separation of the victim stands between sacrificer and divinity?who are both construed as beneficiaries of their mediation. Into the simple, reciprocal, binary relationship between giver and recipient, the object/victim, the third sacrificial term, introduces the principle of a common benefit: the sacrificial third term is this benefit?it is in fact the incarnation of it. Returning for a moment to the "sacrifice of Mass," one can observe that it is exactly in the Christian Trinity that this traditional ternary grows indistinct?paradoxically?because in the self-sacrifice of the man-god, the separation between the body of the sacrificer and that of the sacrificed is eliminated in favor of total, radically cathartic identification ("voluntary" sacrifice was already known before Christ, but Christ's is both voluntary and involuntary, willed and suffered, in a fully conscious way). In this act, which might be called metasacrificial, the body dies and is resuscitated "to the right," says the liturgy, of the "paternal" Divinity. And the third term? It is the Holy Spirit?the new link between the body and divinity. While before, a body/victim constituted the connection between two other, albeit quite different bodies, now the relation between body and divinity is mediated by another Spirit that is transcendent and immanent at the same time (it is in this perspective, incidentally, that one can view the difficult but essential Christian dogma of the "Resurrection of Bodies"). It seems to me that this transformation of a sacrificial ternary into a Trinity has implications that are somehow relevant to the condition of the object-remains today. The Resurrection, in fact, demotes the remains in favor of a descent/ascent of the Spirit. When it is resuscitated, the whole body disappears but not "forever," and its future reemergence corresponds to that of "art" objects?including ornaments and other paraphernalia?from their long funerary "exile." (For millennia, most "art" has been funerary). It is then, in Classical Antiquity and in its Christian counterpart, that the object-image-of-the-body takes its place, not only as a monument?that is, as sign of memory, and as admonisher?but as an autonomous presence, as a "beautiful thing"?on which the "beautiful bodies" of the living can model themselves, and in which, like Narcissus, they can admire their reflection. Perhaps it is in the passage from sacrifice to self-sacrifice that both the object/body and the object/idol, the fashioned body of the divinity, deanimate themselves. I believe that the images of our classical art rest on this deanimation, on this reduction of the image-body to remains, and to cadavre exquis. 3. It was Otto Rank who, in 1914, based on the research of Negelein, Rohde, Speiser, Wundt, and others, along with Freud, first clarified the psychological aspect of the relation betwen the "murder of the double"?and of one's double?the narcissistic fixation (both "primary" and "secondary"), and the image of the dead?that is, of one's body?as essential to the belief in the survival of one's soul. It is not possible for me to discuss here the ramifications of Rank's insights for modern art, where the archaic double reappears virulently as a new generalized configuration of the narcissistic fixation that seems to affect "culture" as a whole.</page><page sequence="5">Pellizzi: Editorial 9 In hybrid or transitional contexts, where the sacrificial mode comes into conjunction with what I have called the metasacrificial, the conflict between two quite different conceptions of the idol becomes apparent. I encountered an instance of this among the present-day Highland Maya of Southern Mexico in the story of the origins of certain venerated wooden saints. Apparently, these old images were originally found "living" in caves, where they had spontaneously appeared. Brought to Catholic churches, now the focus of most worship, it was said that the images roamed around, especially at night, suddenly appearing in different places, and thus potentially causing harm, because of their inherent powers, to the common people they chanced upon, those bound to live "on the surface of the earth," as the Maya say. This dangerous situation could not be tolerated; something had to be done?a magical act, actually a sacrificial one was needed to "kill" the wandering images, so that from that moment on, they would stay in their assigned place of worship, their powers contained within the sacred precinct of the temple. This ritual killing was accomplished by pouring boiling water over the entities?thus, in a way, burning them. What is interesting about this myth, from the point of view of the relation between cult and/or aesthetic objects and remains, is that it treats the powerful "thing" as the product and the outcome of a killing: not just any kind of killing but one whose effect is to subtract animation from the object without depriving it altogether of its virtues as an object of worship?it is a killing without destruction, a killing to preserve. The idol/saint, here, is not, as in the lines by Racine (Esther, II, 9): Un dieu sans force et sans vertu, Reste d'un tronc par les vents abattu! (A god with neither strength nor virtue, Remains of a trunk felled by the winds!) but, in a sense, a "living/dead." One manages to control the thing?up to a certain point?because one has "killed" it, but its powers can still be tapped, because its soul-spirit is "trapped" within its immobilized body. Its "remains" are not the image of another lost body: they are that very body within which the spirit-soul resides. By dedicating ourselves to its worship and attaching ourselves to it, we stake everything: as the old French saying goes, "S'attaquer aux esprits c'est 'jouer de son reste,'"("To take on the spirits is to 'stake one's last resources.'") The "cor ralled," partially tamed power of the thing, in Indian churches as in museums, is also what W. Benjamin called its "aura," but we have become so insensitive to "spirits," that we fail to see them roaming the empty halls of our museums. I have suggested that there is a convergence, in Western antiquity, between Pagan conceptions and Christian revelations concerning the nature and destiny of bodily remains and their parallel transfigurations in the (deanimated) image-of-beauty and the (immortal) celestial body. In the Trinity, the only bodily element is represented by the resuscitated Son, while in the classical world, the "spirit-soul" is represented by the shadowy ghosts of Hades, that is to say, precisely, by unrepresentable entities. For two thousand five hundred years, we have been dominated by the representation of inert remains, bodies without soul (something analogous may also have taken place in the Buddhist tradition). But it is, of course, more difficult to determine what the ultramodern destiny of this simulacrum might be today. In the long transition from sacrificial and "idolatrous" cults to that of obsolescence?in this postindustrial condition of ours, in which the object is as much infinitely reproducible as instantly pass??one is tempted to say that we have moved from ritual ly operating on the organic body to an adoration of the inorganic that also takes the form of a new cult of remains. It is as if, in our civilization, the progressive severance of matter from form had contributed to the transmutation of the organic offering into an aesthetic object. In the process, art gradually turns into the presentation of the non-beautiful?from the "especially-not-beautiful," (the "shocking"), through the "not-so-beautiful," and all the way to the "not-even-beautiful." The aesthetization of the "non-aesthetic" object, a Duchampian discourse to which we have grown accustomed, should perhaps be turned on its head. Could we not say that in its effects, the artistic transfiguration deaestheticizes the object by the same gesture with which it "resacralizes" it, that is to say, makes "art" out of it? The urinal was already a highly aesthetic, or aestheticized thing?an "elegant form"?before Duchamp made it into an object of artistic "adoration," by "sacrificing" its original function on the altar of art, in the new temple of the avantgarde Muses. The formal euphemism of the urinal (also indicated by Duchamp's title for the "piece": Fountain), is exactly what the artist wishes to both reveal and</page><page sequence="6">10 RES 27 SPRING 1995 deflate by "exposing" the now "useless" implement (quite appropriately, the original Urinal in the 1913 Armory Show, mysteriously vanished at the end of that "historical" exhibition: another offering that "went up in smoke.") There is a parallel process to the development of techne?in its double form of "science" and "art"?a sort of anti-techne which "decomposes" the technological discourse, making "art" out of what had been "science." But the neat symmetry of this model is suspicious, because it implies that there is no rupture, only smooth transition, betweeen the two modes of our consciousness. I prefer the model proposed recently by Christoph Wulf, in a symposium dedicated to exploring the theme of the "neoancient," when he spoke of "aesthetic spirals" that never overlap. In any event, the neoarchaic which seems to inhabit us?and which we seem to inhabit?is not a d?j?-vu: in its data-processing guise, this neoarchaic acts as the generator, the motor even, of the ultramodern. It is curious that an avatar of the archaic can generate whatever it pleases: it was, in fact, a characteristic of the archaic to generate only itself. The closure of the archaic, which has always been recognized as a sort of "resistance to history," is represented, in the neoarchaic, as an aporia of discontinuity: in other words, in the neoarchaic, the memory of the archaic functions not only as an instrument of rupture (of the historical spiral of aesthetics) but also as a source of "remains"?of nondigested, and even indigestible elements?that work like "seeds," and as heralds (aggeloi, Hermes is both messenger and god of all techne) of the new. Archaic remains, with respect to classical ones, are for us, exogenous. But it is clear that today, filtered as they must be by the primitivist sensibility of the entire century, they can only be presented as neoarchaic. How can we describe a situation in which archaic remains?counterparts of a now fragmented nature?are completely cut off from their living roots and float to the surface of our ultramodern sea? Can and must one hope, in the words of Bossuet, that although "/e comble c'est abattu sur les murailles, et les murailles sur le fondament de la construction artistique/' ("the roof has collapsed onto the walls, and the walls onto the foundation of artistic construction") yet Qu'on remue ces mines, [et] on trouvera, dans les restes de ce b?timent renvers?, et les traces des fondations, et l'id?e du premier dessin, et la marque de l'architecte. La Valli?re (Let these ruins be removed, [and] one will find, in the remains of this upended building, the traces of its foundations, and the idea of the first drawing, and the mark of the architect.) I do not think that it is now possible to escape the vocation for dissolution set in motion by the Enlightenment (under cover of the idea of progress); but the objects of decadence are still imbued with a "spirituality" that is both antihistorical and anticorporeal. Gottfried Benn, spoke of it 1936, the year of the Berlin Olympics, when he wrote: The game has perhaps begun . . . and is still far from ending; spirit [Geist] or life, that is an irreconcilable dualism. . . . One thing is not realized in the other, that is just political chit-chat; "life" is not at all a reality, it is just a repetition of absurdities, an eternal relapse into previous phases, presently glorified in the name of history. Down with history! On the other side of history, reality begins. Let us never, never betray it, at least in the long run, and in our hearts!" Letter to Erich Pfeiffer-Belli, 30, IV, 1936 The heart evoked by the German poet is the same organ?physical object, ideal center of the emotions, but also of ultimate understanding?that the Aztecs tore from the living body of their (divine) man/victims to offer it to their anthropomorphic god/victims. Maybe, in a "nonhistorical" spiral of Eternal Return we can find in our artistic mus?ographie remains at least some fragments of this universal heart that was once transplanted in the sacrificial metaphor?; we could then say, with the poet, that the artist?like an Amerindian sacrificer?with his arm buried deep in our chest: Cherche un reste de sang que l'?ge avait glac?. (Seeks a trace of blood frozen by time.) Racine, Andromaque, IV, 5, 1335-1336 F. P.</page></plain_text>
