Boyle with the late Zacharie Le Rouzic and Mlle R.-L. Doize. Fascicule from Prehistoire, Vol. XIII. Paris, 1959. Pp. 148, 40 plates, 93 textfigs., 9 plans During the past 8o years really only few inquirers have added much by reports on their discoveries to the knowledge of the dis- tribution of the later prehistoric scribings on stone. Hence this work by Abbe Breuil and his collaborators is the more welcome as a valuable addition to a numerically poor section of the anthropologi- cal library. Of all ancient sculpturings, the cup mark, pecked or ground, generally shallow and regularly concave, whether accompanied or not by incised complete or penannular rings, channels, etc., is at once the most common and the most recondite. Unless obviously part of an anthropomorphic figure, as M. Breuil himself pointed out in 1934 in his presidential address to the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia (Proceedings, Vol. VII, Part 3, 1932-34, pp. 289-322), it still guards its secret meaning. The origins of these markings seem to lie in late Middle or early Upper Palxolithic antiquity, perhaps as astronomic symbols connected with the period of human gestation. No doubt the tradition of these survived in stamped and cut-out patterns in pieces of proto-historic and even later personal ornament and equipment. The vogue of the cup mark was at its peak with megalithic and allied cultures in our islands, but only regionally and seldom obscured even in complicated assemblages. In Brittany, however, the plain, small cup was often dominated by, or excluded from, many groups of carvings associated manifestly with the sun, fertility, agricultural prosperity and the dead. This is well shown by the compilers of this tremendous census of the sculpturings on the megalithic monuments of departement Morbihan. Carried out, as one likes to think, as an inheritance and memorial of the days when M. Breuil went into regional problems of prehistory with that remark- able and noble Breton figure, the much regretted Zacharie Le Rouzic, this notable contribution embodies every possible type of scribing encountered in the extraordinarily rich district. Were it not that this monograph must be now regarded as the standard compendium of southem Armorican megalithic sculpture, one could be glutted with the enormous amount of material and motives so frequently repeated and bewilderingly jumbled. That these carvings, comprising so many unbelievably confused tangles, could everhave been recorded in situ, deciphered andreproduced from sketches, rubbings and chalkings, as well as photographs, speaks as eloquently for M. Breuil's tirelessness, infinite patience, talent and genius in this field as does his huge bibliography in that of the cave art. The value of this great paper as a guide resides of course in the fact that, besides the familiar and obvious axes, staves, wheatsheaves, ploughs, anthropomorphic figures and so on, the crude cups, ducts and oculate forms fall into place in the Abbe's, the Misses Boyle's and Doize's, and le Rouzic's register. One would, however, have liked to see a scale alongside each set of sculpturings, since their dimensions can seldom be surmised except when the text contains a mention of size. This personal observation of mine is overthrown by my inability to offer higher praise to the joint authors than to express the opinion that no more comprehensive regional survey of cognate carvings on stone has appeared in north-western Europe since i 867. It was then that the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland produced as an appendix to the sixth volume of its Proceedings for i864-65 the richly illustrated work of its vice-president, Sir James Young Simpson, 'On Ancient Sculpturings of Cups and Concentric Rings, etc.' Since, several articles on the finding of such antiquities have appeared; but so far no fully convincing explanation of most has been advanced. Surely with the stimulus of the workjust considered, prehistorians will recognize that the scribings cut between say three and four thousand years ago upon the surfaces of living-rock out- crops, boulders and megaliths belong to a field as full of possibilities for rewarding research as any of comparable age and range, so intensively investigated in recent years.
