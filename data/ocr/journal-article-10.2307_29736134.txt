<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wondering an^Jt^JvorLd and the Universe: Philosophy in the Early Years PHILOMENA DONNELLY The future of any society depends on the capacity ofthat society to pro? duce citizens who think for themselves. This essay investigates possible connections between how philosophy evolved in Western European society and how young children's thinking develops during the early years of pri? mary school. It will consider children as philosophers and the significance of their philosophizing for democracy, citizenship and the teaching/learning process, within and beyond the primary school curriculum in Ireland.1 In so doing I am not equating the natural philosophers with children, nor am I suggesting that they are childlike. Rather, that the world of the natural philosophers was the birthplace of our alphabet, of literacy, of philosophy and of democracy, and therefore that we can learn from that period. There has been in recent years a renewed interest in the work of the natural philosophers, as is shown in Hans-Georg Gadamer's work, and here I will reflect on how their thinking evolved from the myths of their time, with particular emphasis on their thoughts of the beginning, the origin and the creation of the world and the universe. Humans have always, through thinking, attempted to put order on the world and the universe. Myths have been one traditional way of doing this. Myths are stories told in a particular way, and can represent a search for truth, a love of wisdom and a desire to understand. Science, rather than dis? proving many of them, is in fact confirming some scientific bases for them or parts of them, as, for example, for the deluge myths found in African, Assyro-Babylonian, Inca and Oceanic narratives.2 With the increasingly unified order being brought to societies through globalisation, the earth, time itself and space can become depersonalised, and there is a need for a balance between universally imposed order and some DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 51</page><page sequence="2">personal autonomy for groups and individuals within that order. As people, as children, we need to acquire our own understanding of the world, of space, the stars, the moon, the wind, the planets, time, in order to find our own space and place within it. Only then can the given order become meaningful as opposed to being imposed. The environment is our first teacher. It is through our intuitive responses to our environment that we can learn to respond, to learn language and, through language, to think. Here I will reflect on the link between thinking and myths and how a formal body of philosophy grew from this way of thinking in a particular social context. Some parameters need to be set. My focus primarily is on early child? hood education. Internationally, early childhood is defined as birth to eight years of age.3 The term 'early years' is important for another reason. There has been in recent years a greater awareness within the Irish education sys? tem of the significance of early childhood education for child development. The White Paper Ready to Learn (1999) has demonstrated the Irish govern? ment's awareness of the issue, and a Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education has been established. The term 'early years' itself replaces 'pre-school' as the common description. Rather than our three- to four-year-olds preparing for school, time spent before school is now viewed as important in its own right and in its own time, with the preparation for primary school as secondary. Equally, seeing the years before formal schooling and the initial years of formal schooling as a continuum is a positive step. It is easy to view what is not fully understood as being a stage preceding something more important, one we usually consider more important to us now or to dominant forces in a society. However, it can also signify a failure to recognize the autonomy of'the other'. This also applies to the term 'Presocratic'. Philosophers from Tha?es up to the time of Socrates are universally referred to as the Presocratic philoso? phers. This term has evolved because they are seen as primarily significant as the precursors of the great masters that followed them, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. This loose grouping of natural philosophers comprises thinkers who are important in their own right and have a lasting relevance. The term 'natural philosophers' comes from their interest in cosmology, meteorology, biology and matter theory. Only fragments of their work survive, but enough remains to give us an understanding of the content and thought processes of these men.4 The social context The alphabet was introduced into Greece around 700 BCE. Over the next several hundred years this area of the earth was to witness the birth of 52 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004)</page><page sequence="3">Western philosophy and the birth of political democracy It would seem reasonable to assume that these three factors, literacy, philosophizing and the establishment of a democracy, interconnect with and are interrelated to each other. Along the coast of Asia Minor on the Aegean Sea and all the way to Athens, city-states were thriving by the sixth century BCE. Given their cen? tral geographical position, there was much trading and interacting with Egypt and other countries. Although seafaring was essential to their way of life, they were not nomads and the nobles accumulated much wealth. Isono my, that is, the equality before the law of the citizens of the state, which allowed broad sections of the citizens to win an effective political voice, was realized in Athens through the reforms of Cleisthenes before the end of the sixth century BCE. It was a participatory democracy with a council of 500, a rotating membership and restrictions on re-election, whose assembly could have over 6,000 in attendance.Votes were rarely counted but estimated in an approximate way, but the whole process often involved the abstract analysis of concrete situations. The small independent city-states on the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea had no political ties to Athens, although they had contact with it. The citizens enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle and the lack of uniformity in the overall political world left power widely diffused. Although many men did succeed in gaining a voice in the affairs of state, many, like women and slaves, were excluded. Tha?es, one of the natural philosophers, advocated the uniting of city-states to make larger units.5 There are a number of factors related to this emerging democracy The fact that it was a participatory democracy is significant, in that it suggests a deep-rooted belief in justice. There was a right to appeal magistrates' unjust decisions and many citizens conducted their own litigation. Another ele? ment of this society was the concept of autonomy. Politics was the expression of the freedom to participate in ordering one's own life. These are the elements of Greek democracy that were evolving with the birth of Western philosophy. Goody suggests that widespread literacy actually caused democracy6 To view literacy as the sole factor that existed in the Aegean region is to exag? gerate. The written word was viewed with some suspicion by many. Even Plato was to write in the Phaedrus that writing is but a reminder, it cannot defend itself.'The wise man does not rely on writing.' For Plato, writing was merely a cure for forgetting. The philosophers who are relevant to this work were very much in the oral tradition of their time. Some did write both in prose and in poetic form, and from the fragments of their writing we have their thoughts and arguments. A central topic of their work was the search to understand how the universe and how life began. Thinking and speaking never happen in a vacuum: as well as a social context there is a knowledge DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 53</page><page sequence="4">context, and the knowledge context of the time had a certain basis in myth and story. Myths Myths contribute a way of thinking that expresses the desire to understand. It is in myth and story that a people find identity We interpret the world from a mythic framework. Patrick Harpur explains: Myths are imaginative templates which, when laid over the world, make sense of it. We cannot think without them, because they provide the structures that determine the way we think in the first instance.7 If we accept Harpur's claim that we cannot think without myths, then we must face up to the significance of myths for educationalists encouraging children to think. All societies have their myths. Myths put an order on the world. This order gives us a framework, and this framework allows us to par? take in conceptual thinking. L?vi-Strauss claims 'it is absolutely impossible to conceive of meaning without order'.8 This desire for order in the human mind he relates to the connection between the human mind and the uni? verse, which he sees as an ordered universe, not chaos. While particular societies have evolved particular myths, many of them have similar themes, and the concept of a beginning is omnipresent. To understand the present and our place in the universe, we have a need to understand what preceded us and how it all began. It is part of our search for identity and where our origins lie. In a more acute way, it is the dilemma that is faced by people who for many reasons become displaced in the world. Refugees, emigrants and many others can spend a lifetime searching for identity. Kiernan Egan observes that 'the lore that binds a tribe together, and helps to establish each individual's social roles and very sense of identity, is coded into myths'.9 In all mythic narratives the need for order is apparent. Internal harmony is reflected in cosmic harmony and internal strife is reflected in cosmic strife. Our interaction and connection with nature and natural forces are significant. We are part of a whole. Binary oppositions, between land which humans now inhabit and water as the origins of existence, or within a nat? ural order, such as a seed or egg that hold the ingredients of all life, are elements found in the creation myths from around the world. Naturally, local geographical environments had a profound influence on particular myths. Hunting in the bush, drought and the vulture all play their part in African creation myths. In the Oceanic myth, the earth was flat and 54 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004)</page><page sequence="5">featureless until the first creatures interacted with it. Where the ancestral dingo curled up to sleep, a deep bowl was left in the land.The ancestral Emu egg became a giant rock.10 An important part of this process was the naming of objects, since the naming of things brought them into existence. Myths are part of particular geographical areas and particular to specific peoples, reflecting the environment that they inhabit. If myths give a structure to thinking, then that thinking itself has both universal and particular aspects. In Myth and Meaning, L?vi-Strauss highlights the significance of these sto? ries and of the people who created and told and retold them. He points out that people whom we usually consider as completely subservient to self preservation are perfectly capable of disinterested11 thinking: That is, they are moved by a need or a desire to understand the world around them, its nature and their society. On the one hand, to achieve that end, they proceed by intellectual means, exactly as a philosopher, or even to some extent a scientist, can and would do.12 Having made this claim, L?vi-Strauss is not blind to the limitations of what he calls the 'illusion' of understanding the universe. Myth, he claims, gives humans the illusion that they can understand the universe and that they do understand the universe. But, he observes:'It is of course, only an illusion.'13 In Mythologies, Roland Barthes reflects on some of the myths of daily French life between 1954 and 1956. He is clear on the definition of what a myth is: 'Myth is a language.'14 Myth is a way of telling of an event and so Barthes claims that everything can be a myth. Barthes does not see myth as confined to oral speech but as reaching out across photography, cinema, reporting, sport. Barthes, Harpur and L?vi-Strauss claim the world we see is the myth we are in. Myths have a part to play in the lives of humans in the past, present and probably the future. In Metaphysics, Aristotle writes:'This is why the lover of myths is also in a way a philosopher, since myths are made up of wonders.' Myth is, then, the starting point for philosophy. Philosophy Joseph Dunne writes that the fate of wonder may now be a central issue both for philosophy and for education: Heidegger's retrieval of the Presocratics might find a parallel for us in vigilance about childhood: perhaps it is not too fanciful to see Presocratic speculation as the childhood of philosophy, or to see in children some? thing of that original bond with being that Heidegger discerns in the Presocratics. The question which would be fundamental for education DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 55</page><page sequence="6">then is this: can children be schooled without losing their sense of won? der, or having it more or less systematically stifled?15 Are young children philosophers? Children certainly wonder and as they acquire language and engage with their environment, they pursue the adults in their lives with an on-going series of'why's. Egan reminds us that the five-year-old learning to write recapitulates an invention of a few thousand years ago.16 So it is for our critical engagement with and understanding of our existence and surroundings.Teachers in early-years classrooms will con? cur that children are curious and filled with wonder about the stars, the moon, the changing of the tide, where people and pets go when they die and many other universal questions. Children do what the natural philoso? phers did, combining imaginative and rational thinking in order to understand. Egan notes that various philosophers claim that sensitive atten? tion to children's thinking reveals that their thinking routinely includes metaphysical speculation and philosophical reflection of a highly abstract kind. This abstract thinking, according to Margaret Donaldson in her semi? nal work, Children's Minds, is crucial to education. It was Joseph Dunne who in 1989 introduced me to the idea of doing philosophy with children, and who subsequently worked with me and my then class of Senior Infants. 'Thinking Time' was the name given to this evolving process by the children. The process involves the children deciding the topic for discussion, choosing the next speaker or passing the tip and entering into dialogue with peers and teacher. It is not a form of debating where arguments are fought for but rather an openness in the pursuit of truth. No one conclusion is agreed upon but the matter is left open for fur? ther reflection. The role of the teacher is to model and scaffold dialogical language and thought processes alongside facilitating and participating as part of a community of enquiry. Over many years of participating with chil? dren in Thinking Time sessions in the classroom, their interest in 'beginnings' intrigued me. How did God make the world? Who made God? What was there before him? What did the first people do? Where do rain? bows come from? How does the sun know it is morning? It was the children's curiosity on these topics that led me to the natural philosophers, and the significance of the natural philosophers for education is that they are the first known critical thinkers. They thought beyond the myth in which they lived. They brought the gods down from the skies. The signifi? cance of this beginning, the beginning of philosophy in Western society, cannot be overestimated. The theories the natural philosophers put forward on the beginnings of people and animals have strong connections to myths. Empedocles, for example, saw the evolution of animals and people taking place in four 56 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004)</page><page sequence="7">stages. In the beginning, parts of all the species were present but not togeth? er, then the parts grew together. This led to some confusion with the parts of different species trying each other for size. In the third stage, whole, com? plete beings and animals were present. After this the process became redundant because at the fourth stage 'the beauty of the females caused an excitement of the sexual impulse'.17 This theory finds indirect links in many stories, television programmes and even jigsaws enjoyed by young children. Matching the correct head of an animal or bird to the correct body is a frequent exercise in early-years settings. Children often derive great fun from deliberately mixing the species. In many of the fantasy stories read to or by children we have creatures that are neither human nor animal. In Roald Dahl's The Magic Finger a human family have their arms replaced by wings and the duck family develop arms. In Ted Hughes s Tales of the Early World, he calls a chapter 'Leftovers': At the end of his working day, God usually has a few bits left over. Sometimes, just to clear up his worktable, he would stick these together and make a funny-looking mixture of a creature. Then he would breathe life into it. The creatures he made in this way felt very mixed. They had a hard time knowing how to carry on.18 This level of fantasy that appeals to many children and to some adults in terms of science fiction is to be found not only in the thinking of Empedo cles, but also in the great myths. We have Pegasus, the winged horse, and the Minotaur with the head and shoulders of a bull and the body of a man. In Norse legend, the gods made the first humans from the roots of an ash and an elm tree. Indeed the anthropomorphism of bears, pigs and wolves in chil? dren's traditional stories is part of this coming to understanding. Strongly evident in all these theories, speculations and stories is the sense of the unity of things. Humans, animals, the earth itself are all connected in some way to an original source. We are all part of a whole. Before returning to children and education I want to summarise what we can learn from the natural philosophers. In generalized terms, Tha?es, Anax imander and Anaximenes portray reflection, thoughtfulness and a questioning spirit. Xenophanes and Heraclitus take the quest a step further, into metacognition. Empedocles advocated the importance of detailed dis? cussion. Pythagoras and his followers offered a mathematical solution to the great question of the universe. Anaxagoras suggested that through thinking, order comes, and Parmenides promoted reason over the senses. Collectively, these men mark the beginning of critical thinking in Western society. They wondered and reasoned. From the given order of myth, they sought order and understanding through reasoning. DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 57</page><page sequence="8">Children as philosophers I have selected some children's thoughts during school Thinking Time ses? sions on the creation of earth and the universe and the coming of the first people. The children represented here are all in their first three years of pri? mary school. Two of the classes are Dublin based and one is located in Cork. All show that children at a young age wonder about their place within the general order. The story of the birth of Christ has a strong influence on the understand? ing of the beginning of the children in Junior Infants. Other theories put forward are that earth floated from different planets to here and it came from the stars. The latter is couched in story form: 'The planet was coming off the stars and he won the race.' Seaweed, grass and ice are also connected to the creation. 'The world made the world' is an interesting interpretation of nothing becoming something. In the light of Anaximenes' claim, one child's contribution was: 'before the world was made was just air'. Some seem to accept that there was no beginning but that earth was just there'. Others offer the material from which the earth was made, suggesting cement, wood, a combination of cement and clouds and grass and cement. With the moon, stars and the other planets, the children in Junior Infants with one exception all have the sun and moon moving. Where the moon and the stars go during the day is a question that holds great fascination for them, as does the relationship between the sun and the moon. Is the moon the sun with its rays broken off? Are they really just two moons? How does the moon stay up? How does it get its light? These are all matters that intrigued Junior Infants. In one dialogue, a child comments:'Earth is trapped and floating in water. Then stuck there.' Someone still agrees with Tha?es. For Senior Infants, God and science are comfortably mixed. The sun is a ball of fire that God made and it grew and grew and gave us light and heat. 'The moon is actually the sun,' one declares, and another professes that the moon is an egg hatched by the sun. However, compared to Junior Infants there is a significant introduction of scientific fact with the claims that 'the sun is really a big star', and it stays still while it is the earth that moves. With the creation of earth, the children in Senior Infants talk a great deal about friendship. They also try to understand the making of earth from God's per? spective. They come to the conclusion that 'he was a really, really nice guy'. They begin with ideas such as God grew the world from seeds. There is a good deal of fluidity in this dialogue that attempts to work out what was at the beginning. Here a number of children accept there was nothing: 'God let us live here because he didn't want us to walk around on nothing' and 'God made the world on nothing'. Others offer more concrete suggestions, 58 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004)</page><page sequence="9">such as that the earth is made from a big lump of brown muck. They all agree it was created a very long time ago. God's reasons for making the earth intrigue the children. 'He probably got the idea of the moon and then he made the earth.' Some view creation as a cumulative process. God was lone? ly and made people and then made cats and dogs because people were lonely. As well as the universal general question, immediate issues are also present. 'God made the world so they [the children] could learn in school and do takeaway s.' For First Class, the making of the earth and the universe is very much about finding a reason. Initially, the children talk of the earth being made from play-Doh, clay, God's magic powers, special ingredients, DNA and dinosaurs. They then begin to wonder how God came with that particular shape. Why not a triangle or a square? The possibility of engineers being involved is examined. A child then questions the play-Doh argument and puts forward evidence to support his claim that the earth is made from wood and glass. Again we return to the original substance. 'Why not rub? ber?' It is then suggested that evolution is merely God's way of experimenting. He wanted to see 'whether he'd got the hang of it'. Others claim it was all just an accident. 'It was just an extra planet coloured green and white and it had no name and then it was an extra planet and then God made people and put them on the planet and called it earth.' The children were full of ideas about the creation of people. There is a great sense of excitement and energy in the dialogues.'God made the peo? ple and the people ran into the world.' As the conversation evolves, the children view the creation of people in the context of the creation of earth. 'God made the universe and the people, and the people were ghosts.' The Junior Infants identify with Adam and Eve. For them, Adam and Eve watched television, paradise was full of flowers, a waterfall, loads of grass and it was 'down the country'. The older children quickly move to discourse and causation, to the how and the why of the subject. Some support the evolutionary argument that animals evolved into people. They talk of the cavemen who spent most of their time drawing pictures of what they were going to kill on the walls. The detail of how God structured the people is the source of reflection. Bones and meat are seen as the basic ingredient. The process is explained: 'God made seeds first and they were people and then some birds came along and out it into mammies' tummies .'There is also an expression of the aes? thetic side of creation: 'He needed somebody because he was lonely and he wanted somebody to care for him and love them.' Love is seen as central to the creation of people. However, there is the dissenting voice of a young sceptic: 'God was bored with Mary and he made all the people.' DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 59</page><page sequence="10">With all of the classes, and it is particularly noticeable with the children in Senior Infants and First Class, the children will use examples and analogy when a thinking process becomes difficult for them. This emphasizes the importance of encouraging and giving the opportunity to children to express their thinking through such processes. It is a tool for thinking and talking. Equally, it shows the need for teachers to use examples, analogies and story to support the process of understanding in their teaching. Think? ing Time is an opportunity for children to explore possible understandings, to find a voice and put order on their own questions. Certainly, the results show the children are capable of abstract thought and participate in reflection, questioning, making connections, looking for causa? tion and using inferential and deductive reasoning. In teaching terms, while acknowledging the oral and thinking strengths of the children, the elements that are present are interesting inVygotskian terms. They are just within the proximal zone of development and the children have much to gain from their teachers modelling abstract thinking. In my work in progress, compar? ing and contrasting, summarizing, and hypothesizing are central elements. As well as reinforcing and offering the opportunity for the other elements to be practised, occasions such as Thinking Time sessions offer teachers the oppor? tunity to scaffold emerging thinking and talking within a context and topic determined by the children. The significance of these processes emerges when for example Junior Infants distinguish between 'making' a lie and 'telling' a lie. They do compare and contrast when making that distinction. A child in Senior Infants puts forward a thought on whether birds have a language, sup? ports his argument and then deduces a truth. T think it's their bodies and they make nests. They can fly and they have a different body A different body makes a different language. Different bodies make a difference.' Central to doing philosophy is the ability to think in the abstract. This ability, according to Donaldson19 and others, is the key to education. A small example of this dealing with the abstract is shown when the First Class chil? dren are discussing truth. The conversation evolves into discussing truth and happiness. One child says, T think you have to find happiness by going down deep inside you and find it in your heart.' The children wonder can one touch happiness. It is suggested that touching a smiling face is touching happiness. Another child pointing out that 'if you want to touch happiness you have to know if someone is happy' further qualifies this. This in turn is followed by a suggestion that if you want to touch happiness you must get happy Reflection is viewed as part of this process: to be happy, one must be aware of being so. 'You have to find happiness by being somewhere where you're not busy and you have to think about it.' Here we have a lovely example of metacognitive reflection on metacognition. 60 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004)</page><page sequence="11">Oral language and the curriculum The wonderings of the natural philosophers have many similarities with the content of many of the myths of the world and the curiosity of children. There is and has been a universal interest in why we are here and how it all began. In The Beginning of Philosophy Hans-Georg Gadamar writes on the theme of beginning: This theme is not merely of historical interest. It touches on current problems of our own culture, which finds itself not only in a phase of radical change but also one of uncertainty and a lack of self-assurance. We therefore strive to establish connections to altogether different kinds of cultures, cultures that, unlike our own, did not originate in Greek culture . . . Such an examination of the Presocratics does have relevance for us. It deepens our understanding of our own destiny.20 Gadamer claims that language is central to this process: 'The speaking of a language is a totality, a structure within which we have our place ? a place which we have not chosen.'21 With language, there is a need for an openness as a way of being. He suggests that although we usually render the word 'noein in translation as 'thinking', its primary meaning is not to become absorbed in oneself but on the contrary, pure openness for everything.22 Such openness is available in exuberance in early-years classrooms. Philoso? phy, the love of wisdom and the search for truth need dialogue to bring them to life. Dunne refers to such interaction as 'a sort of open texture',23 and he views philosophy as a practice, and as in the case of any other prac? tice, it is only when one gets caught up in doing it that one can learn to get out of it what it has to give. Dunne writes that 'philosophy will serve us only if we surrender to it'.24 Rather than teaching to the one correct answer, philosophy opens up the subject to many possible answers and indeed to the mutuality and openness which Gadamer and Dunne talk of. In the revised Primary School Curriculum (1999) in Ireland language is given a central place in all learning. The curriculum talks of wonder, the child's environment, language, higher-order thinking and collaborative learning as key features of a child's education. These features of the curricu? lum are reflected in the practice of Thinking Time. Critical thinking is also given the seal of approval. . . . the ability to think critically, to apply learning and to develop flexi? bility and creativity [as] factors in the success of the child's life. The curriculum places a particular emphasis on promoting these skills and abilities so that children may cope successfully with change.25 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 61</page><page sequence="12">The connection between critical thinking and coping with change is sig? nificant. It implies autonomy, the right to order one's own life; to cope with change one needs to understand and to make decisions. Such conceptualiz? ing can only be completed through language. The Introduction to the Curriculum then talks of a balance of knowledge, concepts and skills, and places a strong emphasis on developing the ability to question, to analyse, to investigate, to think critically, to solve problems and to interact effectively with others. Within this framework there is a great deal of potential to encourage children into abstract thinking and the language needed for such processes, particularly in the hands of an aware teacher who views language and thought as something more than as well as part of a curriculum. I have some reservations concerning the presentation and grading of the oral language curriculum. The fundamental difficulty that I have is its implied Piagetian stages of thinking. The use of the word 'simple' in reference to the early-years classes, Junior and Senior Infants, needs to be questioned. 'Discuss simple solutions to simple problems,' it ordains.26 Sim? ple for whom? One can only interpret this approach as implying that young children are incapable of abstract thinking or asking complex ques? tions. I would suggest that thinking in the abstract is an integral part of acquiring and refining language. Another strand unit in the infant section of the curriculum document, which demands that children 'ask questions in order to satisfy curiosity about the world', is expanded upon with a list of possible types of questions.27 With the exception of the speculative 'what if category, all the other questions quoted are functional, closed questions implying 'right answers'. With the nine- and ten-year-olds, we see the introduction of seeking possible solutions, cause and effect, and then with the eleven- and twelve-year-olds, discussing matters of 'major' concern. The use of the word 'major' here contrasts with the use of the word 'sim? ple' for the younger children. An aspect of the curriculum strand for the older primary-school children requires that they 'argue a point of view and try to persuade others to support it'.28 I respond by returning to Gadamer's approach to language, one that is characterized by openness and mutuality. If children are to be told that the purpose of their talk is to persuade others that they are right and presumably the other is 'wrong', what is meant by discussion? Is the curriculum advocating sophistry? A word that is not cen? tral in the curriculum is dialogue. This is the difference between debating and philosophizing. With philosophy, it is the content and the search for truth that is central to the dialogue, not the winning of the argument. The English Language: Teacher Guidelines manual (1999) reflects a pattern similar to that of the content manual. While in places it is strong and even radical in its aspirations, it can appear limited in content and pedagogy. Its emphasis is 62 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004)</page><page sequence="13">on encouraging talk. The teacher 'acts as facilitator and mentor, helping the children to be explicit in what they say through modelling responses, thinking aloud, questioning, prompting, clarifying and extending vocabu? lary'. The document worthily proclaims the need to value the children's contributions, but what is lacking is the overall philosophical framework which they could be part of. In summary, there are many very fine ideas and approaches in the Irish Primary School Curriculum. It is a liberal curriculum. It is loaded with high aspirations but in some ways fails to deal with fundamental pedagogical and philosophical issues. This all has implications for teacher education. For teachers to be comfortable with and know how to encourage children to find their own voices beyond the curriculum, to reflect and think critically, they need to have experience of it. Myths, philosophy, democracy and citizenship The myths of the world have been and are a way of putting order on the universe and by so doing ordering thinking. The external ordering became and continues to be reflected in internal ordering, in cognitive processes. Our curriculum is part of this ordering of thought. But as educationalists know well, one cannot give another thinking; it is a process that demands both autonomy and dialogue. One can share knowledge and learn through dialogue from the thinking of others. InVygotskian terms, this is referred to as the interpersonal becoming the intrapersonal. Critical thinking needs to be present within the curriculum within con? temporary structures and myths. Reflecting on and questioning what we know or indeed what we think we know will assist in stretching our knowl? edge base, whether we are adults, adult teachers, or children. What I am suggesting alongside this is that we should encourage children and students and teachers to think and live beyond the curriculum. I have often thought that with the set of books of the Primary School Curriculum, there should also be a blank book, if only to serve a symbolic purpose: to represent the book that children and teachers write for themselves. Activities such as Thinking Time sessions could be part of both the set curriculum and the self-actual? ized or class-actualized curriculum. Such an approach is not unknown and is certainly present in early-years schools in Italy that are modelled on the example of Reggio Emilia's experience.29 DONNELLY, 'Wondering and the World and the Universe', Irish Review 31 (2004) 63</page><page sequence="14">The social sontext of schooling Autonomy is an essential part of democracy and it also impacts on thinking itself. If one never has the opportunity to order one's own learning and thinking, one is without autonomy. The need for a philosophy underpin? ning the education system is called into play here. There is a need for a balance between order, routine and uniformity and autonomy. How do we view our children? The Education Act (1998) and The Children's Act (2001) outline the rules by which children are managed within the law and within the education system. However, the presence of a National Children's Strat? egy offers an important balance to the weight of legislation surrounding our children. I am very supportive of the National Children's Strategy. However, I will pose one critical question to D?il na nOg. I wonder if in finding a public space to hear the voices of children that a replica of the adults' struc? tures is wise? Is a mirror image of D?il Eireann the only democratic structure we can imagine? Do children in particular, and citizens in general need to experience participatory democracy before involving themselves in representative democracy? Are there ways to accommodate both? For children to find a voice and have that voice heard is a reflection of the democracy within which they live. This applies both to schooling and to general citizenship. I began by highlighting three fundamental aspects of the beginnings of democracy in Greece. These were participation, autonomy and a system of justice with the right to appeal. These principles provide a framework for any democratic process, and can be applied to the school set? ting. The mythologizers and the natural philosophers have shown us how we need a framework within which to think. In school terms, this is sup? plied by a curriculum. My own and others' research demonstrate children's ability to enter into dialogue and philosophize. School routines give chil? dren structure and security. But for critical thinking to live we need to think and question beyond the given order. History shows that critical thinkers paid a high price for refusing to remain within the constraints of their time, maybe no one more so than Socrates himself. It is through thought we live. We can learn a great deal about thinking from our myths and from the natural philosophers. As teachers, as citizens with a shared love of the education and wellbeing of our children, we need to think beyond the given and teach within and beyond the curriculum.
