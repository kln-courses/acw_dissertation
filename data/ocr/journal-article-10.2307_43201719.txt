<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Go After a Man-eater that has Killed a Hundred People? Not on Your Life!'1 his paper locates the career of one of the prominent hunter-turned-conservationists - Jim Corbett - within the essential paradox of hunting and conservation in colonial India. As I show, any simple binary of the coloniser- colonised model is inadequate to explain Corbetts prolific hunting in the first half of his life as well as his passionate commitment to the cause of conservation in &gt;S V</page><page sequence="2">the second half. This study demonstrates how, in his dual roles as hunter and conservationist, killer and protector, ruler and saviour, Corbett encompassed the quintessential split image of the British Raj. Particularly in his role as the slayer of man-eating predators, Corbett offers an extremely nuanced and complex image that revises any straightforward impression of imperial hunters in colonial India 'dominating their natural environment' in imitation of imperial domination of Indias politics.2 One of the key questions I ask in this paper is, what caused Cor- bett s passion for hunting in later years, to turn into one for con- servation? Here, I closely examine his changing relationship with Indian wildlife, arguing that the shifts in attitude mirrored changes in his own hunting and professional career. Jim Corbett had modest beginnings within the British colonial structure, starting as a Rail- ways Fuel Inspector. Corbett achieved fame as a hunter and a good shot, and turned to conservation when he was past the peak of his shooting glory. This study demonstrates that Corbetts wildlife com- mitment came much later, when he was in middle age. It also sug- gests that, in later life, Corbett sought to hold on to his fame by becoming a pioneer, not in hunting, but in another related field. His intimate knowledge of Indian wildlife, I argue, could be capi- talised on in showcasing the conservation cause to the wider world. 1 A comment made by a group of sportsmen hunters on a request from Michael Keene, Chief Secretary to the Government of the United Provinces in 1925. The Chief Secretary persuaded them to go after the man-eating leopard of Rudrapray- ag, which had killed more than 1 50 people. The above extract also depicts a sense of irony that even the Chief Secretary was not immune to the wild predators attack; and the issue of governance and British credibility is at stake in the hearts and minds of the native inhabitants, given the fact that pursuing a man-eater was considered a perilous task during this period.

Although Corbett s chief claim to fame was as a shot, he represents a mixed paradigm by his hosting of hosting shikars for Indias topmost officials. Corbett thus presents a curious dilemma. While he did not ques- tion the colonial enterprise of the Raj and fully participated in it during his shooting days, his commitment to wildlife preservation later on was both passionate and very individualised - an extension of his benevolent paternalism towards his local people and environ- ment. As Mahesh Rangarajan puts it, 'Corbett was not a full-throat- ed fighter for the preservation of wildlife, but there were major shifts in his own interests and his public persona'.3 1 exemplify this point with a discussion of the ideals and contributions of Corbett in the field of wildlife protection, which also underlines the paradoxical nature of the colonial hunting and conservation ethos. The analysis discussed in this paper, it would be safe to claim, has not been widely made in existing scholarship. Despite being a prolific and well-known hunter figure, Jim Corbett has surprisingly received little attention in terms of critical appraisal for his role as a conservationist. A range of scholars have touched upon his hunting career, without making any serious effort to bring his attempts at wildlife conservation under scrutiny.4 In his works, Rangarajan likewise offers only partial analyses, de- scribing Corbett as a small force5 in the quest for wildlife conserva- tion, as he was 'saviour of 'almost a dozen tigers that lived within a 3 Mahesh Rangarajan, Indias Wildlife History: An Introduction (Delhi: Perma- nent Black, 2005) p. 70. 4 Stanley Breeden and Belinda Wright, Through the Tigers Eyes: A Chronicle of Indias Wildlife (Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press, 1996); Geoffrey C.

Strahorn too argues that Corbett was essentially a zamindar , owning a terai village near Choti Haldwani, which was not only his hunting ground but also his source of revenue, in rent collected from the local tenants.8 While admitting Corbett as a key conservationist, Strahorn thus overlooks his status as a noteworthy key sportsman-hunter of his time. It is only in a very recent article that Corbett has emerged as the principal subject of any scholarly study. Even so, there, Corbett s repu- tation as a hunter and killer of man-eaters is reinforced and not called into question. Prasanta Das challenges the 'Corbett myth5 arguing that 'seeing him (Jim Corbett) as a pioneering conservationist and protector of the weak is wrong'.9 Instead, he poses the idea of Jim Corbett as a quintessential imperial hunter, fulfilling colonial agendas and bolstering the image of the benevolent ruler-protector. Although he does so only in passing, while offering a comparative perspective on the Mughal and British imperial hunts, Anand S. Pandian agrees that men like Corbett formed a focal point in defining extra-official authority' within the imperial formation of the late British Raj.10 The present analysis, however, offers a very different and far more complex image of Corbett the man and hunter from what 5 Rangarajan, Indias Wildlife History, cit., p. 72. 6 See, Mahesh Rangarajan (ed.)

Pi- geonholing Corbett into a simplistic 'imperialist' mould as Das and Pandian have done is, to say the least, problematic. It does not even adequately appreciate Corbett s own self-representations, evident in the vast amount of writing he left behind. This article further locates Corbett within an analytical framework that recognises the issue of the development of conservation in re- lation to empire and hunting. The issue begs the question of what makes men like Corbett 'interesting' in the past and even today (in Britain or in India) and the politics at stake in writing about such indi- viduals. Richard Grove argues that, 'much of the ideology of modern conservation thinking actually emerged out of colonial rather than metropolitan conditions'.11 It is pertinent, then, to note that 'the con- sensus required to initiate an environmental policy in the colonies was narrower than in metropolitan societies, and the role of a few inter- ested individuals could therefore easily come to acquire considerable significance'.12 In the case of colonial India, Jim Corbett is a prima facie example in bringing such conservation thinking to the forefront. What distinguishes Corbetts career is that, despite being a part of the Raj's establishment, his hunting lore and conservation think- ing were less influenced by the dominant and extant ideologies of the nineteenth century imperial hunters in India and Africa or the ideolo- gies of those who came thereafter. For example, big game shots such as Denis Lyell and wealthy tourist hunters like Theodore Roosevelt participated in a plethora of hunting activities that celebrated 'white dominance, a marker of manliness, and the moral worth of "sports- manship"'.13 Whilst giving attention to hunting as a practical activity, on the whole, they argued for conservation policies aimed at saving the depleting wild animals and for the need to restrict the access of game (for themselves). To borrow from historian John MacKenzie, in a way, such men offer archetypical examples of the late nineteenth century 11 See introduction in David Anderson and Richard H. Grove (eds) Conserva- tion in Africa: Peoples , Policies and Practice (Cambridge: CUP, 1989) p. 23. 12 Anderson and Grove (eds) Conservation in Africa, cit., p.22. 13 Anderson and Grove (eds) Conservation in Africa, cit., p. 50. OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 576</page><page sequence="6">imperial umbrella (in the case of Roosevelt, into the early twentieth century), where indigenous hunters in Africa and India were labelled as poachers' whilst the whites were still permitted to hunt.14 Thus in British India, 'the hunting of animals became the chief recreation of military officers and civilian officials, a source of display and symbolic dominance of the environment'.15 In contrast, Corbett's later-life con- servation thinking in early twentieth century India heralds his deep- rooted commitment to nature and the tiger conservation cause, where man-eaters preoccupied his efforts. Such a conservation ethic can be related to the fact that Corbett had a deep engagement with his local environment in Northern India, especially within the paradigm of the hunter-turned-conservationist as a local expert. Based on a close examination of Corbett s hunting accounts and other essays, this paper situates him along a spectrum - of hunter and conservationist, killer and protector, ruler and saviour - that offers a far more nuanced analysis of his colonial career in India. In many ways, Corbett represented the classic paradox of ruling ideologies - of authority and paternalism operating simultaneously within the same paradigm - which renders him much more inter- esting than other straightforward hunter-sportsmen. Most impor- tantly, this study firmly establishes Corbett as a local figure, residing in the hills near Dehradun (the present-day capital of Uttaranchal State in India), possessing intimate knowledge of his immediate en- virons and communities and deeply committed to the people whose needs he doubtless served. To understand Corbett s position in these terms, this study reads as historically valid his own representations of his life, in much the same way as any other archival documents, while also corroborating this material with other contemporary sources. Corbett s environmentalism, I argue, was, in that sense, but an extension of his personal engagement with the natural world sur- rounding him at Kaladhungi, the village he usually resided in, rather than an extension of any 'imperial' agenda. 14 John M.

Corbetts man-eating tiger narratives are much admired even today, in that they distinguish him from other colonial hunters in India, or even the nineteenth century big game hunters. His localised approach towards the people of Utt- aranchal and the due confession of remorse that he expressed regard- ing the tigers he shot are both factors that make him stand apart. In colonial rural India, predatory attacks on humans, village livestock and colonial engineering works were endemic.16 Corbetts portrayal of the tiger as a gentleman , however, stood out in contemporary wildlife thought and highlighted his support for Indian fauna. Corbett has written some of the most informative books on ti- ger attacks, which goes to show that he understood the nature of man-eating tigers with exceptional insight. The books illustrate clearly why conservation was an issue for him during his later years. Corbetts engagement with tigers is significant and his conservation thinking goes back as early as the 1930s. Corbetts years of close and constant encounters with tigers, his engaging and empathetic nar- rative style and his views on how to co-exist with feral fauna, reveal an intimately informed and personal approach to the relationship between humans and wild predators.17 Even though Corbett pub- lished several gripping accounts of his hunts for the man-eaters of Kumaon and bagged many tiger trophies, his attitude towards tigers was quintessentially paradoxical. 16 Tigers, among other wild predators in nineteenth-century India, threatened colonial construction of dams, reservoirs, engineering and railway construction works, and often people working in these sectors refused to return to work until the colonial government arranged hunters to kill the carnivore in the vicinity.

His ancestry can be traced back to Ireland, where his grandfather, Joseph Corbett, was born in the parish of St. Peters, Belfast in 1796. 18 Joseph married Harriet and they both sailed to India in 1815. Joseph worked in the infantry and horse artillery under the East India Company rule and rose to the rank of sergeant before his death in 1830. 19 Joseph and Harriet had nine children, of whom Jim Corbett s father, Christo- pher William Corbett, was the sixth, Christopher Corbett married in 1845 and followed his fathers profession in the military, and later in the colonial medical service.20 After being widowed, Christopher Corbett married again. He quit the army and took up the job of post-master of the civilian post office run by the colonial government in Naini Tal.21 Christopher Corbett later became the councillor of Naini Tal town, where there was a sizeable European presence. Jim Corbett was born on 25 July 1875 in Naini Tal, to Mary Jane and Christopher Corbett, one of the last children of the Corbett family. As a boy, Corbett grew-up in the surrounds of Kaladhungi and Naini Tal, very much a local, since the family's summers were spent in Naini Tal and winters in Kaladhungi. The children were raised with the help of ayahs' (female maids in India) and, as they grew up, they learned the local tongue as well as Hindi. Corbett, in addition, also developed a curiosity for the surrounding flora and fauna. After finishing his schooling at the age of eighteen, Jim Corbett joined as a railway fuel inspector on a salary of 100 rupees per month.22 Later, he worked as a transhipment inspector for the railways, handling the shipment of goods across the Mokameh Ghat region, and remained in that service for 23 years.23 Corbett was an adept shooter from his childhood days and he further honed his skills in various military enterprises.

Afterwards, he returned to Naini Tal to look after his mother and his two sisters and lived there until Indias independence in 1947. In between, he also served as a Lieutenant Colonel and trainer of jungle warfare for Allied troops in Tanzania during the Second World War. From 1940 to 1942 he served as a Deputy Military Vice-President of the district soldier boards, where he trained soldiers and taught them skills for jungle warfare in Burma.25 Later, Corbett became a Lieutenant-Colonel, hoisted a labour corps and recruited 1,400 Kumaons in the Second World War.26 Corbetts military career is significant, in that he rallied and successfully recruited Indians for the British side during two world wars, which - as we shall see later - did not go unnoticed by the Raj's establishment. His early years were largely spent in Naini Tal and Kaladhungi, where he was cared for by his eldest sister, Maggie. She remained un- married and looked after Corbett from his childhood until his death. Corbetts heart was always in Kumaon and the surroundings of Kalad- hungi, which teemed with a variety of wildlife, including tigers. As a boy, he explored the nearby jungles with his brother Tom and a local man of Irish origin, Dansay. It was Corbetts brother, Tom, who in- troduced him to the use of the gun in hunting.27 Corbett s childhood was full of adventures, hunting jungle fowl for the pot with Tom, and sometimes with a local shikari and village headman, Kunwar Singh. Initially, with the support of Kunwar Singh, Corbett shot small game with his old muzzle-loader gun and made mental maps of the jun- gle.28 During the nights, he often slept in the open with only a small campfire for company. Taking along his dog Magog as his guide and 24 Hawkins, Jim Corbetťs India, cit., p. 3. 25 Corbett, My India , cit., p. 78. 26 Ibid., p. 78. 27 Booth, A Life of Jim Corbetti cit., pp. 42-46. 28 Ibid., p. 23. 581</page><page sequence="11">scout, he learnt of the places to be avoided, spotting tiger marks, and understanding the different tracks of wild animals. It was thus through trial and error, as well as acute observation, that Corbett acquired the skills necessary for a shikari . In his school days, due to fear of walking in jungles alone in the midst of wild predators, Corbett learnt to move noiselessly, to climb trees, to hear jungle sounds, to use his eyes for surveillance and to use the rifle.29 Besides, Corbett taught himself to mimic the sounds of the forest, to track the wildlife and to watch for the warning signals made by different animals. He was brought up with the locals' understanding that tigers were keen to leave humans alone and keep to their own business, if undisturbed.30 Corbetts days in Garhwal thus amply prepared him for his later life, in which he discovered and tackled the most perilous man-eaters of the time and, in terms of experi- ence, placed him above any European hunter in early twentieth cen- tury India.31 lhe reason I highlight Corbetts childhood is to point out that, unlike other colonial hunters, he had gained knowledge of Indian jungles and faunai life as a boy. Such early expertise in jungle life enabled Corbett to pursue man-eaters, often unaided by natives, during the prime of his life. Corbett versus Man-Eaters: A Curious Colonial Paradigm Corbetts attitudes towards conservation cannot be fully appreci- ated unless we take on board his paradoxical stance towards man- eaters. Corbett was a man who appreciated tigers, and yet he pur- sued and killed them, with purpose and for prizes. The first quarter of the twentieth century was a time when tigers and leopards were believed to roam freely with no hindrance from humans, creating a veritable reign of terror where they went. People were afraid to 29 Hawkins, Jim Corbetts India, cit., p. 25. 30 Booth, A Life of Jim Corbett , cit., p .47. 31 See Corbett, My India for Corbett s description of local scenes and the peo- ple he was associated with. OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 582</page><page sequence="12">venture out in the open. Commerce, agriculture and communica- tion were considerably affected.32 Between the years 1907 and 1938, Corbett killed nearly a dozen such man-eaters in the Garhwal and Kumaon region of the United Provinces.33 These tigers and leopards were estimated to have killed at least 1,500 people in that period. While initially it was only the people of Garhwal that enlisted Cor- betts help, subsequently his expertise was much sought after by the colonial government in the United Provinces.34 One of Corbett s vital accomplishments was the killing of á tiger in Champawat that was held responsible for 436 documented human deaths, having terrorised the Kumaon populace since the end of the nineteenth century.35 Roaming in the midst of populated villages, the Champawat tigress became notorious and was the first man-eater ever shot by Corbett in 1907, for which he was awarded a commemora- tive plaque by J. P. Hewett,36 the Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces (See Figure 2). This was one achievement that propelled Corbett into the public eye. Recognition of this kind would later mo- tivate Corbett to pursue other man-eaters in his later years. As humans became an easier form of prey, in the same decade it was also claimed that the Panar leopard killed 400 people before it was shot to death by Jim Corbett in 1910.37 In spite of the lack of press coverage on the Pa- nar leopard, due to its operation in remote Indian jungles, concern for 32 Benjamin Lewis Rice, Mysore : A Gazetteer Compiled for Government (West- minster: Archibald Constable and Company, 1897). 33 Corbett s claims of killing these man-eaters can be corroborated from other sources. Thus, the 'Mohan Man-Eater in colonial government records, was later shot by Corbett. In addition, various officials of the colonial government acknowl- edged Jim Corbett s role in slaying man-eating tigers. See Hawkins, Jim Corbetti In- dia , cit., pp. 218-219.

Corbett claimed to have killed the Panar Leopard upon the request of Berthoud, the Deputy Com- missioner of Naini Tal, and Stiffe, the Deputy Commissioner of Almora. The latter also provided Corbett with information and maps on the whereabouts of the 'Panar Man-Eater.

Mostly striking at night, it killed people in the hills and the plains as well as pilgrims in transit. Between 1918 and 1926, the Rudraprayag leopard killed 125 people.39 Corbett claimed that he hunted this leopard for ten weeks and finally shot it, when most of the sportsmen in the United Provinces declined to take any risk without native assistance.40 Corbetťs hunting exploits made him a noteworthy hunter in his time. But for posterity, especially in post-colonial India, he remains a controversial figure. Mahesh Rangarajan points out that, though, without doubt, Corbett killed man-eating tigers, his narratives of ti- ger killings do not reveal the pride of a sportsman. As he points out, 'the killing of man-eaters was always accompanied by a disavowal of any effort to wipe out the tigers as a species'; Corbetťs behaviour did not measure up to holistic notions of wildlife preservation.41 Tiger conservationist in mid-twentieth century India, Arjan Singh, criticised Corbetťs man-eating tiger narratives as doing a 'disservice (to tigers) by emphasizing the innate savagery of a hard pressed ani- mal'.42 While Singh acknowledges that Corbett was a 'killer with conscience', he has overlooked Corbetťs critical insight into the man-eating habit of tigers. A closer reading of Jim Corbetťs works, corroborated by colo- nial records and memories of people in the Kumaon region, shows there was some truth in his avowed respect for the man-eating pred- ators he killed.43 Despite his extraordinary hunting skills and the 39 Corbett, The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayagy in Jim Corbett Omnibus , p. 457; also see, for an overall account, Jim Corbett, The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag (Oxford: UP, Reprint, 2008) p. 27. 40 Corbett, The Man-Eating Leopard, cit., p. 27. 41 Mahesh Rangarajan, 'Five Nature Writers', in Arvind Krishna Mehrotra (ed.)

Corbetťs slaying of the 585</page><page sequence="15">successful shooting of man-eaters, Corbett s narratives demonstrate his respect for wild predators. In colonial India, a hunters worth was based on the number of fearsome animals he could kill. And yet Corbett prided himself on never having indiscriminately killed a large cat for sport or financial gain. While it may be argued that such remonstrations were necessary to cover his own killer tracks, they nevertheless introduce important ambiguities into the image of him as remorseless killer that those like Singh would have us believe. Despite the tiger-human conflict in colonial India, Corbett was reluctant to categorise the tiger as a man-eater and was wary of de- scribing it as an evil creature. For him, the big cat was a large hearted gentleman of the forest, only preying on people due to unexpected circumstances.44 He regarded nature with reverence and viewed tigers, especially man-eaters, as worthy adversaries.45 Upon killing the Mohan man-eater, Corbett describes how the close proximity of a tiger . . . always leaves (the hunter) with a breathless feeling (of) as much fear as excitement'.46 He openly admired the tiger for its boundless courage, and wrote how unless (there were) public rallies to his (tiger's) support - India will be the poorer by having lost the finest of her fauna . 47 Even though natives were to a great extent prohibited from car- rying firearms in early twentieth century India, Corbett, much like his contemporary, imperial forest officer Edward Stebbing, believed that it was local people's access to guns that had resulted in the mas- sive decline in deer numbers and the indiscriminate slaughter of Rudraprayag man eater was also mentioned in metropolis press, see John oLondons Weekly (1946): 229; Census of India, 1961, p. 8; Office of the Registrar General (India: Manager of Publications, 1961) p. 172.

While Corbett s presumptions may be questioned, his conservation thinking was remarkable for his times. A tiger s role in the system of things is to help maintain the balance of nature. Only on rare oc- casions, when driven by dire necessity', or when their natural food has been ruthlessly exterminated by man do tigers prey on humans. Besides, Corbett believed that the rise of the timber production and the forest department s operation of felling trees were key factors in forcing tigers out of their natural habitat and making them man- eaters. He referred to how the Bachelor of Powalgarh's surround- ings were troubled by extensive fellings by the forest department in 1930; thus the tiger was 'annoyed at the disturbance' and 'changed his quarters'.48 In the case of some tigers, the loss of natural habitat became explosive, as Corbett reports: During the summer of [1938] the Forest Department had marked all the trees in this area for felling, and it was feared that if the [Thak] man-eater was not accounted for before November when the felling of the forest was due to start the contractors would not be able to secure labour, and would repudiate their contracts.49 In the preface to Man-Eaters ofKumaon , Corbett writes: A man-eating tiger is a tiger that has been compelled, through stress of cir- cumstances beyond its control, to adopt a diet alien to it. The stress of cir- cumstances is, in nine cases out of 10, wounds, and, in the 10th case, old age. Human beings are not the natural prey of tigers, and it is only when tigers have been incapacitated through wounds or old age that, in order to survive, they are compelled to take to a diet of human flesh.50 Contrary to the experience of other colonial hunters, hunting became increasingly important in shaping Corbetts conservation thinking. In My India , his collection of autobiographical essays, 48 Ibid., p. 97. 49 Ibid., p. 169. 50 Ibid. See also Harriet Ritvo. The Animal Estate: The English and Other Crea - tures in the Victorian Age (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987) p. 28. 587</page><page sequence="17">Corbett faults a large European hunting party for wounding a tiger with gun-shots and leaving the animal in severe agony for days.51 Corbett also criticised the hunting party for bringing in numerous riding elephants and tying up around fourteen buffaloes as bait to kill the tiger. The gun-shots of the hunting party shattered the tiger s lower jaw which Corbett described as cthe most painful wound that can be inflicted on an animal'. Corbett s contention was that such an injury would make the tiger resort to man-eating and threaten the lives of people and village cattle. He cautioned the hunting party that if the tiger had killed any of his tenants, he would have made them face a charge of manslaughter.52 Afterwards, armed with a heavy rifle, Corbett followed the blood trail of the injured tiger, not with the object of recovering a trophy for others, but with the object of putting the tiger out of his misery.'53 This innate sense of protec- tiveness towards the local people and sympathy for the injured tiger highlights Corbett s deep engagement with his local environment. However, in his writings or public engagements, Corbett remained 'remarkably silent about the tiger shoots he had organized for gov- ernors and viceroys' which considerably muddies his conservation ethic.54 Ironically, Corbett utilised such shoots to boost his conserva- tion programmes in later life, as we shall see. Besides, Corbett refused to hunt leopards, except for man-eaters, even though they were regarded as Vermin at the time. 'Those who have never seen a leopard', he writes: can have no conception of the grace of movement, and beauty of colouring of the most graceful and the most beautiful animal in our Indian jungles. Nor are his attractions limited to outward appearances, for pound for pound, his strength is second to none, and in courage he lacks nothing. To class such an animal as VERMIN, as [is done] in some parts of India, is a crime.55 51 Corbett, My India , cit., pp. 35-37. 52 Corbett, My India , cit., p. 38.

Throughout colonial India, the OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 588</page><page sequence="18">Corbett claimed himself to be a hunter with a purpose and not a gratuitous killer.56 In Corbett's conservation thinking, such attach- ing of cultural and aesthetic worth to wild animals, despite their fearsome atrocities, was quite palpable. Corbett s admiration for formidable predators is mirrored in his respect for the colonial outlaw. A close reading of his encounter with the famous dacoit, Sultana, in the Garhwal region, reveals the same sense of awe and respect for the outlaw as for the wild beasts he killed.57 In colonial India, dacoits were considered a menace both to the ordinary people and the colonial administration, a hindrance, very much like the tigers, to smooth governance.58 Corbett knew that Sultana was a member of the Bhantu community - an ethnic group defined by the colonial government as a criminal tribe'59 - but har- boured a secret sympathy for him, in the same way that he contested the official classification of tigers and leopards as Vermin . When the colonial government offered a special reward for capturing Sultana, dead or alive, by appointing Freddy Young, a police officer in the United Provinces in charge of the Special Dacoity Police Force, Cor- bett's help was sought after to track down the elusive outlaw.60 Corbett's reluctant participation in the hunt is evident in the way his admiration for Sultana finds its way into the narrative: 'I was tiger and the leopard were enlisted as targets for the colonial programme of ver- min eradication.

I had no official standing, and had trouble resulted from our attempt to capture Sultana our ac- tion could not have been justified.'61 Corbett had, on one occasion, found the whereabouts of Sultana and his men while out hunting, an opportunity he in fact did not make use of.62 This favour was later returned by Sultana who spared the lives of Corbett and his friends while they were in Sultanas territory. Mutual respect thus drew the boundaries of these encounters in very much the same way, Corbett seems to imply, as happens in the natural world. However, it would be impossible to think that Corbett was solely altruistic in his motives. He hunted tigers for the thrill of sport too. For example, the Bachelor of Powalgarh and the Pipai Pani tigers were hunted because they possessed great appeal as hunting trophies. Before shooting the Pipai Pani tiger, Corbett reports his observation with pleasure of an unknown tigress and her two full-grown cubs eating a sambur stag they had killed, and considered himself being no poorer for not having secured a trophy . 63 The hunters instinct in Corbett s mind came to the fore when he saw them, but instead he appreciated the tigress' prowess as a hunter and hence did not shoot it. On the other hand, the Pipai Pani tiger was a cub that Corbett had tracked over the years and, as an adult, the tiger was killing cat- tle, gaining a reputation that attracted other sportsmen to bag him. Further, the tiger strayed among village livestock because the forest department in the United Provinces started felling trees and clear- ing the forest cover, depriving it of its natural prey. Prior to forest department's activities, the tiger usually preyed on peafowl, kakar, small pig and chital and lived in the forest. When Corbett shot the Pipai Pani tiger, he gave no apology, and counted himself lucky. Af- ter the animal was shot, he expressed his contentment at securing a 61 Corbett, My India , cit., p. 107. Elsewhere Corbett says, 'There are many fat files in Government offices on the activities of Sultana and his gang of dacoits. I have not had access to these files, and if my story, which only deals with events in which I took part or events which came to my personal notice, differs or conflicts in any respects with Government reports, I can only express my regret.'

Thus Corbetts conservation thinking encompassed both the admiration of the wild and the hunt, which points to how aesthetic considera- tions were more important to him than the hunt itself. Monique Mulder and Peter Coppolillo s argument is persuasive in this context, pointing out that, in the history of the colonial world s conservation thinking, 'the importance of game came more from its aesthetic and cultural value for hunters, rather than its market value'.65 One of the salient features of Corbetts conservation thinking is his reading of anthropomorphic attitudes toward wild animals. As Corbett observes, 'curiosity is not a human monopoly; many an animal's life is cut short by indulging in it. A dog leaves verandah to bark at a shadow, a deer leaves the herd to investigate a tuft of grass that no wind agitated, and a waiting leopard is provided with a meal.'66 Such anthropomorphic views of jungle fauna and his taking pure delight in jungle scenes do attest to Corbetts unique naturalist credentials in his era. Despite such interests, Corbett also took great pride in measuring up his kills as other sportsmen hunters did.67 The Bachelor of Powalgarh (Figure 3) subsequently posed a great opportunity for sport and was much sought after by the hunters in the United Provinces between 1920 and 1930. Contemporary shots such as Fred Anderson and Huish Edye described the Bach- elor tiger as being as big as a 'Shetland pony' and near about 'the size of a donkey'.68 Interestingly enough, the Bachelor of Powalgarh was not a man-eater, nor was it known to attack the village cattle, or petitioned against by the village populace as a trouble- maker. 64 Corbett. My India , cit., pp. 160-168. 65 Monique Borgerhoff Mulder and Peter Coppolillo, Conservation : Linking Ecology, Economics, and Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005) p. 20. 66 Corbett, Man-Eaters ofKumaon , cit., p. 161. 67 Corbett, Jim Corbett Omnibus , cit., p. 111. 68 Corbett, Man-Eaters ofKumaon , cit., p. 97. 591</page><page sequence="21">In addition, by this period, Corbett had come to be known for his photographing, not killing, of tigers. Why then did Corbett kill this tiger, which was not a man-eater? Ar- jan Singh points out that, though Corbett was possibly one of the first conservationists in early twentieth-century India, he also killed many innocent beasts (such as the Bachelor of Powalgarh) following the 'in- ner compulsion of a hunter.69 After the Bachelor was shot and carried back to his home with the help of twenty men, Corbett confirms, my sister and I measured him from nose to tip of tail, and from tip of tail to nose ... to make quite sure we had made no mistake ... These measurements are valueless ... Wyndham [the Commissioner of Kumaon] said the tiger was ten feet between pegs, which would give roughly 1 0' 6" over curves; and while one shikari said he was 10' 5" over curves ... my sister and I measured the [Bachelor was] 1 0' 7" over curves.70 Although in his writings he never explicitly reveals hunting for sport, nonetheless his photographs do illustrate the fact that, in a manner similar to the nineteenth century big game hunters, Cor- bett indeed derived occasional fulfilment from shooting wild animals deemed worthy of the kill. Figure 3 unmistakably reveals Corbett s sense of triumph as a sportsman hunter, as he poses rather nonchalant- ly with the large predator that eventually became his trophy. Hence, the presumption that Corbett killed only man-eaters is erroneous. Be- sides, the increasing press coverage on man-eaters during this period, it can be argued, also enabled hunters like Corbett to justify the exter- mination of troublesome tigers. This spectacle of terror was as much 'imagined', constructed' and 'felt' as it was real, with Corbett, to a certain extent, exaggerating the panic and destruction caused by the man-eaters to justify their killing. Corbett the hunter and imperialist thus were never very far from Corbett the conservationist with local credentials. In many ways, he represented the classic colonial paradox - of might and benevolence co-existing within the same paradigm. In that sense, at least, Corbett was very much a product of his times. 69 Singh, The Legend of the Man-Eater, cit., p. 83. 70 Corbett, Man-Eaters of Kumaon, cit., p. 108.

Corbett: the local hero? Jim Corbett s championing of the cause of Indian wildlife and its habitat was but an extension of his projected empathy for the local people. Protecting their environment was central to his con- servationist agenda, as much as safeguarding them against it. His photographs, posing with man-eating tigers, reveal Corbett s innate desire to claim trophies of a different kind - motivated by a moral vindication of sorts,71 whereby the beast had been vanquished and 71 Corbett s hunting included different methods in pursuit of his quarry. With man-eaters operating in remote jungles in the United Provinces, it became indis- pensable for him to sit on machans or tree-platforms, mostly alone in the nights, drenched in the rain, a method that was not so keenly taken up by other contem- porary hunters. 593</page><page sequence="23">human loss avenged (Figure 4). Susan Sontag's critique on photog- raphy, where she likens the camera to a gun, maiming others in dif- ferent ways - for instance, in its creation of a kind of sensationalism and witnessing or revealing other people s suffering - is relevant in this context.72 Corbett s photo shoots of man-eaters are remarkable for the inclusion of the victims' families and affected populations. Almost invariably, in every photograph, the dead predator was pa- raded as a proof of Corbetts ability to bring justice to sufferers and restore normality in their daily lives, even as he also effectively used such photographs to sensationalise the man-eaters' atrocities and publicise his hunter-saviour credentials. Corbett always maintained strong ties with the local populace and prided himself on being able to save their lives, particularly those of the older people and innocent children, as well as those of the vil- lage cattle.73 In his prolonged hunting encounters with man-eaters, Corbett repetitively released entire villages from reigns of terror un- leashed on them by powerful predators. In Corbett s own heroic nar- rative, a girl who had been struck dumb when she had witnessed her sister being carried off by the Champawat man-eater, regained her speech when Corbett told her of the man-eater's death,74 and visited her place to show the cranium and skin of the tigress, thus assuring her that retribution had been gained for her sister s death.75 What would have endeared him to the local people was his strong sense of purpose at a job, despite the risk posed by notorious man-eaters, a challenge which many sportsmen hunters or local shikaris did not take up or which others had left unfinished. A question that arises at this point is, why did local people agree to be in Jim Corbetts photographs? The answer perhaps lies in their 72 Susan Sontag, Regarding the Pain of Others (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003). 73 See 'The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag, in The Jim Corbett Omnibus , p. 452; Hawkins, Jim Corbetts India cit., p. 88; Corbett, The Temple Tiger and more Man-Eaters ofKumaon (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1954). 74 Susie Green, Tiger (London: Reaktion Books, 2006), p. 74.

The man with the gun represented their only possibility of salvation and the photographs were a record of their helplessness. Diana Taylors argument that the public spectacle of terror was aimed, 'to produce identity with the state by constituting subjects as passive and feminized spectators' is relevant in this context.76 In these hunting narratives, 'the utter incapacity of native villagers in the face of a tiger s terror is resolved only by the heroic inter- vention of the colonial hunter'.77 The Talla Des man-eater image (Fig- ure 4) thus signified a decisive end to the man-eater's reign by placing the last victims grandson next to the dead tiger. Such photographs offer an iconic representation of Corbetťs complexities and can be read both as justifying vengeance on behalf of the local populace who had lost their relatives or cattle as well as his unique raison d'etre for killing trou- blesome tigers or leopards.78 Joan Schwartz and James Ryan too point out that the introduction of camera into the colonial world greatly ben- efited European men by allowing them to bring photographs as 'facts of the age and of the hour', useful for controlling and classifying facts, and in maintaining their imperial duty while publicising their interests.79 When it came to the question of contested priorities and loyal- ties, Corbett, however, always believed that he stood by the peo- ple of Garhwal and Kumaon. There is a cautious streak in Corbett, which accounts for his acting in ways that were critical and wary of the administration, though he never did directly question the au- thority of the colonial government. Jim Corbett stands out in his hunting narratives less as a representative of a formal administrative apparatus and more like a local people's man.80 While he admired 76 Diana Taylor, Disappearing Acts: Spectacles of Gender and Nationalism in Argentinas 'Dirty War (Durham: Duke University Press, 1997), p. 89; Pandian, Predatory Care : 87. 77 Pandian, Predatory Care : 87. 78 Corbett, Man Eaters of Kumaon, cit., pp. 74-5. 79 Joan Schwartz and James Ryan, Picturing Place: Photography and the Geo- graphical Imagination (London: I.B.Tauris, 2003) p. 2. 80 Sahib is commonly added to the colonisers' names in colonial India as a mark of respect. Often, it also is a nod in the direction of the paternalistic atti- tudes of the British men during the colonial period. 595</page><page sequence="25">Figure 4. The grandson of the last victim of The Talla Des Man-Eater81 State Central Library: Hyderabad, India. individual friends who were part of the colonial apparatus, he simul- taneously recorded great respect for local people.82 While in pursuit of the Mohan man-eater in Kartkanoula, Corbett recalls how at first 81 Jim Corbett, The Second Oxford India Illustrated Corbett , (Oxford: OUP, 2006) pp. 91-120. The Talla Des Man-Eater was a tigress that killed 150 people. It roamed in Talla Des and its environs for eight years before being shot to death in April 1929 by Jim Corbett. Images like this evoke Corbett s paternalistic sense of fulfilment in acting in favour of the local populace of Kumaon and Garhwal. 82 See Hawkins, Jim Corbett s India , on the episode of the Muktesar man-eater, pp. 86-88. Corbett s protective instinct was apparent when he was in pursuit of the Muktesar man-eater upon the local governments request. When he set off in the direction of Muktesar, he came across a village girl, Putii, who had difficulty with one of her bullocks (Kalwa) while passing through the man-eater s territory. The girl eventually conversed with Corbett in a bold manner, which was uncom- mon between the locals and Europeans during this period. It was, however, Cor- bett s localised approach that earnt him their trust. Corbett finally escorted Putii OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 596</page><page sequence="26">he was vigorously interrogated by a village woman, and was finally welcomed when he managed to convince her that he was neither a forest officer nor a policeman, but just someone who had come to the village to help the people.83 The villagers eventually were glad to provide him with ample supply of food and other amenities until he had finished hunting the Mohan man-eater.84 It is significant that the villagers preferred to bypass the admin- istration when seeking his help in tackling troublesome predators. Occasionally, appeals for shooting man-eaters were submitted di- rectly to Corbett by villagers, and not to the colonial officials. In 1933, thus, a petition was submitted by 'the public of Patti Painaun, Bungi and Bickla Badalpur in the District of Garhwal to Corbett, pleading him to deal with the Kanda man-eater, which had become a danger to the lives and livelihoods of people in their villages: in this vicinity a tiger . . . turned out man-eater ... [and] up to this date he has killed 5 men and wounded 2 ... we public are in great distress. By the fear of this tiger we cannot watch our wheat crop at night so the deers [sic] have nearly ruined it. We cannot go in the forest to graze [as] so many of our cattle are to die. Under the circumstances we are nearly to be ruined. The Forest offi- cials are doing every possible arrangement to kill this tiger but there is no hope of any success. 2 shikari gentlemen also tried to shoot it but unfortunately they could not get it. Our kind District Magistrate has notified Rs. 150 reward for killing this tiger, so everyone is trying to kill it but no success. We have heard that your kind self have killed many man-eater tigers and leopards. For this you have earned a good name specially in Kumaon revenue Division. The fa- mous man-eater leopard of Nagpur [?] has been shoot [sic] by you. This is the voice of all the public here that this tiger also will be killed only by you. So we and Kalwa to the girls uncles place before embarking on the task of shooting the Muktesar man-eater. The notable fact here was that he was dispatched by the government on this occasion to shoot the man-eater, but his inclination to protect the locals, as in most instances, remained his priority. 83 Hawkins, Jim Corbetťs India , cit., pp. 222-5. This was a time of politically unsettled conditions, due to the impact of the Indian freedom struggle which had also spread to Kartkanoula, and hence most colonial officers were rarely assisted by the locals. For political unrest in this region, see, Pt. Govind Ballabh Pant, For- est Problems in Kumaon (Nainital: Gyanodaya Prakashan, 1922). 84 Hawkins, Jim Corbett's India, cit., pp. 225-6. 597</page><page sequence="27">the public venture to request that you very kindly take trouble to come to this place and shoot this tiger [our enemy] and save the public from this calamity.85 This petition letter in rusty bureaucratic English, framed by Go- vind Singh, the headman of Jharat village on the behalf of the villag- ers, is interesting given the state of affairs in rural parts of colonial India at the time. Following Gandhi s Civil Disobedience movement of the 1930s, this was the height of the Indian freedom struggle, which spread to rural and tribal regions. In spite of this, Corbett was unhesitatingly being approached by the villagers for the proposed rescue operation. The petition is also a proof that, even though tiger numbers were in rapid decline in the 1930s, the colonial govern- ment was still offering bounties to kill them. Corbetts colonial prerogative to use firearms, however, some- times proved to be a predicament. In My India&gt; Corbett describes how the wife of Moti, one of Corbetts hunting companions, on one occasion complained to Corbett that wild pigs climbing the fence to her fields were eating her potatoes and destroying her crops.86 Finding local men incapable of protecting her crops, Moti's wife challenged Corbetts prowess as a hunter to shoot the animal; if he could not shoot the pig, Corbett was asked to at least 'raise the wall a few feet so that no pig could climb over it.' It so turned out that the wall that Corbett built was no deterrent either. As Moti s wife again complained: 'now, Sahib, what about the pig, the son of the shaitan (evil) who climbed your wall and ate my potatoes? . . . these others cannot shoot it and I am tired of sitting up all night and beat- ing a tin can.'87 Corbett eventually killed the truant pig, but such liberty as apparently acceded to Moti s wife underlines a deep sense of responsibility and empathy that Corbett held for the local people, which sets him apart from the British contemporaries of his times. It should be noted that this type of paternalism, while it created bonds between Corbett and the local populace, did not require him 85 Corbett, Man Eaters of Kumaon,út., p. 154. 86 Corbett, My India , cit., p. 30. 87 Corbett, My India , cit., p. 32. OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 598</page><page sequence="28">to break away from the colonial apparatus. These instances illustrate invaluable liaisons between the villagers of the Garhwal and Kumaon and Corbett, who lived and hunted there for most of his life.88 William K. Storey also notes how Corbett had due respect for his subordinates. His own accounts of friendship with his most trusted Indian assistants - of whom Kunwar Singh and Bahadur Khan figured in many of Corbetts stories as 'hunts- men in their own right' - testify to his close ties with them.89 There can be no doubt that Corbett projected himself with intent as a man with local credentials, and representing local interests. Corbetts paternalism discussed above is problematic; nonethe- less, it paved the way to wildlife conservation. Benevolent pater- nalism towards the local populace and establishing credentials with them are both archetypal white colonial prerogatives, but it is Cor- bett s unofficial standing that makes his case interesting. Thus, part of the ideology of colonialism translates in Corbetts case into a sense of loyalty towards the people of the hills; nevertheless, this was not free from the politics of his conservationist agenda. Arguably, this position could be stretched also to cover his interactions with tigers and other wildlife in the Garhwal and Kumaon jungles, an aspect which we now turn to. Corbett as a Conservationist: From Gun to Camera Corbett s concern for conservation arose when he came to realise the effects of wide-scale hunting expeditions and large-scale colonial forest clearance in the 1930s. Corbett, during this period, saw that 88 Ibid., p. 32. His treatment of Kunwar Singh reveals his benevolent pater- nalism at work: Corbett visited Kunwar Singh on his deathbed, encircled by his mourning family. Not convinced that his friend was dying, Corbett ordered the people to leave the hut and threatened to burn down the village if Kunwar Singh was not well looked after by his family. 89 William K.

He was apprehensive of shikar parties increasing their hunts as forests began to recede. Though Corbetts later life, from the 1930s onwards, shows him as a conservationist with a legitimate concern, he did not completely put down the gun or adopt a man-eaters only approach. The successful organisation of many shikar trips for prominent colonials during this period was complemented by Corbett devel- oping a remarkably distinctive method of raising awareness of the conservation cause. From the mid- 1920s onward, Corbett began or- ganizing shikar shoots for colonial officials, and gradually acquaint- ed himself with the highest ranks of British India, including the Viceroy Lord Linlithgow in the 1940s.90 It is not a coincidence that it was around the same time - i.e., from the 1930s onward - that Corbett started persuading the provincial authorities to work for the conservation of wildlife. Corbett s concern for conservation developed through learning and borrowing from earlier thoughts on wildlife preservation espoused by local forest officers. As early as 1907, the local government proposed the establishment of a game reserve in the region.91 Later, it was two imperial forest officers, E.R. Stevens and E.A. Smythies, who actually planned the scheme for the creation of a wildlife sanctuary in 1916 and 1917, respectively.92 Their proposals were initially turned down by Percy Wyndham, the Commissioner of Kumaon, who feared the loss of his shikar opportunities.93 Later on, when Smythies became the hunting companion of Corbett in Kaladhunghi, together they worked with the Governor of the United Provinces, Sir Malcolm Hailey, as 90 Lord Linlithgow also wrote the preface for Corbetts book, Mart-eaters of Kumaon , published in 1944 by OUP. 91 P.C. Tiwari and Bhagwati Joshi (eds) Wildlife in the Himalayan Foothills : Conservation and Management (New Delhi: Indus Publishing, 1997) p. 208. 92 Two forest officers, E.R. Stevens and his successor E.A. Smythies, had pro- posed the creation of a sanctuary in 1916 and 1917, respectively, and their pro- posals were turned down by the then provincial government.

Hailey was personally known to Corbett.94 In 1929, Corbett had conducted a shikar shoot for him in his native village, Kaladhungi, where a tiger and several leopards were shot.95 Besides, Corbetts frequent fishing trips with Malcolm Hailey on the Ramganga river were instrumental in mak- ing the latter aware of the rich wildlife in the area. Despite opposition from sportsman hunters like Wyndham, after twenty years of lobby- ing, Corbett and Smythies successfully persuaded Hailey to establish a national park.96 Their success is testimony to Corbetts considerable political influence gained over the course of time. Corbett s astute manipulation of Hailey for the cause of conser- vation is noteworthy, a point that has gone largely unnoticed in ex- tant scholarship on him. With Hailey s help and a series of efforts between 1933 and 1935, Corbett succeeded in the creation of a wildlife sanctuary launched in 1935 in the Kumaon hills.97 Later, in post-colonial India, named the Corbett National Park, it covered over 300 square kilometres of the Ramganga region. Hunting was prohibited in the reserve, which was owned and managed by the local forest department so as to create ideal breeding conditions for wildlife.98 Protective legislation affecting the wildlife in the park was far advanced for its time in comparison to anywhere else in colonial India. It declared the disturbing of any mammal, reptile or bird' as constituting a severe offence, and was a significant precursor to later, more comprehensive, wildlife laws.99 94 A.K.

As the shots rang out, echoing through the entire valley, in a matter of minutes 300 waterfowl were deci- mated. Corbett greatly regretted having taken the three officers out for the shoot.100 Corbett later described this as a turning point in his life, for thereafter he never shot an animal except for food or if it was 'dangerous . 101 A.G. Atkins, a pastor at the Union Church in Naini Tal, who met Corbett during a wildlife lecture at the local college paraphrases Corbett s experience thus: it was simply unrestrained slaughter for the crude pleasure of it. Said Jim (Cor- bett): "That sickened me and opened my eyes to what ordinary uninhibited hunting and shooting meant. I resolved from that time that I would use my jungle lore for a different kind of shooting, and in that way I began to take photographs of wild animals and jungle life. It requires much more of my skill and gives me an even greater thrill to get good pictures of my animals than when I used to hunt just to kill.102 By the mid-thirties, Corbett had nearly abandoned hunting ex- cept for man-eaters. In his later life Corbett solely diverted his ef- forts towards ensuring protection for wildlife, advocating cameras instead of guns, and began to capture tigers on film. As his passion for photography developed, he began to write about its virtues com- pared to those of killing game: ger by the Government of India in 1973. Also See P.C.

Champion, a wildlife photographer and a gifted natural- ist in colonial India, who wrote an informative book, With a Camera in Tiger-Land (1927), about his long experiences with Indian tigers and other wildlife.105 Corbett was greatly inspired by Champion and started using his own cine-camera.106 Despite repeated initial disap- pointments in capturing tigers on film, Corbetts courage and pa- tience were rewarded, as proven by the amount of film he managed to make in close proximity to the animal subjects. Later he maintained a box camera and took many photographs. For several months, Corbett went out daily and waited for a tiger to appear, and obtained a long sequence of six specimens, of which the nearest was eight and the farthest thirty feet from his camera'. Initially preserved at the British Film Archives and now deposited in the Natural History Museum, London, these photographs are the earliest notable visual records of Indian wildlife.107 In addition, Corbett had successfully obtained 600 feet of film recording six full-grown tigers.108 Corbett also wrote in support of conservation.

Here, Corbett implores people not to sit over water holes at night and kill deer as they came to drink'.110 Elsewhere he questioned the assertion that tiger numbers were on the rise, based on the number of village cattle that had been killed: 'this is not due to the tigers having in- creased but due to the balance of nature having been disturbed by the unrestricted slaughter of the game'. He was openly critical of the colonial forest department and alleged that tigers were driven out of their natural habitat and diminishing due to the forest department s activities.111 He wrote, A Country's fauna is a sacred trust ... shooting over water, shooting over salt- licks, natural and artificial, shooting birds in the close season and when roosting at night, encouraging permit-holders to shoot hinds [of animals], fencing off of large areas of forest, and the extermination by the Forest Department of all game within these areas ... shooting from motor cars, absence of sanctuaries and burn- ing of the forests by the Forest Department . . . when the forests are full of young life are all combined to one end - the extermination of our fauna.112 The recent work of Annu Jalais on tigers in the Sundarbans war- rants close attention in this context.113 Jalais' study shows how in the late 1970s hundreds of Bengali refugees (who came from pre- sent-day Bangladesh) were given shelter in Morichjhanpi, a forested island in the Sundarbans. But when tigers started attacking and killing people, the government authorities later forcibly evicted the refugees, saying that they had violated forest laws that actually en- shrined greater protection for Royal Bengal tigers. The Morichjhan- 109 A contemporary local journal published from Government Branch Press, Naini Tal. 110 Jim Corbett, 'Wildlife in the Village', Review of the Week , Naini Tal 1932. 111 Booth, A Life of Jim Corbett , cit., pp. 258-260. 112 Indian Wild Life, 1, 1936. 113 Annu Jalais, Forest of Tigers: People, Politics and Environment in the Sundar- bans (London: Routledge, 2009).

As Jalais points out, for the Sundarban islanders, the significant question lay in the forest, i.e., its terrify- ing protagonist - the man-eating tiger. There was no government engagement with local ways or any attempt at understanding the reasons tigers have become man-eaters. Comparison helps us un- derstand how, unlike the 1970s Morichjhapi incident - which was a failed conservation effort in post-colonial South Asia - Corbetts tiger conservation model was a success, even though it took shape in the 1930s British Raj. As discussed in this paper, Corbetts pro- gramme did not alienate the local populace, unlike the Morichjhapi tragedy, which created ruptures between the government, tigers, and the refugees. Of course it should be noted that Jalais' study on tigers in the Sundarbans and Corbetts conservation thinking in this paper are separate case studies which took place in different historical con- ditions and geo-cultural and political settings. Corbett s conservationist attempts went further when he attended local schools and societies to raise awareness of the need to conserve forests and wildlife. Corbett was one of the editorial members of the short-lived Indian Wild Life journal114 and served as the secretary for the United Provinces Game Preservation Society (1932), which was instrumental in airing early thoughts on wildlife conservation in In- dia.115 Working closely with the preservation society, which brought out 36 volumes of the journal Indian Wild Life , Corbett conducted other activities such as the cataloguing of faunai life and observing jungle animals.116 Corbetts position in favour of conservation grew increasingly firm in later years. After the end of the Second World War, when groups from Garhwal and Kumaon approached him to shoot troublesome tigers, Corbett turned down such requests and, in- 114 Hawkins, Jim Corbetts India , cit., p. 4. 115 The Indian Forester 83 (1957); William Beinart and Lotte Hughes (eds.) Environment and Empire , (Oxford: OUP, 2007) p. 297; William Mark Adams, Against Extinction: The Story of Conservation (London: Earthscan, 2004) p. 92. 116 Rangarajan, Indias Wildlife History , cit., pp. 7 0-72. 605</page><page sequence="35">stead, reimbursed them.117 But not all were happy. Upon his buffalo being killed by a tiger, a villager of Choti Haldwani refused to listen or accept any compensation from Corbett. Instead, he admonished Corbett s photography and demanded that he kill the tiger, an in- stance of Corbetts paternalism not working.118 It is interesting to see this later position on conservation brought Corbett into sometimes noisy disagreement with the villagers, just as his former role in killing the man-eaters brought him closer to those whose lives and livestock he saved right away. This shift affected Corbetts relationships with the local people as he went from being a hunter to a conservationist. However, Corbett recouped their loyalty in the end by bequeathing his lands to the villagers of Choti Haldwani after he left India. Whilst Corbetts efforts for the preservation of tigers were re- markable in the early twentieth century history of Indias wildlife conservation movement, it should, however, be noted that he re- mained a staunch empire loyalist until his death. In that sense, his thoughts on wildlife conservation remain just a caveat. A question arises then as to whether Corbett s empathy for the local people also contradicts his close relationship with the colonial machinery? There is a clever streak in Corbett in the way he moulded his local creden- tials without breaking from the British imperial enterprise. For Cor- bett, the people of Kumaon and Garhwal mattered just as much as his loyalty to the Raj: thus his benevolent paternalism and extension of his imperial authority went hand in hand, and notably remained unchallenged despite his unofficial standing. Jim Corbett stands out as hunter-turned-conservationist, who lived in the Indian jungles, identified himself as a local people s man, understood tigers with exceptional insight and thus orchestrated his own making as a leading proponent of the colonial conservation movement. Realising that his image as a slayer of man-eaters did not fit in with the first quarter of the twentieth century, Corbett was able to refashion his persona. Hobnobbing with the British colonial big- 117 Jim Corbett, Jungle Lore (New Delhi: OUP, 1999) p. 49; Rangarajan, In- dia's Wildlife History , cit., p. 72. 118 Ibid., p. 72. OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 606</page><page sequence="36">wigs, he took advantage of his connections in official circles to for- mulate the conservation thinking of his later life. Even though Cor- bett s conservation thoughts were significant at the time, and given that he successfully negotiated with the colonial authorities for the tiger conservation cause, it is pertinent to note that Corbett orches- trated his thinking differently, to his own advantage, after carefully observing events between the two world wars. During this period, the colonial government permitted the widespread decimation of Indian forests for war building purposes, resulting in severe habitat loss for the Indian wildlife that Corbett had found fame by hunting. In this context, Corbett managed his own changing circumstances (there was little future for the big game hunter) by projecting him- self in his later years as a budding colonial conservation protagonist. Despite the Indian government officially declaring the Ramganga wildlife sanctuary 'Corbett National Park' in 1955-56, Corbett left India in 1947, fearing that he could not continue in an independ- ent India ruled by Indians, a fact that further muddies his otherwise glorious championing of the cause of tigers. Corbett s letter written to a Mr. Brander on 25 September 1947 aptly proves his staunch imperialist credentials: It is India, the real India, who for two hundred years [under our British rule] has lived in peace and happiness under the rule of a handful of [British] men, [now] enjoying the freedom that has been thrust on her by a parcel of fools [Indian nationalists?]. The India that you and I loved [i.e. the British Raj] has been sacrificed on the altars of ambition and greed, and has gone forever.119 After Indias independence in 1 947, Corbett left to Kenya with his sister Maggie. Like the majority of Anglo-Indians who left India for good, Corbett found a home in Kenya which became full of (Brit- ish) people who 'forget their troubles and make new homes them- selves'.120 Kenya is significant for Corbett on two accounts. Firstly, 119 See Corbett s letter to Brander, from Gurney House, Naini Tal, India, 25 Sept. 1947 in Jim Corbett, My Kumaon - Uncollected Writings, (New Delhi: OUP, 2012) p. 77. 120 Ibid. 607</page><page sequence="37">it was the place where he once hunted lions with Percy Windham and where they jointly owned a coffee estate near Mt. Kilimanjaro, bought in 1922. 121 Secondly, after moving to Kenya, Corbett main- tained an elite safari enterprise called 'safarilanď and settled down at Paxtu cottage where erstwhile imperial official Baden Powell spent his final days. Despite such ventures, Corbett maintained his con- servation philosophy of discouraging killing and encouraging pho- tography. In 1952, at Nyeri, he organized a tree-top excursion for Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and to her royal party. Corbett was deeply moved by the royals' presence. On leaving Ku- maon behind, he ensured that his memory would be cherished by gifting his 221 acres of land to the villagers and paying their taxes until his death in 1955. 122 Conclusion A critical analysis of the life and career of Jim Corbett offers vital information on the role of individuals in shaping colonial agendas and the image of the Raj. For Corbett, his years of expertise based on his tiger conservation work in the surroundings of Kaladunghi consti- tuted a real engagement with the local environment. As a triumphant killer of dangerous predators and the upholder of the natural envi- ronment, Corbett represented significant interventions in the colo- nial programme of Vermin eradication and conservation. Far from being just a cog in the colonial machinery on these issues, he lent a very passionate and personal agenda to the programme, inflecting its operation in unique ways. Accordingly, Corbett stood firmly against indiscriminate slaughter of wildlife, in particular tigers. Even in his killing of man-eaters, as this paper has shown, the projection of both remorse and vindication by Corbett renders him a remarkable figure within the colonial paradigm on hunting and conservation. Despite his remarkable conservationist agenda, the article has also demonstrated how Corbett remained a lifelong imperialist. He was 121 Ibid., pp. 78-9. 122 Jim Corbett, Tree Tops (Oxford: OUP, 1955). OTHER RESEARCH ARTICLES / MANDALA 608</page><page sequence="38">awarded the Freedom of the Forests, the Kaiser-i-Hind gold medal in 1928 and the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E) in 1942 and was made a Companion of the Indian empire (C.I. E.). 123 Such recogni- tion proves beyond doubt Corbett s contributions to the Raj in the United Provinces of north India, in the form of two vital contribu- tions. Firstly, rallying Indians for the Allied forces in support of the British cause during the two world wars; and secondly, 'ridding the countryside of man-eating carnivora , thereby rendering the villag- ers and their livelihoods safe and thus working for the betterment of agriculture and safeguarding the colonial revenue base. However, it was the tiger conservation movement that remained at the heart of Corbetťs personal agenda. This article cautions that the wider histo- ry of conservation thinking should pay due attention to critical and historical analysis of individuals like Jim Corbett, whose individual approaches to conservation issues were drawn from lived experience just as much as from broader colonial attitudes. 123 Jerry A.
