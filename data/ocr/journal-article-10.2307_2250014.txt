<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Social Substance of Religion. By GERALD HEARD. London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1931. Pp. 318. lOs. 6d. IN his first book, The Ascent of Hurmanity, Mr. Heard attempted to interpret various historical phenomena in terms of individualism rising above and conflicting with groupism. His thesis was that mans ' social nature' means more than we think it does; it is not merely that men are sensitive to other men who belong to the same group, not merely that they have formed groups and subsequently got caught up in the social wheels which thev have set in motion, but that he was once far more profoundly social than he is now. In fact the order which Mr. Heard suggests is the reverse of that as- sociated with the making of a social contract. According to Mr. Heard humans develop self-consciousness out of a non-individualised state in which an individual hardly distinguishes himself from other individuals who belong to the same group. There is, of course, something more in The Ascent of Humanity than this thesis of develop- ment in the direction of Individualism, and that is the theory of spiral movement back again in the direction of a new susceptibility to the pull of the group. There is a fundamental difficultv in these behaviouristic inferences. We cannot know what goes on in the minds of primitive peoples as we know them, and we cannot know what went on in the minds of our ancestors. We watch their behaViour and interpret it in terms of some scheme or other which gives us a coherent and con- sistent storv. It is the fashion to begin books on general psychology with an account of the reactions of infusoria and other minute and simple organisms, because we can thereby give a clear picture of a biological scheme of self-preservation in an environment. We point out how the creatures are sensitive to elements in their neighbourhood and make reactions to or from them. Just so', we say, does man respond to his environment with sentience and move- ments of attraction and repulsion. When, however, we come to man, we drift insensibly backwards and forwards from psychological</page><page sequence="2">GERALD HEARD, The Social Substance of Religion. 219 formulations to biological and physiological formulations. We sometimes seem to forget that the seeing of an object is one thing and the physiological response to light stimulation.is another, and that conation is a different order of concept from cognition and affect. When we are treating of social behaviour we are immediately provided with an ambiguous verb-' to be conscious of '-which derives its ambiguity from the two-fold attitude towards behaviour of which I have been speaking. ' I am conscious of my fellow men' may mean ' I anm aware of the existence of other people', or 'I am moved to compassion or detestation of other people '. When I say " I become more conscious of other people as I grow older ', the point -is clearer still. As a matter of fact we usually mean that we become more sensitive to the distresses of others and that our behaviour indicates a kindlier disposition, or at any rate that our actions are determined by other people to a greater extent than before; but our language makes us think that we are talking about a change in the way in which we are conscious rather than a change in the sorts of things of which we are conscious. This ambiguity makes it very difficult to be clear in our minds about what we are asserting with regard to primitive man whein we say that he is conscious of his fellows in a different way from the way in which we are conscious of the people about us. It is quite clear that his behaviour is determined in a way which we can render more understandable by referring it to the needs of the group to which he belongs. His behaviour seems influenced by the instincts of consolidation and self-preservation of the group, considered as the ' owner ' of the instincts, and he is highly sensitive to stimuli pro- ceeding from his group companions. But what about his mind ? Is the content different, and the mode of awareness the same ? Or are both different ? It is often assumed that he is conscious in a ,different way from the way in which we are conscious. This may be true, but I suspect that it is too easily assumed, and I am not clear as to what is meant by a different way of being conscious. Mr. Heard's language on this point will be seen to be obscure in -the extreme. He has introduced those sad words 'subjective ' and 'objective'. When man becomes individualised his mind is split into a subjective part and an objective part, self-consciousness is associated with the objective part, and happiness can only be restored if we learn to eliminate " the threshold between the objective and subjective minds ". As far as can be made out what he calls the ' objective mind' is what we usually think of as consciousness, and the subjective mind is the ' unconscious '; but we shall find tha,t there is a kind of subjective awareness historically beyond the split. Let us for a moment put aside the question of consciousness, and consider Mr. Heard's theory as a behaviouristic scheme which helps us to interpret the social relations of human beings. There are now two problems to consider. Under what conditions has this</page><page sequence="3">220 CRITICAL NOTICES: self-regarding, self-interested behaviour come about, and what has happened to the social side of our natures which self-seeking does haot satisfy ? ' The Social Basis of Religion ' is an attempt to answer these two questions. The former is dealt with in Part I, but in order to understand what Mr. Heard says one must appreciate his general attitude towards civilisation. In company with many other modern writers. he thinks there is something wrong, and his book is not merely a scientific enquiry but it is meant to be of practical value as well. He takes the familiar view that man's environment, particularly his institutional environment, is a projection of his nature. Things are what they are because man is what he is, therefore if things are wrong there must be something wrong with man. "The achieve- mnent and tragedy of civilisation . . . are due to .a fissure and specialisation in consciousness," he says on page 30. In his earlier book he put our troubles down to individualism and in Part I of this book he asks how individualisation came about. Dr. Freud traces our troubles back to a primal CEdipus situation in which the male children actually killed the father; and according to him the brand of patricide tortures the souls of all who come after. In a more recent work Freud has also suggested that there is another cause of distress-the 'Aggressions-trieb '; so that when Mr. Heard implies that Freud's theory is a sexual one through and through he is forgetting the other component of ' Das Unbehagen in der Kultur' In any case Dr. Malinowski in his Sex and Repression in Savage Society shows that there are matrilineal societies which are free from Gidipus troubles altogether. We must therefore, says Mr. Heard, look beyond patriarchic cedipoid society to an earlier regime. He suggests that at the very beginning the stage is set for an initernal conflict. There are two pulls, the pull of the family and the pull of the group, and the group is co-eval with the familv and does nof develop out of it. " Below the patriarchal society," he writes, " we should therefore expect to find as the next step away from complete individuality, the matriarchy, a social system-with, lower conflict-pressure, therefore less sense of individuality and lower energy discharge. . . . Lowest must lie a state of unselfconsciousness and a completely diffused authority through a direct unreflective sense of the community. This state is so firm, lacks so completelv the critical selfconscious- ness which is individuality, that it is only possible to suppose that it broke up into the more differentiated forms . . . through the tension created by two competing social patterns in the same field of constituents " (p. 39). From this quotation we can see that Mr. Heard's use of the word 'selfconsciousness ' is a little difficult to understand. Is he referring to a mode of awareness, or to a mode of behaviour ? Are the members, of the group at the lowest stage conscious of trees, paths and other humans, but not conscious of being conscious of them ? Or does</page><page sequence="4">GERALD HEARD, The Social Substance of Religion. 221 he simply mean that their behaviour is determined wholly by the needs of the groups and not by the needs of the individuals as such ? Are there any grounds for identifying self-consciousness with self- interestedness ? I should have thought that they might be conscious of a feeling such as might be expressed in the words 'I must go and fight', conscious, that is to say, that the feeling is in themselves and not in anyone else, without perhaps reflecting very much about it, and still one could say that their behaviour was dominated by the requirements of the tribe. We are up against the old danger of confusing phenomenology with oetiology. Let us go on with Mr. Heard's thesis.. He says that the pull of the family and the pull of the group, both co-eval in their influence on man's behaviour, lead first to the extension to the, group of the most significant feature of the family, to a kind of compromise. This is the meaning of matriarchy, the most primitive form of organised group. But something has happened which has started a development. The family and the group sometimes pull different ways and individuality is the result. The matriarchate is strong, satisfying and stable, but individualism, a state in which (i) my actions are to be interpreted as due to a certain amount of self- seeking, and (ii) I think of myself as being distinct from my fellow group-constituents, and having rights as valid as theirs, has set in. This development continues on its own and leads to the patriarchate, "c a reorganisation of society on a more flexible, mobile, adventurous and violent model " (p. 35). The father ousts the mother, but the new compromise still bears the mark of the family-the king is the father of his people. But a part of man is not satisfied. The groups grow too large, the preparedness to respond is there but the pull is too slight, the bonds too tenuous. The growth of individualism has led to a situ- ation inside us which makes us incapable of satisfactory projection. After all, the environment plays its part in providing most of the material on to which we ' project' otur organisations and institutions, and if we are to live in harmony with our environment it must be that what is outside us harmonises with what is inside. If we have a social nature which demands satisfaction, and if sheer procreation and individual dominance increase the numbers and hold them together, then it is possible that however we may 'project ' our 'social natures in the form of concepts like ' the clan', ' the tribe ' or ' the nation ', the referents of such words will be too scattered and multitudinous to satisfy us. We must seek some other way out. In Part II this other way out is investigated. In Les Formes e1,ementales de la Vie Religieuse Prof. Durkheim has suggested that the ceremony is the centre of religion, and that theology is the linguistic by means of which we rationalise the satis- factions which we experience at the community services, whether we eat the totem animal in the flesh or in the wafer; and Mr. Heard</page><page sequence="5">222 CRITICAL NOTICES: points out that these rationalisations are individualistic in tone. For Mr. Heard the eating at the religious ceremony has not the mean- ing that it has for Freud or Frazer. It is not the symbolic eating of a slaughtered father, which combines father-hatred with a primitive means of satisfying it, nor is it a magic identification by absorption: it is derived from the satisfaction of hunger pure and simple, though later on it gains a significance which is neither pure nor simple. The earliest ceremonies are the meetings of the group for the satisfaction of their need for food. "When one member was striving to attain food . . . sympathetic urgenev was expressed by all the others who looked on " (p. 84). Here we have the birth of ritual, while the wails of the lonely chimpanzee longing to re-merge himself in the group are the first utterances of prayer. And the passions and delights of primate communion developed into the joys of the proto-human circle as they " thrilled, gesticulated, grunted and hopped, while the leaders effected some common purpose " (p. 89). But these meetings, occurring as they did in the practical life of the herd, had another incidental value. They satisfied the social nature of its members because of the closeness of intercourse and unity of aim. And long after, the descendants of thea pes meet, not now to satisfy their hunger, though that mark of their original crowding is still there, but rather to emphasise their groupness. The practice becomes less and less practical and rationalisation quiets the reason with magic explanations of the rites; they make the crops grow and the game plentiful. Here we have the double nature of man, passionate and rational; the real value is emotional, but a reason must be given. The theology and mythology that accrete round these meetings, God the Father, the heavenly Mother, and the Slain Son, are all reflections of internal conditions. The family linguistic still echoes the primitive family interests; the mother still finds a place among the inhabitants of Heaven, and patriarchy still supplies a theological terminology. The loneliness of the sinner, his desire for one-ness with God, his horror, at the same time, of loosing his identity in death, are all of them symptoms of the conflict within between his social nature and his individualism. I believe this to be along the right lines. At our stage of psycho- logical knowledge we realise the unimportance of theological reasoning as a determinant of belief. We have grown out of the superficial stage at which we dismiss religion because it is silly; and we realise that the sillier it is, the more interesting, because it must satisfy some curious demand of human nature more fundamental than the search for truth. Now one of the most striking features of religion is the sexual component, and Mr. Heard has to deal with it. He is prepared to admit that once patriarchy is established, and a patriarchic formula- tion current in theology, we shall find the sexual complications of</page><page sequence="6">GERALD HEARD, The Social Substance of Religion. 223 mankind modifying the situation, but according to him " sex in religion is secondary to food " (p. 106). To begin with, he says that we should not expect sex to be the repressed energy from which the forces of religion are derived, because in primitive communities and among the higher apes sex is a trivial matter. In any case, if religion is a group matter, food-getting is a more social performance than copulation, which " can only be a question of exclusive coup- ling ". On page 133 he seems to contradict this view when he writes that "in a way that eating cannot be, sex is the function in which every constituent, however keenly he may feel enjoyment, is made part of the race ". The contradiction may possibly be resolved if we interpret the lonely sexualitv as that kind which knows what it is aboiit, while the social sexualitv doesn't because it is a purely biological group concern. But is this really the case ? How, then, did sex creep into religion at all ? " Increase self- consciousness, intensify individuality, and sex is not banished: there is only caused a concentration on its culminating moment. In the cycle of reproduction the reproductive act becomes the whole interest of man " (p. 133). There is, then, a very exciting experience, and it cannot be kept out; it colours whatever is of interest to man, simply because he is so occupied with it. And, moreover, "when sex becomes self-conscious it is bound to become sanctified " (p. 112). Besides this way in which sex comes into the religious field, because of its importance, there is another way: the very obvious factor of fecundity. " The idea of the mother is the bridge from food to procreationalism " (p. 122), and when the tribe weakened,. and morality was loosened, "fertility religion became more specifi- cally erotic " (p. 127). But whence ' morality' 2 "We must presume . that as the first stage of the personalising of the group's moral sense, the matriarchy and the mother worship, arose, the incessant effer- vescence of sex would be suppressed and denied its simmering discharge " (p. 113). But why ? Surely this points to some kind of incest ban, or some other basis of repression which calls for explanation. As individualisation grows apace and anthropomorphism sets in with its personalised gods, these individualisations of man's group- vearning only serve to madden him, because they are the mirrorings of his individuality which cannot satifsy his social nature; they are, as it were, usurpers. The energy comes from unsatisfied herdism, but the creations are in individualistic shape. There seems to be here an interesting modification of the usual line of argument con- cerning svmptomatic projections. The symptom is usually sup- posed to ' drain off ' repressed energy by virtue of its hidden meaning,, while its manifest and rationalised meaning satisfies the repressing forces, but is irrelevant to the repressed ones. Here, however, the manifest content of the symptom, and especially its individualistie quality, seems to be a bar to the finding of satisfaction through the-</page><page sequence="7">224 CRITICAL NOTICES: hidden meaning. That is to say, though God may stand for the group, the fact that he is disguised as a personal being makes it harder for the repressed social desires to find satisfaction in His ' real ' nature. The projection has reacted on to the repressed forces which caused it. According to psycho-analytic theory the symptom does not provide complete satisfaction (1) because what satisfaction it does provide is merely symbolic instead of being direct, and (2) because the patient feels guilty in having any satis- faction whatever, however meagre, and not because of the overt nature of the symptom at all, because the Unconscious is clever ,enough to make anything stand for anything when it comes to double meanings. I doubt whether there is any independent evidence for Mr. Heard's kind of projection, a symptom which is such that repressed desires caninot read its 'true ' meaning and find a faint satisfaction in it. We come now to the split in religious development. On the one hand we have the ascetic rejecting life " because of the antagonism he as an individual feels between himself and the life-force ", and on the other the erotic trying " to drown his sense of self . . . in repeated plunges into the most violent vortex of the race stream ", and we are also told (p. 166) that " eroticism generally reacts into asceticism " and even that " the ascetic is inevitable if the individual is left unsolved " (p. 190). We have already seen that sex starts at a disadvantage because of an unexplained restriction under matriarchy, but there seems to be a further reason. Sex gets a bad name because it is focussed on to pbysical pleasure, and for some reason or other Mr. Heard seems to think that that is bound to lead to a reaction. The practices of erotics "because they are the expression of increasing individuality, and that causes the emphasis to be placed on individual physical sensation, cannot give general psychic relief " (p. 149). Procreation is safe, the animals procreate with impunity, and may even enjoy it, but when the pleasure of procreation is focussed on to the pleasure of the procreative act, then its pleasure will turn to pain, and dreariness. This is a verv dubious argument indeed. Usually the sheer physical energies of the body control desire in that direction, and there are enormous numbers of people who indulge in sexual pleasure without remorse. Surely where there is remorse and disapproval it must be because sexual pleasures are connected with some hidden anid forbidden desire, and symbolise it to the minds of those who have strong feelings against them. That type of ex- planation seems the only possible. one where disapproval obviously goes beyond, reason. Freud, of course, has his (Edipus theory, which is at least more plausible than Mr. Heard's; though if it is true that there is repression in matriarchates which is of a non-aedipus nature, we must,look in such cases for some other cause. The problem of the rise of asceticism presents enormotus difficulties. Mr. Heard's general line is that the ihdividual "takes against" life</page><page sequence="8">GERALD. HEARD, The Social Substance of Religion. 225 simply because he does not realise that it is due to his own pectliar construction thaNt life does not satisfy him. But surely this is a case for 'indiflerence, lack of interest, but not for passionate dis- approval. There are pleasures which one does not seek because they do not satisfy any part' of one's make-up, but one does not necessarily persecute those who indulge in them. Asceticism is a more violent, positive, bitter attitude than boredom, and there must be some imaginary or real punishment, which ascetics fear, to make them turn on temptation as they do. But, in spite of " fatal fissiparity ", there have been brief moments when man has been blessed with some rare kind of joy and satis- faction, or rather when a few gathered together have experienced a thrill which is denied to the majority of mankind to-day. In the early years of the Christian era meetings, love feasts, were held; and these meetings, large enough to submerge the individual, and small enough to have the necessary pull over hiln, provided a milieu where he could get 'recharged' with energy because it satisfied that group-desire which ordinary society, economically and not psycho-socially built, fails to appease. Metaphor is necessarily the language of psychology because we must apply a spatial linguistic to a non-spatial field, buttit is dangerous. What exactly is meant by this ' re6harging ' is obscure. It seems a way of' saying that the members 'of the early communities found a joy in their agapes which was due to the relaxation of the tension between their individualised and their suppressed social natures. This lasted but a short time. The groups grew too big, organi- sation stepped in, Paul wrote the Epistles and asceticism surged back, forbidding all but the most spiritual and sublimated love, and the whole point of the gatherings was misunderstood. If only we could group ourselves into such communities now, we should find in the beloved community " a path that widens infinitely to the reunion of all life and the whole universe " (p. 210). But how is this to come about? We must remember that the question of number is a vital one, and, more important than that, we must pay attention to Mr. Heard's attitude to reason. Reason is essentially an individualistic performance, and if reason tells us that a certain course of.action is what we need, we must immediately be on our guard. What matters is a change of heart and not a change - of head. If our social natures burst through, or if, as Mr. Heard hinted in his other book, the individual side of our natures grows less predominant, then no doubt we may begin to coagulate into groups like the early Christians, but no decision on the matter will cut any ice at all, unless it is backed up with the requisite internal constitution. Most, of us would admit that ' self-less ' people are often happier than selfish ones, that people who harp on the question 'what do I get out of it ? ' are often unhappy, and that it would be very nice if people were less self-seeking than they are; but not all of us 15</page><page sequence="9">226 CRITICAL NOTICES: welcome Mr. Heard's suggestion that we should seek the submergence of our individuality, whether for an hour or for life, even supposing we had much say in the matter. I To sum up; Mr. Heard has called our attention to a very im- portant aspect of man's constitution-his social nature, and he has shown that that side of him has played a very large part in the development of religious practices. There are, however, t-wvo un- satisfactory features in the book; his treatment of consciousness, which I do not feel he need have discussed at all, and his treatment of the connection between sex and religion. We shall not have a satisfactory psychology of religion until we have a satisfactory account of asceticism, and this Mr. Heard has certainly not given us. This is another of those useful books written by a man full of ideas and suggestions, who, as it were, cannot see the trees for the wood. It is like a picture painted from the air from a peculiar angle; we may say that the detail is wrong, and certain relations unlike reality, but more often than not, as in this case, we are enormously helped by a connected view of so large a tract of country at once. Mr. Heard's powers of grouping and packing his great historical knowledge are well known. The chapters on the develop-, ment of' Judaism, Greek and Roman religion, and the rise of Christianity are brilliant. Many people will find his language difficult: he writes in a complicated parenthetic style, but when he is making unusual connections and unexpected interpretations the compactness of the actual writing may be a positive advantage, and I recommend all who -are interested in the psychology of religion to make the effort to overcome the initial feeling of unfamiliarity.
