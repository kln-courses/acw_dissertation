<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historicizing Strong Metaphors A Challenge for Conceptual History RIEKE SCHAFER Universität Hamburg, Institut für Politikwissenschaft ABSTRACT The debate between metaphor theorists and conceptual historians has been intensifying in recent years. This article takes this debate beyond the bias toward Blumenbergs metaphorology, and starts from the interaction view of metaphor as formulated by Max Black. The article opens with a theoreti cal framework that reformulates Blacks notions of metaphorical resonance and emphasis. It adapts them to the requirements of Conceptual History, and adds a third, historical criterion for metaphoricity. It then applies these sug gestions to the history of the metaphor play/game/'Spiel/jeu within twentieth century political thought. Here, the focus lies on the role this metaphor plays in the conceptual relations between the ideas of political order, conflict, and immanence.1 KEYWORDS Max Black, conceptual history, metaphor theory, play/game/Spiel/jeu, politi cal thinking Since truth has become a "mobile army of metaphors,"2 and human language an "ancient city," "a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods,"3 understanding continu ity and change in meaning has become a terrain for scholarly exercise, and a difficult terrain indeed. This article joins in the combined efforts of conceptual historians and metaphor theorists to understand the role that the use of figura tive language plays in conceptual change.

The broader context of this example is a long-standing tradition, within the history of political ideas, to found political order on some transcendental instance—be it a divine authority, the grip of myth, human reason, or the telos of history. During the twentieth century, political thinkers of different intel lectual strands and traditions express their doubts toward such a transcenden tal foundation.4 They seek to provide accounts of processes in which political order and obligation are immanently constituted. The notion of conflict be comes central for the conception of such processes. The conceptual relations between order, immanence, and conflict are not tied solely through the work of logical reasoning, but modeled and transformed within a metaphorical inter action with the concepts of play and game. This finding points to two blind spots that conceptual history risks to per petuate if it continues to renounce the challenges of figurative language. First, certain sections of conceptual nets will remain invisible, unless and until they are articulated in the linguistic modes that conceptual history methodology can investigate. Consider for instance the history of the political concept of contingency: many conceptual patterns that political philosophy attributes to the concept of contingency also occur in places and times where the term con tingency does not appear. I demonstrate how the analysis of the ludic metaphor can bring to the fore some of these occurrences. The second point is even more important. Cut off from metaphor his tory, conceptual history remains restricted to the history of a very specific type of conceptual relations. Studying figurative language may provide an under standing of a completely different type of relations that integrates conceptual nets. Metaphor history can also shed new light on conceptual histories that have already been written. But is metaphor theory well prepared for this undertaking? The dialogue between metaphor theory and conceptual history has been intensified in recent years.5 In order for it to fulfill its promise, the main task remains to address the 4.

It means, first, to assess the cognitive or thought-guiding force of a metaphor with reference to the histori cal context of its utterance. Contextualizing metaphors, as a consequence, also makes the interpreter sensitive to different degrees of metaphorical force—not every metaphor is absolute or strong, but even weaker metaphors can fulfill some cognitive function. Second, historicizing strong metaphors means to give an account of why and how the thought-guiding force of metaphors increases or decreases over time. This article proceeds in three steps: The first part suggests several meth odological principles that may enhance a historical understanding of strong metaphors. The second part illustrates these methodological reflections by tracing the changing role of the metaphors of play and game in twentieth cen tury political thinking. Finally, it draws some general conclusions about the role of metaphors in conceptual change. Toward a Historical Understanding of Strong Metaphors Today, the general interest in metaphor theory for conceptual history is widely acknowledged.7 The task now is to translate this theoretical premise into a more detailed research agenda. For this purpose, the dialogue between con ceptual historians and metaphor theorists needs to overcome its bias toward Blumenbergs inspiring and demanding heritage.8 In fact, the discussion so far has mainly centered on the reintegration of "absolute metaphors"9 or instances of non-conceptuality10 into the scope of historical semantics. However, relat ing metaphor theory and historical semantics to each other becomes more Beck Lassen, "'Metaphorically Speaking'—Begriffsgeschichte and Hans Blumenbergs Meta phorologie," in Eine Typologie der Formen der Begriffsgeschichte, Riccardo Pozzo and Marco Sgarbi, eds., Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte, Sonderheft 7 (Hamburg: Meiner, 2010), 53-70; Matthias Kroß and Rüdiger Zill, eds., Metapherngeschichten: Perspektiven einer Theorie der Unbegrifflichkeit [Metaphor histories: perspectives on a theory of non-conceptuality] (Ber lin: Parerga, 2011). 6.

In effect, the following reflections take up a suggestion that has become increasingly audible in recent scholarship,11 and is anchored in the interaction view of metaphor, as developed by Ivor Armstrong Richards, Max Black, and Paul Ricœur.12 My use of the concept of metaphor designates a mode of utterance. A met aphorical utterance relates two concepts from different semantic fields, such as city and language in the quote from Wittgenstein, which opened this article. As a consequence, the actual meaning of the utterance diverges from the lit eral meaning of the words that it is built of.13 In order to explain how mean ing emerges from that moment of rupture, Max Black introduces the notion of the "implicative complex." It designates a "set of 'associated implications'" which emerges from "current opinions shared by members of a certain speech community."14 To stay with Wittgensteins "ancient city," the term might have evoked the associations of disorder, but also of familiarity. The meaning of the metaphorical utterance is made up of an interaction between the implicative complex of the nonconventionally used concept, the focus of the metaphor (here city), and the implicative complex of the metaphors frame (here lan guage). The isomorphic aspects of both systems of semantic relations initiate conceptual projections from the focus to the frame.15 These projections create a relationship between the focus and the frame that is subservient to a distinct modality: They relate two concepts to each other in the form of an analogy; and furthermore, working purely on the level of ideation, they assume this analogy to be an analogy in the realm of thought, not an analogy in the realm of reality.16 A metaphor is an utterance whose mode is best described as an analogy in thought. Max Black distinguishes two criteria that help to specify the character of a metaphorical utterance. On the one hand, some foci can have more extensive systems of implications than others, thereby allowing for a "high degree of implicative elaboration."17 That is to say, they have a higher metaphorical reso nance. On the other hand, metaphorical projections have a different degree 11. See, for example, different contributions in Kross and Zill, Metapherngeschichten, 24, 96,110. 12. Ivor A.

Whereas some meanings can be equally expressed in a literal paraphrase, other metaphorical utterances lack the possibility of a literal trans lation. These are called emphatic metaphors.18 Combining these two criteria, the interaction view of metaphor distinguishes between strong metaphors that are both emphatic and resonant, and weak metaphors that lack at least one of these two features, and that have more of an ornamental quality.19 The appeal of this approach at this stage of discussion is twofold. On the one hand, it may differentiate between various forms and degrees of thought guiding force.20 On the other hand, it can move the discussion from a mainly theoretical discussion to its mise en pratique, as it allows at least in a syn chronic or micro-diachronic perspective to distinguish "conventional" from "metaphorical" language use.21 Even though there may be a genuine metapho ricity of all language, a concept of metaphor that lends itself to interpretative application needs to draw that distinction. Nevertheless, from the historians perspective, the interaction view, due to its roots in analytical philosophy, is still too abstractly and generally formulated to be a guide through the depths of contextual interpretation. I therefore suggest a reformulation of Max Blacks account of thought-guiding metaphors in a language that is better suited to historical semantics. This reformulation refines and spells out Blacks catego ries of metaphorical resonance and emphasis, and supplies an additional, gen uinely historical criterion. This supplement also strengthens the interaction view with regard to important criticisms that it has received. Metaphorical Resonance Revisited Black stresses that the metaphorical interaction is not so much between "things," but between "systems," or more precisely "systems of relationships."22 This relational perspective needs to be deepened in two steps. To begin with, an analysis of the resonance of a metaphorical utterance should not only question which elements of the focus's implicative complex are projected to the frame; it has to describe, in addition, how the relations within the system of implications are constituted. Are they for instance built according to the rules of logical discourse? Or do they obey a grammar gradu ally formed by custom or tradition? Refining Blacks theory, I suggest that the projections from focus to frame not only involve single points of an implica tive complex, but may also apply to the genre of relation that reigns inside. Discursive genres, in general, link and organize utterances of different modes. 18. Ibid., 439. 19. Ibid., 440. 20. "Resonance and emphasis are matters of degree." Ibid., 440. 21.

Working throughout with elementary examples ("Mar riage is a zero-sum game"; "Poverty is a crime"; "Love is a rose"), Black seems to assume that the metaphorical interaction invests in two implicative com plexes only—one belonging to the frame, and one belonging to the focus. As the examples later in the article show, a large number of metaphorical foci simultaneously evoke more than one implicative complex, springing from dif ferent discursive genres. (Imagine overlapping semantic nets, whose connect ing lines differ in color and design.) To some degree, the interaction that a metaphor initiates always springs from the basic web of implications that emerges from everyday use.24 One of the implicative complexes that metaphor historians need to take into account is thus the one formed importantly by the mode of custom within a discursive genre that may be called, for lack of a better name, "colloquial." The most sa lient shortcoming of metaphor history has been the underestimating of this characteristic in its methodological implications. Interpreters tend to nourish their analysis implicitly by the ad hoc understandings based on the common sense of the present rather than the common sense understanding from the time or linguistic space under investigation.25 Even though the commonplace associations mediated by everyday language always escape methodological rigor to some extent, there are procedures that at least allow the interpreter to step back from his pre-understandings. The second part of this article, for instance, uses contemporary dictionaries for this purpose. Although contextualization in the colloquial language is essential, it may not be sufficient. How could a metaphor of implicative abundance achieve the kind of original insights that strong, lively or absolute metaphors have been praised for if they simply show an object in a different, but still completely familiar, light?26 For the most part, strong metaphors are strong by virtue of augmenting the familiar everyday meanings with implications that they im plicitly or overtly take from other, narrower discursive genres. Such genres 23. See, for instance, the conception of genre de discours in Jean-François Lyotard, Le différend [The différend] (Paris: Les Éditions de Minuit, 1983), 187. 24. On this point, I agree with Donald Davidson's stress on the importance of "original meanings." See his, "What Metaphors Mean," Critical Inquiry 5, no. 1 (1978): 34. 25. An example can be found in the otherwise very informative metaphor history of Reise by Christine Schildknecht, "Die Metapher der Reise: 'Streifzüge der Phantasie' oder philosophische Methode?" [The metaphor of journey: "Forays of fantasy" or philosophical method?], in Metapherngeschichten, 197-208 (see note 4). 26. A similar objection is formulated by Ricœur, La métaphore vive, 114-116. winter 2012 33</page><page sequence="7">Rieke Schäfer can consist of intellectual paradigms or the architecture of thought of a single author, in the language of a specific scientific discipline, the thought behavior of an artistic movement or a political ideology. It can also consist of the lin guistic patterns that individual languages with their grammar, their peculiar vocabulary and their idioms form. It is important to note that these different genres do not relate to each other in exteriority, but may overlap. This twofold deepening of the relational account of resonance that Black hints at may now allow for a reformulation: The "resonance" of a metaphor refers to the abundance within and between the focus's implicative system(s). Resonance increases to the degree that the genres evoked by a metaphors focus are a multiplication (in quantity) and a variation (in quality) in relation to the genre of the metaphors frame. As a consequence, the specific mode of a metaphorical utterance can further be specified: A metaphor is an analogy in thought, the meaning of which is coherently and distinctly open. It is open insofar as metaphors allow for simultaneous paraphrases in different genres; as these explications can each be distinctive, they do not yet lack coherence. To conclude this point, the first step towards a historical understanding of strong metaphors, that is an understanding with reference to their context of utterance, is the explication of the different simultaneous isomorphisms that nourish the metaphorical interaction. Metaphorical Emphasis Revisited On this basis, the interpreter can question the impact of the analogical work of the metaphor on the frames discursive genre and gain a refined understanding of what Black has called the emphasis of a metaphorical utterance. Metaphors are emphatic the moment they become a regular part of a discursive genre. In such a case, the openness of their analogical bond is no longer replaceable by the bonds of other modes of utterance. Some metaphori cal utterances not only lack any possibility of literal paraphrase because there are no concepts that could cover their openness to various interpretations,27 but also because any kind of conceptual relation other than the metaphorical one—the analogical and purely ideational one—would violate the openness of metaphors to entangle different kinds of conceptual relations. To historicize strong metaphors therefore also means to pay attention to the regularity of a metaphors occurrence. Metaphorical emphasis can manifest itself in a radicalized manner as well. The second part of this article considers an example in which the metaphorical mode has not only interposed itself in a discursive genre. Rather, the meta 27. A "semantic gap" is the most frequent reason that metaphor theorists give for a met aphor's emphasis; see for instance Searle, "Metaphor," 92-123. 34 contributions to the history of concepts</page><page sequence="8">Historicizing Strong Metaphors phorical mode of conceptual linkage has spread to the discursive genre in gen eral and has reshaped the design of its constituting relations. The metaphorical now becomes one of the attributes of the genre in general. A Third Criterion: Metaphor's Temporality In an essay on the role of metaphors for interdisciplinary knowledge trans fers, Eva Johach holds that by virtue of their implicative richness, metaphors retain the potential of reactivation even after their meaning is momentarily fixed within a specific discourse.28 This hypothesis opens a diachronic perspec tive that seems not only investment-worthy, but even necessary, if we want to understand why and how metaphorical force increases or decreases over time. For this purpose, I suggest enlarging Blacks account of strong metaphors by a genuinely historical criterion, which I call here the metaphors temporality. One of the characteristic features of every discursive genre is the tem poral constitution of its linkages. Some genres allow for prompt changes in meaning, others only change slowly over long periods of time. Some genres allow for the transfer of their meanings over large gaps in time, others re quire a constant reiteration for meaning to be continuous. A historical under standing of strong metaphors requires a profound account of the temporality of every single one of the genres involved in the metaphorical interaction.29 Metaphor s capacity to simultaneously evoke different genres also means that it can be temporally complex. It can both inscribe itself in the language use of the present and continue past patterns of use. I assume that it is precisely this temporal complexity that enables metaphorical utterances not only to open meaning, to capture the thinking, but to set it on unfamiliar, new, or original paths. Expanded in this manner, the interaction view therefore is also able to stand up to the most important criticisms that it has received from different sides. In their otherwise different discussions of Black, philosophers such as Donald Davidson, John Searle, and Paul Ricœur have questioned whether the interaction view is finally able to explain the emergence of novel or uncon 28.

Two questions can be helpful for this purpose. First, is the addressee of the genre specific or unspecific? This is important, as unspecific addressee positions decelerate con ceptual change. Second, are reflective utterances constitutive of the discursive genre, that is, utterances that describe the rules of the genre? Genres that lack this possibility of reflexivity can ensure continuity only through constant reiteration. Past meanings are lost. Genres that have reflexive moments that require, for instance, the definition of terms, can even be taken up much later. winter 2012 35</page><page sequence="9">Rieke Schäfer ventional meanings.30 Only the diachronic multiplication of meaningful con texts allows the continuation of familiar meanings and to create new meanings at the same time. So far I have highlighted three criteria that can explain shifting degrees of metaphorical force: the variance and multiplication of discursive genres in volved in the metaphorical interaction (resonance); the impact of the meta phorical mode of utterance within a discursive genre (emphasis); and the diachronic complexity of the discursive genres involved in a metaphorical interaction (temporality). The following pages will apply and illustrate this heuristic. The Ludic Constitution of Political Order The analysis of the game metaphor in the writings of an exemplary selection of authors—Rudolf Smend, Jean-François Lyotard, Bonnie Honig, and Chantai Mouffe—apply and illustrate the methodological claims put forward in this article. Beforehand, a few remarks are in order about the methodological im plications of my choice of sources. Since the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe found itself exposed to the reproach of "Gipfelwanderung,"31 the significance of single texts, and especially single texts from specific levels of discourse, has been of concern to historical se mantics. A dialogue with discourse theory as well as the technical possibilities opened by the digitization of relevant sources has enabled scholars to include a large number of texts into a study of conceptual change. Yet this possibility meets a systematic limitation in the writing of metaphor history. The iden tification of an utterance as metaphorical is already a complex hermeneuti cal undertaking. No utterance is per se metaphorical, conventional meanings develop their figurative force only in the framework of a concrete commu nicative situation. Metaphors are radically context-bound.32 The writing of metaphor history therefore requires particularly close attention to single texts. As a consequence, metaphor historians who wished to trace wider diachronic 30. See Davidson, "What Metaphors Mean," 38; Searle, "Metaphor," 100; Ricœur, La mé taphore vive, 114-116. 31.

In the past, this feature has allowed studies in metaphor history to languish below the standards set up for the study of con ceptual history. Metaphor history has, until now, often juxtaposed the use that a restricted number of writers have made of a specific metaphor. However, the extent to which these examples can illustrate wider thought behaviors or se mantic trends remains unexplored. It is not the restriction to the texts of single authors that poses a limitation to the wider significance of the findings of the interpreter. The radical contextuality of a metaphorical utterance also carries a promise for the aims of conceptual history. As understanding of a metaphor s meaning is above all sensing a semantic break, a historically sensitive interpre tation cannot do without systematic attention to wider horizons of meaning. If metaphor historians systematically lend their interpretations to the movement between the single communicative act and broader semantic trends, then a few exemplary metaphorical uses can be the lens through which broader de velopments will come to the fore. The challenge of a polyphonic contextualiza tion, that is a contextualization in different discursive genres has too long been neglected by metaphor history. The exemplary choice of a Staatsrechtslehrer (legal theorist) from the Weimar Republic, a French postmodern philosopher from the middle of the twentieth century, and two "agonist pluralists" from contemporary Anglophone discourse, therefore, now permit a response to that challenge. Rudolf Smend The vehement dispute about the nature of state and constitution among Ger man legal scholars of the Weimar Republic constitutes the immediate context of the political thinking of Rudolf Smend (1882-1975). Echoing the discourse of Geisteswissenschaften in vocabulary and tone, his major text "Verfassung und Verfassungsrecht" (Constitution and constitutional law) from 1928 aims at a conception of the unity of the state that would not reduce it to the purely formal consistency of positive constitutional norms. Smend's thinking aims at lending the state a more solid reality, without deriving it from a transcendent instance. It seeks to account for an immanent constitution of a substantive po litical order. The nodal point of Smend's answer to that challenge is his concept of integration. This concept designates the expressions of life, Lebensäußerun gen in which the state constitutes itself as a spiritual reality.33 Smend distin 33.

Reflecting on the role of conflict within parliamentary regimes, Smend describes this third type of "functional integration" with recourse to the metaphor of the game: In a healthy policy, the experience during such political combats is that of an agreeable venting of tensions, of a catharsis, similar to the outcome of a game. The reason for this agreeable, cathartic effect does not depend on the satisfac tion at a correct result or on the satisfaction at reaching and keeping formal unity: the combat is a fundamental and integrating sign of life of the com munity, and it therefore augments the awareness of life of every individual, whether it belongs to the majority or the minority.35 This metaphorical utterance projects five implicative relations of a game to a political conflict. Game and Pleasure. Relating the game to a particular intensity of life, an Erhöhung des Lebensgefühls, Smend s use associates political conflict with plea sure. This not only continues the patterns of Smend s contemporary everyday use,36 but also echoes the specialized psychological use made by Karl Groos, who stressed the recreational quality (Erholungswert) of the game.37 Game and Catharsis. In emphasizing cathartic venting, Groos' conceptual framework resonates as well. For this contemporary of Smend, the game was able to channel potentially violent drives into a harmless articulation.38 Brodocz and Gary S. Schaal, eds, (Opladen: UTB, 2002), 313-340. 34.

A further similarity between Smend's use of the concepts of political conflict and game is their oppositional relation to the notion of purpose,39 Whereas this conceptual relation is not of particular prominence in colloquial use, it continues a usage of the concept of game that became more frequent within humanities with the echo of Schillers aesthetics, and that Smend in particular encountered in Georg Simmel's reflections on the soci etal meaning of the game. In the beginning of the twentieth century Simmel had modeled his account of sociability on the concept of Spiel. His reflections started from the fundamental distance between the game and the purpose of real life, stressing at the same time the embeddedness of the uninterested ludic activity within the sphere of real life: "Every form of sociability is only a sym bol of life, as sketched in the flow of an exhilarating game. But it is yet a sym bol of life, whose image it transforms only as much as the acquired distance requires."40 Applying this relation between game, purposelessness, and life to political conflicts, Smend was able to think of functional integration within parliamen tarianism free from transcendent purposes. Criticizing the misleading, teleo logical implications of mechanistic political imaginaries, Smend unfolds an imaginary that responds to these defects. At the same time, the ludic metaphor lends coherence to a conception in which the game of political conflict gains an autonomous purposefulness. Game and Unity is the fourth implication that makes the game an appro priate metaphor focus for Smend's concept of functional integration. As has been shown in an etymological analysis by the linguist Jost Trier, Hegung (en closure) is at the very core of the concepts of play and game since antiquity.41 In this vein, Smend describes the way that the rules of the political contest strengthen the unity of a group.42 Game and Movement is the final aspect of the contemporary semantic context that makes the metaphor of the game fitting to Smend's dynamic ac count of the state. The game metaphor surely proves resonant in Smend's use. It combines the Weimarian genre of Staatsrechtslehre (constitutional law) with discursive genres 39.

My explication of these conceptual interactions has revealed different discursive genres, whose patterns shape Smend s use of the game meta phor: the contemporary everyday use of this concept, specific reflections in two contemporary neighboring disciplines, and a concurrent figurative paradigm, namely that of organic social imaginaries. The interactions with the colloquial language lend Smend's reflections the immediate intelligibility of habitualized meanings. Furthermore, the interactions with the psychological and sociological genre, carrying with them a differentiated, scholarly mode of reasoning, provide at the same time precision, a precision likely to articulate the relation of political order and immanence that Smend's conception of conflict embraces. Despite the resonance of Smend's game metaphor, it is not temporally complex. Both the colloquial and the specialized discourses occur in Smend's present. In their temporal concurrence, the metaphor may transport unfamil iar tones into the language of legal theory But it does not give rise to new and original meanings. Despite its resonance, the metaphor of the game does not become a stan dard element in Smend's constitutional theory. It occurs only in few further passages, and there with less resonance. The image does not take over the thought-guiding function that is appropriate for emphatic metaphors. In fact, in the context of Smend's writing and thinking, an alternative imaginary is still able to sustain the conceptual link between immanence and order: that is the organic metaphor, which Smend's texts make prominent in the notion of Leben (life). Smend uses the related thought patterns less in a biological tradi tion, which would make the state a makroanthropos, than in the tradition of hermeneutics and Lebensphilosophie. In the history of the metaphor of Leben, the early twentieth century is a time in which organic life has been reduced to one of its possible paradigms.43 In this framework, there is no semantic gap that might invite the resonant metaphor of the game to gain emphasis.44 Jean-François Lyotard: Political Language Cames Discours, figure, the doctoral dissertation of the French philosopher Jean François Lyotard (1924-1998), clearly takes the side of figurative language. 43.

But the bitter critique expressed by, for instance, Hans Kelsen, shows that this metaphor still opens itself to organicist understandings and has therefore already become problematic, see Hans Kelsen, Der Staat als Integration: Eine prinzipielle Auseinandersetzung [Fundamen tal objections to the integration theory of the state] (Vienna: Julius Springer, 1930), 26. 40 contributions to the history of concepts</page><page sequence="14">Historicizing Strong Metaphors Lyotards Nietzschean resistance to the clarity of concepts, in favor of the den sity of metaphors, must be understood as a means of politicizing his writing. The context of Lyotards involvement in the group Socialisme ou Barbarie (So cialism or Barbarism) explains this decision. Lyotards contributions on Al geria made him doubt that theory was able to contribute to the revolutionary project by describing the social and economic conditions in a clear and trans parent language. The "white terror of truth"45 of description seemed rather to have a paralyzing effect. The political potential of descriptive language, there fore, became dubious.46 Against this background, Discours, figure joins the broader Zeitgeist and advances a critique of the structuralist approach to language. According to Lyotard, a sign creates a seemingly homogenous realm of meaning, the "dis course," by externalizing the sensible. But the possible use of signs in a figura tive way returns the sensible into the interior of language, and thereby expands the signs from within. Even though Lyotard felt that Discours, figure had not yet convincingly put into action its own findings,47 both the notions of "dis course" and "figure" were already metaphors themselves.48 Indeed, from this point on language is Lyotards most important figure of the social and political realm of experience. The political was no longer necessarily made the referent of concepts, but was present in various metaphors, which are systematically in terlaced. Politics, often, is the silent outside, to which the figurative formations point. Here, the metaphorical mode has become a fundamental feature of the poststructuralist language itself. This lends a potential emphasis to every single metaphor. The following discusses the particular emphasis that the metaphor focus jew acquires during a specific period of Lyotard's writing.49 In 1979, Lyotard publishes two texts, very different in genesis and presen tation, which take up the question of the legitimacy of order. The famous Con dition postmoderne, commissioned by the Conseil des Universités of Québéc, inquires into the legitimacy of knowledge; and, Au juste, a series of conversa tions between Lyotard and Jean-Loup Thébaud, deals with the legitimacy of political judgments. Both place the notion of language-game at their center, taking up Ludwig Wittgensteins figure at the point where its description as 45.

Explicating these different implicative rela tions, I show how the metaphor of the language game not only resonates the conceptual architecture of Wittgensteins "Philosophical Investigations," but also evokes other genres, such as Nietzscheanism, specific disciplinary discourses within the social sciences, and, of course, the molds of everyday language. Polymorphism. Taking up the idea of family resemblance that Wittgen stein had elaborated on in the example of the concept of game, Lyotard's use of jeu presents language-games as multiple, unique, simultaneous, and irrec oncilable. He distinguishes manifold language-games of different categories, such as the language games of description, prescription, or interrogation, of teaching and research, or of speculative philosophy. Different unique language games can be played at the same time: "one can play simultaneously several games; in fact, this is nearly always the case."51 Still, no language-game can be translated into another: "because, if they were, they would not be language games. It is as if one wanted to translate the rules and strategies of chess in those of check ers."52 This feature is central to Lyotard in this period, because he attributes it to the absence of a common criterion of judgment that may permit the mediation of different language-games. Importantly, Lyotard's allusion to Wittgensteinian patterns of use weakens the already mentioned colloquial implications of the concept of game: namely the implication of enclosure. This helps to disentangle the thinking of order from a quest for unity and identity that Smend's use, for instance, still put forward. The analysis of the plural temporality of Lyotard's game metaphor will account for this variation. Immanence. Elaborating on the language-game of prescription, which, at that time, seemed of particular political relevance to Lyotard, he gives new form to the motive of immanence. We receive prescriptive sentences, the il faut, as transcendent voices, provided that it is an empty transcendence.53 "This is where I feel that I am indeed playing the game of the just."54 The radi cal immanence of Lyotard's previous writings on "Libidinal Economy,"55 thus 50.

The game releases the player from the purposefulness of real life; it has its end in itself. Yet its sphere only exists in relation to the rule of serious purposes that are outside of it. Both rationalities coexist, but there is no passage between them. We can be con scious of the mere existence of the outside, but not of its content. Thus, even though there may be manifestations of transcendence even in postmodernity, they can no longer answer the question of legitimacy. The justification of its rules is effectuated within the language-games. Regularity. In La Condition postmoderne and Au juste, Lyotard's attitude toward order is much less destructive and polemical than in his previous writ ings. Echoing Wittgenstein once more, both texts proclaim rules as constitu tive of language-games: "if there are no rules, there is no game."56 To be precise, rules do not precede the game. Both are cooriginal.57 By changing the rules, we enter into another game: "even an infinitesimal modification of one of the rules alters the nature of the game."58 Lyotard, simultaneous to some of his con temporaries within and beyond the poststructuralist genre,59 plays down the coercive and conservative traits of rules in favor of their performative quality. The possibility to change rules while playing lends the game a transformative potential.60 Again, the reiteration of specific ideational patterns has allowed weakening colloquial implications61 of the concept of game. Agonism. Whereas agonism was not a necessary feature of Wittgensteins account of language-games,62 Lyotard declares them to be essentially competi cal analysis of these texts, see Petra Gehring, Innen des Außen-Außen des Innen: Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard [The inside of the outside-the outside of the inside: Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard] (Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 1994). 56.

Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, §66. winter 2012 43</page><page sequence="17">Rieke Schäfer tive.63 By introducing the agon, Lyotards texts also open up to the idea of strat egy. He is perfectly aware of the fact that Wittgensteins "move in a language game" laid the emphasis on the contextual conditions of meaning, and thus precisely rejected intentionality. But Lyotard, here, evokes colloquial implica tions that resist the model of Wittgenstein. Particularly in the moments when he reflects on his own writing in the image of the language-game, it is associ ated with strategic action. For instance, he notices how the grammar of the verb "to play" furthers the idea of intentional action: "one is in a game, a game with rules, and I play with these rules in order to achieve some effects upon the one I am playing with."64 Lyotard "plays the game of theory": "The least of these statements [Lyotards own statements] must be understood as a move in a context; in this fashion, everything I may have written is always tactical."65 Besides, the philosopher also augments the metaphors resonance by referring the fundamental agonism of the game to sources that range from Heraclitus and Nietzsche to seminal works in game theory.66 Intensification. A final implication that both texts evoke, although with less emphasis than the preceding ones, is the joyful attitude of the player. The competitive nature of the game "does not necessarily mean that one plays in order to win. A move can be made for the sheer pleasure of its invention."67 This implication echoes the idea of intensification, central to the period of the "Libidinal Economy." In a faint resonance of French Nietzscheanism,68 and drawing on vernacular understandings of the game, a certain Dionysiac pleasure is attributed to the multiplication of language games,69 a formula that becomes Lyotards imperative in the late 1970s. In this period of Lyotards writing,70 the language-game is a very resonant metaphor. It mediates a wide variety of discursive genres: it is a vehicle be tween commonplace meanings and a typically poststructuralist commitment to Wittgenstein, and combines faint Nietzschean echoes with the rational lan guage of game theory. Importantly, the language-game does not only multiply discursive genres in quantity; on a qualitative scale, it also expands the realm of possible interpretative explications. This qualitative, generic multiplication 63. Lyotard, La condition postmoderne, 23. 64. Lyotard and Thébaud, Just gaming, 54. 65. Ibid. 66. Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition, 88. 67. Ibid., 10. 68.

In his subsequent writings, Lyotard does not continue to use the game metaphor. The implications of intentional action and pleasure are the objects of an explicit reflection and clear sharp critique in Lyotard, Le différend, 89. 44 contributions to the history of concepts</page><page sequence="18">Historicizing Strong Metaphors manifests itself in the very different tones in which Lyotard articulates the metaphor. The reader encounters a sober and methodical use in the Condition postmoderne; and follows its dialogical and rhetorical blossom in Au juste. Note that the variety in modality corresponds to a temporal variety. In terlacing the contemporary colloquial language with the distant voice of Witt genstein, Lyotard weaves present with past meanings. While the immediate intelligibility of colloquial language relies on constant reiteration, the reflexive nature of Wittgensteins philosophical language is able to bridge larger tempo ral gaps. In the same manner, Lyotard interlaces an already fainting Nietzsche anism with the ascending paradigm of game theory. The metaphors complex temporality permits overwriting meanings within one discursive genre with even contrary meanings from others. For example, the Wittgensteinian stress on plurality and openness was able to replace the habitual associations of the game with enclosure and unity. The specific temporality that Lyotard s use of the game metaphor displays unfolds the creativity that lively and strong metaphors are appreciated for. Its thought-guiding function lies precisely in the forming of an ideational pattern that links conflict, immanence, and political order. We have already seen how within poststructuralism, the metaphorical mode becomes generally irreplaceable. In the absence of valid foundations, all ordering values, be it the anchor of "truth" in the world of the mind, or the grounding of legitimacy within the world of humans, are immanent values. Thinking and acting are exposed to contingency. The emphasis of the game metaphor lies in its capacity to verbalize this contingency in both content and form: its system of implications associates plurality, immanence, and proces suality. At the same time, the mode of the metaphorical expression, in its ana logical functioning and its introduction of openness, resists identity as well as foundational instances. Emphasis here does not only mean that the game metaphor has become irreplaceable for the forming of ideas, but also for their articulation. It has acquired a complementary pragmatic emphasis. The ges ture it allows for has become irreplaceable for the performative coherence of a philosophical articulation of contingency. Lyotards transposition of this metaphor to political philosophy is also the articulation of this thought practice within political thinking. Agonistic Pluralism The starting point of different authors, who have written during the past two decades under the label of "agonistic pluralism," is that there is a fundamental contingency of all foundations. Though the common label covers very dis similar approaches to politics, William Connolly, Bonnie Honig, James Tully, and Chantal Mouffe concur in their attempt to articulate an alternative voice in the contemporary debate between the dominant liberal and communitar winter 2012 45</page><page sequence="19">Rieke Schäfer ian paradigms in democratic theory.71 According to the so-called agonists, both liberalisms trust in the ordering promise of reason and the communitar ians' reliance on the anchoring force of cultural contexts neglect the burden of contingency. They aim at an understanding of a democratic political order that renounces final instances of justification and makes continuous conflict its guiding principle. Yet, as I show by example for Honig and Mouffe, their "agonisms" close the meaning of the figure of the game and subtly decontest the thesis of contingency. Decontestation, a term that has been coined by Mi chael Freeden,72 is used here to point to those moves that reduce the contested character of political concepts. The political thinker Bonnie Honig converts the ludic metaphor into an image, which manifests itself less in metaphorical interactions at the surface level of the texts, and organizes conceptual relations rather in the background.73 The image of the agon provides the linkage between four aspects of Honigs political thought. First, it sustains a nonlinear conception of time that places (ludic) order and (agonistic) action in a simultaneous relationship. It "pos tulates the perspective of the present moment, that of the actor and not the spectator."74 Second, it is linked to the concept of contest, the contest between persons—an "agonistic contention as a generative resource for politics"75—as well as the contest within the multiple identity of the self, which is "itself the site of an agonistic struggle."76 Third, it furthers a positive notion of order, an order in permanent flux.77 Relating Nietzsche's and Arendts accounts of contest in ancient Greece and during the American Revolution, respectively,78 71.

Finally, both colloquial and Nietzschean implications of the image of the game carry an anthropology of abundance as the following quote expresses: "agonistic humanism is not centered on mortality and suf fering; it draws as well on natality and pleasure, power not just powerlessness, desire not just principle."80 On the level of the associated concepts, Honigs use of the game as a back ground image reiterates important parts of the pattern that my interpretation has worked out for Lyotard. There is, however, an important shift: unlike the coherent openness of an active metaphor, the thought-guidance of Honigs agon moves within the realms of a harmonious, ordered whole, an idea that precedes and closes the text. While the game is still emphatic for the forming of ideas, it is not essential to their articulation. That is, it has lost its pragmatic emphasis. This introduces a tension between Honigs stress on contingency, and the rescuing aesthetic wholeness that her texts eventually achieve. Chantal MoufFe's use of the agon increases this tension. Her "agonist" writings superimpose different layers of meaning. Each layer does not aug ment, but, like a palimpsest, erases the other. In the "Democratic Paradox,"81 she acknowledges that her "aim ... is at the same time political and theoreti cal."82 This popular text can in fact be regarded as a political pamphlet, whose plain language resonates, at least to some degree, with contemporary political language and is therefore accessible to a broader audience. A reader familiar with her prior collaboration with Ernesto Laclau,83 however, discovers a differ that, united, have the power to maintain and preserve it. Here he espouses not a radical subjectivism but a commitment to the responsible maintenance of a public, shared space of appearances for the sake of the contest it enables and secures. This agonism is not un restricted. Nietzsche endorses the ancient Greek practice of ostracism to protect the agon from domination by a single 'individual who towers above the rest.' For him, ostracism evi dences not an intolerance of excellence but a commitment to its (re)production. By preserv ing the agon, ostracism secured a structured opportunity for individuals to test themselves and develop their own distinctive excellences."

Its presumably unsophisticated sentences are also a sophisticated translation of poststructuralist and post-Marxist claims into the register of mainstream social sciences. Mouffe's usage of the concept of agon performs a closure of meaning on both levels. The Politics of Agonistic Democracy For the broader audience, the agon is a metaphorical leitmotif. The com monplace associations of the game can articulate some of the key concepts of Mouffe and Laclau's social theory in simple, colloquial terms. Agonism. The idea that the rules of a game are constituted within the game itself can translate some of the central implications of Laclau and Mouffe's concept of antagonism. Their discourse-theoretical formalization had freed this socialist concept of its economic determination, and overcome the binar ity and the provisional nature of antagonism. In order to carry this demand ing conceptual move beyond the narrow socialist register, Mouffe takes up Schmitts distinction between a belligerent enemy, Feind, and an agonistic ad versary, Gegner, and positions herself on the side of the agon: Once we accept the necessity of the political and the impossibility of a world without antagonism, what needs to be envisaged is how it is possible under those conditions to create or maintain a pluralistic democratic order. Such an order is based on a distinction between "enemy" and "adversary." It requires that, within the context of the political community, the opponent should be considered not as an enemy to be destroyed, but as an adversary whose exis tence is legitimate and must be tolerated. We will fight against his ideas, but we will not question his right to defend them. The category of the "enemy" does not disappear but is displaced; it remains pertinent with regard to those who do not accept the democratic "rules of the game" and who thereby ex clude themselves from the political community.84 Equality. Mouffe's dichotomy between the irreconcilable enemy and the agonistic adversaries, which meet on equal footing, echoes insights that she and Laclau had previously formulated with the concept of equivalence. The relation of equivalence that the "Democratic Revolution"85 and its fight for equality had instituted in the social realm is reinvented and perpetuated in Mouffe's account of agonistic democracy. The colloquial resonance of the game metaphor renders immediately convincing the postulate that "agonism is a we/ they relation where the conflicting parties, although acknowledging that there 84.

The commonplace idea of the game also carries simplifications that violate the prior theory. The associated idea of the "player" allows identifying the acting instances of the agonistic struggle with full-blooded humans—an anthropomorphism quite foreign to the decomposition of the individual into "subject positions," as elaborated in "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy."87 In addition, it evokes a strong idea of intentional action, which is also at odds with the action account of the seminal collaboration with Laclau. Whereas on this textual level, the agoti is the site of metaphorical projec tions, its resonance is weak. As the conceptual interactions do not go beyond everyday language, the discursive genre of the focus does not vary from that of the frame. As a rhetorical device, MoufFe's ludic metaphor does not perform an opening of meaning, but a closure. The Political Theory of Agonistic Democracy With regard to MoufFe's political theory of agonistic democracy, the agon re mains associated with the implications of order and immanence. Here, Mouffe particularly claims the intellectual heritage of Derrida.88 Yet the transition from Derrida's "jeu, pensé comme l'absence du signifié transcendental"89 (play, thought as the absence of the transcendental signified) to MoufFe's agon not only constricts the ludic semantics to the game-paradigm, but above all re places the open, analogical bonds of the metaphorical genre with the definite and clear cut bonds of logical reasoning. Whereas the plural and open mean ingfulness of the metaphorical genre was once indispensable in order to do justice to the premise of contingency, the concept of the agon has lost this emphasis in MoufFe. In all of the so-called agonists' writings, a further means of decontesting the thesis of contingency is certainly the textual function of the term agonistic/ agonism itself. In fact, a systematic analysis reveals that throughout MoufFe's text, and increasingly in the more recent works oF Honig and Connolly, the words are most often used in order to designate their own theoretical stand 86.

Metaphors between Contestation and Decontestation This article has examined three occurrences of play and game semantics in twentieth century political thought. Though the cultural and temporal dis tance of the three examples does not allow recounting their succession in one historical narrative—a narrative of the rise and fall of a metaphor—their com bined analysis does allow for a historical assessment of their cognitive func tion.90 Against the background of the contextualization of the resonant, but non-emphatic metaphorical recourse to the game in the early twentieth cen tury, its resonant and emphatic occurrence in Lyotard exhibits a stimulation of the metaphor. A contextualized reading was able to spell out the specific shape of this cognitive role, and point to the conditions of the emergence of new and original meanings. The multiple temporalities at work in Lyotard's use of the game metaphor were able to make it an emphatic figure of plurality and radi cal openness. In this light, the investigation into the contemporary example of Agonistic pluralism gave a differentiated account of a remaining thought-guid ing force, which appeared at the same time as a closing of the metaphorical opening of meaning. What are the benefits of such an approach to conceptual history? By way of a conclusion, I illustrate its explanatory gain by juxtaposing it with an ap proach that has convincingly ventured a synthesis of the different paradigms of historical semantics. Michael Freedens morphological approach to political ideologies understands conceptual change as the interplay of contestation and decontestation of meaning.91 The focus thus lies on the shifting necessity that different connotations have for the meaning of a concept over time. Different degrees of necessity are attributed to three spheres that the relational web of meaning of a concept embraces: The core of a concept contains elements that are irreplaceable, although only in a synchronic perspective; the logical and cultural adjacency is constituted by necessary categories whose content is nev ertheless contingent, and the periphery consists of elements of ever more con tingent categories.92 The movement of different features of a concept within this relational configuration is shaped by the process of translation between different discursive genres. Freeden mainly distinguishes two. On the one hand, the academic language use associates concepts by logical relations. On 90. The problematic nature of the diachronic perspective in metaphor history is also ad dressed in the review by Theo Jung in this volume. 91. See in particular Freeden, Ideologies and Political Theory. 92. Ibid., 61-67. 50 contributions to the history of concepts</page><page sequence="24">Historicizing Strong Metaphors the other hand, the conceptual bonds that everyday language creates rely to a stronger extent on culturally mediated patterns. Freeden convincingly claims the mutual interdependence of the logical commandment of coherence and the cultural rule of indeterminacy.93 Yet the question of how exactly both are mediated, remains open. It is here that the insight into the coherent openness of metaphorical language, which makes it effective in both the academic and the language of praxis, may take our understanding of conceptual change one step farther. A metaphor history that systematically analyzes resonance, emphasis, and temporality of metaphorical utterances can show, first, how different discursive genres are translated into each other. Second, it may help to understand how these translations reorder conceptual hierarchies within specific genres and their "morphology," and how increasing generic variance may even introduce what can be called new elements into these conceptual patterns. Both these processes reinvest in the essentially contested character of concepts.94 But the analysis has also shown how metaphors can become the site of decontestation, if a comparative perspective makes the interpreter sensitive to decreasing de grees of metaphorical force. To conclude, as vehicles between different discursive levels, and organs of both contestation and decontestation, metaphors are one of many possible means that drive conceptual change. 93.
