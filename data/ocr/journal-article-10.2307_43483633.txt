By John Still.* Tantri-malai is the name now given to a wilderness of rocks situated about two miles west of the Malwatu-oya and about twenty miles due north-west of Anurádhapura. For many centuries the place has been abandoned, and although it was at one time an important monastery, with perhaps an adjacent town, at the present day its very name is lost Despite its situation in quite uninhabited country, and on the edge of one of the largest stretches of wild forest in the northern half of the Island, Tantri-malai has been frequently visited. A notice of it appears in Mr. Parker's recent book, "Ancient Ceylon" (pp. 244-5), and a fuller account in the Archseological Commissioner's Annual Report for 1896. f Mr. Bell, on his visit in October, 1896, encountered the stormy rainy weather which usually ushers in the north-east monsoon in that part of the country ; and of the other visitors , most, if not all, made but short stay at the rock. It, therefore, happens that I am able to record a certain amount that is new, for I spent a week there, living in a cave and devoting my whole time to exploration of the rocks. The rocks of Tantri-malai differ from those tumbled labyrinths the ancient Sinhalese most usually chose for their early monasteries. They are less a collection of boulders than a huge series of frozen waves of stone, separated one from another by narrow gullies full of jungle and tangle and thorns. Owing to this formation there are fewer caves than usual, and in consequence fewer inscriptions ; for the earliest inscrip- tions were generally cut on the brows of caves. Broadly speaking the rocks divide into two groups, with a sinuous stretch of grass land between them, which at its * Mr. Still served as Assistant to the Archaeological Commissioner from January 1, 1902, to December 31, 1907. - B., Ed.

At the time of my visit (December, 1909) this intervening grass land was a rather swampy meadow, the favourite haunt of wild buffaloes. But in the days when the monastery flourished it too must have been submerged by thè waters of the tank. With the large area of non-absorbent rock to collect and transmit the rain, it is probable that a very considerable population might have subsisted by means of this reservoir ; always supposing, of course, that no water was drawn off for irrigation purposes, and of this there is no indication in the way of either sluice or channel. In this dry land, and remote from the river, water conservance was of the first importance, and I am inclined to attribute an early date to this little reservoir. But the history of Tantri-malai goes back far beyond the tank - at least I think so - and it seems to me that in its various remains we can read of four different ages of occupa- tion, ending in tragic abandonment. It may be that in this I have tried to see too much in the stones and their record ; but the evidence, such as it is, forms the subject of this Paper, and those who cannot accept the conclusions may perhaps form others from the observations. 1. - Earliest Period. In the south-eastern quarter of the area of rocks there stands a boulder, which by its overhanging sides forms a shelter convenient alike to man and beast. At the present day it is obviously the den of beasts, and in it are bones which showr it has been used by leopards. But in prehistoric times it must have been the refuge of human beings, for in it I found chipped fragments of chert and a piece of crystal. These were not in any sense imple- ments, but they may have been the waste chips thrown away while implements were being made. For they are of material quite foreign to their surroundings, such as could hardly have come to be where they were by accident. Of their age, I am quite incompetent to form even an estimate ; but to their newness I can put a limit - the limit is 2,000 years ago. The cave where they were found has a drip -ledge</page><page sequence="3">No. 63. - 1910.] TANTRI-MALAI. 75 cut along its face ; but it bears no inscription. However, from other inscriptions which will be given later, it is clear that a monastery existed in the Tantri-malai caves about 100 years before Christ, and it is permissible to believe that this cave was occupied at much the same date. The floor of the cave in monastic times was rudely paved with uncut pieces of flat stone, and some ten inches of earth intervened between this and the bed-rock floor. It was on the rock floor that these chips were found. They may be later than I think, but the earth above them and below the pavement held nothing, not even fragments of brick or pottery ; so I think they must be very early. If they had been found all about the cave and at a more modern level they might be taken to be fire-strikers of early Sinhalese date ; but there were no other fragments of similar stone, and these were alone nearly a foot below the old paved floor. The only other objects found at this lowest level were two pieces of what is apparently a fresh- water shell. These results are slender ; but there are several other caves which might yield more if carefully excavated, especially those at Ándiyá-gala, about three miles south of Tantri-malai. 2. - First Buddhist Monastery. When the fine eagerness of early Buddhist zeal led monks and nuns to seek out restful solitudes throughout Ceylon, they very often chose for themselves homes among the rocks. Apart from the history literature affords, all that we know of the early monasteries has been gathered from caves, buildings, and inscriptions on rocks. Throughout the Island, and especially in the northern plain, there are scores of such monasteries. It is hardly a#i exaggeration to say that in the North-Central Province and the Warmi nearly every con- siderable rock outcrop shows some trace of early occupation. Probably it was the water holes they contain which led people to occupy them, for a great many of these rocks contain deep narrow pools which hold a supply of drinking wat or throughout the dry weather - in many cases the only available drinking water for several miles. This water and the shelter of their caves formed their attraction.</page><page sequence="4">76 JOURNAL, E.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. At Tantri-malai, as in so many other places, the first settle- ment of which we have any definite record was a Buddhist monastery founded in the early centuries B.c. To support this view there are three inscriptions,* two of the second or first century b.c., and one perhaps a hundred years more modern. None of these have been published before, but the first was copied by Mr. Bell in 1896. It consists of eleven letters cut □ mieniu Ba ra ta pi da ha ti sa te ra ha in the rock just above one of the best of the natural cisterns, and reads " Ba ra ta pi da ha ti sa te ra ha" As stated above, the letters are łof early form, and may be as old as the second century b.c. " Baratapida " may be a name ; in which case the record would read " [that which] belongs to Baratapida and the monk Tissa " ; or " Barata " may be a name, and pida perhaps derived from pudanavá, to offer. The next record, of about the same date, is cut in the rock by the side of a long cave about 60 yards to the east of the last inscription. It is low down at the east end of the cave. ¡nano, cu A fi a ji ri ya ba ti vi, U k LIjR+-LA ya ma ta u pa si Za na ga ya- It reads " A ti a ji ri ya ba ti ya ma ta u pa si ka na ga ya * See Appendix B. - B., Ed . Sec.</page><page sequence="5">NO. 63. - 1910.] TANTRI-MALAI. 77 and possibly a few more letters now obliterated. The earlier part of it is beyond me ; but from the latter half it is plain that the cave was once the abode of a lady named Naga, who had devoted herself to religion. The last inscription of approximately this period is cut in the rock above a small natural cistern about 150 yards north- north-east of Upásiká Naga's cave. □ kAj b -L W r1 Ba ta su ma na ha ta la cha da Judging by the shapes of the sa, ma, and ha, this belongs to about the time of Christ. It reads " Ba ta su ma na ha ta la cha da," and appears to be complete. Bata Sumana may be taken equally to mean " Brother Sumana," or to be a single name ; but what his talachada may have been I am not able to explain ; tala could possibly be read tale, which means the blade of any sharp instrument, and the record may be simply that Bata Sumana cut his name. Beside these three definite date-fixing records, there are several other remnants of the early monastery. Probably the first monk or devotee who settled there lived in the fine natural cave, afterwards the cell of Upásiká Naga ; but as the community grew, further accommodation had to be provided, and perhaps the cave where the chert flakes were found, and two others near to it, were then occupied. All three have drip ledges cut above their brows, but none bear inscriptions. I attribute to the same period a number of small stone buildings which occur almost at random on quite a number of the rocks. These are in most instances close to some natural cistern, which leads me to believe that they existed before the construction of the tank. There are about twelve of these buildings in all, each built of rough stone fragments which show no wedge marks and which seem to have been naturally fractured. I call them buildings, but as a fact they are no more than little rectangular platforms with no</page><page sequence="6">78 JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. steps or entrances of any kind. Their sides are formed of large rough stones laid in straight rows, and within the space thus formed they are filled • up with stone rubble. Some contain brick debris , others do not, but possibly it may have all been washed away. The four sides of these platforms face approximately the four cardinal points, though in all cases their north is 20 or 30 degrees west of the north, as my compass gives it. They must have been the sites of buildings of some sort, but it is hard to imagine their exact nature : they can hardly have contained much brickwork , for almost all traces of brick have disappeared : they probably were not tiled, for I did not find even a single fragment of tile. It is therefore fairly certain that they were built of wood. Their length from north to south, as a rule, slightly exceeds their width from east to west, and in all cases they were small. I measured several, with the results given below : 16 ft. by 13 ft.; 18 ft. by 15 ft.; 18 ft. by 17 ft.; 15 ft. by 15 ft. From their ruined state measurements must be only approximations . Of the earliest monastery, we have, therefore, the following traces : - One large natural cave, spacious enough to shelter thirty people at least, with an inscription of the first or second century b.c.; an adjacent natural cistern, with an inscription of the same period ; another natural cistern, with a rather later inscription ; and a number of small rudely built stone platforms, once the sites of buildings in which the stones were collected , not quarried, for they bear no wedge marks;" also three lean-to caves beneath boulders in which are no inscriptions, but which have cut drip-ledges. 3. - First Post Christian Monastery. Of the next period, the most important item is the dágaba which stands on the apex of the largest and highest rock. From its bricks Mr. Parker (" Ancient Ceylon," page 244) supposed this dágaba to belong to the second century or early first century B.c. If he is correct, then the dágaba must be added to the description already given of the first monastery ; but, for several reasons, I am inclined to disassociate the</page><page sequence="7">NO. 63. - 1910.1 TANTRI-MALAI. 79 dágaba from the early buildings I have described. Firstly, the stonework round about the dágaba all shows wedge marks, i.e., it was quarried stone, but that of all the little buildings was not quarried ; secondly, the three inscriptions are all remote from the dágaba and in the other group of rocks ; thirdly , the bricks in and around the dágaba, although chipped and broken , still retain their form, while those in the buildings on the rocks are so destroyed and washed that their debris is almost indistinguishable, and it was not possible from any fragment I observed even to tell that it had had straight sides or angles. For these reasons I am inclined to believe that the dágaba is of later date than the other buildings described , and I would prefer to place it with the few buildings on the rock below it on the eastern side. Here there are not only wedged stone pillars, in which the oval wedge marks correspond both in size and in their intervals with those in the wedged stones around the dágaba, but there are also abundance of brick fragments which still to some degree retain their form. Still further to connect these buildings with the dágaba, there is the fact of their position, grouped upon either side of the steps which lead to the dágaba and to nowhere else. Now, the first described buildings were in nearly every case placed just beside a rock cistern, sometimes one on either side of it. These other buildings, larger, less ruined, and containing quarried stone, are not near any such water hole, but are close to the tank. It appears therefore that the tank was by this time the source of water supply. So from a tiny settlement we can trace the monastery's growth until there were stone-pillared buildings, a dágaba,* and a tank. It is interesting to note that from the summit of the dágaba rock several of the great dágabas of Anurádhapura can be plainly seen on a clear morning , without the aid of a glass : Jétawanáráma and Abhayagiri stand out distinctly. It is * At this ruined dágaba I found a brick bearing a design of two lotus flowers. Almost similar bricks were found at Aluthalmillçwa, near Padawiya tank, by the Archaeological Survey in 18 &gt;1 at a dágaba, with an inscription of king Wasabha, who reigned in the later half of the first century a.d. See Annual Report, Archaeological Survey, 1891, p. 10.</page><page sequence="8">80 JOURNAL, H.A. S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. very hard to believe that the names of such great landmarks could get mixed, and that their identity can have been ever forgotten , as Mr . Parker supposes. The Mahá Séya Dágaba on Mihintalé kanda, full four and twenty miles away, is also plain to see. 4. - Last Monastery on Tantri-malai. The last and greatest monastery of Tantri-malai ended in a tragedy. As we have not succeeded in discovering the ancient name of this place, we cannot trace its history, but tragedy, catastrophe, and sudden flight, or death, are plain to see in its archaeology. Upon the rock which the dágaba crowns there is an image of Buddha, and below it another. The former is a sedent figure carved from the rock in high relief, seated upon a throne, with lions carved on the panels. The figure faces to the north and looks towards the dágaba. From almost its very feet there started a grand flight of broad low steps cut in the face of the rock, and designed to lead to the dágaba ; but they were never used. Their edges are as sharp as when the mason left them ; eight steps are finished, and half of the ninth. Then came calamity. On either side of the great sedent image, 8 ft. high upon his throne, the artist had designed four panels, each to contain a smaller sedent image some 3 ft. high. All of the eight panels, four on either side, are traced in the stone, but not one is finished. One has been roughly blocked out, another has been carved almost to the semblance of a man, others are hardly commenced, as they were on that evil day the craftsman left them. To the north of the dágaba, at the foot of the rock, an enormous image of Buddha was carved in the side of the hill. As he lies he is 40 feet long, but he was never finished. The work was very nearly done, but not quite. To the south-west of the dágaba, in the forest, is a stock of wedged pillars and coping stones. They lie where they were quarried, but they were never taken to their places. One long stone has a beaded edge cut with great care, but it was never used.</page><page sequence="9">No. 63. - 1910.] TAN TRI -M AL AI. 81 It is as plain as any written history could be. It is an instance of the true value of archaeology as a stimulus to the imagination. In what is now a solemn jungle there must have been a tragedy. Tantri-malai lies right in the track from Marinar to Anurádhapura ; and it was at Mannár that the Tamil invaders used to land, and to Anurádhapura that they used to march. It remains to find out the date of these great images. Mr. Parker places them, and indeed the whole of Tantri-malai, in the second or first century B.c., or at the latest in the first century A.D. Mr. Bell , Archaeological Commissioner , attributes them to the time of Parákrama Báhu the Great, in the twelfth century a.D. Fortune placed in my way the means of deciding this wide difference of opinion ; for I found an inscription which seems to settle the point. On a rock adjacent to that on which the dágaba and great images are, there are three buildings which by their more modern style and infinitely superior preservation palpably belong to a period quite distinct from that of the other ruins. One is a square building on a rock, having a circumambient verandah of broad dressed slabs of stone ; another is a chamber hewn from the rock and walled up in front with cut and dressed stone ; and the third is a little box -like structure on the summit of the rock in which the cave is hewn. Its stonework resembles that in the cave below, and is neat work adorned by slight pilasters in relief. Mr. Bell in his Report appro- priately calls it a " campanile," adding its traditional name, Pot-gula, or " library." These three buildings are quite obviously of the same date and style. From the evidences of sudden cessation of work, never afterwards resumed, and especially from the half -cut steps , it may be confidently assumed that no important stone work was undertaken at Tantri-malai subsequent to the dispersal of the masons. The images cannot therefore be of earlier date than the three buildings just described, for these exhibit much skill in stone work, and the hewing out of a rock chamber with a cubical content of 1,170 ft. (22 ft. 7 in. by 8 ft. by 6 ft. 51 in.) indicates that both time and labour were available. We can therefore roughly date the images g 36-10</page><page sequence="10">82 JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. from the campanile, &amp;c. The images may be as old, but can be no older. Now on the stones of the campanile letters are to be found lightly traced by the point of a chisel. There is only one on any given stone, and in all I discovered nine of them cut, evidently to help the builder in placing the stones correctly. ¿i S (_n bJQjl f «p 01 SINGLE LETTERS ON STONES OF THE ť ' POT-GULA." From their form the letters can be at once, and with certainty , ascribed to the latter half of the eleventh or to the twelfth century a.d. . So that Mr. Bell's estimate* is entirely supported by first-rate evidence. And it may be assumed that these huge images, which in their style and colossal proportions so nearly resemble those at the " Gal-vihárê " in Polonnaruwa, were commenced by Parákrama Báhu I., or at least in his reign. And perhaps in the raid of Kálinga Mágha, which followed soon after, they were abandoned, and Tantri- malai left to grow up in forest and to become a home of buffaloes and bears. It is satisfactory to have archaeological evidence regarding the date of these great stone figures ; but even without it I think it would have been obvious that they could not belong to the simple times of early Buddhism. The idea of huge images was not entertained until several centuries after Christ. They in their way are fine, but it is not the way of the simple monks who lived in the early cave monasteries. Before leaving this side of the archaeology of Tantri-malai, it may be added that I found nothing to support Mr. Parker's *"They manifestly belong to much the samo period of lithic sculptured art as the five examples at Polonnaruwa "• - Annual Report , A. S„ 1891, p. 8.</page><page sequence="11">No. 63. - 1910.] TAN TRI- MALAI. 83 theory that " Upátissa Nuwara " may have been near or at Tantri-malai.* Upátissa, the capital before the rise of Anurádha- pura, must have been a large town, and I think that had it been here, we should certainly find some systematic water supply in use from the earliest times, instead of finding, as we do, that the first monastery was dependent upon the water-holes. So far I have dwelt only upon the history of Tantri-malai as revealed by its archaeology ; but there is another question which may be found interesting. In three caves at Tantri-malai, in a cave at Billéwa, and in a cave at Andiyá-gala, two places a couple of miles apart and some three miles respectively south and south-west of Tantri-malai, I found rude drawings or paintings on the walls and roof. In each case the cave in which the pictures are is one which has a drip-ledge cut and has certainly been used as part of a monastery ; but the drawings are of a most primitive style, and certainly do not belong to the period of monastic occupation. The cave at Billéwa has an inscription cut in characters which may belong to the third or fourth century A.D. ; the Andiyá-gala cave has an inscription of the same or a little earlier date ; while, as we have seen, Tantri- malai was occupied up to the end of the twelfth century a:d. The drawings are therefore comparatively modern. The neighbourhood is almost entirely uninhabited, but the nearest villages on both the north and the south are occupied by Wanniyás. These people are called ' ' Ver dar " by their Tamil neighbours on the north and " Veddó " by the Sinhalese to south of them, the word in either case meaning the same. They admit that they are Veddás of the Danna gat warigè, the " clan of the bow," bat they call themselves Vil Wanniyár. For they are bi-lingual, and speak both Tamil and Sinhalese impartially. They claim community of race with the Tamankaduwa Veddás, but say that their clan is a separate one. f Curiously enough they claim descent from the Súriya-wansa, the original royal stock of the Sinhalese- * "Ancient Ceylon," page 245. t The Veddó of Tamankaduwa are of the Tala-warigé clan. - B. , Ed. Sec. G 2</page><page sequence="12">S4 JOURNAL, H.A. S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. They are nice, simple, honest people of the forest, rather shy at first, but willing when acquainted to tell one all their lore. It appears probable that the pictures in the caves are the work of their ancestors. However, the present people deny all knowledge of this, and sa}7 that no one draws like that now. I have copied to scale and in their correct colours all the pictures I found ; but beyond this and a few remarks as to their appearance, I do not feel competent to discuss them.* In the majority of cases the subject appears to be the human form ; some hold bows in their hands, and one holds in his two hands what may be regarded either as a bow and an arrow or a sword and shield ; others appear to be animals and birds, and a fine spotted leopard is among the best, though his head is unfortunately missing ; other subjects are mere diagrams, and among these too are obviously bows and arrows, and one apparently the sun. All belong to the same school of art, though I should not expect to find them the work of a single person, owing to the various methods used to express the head. Several are almost spirited sketches, and obviously portray motion. A feature which distinguishes them from most scribblings of the same sort is their chastity and sexlessness. The colour principally used is ash gray, but in two instances black is found, and in three a dull red. All alike seem to have been painted with the artist's finger as a brush, and all are on the bare rock, not on plaster. My hope in copying them was less that they would prove of great interest in themselves, than that they might aid in linking up this northern tribe of Veddás or Wanniyás with the others of their race.f I conclude with a few measurements taken with the idea of testing Mr. Parker's brick theory, and some comments thereon. * Appendix A. I The Archieological Commissioner discovered and photographed Veddá " ash pictures" at Arangoda-gala and Konattegoda-gala near the Mádura-oj-a, during his circuit of 1897 through Tamankaduwa (Annual Report, A. S. , 1897, p. 15). Similar drawings have since been found in Bintçnna by Prof. C. J. Soligmann (Journ., C. A. S. , Vol. XXI., No. Gl, 1908, p. 77). - B., Ed. Sec.</page><page sequence="13">No. 63. - 1Ô10.] TANTRI-MALAI. 85 Mr. Parker says of Tantri-malai : - ť ' The bricks of the dágaba are 3*23 in. thick and 9 *04 in. wide, Bt. (breadth x thickness) being 29*2, and the length either 18 in., making the contents 525 cubic inches, or, if it was six times the thickness, 19 *38 in., which would make the contents 565 cubic inches. In either case the size points to a time late in the second century, or early in the first century b.c."* At the dágaba I measured the ten most perfect bricks I could secure, with the result tabulated below. Where I have put " &amp; + " it means that the brick was broken, i.e., 10 X 3 X 8 &amp; + means that the last measurement has an uncertain quantity greater than eight : - 2f in. x 71 in. x 91 in. 31 in. x 81 in. x 10 in. &amp; + 3-1- in. x 81 in. x 101 in. &amp; + 2 J in. x 10 J in.

Bt. - 24*22, and average thickness 2*85. Further on, Mr. Parker writes: "Colossal, sitting, and reposing statues of Buddha cut out of the solid rock, at which the bricks are of pre-Christian date or the first century A.D.," &amp;c. At the sedent Buddha a well-preserved wall enables one to measure a large number of bricks easily. Eight widths were 9 in. , 9 in. , 9 in. , 9 in. , 91 in. , 10| in. , 11 in. , 1 '' in. , averaging 9*81 in. ; eight lengths were 51 in., 5| in., 6 in., 6 in., 6 in., 6| in., 6| in., 61 in., averaging 6*06 in. The average thickness of 30 bricks was 21 in. Bt. thus is 15*15, and average cubic contents 148*62. On referring to Mr. Parker's Table of Measured Bricksf I find that their size would render these bricks liable to be included in those of 800-1350 a.D. There is no brickwork near the recumbent Buddha which yields such sure results, and I only succeeded in finding two fragments worth measuring : these were respectively 21 in, * " Ancient Ceylon," pp 244, 245. t Loc . cit., p. (573.</page><page sequence="14">86 JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. by 81 in. by (?) and 21 in. by 9 in. by (?). It is possible that they were brought in recent times from the dágaba to serve as stands for joss sticks, and in any case their evidence is not enough to go upon. I have given these measurements at somewhat tedious length, because they are part of my foundations for a disbelief. They are not the whole of the foundations, for I have measured bricks before, and generally only to find that their variation rendered them insecure evidence upon which to found theories. With all respect to an accomplished archaeologist, I venture to predict that Mr. Parker's " Table of Measured Bricks " - what is ordinarily called Mr. Parker's " brick theory " - will never supply a really reliable criterion of the antiquity of ruins. The measurements given above show how two independent people could obtain quite different results from the same material, and I believe that in many other places we should find as great a divergence. Beyond the fact that old bricks are large and newer bricks smaller, I do not believe the ancient Sinhalese had so standardized their brick-making that any measurements based upon the assumption of such a standard are reliable in giving a date even approximately ; though as secondary and corroborative evidence such measure- ments may be valuable. One other observation in the neighbourhood of Tantri-malai bears upon the same brick theory, though in itself it is epigraphical in nature. On page 211 of "Ancient Ceylon" Mr. Parker, in giving a list of the data from which his brick theory was, built up, says : " The list of structures of various periods will probably be accepted as belonging to the dates here assigned." But to one of these I am unable to agree. No. 8 is given as an inscription in a cave at Milléwa-gala Viháré near Tantri- malai, "in letters of the first or second century a.d." which Mr. Parker ascribes to Ila-Naga or one of the earlier Nagas of the second century. The same inscription was copied by Mr. Bell in 1896, and by me in 1909 ; all three readings are the same, and there is no question of identity. The name in the inscription is Na ka ra ja . The writing is identical with that used in Mahá Sena's inscriptions of the end of the third</page><page sequence="15">NO. 63. - 1910.] TANTRI-MALAI. 87 and beginning of the fourth century A.D., and in these he is variously called Senanaka and NciJca. So, if my view of this can be accepted, we get third-fourth for first-second century. In other caves at Billęwa* there are inscriptions of various dates. They can only be judged by the form of the script ; but two appear to belong to a period at least as early as the first century B.c. So we have in one place lithic records covering a period of about 400 years. If I am correct in this it must greatly detract from the value of the bricks as data. We have no means of judging to which part of this 400 years they belong , save by their own intrinsic characteristics ; but as they are given as data this would be mere moving in a circle. It is with reluctance that I disbelieve a theory so well calculated to solve many of Ceylon's archaeological puzzles ; but I am convinced that brick measurements as criteria of dates must be accepted with the greatest caution. f APPENDIX A.

John Still. APPENDIX B. Inscriptions at Tantri-malai. With all due deference I find myself unable to accept Mr. Still's reading of the three inscriptions, quoted in his Paper. Inscription (1). ťť Ba ra ta pi da ha ti sa te ra ha." Mr. Still says : - 4 4 Baratapida may be a name ; in which case the record would read ť (that which) belongs to Baratapida and the monk Tisa ' ; or Barata may be a name, and pida perhaps derived from pudanavá , to offer." This is hardly correct. Evidently the difference between the hard d (Ô) and the soft d (ç) did not occur to Mr. Still, or he would not have derived pida (8©) from pudanavá (gçssck).* Pida is from' " piņda ," a lump, and pudanavá from puj , to worship. My rendering of the inscription is : " belongs to the monk Tissa of (the family of) Baratapida." * Yet chada in Inscription (3) is held to be chada. Confusion of dentals and cerebrais is not unknown in anciont inscriptions. B. , Ed. Sec.</page><page sequence="17">Cave Paintings. J th actual size. TANTRI-MALAI. Plate 1 .

"A ti a ji ri ya ba ti ya ma ta u pa si ka na ga ya." With regard to this inscription Mr. Still says : - " The earlier part of it is beyond me, but from the latter half it is plain that the cave was once the abode of a lady named Nága. who had devoted herself to religion." This interpretation cannot be maintained, as the term " upásilcá " is not applied to a devotee living in a cave or a forest. Such a person is called " tapas ." I would read the inscription as: " a gift of the Upásiká Nága, the mother of Bati (Bhati), the master of elephants." Inscription (3). " Ba ta su ma na ha ta la cha da." Of this, Mr. Still says : - " Bata Sumana may be taken equally to mean ť Brother Sumana,' or to be a single name; but what his talachada may have been I am not able to explain; tola could possibly be read talé , which means the blade of any sharp instrument, and the record maybe simply that Bata Sumana cut his name." This explanation seems rather far fetched. The inscription, in my opinion, simply means : " the shelter of Batasumana." Tala means " place" and chada (îrovachad) "shelter," &lt;ť cover," "shade," &amp;c. March 8, 1910. Simon de Silva. £In order to render Mr. Still's Paper as full and interesting as possible, Mr. H. C. P. Bell, Archaeological Commissioner, has furnished copies of entries recorded by successive Government officials in their Diaries after visiting Tantri-malai.* Supplementary notes made by Mr. Bell,f with illustrations from photographs taken by himself in 1896, and drawings of the Pot-gula " and Cave Shrine, are also added.] APPENDIX C. Accounts of Tantri-malai. I. The rocks, or rather series of bare granite hills, at Tantri-malai are well worth inspection. The naked granite lies in a black mass of undulating hills of solid rock , with plots of shallow grass in the depressions of the undulations, the whole rock mass covering about a square mile. * Appendix C. f Appendix D.</page><page sequence="26">90 JOURNAL, H.A. S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. On the highest point of the rock are the remains of a dagaba with a bó-tree planted in earth brought up from the jungle below ; and on opposite sides of the rock on which the dágaba stands are two enormous rock statues of Buddha. One is in the sitting posture, nearly 6 ft. high, with two women, one on each side, fanning the deity with " yak tail " fans ; on each side of the statue is a woman with one of these fans, below that a lion on each side, and below that again a dragon on each side. The statue is cut more than 2 ft. into the living rock, and the face of the carving bears traces of the cement on which the colours of paint were laid on the statues, as at Anu- rádhapura. Opposite this statue are a flight of steps cut in the rock, and between the statue and steps the remains of temple. On the other side of this stone hill is the other statue, in the usual " nirwána " attitude, but of enormous proportion. It is 45 ft. long by nearly 15 ft. deep across the arms and chest, and the whole is cut 5 or 6 ft. deep into the solid rock. The nose has been broken off and lies beside the statue. It is about 18 in. long, and it was with difficulty I could lift it in both hands. The tradition amongst the people is that the wild bees incessantly make their combs in the nostrils, and that the Vçddás in the neighbourhood as incessantly eat the honey. Both statues are still very perfect. On a smaller stone hill near the one described above stands a small square stone temple made of rectangular stone, with only 5 or 6 cubic feet space inside and with a small door facing the east. The appearance of the upheaved mass of undulating rock cover- ing nearly a square mile is very striking. - Diary , July 15, 188o. S. Haughton, Assistant Government Agent, Mannar. II. At Tantri -malai there are a series of huge granite rocks. On one of the highest there is a trig station. Mihintalé and other Anuradhapura hills are plainly visible - also another trig station on Mullamalai, and one overlooks low-country all round as far as the eye can reach, except on the south-west, which is higher ground. There is here a well-cut and preserved reclining figure ot Buddha, which I made out to be 38 ft. long, cut in the face of the granite rock, which seems to have been split for the purpose of giving a flat perpendicular surface. On the top of a rock further off is a bó-tree, I think- a ficus at any rate - and below it another figure of Buddha in a sitting posture cut in the face of the rock. Stone pillars, some standing,</page><page sequence="27">NO. 63. - 1910.] T ANTRI-M AL AI . 91 others fallen, once supported a roof over the path leading to the figure. The sitting figure is cut in a recess hewn out of the rock. On either side of the sage are figures of gods or demi -gods fanning him. There are cut figures on either side of the recess, and stone steps leading up to the bó-tree. On another, almost inaccessible, rock at a little distance, is a square building of cut stone, and in the base of the rock is an artificial cave in which a priest has lately been spending a 4 ' retreat" of three months. The cave is now uninhabited except by bats, and I wonder how the priest could have stood the stench. - Diary, April 20, 1886. W. J. S. Boake, Assistant Government Agent, Mannár, LII. To Tantri-malai and back to Olukkuļama, 16 miles. I went to this place in order to make a few measurements, as requested by a marginal note on my Diary of April 20, and also to make a few sketches ; but was rather put out of conceit with the expedition on hearing from Mr. levers that a Capt. Hogg had already been there and taken photographs, which he had sent to the Governor, who had passed them on to the Asiatic Society.* However, I am glad I went, and it may be that I have noted some little thing which has escaped previous observers. I have been trying to fix the position of the place on Ferguson's map, which is the only one I have with me; but I cannot find any place on the map nearer to it than Olukkuļama, which is somewhere about the 38th mile on the Mannár road. It lies in a south-westerly direction from Olukkuļama, and one passes by Kappachi of the Vavúniyá district across the Aruvi-ár through the Veddá village of Nochchikuļama of the North-Central Province, and by the base of the Mullamallai rocks. At Tantri-malai went first to the cave below the rock. The cave was cleaned out and there were some mats and chatties, but the priest was said to have gone to Anurádhapura. The cave I did not measure the dimensions of ; but the entrance is blocked up by a mud wall leaving just room for a man to squeeze in. Within, it is about 10 ft. by 6 ft., and there is standing room. It is cut about half way up the rock, and the distance from the base of the cave to the top of the building on the rock is 34 ft. measured over the surface of the rock. Opposite to the entrance to the cave, which was formerly of cut stone and having a porch, there is another rock of much greater dimensions, and on the slope of it is constructed a raised * Capt.

XXII. platform paved with slabs of rock, some of which measured 10 ft. 10 in. by 3 ft. 3 in. thick - some of them in situ. The platform is about 20 ft. square. I then went to the sitting Buddha, which is excavated out of the solid rock near the top of the highest rock in the place. The sitting portion of the figure is obscured by bricks and stones. I took a sketch from the steps leading to the dágaba on the top of the rock. -What the height of this rock is I do not know, but I should judge it to be from 150 to 200 ft. to the top from the level out of which it rises. The dágaba is a small one , and the bo -tree seems to be growing in it. The full length figure is exactly 40 ft. long, and I regret to say that the right arm is broken off. The nose, of which the nostrils are fully carved, came off some years ago. - Diary , August 23, 1886. W. J. S. Boake, Assistant Government Aģent, Mannár. IV. I went to Kappachi in the morning, and, after inspecting the village and tank, on to Tantri-malai in the Anurádhapura District. Here there are some very interesting ruins ; two Buddhas carved in high relief out of the solid rock, and a curious little stone house on the top of a rock very similar, though on a smaller scale, to one at Dondra in the Southern Province.* - Diary , September 23, 1886 . G. M. Fowler, Assistant Government Agent, Vavuniya. V. Went to inspect the ruins at Tantri-malai. They consist of a group of rocks covering a space of about 60 acres as far as I can see. Fine grassy glades separate some of the larger rocks. The place must have been the abode of Buddhist priests, for ruins of pausólas are to be found. There is a most picturesque little square block-house on the top of a conical rock about 30 ft. high. The little house is built of cut stones laid one on top of the other, one stone running the whole * The Dondra ruin, built on high ground, differs.

The roof is flat, and is similarly made of cut stones. Cornices of carved stone project on the outside edge. There is a tradition that ancient manuscripts were kept in this " book house " (S. Pot-gé ), and a copy of a portion of the Malta - wansa is said to have been found in it about a hundred years ago. At the base of the rock and immediately below the ť 4 book house " is an oblong chamber, 111 ft. long, cut into the solid rock to a depth of 71 ft. It is not a chamber built up on the slope of a rock, as is usually found, but is cut square into solid rock. The front must have been closed in by cut stones, part of which still remain in position. The remains of an old palace [no] similar to those at Anurádha- pura are to be found on the rock on the opposite side to this eli amber. On the slope of another rock is the recumbent figure of Buddha carved out of the solid rock, standing out slightly ; and scattered about are pillars, &amp;c. There is also an old bó-tree surrounded by a very old dry stone wall. I had to give up further exploration on accoimt of heavy rain. Four holes in rock above chamber to let beams in, pillars, &amp;c., showing that there was a room in front of the chamber. The size of the book house is, height 5 ft. , 5 ft. broad, and 5 ft. long, by rough measurement. A Buddhist priest from the Seven Kóralés, Kurunégala District, came and asked for permission to occupy and improve Tantri- malai, as pilgrims were in the habit of going there, and that he wished to restore the place with the aid of alms and contribution. He said ho had a book in his village containing a full description of Tantri-malai. He described it as an old history of the place. It stated that the stone chamber on top of the rock was a 4 ť book house," and that it was rifled of its contents during the time of the Dutch. Asked the priest to produce the history, and said that I would recommend to Government the granting of the rocks to him, provided he gave some guarantee that he would restore the place. - Diary , December 78. 7889 C. A. Murray, Government Agent, North-Central Province. VI. The Tantri-malai ruins have been described by Mr. Haughton in his Diary of J uly, 1883, but his description of the sitting Buddha and surrounding figures is not quite right. The "guardians " on each side of the central figure are on a level with its shoulders, and underneath each of them is a makara (mythical animal composed out of a crocodile, an elephant,</page><page sequence="30">94 . JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. and a peacock) ; underneath each makara is a lion rampant with face turned away from the figure. Mr. Haughton puts the " clraggons " under the lions. The figure is cut in a recess in the face of the rock, and as the face slopes away towards the top the recess is much deeper at the bottom than at the top. It is about 5 ft. deep at the bottom and about a foot or so at the top. It is about 9 ft. long by 8 ft. in height. The figures being protected in this way from the weather are in an excellent state of preservation - as good as new, in fact. The head of Buddha is surrounded at the back by a cobra's hood.* There are pillars in front of the recess, and holes in the rock where the beams of the roof evidently rested, showing that originally there was a temple built up against the rock, with the face of the rock containing the recess to form its back wall. On the right of the recess, i.e., on the right hand side of the figure, are two similar figures of Buddha [.nc] about half the size, also cut in the rock, but not recessed. One of these is so obliterated by exposure to weather as to be hardly distinguishable as a Buddha. t Mr. Haughton does not mention these figures. Over the recess are three lines cut in the rock, to carry away the rain water I suppose. In the side of the large rock surmounted by the small house (described by Mr. Fowler in his Diary of September 23, 1886) . there is a rectangular chamber cut out of the rock (about 8 ft. long by 6 deep and () high, as well as I remember). This I found occupied by a Buddhist priest and his servant, a deaf and dumb man, who have lately established themselves here. - Diary , November 22, 1890. J. P.

The ruins at Tantri-malai are well worth visiting. The sedent Buddha with a guardian on either side and lions below are a beauti- ful piece of carving, and should be photographed. The recumbent Buddha has been much damaged about the face and right arm. The nice little square stone room on top of the rock, said to be a " Pot-gula is very curious, and in good preservation. I have never seen a similar one. It looks modern from a distance. I have ordered the bund of the tank to be restored, and then there will be water at Tantri-malai, which will be a boon to travellers. - - Letter , July 24, 1896. E. M.

Took measurements, notes, and photographs. Tantri-malai is an enormous reach of flattish rock, stretching far and wide. Near the edge of a gal-wala is a single line inscrip- tion - the only record yet discovered here. The stone-carved images recall, and may be contemporary with, the " Gal Viháró " at Poļonnaruwa. The main points of interest are : - (i.) " Pot-gula " (so-called), and Cave beneath. (ii.) Sedent image on ornamented ásanaya with maleara to rana behind, all rock carved. (iii.) Dágaba. iv.) Recumbent image of Buddha, hewn from the rock. * Mr. Ridouťs drawing of the " Pot-gula " is reproduced on Plate A. - B., Ed. Sec. t Notices of Tantri-malai occur in the Official Diaries of Messrs. S. Haughton (1883); W. J. S, Boake (1886); G. W. Fowler (188G); C. A. Murray (1889) ; J. P. Lewis (18%) ; R. W. levers (1891).</page><page sequence="32">96 JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. (i.) " Pot-gvla." Mr. C. A. Murray's description is concise : - " A most picturesque little square block-house on the top of a conical rock about 30 ft. high. The little house is built of cut stones laid one on top of the other. The roof is flat, and is similarly made of cut stone. Cornices of carved stone project on the outside edge." It has one entrance. There is a tradition that ancient manuscripts were kept in the house, hence its name " Pot-guln ." Below the ťť Pot-gula " (6 ft. 2 in. by 5 ft. 4 in. high)* is an oblong chamber cut into the solid rock (measuring 12 ft. 6 in. by 7 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft. in height)* with remains of dressed stones, which closed in the front. This might have been the true " Library," the campanile on the crest of the rock being intended for some other purpose. Owing to its confined inner space (3 ft. 2 in. by 4 ft. 10 in.)* it could admit only one person seated. Opposite the " Pot-gula " on a larger rock is the square basement of some building formed of large dressed slabs. (ii.) Sedent Buddha. The image with its moulded sinhásana (throne with dado of lions) is cut in high "sunk relief " from the steep side of the rock undulation. The figure is 8 ft. in height ; its ásana 3 ft. 3 in. high by 9 ft. in length, and 5 ft. 6 in. in depth.* At the back is con- ventionally represented part of a well conceived maleara torana , with rampant lion supporters, facing outwards on either side ; and, above, a couple of chámara bearers. The execution of the whole falls short of the finish and magni- tude of the not dissimilar ot-pilimaya at the " Gal Viháré," Polonnaruwa. (iii.) Dágaba. On the highest point of the Tantri-malai rocks is a small dágaba dwarfed by its surroundings. (iv.) Recumbent Buddha. Beyond the dágaba (which stands between it and the sedent Buddha) is carved a colossal full length figure. The image measures 38 ft. from head to feet.* It has scaled badly from exposure to the elements. The right arm and nose are broken ; and altogether the figure is in a sorry condition as compared with the seta pilima of Polonnaruwa, which is exceptionally perfect. No rock record is known fixing the name and age of the Tantri- malai ruins, but they manifestly belong to much the same period of lithic sculptured art as the fine examples at Polonnaruwa. - Diary , September SO to October 5. f H.

TANTRI-MALAI. 1. - " Pot-gula." * This box-like campanile - probably a " meditation cell" - • constructed, sides and roof, of eight courses of clean-hewn granite slabs, stands on the summit of a bowl-shaped upheaval of the Tantri-malai rock outcrop. Its stones are dry laid and plain dressed, except at the four corners, which aro cantoned by simple narrow pilasters with bracket heads. The vertical walls are crowned by a heavy (1 ft. 6 in.) pro- jecting cornice of double cyma and rectangular moulding, finished by a straight blocking course (5 ft. 9 in. square). Roof slabs horizontally trabeated. Within, the walls slide into the flat roof by a chamfer and fillet. Measurements : - Plan, dimensions 6 ft. 2 in. square (outside), 3 ft. 2 in. (inside) ; height, 5 ft. 2 in. to 5 ft. 8 in. (outside) according to level of rock base, 3 ft. 7 in. to 4 ft. (inside) ; entrance, 2 ft. 4 in. wide. 2. - Cave Shrine.f Cut into the bottom of the rounded rock, upon which the " Pot-gula " was erected. Measurements : - Inside, 12 ft. 10 in. broad by 8 ft. 6 in. deep at present floor level (silted up), but 6 ft. 10 in. at horizontal roof ; height, 6 ft. 2 in. at entrance, 6 ft. 10 in. within. A gal-ásanaya, or stone seat, at the back of the cave, is barely visible above the accumulation of bats' deposit which has gradually buried it. The entrance (3 ft. 9 in. in width), on the north, is at the middle of the front wall of cut stone (1 ft. 6 in. thick), which stretched 7 ft. to either side of the doorway. This wall is now only 4 ft. in height. Above the brow of the cave, below a leatáré , or drip line, are cut four mortices, which once took the ends of roof beams. Outside the wall a single complete pillar (with semi-octagonal shaft) and one or two stumps show that a vestibule formerly preceded the cave. 3. - Sedent Buddha.ļ; The Archaeological Commissioner, in October, 1896, found the small brick-walled shrine in front of the sculptured image and its accessories choked with débris , which hid everything up to the Buddha's waist. The shrine itself was freed of brick and earth ; but time and weather did not then permit of thorough excavation of the walls outside and along the base of the rock to left and right, or of other desirable digging at Tantri-malai. * Seo Plates A and C. t See Plates B and C. % Seo Plates D and E. H 36-10</page><page sequence="34">98 JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. The ot-pilimaya, or seated image, its ásanaya , and " supporters " are all carved from the îrock matrix in a sharp -sided recess (11 ft. 5 in. high by 9 ft. 3 in. broad, with a depth of 6 ft. at the bottom, and only 2 ft: 10 in. at top) cut into a northern shelving face of the rock plateau at one of its steeper, but not very deep, undulations. As the top edge of the ásanaya touches the rock's sloping surface, only its front is shown, no space having been left on either hand to carry the carving round so as to exhibit its sides. In breadth 9 ft. 3 in., it rises 3 ft. 3 in. above the rock floor. The lines of the moulding are the familiar ogee plinth, block between fillets, and cyma coping. The central dado (1 ft. deep) is divided into five panels by four pilasters having spreading base and capital. Conventional lions of the homely " china-dog with frilled-mane" type, seated cat-like fronting ( sejant gnardant ), occupy the three middle panels, and a profile lion, turned outward (passant guardant), each of those at the end. The Buddha, sculptured in three quarter round, is seated well back (2 ft.) on his throne. The figure is represented in the posture almost universally adopted in Ceylon - the dhyána múdra , or attitude of meditation - crossed-legged (the right foot and ankle above the left, soles upwards), and hands with open palms laid on the lap similarly. The robe (sañg ala sivura) droops from the left shoulder, hiding the left arm, but exposing the right breast and arm. An oval face, thick fleshy lips, pendent ears (no longer weighted with the rings of royalty), and sleepy half -closed eyes give to the countenance a sleek expressionless look. A sir espota, or " glory," crowns the ushņishika (skull pro- tuberance) above the stiff hair curls of the head, which is backed by a plain raised circular bhámandala or halo. The intention was doubtless to cut behind the figure a toraņa of uprights and cross bars like that at the Cave Shrine of " Gal Viháré," Polonnaruwa; but, beyond the completion of the pair of maleara heads (with trunks coiled) which would have terminated the ends of the uppermost transons, none of the carving of the arch was executed. At the "Gal Viháré" the sedent Buddha is not only flanked (as at Tantri-malai) by a pair of rampant lions, but "supported" on either side by an attendant bearing a chámara , or fly whisk, with two gods (Bráhma and Vishņu) of the Hindú Trimurti above the toraņa and sêsata overhead. Here exigences of space forced the sculptors to compress the four anthropomorphic figures into two, supplanting the dêviyó by the chouri holders (coiffured in turbans instead of mukuta head gear) and to forego the chatra altogether. Measurements : - Buddha, height (exclusive of the sirespota, 8 in.) from ushņishika to thighs, 7 ft. 6 in.; from knees to rock at back, 3 ft. 9 in.; across shoulders, 4 ft. 4 in.; waist, 2 ft. 1 in.; elbow to elbow, 4 ft. 9 in.; across knees, 7 ft. 7 in.; head, 8 ft. 8 in. by 1 ft. 6 in. ; ears, 1 ft. 4 in. long ; hand, 2 ft. 1 in.; foot, 2 ft. 2 in.

They stand 9 in. above the ásanaya. Each chámara káraya (2 ft. 11 in. in height) is heavily, but differently, adorned with a variety of ornaments ; both wear the upavita , or Bráhmanical cord. Some 6 ft. on either side of the recess containing the Buddha are incised - more or less shallowly - four oblong panels from 3 to 4 ft. in size. The three outer panels on the right are merely outlined ; as are the two towards the left end. But in the first and second panels respectively the carving of a figure in relief has been begun, though it is barely " boasted out." The first panel on the left alone holds a figure, roughly finished, seated cross-legged, with hands in lap like the Buddha, but differentiated by its mukuta, or tall-peaked head dress. Perhaps the intention was to delineate eight Badhisatrayó. From the one, central, entrance to the shrine of the Buddha (no longer roofed) there is gradual ascent by a couple of steps succeeded by two flights of nine, separated by short landings - all of easy going, with low risers and very broad tread. These stairs , 8 f t. 6 in. in breadth, are cut crisply in the galpota, or rock outcrop, and lead up towards the dágaba situated on its summit. Sockets at the half-way landing betoken a former pillared and roofed portico. 4.- Recumbent Buddha.* The gigantic seta pilimaya is sculptured at a brow of the plateau below the dágaba, also facing north. It represents the Maháparinibbána of Gautama Buddha, and was manifestly intended to be a close replica of the colossal recumbent image of the " Gal Viháré," Poļonnaruwa. The carving of the head, forearm, and bolster which underlies them, was never quite finished. Further, the head and left bent forearm have been deliberately damaged, and the features of the face are now indistinguishable. The whole length of the recess in which the figure lies is 40 ft. 8 in.; but the image itself, finished with a sir espota 9 f would not measure more than 38 ft. 4 in., or simply from the ushņishika to the soles of the feet only 36 ft. The figure is shown in the orthodox pose. It lies on its right- side, with head supported upon the right hand, both resting on a bolster. The left arm and hand, with extended fingers, lie flat along the side, whilst the feet are stiffly placed one upon the other. All but the right breast and hand is covered by the upper robe ; the under robe (andana sivura) is just seen exposed at the ankles. Measurements : - Head, 5 ft. 2 in. across ; ear, 3 ft. 10 in. by 10 in.; height, left shoulder to right forearm, 10 ft. 10 in.; height at thigh, 7 ft. 3 in.; left arm, 13 ft. 3 in.; hand, 5 ft. 3 in. by 1 ft. 6 in.; foot, 2 ft. 8 in. broad. * See Plate F. ■f Capt. Hogg's photograph (No. 25) shows the sires pota or flame pro- cess. It is now virtually obliterated. H 2</page><page sequence="36">100 JOURNAL, R.A.S. (CEYLON). [VOL. XXII. That monarch's inscription and the testimony of the Maháwansa prove that the images of the " Gal Viháré " at Poļonnaruwa were undoubtedly executed by Parákrama Báhu the Great (a.D. 1164-1197). The rock-sculptured figures at Tantri-malai were also almost certainly carved, if not by the same ruler, at least by Nissaņka Malla (a.D. 1198-1207), his only worthy successor prior to the subjugation of the Island by the Southern Indian invaders under Mágha, which followed within a few years. That sudden inroad, and the chaos that ensued, probably pre- vented the completion of the images, &amp;c. , and brought about the final abandonment of Tantri-malai as a Buddhist monastery. H. C. P. BELL, Archaeological Commissioner. 8. The Ven. the Archdeacon, Messrs. B. Horsburgh, P. E. Morgappah, and Rev. Suriy agoda Sumaņgala took part in the discussion which followed the reading of the Paper. 9. Mr. B. Horsburgh said : - Having had the advantage of a visit to Tantri-malai in the company of Mr. Still, I can testify to the fidelity and carefulness of his description of that most interesting place; and, so far as my knowledge goes, I would also subscribe to the general correctness of the conclusions ho has drawn from the silent eloquence of the rocks. The evidence of some sudden and overwhelming disaster falling upon the little community while it was engaged in beautifying the settlement by the rock carvings of the two Buddhas and the flight of steps to the dágaba is most direct and impressive. I make no pretensions whatever to archaeological knowledge, but it seems to me that in the name itself there is some confirm- ation of Mr. Still's theory, that the disaster was due to a raid of Tamil invaders. The name appears to be partly Sinhalese and partly Tamil. The " malai " can, I think, only be the Tamil word meaning " hill," while the " Tantri " is distinctly Sinhalese in form, and is found in the existing gê name of Tantrigé or Tantrigamagé. I know of no Tamil word at all like it. About 21 miles E.N.E. of Tantri-malai is a small group of rocky hills, much higher than Tantri-malai, which bears the name of Mulli-malai, an entirely Tamil name. We had not time to explore this Mulli-malai further than by climbing to one of its highest points, but we saw no signs of general religious occupation, such as are so much in evidence at Tantri-malai. Tantri-malai was, therefore, the chief settlement, and the invaders would probably know its Sinhalese name, whereas they had to invent one for Mulli-malai. We approached Tantri-malai from the east, crossing the Mal- wa tu-oya to Mulli-malai, and then taking a compass line through the forest to Tantri-malai, a route probably followed by no other white man, and it was interesting, in view of what Mr. Still</page><page sequence="37">_l t/.JB.AĪ.Kidout citi: Plate A. i JLith: S.Û.O.Jf*lZ* oetober /3/0.

Mr. Still's notes on the " Wanni minissu ," who are, of course, Veddás, are very interesting. I have seen the drawings he describes, but can offer no explanation of them. They are such as might have been made by a hunting party hold up in the caves for a few days in idleness owing to heavy rain, or - and the fact that their descendants deny all knowledge of them is significant - they may have some religious or ceremonial meaning, because, when visiting the nearest village of these people to Tantri-malai, we observed some cattle in the field branded with the identical bow and arrow that is drawn in the caves. I am, however, quite incompetent to say if totemism has anything to do with it. 10. The Ven. the Archdeacon proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Still for his interesting Paper. Mr. Horsburgh seconded. - Carried. 11. The Chairman said he was sorry Mr. Still was not there that night, but that he would be very pleased to convey to him the vote of thanks which had been proposed. They were much obliged to Mr. Horsburgh for his suggestive remarks. 12. With a vote of thanks to the Chairman, proposed by Sir J. T. Hutchinson, the Meeting terminated.</page><page sequence="44">ERRATUM. Page 99, line 16, for " Bodhisatrayó " read " Bodhisatvayó."</page></plain_text>
