<plain_text><page sequence="1">Astral Representations in the Archaic and Classical Periods and their Connection to Literary Sources NICOLAS YALOURIS (Pls. 38-40) From very early times the Greeks endeavored to capture the nature and form of the universe, par- ticularly of those stars which, being close to the earth, were directly connected with their life. They also strove to learn the nature and form of the earth on which they lived. Without ceasing to be awed by the wonders of creation and without dis- missing mythology and divinity, they tried to ad- vance their knowledge of the universe, basing their search on man's intellectual capacities. Thus, they established philosophy and also the approach of sci- entific observation and interpretation of phenom- ena by freeing themselves from the theocratic con- cept of their times about the creation of the universe. The first intellectual stimuli and the earliest se- rious attempts to comprehend the nature of the world appeared as early as the 7th century B.C. In the course of the 6th century philosophical re- search was intensified by Greek thinkers and stu- dents of philosophy, especially those who lived in Ionia. It was from there that all new ideas traveled to the mainland and spread around Greece. Fre- quently the philosophers themselves were the car- riers of new theories, since they traveled and taught in the cities of the Greek mainland. Did these ideas and theories of the Presocratic philosophers about the origin and nature of the world have any bear- ing on contemporary art in Greece? I will touch upon only a few aspects of this topic, which I have been studying for several years. First the column or pillar: they are both well known as cosmic symbols and at the same time as aniconic representations of deity. In this aspect the column, worshipped earlier in the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures, as well as in the Orient, kept its character, without interruption, into historical times.' It became then an unquestionably impor- tant symbol, associated with the universe. More- over, it should be kept in mind that gods, who are often represented aniconically, are also the lords of the universe-gods such as Zeus, Apollo, Helios and Selene.2 It is the column or columns which keep together the earth and the sky. Later on, the column became the axis crossing the earth, both when the Greeks considered the earth disc-shaped and when later they discovered its spherical form.3 Because of this theory, the ancients identified the column with Atlas, as bearer of the sky; Atlas in turn was often represented as a column.' The concept of the column as a cosmic symbol became very popular in the archaic period. It was also adopted in the vocabulary of the Presocratic philosophers. The student of Thales, Anaximan- der, according to Theophrastos taught that the form of the earth is cylindrical.5 Furthermore, ac- cording to Hippolytos, Anaximander, in defining elsewhere the characteristics of the earth, noted that its shape is curved, rounded, similar to a column made of stone. The upper surface of the column is where we live." The same notion about the earth 1 A. Evans, "Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult," JILS 21 (1901) 99-204; M.

Anaximander taught in mainland Greece and even at Sparta, which was a noted cultural center, eminent in literature and art, in the middle of the 6th century B.C., before the city was radically transformed into a virtual military camp. It should be noted that Anaximander, according to ancient literary sources, pointed out the solstice (rpo0r'7 7xilov) and the equinox (th Ecpla) and invented the sundial which he set up in Sparta.' He also made the first geographic map, as well as the first map of the universe.8 A Laconian cup, now in the Vatican, attributed to the Arkesilas Painter, is dated around 550 B.C.9 (pl. 38, fig. i), therefore from a period which cor- responds with Anaximander's stay in Sparta. The vase is decorated with an extraordinary representa- tion of the two boundaries of the world: to the right, in the East at Caucasos, Prometheus is bound to a column; to the left, in the West, Atlas sup- ports the heavenly dome on his shoulders. This cosmic creation, so unexpected for this period, is however in line with the spirit and the philosophi- cal pursuits of the time. Furthermore, it is worth noting that this cosmic composition rests on the upper part of a Doric column. This representation of the column, unique as it is among Laconian cups, reminds us of Anaximander's theory about the columnar shape of the earth. Might not the painter of this cup have been inspired by Anaxi- mander, who lived during the same period in Sparta, where he taught about the universe and the shape of the earth? 1 Atlas and Prometheus are represented on the upper part of the column, which according to Anaximander was the inhab- ited portion of the column-shaped earth. Prome- theus is bound to a column, which is probably an echo of the column-shaped earth. It also seems that the painter derived some inspiration from an older literary tradition. Hesiod (Theogony 5.521) de- scribes Prometheus as "bound to a column by pain- ful chains" ("&amp;a~Eo?t dipyaX'oaL ~'oov &amp;t Kidova"). There are many scholars who think, however, that the same column also supported the sky in the orig- inal myth of Prometheus." On a contemporary krater from Vari in At- tica, displayed in the National Museum in Athens, there is another representation of Prometheus bound to a column."2 To the same period belongs a composition with Medusa seated on an Ionic cap- ital, within a panel on the leg of a tripod from the sanctuary at Olympia.'3 In this connection should also be mentioned the many representations on black- and red-figure vases showing the rising He- lios or Eos and the sinking Selene, who frame col- umns which could be related to Anaximander's column-shaped earth.'4 These are but a few exam- ples chosen from a large corpus of similar works: was their production stimulated by Anaximander's thoughts on the shape of the earth? The Presocratic philosophers also considered the shapes of the other celestial bodies. Anaximander observed that the stars are circles of fire: ",a,=pa ylyvaeOaL Kat KXp rvpod"; he also describes the Sun and Selene as blazing circles.'5 Others liken the stars to nails fixed on the firmament: "~Xov 6SKlqv KaTra7rerqy~;v vat rTa rpa Tr KV'rTaXXhoEtiE",1 while still others said they are "like petals of fire as if painted": "7rraTa 7rvptva wlcrrEp a oypap aTa".' Ac- cording to Parmenides, stars are "wntX~jara wvp" ("compressed wool of fire"). 8 More specific, however, is the description of Archelaos, student of Anaxagoras, about the shape of the stars; he describes them as red hot masses of stone or metal ""t'8pov 8La,&amp;r'pov,3."19 Demokritos also considers the sun as a red hot mass of metal or stone: "t'pov 7ETirpav ta'7rvpov."20 7 Vorsokr.

They appear most frequently in vase painting, especially as devices on shields. I. Stars in the shape of a "circle of fire," as de- scribed by some philosophers:21 A. Attic black-figure amphora in the Villa Giu- lia, no. 63572, ca. 540 B.C. On the shield of the Amazon to the right, white circular spots appear as a shield device; B. Attic black-figure lekythos in the Villa Giu- lia, no. 50561 (pl. 38, fig. 2). The warrior in the middle has the same shield device as on the pre- vious vase (A); C. Attic red-figure cup in the Villa Giulia, no. 20761. The shield of an Amazon has the same device. In these examples (there exist many more in every great collection of Greek pottery), the shield de- vices seem to represent the stars in the form of fiery circles. II. Stars conceived of in the form of "nails fixed on the firmament:"'a the most representative exam- ple is the black-figure lekythos, National Museum of Athens EM 1132 (pl. 38, fig. 3).23 The stars and the crescent moon are painted in white on the rec- tangular firmament carried by Herakles.24 III. Stars in the shape of "petals of fire," as de- scribed by other philosophers:25 Attic black-figure amphora, Munich no. 1413, the Leagros Group (pl. 38, fig. 4). The warrior in the center has a shield device of two petal-like shapes.26 IV. Stars in the form of "compressed wool of fire" or of "red hot masses of stone or metal"':27 A. Attic black-figure hydria, British Museum B 523, late 6th century B.C. The white spots used as shield devices for two warriors, the third from the left and the first on the right, seem to illus- trate the stars as red hot masses; B. Attic black-figure hydria, British Museum B 338, late 6th century B.C. (pl. 38, fig. 5). One or more white spots decorate the shields of some Giants. White, usually applied for the rendering of the spots on black-figure vases, denotes the golden or blazing body. In the red-figure technique, stars are usually rendered by black spots. There exists a large number of similar shield devices, of all the types discussed above, on vases and other works of art of the 6th and 5th centu- ries.28 Such representations often alternate with rayed stars: A. Attic black-figure amphora, Taranto, Museo Nazionale, ca. 530 B.C. (pl. 39, fig. 6). It depicts Poseidon(?) against a giant. The shield of the latter has a star device; B. Attic black-figure hydria, British Museum B 331, ca. 530 B.C. The warrior, third from the right, has a star as a shield device; C. Laconian krater, Louvre, Campana Z448, late 6th century (pl. 39, fig. 7). A star decorates the black field of the vase. The interpretation of these shield devices as stars is confirmed by the frequent presence of a crescent moon with them: A. Attic red-figure Nolan amphora, Hamm, Gustav-Liibke Museum (pl. 39, fig. 8); B. Attic black-figure amphora, British Museum LA 340;29 C. Attic black-figure amphora, Vatican;30 21 See supra n. 15. 22 See supra n.

Attic red-figure amphora by the Andokides Painter, Louvre F203;31 E. Attic red-figure amphora, British Museum.32 During this period the subject is popular as a shield device. Even Athena's shield and her aegis are decorated with stars represented as blazing "masses." They often surround the crescent which has replaced the gorgoneion: A. Panathenaic amphora attributed to the Swing Painter, British Museum B 144 (pl. 39, fig. 9). A star with rays as the shield device of Athena; B.

A crescent moon surrounded by stars shaped like black spots on the aegis instead of the gorgoneion.34 The marble replica of the Athena Rospigliosi in the Palazzo dei Conservatori has an aegis on which the gorgoneion is kept, but it is nonetheless surrounded by stars.35 The statue may reflect a prototype inspired by the same ambience as the Nausikaa Painter's Athena. The connection of Athena with cosmic symbols in the archaic and classical periods is therefore confirmed by many monuments,36 some of which are discussed above. Among the many others which exist, I would like to single out only one more: on a small Panathenaic amphora (pseudopanathenaic) in Oxford, Athena's shield has as device a white spot, obviously a star, while on each of the columns which frame the statue of the goddess is the solar disc, instead of the usual cock." I have previously presented the conclusions to be drawn from this vase.3 It should be pointed out that the same sym- bol (disc on a column) also appears on a Lucanian vase (a nestoris) in Bonn." In both works, the column reminds us of Anaximander's theory that the earth is column-shaped. The connection of column and solar disc sug- gests the shape of hand mirrors. These mirrors may have originally been connected with cosmic symbols, before their message became secular. The stand of such mirrors sometimes has the form of a column (pl. 40, fig. 13);40 it is often replaced by an anthropomorphic figure.41 The position of such fig- ures on hand mirrors is exactly the same as that of Atlas holding the sky.42 Archaic art did not, however, only depict the celestial bodies in geometric shapes, but often com- bined them with the corresponding anthropomor- phic representations. Astral figures, such as the Sun (Helios), the Moon (Selene) and the Dawn (Eos), frequently appear, often with a disc on the head in scenes in which they are driving their chariots or riding: A.

This connection is demonstrated by the numerous astral representa- tions which then appeared in Greek art. In the early part of the 5th century the old ideas of the philosophers about the celestial bodies con- tinued to dominate contemporary thought, but the description of these phenomena was often different from what it was in the 6th century. The earth, where men live, was conceived of as disc-shaped, elongated and concave in the middle.49 According to Anaxagoras, the earth is simply flat and wide (- iarn-ta).50 For some it had an apsidal form (= v8v7ai)5" and for others it was like a drum (- rtvpravov).52 Still others reached the conclusion that the earth and the celestial bodies move and rotate in the universe, which was described as spherical.53 At the same time the conception of the spherical form of the earth was gradually coming to maturity. This idea was already familiar to Plato,54 and seems to have been developed earlier, probably by the Pythagoreans.55 Representations of astral deities increase during this century. The best known artists and vase painters frequently il- lustrated celestial bodies personified, or their sym- bols, or both. But the most significant accomplish- ment of the Greeks of this age was the awareness of the universe within which the earth travels. The picture of the universe captured the minds not only of thinkers, but also of writers, poets and artists. Relevant literary sources and works of art provide abundant testimony for a definite conception of the universe. This vision of the universe was sometimes the subject of the decoration on the entire surface of a vase. For example, an Attic red-figure hydria in the Bibliotheque Nationale (pl. 40, figs. 15 and I7),56 dated to ca. 425 B.C., has as its sole repre- sentation the moon, the stars and Pegasos. The stars, which have now partly faded, are shown in an old drawing (pl. 40, fig. i5). Pegasos, who must have already been established as a constellation, roams the skies in this magnificent rendering. No other figure or decorative pattern appears on the dark surface of this vase. The human figure has been replaced by the fascination with the universe, which dominates the painter's vision. The dark 43No.G.
