ISBN 0-8248-2190-4. Oh, how I wish that I had had this book when I first set foot in Hawaii! The occasion was the Botanical Society of America meeting in Honolulu, the year 1992. After the conference, we decided to tour the island of Oahu and the big island of Hawaii, to botanize and to check out the volcanoes. I managed to cobble together some data on the flora from several older volumes that I turned up here and there, but if I had had a book such as Hawaiian Natural History, Ecology, and Evolution back then, I would have had all the basic information at my fingertips. And this, in turn, would have increased my already intense pleasure in discovering the Hawaiian fauna,</page><page sequence="2">122 Book reviews flora, and lava flows.

Of floristic interest, too, are those chapters on Polynesian ecology and historic ecology, which, for example, trace the history of economically important plants in cultivation. One drawback of this book, ironically, is that it does a very good job of covering the entire spectrum of natural history, which means that for any given topic it does not go into the great depths that a professional scientist might desire; once I had gleaned out all the botanical passages in the book-which, in the end, tallied up to a considerable amount-I still found myself thirsting to find out more about the native flora. The reader is also best served if he or she has at least a nodding acquaintance with the native plants, as they commonly lack an English name; however, I personally found that the use of the Hawaiian names for places, animals, and plants added that extra dash of exotic spice to the text. Of course, the Latin names of the taxa are used throughout the book. There are 28 color plates of photos or drawings in the center of the volume. The photos are spectacular, one more captivating than the next. One remarkable plate that will remain forever etched in my memory, features the abdominal markings on a series of Hap pyface Spiders (Theridion grallator), which look like big, grinning cartoon faces, replete with black fuzzy eyebrows, red-colored mouths, and white buckteeth on the light colored rump of these eight-legged creatures. Peppered throughout the text are many well-drawn line figures and maps and good reproductions of black-and-white photos. The use of these illustrations would facilitate lecture preparation, although I would imagine that supplementary graphics in the form of color slides, photos, or videos would certainly be necessary to capture the attention of today's students. Indeed, a list of recom mended audiovisual aids is available at the end of each chapter, as well as at the back of the book. Hawaiian Natural History, Ecology, and Evolution offers a good overall, integrative, and up-to-date overview of the natural world of the Hawaiian islands. Instructors and students alike will benefit from using this textbook. Although it would be much too specialized for the average tourist to the Aloha State, this book is really a useful guide to the natural history of the Hawaiian islands, and would well prepare any "professional natural historian" (i.e. botanist, zoologist, geologist) for the natural wonders to be encountered on these Pacific islands. Oh, how I wish that I had had this book when I set first foot in Hawaii! Carole T. Gee Bonn, Germany DOI 10.1007/s00606-004-0251 -y</page></plain_text>
