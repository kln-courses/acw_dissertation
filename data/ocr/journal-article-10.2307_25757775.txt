<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fallen into Outer Darkness Later Byzantine Depictions and Conceptions of the Devil and the Demons Richard Greenfield Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario This paper concentrates, like others in this volume, on the iconography of evil, here in the historical context of the later Byzantine period which is taken to include the 11th to 16th centuries.1 I begin by looking at purely graphic images of the Devil and the demons from this time, but then attempt to examine these in relation both to the far richer contemporary literary traditions and to the wider conceptual tradition of the later Byzantines on the subject of evil.2 The overall pattern of this study thus follows the general line of approach to the study of iconography established by Panofsky (1955) while taking into account some important adaptations and developments as proposed by, for ex ample, Gaignebet &amp; Lajoux (1985:17) in the context of profane medieval art and popular religion. In examining this material I find myself inevitably drawn down the path trodden by many recent historians of Western medieval Europe and, as yet, a smaller number of Byzantinists who have sought help from the discipline of social anthropology in gaining insight and understanding into their chosen fields of study.3 The very nature of the subject matter here, for instance, forces an exploration (albeit in a very minor way) of the relationship between learned and popular culture or, if we are to follow the rather persuasive argu ments of Lauwers (1987; cf. Le Goff 1977a,b) concerning the medieval situa tion, between culture ecclesiastique or clericale and culture folklorique.4 With equal inevitability I find myself venturing into the fields of orthodox and pop ular religion and of great and little traditions while hopefully avoiding at least some of the many pitfalls associated with those terms (described e.g. by Badone 1990:4-7) by speaking in general of standard orthodox and alternative tradi tions of belief and practice which I understand here as being closely related to the concepts of doctrinal and local or practical religion as outlined by Stew art (1991:11) in the modern, rather than Byzantine, Greek context. As with the subject of Western medieval magic (Kieckhefer 1989:1, 16-17), one has to see that of Byzantine demonology as standing quite starkly at a crossroads be tween these cultural areas which are at one level fundamentally related but are ETNOFOOR, V(l/2) 1992, pp. 61-80 61</page><page sequence="2">at other levels often very differently expressed and even diametrically opposed. It is thus not enough to look only at the conceptions and depictions of the evil powers which issue from the learned (and thus infinitely better preserved and more easily accessible) levels of Byzantine culture; one has also to pay attention to those which are found in the more recondite strata of that society's popu lar culture. Furthermore one must also delve into the 'mental substratum' of Byzantine conceptions of evil, into the 'plane of content' behind the 'plane of ex pression' (Gurevich 1988:xviii-xx) if one is ever to contemplate arriving at even a partial understanding of what I call here the overall conceptual tradition, the mentalite of later Byzantine people concerning the powers of evil; the tradition which embraces (whether this is expressed in terms of overarching or underpin ning) the more particular literary, artistic, oral and mental traditions of belief and practice found at all cultural levels.5 In pursuing these goals I also find myself following the pattern of recent developments in the study of European witchcraft where the need has been seen, and the usefulness demonstrated, of moving towards an acculturational approach to the phenomenon; of looking into relationships between the central culture and its peripheral subcultures (Ankar loo and Henningsen 1990:3, 8, 10). The model is one which may be applied quite helpfully to the present study which attempts to consider the beliefs, ideas and expressions of evil that are found in the central culture of later Byzantium in relationship to those expressions discernible in the various sublevels of that culture. Later Byzantine depiction of the devil and the demons When Byzantine religious artists wished to depict the Devil or the demons they generally employed a standard, 'generic' form: that of a small human figure, which had wings on its back and was black (or sometimes dark brown or blue) in colour. Whatever the scene being illustrated, whatever the source of the incident or its purpose, the powers of evil could be shown in this way, generally hovering in the air around their victims or standing beside them, and it is clear that with these standard characteristics displayed they would be immediately recognisable to the viewer for what they were. Thus, in general, it is true that Byzantine art, certainly in comparison to that of the medieval West, was very limited in its depiction of demonic beings and indeed attention has been drawn to Textreme pauvrete de l'art orthodoxe en representations diaboliques' (Ducellier 1979:201). On occasion, however, the Devil and the demons were shown by Byzantine artists in a number of other, generally theriomorphic forms, and one or two specific representations were relatively common. In such instances some supplementary knowledge of the context of the incident being depicted or the allusions being made in the illustration was necessary before the characterisation could be identified as being that of an evil being. 62</page><page sequence="3">To understand what lay behind the characteristics evident in the depiction of the generic form and also how these beings could be illustrated in a variety of other forms, it is necessary to look at the traditions of belief which underlie and motivate the graphic images of the Devil and the demons, for there both the central unity and diversity of these representations find an explanation in notions of the nature and origin of the powers of evil held by the Byzantines. In the general Christian tradition to which these beliefs and their artistic rep resentations belong, and in the particular development and interpretation of that tradition as it existed in standard orthodox Byzantine Christianity, the demons were believed in origin to have been created by God as angelic beings. Led, however, by one of the foremost angels, Lucifer, whose pride caused him to rebel against God, a whole rank of these angels fell from heaven becoming perverted in the process into powers of evil. These beings retained some ele ments of their former, and created, angelic nature and they were thus thought to be immortal, incorporeal, immaterial (or at least subtle), and intellectual or spiritual beings. In other ways, however, they lost all the grace and virtue of their former condition and became distorted into beings who displayed charac teristics which were the exact opposite of those possessed by the angels. These fallen powers were thus seen as being evil, dark, unclean, angry, deceitful, hos tile and envious, and in particular these facets of their character were believed to be employed against the human race which had been created by the God against whom they had rebelled and which had been enabled by him, both in the original Paradise and, potentially, after the restoration achieved through the incarnation of Jesus, to enjoy that which they themselves had lost irretrievably by their fall. This combination of angelic and fallen characteristics, this mixture of imma teriality, malevolence and deceit fulness, is what allows us to understand the appearances of the powers of evil in both the wider Byzantine conceptual tradi tion and more specifically in that of religious art, at least in its more standard, orthodox forms. Most important here is the fact that the Devil and the demons were believed to be capable of changing their shape at will, of metamorphosing into whatever form best suited their intentions and the situation at hand; of possessing, in other words, no specific shape of their own at all. Thus, while they could be thought of or depicted as 'negativized' angelic beings, as in the standardized and clearly limited generic form referred to above,6 they could also take on an infinite variety of appearances and they are also represented at times in some of these. Clearly there is not the space in a short essay to provide more than the most cursory illustration of such representations, but it is perhaps worth giving a brief description of the most characteristic depictions while comparing and elaborating these with evidence of the same or related conceptions found in the surviving literary tradition.7 Examples of the generic depiction of the demons are thus found very widely indeed throughout this period in all the media that were used for such purposes, 63</page><page sequence="4">most notably icons, murals, mosaics and manuscript miniatures. An example in which the Devil is depicted in this way, drawing on the New Testament episode of the Temptation of Christ, is found in a 14th century mosaic in the church of the Chora (Kariye Djami) in Istanbul (Provatakis 1980:58, Eik. 26, 27; Un derwood 1967:1.114-117, 11.222-225, 227). The same scene with very similar representations of the Devil is also illustrated in a mural from the monastery of Ayios Nikolaos ton Anapavsa at Meteora in central Greece, painted by Theo phanes the Cretan in 1527 (Provatakis 1980:Pin. A'). Here the Devil is rep resented as a dark figure with large sweeping wings which emerge between the shoulder blades. He is depicted as being about half the height of Jesus and is barefoot but draped in a knee length, flowing mantle which is fastened across one shoulder. In both illustrations he has wild, seemingly windswept hair which streams backwards and upwards from his head. His face is sharp featured but that of an ordinary beardless man, while the skin of the rest of his body is also smooth and his feet are perfectly human in appearance. This absence of any pronounced bestial characteristics is typical of the representation of the evil powers in standard Byzantine religious art of this period and is in marked con trast to contemporary conceptions and depictions in Western Europe. Some therianthropic features such as horns, tails and extensive body hair are known from Byzantine depictions of the evil powers. For example, some (but not all) of the demons shown in miniatures contained in a manuscript of 1362 illus trating the temptation of Job have short, deer-like tails and pronounced hair on their calves and thighs (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 15-17, 266; cf. Pin. 0', Eik. 36; Pin. AA'). Such features, though occasionally discernible, were most cer tainly not thought to be necessary for recognition nor were they even com mon during this period, but it is apparent that influence from the West led to a gradual development in the inherent, but minor conventions of Byzantine art in this respect, especially from the 16th century onwards (Provatakis 1980: 53).8 The generic representation of the demonic powers is not confined to biblical scenes, of course, and may be used in the illustration of hagiographical material and of moralising themes. A clear example of the former, hagiographical use appears in a 12th century miniature illustrating the early life of St. Cyprian of Carthage; here small, winged, inky-black anthropomorphic demons are shown emerging from and hovering above the basin in which Cyprian the magician is conducting a lecanomancy (Provatakis 1980:Pin. A', Eik. 96). Examples of the latter, moralising use occur in many depictions of the 'heavenly ladder' which was used to illustrate the spiritual dangers besetting those who wish to lead a virtuous life. Here demons with the same characteristics already described, although sometimes now armed with bows and arrows or with ropes, are shown hauling the would-be saints from a ladder which mounts from earth to heaven and dropping them into the gaping jaws of the dragon or giant which represents Hades (hell), Death and the Devil. Perhaps the best known example of this scene 64</page><page sequence="5">is found in a 12th century icon from the monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 87; also Stewart 1991:145). This generic form is clearly reflected in the literary sources when speaking of the demons. Here, however, the medium of the written word allows for more vagueness in description, while at the same time its greater contextual capabili ties render such stereotypes (which are anyway alien to Byzantine conceptions of demonic nature) less necessary, with the result that the precise combination of characteristics that has been described above is rarely, if ever, found. The demons are thus frequently described by such adjectives as skoteinos (dark) and zopheros (murky, gloomy) or by the related though slightly different term akathartos (un clean) (Greenfield 1988:24-28) and one of the commonest forms in which they are said to appear is that of an Ethiopian, Arab or other dark skinned man.9 The relation between the conceptual tradition and its depiction in art is illustrated quite clearly here by the fact that the demons or the Devil are not described as having wings, as one might perhaps have expected; instead it becomes clear that this characteristic of their graphic representation is a convention designed to ex press the belief in their natural immateriality and incorporeality. In the literary sources and their underlying traditions they are thus commonly associated with the air, which is regarded as the place in which, after their fall, they dwell, hold power, fly and from which they may appear to terrify or mislead their victims (Greenfield 1988:13-16). In the overall conceptual tradition perhaps the most characteristic trait of all that is attributed to these evil beings is their deceitfulness, expressed in literature by such terms as dolios (crafty, tricky), skolios (crooked, twisted), and pianos (deceiving, leading astray) (Greenfield 1988:30-32). This facet of the demonic character is again clearly a negation of their angelic truthfulness and constancy, and it manifests itself not only in the treachery and deviousness of their intentions but also in the multiplicity and unreliability of their appearances; furthermore, when combined with reflections on their immateriality, it is used as a way of explaining (and, in the standard orthodox tradition, belittling) their method of operation through metamorphosis and the possession of real people and animals in order to achieve their ends.10 It was this 'protean' transformational ability which allowed an explanation to be provided for the appearance of the Devil or demons in so many different guises in both the biblical and more particularly the hagiographical traditions without resorting to the supposition that there actually were many different un changing types of demon. This belief thus lies at the heart of standard orthodox Byzantine demonology, explaining its superficial diversity and guaranteeing its essential unity. Obviously the ability possessed by these powers to change and appear in forms chosen at will is more easily expressed in literary than graphic images. Thus the almost limitless variety found in the former medium (which includes such forms as serpent, dragon, scorpion, false angel, woman, soldier, monk, stranger and numerous black animals or birds) is replaced in the latter by 65</page><page sequence="6">a very small number of rather standardised depictions, such stereotyping being necessary in order that the 'disguised' demon may be recognisable as such to the viewer who is also dependent on clues provided by a conventional context and an independent knowledge of the traditions underlying the episode or scene being illustrated. Perhaps the most familiar form which the Devil but also the demons were believed to adopt was that of the serpent. This appearance rests primarily on interpretation of the biblical story of the garden of Eden in the book of Genesis but it receives further biblical backing at a number of points in Old and New Testaments and recurs in many hagiographical episodes; it also undergoes a great deal of elaboration, particularly where the Devil or demons (now supported from the New Testament by Revelation) are seen as dragons. Here literary and artistic representations are quite close; the story of the fall of Man and the horrors of the Last Days were so well known as to need very little contextual introduction, and so the serpent or dragon form could be used to represent the Devil or a demon in graphic depictions without fear of ambiguity no matter how elaborate these became. Apart from illustrations of the Genesis story itself other commonly depicted scenes or motifs include the beast of Revelation, the dragon of the abyss or Hell (already referred to above), the victory of the military saints George and Theodore over the dragon, or episodes from the lives of St. Marina, St. Symeon the Stylite or various other holy men and women. In Fall scenes the serpent was usually represented in a relatively naturalistic way, coiled in the branches of the tree or upon the ground and either carrying the apple in its mouth or whispering in the ear of Eve (Provatakis 1980:134-137); use was made on occasion, however, of an ancient tradition which held that the serpent in Eden had resembled a camel (Kelly 1971; Provatakis 1980:Eik. 222). The literary tradition, while describing the scene on numerous occasions, was not entirely certain whether the Devil had simply made use of a real serpent, whatever its precise shape, or had actually transformed himself into one in order to deceive the woman, but it was quite definite in seeing the Devil as both most suitably represented by the form of a snake or dragon and in adopting this form very frequently (Greenfield 1988:37-38, 44-46). The Byzantine artistic tradition depicts many variations on the dragon form although again considerable elaboration and development takes place only af ter the 16th century under external influence when the dragons of Orthodox Christian art become much closer to their Western counterparts in appearance. Perhaps the most developed dragon forms before that date occur in representa tions of the Beast from Revelation 12 where the written source material is very detailed. Even here a manuscript of 1422, for instance, can present a very snake like creature when depicting it. In two illustrations the beast is thus shown as having a thick, coiled body without legs and, although it does have the required ten horns and seven heads piled one above the other, the latter are simply those of snakes with long flickering tongues; in another depiction in the same work, 66</page><page sequence="7">however, the serpentine body of this creature merges into the front half of a lion with two legs and one large and six smaller leonine heads (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 160, 163, 174). The dragon of the abyss, which was equated in Byzantine belief with Death or Hell, was used in literature and art to represent the Devil because of his identification with death, for it was through his malevolence and deceit that death was understood to have entered the world (Greenfield 1988:47-50). Here, however, the Byzantine artistic tradition was still divided at this time as to whether Hell should be depicted as a dragon or a giant and both forms are found in variations on the same scene. Thus in two 16th century mural representations of the heavenly ladder from Mount Athos in northern Greece the erstwhile saints, ensnared by the demons, fall into the gaping jaws of a coiled, almost snail-like monster, which is entirely serpentine except for its head; this possesses the eyes, horns, snout and teeth of a more typical dragon (Provatakis 1980:Pin. IA', IT'; Eik. 88, 89). In the 12th century icon of the same scene from St. Catherine's on Mount Sinai, the jaws are those of a black giant rather than a dragon, and this is the same form shown, for example, in a 9th century miniature where a great black giant who personifies death clutches his stomach as Lazaros is restored to life by Jesus (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 87, 48). Elsewhere, in illustrations of the descent into hell the defeated power of death is represented simply as a generic Devil figure bound or trampled by Jesus or an angel. The same typically serpentine dragon form is also found in artistic depictions of the victory of the military saints George or Theodore, such as the 11th century mural from Goreme in Asia Minor where the two mounted warriors pierce a coiling legless monster with their spears (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 117) and it is only after this period that the dragon they slay becomes more familiar in appearance with legs, wings, horns and so forth. Again, this same slightly developed but still basically snakelike form is evident in both artistic and literary traditions depicting some appearances of the Devil or a demon to various saints. Artistic representations like the well-known 6th century silver relief image of Symeon Stylites being attacked by an enormous bearded serpent while sitting on his column clearly exemplify such notions (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 124), and they are reflected very closely in literature (Greenfield 1988:86). The only other animal form from the overall conceptual tradition in which the Devil was also depicted artistically with any real regularity was that of a scorpion and here such an appearance was limited almost entirely to illustrations either of Luke 10.19 and its saying that the followers of Jesus could trample upon snakes and scorpions, or of an incident in the Life of St. Demetrios when he was attacked in prison by a demonic scorpion (Provatakis 1980:237-240, Eik. 209; Greenfield 1988:82, 86 n291). Despite the frequency with which appearances in either false angelic form or in various human and animal forms were recorded in the literary tradition and the prominent part such notions evidently played in the conceptual tradition as 67</page><page sequence="8">a whole (Greenfield 1988:77-89), the Devil and the demons seem almost never to have been represented in such ways in Byzantine art, presumably because of the problems in making them recognisably demonic while maintaining the fiction of their disguise. One partial exception is the form of a soldier which is found in a wide variety of literary episodes (Greenfield 1988:85) and which is certainly related to the very common metaphor of battle and fighting for encounters with the demonic powers (Greenfield 1988:129-132), but even here artistic depictions are generally limited to the generic form, supplemented by such weapons as spears or bows and arrows (Provatakis 1980:123-124, Eik. 15, 16, 20, 67, 87). The other partial exception, that of demonic powers in female form, will be discussed below since the normal literary episode in which a saint is tempted to sin by the demons in the guise of real or imaginary women is entirely absent from the artistic repertoire, and the only 'female' demons which are represented do not belong to the mainstream tradition of Byzantine Orthodox Christianity. It is clear then that Byzantine graphic representation of the powers of evil, when compared with the literary tradition and the overall conceptual tradition of the same society, is extremely limited. Bound by the almost unalterable constraints of their own representational traditions, Byzantine religious artists found few ways in which they could express the nature and powers of the demons. Here one is forcefully reminded of the almost insuperable problems involved in dealing with visual images (or material artefacts) in isolation from, or without knowledge of, the wider tradition to which they belong. Apart from helping to fill in the picture of the overall conceptual tradition of later Byzantine people concerning this subject (as that involves the areas of mental images and oral, literary and artistic expression of all levels of society), the representation in art of the evil powers here may, at best, be said to support what can be learnt from - in the absence of oral sources - the surviving literature. The powers of evil as negative representations It is an uncontestable fact that the whole tradition of standard orthodox Byzan tine demonology and its manifestations in both religious art and in literature are dependent on a complex and hierarchical web of biblical, patristic and hagio graphical traditions. Underlying each major, and many minor elements of the Byzantine conception of the demons and their activities are a range of precedents which motivate and lend substantiation to the contemporary expression of belief. Generally, in the educated or at least religiously trained segment of Byzantine society which produced such material, there will have been a vital and respectful awareness of this depth of tradition. This awareness will have carried over, in part, probably to the majority of people who will, though not conversant with all the details of patristic theological development, have had, at the very least, a superficial familiarity with the principal biblical and hagiographical episodes 68</page><page sequence="9">through the readings heard in the rituals of the Christian religion, through the legends of the saints which abounded in popular culture (Stewart 1991:154) and through the graphic depictions of such episodes which were on view in all churches and religious buildings. I shall take just one example here. The quite common notion of the Devil or a demon appearing in the form of an angel in order to deceive someone received its precise biblical foundation in II Corinthians 11:14 where St. Paul asserted that 'Satan disguises himself as an angel of light'. This belief, which was al ready dependent on earlier traditions (Langton 1949:138, 191), clearly requires an understanding and acceptance of the whole notion of the origin and nature of the demons which could make such a transformation possible. Then, a num ber of major patristic authorities, who were read regularly in later Byzantine religious institutions, develop and substantiate the idea, often simply repeating the biblical quotation in an appropriate place but at other times adding consid erable elaboration. Palladios (Lausai'kon:25) thus recounts a story in which a certain hermit called Valens was deceived by the demons into believing he was in contact with angels, their apparitions culminating in a vision of a thousand angels with lights who surrounded the Saviour himself. With the concept thus firmly established and supported in the earlier Christian tradition it passes into contemporary Byzantine hagiographical literature (and perhaps even ascetic ex perience) and on into popular culture. Gregory Palamas in the 14th century (Peter:31-34) recounts how St. Peter the Athonite was tempted in his cave by the Devil in such a disguise, pretending to be 'an arch-general of the glory of the Lord'; while the more popular biographer of the 11th century stylite saint Lazaros Galesiotes includes two episodes in which monks are caused to believe that they are being escorted by angels or are in direct contact with heavenly powers in order to excuse or substantiate heretical or unacceptable behaviour (Gregory the monk Lazaros:47, 49). The notion of demonic appearance as a false angel is thus established, developed and popularised and, when it recurs, brings with it a wealth of connotations and allusions which are rooted in the weight and depth of this particular branch of the demonological tradition. It would be a grave mistake, however, to pretend that, in itself, a knowledge of the detailed and complex religious traditions which underlie the demonological beliefs of the later Byzantines can provide a complete or even thorough under standing of their place in the broader conceptual framework of those people. To do so would be seriously to underestimate the role played by such conceptions and also, perhaps even more importantly, to divorce them in some crucial way from the living tradition and thought of the actual people in whose minds they existed, of the society within whose confines they operated. Thus, although the religious tradition is most certainly there and may be said to govern in some ways the depiction and conception of the evil powers, it is nevertheless true that these beliefs may also be seen as a collective representa tion, as a reflection on the supra-human level of all that the Byzantines felt was 69</page><page sequence="10">contrary to the conduct of proper human society. In other words, the depiction and conception of the demons may be viewed, and indeed may perhaps be used as a trace for, all the negative individual and social values of those Byzantines of this period for whose beliefs we have evidence.11 In their most abbreviated forms these negative values may perhaps be summed up by the description used for the demons in the title of this paper, 'fallen into outer darkness'. If this cluster of images is unwrapped it may be seen that in one way the demons represent all that is fallen. By their own fall from heavenly grace, by causing the original fall of Adam and Eve (the forebears of all humanity), and by their continuous subsequent attempts to bring about the spiritual downfall of all mankind, be it in history or the present, they work and have always worked to undermine and destroy the proper functioning and pattern of society which, for the Byzantines, was understood to mean in ideal that of God's people organised according to His principles (Sherrard 1965:43-46, 111? 113; Kazhdan and Constable 1982:34-36; Mango 1980:218-219). By their fall, and the pride which led to it, they put themselves outside that proper society and seek, as they have always sought, to entice as many as they can to cross the same barriers. By acting in a way which ran fundamentally against the proper functioning of heavenly society they caused themselves to be thrust out of it and in consequence they never cease to propose modes of conduct which are unacceptable to the present society and which will ultimately lead to exclusion from salvation, from the society of the saved who will live in heaven with God. Finally, by their fall and exclusion from the society of heaven, they exchanged the light of that existence for its negation and thus became dark. They represent all that is contrary to the light in physical, spiritual and, above all, moral terms. From the first they sought, and they continue to seek to pervert and to sully all attempts by members of God's society to lead an existence which is illuminated by proper and righteous goals, and instead they seek to cast them into the shadows and darkness of a life filled with immorality, perversity and sin. Clearly there is not space here to develop this theme in great detail but a brief examination in this context of some demonic characteristics may be helpful. For instance, the negativity of the demonic is perhaps expressed most clearly of all by its equation with death. As has already been mentioned, the Devil was regarded as the source of death, since it was through him that mankind fell in paradise and thus was condemned to partake of its natural mortality. Thereafter he continued to possess the power of death until the incarnation of Christ offered mankind the chance of eternal life, although, since this was not guaranteed, the Devil still retained considerable apparent authority in this area and was believed to do all he could to secure the condemnation of as many as possible (Greenfield 1988: 47-71). For the Byzantines, then, the demonic powers represented the ultimate negation of life itself and with this all that decayed, rotted and declined; they were the symbols of corruption whether this was the physical corruption of the individual's body through disease, deprivation or age, the spiritual corruption of 70</page><page sequence="11">the individual and collective soul through sin, or the moral corruption of indi vidual, community and society alike through immorality and irreligion. All these misfortunes and failings are associated with demonic activity and are regarded as characterising it, just as they are regarded as characterising the opposite of all that was necessary for individual and communal well-being - life, health, moral ity and correct religious belief and behaviour. Since the fall of man was also regarded as being the source of all hardship, pain, toil and misfortune these too were associated with the demonic powers, who thus represent the opposite of the idealised individual and communal life of rest, ease, prosperity and good-fortune. Similarly, because they were deprived of any chance of returning to the heavenly state from which they had fallen (Greenfield 1988:21-22), the demons were believed to be characterised by, and to be the instigators of all human grief and despair. Lured by them into misery and depression (which was here classified as a moral failing) it was believed that people could be led to ultimate and hopeless condemnation through rejection of God (the sin against the Holy Spirit) and through suicide (Greenfield 1988:116 118). They stand for the opposite of the hope and joy necessary to individual and societal well-being. Fallen from heaven, permanently exiled from their previous angelic grace and glory, the cause of humanity's own exile from the paradise in which God had placed it, the demons of Byzantium represent all that lies beyond and outside human society which aims to recreate, in however shadowy and flawed a form on earth the ideal and glorious society of the heavenly kingdom around its New Jerusalem, Constantinople (Mango 1980:151-153; Sherrard 1965:79-100). Their characteristics of rebellion, anger, strife, hatred and resulting disorder (Green field 1988:28-30, 68-71, 81, 112-115) contrast starkly with the peace and love of idealised social behaviour and the attempts of real society to achieve at least enough harmony and cooperation to survive. It is no surprise then to find them closely associated with the wilderness, with all that lies beyond the physical, spiritual and moral boundaries of community and society (Kazhdan and Consta ble 1982:41-42); it is there that they are sent when expelled and it is there that holy men venture to challenge and destroy their power and to test their own spiritual strength (Greenfield 1988:57 n202, 144 n471, 233, 301; Mango 1980: 160-162). It should also be no real surprise to find that their descendants, the demonic beings of modern Greece, are known collectively as (e)xotika - those from outside (Stewart 1991:164-169; 1985;47-50). Discussion above of the forms they may adopt has already illustrated both their characteristic deceitfulness and mutability. To the Byzantines the demons repre sented all that was unstable, uncertain, unreliable, untrustworthy and insecure; they stood, in other words, for all the things which make human relationships, be these individual, communal or societal, impossible; they stood for the very opposite of the permanency stability, trust and security that the Byzantines ide alised in their view of the society of God's people as the earthly reflection of the 71</page><page sequence="12">heavenly kingdom. Moreover, they represented all the purely individual charac teristics which undermine social relationships; in particular they were described as selfish, proud, angry and envious, constantly encouraging and pressuring their victims to put their own individual desires and interests above those of the family, community or society. Finally, the demons were seen to represent all that was unclean, impure and polluted (Greenfield 1988:27-28); they stood for all that was prohibited or deemed improper by society in terms of behaviour and thought. This was particularly so in the area of sexual behaviour where the demons were connected with lust, lack of self control and all deviant or socially unacceptable conduct (Kazhdan 1990:143), and were seen to work with especial success through women who were regarded as weak (rather than innately evil) and thus easy prey to the promptings of the evil powers who not only brought about their own corruption but employed them in the temptation and moral or spiritual destruction of any men with whom they came into contact. Here they represented the opposite of Byzantine individual and social ideals of chastity and virtue which extended from monastic Me into that of ordinary society as well (Kazhdan and Constable 1982:70-71, 160; Mango 1980:224-226). According to the standard orthodox tradition of Byzantine religious belief the demons were, thus, the embodiment of all that was thought to be evil. Whatever earlier traditions underlay these concepts, whatever support and development can be traced in the biblical, patristic and earlier hagiographical traditions for their more precise depictions and representations, it is clear that these demons could provide a fairly comprehensive summation of evil for the later Byzantines, and it is also clear that this evil was perceived as the negation of all contemporary individual and social values. The demons were not simply a representation or projection of inherited and possibly outmoded concepts of evil but were part of a vital and living tradition which embraced and pervaded the present though it was rooted in, developed from, and supported by deliberate and careful reference to the past.12 The demons acted as a mirror, a negative reflection on a plane above that of the simply human which elevated, evoked and established by contrast the behaviour and society which the Byzantines regarded as being ideal. Popular conceptions of the demons Although it is very brief, what has been said so far should, I believe, be enough to demonstrate that it is possible to attain a reasonably coherent picture of how the demons were represented in art and literature during the later Byzantine period, and to derive from this pictxrre some information concerning shared individual and social concepts of negative value. There is, however, a serious problem here if one wishes to suggest that these findings are representative of the overall conceptual tradition of the later Byzantine world. 72</page><page sequence="13">Almost without exception, the evidence considered, both artistic and literary, comes from a level of society which was exceptional in that it had received a degree of education considerably above the average and was thus at least semi literate since it was familiar with the basic religious texts if not the whole avail able range of Byzantine learning (Mango 1980:147-148). As has already been mentioned above, it is true that the beliefs and characterisations of this group seem to have been very widely shared throughout Byzantine society, chiefly be cause they belong to the central religious tradition which, in this context, was almost universally acknowledged and of influence even over the least educated and lowest strata of society. Nevertheless such material cannot be said to pro vide anything approaching a comprehensive picture of the conceptions of later Byzantine society as a whole. Our understanding of such patterns of belief and notions of negative value at what may be called the popular, practical or local level is enhanced in only a limited or even negligible way. We know quite a lot, for a medieval historical situation, about a portion of Byzantine society, but this portion becomes increasingly insignificant as we travel away from the intellectual centre toward the peripheries of belief. There is thus unmistakable, if not very comprehensive evidence that popular beliefs concerning the demonic beings differed at times substantially from those of the overarching or underlying religious tradition. This evidence has survived in only a very piecemeal way in literature and even less so in the iconographical record, but nevertheless there is enough to draw certain conclusions about later Byzantine popular belief in this area and compare it with the sort of material that has been examined above (Greenfield 1988:151-302). In the confines of this present paper a rather limited discussion will hopefully suffice to illustrate the importance of including such evidence of alternative traditions in any examina tion of the overall conceptualisation of evil in Byzantine thought. It is clear, for instance, that popular conceptions of the demons tended to see particular individuals or groups as possessing fixed and unchanging attributes, be these of form or behaviour. Furthermore, this consistency allowed the demons here to be named, individualised and classified in a variety of other ways, and indeed these alternative traditions depended on a belief in such individualisa tion as well as an independence from divine control in order that the demonic powers might be used in acts of magic, sorcery and divination. The constancy, the fixity attributed to the demons here obviously separates them from the sort of demonology accepted by standard orthodox Byzantine religion. For reasons which have been discussed above that tradition did not believe that demonic beings had or could have permanent form, and it was also extremely reluctant to attempt any definition of individual demons by names, characteristics or ac tivities precisely in order to avoid suggesting that they possessed powers in their own right and so could act independently of God's overreaching control. To take a single example, a number of references in late Byzantine literature of one sort or another indicate that there existed a definite popular belief in 73</page><page sequence="14">a demonic being which was explicitly female in gender. This demon is almost always described as having long, wild, sometimes snakelike or feathery hair, while claw like nails, sharp teeth, burning eyes and a fish tail may also be added to the picture. It is usually given some variant of the names Gylou or Obyzouth. This being was always viewed as vicious, and was principally associated with the sickness and death of unborn children, babies and their mothers, although other variants either of the same or related creatures were said to arouse the lust of men and then mock, hurt or destroy them (Greenfield 1988:182-190). Although the notion of an essentially female demon was unacceptable to stan dard orthodox belief and finds no place within it, it is interesting to note that this element of popular belief is scarcely less well endowed with traditional and historical support than its orthodox counterparts; the sense of the importance of traditional backing and a marked dependency upon it seems to have been a universal characteristic of Byzantine religious thought. Clearly here there can be no appeal to biblical authority, but reference can be made to works which existed in one form or another from at least late antiquity,13 while other evidence, both literary and material (in the form of seals and amulets) shows that this tradition rests on notions which were current in Greece and the eastern Mediterranean from the Classical period and continued throughout the intervening centuries, developing and branching as they were transmitted over time.14 Given the limitations in the graphic depiction of demons indicated above as well as the source and nature of these beliefs it is perhaps not surprising to find that there are very few illustrations of the demons of popular belief surviving, although it is also apparent that such illustrations could and did exist. The female demons provide at least partial evidence for this fact, for a number of depictions of them have survived, though most are earlier than the period of concern in this paper or else are the result of internal developments or outside contacts which occur, as with other elaborations mentioned above, only from the sixteenth century onwards (Provatakis 1980:Eik. 98-101, 151-154, Pin. IA'). The classic scene illustrates a story in which this demoness is chased, captured and tormented in order to force her to give up the children she has stolen and to reveal her names so that men, by using them in an amulet, may have protection against her; normally the victor is named as St. Sisinnios or the Archangel Michael (Greenfield 1989). The depictions we have here are united in showing the demon as a female with long hair being speared or trampled by her conqueror, but in general they lack the more horrifying details which are ascribed to her in the literary descriptions and which evidently existed in the popular conception, such as the claws and burning eyes. One illustration of a clearly related, though differently named female survives in a 15th century magic text (Bononiensis 3632, f358); this is the 'Kale of the mountains' who is shown as a female, with long plaited hair, a crown, a thick coiling fish tail and clawed feet (Delatte 1927: 600; reproduced in Stewart 1991:171). Even more than the orthodox demonological beliefs, the conception and de 74</page><page sequence="15">piction of such popular beliefs are not to be considered solely in terms of their dependence on the historical and religious tradition which supports them. As well as this they also reflect individual and social notions of negative value and represent a personification of problems and misfortunes which apparently could not otherwise be dealt with on the purely human level. The female demon of the type described above thus may be seen to represent the complete opposite of the ideal Byzantine woman; she is unkempt, unruly, disobedient and powerful; she is cruel and harsh, so that instead of bearing and nurturing children she steals, sickens, murders and devours them; she is unchaste in her contact with men but instead of satisfying them sexually she mocks, deranges or kills them (cf. Stewart 1991:176f, but 107f). In addition this creature represents a personification of a number of ills and misfortunes which the standard orthodox tradition left without satisfactory ex planation and for which it thus provided no direct assistance. The extremely common problems and dangers of pregnancy, childbirth and infancy found, like all illness and misfortune, only a vague and largely unhelpful explanation in that tradition; they were, basically, the will of God sent to punish, test or for tify his people and they were thus to be escaped only by general prayer (which sought mercy but could command or enforce no action from the inscrutable de ity) and by an attempt to avoid or atone for the behaviour which might have brought down the divine punishment; it is true that intercession through the saints might be thought to assist in the process but in the end, they too could have no possible means of compelling relief if it was the will of God that someone should suffer or sicken. However, by personifying a particular problem or clus ter of problems, by attributing individuality and independent power to demonic beings the alternative traditions allowed a more psychologically, if perhaps not practically, satisfying explanation and course of action to be elaborated. Now it was the demon, characterised by all the appropriate negative values, which was itself to blame for the misfortune; in the general conceptual tradition such beings, though powerful, were by no means uncontrollable, and thus, provided that the sufferer or intercessor took the right steps (in terms of conduct and/or more detailed magical activity) and invoked (with appropriate inducements and reminders) the right spiritual power of good, the problem could be solved or avoided. In other words, the conception of such demonic beings allowed for the prospect of precise, automatic and immediate relief of a problem rather than the general, uncontrollable and often delayed assistance which was all that could be looked for within the confines of orthodox belief. For most people that was almost certainly the first option but, if it was perceived to have failed or the situation was becoming too urgent or frustrating, the looser concepts of belief in the alternative traditions at the popular, practical level could provide a possibly more satisfying choice (cf. Stewart 1991:223). 75</page><page sequence="16">Graphic depiction and overall conception of the powers of evil On a recent visit to Greece I saw in close succession two 'Byzantine' icons of St. Marina smiting the Devil. One, an antique of painted wood, was in the Byzantine Museum where it was displayed in isolation against a blank wall; the other, a cheap and faded card reproduction, was in a small wayside shrine near the village of Ayios Adrianos in the Argolid where it was propped up amidst the usual debris of lamp, incense grains, withered votive flowers, and a dusty beer bottle full of oil. I was struck by the sharp contrast in the context in which I saw these depictions of St. Marina* and, more importantly here, the Devil, and I feel that it illustrates in some way the point of this paper. At first sight it might just seem possible, given the fairly remote historical con text, to deal with the representation of the powers of evil in the later Byzantine world by a simple description of surviving graphic material. While that would indeed provide some interesting information concerning the artistic depictions of those powers, the understanding of such depictions which existed in the minds of those who produced and viewed them in their original context would be almost entirely lost; they would, in the final analysis, be little more than interesting pieces of 'art' to be set against a blank white wall and 'appreciated'. Clearly, a considerable extension of the study to include the wider context provided by the representation of the Devil and the demons in later Byzantine literature helps to prevent the artistic depictions from remaining isolated and devoid of real meaning. Even this, however, is still far from enough, for the whole tradition of representation, whether artistic or literary must be further placed as far as pos sible in its context within the overall conceptual tradition of the later Byzantines regarding the evil powers if the understanding of them that we have is ever to approach anything like its original depth. The field of representation must here be extended to include as wide a spectrum of later Byzantine society as surviving evidence allows, not just that of the dominant culture and religion, and there must, furthermore, be an attempt to recapture, in however limited a way, the entire mental range of images and associations which would have occurred to these people when they saw or read or heard of the evil powers. The Devil, and St. Marina, must be placed in the context of the wayside shrine as much as in the context of the museum. The constraints of space, if nothing else, means that this paper must inevitably fall far short of this goal in many respects, but I hope that I have at least set out in the right direction and shown something of the range and depth of possibility in this material. 76</page><page sequence="17">Notes 1. Although the Byzantine empire formally ceased to exist as a political entity in 1453 with the fall of Constantinople to the Turks, its cultural and religious life continued to play a very significant and, indeed, almost unaltered part in some areas of its former territory, particularly Greece. It is clearly in this sense that I refer to 'Byzantine' in the later 15th and 16th centuries. 2. The problem of defining 'the Byzantines' is a notoriously difficult one, as anyone familiar with this area of history will be aware and this is obviously not the place to tackle it in any depth; geographical, political, racial, linguistic and, especially in a context like the present one, even cultural and religious criteria are all inadequate by themselves. In the end one probably has to settle for a loose and inevitably somewhat unsatisfactory working definition based primarily on self-perception. In this paper I am thus referring in general to people who will in one way or another have seen themselves as Byzantine; it must be noted, however, that they themselves did not use this actual term, favouring instead Rhomaioi ('Romans'), and that this collective description itself was not necessarily employed in any exclusive or modern nationalistic sense. Geographically, in later Byzantine times, the majority of these people inhabited parts of western Asia Minor, areas bordering on the south-western Black Sea and the northern Aegean, and most of modern day Greece, although Byzantine political control over these areas was by no means coherent or continuous. Ethnically the Byzantines were predominantly Greek although there were many other groups, some of considerable size and influence, who have to be included; similarly they were united linguistically by a knowledge of Greek although a majority did not speak this exclusively and many not as their first language. Perhaps the greatest cohesion (and that of most significance here) will have been in terms of their perception of shared culture and religion; the Byzantines thus saw themselves as being united by their Orthodox Christianity and the vital sense of belonging to the empire or oikoumene of the Rhomaioi which was something much more than just a political entity or state. Even here, however, there were always significant divergences of religious opinion and there were very many important cultural subgroups, while common cultural and religious bonds extended over areas which bore little relationship to boundaries defined in other terms. Further on these questions see, e.g., Mango (1980:1-31). 3. Hopefully the usefulness of this exercise is reciprocal and may be seen, in part, as a response to the demand by some social anthropologists for a greater understanding of the depth and complexity of historical traditions (whether these survive in liter ary or graphic form) by those working on such societies as that of modern Greece and in areas such as 'popular' religion (Stewart 1991 :xvi, 13; Badone 1990:7; Morris 1986:1; and, for example, Lewis 1968:xv-xx). 4. While many of the points made by Lauwers in favour of this terminology also apply to the specifically Byzantine situation there are significant differences to that of western Europe. There was, for instance, considerably more 'secular' learning outside the confines of the church or relatively independent from it in the Byzantine world than in the medieval West, and indeed the whole notion of an hierarchical ecclesiastical control is absent there. The distinction between clerical and folkloric culture is thus helpful to the byzantinist but needs some adaptation. 5. On the study of mentalites in the context of medieval history see particularly Le Goff (1974). 77</page><page sequence="18">6. Stewart (1991:144f) thus points out that one may come into contact here with a dilemma in Christian doctrine for if the Devil is really believed to be immaterial then it must in some sense be contradictory to attempt to depict him in material form. This may explain the relatively slow rise of this particular iconographical tradition in general and its limitation especially in the more conservative Orthodox East. It also stresses the essentially symbolic nature of the generic representation in Byzantine art. 7. The only comprehensive study of the demonic in Byzantine art is Provatakis (1980); for convenience the reader is usually referred in the following pages to the many illustrations provided there. 8. Ducellier (1979:201) goes so fax as to argue that all such images of the Devil in Byzantine art denote a foreign influence, usually Latin. The attribution of any specific form (which presumably the 'generic' representation does not pretend to be) is alien to the Byzantine tradition. 9. Although at first sight this might seem to indicate a clear manifestation of racism in its equation of skin colour and evil this does not, in fact, appear to have been the case either for the later Byzantines or for the more ancient traditions they were following. Rather, such characteristic appearances have to do with the negative consequences of the fall from angelic light. Russell (1981:190-191) thus argues that the blackness of the Devil originally signified nothing but his emptiness. 10. The classic statement concerning both this ability and the real powerlessness on the part of the evil powers which it disguised was provided in the 4th century A.D. by St. Athanasios of Alexandria (Antony:28) who points out that beings with real power do not need to make use of fantasies and disguises designed to terrify their victims; the demons are merely weak and powerless actors. 11. Of considerable relevance here is Stewart's exploration of similar notions concerning the demonic beings known as exotika in the modern Greek context. As he says (1991:189) 'What this study [of the exotika] does reveal, through a kind of via negativa, is the nature of the society's values, for it is these that have stimulated the opposition of the exotika. The exotika could thus be said to reflect the very essence of social life. Far from being a residual, peripheral category - as their antithetical symbolism in some way suggests - they speak to the central concerns of Greek thought. They are a means by which Greek society may view its possibilities and contradictions, a task it must always undertake if it is to remain vital'; see further here Stewart (1991:139, 188-191, 249; 1985:39-40, 60-61). 12. Le Goff (1977c:339f) draws attention to the comparative slowness with which men tali tes change and to the 'epaves d'archeo-civilisations9 which they drag along with them. Nevertheless they are most definitely to be related to the contemporary historical situations in which they are being studied. 13. For example the Testament of Solomon, (McCown 1922). 14.
