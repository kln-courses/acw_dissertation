White, Michael W. Spence, Fred J. Longstaffe, Hilary Stuart-Williams, Kimberley R. Law This study addresses the political and military structure of early Teotihuacan through the analysis of oxygen-isotope ratios in skeletal phosphate from 41 victims of a sacrifice associated with the Feathered Serpent Pyramid. Oxygen-isotope ratios are markers of geographic identity. A comparison of bone and enamel values, which provides a contrast between environments experienced during growth and those of adulthood, illustrates that at least four different regions are represented in this sam- ple. Those identified as soldiers had either lived locally since childhood or had moved to Teotihuacan from severalforeign loca- tions. Most had lived in Teotihuacan for a prolonged period before their death. This pattern suggests foreign "recruitment" or mercenary behavior. The women had either lived all their lives in Teotihuacan or had movedfrom there to a foreign location. Most of the individuals in the center of the pyramid (burial 14) did not come from Teotihuacan, nor had they lived in the city long before their deaths. We suggest that the choice of victims was meant to demonstrate Teotihuacan's powerful ideology to the rest of the Mesoamerican world. Notably, this isotopic evidence of physical interaction between Teotihuacan and foreign regions considerably predates the currently existing archaeological evidence. En este estudio investigamos la estructura polftica y militar del estado temprano de Teotihuacan, Me'xico, por medio del analisis de las proporciones de los isotopos estables del oxfgeno en elfosfato oseo y dental de 41 vfetimas del gran sacrificio asociado a la construccion de la pira'mide de la Serpiente Emplumada en los anos 200AD. El ana'lisis se funda en la premisa de que "somos lo que bebemos". La proporcion isotopica del agua ambiental de una region se transfiere al agua corporal de quienes beben el agua y, entonces, a su fosfato oseo y dental. Asf, la proporcion de los isotopos sirve como un marcador geogra'fico. Adema's, una comparacion entre los valores dentales y oseos nos informa de la diferencia entre el ambiente geografico de la ninez y el ambi- ente de la vida adulta del individuo. Los resultados indican que al menos cuatro regiones estan representadas en la muestra. Los sacrificados identificados como soldados habfan vivido en el area de Teotihuacan desde su infancia o se trasladaron a Teotihua- can de areas fora'neas. La mayorfa habfa vivido en el area varios anos antes del sacrificio. Este patron sugiere el reclutamiento de extranjeros o quiza's el empleo de mercenarios. Las mujeres habfan pasado toda la vida en Teotihuacan o se trasladaron de Teotihuacan a a'reas fora'neas. En cambio, la mayor parte de los individuos masculinos del entierro 14, al centro de la pira'mide, no procedfa de Teotihuacan ni habfa vivido en el a'rea mucho tiempo antes de su muerte. Sugerimos que la seleccion de las vfeti- mas tuvo por objeto la demostracion de la poderosa ideologfa de Teotihuacan al mundo mesoamericano. Cabe destacar que esta evidencia isotopica de interaccion entre Teotihuacan y las a'reas fora'neas indica una fecha bastante ma's temprana para esta inter- accion que lo que la evidencia arqueologica muestra.

In addition, the city contained neighborhoods or barrios of people with foreign affinities (Gomez 1998; Rattray 1989,1990, 1993; Spence 1989, 1992). The degree of ethnic diversity and the nature of its preservation at Teoti- huacan are, however, unclear (Cowgill 1997). Among the many interpretive issues at the site are questions concerning its political structure, the extent of its influence outside the Basin of Mexico, and the role of the military in its internal functioning and in relation to other societies. All of these issues come together in analyses of data from the Feathered Ser- pent Pyramid, also known as the Temple of Quet- zalcoatl and referred to by Lopez Austin et al. (1991:93) as "Teotihuacan's most sumptuous mon- ument." The Feathered Serpent Pyramid is the third- largest pyramid in the city, next to the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, and was built during the Mic- coatli-Early Tlamililopa phases (A.D. 150-250) after the period of most rapid population growth had ceased. During the phase preceding that in which the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was constructed, there may have been a growing emphasis on ideology and religion (Cowgill 1992). The pyramid was con- structed near the plaza center of an enormous rec- tangular enclosure known as the Ciudadela. Located about 1 km south of the Pyramid of the Sun along the Avenue of the Dead, the Ciudadela is thought to have been the political and symbolic religious focus of the city (Cowgill 1983; Millon 1981, 1988). On the north and south sides of the pyramid are apart- ment compounds that are believed to have been the residences of Teotihuacan's rulers (Armillas 1964; Cowgill 1983; R. Millon 1973; Taube 1992). Recently, it has been suggested that the Ciudadela may have been symbolically associated with the underworld (Sugiyama 1993:110). Others suggest that, based on its construction and architecture, the Ciudadela represents a "new order"(Cowgill 1983; Millon 1988; Pasztory 1988).- The iconography from the facades of the Feath- ered Serpent Pyramid is the earliest found in situ that is related to high status (Cowgill 1992: 104) but, as with the Ciudadela, there are no images that refer- ence individuals (Pasztory 1988). Symbolic inter- pretations of the iconography include the myth of creation (Coe 1981; Coggins 1993), calendric suc- cession (Drucker 1974; Lopez Austin et al. 1991), rulership (Grove 1987; Taube 1992), an emphasis on "cosmic values" (Pasztory 1988), and war and the military (Carlson 1991; Sugiyama 1989, 1995; Taube 1992). It has long been recognized that Teotihuacan was not a peaceful society (C. Millon 1973; Millon 1976), but the timing of the rise of the military and its role and structure are still not clearly understood. During the phase preceding the rise of Teotihuacan (i.e., Tezoyuca phase 25&gt;150 B.C.), many sites in the Basin of Mexico were located in defensible positions, which led Sanders et al. (1979) to suggest that these polities were at war and that war may have played a role in the rise of the city. Cowgill (1992) suggests that military action may also have been involved in the city's rapid growth during the Patlachique phase (150 B.C.4). He also notes that the early emphasis on the military precedes its sym- bolic representation and that this representation increased over time. The most dramatic illustration of the military may have been found in the mass sac- rifice of 20s250 people that occurred as part of the construction of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Cabrera and Cabrera 1991; Cabrera and Serrano 1999; Cabrera et al. 1991; Sugiyama 1995). At the foot of the stairway and underneath the pyramid, there are three pits that might have contained the bodies of rulers but, because of looting, the identity and status of those interred in them cannot be ascer- tained. In addition to the discovery of over 20 indi- viduals with elaborate grave goods found at floor level in the central interior of the pyramid, there were many individuals dressed in military garb and accompanied by weapons, as well as separate buri- als of young females, all of whom were buried in symmetrical patterning inside and outside the pyra- mid. Determination of the nature of the military, as well as the rulership, may turn on the identity of these victims. Those in the central interior may have been bureaucrats or royal household retainers. Those associated with military symbols may have been enemi-es (foreign or domestic), royal guardsmen, or low-status Teotihuacanos dressed as soldiers (Cowgill 1992; Sugiyama 1995). Analyses of den- tal modification suggest that many of the sacrificed individuals may have been foreigners, perhaps from the Valley of Oaxaca or Maya regions (Serrano et al.1997). To address the issues surrounding the iden- tity of the sacrificial victims, we present analyses of oxygen-isotope ratios from a sample of these human remains.</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 219 Theoretical Background Oxygen-isotope data are a useful alternative to DNA analyses, in that they provide information on geo- graphic rather than genetic identities (White et al. 1998; 2000a; 2001). Anthropological interpretations of oxygen-iso- tope data from human skeletal remains are based on the assumptions that: 1) "we are what we drink," and 2) environmental variables create regional variabil- ity in oxygen-isotope ratios. Thus individuals who do not exhibit oxygen-isotope ratios typical of those who are defined archaeologically as local are likely to have come from another geographic area. Oxygen-isotope ratios (6180) are measured rela- tive to the VSMOW standard (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) and expressed in parts per thousand (%6) using the standard formula: ,^18 ( ° / ° sample- ° / ° standard ) ( ° / °standard ) The oxygen-isotope composition (618Op) of bio- genic phosphates, such as those found in bone and enamel, is known to reflect that of local precipita- tion water (bl8°w) (Longinelli 1984; Luz et al. 1984). The 6180 values of meteoric water are affected by climatic and geographic variables, such as tempera- ture, humidity, distance from the sea, and altitude, through the preferential loss of 160 as evaporation increases (Ayliffe and Chivas 1990; Yurtsever and Gat 1981). The oxygen-isotope composition of bio- genic phosphates is controlled by that of body water as these two phases equilibrate at a normal and con- stant body temperature. In turn, the oxygen-isotope composition of body water reflects the sources of oxygen consumed and the relative fluxes of oxygen- containing substances (e.g., vapor, sweat, urine, feces) into and out of the body. The dominant source of consumed oxygen is imbibed water (Longinelli and Peretti Paladino 1980), but other sources include organic matter and water contained in food, meta- bolic water derived from food, and atmospheric oxy- gen (Luz et al. 1984; Luz and Kolodny 1985). Although water in food is only a minor source of oxy- gen, imported foods could have bl8°w signatures that are different from local foods and create some variability in the oxygen-isotope values of local indi- viduals. However, in ancient populations, access to imported foods was most likely reserved for high- status individuals, and even then would likely have been a minor part of their diet. Among animals who eat and move seasonally, dietary heterogeneity and geographical movement can create significant variability in the 6180 values of skeletal phosphate (i.e., bl8Op) (Luz et al. 1990; Stuart-Williams and Schwarcz 1997), but generally the degree of natural intrapopulational variability in other wild species (deer, wild boar, pigs) and humans is low (1 %6) (Longinelli 1984), which makes the technique potentially very powerful for use in stud- ies in human migration. Species size, metabolic rate, and the relative influxes and outflows of oxygen- containing compounds, i.e., oxygen taken in versus lost through perspiration, breath vapor, urine and feces, also have an effect on bl8Op values (Bryant and Froelich 1995; Kohn 1996; Kohn et al. 1996). Because we are dealing with a single species, we assume these variables will have little effect. Intrapopulational variability estimated among other previously analyzed archaeological samples in Mesoamerica is higher than that found by Longinelli (1984), approximating 2 %O (White et al. 1998; 2000a; 2000b). This range is established by control groups that represent a variety of time periods and levels of social status, so the degree of intrasite vari- ability is expectedly higher and reflects the most con- servative basis for the identification of outliers or . forelgners. The tooth enamel and bone used in this study rep- resent the average isotopic composition of the body fluids during the period of mineralization. The 6180 values of body water are incorporated into these tis- sues during the process of mineralization (Luz et al. 1984). In teeth, the mineralization of enamel only occurs when the crown of the tooth is being formed. Teeth form in a well-defined sequence from approx- imately S months in utero to approximately 15 years old (Massler et al. 1941; Ubelaker 1978) Thus the oxygen-isotope signature of enamel will reflect the local environment during the formation period of a particular tooth. The potential for enamel to demon- strate environmentally based shifts in 6180 values has been shown recently in several ways incIuding the detection of seasonality in a variety of mammals (Cerling and Sharp 1996; Fncke and O'Neil 1996; Stuart-Williams and Schwarcz 1997), and the tim- ing of weaning in humans (White et al.2000a; Wright and Schwarcz 1996). Unlike enamel, bone remodels. However, the rela-</page><page sequence="4">220 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 2, 2002] tionship between bone turnover and the incorpora- tion of water 6180 values into bone phosphate, par- ticularly in adults, is poorly understood. It has been suggested that oxygen-isotope signatures incorpo- rated into bone phosphate during the main period of mineralization (i.e., childhood and early adulthood) should be sustained over the long term (Leonard and Scullin 1969; Luz et al. 1984), and it is also logical that children and adolescents will manifest new oxy- gen-isotope signatures in their bones more quickly than adults because they are still in the main period of mineralization and their rate of bone turnover is much higher. The principles of incorporation of environmental elements into the skeleton during its development and later tissue maintenance have also been applied using strontium isotope ratios to reconstruct geographic relocation of individuals at Teotihuacan (Price et al. 2000). Strontium isotope ratios originate in local geology and are passed on to human bone and tooth enamel via foods consumed. Using this approach, Price et al. (2000) found that migration to the city was significant. People in some neighborhoods (e.g., the Oaxaca Barrio, Cueva de las Varillas, Oztoy- ahualco 15B:N6W3, and the Merchants' Barrio) appear to have come from a variety of different places, and many had lived in Teotihuacan for a sig- nificant amount of time before death. This is con- sistent with previous oxygen-isotope analyses for samples from the Oaxaca Barrio (White et al.1998) and the Merchant's Barrio (White et al. 2000c). Strontium isotope analysis has not yet been done for the Feathered Serpent samples. Sample Description The first excavation of the Feathered Serpent Pyra- mid uncovered burials of an individual at each cor- ner (Dosal 1925) (Figure 1). In 1939, Perez excavated at the foot of the stairway finding fragmentary human bone and rich grave offerings (see Cabrera et al. 1991). However, the scale and symmetry of the human sacrifice was not understood until excavations in the early 1980s resulted in an estimate of over 200 victims, most of whom were male (Cabrera and Cabrera 1991; Sugiyama 1989,1995). Although not all of the sacrificial victims have been excavated yet, further excavations are not anticipated in the near future, since the remaining burials are beneath the pyramid. The focus of this sample description will be on the burials and groupings that were sampled. Although we did not have access to all of the skele- tons from the pyramid, we did manage to sample most of the major groups that had been excavated. During the 198s82 excavation, the composite grave of 18 males (Burial 190) was found along the southern exterior of the pyramid. These individuals were seated facing outward from the pyramid with their arms behind their backs and crossed at the wrists. Accompanying them were many obsidian projectile points, several thousand pieces of worked shell, shell imitations of human maxillae, several real human maxillae and mandibles, and slate disks (that likely held pyrite mirrors) resembling those pic- tured in artistic representations of Teotihuacan (and later) soldiers (Cabrera et al. l991). This same mor- tuary pattern is also found at the east and north exte- rior and in the southern interior of the pyramid. Cabrera et al. (1991) argue that the youth (mostly late teens and twenties) and sex (male) of the indi- viduals, the weapons and accoutrements (maxillae and disks), the absence of ceramics, and their posi- tioning as guardians identify them as soldiers (see also Serrano et al. 1991). The symmetry of these groupings is only slightly disturbed on the east exte- rior by a narrow trench that transects the linear graves along the east-west axis. Our sampling of soldiers includes three from the south exterior grave (Burial 190), seven from the south interior grave (Burial 4), six from the east exterior grave north of the east-west trench (Burial 5), and four from south of the east- west trench (Burial 6). Another male, Burial 1, was alone in a grave on the north side and was not wear- ing military accoutrement (Sugiyama 1995). In parallel linear graves located in front of all of the above groupings, there are groups of eight females who have poorer offerings and range in age from 13 to 34 years. Of these groups we have sam- pled four from the south interior (Burial 2), two from the east exterior grave north of the east-west trench (Burial 10), and two from south of the east-west trench (Burial 11). None were available forthe north and south exterior graves. In 1988-89 the interior of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was excavated by Sugiyama (1989, 1993, 1995). In the course of building a tunnel from the southern end of the pyramid he discovered in the southern interior linear graves described above (Buri- als 2 and 4) as well as looters' tunnels leading to two looted pit burials (Burials 12 and 13). A sample from the unlooted fill from each of the pit burials was</page><page sequence="5">* . . . . . REPORTS 221 5 0 010 g 011 6 190| l o s 10 , . . 24 30 40 m . . . Figure 1.

The individual from Burial 12 was part of a multiple burial and is a male who had his hands tied behind his back and was most likely a sacrifice. Burial 13 is thought to have con- tained as many as 18-20 high-status sacrificed indi- viduals (Sugiyama 1995:118), but was not a royal burial with sacrificed retainers (Sugiyama 1995: 110, 116). The individual from Burial 13 analyzed here, (13E), was very robust and had high-quality orna- ments, i.e., large greenstone earspools, 21 green- stone beads, a Tlaloc nose pendant, and an obsidian eccentric blade (Sugiyama 1995:110). Most of the sacrifices in Burial 13 had been disturbed by loot- ers, but 13E was in an undisturbed area of the grave and peripheral to the other members. A carved wooden baton, which was part of the original offer- ing, was found in disturbed fill. It is reminiscent of scepters carried by a Maya ruler shown on stela 26 from Piedras Negras and recovered from the cenote at Chichen Itza, which may suggest foreign affinity of the occupant(s) in Burial 13. In the center of the pyramid, there is an oval- shaped mass grave (Burial 14) a little larger than that of Burial 13. It contains 20 adult males laid out in a fairly symmetrical fashion at ground level (unlike the other pit burials) along the east-west axis. Sugiyama (1995:132) believes that the occupants of Burial 14 are similar in status to those of Burial 13 and per- haps Burial 12. Most have theirhands crossed behind their backs. Although their position in death indicates sacrifice, they are accompanied by the richest offer- ings yet found at the site, including 400 greenstone objects (earspools, nose pendants, figurines, beads), obsidian tools, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, worked and unworked shell, slate disks, worked wood, plants, seeds, and the remains of tex- tiles (Cabrera et al. 1991). Some offerings are asso- ciated with specific individuals, but the majority were laid on top of the group with no regard to particular individuals (Cabrera et al. 1991:86). Cabrera et al. (1991) argue that because of the general distribution of these offerings, there is no individual who stands</page><page sequence="6">222 LATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 2, 2002l The reproducibility of the 6180 values obtained using the Ag3PO4 precipitations and the procedure for oxygen extraction was assessed with repeat analy- ses of the standard Aldrich Ag3PO4 (No. 33, 738-2) (mean 6180 value = 10.8 + .3 %O n = 137). Dupli- cate precipitations of Ag3PO4 are reproducible to + .3 %O, n = 25 pairs). Previous analysis of bone from Teotihuacan has indicated that postmortem alteration, or diagenesis, has not affected the 6180 values of bone phosphate (Stuart-Williams et al. 1998). Although enamel should be less likely to be altered in a burial envi- ronment because it is better crystallized during for- mation and has a lower organic content (Bryant et al. 1996; Quade et al. 1992; Reinhard et al. 1996), we cannot rule out the possibility that recrystalliza- tion or dissolution of the phosphate could have occurred (Bryant et al.1994; McArthur and Herczeg 1990; Shemesh et al. 1983). Phosphate can be sub- stituted by carbonate in the mineral (bioapatite) struc- ture of enamel (Elliot 1997). The presence of such substitution is commonly quantified by the Crys- tallinity Index (CI), which is calculated using car- bonate and phosphate absorbances produced using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometry (Shemesh 1990): out as a ruler. Therefore, the offerings constitute a "ritual symbol set" and should be considered col- lectively to represent the status of those who buried them, rather than as a reflection of the victims' sta- tus in life. We have sampled seven of the individu- als in this mass grave. Forty-one individuals are represented by bone samples in this analysis. Samples were selected on the basis of accessibility, representing the burial groups as broadly as possible, and concern for main- taining the integrity of the collection by not destroy- ing material that might be needed for future analyses. The majority of those sampled were males (33), as were the majority of the sacrifices. Teeth were also sampled for 28 of these same individuals and for two individuals for whom no bone was available. The enamel analyzed from these teeth represents the envi- ronment in which the individual lived during the for- mation of the crowns. The representation of tooth types varies because of pre- and postmortem loss. Teeth analyzed include canines (forming between 6 months and 4 years), premolars (forming between 2 and 6 years), first molars (forming between 6 months and 3 years), second molars (forming between 3 and 7 years), and third molars (forming between 9 and 12 years). Analytical Procedure Bone was processed and analyzed in the stable iso- tope laboratory at McMaster University (Stuart- Williams et al. 1998), and enamel at the stable isotope laboratory at The University of Western Ontario. To remove calcium and organic material, bone and enamel (approximately 3s35 mg) were dissolved and processed using several chemical intermediaries (lead phosphate, lead sulphate) (see Stuart-Williams and Schwarcz 1995). Silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4) was isolated and precipitated by ammo- nia volatilization using Firsching's (1961) method. To extract oxygen from the Ag3PO4, the samples were reacted with bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) at 600° C for 2 16 hours, and then converted to CO2 over red-hot graphite, using a procedure similar to that of Clayton and Mayeda (1963) and Crowson et al. (1991). The Ag3PO4 produced an average yield of CO2 (4.6 + .2 pmoles/mg) that is very close to the theoretical yield (4.7 pmoles/mg) (Table 1). The oxy- gen-isotope measurements were made using a dual- inlet, triple-collecting, gas-source, stable isotope ratio mass-spectrometer. CI - (A565 + A605)/ A595 whereA represents absorbances at 565cm-1 (V4 P04), 605cm-1 (V4 P04), and 595cm-1 which is the valley between these two peaks. In order to test for any sys- tematic relationship between CIand 6180 values that could indicate postmortem recrystallization, CI val- ues were obtained for all but one sample of enamel (14-S). The CI data were obtained following stan- dard methods using a Nicolet 205 FTIR and data- processing software. Results Diagenesis The Feathered Serpent Pyramid bone samples have an average CI of 4.0 + .4, and the enamel samples have an average CIof 3.3 + .3 (Table 1). If the orig- inal biogenic 6180 values had been diagenetically altered by recrystallization, one would expect them to correlate with CI values.

Phosphate Oxygen-Isotope Values for Bone and Enamel for Burials from the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (continued). 29). Similarly, a correlation of 6180 values with phos- phate yield (Ag3PO4) would be expected to demon- strate a problem with precipitations; for example, low yields could mean one isotope (160 or 180) is being recovered preferentially. Again, no statistically sig- nificant correlations were found (forbone, Pearson's r = -.033, n = 22; for enamel, Pearson's r = .246, n = 29). Intersite variability Breastfeeding is the apparent cause of an approxi- mate +.7 %O trophic level effect in the 6180 values of both enamel carbonate (Wright and Schwarcz 1998, 1999) and enamel phosphate (White et al. 2000a). Breast milk is rich in 180 so breastfeeding children have higher 6180 values than adults or children that are fully weaned. Based on estimates derived from bl5N analyses of bone and enamel, and frequencies of linear enamel hypoplasia at other Mesoamerican sites (Dolphin 2000; Song 1-997; Williams 2000; Wright and White 1996), we assume that most chil- dren would have been weaned by age 3 to 4 years. The canines and first molars dominantly represent preweaning phosphate formation. In order to avoid the confounding effect of breastfeeding, all 6180 val- ues for these teeth have been lowered by .7 %6. Sec- ond and third molars, which are formed mainly after completion of weaning, require no adjustment to their 6180 values. Premolars, however, contain both pre- and postweaning enamel. To be conservative, we have chosen to adjust the 6180 values downward by .35 %O to ensure the preweaning enamel does not introduce bias into the data . All of the bone samples come from adolescents or adults, and hence no adjustment to their 6180 val- ues is needed. All but two of these samples are tra- becular bone (Table 1), which generally has a much faster turnover rate than cortical bone (i.e., approx- imately 26 percent per year compared to 2.9 percent per year; Parfitt 1983). Depending on the time elapsed between the formation of the tooth analyzed and the death of the individual, and the age of relo- cation, the bone of individuals who had relocated would be in various stages of re-equilibration to 6180 values typical of Teotihuacan. The site of Tlajinga 33 (Storey 1992) provides a baseline for 6180 values typical of local Teotihua- canos. Tlajinga 33 is a local apartment compound of fairly low-status individuals that is located in the southern part of the city (mean 6180 = 15.0 + .5 %O for bone, range = 14.3-15.9 %6). A recent analysis suggests that females at Tlajinga 33 exhibit markedly greater variability than males (White et al. 2000b). This pattern would be common in a patrilocal resi- dential pattern that has been found at La Ventilla B in Teotihuacan (Sempowski and Spence 1994). To avoid possible confounded variability caused by females who may have moved from other areas, we</page><page sequence="9">Table 2.

REPORTS 225 have restricted our control sample to males (n = 9). Notably, modern teeth from Mexico City, which is also located in the Basin of Mexico, have a phos- phate 6180 value of 15 %O (Levinson et al.1987). The Teotihuacan environment is isotopically distinct from the following areas that are known archaeologically to have had connections with the ancient city (Fig- ure 2). For example, bone phosphate from Monte Alban, in theValley of Oaxaca, has a mean 6180 value of 13.0 + .6 %O (n = 16, range 12.1-13.9 %6) (White et al.1998), and enamel from Kaminaljuyu, in high- land Guatemala, has a mean 6180 value of 16.7 + .7 %0 (n = 30, range 15.6-17.7 %6) (White et al.2000a). There may be some overlap in 6180 values between Kaminaljuyu and Teotihuacan, but this could be a consequence of the inclusion of some foreign-born individuals in both samples (White et al. 2000a; 2000b). The 6180 values from Kaminaljuyu are also similar to bone from Tzintzuntzan near Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan (range 16.2-16.9 %6). Sam- ples of bone from lowland Maya regions have much higher 6180 values relative to Teotihuacan. For exam- ple, samples from Rio Azul and Rio Bravo in the Guatemalan Peten have a mean 6180 value of 19.9 + .7 %O (n = 7, range 18.3-20.4 %6; White et al. 2000a), and those from Altun Ha have a mean of 18.7 _ .6 %O (n = 5, range 17.8-19.5 %O) (White et al. 2001). Notably, most of these sites exhibit a natural range of isotopic variability around 2 %6. We caution that other Mesoamerican sites not yet sampled may have means and ranges of 6180 values similar to those above. Nonetheless, the altitudinal and climatic differences among the sites examined do generally correlate with their 6180 signatures (Table 2). The amount of variability within sites also deserves comment (Figure 2). The ranges in 6180 val- ues for control samples from each site used for com- parison are approximately 2 %6. We consider this to be an estimate of the degree of natural variation that could be expected within archaeological communi- ties. Such variation could be caused by seasonality, movement between local microenvironments, and the inclusion of high-status individuals who con- sumed significant quantities of imported foods with high water content. Although we do not yet have con- trol data for a group of modern individuals who resided all their lives in one place imbibing water from the same source(s) and eating similar foods, we expect that the range would be narrower. To be con- servative, the range of 6180 values we have defined here to represent local Teotihuacan residence is 14.s16.0 %6. Geographical Afminities of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid Burials Interpretations of the origins of the sacrificial vic- tims in the Feathered Serpent Pyramid are made in the context of the range of 6180 values found at Teoti- huacan and the variability that exists among the sites described above. Where bone and tooth samples have both been analyzed for the same individual, we assume that the bone values represent the region of most recent residence, or some degree of equilibra- tion to that region, depending on the time in residence there and the bone analyzed. The following obser- vations indicate that a remarkable amount of relo- cation had occurred in this sample. First, there is no statistically significant correlation between bone and enamel 6180 values of individuals (Pearson's r = -.14, n = 28). The difference in 6180 values between bone and enamel l/\18°bone enamel | (or 1/\18°b el ) ranges between .1 and 6.7 %6(mean = 2.12 + 1.83 (Table 1). Only two values for l/\l80b el fall below the analyti- cal error for precision of .3 %O defined earlier for this method, so the majority of individuals for whom both bone and enamel were sampled had relocated. Some had moved to dramatically different environ- ments.

(Bars represent range of 6180 values.) alone could explain this degree of variation. Diets involving a high proportion of imported foods with high water content could create anomalous values, but such foods are unlikely to have been imported in great quantity because of their weight. Second, there is no significant correlation between age at death and IA'80b el, which indicates considerable variabil- ity in the amount of time individuals had spent in their new environments. The Soldiers and the Females We begin with the oxygen-isotope data for the sol- diers and the females (Table 1, Figure 3). The lone male individual from the north exterior grave (Bur- ial 1), who probably is not a soldier, appears to be local (8180 = 15.8 %o) as do the 5 soldiers from the grave (Burial 190) along the south exterior of the pyramid (6180 = 14.2-16.1 %o; Figure 3a, soldiers). A comparison of bone and canine tooth enamel from one soldier (Burial 190-F) indicates that he had lived in Teotihuacan at least since he was about 6 months old (6180 = 15.3-15.5 %o respectively, Table 1). The grave of soldiers (Burial 4) along the south- ern interior of the pyramid provides some contrast (Figure 3c, soldiers). Data from the bones of most of the soldiers from this grave indicate that they had all been living in Teotihuacan for some time (6180 = 15.6-16.2 %o). The enamel from their teeth, how- ever, tells a more complex story. With the exception of one of these individuals (4A), all of these soldiers had grown up in foreign locations (6180 = 11.4-17.8 %o). Furthermore, there are two extremely divergent foreign regions represented in this group. One group comprises soldiers (4E and 4L) who came from an environment reflected by very low 6180 values (mean = 11.6 %o), which is unlike any other Meosamerican site yet analyzed. The other group (4C, 4N, 40) has 6180 values consistent with those from highland Guatemala (mean = 17.3 %o). The women who were placed in a separate grave (Burial 2) in front of the soldiers from Burial 4 show a different pattern (Figure 3a, b, d, females). Analy- ses of their enamel indicates that half were born locally (2A, 2G) and half in a foreign location (2C, 22 .. I .. I * . II . * . II . I II . . *** . ** ... I**I . ... . . .

The 2C female has a 6180 value consistent with those from the Valley of Oaxaca and the value of the 2H female is consistent with either Michoacan or highland Maya signatures. The more recent residence of the women ana- lyzed, as reflected in their bone 6180 values, indi- cates that only one (2A) likely spent most of her life in one area, i.e., Teotihuacan. The other three women from Burial 2 (2C, 2G, 2H) appear to have moved after the formation of their teeth to at least two dif- ferent foreign locations. One of these (2G) was born locally according to her 6180 enamel value, but her 6180 bone value is near the high end of the range for local Teotihuacan values. Notably, her bone sample was cortical and therefore had a slow turnover rate. She was also only 17-19 years old, and therefore had only 5-10 years for isotopic re-equilibration of bone oxygen to occur. In cortical bone, this would repre- sent a maximum of 30 percent turnover (assuming her tooth erupted with 6180 values at the lowest end of the range, her death occurred at the highest pos- sible age, and that she moved immediately after the formation of her tooth). Therefore it is probable that she was still in the process of equilibrating isotopi- cally with a new non-Teotihuacan environment described by still higher b'80 values. Another woman (2C) has the highest 6180 bone value in the data set (19.7 %6), which is consistent with a lowland, per- haps coastal, environment. The individual 2H has a bone 6180 value (17.0 %6) that, when compared to her enamel value (17.8 %6), could be reflecting equi- libration to aregion that is less enriched in 6180 (pos- sibly Teotihuacan).

Any symbolic or functional rea- son for the separation of these graves is unknown. No distinct geographic origins are apparent from the oxygen-isotope compositions of the individuals in Burials 5 and 6 that would account for the split (Table 1, Figures 3 and 4). Bone 6180 values indicate that all but two individuals (6I, 5E) had lived for some time in Teotihuacan. Among Burial 5, the individual 5E stands out as coming from a foreign location. In this case, that location appears to have been in the lowlands, perhaps coastal. Among Burial 6, there is one individual (6I) who has a bone value consistent with the Valley of Oaxaca. However, like the soldiers along the southern interior of the pyramid, the 6180 values of the enamel of soldiers from the eastern exterior indicate that, for the majority, the childhood years had been spent in other locations. Only two individuals (5H and 6B) appear to have spent all of their lives in Teotihuacan. This result is intriguing</page><page sequence="13">REPORTS 229 for soldier 5H because he had been considered a for- eigner based on his high degree of cranial modifica- tion and his small size (Cabrera et al. 1991). Most of the others who had moved to Teotihuacan from foreign locations have 6180 enamel values (range 16.3 to 17.5 %s) consistent with the Guatemalan highlands or Michoacan. One individual (5C) has a higher 6180 enamel value (18.2 %s) that falls within the range of the lowland locations. The two females sampled from the grave (Bur- ial 10) that lies in front of the soldiers in Burial 5 have bone 6180 values indicating local residence (Table 1, Figure 3a,4). There is only one tooth ana- lyzed from the females in this group. The enamel 6180 value (15.8 %O) from this individual (1OA) lies within the range defined for Teotihuacan, but her bone value (14.3 %s) is at the other end of that range, which could suggest relocation, possibly within the Basin of Mexico. The two females from Burial 11, which is located in front of the soldiers on the south side of the east- west axis (Burial 6), have similar 6180 bone values (14.1 and 13.6 %s). We suggestthey resided for some time in the same location, possibly the same loca- tion in which the majority of Burial 6 soldiers (6C, 6D,6I) lived (Figure 4). However, because their 6180 values lie between the high end of the range for the Valley of Oaxaca and the low end for Teotihuacan, this location is difficult to pinpoint. The Central Interior We first examine the data for individuals from the two looted pits (Burials 12,13E) (Table 1, Figure 5). The individual representing the multiple interments in Burial 12 has a bone 6180 value that indicates he was local. He had been sacrificed as part of the large ritual during the construction period of the pyramid. Burial 13E, who was also thought to have been sac- rificed (Sugiyama 1995:110,234-235), has very sim- ilar 6180 enamel (16.5 %s) and bone (16.4 %s) values that indicate his residence in the same area in which he was raised. These results lie beyond the high end of the range of 6180 values expected for Teotihua- can and hence could be consistent with a foreign loca- tion, e.g., the Guatemalan highlands or Michoacan (Figures 2 and 5). Because the 6180 values overlap with those from the Guatemalan highlands, and because the fill of this grave contained a carved wooden baton resembling a "manikin sceptre carried by Maya rulers" (Cabrera et al. 1991), it is possible that 13E was indeed a high-status Maya individual even though the baton was not directly associated with his body. His signature is also like that from Bur- ial 15 (6180 = 16.3 %0), an individual who was found below the floor of the pyramid and believed to have been a sacrifice associated with architecture that pre- dates the construction of the pyramid. None of the bone 6180 values from the individu- als in the large grave (Burial 14) indicate local adult residence. Most results (16.3-17.7 %0) are consis- tent with either highland Guatemalan or Michoacan values. The two outliers (14A, 14K) have similar bone 6180 values that are consistent with lowland or coastal regions (see Figure 2). Again, the enamel 6180 values add complexity to the geographical iden- tities of the sacrificial victims in Burial 14. All but three (14A,14R,14S) of these individuals also lived in foreign locations during their childhoods, but only two (14C,14I) grew up in the locale where they lived later in life. Some individuals experienced very dra- matic geographical displacement. For example, indi- vidual 14A appears to have spent his childhood in Teotihuacan, but moved to the lowlands or coast, which resulted in a 4 %0 shift in his 6180 values. Indi- vidual 14F grew up in an unknown location similar to that indicated by the enamel from some of the Bur- ial 4 soldiers (4E,4L) and then moved to an area con- sistent with that of the Guatemalan highlands or Michoacan. The shift in his 6180 values is even more dramatic at 6.5 %0. It is also interesting that all the individuals sampled from the more peripheral loca- tions of Burial 14 (i.e., 14A, C, K) had lived more recently in a different location (perhaps lowland or coastal) than those more centrally placed in the group (Burials 14F, I, R, S) (Figure 5). Discussion The oxygen isotopic data for the groups of individ- uals identified as soldiers may be used to address issues regarding the nature of the military in Teoti- huacan. Let us discuss first the graves on the interior and exterior peripheries of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, which contain the men thought to have been soldiers. If all of these individuals were indeed soldiers, the military structure of the state must have been multiethnic because of the large proportion of individuals who have foreign signatures. It has been suggested that the men in these graves may have been foreign captives (Serrano et al.1997). However, it is reasonable to expect that foreign cap-</page><page sequence="14"> 230 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 2, 2002] Burial 12 Burial 13 Burial 14 (central-F,I,R,S) Burial 14 ( peripheral -A,C , K) Burial 15 o o o cT o o o o o oo o cE o l E w | w l w w | g l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l 10 1 1 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 6 18 o (%o, VSMoW) Figure 5. The 6l80 values of enamel (g) and bone (0) phosphate from the burials in the center of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid. tives should show no evidence of dwelling in Teoti- huacan. Instead, we find that, although there are many foreign signatures in this data set, of the 15 sacrifices for whom there are both bone and enamel data, only 1 individual (5E, who was 25-29 years old) may never have lived at Teotihuacan for very long (Figure 3). The other 14 sacrifices with bone and enamel values who have been identified as sol- diers fall into different residence patterns, all of which could reflect military membership (Figure 3). Some individuals (n = 4) appear to have spent all their lives in the city. The majority (n = 9) have bone 6180 val- ues indicating that they had come from some foreign location and lived at Teotihuacan for a considerable time before their death. Burials 4 and 5 are particu- larly good examples of this pattern of movement. Only one (6I) had grown up locally and moved away. These residence patterns indicate that, in addition to the possibility of having a locally based military career, the state probably also engaged in regionally interactive recruitment. Given the relatively young age of the males in this sample and the assumption that considerable time is needed for bone 6180 val- ues to re-equilibrate isotopically to a new environ- ment, we speculate that recruitment might frequently have occurred in early adolescence. It is possible that some of these soldiers may have moved with their parents to Teotihuacan in childhood or adoles- cence as part of the rapid expansion of the city at that time, and later entered the military. If these soldiers are representative of Teotihuacan military member- ship in general, then it would appear that the major- ity were foreign-born recruits. This part of the membership could be a result of military service by a broadly based Teotihuacan elite, state press-gang action, state-required tribute labor, or mercenary enlistment. Any state that relies most heavily on non- local military strength could, however, make itself vulnerable to political collapse. Alternately, the num- ber of foreign soldiers among the sacrificial victims may not be a proportionate representation of Teoti- huacan military membership. However, if the selec- tion of foreign-born soldiers for sacrifice was used to demonstrate the geographical spheres influenced</page><page sequence="15">REPORTS 231 or controlled by the state, then one might have expected the soldiers to have been grouped by region of origin. There is no clear evidence for this in our data. Although they have come from at least four dif- ferent regions, the burial groupings cannot be sorted easily by area of origin. For example, at least three regions of origin are represented among burial 4 sol- diers alone. The evidence for deployment of local soldiers to foreign locations is not as strong as the evidence of recruitment of foreigners, but at least one individual (6I) grew up locally and moved away. In this case, the move was to a location with an environment like the Valley of Oaxaca. We might speculate that he was a child of a Teotihuacano in foreign residence who was recruited into the army of his homeland or per- haps a Teotihuacan soldier who served abroad in a long-term capacity such as an embassy guard. The contrast in the number of soldiers who had been recruited abroad relative to those that may have been deployed abroad may shed some light on the nature of Teotihuacan state control over various regions of Mesoamerica. Cowgill (1997) suggests that Teoti- huacan's administrative control did not extend much beyond the Basin of Mexico and that, rather than attempting to control large blocks of territory, Teoti- huacan probably used strategic foci of control to pro- tect its interests. This likely involved control or influence on key settlements and routes between them. Among the areas known to have had a con- nection with Teotihuacan are the Valley of Oaxaca, the Tula region in Hidalgo, Matacapan in Veracruz, Mirador in Chiapas, Rio Azul, Tikal and Kami- naljuyu in Guatemala, andAltun Ha in Belize (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982; Kidder et al.1946; Pender- gast 1971). The large spread of oxygen isotopic val- ues among the soldiers does indeed indicate an interaction with an extremely wide range of envi- ronments, which likely reflects the sphere of Teoti- huacan's interests. Although there was some interaction between Teotihuacan and the Maya world that was contem- poraneous with the construction period of the tem- ple (Pendergast 1971), Cowgill (1997) notes that most of the archaeological evidence for Teotihua- can's foreign influence postdates A.D.300. The tim- ing of the construction and sacrifice at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid atA.D.150-250 (probably notlong after A.D. 200), therefore, either predates or comes at the juncture of Teotihuacan's "expansionist" period. The oxygen isotopic evidence for foreign birth among the sacrificed soldiers indicates foreign interactions that were probably already fairly well established with at least four regions. Although we suggest possible locations of origin for some foreign regions based on 6180 values obtained from Maya lowland and highland regions outside Mexico, it is also possible that the foreign signatures found among the sacrifices represent origins in other Mexican loca- tions as well. For example, Tzintzuntzan has 6180 values that overlap with Kaminaljuyu (Figure 2) and coastal Veracruz might have 6180 values similar to the coastal Maya lowlands. Much more sampling of sites will be required before Mesoamerica can be mapped isotopically and interpretations can be more firmly grounded. There is far more isotopic evidence for recruit- ment than deployment, which might suggest that military force may not have been the dominant form of Teotihuacan's imperialism. Rather, the power of its political prestige may have had a stronger base in both ideology and economics. If widespread force or tribute were motives for the recruitment of sol- diers, one might expect to find greater evidence of deployment of local soldiers, who would be neces- sary for enforcement of the state mandate in foreign lands. However, soldiers deployed abroad eithermay not have been easily available for sacrifice, or their period of foreign deployment may not have been long enough to change their 6180 values significantly. In the future, we will further examine the issue of deployment by analyzing teeth from the dental col- lars worn by some of the soldiers, i.e., the victims of the victims. Regardless of the issue of deployment, the recruit- ment model derived from the results indicates sub- stantial foreign involvement. A model of voluntary or mercenary service may have prevailed where the prestige of the city and promise of reward may have attracted young men to state military service. Of course, it is possible that either our sample is unrep- resentative of those sacrificed, or the selection of sacrificial victims was unrepresentative of military structure. Given the ideological significance of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Lopez Austin et al. 1991), it is tempting to believe that the separate graves of the foreign-born soldiers represented dif- ferent military units or legions. Although this could well be the case, there is so much oxygen isotopic variability within each grave that it is unlikely that</page><page sequence="16">232 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 2, 2002] the graves represented separate ethnic units associ- ated with specific homelands. Rather, it appears that the militaIy corps were multiethnic, also containing members from Teotihuacan. This kind of structure would better serve the interests of the state in terms of inhibiting ethnic-based internal revolt. Most of the sacrificial victims were probably selected from locally existing groups. Certainly there is isotopic and archaeological evidence that residents of some areas of Teotihuacan had emigrated from elsewhere (Gomez 1998; Price et al. 2000; White et al. 1998; 2000c). One might speculate that the desire to rep- resent a diversity of military units may have been a factor in the selection of the victims. The sacrifice could have included a defined number of individu- als from each military unit loosely analogous to the Roman practice of decimation, i.e., killing of one in ten members of each military unit as a punishment for failure. In contrast to the residence patterning of the sol- diers, none of the women in the graves fronting them have 6180 values indicating movement from a for- eign location to Teotihuacan (Figure 3). Although two women (2C, 2H) appear not to have lived in Teotihuacan at all, three (2A, 2G, 10A) spent their chil&amp;oodslocally (Table 1). Ofthoseeightforwhom we have bone values, reflecting post-childhood res- idence, four were local and four foreign. In terms of their movement, one may have moved from Teoti- huacan (2G) to another location, and two (2C, 2H) moved from one foreign location to another. It is, therefore, unlikely that the women could be gener- ally categorized as "exotic" concubines or captives brought from foreign lands. Given the small sample size for this group it is impossible to make a defini- tive interpretation about their social position or rela- tion to the soldiers. Nonetheless, because the majority grew up locally, their movement likely was dictated by the movement or location of men with whom they became associated. That is, they might have been wives or concubines who moved with their men, or they may have been sent away for the purpose of mamage. The existence of one woman (2C) who grew up in a foreign location and moved to a different one is interesting in that there was also one soldier (SE) in a distinct location who exhibited this pattern. Although these two probably lived most recently in the same region, they did not grow up in the same place. It is unclear whether there are individual rela- tionships between the groups of women and their associated groups of men. There is a good corre- spondence of bone 6180 values between most males (Burials 5 and 6) and females (Burials 10 and 11) on the east exterior of the pyramid (Figure 4). This sug- gests that some could have been mates even though they did not all grow up in the same area. However, among the 6180 values of bone for the male and female groups from the south interior graves (Buri- als 4 and 2), the females exhibit considerably more variability than the males. In this location, the resi- dence patterns of the soldiers and those of the women also contrast. The bone 6180 values of the soldiers are quite uniform, indicating that the majority lived most recently in the same place, probably Teotihua- can or the Valley of Mexico. The 6180 values of the women, however, indicate a variety of more recent residence locations, only one of which was local. It appears that the women sampled in Burial 2 were not mates to the men in Burial 4, or at least they had not lived in the same place together in recent years. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the lack of correspondence in the more recent dwelling locations (i.e., bone 6180 values) is due to sampling error. The females are also quite young and could be fairly recent brides who married into the local group from outside, their 6180 values not having had time to equilibrate to their new home. The occupants of the central interior of the pyra- mid demonstrate residence patterning that is differ- ent again from that of the soldiers and women (Figures 3 and 5). The only individual who appears to have lived recently in Teotihuacan was from one of the looted pits (Burial 12). This person is not thought to have been a ruler; the positioning of his hands behind his back indicates that he was sacri- ficed (Sugiyama 1995:100-101). The possible pres- ence of a Maya foreigner in the other looted pit (Burial 13) is suggested by a high-status (Maya-like) baton from the disturbed fill and 6180 values con- sistent with those from highland Guatemala. Although this individual was probably sacrificed, he does appear to have been of high-status, possibly a priest (Cabrera et al. 1991). If the individual in this pit was indeed a high-status, sacrificed Maya, ques- tions arise as to the nature of Teotihuacan politics. The statement made by the state could have been one of great power and force. This interpretation would, however, be inconsistent with our interpretation of military structure gained from the geographical iden-</page><page sequence="17">REPORTS 233 tities of the soldiers. Alternately, if the burial was made either in reverence to the death of a visiting dignitary or priest, or as a symbolic gesture, the state- ment was one of political ideology. It is also possi- ble that these individuals represent some sort of homage to Teotihuacan, perhaps to ensure prosper- ity and peace in their homelands. Regardless of the type of death experienced by this occupant of Bur- ial 13, he does not appear to have been a local ruler to whom the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was dedi- cated (Sugiyama 1995:1 10, 234-235). Among the seven individuals sampled from the large Burial 14, with the exception of one individual (14I) who spent his entire life in a foreign location, three had grown up in Teotihuacan and moved away, and three had spent their childhoods elsewhere and later moved to yet another foreign land. Because they all spent their most recent years in a foreign location, they could not have been local insurgents or retain- ers. It is possible that the latter group in particular could have been foreign captives, but the presence of locally born individuals in the burial weakens this argument. They could not have been brought to Teoti- huacan to serve as aides to the state.g., scribes, household retainers unless they had been brought so recently as to have had no effect on the isotopic composition of their bone. While this is theoretically possible, most of these individuals were older than the soldiers and the women (i.e., in their 30s). Had they come to Teotihuacan during their youth for pur- poses of employment, there should have been ample time for re-equilibration of phosphate oxygen to have occurred. The range of homeland and sojourning environments in Burial 14 is similar to that of the sol- diers and women, but the residence patterns are dif- ferent. Most notably, the individuals in Burial 14 appear to have moved from one foreign location to another or away from Teotihuacan to foreign loca- tions. Other groups of people whose 6180 values could reflect travel patterns such as these are mer- chants and priests. We speculate that the symbolic and ritual aspects of this particular grave, combined with the ideological significance of the pyramid, might support the interpretation of a religious background for these individuals. They appear to represent the breadth of geographic regions influenced by Teoti- huacan and may have been selected to reflect this fact. Conclusions The oxygen isotopic data presented here demon- strate their usefulness in addressing archaeological issues involving geographical identity. They also pro- vide an illustration of how patterns of movement can be reconstructed within the lifetimes of individuals. This was facilitated by the analysis of the two skele- tal tissues, bone and enamel. The oxygen isotopic results indicate a remarkable degree of geographic diversity and mobility among the sacrificial victims from the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Figures 2, 3, and 5). We have thus been able to test a variety of hypotheses regarding the identity of these victims. Although all of the main categories of victims (i.e., soldiers, women, and the enigmatic Burial 14) show geographic movement, the patterns of movement vary among groups. These patterns have implications for military structure and behavior, the sociopoliti- cal role of women, and the political nature of the state. The oxygen isotopic signatures of the soldiers are dominated by geographic identities that involve either lifetime local sedentism or movement from a variety of foreign regions to Teotihuacan. The latter pattern suggests that a widespread inclusion of for- eign recruits or mercenaries into the military mem- bership of the state, though "recruitment" for the sacrifice likely occurred largely within Teotihuacan. The women were generally either locally sedentary or moved from Teotihuacan to a foreign region. This pattern suggests that they were not foreign captives orconcubines; rather, their movement may have been dictated by the movement of men. All of those in Burial 14 had lived for a long time in a foreign land. They must have either come, or been brought, to Teotihuacan not long before they died. The patterns of their movements include either local or foreign childhood residence followed by migration to another region. Such patterns may have been typicaI of priests or merchants. Among the looted pit burials in the central interior of the pyra- mid are two other individuals who are likely foreign, possibly from a highland Maya region. The geo- graphic identities of the occupants of Burials 13 and 14, combined with the ritual and symbolic aspects of artifact placement and distribution in Burial 14, strongly indicate an ideological basis to the sacrifices. It was likely meant to demonstrate Teotihuacan's relationship to the rest of the Mesoamerican world. The fact that such a demonstration appears locally before most interactions with Teotihuacan appeared archaeologically in foreign regions is significant. The exact nature of that interaction is still unclear,</page><page sequence="18">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 2, 2002] 234 but the patterning of movements among the soldiers and Burial 14 group in particular do not provide a strong argument for military force. Rather, they point more cogently to the magnetism of Teotihuacan's ideology, economics, or political prestige. The sacrificial victims may have been chosen to demonstrate a powerful ideology, either religious or political. Regardless of how they were selected, the geographical breadth they illustrate is profound. At least four different regions of Mesoamerica are rep- resented in the oxygen-isotope ratios of the Feath- ered Serpent Pyramid burials. Through the scale, public occurrence, and multiethnic composition of the sacrifice, Teotihuacan was clearly making a metaphoric statement to either enhance or illustrate its power and prestige to the rest of the Mesoamer- ican world.
