This handsome volume of essays was produced to coin- cide with important exhibitions devoted to Kolbe held in 2009 and 2010 in Dessau, Paderborn and Zurich and is the most significant scholarly contribution to the study of the artist since the publication of Ulf Martens's monograph (based on his doctoral dissertation), Der źfyidiner und Radierer Carl Wilhelm Kolbe d. À. (Berlin 1976). The present book con- sists of sixteen essays by as many authors, including the gen- eral editor Norbert Michels and two distinguished English art historians well-qualified in this field, David Bindman and William Vaughan. These are followed by a fully illustrated se- lective catalogue of the artist's drawings and prints, divided into eleven sections according to theme; a detailed biograph- ical sketch of the artist by Edeltraut Dettmar, supported by quotations from his correspondence; and a selection of Kolbe 's political utterances that reveal his opinions on the French Revolution, his concerns over Napoleon's policies in Europe and his despair over Prussian neutrality and vacilla- tion. The book concludes with an extensive bibliography that includes the primary sources. Carl Wilhelm Kolbe is the most intriguing, diverse and complex member of a remarkable family of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German artists and craftsmen.

Carl Wilhelm Kolbe, Et in Arcadia ego , etching, 406 x 532 mm (Anhaltische Gemäldegalerie Dessau). Christian Wilhelm and his brother Christian Friedrich were both embroiderers in Berlin who specialized in the working of gold thread; his uncle Johann Diederich earned his living as a goldsmith; a cousin Heinrich Christian was a successful portrait painter in Düsseldorf; and his own son, also named Carl Wilhelm, went on to become the leading exponent of Romantic history painting in Berlin. Significantly, in light of his future career as a print maker, Kolbe was related to the eminent painter, engraver and Berlin Academician Daniel Nicholas Chodowiecki, whom he first met in Dessau in 1789. Kolbe's first love as a young man, however, was linguistics. Due to the influence of his French mother, descended from Huguenot refugees, Kolbe (as this volume makes abundantly clear) was reared at home in an atmosphere pervaded by French culture. As a boy he even attended the French School (Collège Français) in Berlin, whose director Jean Pierre Ehrman was also preacher to the large French community, and in 1780 he accepted a position to teach French language at the Philanthropinum in Dessau, arguably the most pro- gressive educational institution of its kind in Germany and the first to implement Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theories on the education of the young. Rousseau's idealistic vision of na- ture would manifest itself in other ways, conspicuously in Kolbe's pictorial evocations of a northern Arcadia. Hitherto essentially self-taught as an artist, in 1789 Kolbe was encouraged by Chodowiecki to study the subject seriously Accordingly, he enrolled the following year as a mature student at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin where 'as a bearded thirty year old surrounded by a swarm of twelve year old boys' he was taught to draw from plaster-casts after the antique by Asmus Jakob Carstens. Some of these drawings (one of which earned him an Academy prize in 1790) and slightly later life- drawings and etchings are the subject of section I of the cata- logue, introduced by Claudia Sedlarz, who in an earlier essay scrutinizes Kolbe's period of study at the Academy, which con- tinued until after the winter semester of 1794-95 and laid the solid foundations of his future development. After five years' absence, Kolbe returned to Dessau in 1795 following an invitation from Prince Leopold Friedrich Franz von Anhalt-Dessau (for whom the celebrated park at Wörlitz</page><page sequence="3">448 CATALOGUE AND BOOK REVIEWS was created) to teach at a proposed art school for artisans. When this project failed to materialize, he resumed teaching French and drawing at the new Hauptschule, successor to the Philanthropinum which had recendy been dissolved. Late in the summer of 1796 his first series of etchings (consistently and typically inscribed with consecutive work numbers) was pub- lished with the tide, 4g Blaetter groestentheils Landschaftlichen Inhalts. In 1798 he was appointed court engraver and, apart from a three-year sojourn in Zurich from 1805 to 1808, he remained in Dessau until he died, resigning from his teaching post through deafness only in 1828. By the time of his death in 1835 he had spent no fewer than 43 years in the principality's capital. It is therefore fitting that the book's first essay, by Norbert Michels, has as its subject 'Carl Wilhelm Kolbe in Dessau'. Drawing on Kolbe's correspondence with the artist Johann Friedrich Bolt, Michels traces his not entirely happy dealings with the court and conjures up a literary and artistic milieu from whose core Kolbe at times felt excluded, while none the less admitting that in Dessau he 'enjoyed more respect as a human being and as an artist than I possibly deserve'. In his letters to Bolt, Kolbe defines his artistic stance on a wide variety of issues ranging from his ideas on landscape composition to the merits and drawbacks of lithography and aquatint. Even before enrolling as a student in Berlin, Kolbe had begun to evince a serious interest in the landscape and a spe- cial preoccupation with the impressive oak forests near Dessau, which later led to his earning the sobriquet 'Eichen- Kolbe'. It was not very long before landscape became his major interest. It was the dominant subject in his first series of etchings, published by Gerhard Fleischer, and remained so in subsequent series. His other published editions included a series of six small idealized landscapes, four landscapes in the style of the Dutch painter and engraver Antonie Waterloo and eighteen large Kräuterblätter (idiosyncratic studies of outsized plants and weeds) issued in Leipzig in 1825, which bear the clearest hallmark of his individual genius (fig. 235). The Kräuterblätter are admirably contextualized in an essay by Agnes Thum, with reference to current floral-sexual sym- bolism and contemporary fashions in landscape gardening. Kolbe's various approaches to the depiction of landscape and his interpretations of it can best be understood perusing sec- tions II-XI of the catalogue. The last of these, with an ac- companying essay by Bernhard von Waldkirch, is dedicated to the series of 25 etchings that Kolbe was commissioned to produce after some of the finest landscapes painted in gouache during the last ten years of his life by the distin- 236.

Kolbe de- scribed his three years in Zurich as a guest of the Gessner family as 'the happiest of my life', and the resultant etchings, published between 1805 and 181 1, are among his greatest achievements. In Gessner's originals one finds echoes of Claude, Rousseau and Joseph Anton Koch on the one hand and debts to Ruysdael, Waterloo and Herman van Swanevelt on the other. In Kolbe 's own work there is a similar dichotomy, and his debt to Dutch landscape traditions is closely examined in an essay by Thea Vignau-Wilberg, while Anna Schulz, in her introduction to section II of the catalogue, acknowledges Kolbe's high regard for Paulus Potter and the influence he had on Kolbe's depiction of animal Staffage. An artist as talented and prolific as Kolbe (he is known to have executed some 314 etchings alone) was bound to make an impression not only on his contemporaries but on later generations as well. During his lifetime, his inspirational teaching played just as important a rôle as the study of his finished works in influencing those younger artists with whom he came into personal contact, such as Franz Krüger and the brothers Heinrich, Ferdinand and Friedrich Olivier. His wider, and later, impact is assessed in essays by Jost Hermand, who evaluates the links between Kolbe and Caspar David Friedrich, and Brigitte Heise, who traces his fortuna crìtica from the Romantic period onwards and in the process demon- strates the power of his imagery over artists as diverse as Carl Blechen, Arnold Böcklin and Max Ernst. William Vaughan, by way of contrast, demonstrates that despite the success en- joyed in England by his younger German contemporaries the Nazarenes, Kolbe's etchings made no such appeal to English tastes. He did have a soulmate, however, in the figure of Samuel Palmer in his Shoreham years, who saw in the oaks he was studying 'the grasp and grapple of roots; the muscular belly and shoulders; the twisted sinews' that call to mind the anthropomorphism inherent in so many of Kolbe's subjects (fig. 236). Other essays, such as those by David Bindman and Katrin Sybille Lutz, discuss Kolbe's imagery within the broader cul- tural context of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century German thought, while Anna Schultz examines the themes of satire and eroticism in his figurai compositions. Kolbe as patriot is the subject of an essay by Michael Niedermeier; Peter Prange deals with Kolbe as a draughtsman; and An- nette Dorgerloh emphasizes the influence of Swanevelt in particular on the architectural motifs in Kolbe's landscapes. Kolbe's intellectual prowess was such that, while pursuing his career as an etcher, he wrote an authoritative treatise on Ger- man and French vocabulary, Uber den Wortreichtum der deutschen und französischen Sprache, and another on the purity of lan- guages, Uber Wortmengerei, Sprachreinheit und Sprachreinigung, that led in 1 8 10 to the award of a doctorate in linguistics from the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. An autobiogra- phy was published in 1825. The volume under review does ample justice to this multi- faceted personality in essays as varied and stimulating as they are informative. The quality of the illustrations is excellent throughout, and the reproductions in the catalogue have all the crispness and clarity of the originals. Kolbe has been well served.</page></plain_text>
