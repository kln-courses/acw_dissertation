<plain_text><page sequence="1">POTTERY FROM ERETRIA (PLATES I--I4) MOST of the material published in this study is at present housed in the National Museum at Athens or in the museum at Eretria. It was excavated by the Greek Archaeological Service and under the direction of Kourouniotes over the period of years 1897-1917; annual reports were published in PAE.1 The vases which Kourouniotes published in AE I903 and the black figure amphorae published by Laurent in AE 1901 were taken to Athens, together with all the complete subgeometric and orientalising grave amphorae and a number of other fragments now in an apotheke of the National Museum. The remainder, mainly sherds, was left in a small museum at Eretria. Unfortunately the pottery in Eretria has suffered in the course of time. No record of provenance has been kept and tomb groups are confused; complete profiles are hard to find as many plain fragments of body or foot had been thrown away or have since been lost. Much also had not been thoroughly cleaned, hence the hitherto un- noticed inscriptions on the archaic amphora (no. 17, p. 43 below). The pottery is here discussed in six sections. The sub-geometric, orientalising, sixth century and black figure grave amphorae each have one section devoted to them. The first section covers all other geometric and seventh century pottery, and the final section all other black figure pottery. Imports are discussed at the end of the first section. I have not con- cerned myself here with the long series of black figure, white ground and red figure lekythoi found in such numbers at Eretria, dating from the end of the sixth century onwards, or with any other pottery of the period after the Persian sack of Eretria in 491 B.c. Previous work in this field is confined to the publications by Kourouniotes and Laurent mentioned above, a general appreciation of the Eretrian style by Prof. Dugas in Mdlanges Holleaux, based on the Vases exhibited in the National Museum, and an article (AJA 1941, 64 ff.) and an unpublished dissertation for the University of California by Dr. D. A. Amyx on Eretrian black figure. SECTION I GEOMETRIC AND SEVENTH CENTURY POTTERY2 Kourouniotes' excavations in the gravefield and in the temple of Apollo Daphnephoros yielded most of the pieces published in this section. The vases which he published in AE 1903 are now in Athens, although I have been unable to locate some fragments. The remainder are in the museum at Eretria. There is no record of provenance, although material from temple offerings can sometimes be identified. I am deeply indebted to Mr. J. M. Cook, the Director of the British School at Athens and to Mr. R. M. Cook for their advice and help in the course of my research, and to Dr. D. A. Amyx, Dr. T. Dohrn, and Prof. H. R. W. Smith for photo- graphs of objects I have been unable to study at first hand. My thanks are due to Miss L. H. Jeffery, Prof. Sir John Beazley, and Prof. Rumpf, whom I have consulted on various points. Mrs. Karouzou's assistance and kindness to me in such difficult times for the National Museum in Athens have been invaluable: Mr. Kontoleon kindly gave me permission to study in Mykonos Museum, and Mr. Threpsiades to study and publish pottery in Eretria Museum. I publish photographs of vases in Mykonos and the Louvre through the kindness of Mr. Kontoleon and M. Devambez. It was through the generosity of the trustees of the Walston Studentship which I held I948/1949 and I949/ 950, the Craven Fund in Cambridge, and my college, Magdalene College, Cambridge, that I was able to undertake this research. The Craven Fund has also kindly assisted in meeting the cost of the illustrations to this article. 1 Other excavations at Eretria REG 1895, 439. a For convenience in the following sections vases in the Delos publication are referred to only by their published group letter and number, and published Samos vases simply by the author's name followed by page or plate reference (Technau, AM 1929, 6 ff.; Eilmann, AM 1933, 47 ff.). B</page><page sequence="2">2 JOHN BOARDMAN The vases and fragments are grouped broadly according to their shapes. Imports are noted in the course of the description and discussed further at the end of the section. Except in the case of these imports the quality of the biscuit is usually fine, without mica, though with occasional flecks of white chalk. Its colour varies from a pinkish-orange to buff, and it is often indistinguishable from Attic or even Boeotian clay. The normal surface colour is pale orange, as in Attic, but some vases have been fired to a light grey. It is quite unlike any island clay, though similar to that of the few archaic sherds from Chalcis.3 Where a slip is used there is no noticeable difference in the clay; I have therefore not treated the slipped fragments separately. Today Eretria has no clay of her own, or at least knows of none.4 The nearest clay-beds are at Chalcis, and at Vasiliko, which would have been in Chalcidian territory in this period. There are some, however, at Batheia, about 8 km. to the east of Eretria, and clay could easily have been brought oversea from Oropos. I think it most unlikely that the potters' ovens were anywhere other than in Eretria itself. PAINTED WARE Kotylai, Skyphoi, etc. Protocorinthian kotylai were imitated in large numbers in Eretria (FIG. I ; PLATE I A, 1I-8). In two cases (PLATE I A, I, 2) a heavy cream slip is used,5 and the decoration of horizontal lines and butterfly pattern in the handle zone is most carefully executed. Alternate horizontal lines on the body were painted with thinned glaze, an affectation not met in true Protocorinthian work. The late eighth century bird-kotylai were also imitated 6 (FIG. I. 5-9, I I; PLATE I A 6, 7). The maeander appears, once in connection with butterfly ornament ? (FIG. I. 4). Other imitations in a cruder linear style are paralleled in East Greece, and in the Cyclades by Parian and Naxian geometric skyphoi; 8 they bear motifs which we meet again on skyphoi from Eretria. Miniature kotylai with simple dot or blob decoration in the handle zone were made (FIG. I. 12, 13). On some examples the lip turns out slightly. One fragment uses added white painted decoration-a not uncommon practice in Protocorinthian,9 but the motif of upright wavy lines is unusual, and characteristically Eretrian (FIG. I. IO). There are many fragments of simple glazed one-handled geometric cups.x0 Unfortunately no complete profile could be made up, but the type is sufficiently clear from the fragments to justify the reconstruction of some typical profiles (FIG. 2, not x). There are usually one or two thin reserved bands, in the consistent but dull glaze, within the lip, and occasionally another lower down within the cup. A simple X cross is the only decoration on the strap handles. It was no doubt this type of vase which was found in the incised-pithos burial mentioned by Kourouniotes (AE I903, 26: cf. the pithos below, p. I I, no. I). In a similar style are frag- ments of skyphoi with lines of dots at the rim; of these one complete profile is preserved (PLATE I A, 17; FIG. 2 X). s See below, note 73. 4 But see Pliny NH XXXV 38; Gardner JHS 1894, 185 n. 36. 5 Similar imitations employing a slip have been found at Delphi, and cf. on the late seventh century Vari vases, BCH 1939, 287. 6 On the type cf. Weinberg, Corinth VII i, 39 f.; imitated often in Attic, once on Delos, Ae73. 7 Cf. DIlos Ae8o. 8 Cf. Ddlos Ae and Bb groups. Both Paros and Naxos made these late geometric small vases, both occasionally em- ploying a slip. Naxian work, on the evidence of its seventh century pottery and finds on the islands themselves, is probably to be distinguished by its darker red micaceous clay and its creamier slip. Dulos Ae24-33, 36-47 and most of Bb may well be Naxian, Ae53-6o, 75, 76 and perhaps Bb56, 58 Parian. 9 Johansen, Vases Sicyoniens 69 f., where examples are cited; Weinberg, op. cit. 37. 10 Young, Hesp.

X FIG. 2.-GEOMETRIC CUPS AND SKYPHOI (X = PLATE I A, 17).</page><page sequence="4">4 JOHN BOARDMAN Many fragments of skyphoi and kantharoi with offset rims employ simple geometric linear decoration, no doubt in part inspired by Protocorinthian (FIG. 3; PLATE I A, 9-16). The closest parallels are again with Cycladic geometric skyphoi, but the clay of the Eretrian examples is distinctly unmicaceous, unlike that of the Parian or Naxian vases. However, one fragment bears a characteristically Parian slip, and the clay is micaceous (PLATE I A, 9). As in the Cyclades a slip is occasionally employed (FIG. 3. 2-4, 7; PLATE I A, I I, 12). The maeander is common 11 on these shapes (FIG. 4. I, 2; PLATE I A, 19-21); for the loose type of maeander on PLATE I A, 21 compare De'los Ae47. There is one example (PLATE I A, 18) of a skyphos with concentric semicircles hanging from the rim, and here overlapping. It is common on Delos,12 and finds on Tenos 13 suggested to Buschor 14 a Cycladic origin for the type, but it is found all over the Greek world.'5 Metopal decoration with familiar Cycladic motifs is common. The dotted circles and the dots filling the corners of the panels are Parian in inspiration16 (FIG. 4. 6; PLATE I A, 22, 24). A fragment with similar slip, lip profile and decoration to PLATE I A, 22 has been found in Chalcis: 17 the circles are not compass-drawn. The crossed-leaf motif and geometric birds in panels, familiar on much Cycladic work, are found is (FIGs. 4. 4-5; 5. 1-2; PLATE I A, 23, I B, I, 2). FIG. 5. 2 bears a dull slip. The slip and redder clay of PLATE I B, I, as well as its decoration, suggest that it could be an import from Naxos.a9 Rims decorated with a dotted net pattern are found on slipped fragments which may well also be Naxian (PLATE I B, 5, 6). Lines of compass-drawn concentric circles on rims are common 20 (FIG. 5. 3; PLATE I B, 7-9). PLATE I B, 4 offers an unusual East Greek motif,21 and PLATE I B, 3 an unusual lip pattern.22 Fragments of kantharos handles are decorated with thin parallel horizontal lines or a Union Jack pattern (FIG. 5- 4) ; some are slipped. Finally, there is a series of fragments of distinctive fabric and style (FIG. 6; PLATE I B, I 0-27), probably of local manufacture, as I know of no similar ware from any other Greek site. The clay varies from pale orange to brown. A cream slip is sometimes used on the base strip and on the lip (PLATE I B, IO, II, 16, 19), and to fill the outline geometric devices on the body (PLATE I B, 10, I I, 20-23, 27). White paint is used in wavy lines on the lip and inside the vases over the glaze (PLATE I B, 12, 13, 17). Regular geometric swastikas, crosses, and lozenges are the elements of the decoration: they are not hatched but merely left in outline or filled with cream slip. Oval ornament 23 and wavy lines edged with dots also appear (PLATE I B, 18, 20, 2I, 23, 27; I2, 17). The motifs are usually disposed in the field without division, except (in one case) by an upright zigzag (PLATE I B, 24) or by vertical lines (PLATE I B, 12, 17). The shapes (FIG. 6) are small straight-sided skyphoi with straight slightly inset lips, or mugs with curved profile and turned-out rims. No complete profile is preserved. '1 Cf. Dilos Ae36-46. 12 Cf.

It is, however, hardly ever micaceous and bears some resemblance to that of geometric vases from Tenos--no greater resemblance, however, than it does to Eretrian or even to Attic clay. 16 Paros AM 1917, 76.

KRATER FRAGMENTS.</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN BOARDMAN Kraters, Dinoi, etc. Several fragments from a large krater (PLATE 2 A, I) are decorated in the Attic ' Dipylon' style, and are possibly Attic work. The only motifs are maeander, key pattern zigzags, and lozenge chain in the lower band, quite carefully executed. Geometric animals are found in this group; the motif of a bird under a horse is familiar; 24 the upright wavy and straight lines bounding the panel are a Cycladic touch (PLATE I B, 28). The design of FIG. 7 is unintelligible to me; it possibly represents parts of human or animal legs. Some krater fragments bear a heavy cream slip (PLATE 2 A, 8--IO). On one a horse is grazing (PLATE 2 A, 9) : the short strokes above its back are its mane. For the object springing from the ground beneath it see Roes, Greek Geometric Art 32,25 where such are interpreted as 'sun-standards '. This is the only example of the motif which I know on a vase which is not Argive. The dotted net pattern in a broad band or panel is more common later, in the seventh century.26 All three fragments (PLATE 2 A, 8--IO) suggest from their slip, clay, and the profile of PLATE 2 A, 8,27 a Naxian origin. Kourouniotes (AE 1903, II) mentions fragments of footed kraters in graves at Eretria, and illustrates one piece (ibid., 3, fig. 2) now in Athens (PLATE 2 A, 2). The style of decoration on vases of a similar shape 28 is most closely paralleled in Eleusis, but the type is found all over the Greek world.29 The handles are either double or single with a stirrup springing from the rim to the junction or to the top of the are of the handles. There is one example of a vertical strap handle.30 A fragment of a double handle-attachment for a stirrup has on the body of the vase beneath the handle the figure of a bird; this could equally well belong with any of the other krater fragments (PLATE 2 A, I, 8--IO) mentioned above, as could fragments of krater feet with ribbing.31 Below the handles of the vase published by Kourouniotes (my PLATE 2 A, 2) are two small projections (one preserved). They resemble the painted decoration below the handles of the Cycladic krater in Munich (Dugas, Cdramique des Cyclades I99, where they are interpreted as a prototype of the later familiar eyes beneath handles), or, more closely, the mastoi found on figurines and vases (not all anthropomorphic). In this position, however, this example seems unique. Fragmentary spouts from kraters are found (PLATE 2 B, 2-5). Two of these (PLATE 2 B, 2, 4) bear a heavy cream slip, and the fabric of PLATE 2 B, 4 suggests a Naxian origin. The chequer pattern beneath the spout is common on Attic and Cycladic examples.32 Many other fragments are slipped (FIG. 8. 4, 5). FIG. 8. 3, 6, 7 have an apparently polished surface. PLATE 2 B, I has a horizontal strap handle, and the rim only is slipped. Geometric kraters with simple linear decoration (FIGS. 8. I-2; IO, 1-5; PLATE 2 B, 9-13) are the forerunners of the Eretrian seventh century dinoi with which I deal below. PLATE 2 B, 13 is slipped, and the same scheme of decoration appears exactly on an unslipped fragment also. FIG. Io. 6-8 are from rims of bowls or pyxides. 24 Cf. Roes, Greek Geometric Art 23. 25 Cf.

It bears a red band at the base and two on the body zone overlying the broad glazed band. PLATE 2 B, 8 is from the lip of a bowl decorated in the polychrome style of the burial amphorae of the seventh century (Groups C and D below). Red is used in broad bands on lip and body, and in a thin band below the wavy line on the body. White lines outline the broad red bands and white is used for the wavy line on the body and for the dot rosettes. In the museum at Eretria there is a great number of fragments from the lips of dinoi 33 (FIG. 9; PLATE 2 B, 6, 7, I4-1I8), and some fragments from bodies which can be associated with the same group. The decoration is of the sub-geometric type familiar on the grave amphorae (Groups A and B below). White paint is much used on lip and body, as on the latest examples of the sub-geometric amphorae. Apparently the upper part of the body was decorated with groups of upright wavy lines, separated by straight lines; occasionally the wavy lines are single, and in some cases broad upright bands of glaze are decorated with white paint twists or wavy lines. The lower part has narrow horizontal lines reserved in the glaze, and on the broad glaze bands there is decoration in white paint. These vases are probably from the Apollo temple 34 where they would be offerings, as such were at the Heraion in Samos.35 It is in Samos too that we find the closest parallels to the lip profiles of the Eretrian vases.36 Unfortunately nowhere is enough preserved to restore a complete profile, although we may assume a rounded bottom as on the Samos vases. The diameter at the lip seems in no case to have been greater than about 30 cm. Slip is never used. Closed Vases. Amphorae. Kourouniotes published in AE I903, 15 ff., fig. 7, a large neckless amphora from Eretria, now in Athens 37 (detail, PLATE 3 A). As he observes, the rim is preserved to its full height in one place, and there are traces of the handle attachments. The figure drawing and the lack of maeander 8 or key pattern on the body suggest a late date, around 700oo. The use of the dotted lozenge chains as filling ornament is most unusual,39 and the 8 band on the body, which touches the lines bordering the frieze neither at the top nor at the bottom, is a regular Cycladic motif, common only on the latest Attic geometric work.40 Closest to the Eretria amphora in style are the amphorae in Leyden and Eleusis.4' The warriors' shields bear devices in white paint 42 (FIG. I3a); the type of chariot with open-work upper half and step at the back to assist mounting is unusual.43 The place of origin of this vase may well be Eretria, as is its provenance. Of other fragments from large closed vases some bear a heavy creamy slip (PLATE 3 A, 2, 3). 33 Better perhaps called lebetes (Richter and Milne, Shapes and Names 9 f.); cf. the lebetes gamikoi, or nymphikoi, of temple inscriptions (AM o907, 98, n. ). 34 PAE 19oo, 54; 191o, 268. 35 Eilmann io6.

PLATE 3 A, 5 from the neck of an amphora is slipped.44 The object in the panel on the left may be the end of a bird's wing; 45 the ' epsilon' above is merely an unfinished cross-hatched triangle. A fragment from the body of an amphora is decorated in Protogeometric style with concentric compass-drawn semi- circles (FIG. I 3b). Attic half circles of this type are usually based on one or two thin horizontal lines above the rest of the glazed body of the vase; compare, however, Cycladic types, Delos Aa21-26. The blob of paint is more probably a mistake than an attempt to imitate the Attic hour-glass ornament in this position (Kerameikos IV, pl. 7, 3, 4). Other fragments are decorated with a coarse chequer pattern 46 (PLATE 3 A, 6), an ornament akin to a popular Protocorinthian motif 47 (FIG. I I. 3), and an unusual pattern possibly East Greek in inspiration 48 (PLATE 3 A, 7) ; fragments from bodies of amphorae near the handle attachments are decorated with eight- spoked wheels, a Cycladic motif 49 (PLATE 3 A, 4). I do not understand the design on FIG. I 3C. One would expect the frieze of wavy lines and the horizontal lines to lie below the figured scene, but if inverted the part of the panel preserved may be understood as showing part of the sickle wing and spiral headdress of a sphinx. Fragments from the bodies and bases of plain glazed amphorae with reserved horizontal lines are decorated with linear motifs in white paint 50 (FIG. I I. 4-6). The fragment illustrated on PLATE 3 B, I, has pale orange clay and is painted with alternate lines in powdery grey and red. No handle attachments are preserved. The fabric and quality of the paint suggest Boeotian origin, but the shape is unusual. Inverted it might be the foot of a large bird-kylix with an uncommon foot profile.5' It is probably the neck of a jar. Oenochoai. From an oenochoe neck comes part of a bird in a panel (FIG. I2. 2), and from the shoulders of narrow-necked oenochoai two fragments 52 (PLATE 3 A, 13, 14), Of which the latter may be East Greek. Panels reserved in the glazed necks of oenochoai and filled with simple linear geometric patterns are familiar in Attic and Cycladic work.53 From the lip of a large and elaborately decorated oenochoe is a fragment coated with a creamy slip 54 (PLATE 3 A, 8). Miss Roes 55 quotes examples of birds above or on horses' backs in Greek geometric art, but in no instance do they peck at the horse's mane, as ours seems to do.56 The splaying tail-feathers of the bird are also unusual.'7 Another fragment from the shoulder of a slipped oenochoe bears a row of silhouette birds (PLATE 3 A, 9). In the seventh century Eretrian polychrome style are two fragments of trefoil oenochoe lips employing added white paint (PLATE 3 A, 15, 16). A jug (H. 28 cm. PLATE 3 B, 4) with a deep cutaway neck and a single handle (missing) may be of a date quite late in the sixth century.58 Kourouniotes publishes a geometric jug 44 Cf. Ddlos Bb5-8. 46 Cf.

They were doubtless votive offerings and were certainly made locally. The fabric is uniform, but slip is used on some pieces (FIG. 15. 6-8, I I; PLATE 3 A, 21I). The decoration is sub- geometric. The shapes vary considerably, the necks being tall and cylindrical, or short and almost conical (perhaps an earlier shape). Unfortunately the only nearly complete example, that published by Kourouniotes, cannot now be found, but FIG. I6a gives an impression of what was one of the most typical shapes. INCISED AND STAMPED UNPAINTED WARE In AE 1903, 26 f., fig. 10, is published a coarse pithos from Eretria with incised decoration, which was used for the burial of an infant. In the publication Kourouniotes mentions twenty others found whole or in pieces. The published pithos is now in Athens (NM 12132, Nicole Cat. no. 802). Six others remain in Eretria, five of them bearing incised decoration. The type is common throughout the Greek world.6" Examples from Phaleron are dated by Young (AJA 1942, 31, fig. 12) to the first quarter of the seventh century; these were also used for infant burial. Apart from one unpublished example in the Kerameikos there is none with the high fenestrated foot which seems typical in Eretria; nor are there any, except from Eleusis and the Dipylon, which can match the Eretrian series for richness of incised decoration. There seems to be no regularity either in the type of foot, which may be straight-sided and conical, or broadly splaying, or in the fenestrations, which may be rectangular, oval, triangular, or broad. The neck is only once (FIG. I6C) set off from the body, and there is always a broad overhanging rim. I see no reason to suppose that these were imported from Boeotia as Kourouniotes suggests. I.

Protocorinthian was much imitated, sometimes most competently, but I found no fragments of Protocorinthian ware in Eretria. Two Corinthian plastic vases in the shape of a ram and a crouching hare have been found.'67 Amongst the vases in Athens from Eretria is a Late Corinthian aryballos with typical cinquefoil decoration.68 Boeotia. Hutton published in AE 1899, 26, fig. I, a terracotta figurine from Eretria 69 of familiar Boeotian type, dating to the first half of the sixth century.70 The representation of a flying bird in typical Boeotian bird-kylix style on figurines is not common.7 For other imports of figurines from Boeotia see Winter, Antike Terrakotten, xix ff. Fragments of relief pithoi have also been found in Eretria. From their description they seem to be of the typical Boeotian type.72 Dr. Amyx tells me of a Boeotian vase on the Athens Market in 1936, said to come from Eretria (see below n. 80, no. 9). The Boeotian vase Athens NM 12856 has been described as from Eretria, but the museum inventory does not mention its provenance (Akerstrdm, Der Geometrische Stil in Italien, 65, fig. 46; see below n. 80, no. 3). Attica. Hutton and Winter (op. cit.) notice Attic terracottas of late sixth century type from Eretria. How much of the remainder of the material published above may be called Eretrian is a difficult question. The only other possible source of much of the pottery could be Attica, or perhaps even Chalcis, or the potteries which supplied Chalcis.73 Some fragments are certainly not Attic (e.g. skyphoi and mugs, PLATE I B, IO--27 and the slipped fragments), some are undoubtedly Eretrian (e.g. the dinoi, FIG. 9; PLATE 2 B, 6, 7, I4-1I8). In the course of the description of the sherds I have had occasion to note as much Cycladic influence as Attic- as we might expect if the vases were made in Eretria, a powerful city with considerable Cycladic connections, if not in fact possessing an island empire at one time. Further consideration of Eretria's debt to her neighbours will be taken in connection with Eretria's most charac- teristic vases, the grave amphorae (Sections II, III, and IV). I believe that most of the pottery published above was made locally. Of other artistic activity in Eretria in this period little is known, but it appears that about 66 Eilmann, fig. I7, x8.

I have picked up archaic sherds there, and there is a small collection in the Museum of the British School at Athens. The clay seems to be much the same as Eretrian; there are slipped fragments of kraters and skyphoi decorated in a Cycladic rather than an Attic style, and some fragments akin to the ' Boeotian ' seventh century amphorae. Dr. Dohrn tells me that he has picked up black figure sherds in the same area, and in Chalcis Museum there are two or three small vases from Chalcis which do not seem to be Attic, Boeotian, or distinctively Eretrian; these I know only from photographs (below p. 46 and n. 309).</page><page sequence="13">POTTERY FROM ERETRIA 13 700 there was a local school of gold workers and engravers,74 just as in the sixth century there was a local school of bronze vase makers. THE GRAVE AMPHORAE For the purposes of discussion I have divided the grave amphorae of Eretria into five groups. The subgeometric groups, A and B, are discussed in Section II, the orientalising Group C in Section III, the sixth century Group D in Section IV and the mid-sixth century Atticising black figure amphorae in Section V. In each section I give an overall description of the group and considerations of chronology and connections with other fabrics, followed by a catalogue of the important vases and fragments. In a preliminary discussion is included a brief description of the development of shapes over the whole series. Individual pieces are referred to by their group letter and catalogue number. Kourouniotes' illustrations in his article in AE 1903 are a necessary supplement to my own photographs and drawings of vases in Groups A and B. The archaic amphorae from Eretria were excavated by Kourouniotes in 1897 and the following seasons.75 All but one (A4) and some fragments were brought to Athens where most were given inventory numbers and exhibited, while others,76 with more fragments, were kept in an apotheke. They had been used for the burial of infants who were put into the amphorae with their heads towards the vase mouth. The vases were laid in the ground on their sides, with the mouth to the north. They can hardly ever have stood above the grave, as did the Dipylon amphorae, since they were to be the graves themselves; nor is it likely that they would have been on view anywhere, except in the potter's shop before the interment. It may be that the funerary use was not originally intended, though it is noteworthy that in Eretria the ultimate use for vases of this shape known to us was the same from about 700oo, with the painted amphorae of Groups A and B and the incised pithoi illustrated above (FIG. 16), to about 550, when black figure vases were used, deliberately echoing in their profiles the seventh century shapes. Vases of a similar shape were, of course, used in burials all over the Greek world in the seventh century and earlier, but most were presumably intended to stand above the grave and to be seen. Child burial in vases is common from prehistoric times, but almost invariably in coarse undecorated pots. So, compared with the general Greek practice, these Eretrian child burials in elaborately painted amphorae stand out as something quite unusual. Their use, as originally intended, may not have been funerary, but it was certainly not utilitarian; the handles are useless, the feet could never have supported the vase over a fire and merely add height. If they were simply used for storage the choice of painted decoration presents a fresh problem. The animals and sphinxes on vases of Groups C and D could have some funerary connection, the women could be mourners; on the black figure examples the wedding scenes and the likeness of the vases themselves to Attic sixth century lebetes gamikoi might suggest another cult or domestic significance. Further aspects of the problem will be discussed below in connection with the black figure amphorae; our primary interest here is in the painting of the vases themselves. But first their shape. In more than a century the shapes of the Eretrian grave amphorae develop very little."77 74 A fine series of gold diadems discussed by Reichel, Griechisches Goldrelief, 32, nos. 24-28. The incised figure scenes seem decidedly non-Attic and rather in a' Boeotian' sub-geometric style (see Kunze reviewing Reichel, Gnomon 1949, 3, 7). 75 PAE x897, 21; 1898,98; I9oo00, 55; AE I903, I ff. 76 The cleaning of the large amphorae was rather too thorough in some cases (AM 1903, 191).

The general proportions remain the same, but the lip profile does show some development (FIG. I8). The concave moulding typical of most of the subgeometric series (Group B) disappears on the orientalising vases which have a simple flat strip moulding (Group C), itself later showing a marked concavity again on the crude Group D vases.

Boeotian group (see below n. 80), but the cylindrical neck is quite unlike the splaying profiles of the Boeotian vases. Most of the Group A and B amphorae have single glazed handles (double on AI, BI). Group C and D have double handles (except C3), but in Group C the two arcs of the handles do not meet in a central ridge but are attached separately to the body, whereas in Group D they do always meet and often project with a pronounced knob at the base of the join. The feet are broad and conical, except in Group A where they are slimmer; they are sometimes fenestrated. The concave moulding at the base on Group B gives place to a pronounced ridge on an otherwise straight profile in Group C, which disappears in Group D. No lids are preserved. The shape is known in the Cyclades, Boeotia, and Attica from the late eighth to the early sixth century. The concave lip moulding of Groups B and D is commonly found on Cycladic vases, but invariably below either an overhanging or a splaying rim. The broad conical</page><page sequence="16">16 JOHN BOARDMAN feet are most closely paralleled on the 'Melian' amphorae,78 the earliest of which must be nearly halfa century later than our earliest example. Double handles are, of course, common elsewhere but the peculiarity of the non-joining handles noted in Group C seems unique. Degenerations in the neck profile in the sixth century are noticed below (Di i, DI2). The black figure amphorae retain the proportions of the archaic series, but many details in their shapes, as in their decoration, were borrowed from Attica. SECTION II SUBGEOMETRIC SERIES: GROUPS A AND B Detailed differences between the groups are explained below. Generally amphorae of Group A have low broad necks, and slim conical feet. The moulding of lip and base is simple. Group B amphorae have an added concave moulding at lip and base, and usually a broader foot. The neck profile develops from a chimney shape to a broader one less clearly set off from the body. The groups do not follow one another chronologically, but seem to run concurrently, and in decoration many details are common to both, though it is only in Group A that figured scenes occur, and the familiar friezes of upright wavy lines are continuous in Group A but broken into groups of three or four in Group B. Freer use of added colour seems an indication of lateness, particularly the red bands on neck and body (A5, B6), and white wavy lines at the shoulder junction (A2, B5, B6). The practice of decorating the back of the vase with less care and detail is not known in Eretria until the orientalising Group C, though regularly practised in Attica, Boeotia, and the Cyclades. Turning to the main elements of decoration we find the continuous friezes of upright wavy lines appear first in Group A. The motifis regular on Theran seventh century amphorae79 in which the necks are generally broader and lower than the Eretrian examples. It occurs also particularly on a group of Boeotian subgeometric amphorae with splaying necks and 78 Cf. Pfuhl, MuZ III, fig. I05, and references below, p. 24. 9 Thera II I98 ff.; AM x903, 183 ff., Group J; and see Brock BSA XLIV 75 f. Buschor (AM 1929, 142 ff.) called these vases Parian and his suggestion seems to have been accepted by most who have written about Cycladic vases since that date (e.g. Karouzou JdI 1937, I87 ff.; Brock BSA XLIV 74 ff., but contrast Blakeway BSA XXXIII 583, n. 4). He connects them with an earlier group of vases represented notably by the Dilos Aa group and many of the Ae group small vases, and by particularly rich and varied finds of fragments of such vases on Paros (the material, still unpublished, in Paros Museum, and the sites at the Delion, the Zeus-Eileithyia hill and the town acropolis, which yield many sherds), which make it appear highly probable that these vases were made in Paros. They represent a popular late and sub-geometric fabric which is found wherever excavations in the Cyclades are undertaken, Buschor seeks the transition to the Thera vases in Pfuhl's' besondere Gruppe' (AM 190o3, s87 f.) and the similarity in style is certainly striking. But the Thera amphorae have a number of notable peculiarities. Unlike the earlier Parian vases which are found all over the Cyclades (and on Thera) these amphorae are found only on Thera. The Rheneia graves yielded examples of all known Cycladic fabrics of the eighth to the sixth centuries with the notable exceptions of the two series found in such numbers on Thera, i.e. the Theran geometric vases, and the amphorae under discussion. No sherds of these vases have been found on Paros, as Buschor admits (op. cit. 143) although many sites have been excavated and much pottery of the period found. Why Delos should not have favoured vases which were so popular in Thera both in the eighth and seventh centuries is a question I would not care to answer, nor, if the Thera vases are Parian, why it was only these Parian vases and the Theran geometric vases that were scorned. The Parian fabric is easily recognisable: a sandy-orange colour, usually with many small particles of mica, similar to that of Naxos but not so red. The only so-called Parian amphorae from Thera which I have examined have coarse dark red clay, not so very unlike that of the Theran geometric vases if it were better cleaned and refined. The distinction can be noted even within the ' besondere Gruppe', the ' dunkelrot' clay of J 14 and 15, and the ' orangerot' or 'braunrot' clay of J I6-2I. There are considerable similarities in decoration and shape between the Thera vases and the Parian vases, but hardly more than there is between any two other near contemporary Cycladic fabrics. I think the case for calling the Thera amphorae ' Parian' is not proven, and that they are probably as native to the island of Thera as are the geometric vases.</page><page sequence="17">POTTERY FROM ERETRIA 17 feet; 80 on these vases it is often found encircling the belly also, but this is never the case in Eretria. The friezes of upright wavy lines in groups of three or four, regular around the neck and on the belly of amphorae of Group B, are equally common in the same positions on 'Boeotian' vases.81 On Cycladic vases it is usually confined to the back of the vase, almost as an apology for the continuous band in the same zone on the front.82 But this discrimination against the back of the vase is unknown in Eretria at this time, and the use of a multiple brush should have rendered unnecessary any labour-saving considerations.83 The narrow bands of grouped slim upright wavy lines encircling the neck (A2) or body below the handle zone (AI, 3, 4. BI) are probably inspired by Protocorinthian. It is a common motif in all fabrics, but not on large vases as in Eretria. Continuous bands of chevrons or wavy lines are more common on the large amphorae of the Cyclades or Attica. The upright bars in the handle zone panels of A5, B3, 6 certainly derive from the lentil type of decoration found in the same position on B2. The motif is most common on geometric and archaic vases from the Cyclades and Attica, where the lentils are hollow or hatched, not usually in plain silhouette,"4 and in bands around the body of a vase, not in panels as here. Many features of these amphorae are recalled on vases found in Italy, most of them certainly of local manufacture but betraying strong Greek influence. We may instance the unusual neck decoration ofAI, the bands of upright wavy lines, the tall slim butterfly ornament (A4, B4), lentil friezes and the narrow bands seen on A2.85 Many of these motifs are obviously borrowed from Corinth, but others find even closer parallels on 'Boeotian' amphorae and seem borrowed from a Boeotian-Euboean homeland style, and a little from the Cyclades. Eretrian vases are of this group but were not themselves particularly imitated and I can identify no certain Eretrian exports to Italy, nor for that matter to any Greek site in this period.86 Closest are the 'Boeotian' vases but there seems to be no good reason why Boeotian wares should influence Italy. Chalcis and her colonies were the obvious intermediaries.87 It is beyond the scope of this study to go further into the problems suggested by the Italian 80 I. Louvre CA 824.

On the Theran amphora in the Museum of the British School at Athens (JHS 19o2, 73-unfortunately the photograph reveals nothing) a quadruple brush was used for the upright wavy lines and the narrow bands of Q. On our D io a quintuple brush was used for the wavy lines on the neck and in the narrow body frieze, also for the transverse lines on the top of the rim and on the foot.

M. Cook, JHS 1946, 70, n. 32), but finds on the island have been slight (Rodenwaldt, Kerkyra II 69, 27o, 172) and though, no doubt, some of the Waterhouse Collection vases in the British Museum came from Corcyra, none show any peculiarly Eretrian characteristics. 87 Dunbabin, op. cit., 5. C</page><page sequence="18">r8 JOHN BOARDMAN vases, but the ' Boeotian' series are nearer home and of more immediate relevance. Of the vases discussed and listed by Hampe 88 the provenance of only two is certain, one from Tiryns (Johansen, Vases Sicyoniens 33, fig. I3; Hampe, VI4), and one from Thebes (Hampe, VI, pl. I7, I8)-an altogether exceptional piece. The others were mostly attributed by dealers to ' Thebes ' or ' Boeotia '. They fall into a number of small groups 89 which surely represent local centres in and around Boeotia. Can some of them represent the seventh century ceramic of Chalcis ? If so, it would explain the influences felt in Italy in this period, since despite a problematic Lelantine War at the end of the eighth century, Eretria and Chalcis probably still had considerable influence in the area of their Western colonies. Excavations have never yet been made on the site of ancient Chalcis but some sherds found in the area are close in fabric and decoration to the Boeotian vases.90 The dating of the subgeometric Eretrian amphorae cannot be certain. The 'Boeotian' vases which they most resemble are not securely dated, and their debt to Attica and the FIG. 19.--PANEL DECORATION OF SUBGEOMETRIC GRAVE AMPHORA AI. Cyclades is not so great as to justify dates based on what is mainly only a hypothetical Attic and Cycladic chronology. I do not think that the earliest pieces (AI-3, BI) can be much, if at all earlier than 700, while the end of the series may come down some years into the second half of the seventh century. The general impression is of a local school working in a style common to other centres in the Boeotian-Euboean circle, but also adapting and borrowing motifs from the Cyclades and Attica in its own way. 88 Friihe Griechische Sagenbilder, 20 ff. 89 I list examples of one of the larger seventh century groups in note 80 above. 90 See note 73 above.</page><page sequence="19">POTTERY FROM ERETRIA 19 CATALOGUE: GROUPS A AND B Ax.

For the neck decoration compare vases from Italy 91 betraying strong Boeotian or Euboean influence, and some Cycladic vases.9" The horse is not unlike those of the Ddlos Ad group, and that on the Boeotian amphora Wide, op. cit., fig. 37. The heavy down-pointing rays are a unique method of space filling in a figured panel; those before the horse seem to have been fashioned into a sort of manger. If the object is a manger the horse's indecision whether to walk or gallop seems quite inexplicable.93 On the tripod depicted on the other side of the vase see Benton, BSA XXXV IO06, 107, I Io, fig. I3a (from the drawing in AE 1903 in which there are minor inaccuracies). The fragment showing the dots above the rim is now missing. Az. Eretria. PLATE 3 B, 3. H. of neck 0"07.

In the handle zone the panels on either side of the vase are bounded by two clusters of vertical lines with butterfly ornament in the middle.94 In one panel is preserved part of a spiral and floral 95 ornament, in the other a star, and what may be part of a different floral design or of a horse's mane. Below appear two narrow friezes of clusters of upright wavy lines, then a broad band of thin parallel lines, the rest of the body being simply glazed but for one thin reserved line; the foot is all glazed.

Decorated in a similar style but lacking the high neck characteristic of the series. I could find no more fragments to give a better idea of the profile. Red is used on the lip, on the band above the handle zone and in a broad band on the body. A footed amphora without a high neck in Cambridge (CVA II pl. 15, 8, with lid 7?; PLATE 4) could well also be Eretrian. The grouped wavy lines in narrow friezes on lip and body are not a usual Attic or Boeotian practice,"9 though common in Eretria as we have seen. The unusual foot profile is closely paralleled by the Eretrian incised pithos AE 1903, 18, fig. xo (our no. I above, p. I I).

Clusters of transverse lines on top of the rim. Two broad red bands on the neck outlined by thin white lines, white wavy line over the glazed band at base of neck, thin white lines on the lower part of the body and foot. I group this vase here by reason of its lip and foot profile. The style of neck decoration is paralleled on A5, a close cousin, as is the bar decoration which is more charac- teristic of Group B. This vase and A5 must be about contemporary at the end of subgeometric series. To this list may be added two fragments in Eretria from lips of vases in this group. SECTION III ORIENTALISING SERIES: GROUP C On the latest examples of the subgeometric series we have noticed the use of red and white paint (A5, B6). On a fragment in Athens (CI) just these features appear, with the familiar friezes of upright wavy lines in groups, but with an entirely new lip profile. It illustrates the transition to the orientalising Group C amphorae discussed in this section. The proportions of the amphorae are unchanged and the broad conical foot is familiar from the earliest of the subgeometric series (BI). The double handles of three of the four complete examples (C2, 3, 4, 6) do not meet in a central ridge (above p. 15). The lip has now lost the concave moulding and is no more than a broad flat strip projecting at the top of the neck. Colour is used extensively on vases of this group, but unfortunately has not been well preserved. Red appears in a broad band on the lip (C3, 4), on women's dresses, as inner markings on animals and for the whole body of the sphinx on C6. It is laid directly on the clay in some rays on the lip of C6, the filling crosses of C3 and the ' girdle-ends ' of the women on this vase. I use the word 'white' to describe the painted rosettes and other details. This is merely a convenient expression as I believe that a thin clay wash was usually used which was expected to fire lighter than the background.1'4 Its appearance varies, being sometimes quite white, sometimes yellow, often barely distinguishable from the biscuit except where it accidentally overlies the glaze. Wavy lines in this 'white' appear on or above the shoulder junction of the vase (C2, 4, 6, 8) 105 and on the foot (C4). Laid directly on the clay it is found in the outlined rays on the lip of C6, 7, and on the wing feather of the sphinx on C6; and I suspect the use of a fine wash on the skirts of the women on the same vase. It is used for the inner details of animals on C3, 4, 6, 8. Dot rosettes occur everywhere, on the lips of C3, 4 separated by vertical lines, covering the women's dresses 106 on C3, 4, 6 and the bodies of the animals on C3, 6, 8. Incision is found on only one vase in this group, C6, where it is employed freely to outline the figure on the body and for details. Other vases use thin white lines only. The fragments C8 illustrate the two styles well when compared with C6, a vase painted by the same hand and with the same patterns, but with details and outline incised and not in white as on C8. The painter of these pieces (and of C4, 5, 7), who was certainly the most competent painter in the group, seems responsible for the introduction of the use of incision in Eretria, with what results we shall see in Group D. A similar parallel use of incision and mock incision in white is met on Attic and Cycladic vases.107 104 The practice is known in Attic vase painting from the late Geometric period, when such a wash was often used for details on the plastic snakes attached to vases. o105 Cf. subgeometric A2, B5-6. 106 Cf.

They are grouped in various ways. Usually two face each other, each holding one branch while others attend, either one with a branch (C4, 6), or two with wreaths (C3). There were certainly further variations; for instance, on C8 the figure scene with women seems to have stretched over the handles of the vase, and the triangular ornament on the upper border of C7 suggests that the painter of C4, 6 did not always favour the same arrangement. These figures must surely be of mourners, despite the inscription on C2 which I discuss below. On late Geometric and early Protoattic vases the women (and men) on the necks of vases bearing other funerary scenes of prothesis or funeral games often carry branches.l0s Some sort of ritual dance is no doubt intended. Later, women hold stylised flowers or branches (CVA Berlin I, pl. 23; Vari, BCH i939, pl. 51) but, except perhaps for the latter, we cannot be certain of any funerary significance. We might rather have expected scenes of women raising their hands to their heads to tear their hair.x'9 For the grouping of two women with attendants compare the Eleusis loutrophoros (Kourouniotes, Guide to Eleusis Iio, fig. 56, Jdl 1903, 148, fig. 14) and the women on Attic vases by the Polos Painter."xo C2 presents a different grouping. On the neck and body are three women to the left, holding wreaths or flowers, possibly raising one hand to their heads, possibly with one hand on the shoulder of the woman in front. Unfortunately the condition of the vase leaves in doubt the most interest- ing features. Behind the last woman of the three on the body appears the inscription GEA (FIG. 2Ie). It cannot possibly refer only to the figure to which it is nearest, i.e. the hindmost of the group. If it describes all three we are left with a number of possible identifications among the numerous triads, divine and semi-divine, none of which, however, is really appro- priate in a funerary context. And then, what of the women on the other vases, sometimes grouped in fours, and the three on the neck of the same vase graced only with the single letter [? I believe the inscriptions are rather evidence of the pride of the painter in his literacy and command of letter forms. His is a hand we do not find again on vases of this group. He possibly misunderstood the motif-or could he have had in mind the three Goddesses before Paris, a scene which appears on an Eretrian grave amphora of the mid-sixth century (PLATE 9)? As we have seen, in the subgeometric series the back of the vase was painted with no less care than the front. In Group C only the front is decorated with figured scenes (possible exception on C8), while the back is covered with characteristic Eretrian loop ornament,"' painted in the generous, careless manner equally characteristic of Eretrian painting in this period. Three types of this ornament appear on Eretrian vases (FIG. 20). Type y appears only on vases of Group D. On Cycladic vases this style of decoration is not uncommonly met, particularly on Naxian vases (D'los Ba group and the amphora Thera II 212), but here the ornament is a simple net with no loops. Examples of our types P 112 and y 113 can be found but they never play such a large part. On Attic vases types a and I3 are rare, only type y is at all common."4 Nilsson suggested that Athens learned the motif from Eretria, but the only 108s Hahland, Corolla Curtius, I25 and references. 109 E.g. AM I928, Bell. X. Possibly so on our C2, see below p. 26. 110 Beazley, Hesp. XIII 52, e.g. nos. 20, 2I, 33, 67; the central groups often appear to be holding something. Many were found in the Rheneia Purification grave. 111 Johansen, Vases Sicyoniens, 1 I7; Boehlau, op. cit. II i; Nilsson, Jdl I903, I42.

Only Eretrian painters use these motifs regularly on such a scale, and they may even have adopted the idea independently of Corinth or the East,115 where types P and y are to be found-but it is little to their credit. Type a is peculiar to C2, a vase which in other respects also, as we have seen, stands apart from the rest of this group. In Attic it occurs on the back of the much earlier Burgon krater,116 a Kerameikos oenochoe,'17 and a Berlin krater.'18 There are some fragments in Eretria from vases like our amphorae decorated with coarse net pattern and dots, o (onfCa) 2ThpLc J (r-cup D) Tyypf (&amp;roupC Tqrej?.

Attica and the Cyclades offered models enough for fine striding or crouching sphinxes with slim tall necks and full sickle wings. Our painter has simply spread an animal body across the panel, 115 Corinth: Wuirzburg 756, Langlotz pl. 226; MA XXII 385, fig. 39.

He then added a large female head and a small sickle wing with a single row of large feathers rising incon- gruously from the small of the creature's back. The whole is sprinkled liberally with white rosettes in a manner which would have startled even the boldest Attic painters,120 and would have seemed but little less out of place in the Cyclades. The lion on C4 is of the style of those on the Attic Burgon bowl,12' and might suggest a mid-seventh century date had it appeared on an Attic vase.122 The great mane is peculiar, perhaps suggested by the large painted or reserved shoulders of Cycladic lions.123 Turning now to the subsidiary ornament the influence of both Attica and of the East 124 (no doubt via the Cyclades) can be detected. Quite Attic is the contrast of dark and light in the lip rays of C6, 7, and the use of small dot rosettes for filling ornament.125 Commoner, and with a longer tradition in Attica than in the Cyclades is the diamond motif below the lion on C4.126 We have seen that the loop patterns are a peculiarly Eretrian adaptation of a motif neither specifically Cycladic nor Attic. The elaborate double spiral pattern below the sphinx on C6 and before the lion on C4 is common only on East Greek and Cycladic work of the end of the seventh century,'27 but in Attic it is seldom so elaborate.128 The lip pattern of C3, 4 is common on all fabrics,129 while the herringbone borders of C4, 6 are Cycladic, not Attic.30 Hanging cross-hatched triangles in the field do not usually survive long into the seventh century,la3 and in the Cyclades triangles in this position are usually not so filled, but dissected into triangles and diamonds as in our Group D. The figure drawing offers few parallels. The shape of the animals' bodies is Attic of the mid-seventh century; Cycladic creatures, mostly later, bear more plausible proportions. The women are not unlike those on a Boeotian relief pithos,x32 and in Attic work of the last decades of the century; '3 the heads are close to those on the Melian Apollo amphora, and the Berlin fragment.l34 The vases of this group, then, offer us some details and styles in figure drawing which we might well expect of mid-seventh century Attic, but beside them other characteristics more fitting for painting of the end of that century. The same juxtaposition of new motifs with others long out of fashion on the mainland can be observed on Cycladic vases of this period, and just as we have found so many Cycladic touches in Eretrian work, so it is with an eye to Cycladic chronology that the Eretrian orientalising series should be dated. The dating of Cycladic vases, and for that matter of East Greek pottery also, has usually been determined by their relation to Attic and Corinthian chronology, themselves still disputed. This procedure I believe to be unjustifiable. Cycladic vase-painting went its own way in the seventh century. Parallels can be drawn with mainland work, but they are slight and unimportant; the whole 120 BSA XXXV 195.

It kept to its own way into the sixth century when Corinthian influence and eventually Attic production drove it even from its local markets-in Delos. The Rheneia finds tell the story quite clearly. It borrowed details and motifs which were often long out of fashion in their mainland homes, but the technique and style of figure drawing remained quite Cycladic. In fact the Attic work of the seventh century was so unruly that it never favoured one clear style long enough for it to be imitated by its neighbours, and was in fact hardly at all exported. Features borrowed by Boeotia and the islands, more conservative in their vase painting, might linger there for as much as fifty years after they ceased to be popular in Athens. The last successful Cycladic fabric before the Attic invasion was 'Melian', and as our Group C (and D) Eretrian vases fall chronologically within the period of the popularity of this fabric, it would not, I think, be inappropriate to look to Melian chronology to suggest dates for Eretrian work.135 'Melian' vases have been found on very many Greek sites,'3" but the greatest body of material is from the Rheneia Purification graves. These vases, in the Mykonos Museum, are still largely unpublished, but the larger grave amphorae,'37 which illustrate the series from its beginning until nearly its close, and some of the Mykonos examples, are published and suffice to give an overall picture of the fabric. I suggest below an approximate chronological sequence of some of the published pieces.'38 i. The Riders Amphora. Pfuhl, MuZ III, fig. 105.

The series seems to represent a considerable ceramic activity for hardly more than half a century, at a time when the Cyclades were producing practically nothing else.141 In so far as parallels can be drawn with mainland work, the heads on the human figures of the latter vases of my list above bear a closer resemblance to Middle or Late Corinthian work 142 than to Early Corinthian,143 wherein the sharper profiles are more like the drawing on such Melian pieces as the Apollo Amphora. The magnificent lion on the Berlin fragment would hardly disgrace the Chimaera Group,144 while the fine proportions of the deer held by Artemis on the Apollo Amphora ill accord with a suggested dating to the first half of the seventh century. The small dot rosettes in the field and the frieze above the body scene on the Apollo Amphora are a feature of Transitional Corinthian, in Attic of the Nessos vase (Pfuhl op. cit., figs. 85, 89), and of our C6 which is probably a contemporary. The most Corinthianising Melian animals meet their opposites on Middle Corinthian vases. But these similarities may be only echoes or coincidence. The earlier 'Melian' animal style learned much from East Greece where pottery is still insecurely dated. A fuller chronological analysis of East Greek ornament would also help. The elaborate double spiral motif as filling ornament seems to have been affected in the East (the earliest ' Rhodian' plates) at about the same time as in Attica (the Piraeus amphora, Pfuhl, op. cit. fig. 88), in one 'Melian' style (the Apollo Amphora), and probably in Eretria (C4 and 6 and cf. DI). Where then do the Eretrian Group C amphorae stand in relation to the Melian series which probably flourished from about 630 to 580 or even later? The central pieces of the group, C4, 6, suggest, from their use of incision, dot rosettes, and sharp profiles, the time of the Apollo Amphora, i.e. the Nessos Painter's period in Athens. The vases were probably all made in the last quarter of the seventh century, late pieces such as C2 are possibly to be dated after 6oo00. The further possibility, that the earliest examples of Group D (DI) chronologically overlap the latest of Group C, is discussed below. Of the following list C4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are by one hand, and perhaps C3 is an earlier work by the same man. The Louvre jug, CI2, is added here to the list of grave amphorae for its obvious similarities in style. CATALOGUE: GROUP C CI. Athens NM Apotheke. PLATE 5. H. 0'24.

Red was used on the headdresses of the women and probably on their cloaks; white, in a wavy line at the base of the neck, possibly outlining the body rays and the leaves beneath the handles, and on the foot which is very carelessly painted, the glaze in places not entirely covering the surface. The surface has suffered considerably and appears a pale buff beside the orange-red of the other amphorae. To the right of the body panel is the inscription SEA; the exact form of the last letter is not distinct (FIG. 2we). A four-stroke epsilon appears in the field behind the head of the second woman in the neck panel.145 The leading figure on the neck holds a dot wreath. Similar rosettes before the other two women may also be taken as wreaths, while the lines running obliquely across the neck of the first and second women may be their arms. The second and third figures also seem to be resting one hand on the shoulder of the woman before them. In the body scene the leading woman again holds a wreath and her other arm may be represented by the line across her neck. The second woman raises her arm in the same way, and the last seems to be holding a flower. The rosettes and lines of dots between the figures are only filling. This vase stands somewhat apart from the rest of Group C, and is not the earliest in the group. Its figure style, representation of women on both neck and body, rays,146 handle decoration, and loop ornament on the back (type a, above p. 22) are not met on other 141 Except perhaps in Naxos, e.g. the Aphrodite vase (JdI I937, i66 ff.), probably not much earlier than the Apollo Amphora. 142 Cf.

The women each raise an arm in a gesture of adoration towards the snake. The painter forgot to give the woman on the right any feet. The upright wavy lines behind the women would have suggested themselves naturally to any Eretrian painter. The shape derives from the familiar geometric jug with broad high neck and, usually, no foot.153 The shape is known in Attic down to the middle of the seventh century, but recurs again once in a black figure example of about 600 in the Kerameikos."4 Our vase is probably a provincial contemporary from a hand which had not yet learned the new black figure technique. The vase was certainly a grave offering.

The almost flat lip-moulding of the preceding group has degenerated into a deep concave groove. Incision is now employed freely and carelessly, but the traditional style of outline drawing is retained for lions' heads, and red paint is applied lavishly both on the bodies of the animals, and directly on the surface of the vase.155 On D2 alone is incision only used for the details on the animal's bodies, and DIo is in a simple silhouette style. The figure decoration consists of animals, lions, sphinxes, or swans, grouped heraldically in pairs over a rosette or a half palmette. Above the body panel there is often a band of red and black rays, the interspaces being either left blank (D4, 6), or filled with crude silhouette birds x156 (DI, 2, 3, 5) or rosettes 157 (D7). The back of the vase is decorated, on the neck with upright wavy lines, on the body with crude loop patterns liberally interspersed with dots, both of type P (DI, 2, 9, Io) which is common in Group C, and type y (D3, 4, 5). Wherever the foot is preserved it is decorated with a band of large hanging hooks. On most of these vases the drawing is so gross as to make comparison with the animals of any respectable fabric impossible. However one vase, DI, shows that there was in Eretria at least one painter competent to hold a brush at this time. The elaborate double spiral filling devices and the spiral and palmette complex between the lions on the body suggest that this piece (PLATE 8) is probably the earliest of the group, and may well be a work of the last years of the seventh century, in other words possibly earlier than the latest vases of Group C. The neat incision and drawing of the animals, palmettes and filling ornament is not met again in Group D, the other vases of which are simply degenerate variations on the same theme. Animals grouped heraldically in pairs over a central floral motif are common on Melian vases, and the quarter palmettes in the corners of the panels are found most often on East Greek work. The bands of alternating red and black rays are paralleled on Boeotian bird kylixes 158 and in the Cyclades.159 The crude loop decoration of both types P3 and y 160 have been discussed above (p. 21 f.). The rows of heavy hooks on the feet of Eretrian Group D amphorae are most unusual; similar ornament appears on some vases found in Attica, but not certainly Attic,161 and on a Cycladic group which I mention further below. The filling ornament is met commonly in the Cyclades, but the hanging triangles, the double spiral patterns (e.g. DI) and framed dots and crosses all own more respectable Cycladic and mainland counter- parts.162 The group is probably of the opening decades of the sixth century, corresponding to the 155 A habit often considered barbarous, but one which invariably seems to have ensured the better preservation of the colour.

Beyond this and in this style Eretrian painters could not, and fortunately did not, attempt to go. Other styles were affected (DIo, PLATE 8), but the evidence of excavation so far has revealed no other ceramic activity in Eretria until its Atticising black figure and the fine mid-century amphorae dealt with in the following section. A small group of vases from Rheneia call for some attention here by reason of their similarity to Eretrian work of this period. They are nos. 23-27 of Ddlos group C,163 and stand apart from the rest of that group in many respects. Their clay is buff-orange, some vases show a very little mica in the clay, and no slip is used. We have seen already in Eretria the use of red paint in bands and on alternate palmette leaves, applied directly on the surface of the vase, the rows of hanging hooks, the white rosettes along a dark band (e.g. on CI2), the rays with birds in the interspaces and the absence of slip. I do not suggest that these vases are Eretrian; they are more carefully painted than any vases of this period found in Eretria, but they stand closer to Eretrian work in technique and motifs than to the earlier Naxian work with which they are associated in the publication, and they may hail from a nearby centre.

In Boeotia in the first half of the century a silhouette geometricising style 170 was in fashion, but offers nothing on this scale.

From their unusual lip profiles and the unnatural and ugly bulge at the centre of the neck I take them to be examples of a degeneration of the usual Eretrian amphora shape, and certainly of the sixth century. Also in Athens, fragments from the lower part of amphorae decorated with rays, in one case with rays in two tiers, and from the feet of amphorae with clusters of crudely drawn upright wavy lines. SECTION V BLACK FIGURE Laurent, in AE 19O01, 175, published a full description of the three black figure grave amphorae excavated by Kourouniotes in 1898. To his description I need add little. They do, however, merit further discussion on their shape, figured decoration, and position in the history of Greek vase painting of the sixth century. I shall refer to them as the Wedding Amphora (PLATES 9, I I), the Herakles Amphora (PLATES, IO, I I), and the Peleus Amphora (PLATE 9).172 The Herakles and Peleus Amphorae were found to contain the skeletons of children; a form of burial which, as we have seen, was practised in Eretria at least from the beginning of the seventh century (see above p. 13). The shapes of the vases also illustrate their debt to seventh century practice, for they have the same high necks, feet and double handles which appear on the subgeometric amphorae of Groups A and B, and which were, of course, features of a vase-form popular in many Greek archaic fabrics.17 Only in Eretria, however, does this form live so long, and among vases decorated in the Attic black figure style of the sixth century it is only in Eretria that it is found. But by this time Attic vase painting has swept nearly all other individual fabrics from the market, and has imposed its own black figure style on most other provincial vase-painting schools. So, in Eretria, these vases are painted, possibly by an Eretrian hand, but in a purely Attic style, distinguishable from true Athenian work only in details. These, the most important and valuable vases made in Eretria at this period, are also probably for that reason the most Attic in style; other black figure work of Eretria pub- lished in Section VI below betrays the provincial hand more clearly. Eretrian features in the painting will be discussed later; for the moment consider the shapes of the vases. Their debt to earlier Eretrian wares has been noticed, but now, just as the decoration has become Attic, so many details in the shapes of the vases remind one of an Attic sixth century vase form, the so-called lebes gamikos, a name which might well be applied to the Eretrian amphorae, had they not the characteristically Eretrian high necks. Two of the amphorae also depict wedding scenes, which are almost the rule on lebetes gamikoi. A vase shape, then, popular all over Greece in the seventh century in connection with burial practice, survives still in Eretria in the middle of the sixth century, when it shows characteristics peculiar to an Attic vase shape especially associated with marriage, whose history can be traced back some little way independently of the Eretrian series. This is not really paradoxical, but the problem does suggest some points which deserve notice. Marriage scenes with a divine couple in a chariot, appearing on footed amphorae with high necks and double handles, are known from the last decades of the seventh century in 167 Beazley, Hesk. XIII 52. 168 MonPiot I, pl. 4; Boehlau, op. cit. pl. 12, 4, 5. e169 Dilos X, pl. 5, 33. 170o JHS I929, 160 f., pll. 9-I3. 171 Dugas, Ceramique des Cyclades 199 f.: De'los Ba, Bc2, i6, 17, C2I. 172 Other literature, Pfuhl, MuZ I 206; Dugas, Milanges Holleaux 76. 173 See above p. 13 f.</page><page sequence="31">POTTERY FROM ERETRIA 31 Cycladic, Melian and Naxian work,174 and perhaps even on the Protoattic Kynosarges Amphora.'"75 In Attic black figure such scenes are common, and are discussed further below (P. 34 f., 39)- The earliest complete example of an Attic lebes gamikos is of the Sophilos period. It was found in the British School excavations at Smyrna in I949.176 The shape is very similar to that of the later lebetes gamikoi, but it has only single handles. It bears the scene of a wedding procession. There are few and fragmentary examples only as far as the middle of the century. They seem most popular with black figure painters in the red figure period at the end of the sixth century. Red figure examples appear first in the Early Classical Period and are popular throughout the fifth century.'77 The name and purpose of this vase shape is still uncertain. The name was given on the evidence of temple inscriptions of the second half of the fourth century referring to bronze vessels.'78 It has been suggested that it held water for the bridal bath, scented water, or breakfast for the newly wedded couple.'79 No suggestion seems compatible with quite all the varied representations of it on red figure vases, where it appears being carried in the bridal procession on the wedding day,'80 with the Epaulia on the following day,'s' standing outside the closed door of the bridal suite,1s82 used as a flower pot,s83 wrapped in a rug,184 held by the bride on her lap,1s85 and in one case piled one on top of another before the bride by a servant.186 Two of the Eretrian vases, the Wedding and Peleus Amphorae, bear wedding scenes, which are regular on Attic lebetes gamikoi; and one, the Wedding Amphora, has also a scene of the Judgement of Paris, which appears on the Petit Palais lebes gamik.os.s87 The Eretrian lip mouldings are similar to those of the earliest Attic lebetes gamikoi.188 The upright double handles close to the neck, the moulding at the base of the body and the high feet are the same.'"89 The diamond-shaped lozenge added at the junction of the double handles of the Peleus Amphora is found on lebetes gamikoi from Delos and in the British Museum,19o and on many red figure examples.

Hence, no doubt, the late fragments from the Kerameikos cemetery 191 with mourning women depicted, vases certainly not originally carried in any marriage procession, but perhaps made for the funeral of an unmarried girl.192 Two of the three Eretrian amphorae were found to contain the bodies of infants. Savage the mother who interred her unfortunate or unwanted young in a vessel which once held the water for her bridal bath--or breakfast! The explanation must be that the potter threw a vase shape, Attic in all details but for the traditionally high Eretrian neck, and the painters, Attic trained, decorated it with scenes they knew to be appropriate on similar vases made in Athens, without regard to the eventual use of the amphora in Eretria. In the course of the individual description of the amphorae which follows, the details in the painting and in the mythological scenes which suggest that the work is not by Athenian hands will be noted. In Section VI these details, and others suggested by other black figure vases from Eretria, will be considered in the light of the possibility of a recognisable local Eretrian school of vase painting. I believe that these three vases were painted by men who were trained or had worked in Athens, or if not in Athens, in some other Attic vase-painting centre. The non-Athenian elements in their work are their own, and in so far as they are manifest in each vase and in other black figure work from Eretria, they are Eretrian.

The vase is described at length in the Collignon-Couve Catalogue but the ivy branch held by Dionysos and the wreath carried by the bride are not noticed. The colours are remarkably well preserved, and the lavish use of white and red lends an effect of polychromy rivalled in Attic work only by the gaudier Tyrrhenian vases. Incision is employed only in the scenes involving human figures on the neck and body on the front of the vase. The painting is an essay in the Athenian style by an artist who did not fully understand his originals, and who at the same time introduced details which are not Athenian into his work. The himatia of Hermes, Dionysos and Peleus hang at back and front in an un-Athenian manner,'93 the proportions of the siren, filling the panel on the back of the vase, have suffered with her enlargement. The fearless and colourful procession of three and a half bulls below the main scene, the friezes of birds above the neck panel and the rear body panel,'9" and the use of white paint everywhere for the inner markings of animals, add to the non-Athenian appearance of the vase, while yet other unfamiliar details are matched also on other black figure vases from Eretria-the white sepals in the floral chains on the lid and body,'95 the ivy leaves springing from the floors of friezes or panels, even the indecision of the heraldic lions on the back whether they should be sejant or passant.'96 Add to this the shape of the vase and its unusual details in the figured scenes, and the Wedding Amphora offers a compendium of Athenian styles of decoration executed in the Eretrian manner-two major figured scenes, 191 Jdl 1946/7, pl. 23, 78, 79. 192 Hesychius and others say that loutrophoroi stand above the graves of unmarried people. Judging by the number of loutrophoroi, terracotta, marble and in relief, found in Attic cemeteries the proportion of the population who died unmarried might seem a little strange. So-called lebetes gamikoi, found in tombs and with scenes of mourning upon them, might better qualify for the name loutrophoros, which is also associated with marriage by Hesychius and others. But further enquiry into this problem is beyond the scope of this study. e193 Cf. Thiersch, Tyrrhenische Amphoren I 13, I 15. 194 Rare in Attic but cf.

To turn to details. The naive manner in which the glaze outline to the cloaks of the three women beyond the horses follows the profile of their faces instead of dropping straight down is paralleled by the similar glaze outline to the gorgons' ears on the Gorgon Amphora and Hydria (p. 40, nos. 2, 3).198 Their 'bun' hair style 199 and red dot eyes 200 are Attic. Compared with such horses as those of Acr. 610 and 627 those of this vase are less lively animals but as well proportioned.201 The heraldic lions on the back of the neck are purely Attic in concep- tion,202 but the lack of incision and extraordinary and lavish use of colour give them a most un-Attic appearance. The form of the siren in the body panel below is like that on an oenochoe in the Agora,203a and the paddle tail is quite Attic. The way in which the feathers on her body are represented by small curved lines in white is unusual, though similar incised decoration is found in Attic,204 and particularly in Etruscan black figure vases.205 It appears again in Eretria on the siren below the left handle of the Herakles Amphora. The ivy leaves which spring on stalks from the floor of the rear body panel and the foot frieze are again most easily paralleled on Etruscan vases.206 Similar decoration on Chalcidian, pseudo-Chalcidian 207 and some Attic vases 208 consists usually of a lotus bud or bloom on a stalk, as on the Herakles Amphora (FIG. 22); on the foot of this vase also appear two ivy leaves like those on the Wedding Amphora. The degenerate floral chain above the body scene, with its members connected by links not tendrils, and with lotus and palmette in pairs and not alternating, seems in a more advanced style than that in the same position on the Herakles vase (PLATE IO). The lotus-palmette cross on the foot shows Tyrrhenian proportions, and the white dot fringe to the palmette is quite Attic.209 A central sepal may be represented by a white paint line, but a complete lack of incision makes it difficult to assign it its position in the known Attic development of the type.210 The scene of the Judgement of Paris 211 is remarkable mainly for Paris' patient attitude 197 Note also that the body scene is not accurately centred, but on the right extends under the handles. 198 Amyx, A.JA I94, 69. 199 Cf. .7HS IqxsI, pl.

D</page><page sequence="34">34 JOHN BOARDMAN before Hermes and the goddesses. In all contemporary and earlier representations he displays no little reluctance. On Chalcidian 212 vases he seems diffident, and only on the Corinthian Chigi 213 vase does he seem at all contented or resigned to his lot. We should probably identify Hera with her sceptre as the foremost of the goddesses.214 The scene of the Judgement of Paris is not rarely found on Attic vases which also bear scenes of a wedding procession.215 Scenes of a wedding procession,216 with the groom carrying his bride home in a chariot, are common on Attic vases. In some details the representation on this vase differs from the usual Attic type. Neither here nor on the Peleus Amphora (PLATE 9) appear the booted Hermes or lyre-playing Apollo, the two most regular attendants in Attic scenes, who, however, never appear on similar Corinthian scenes. On the other hand the woman playing the flutes does not appear on Attic vases.217 The two small sirens flying below and before the horses may be regarded as birds of good omen.218s On some black figure examples the bride and groom can be identified as a divine or heroic couple, and Peleus and Thetis, whose marriage was so often celebrated in song and art (cf. the Frangois Vase), were most popular.219 Many scenes we may regard as already secularised, as of a mortal couple, and identify the figures of the Gods as those of mortal guests and attendants; thus, Hermes the rponyrl-rnS, Artemis holding torches as the mother of the bride or groom,220 lyre-playing Apollo the accompanist to the marriage hymn, Dionysos a satisfied father-in-law. But other deities sometimes appear who cannot be so easily explained-Zeus, Hera,221 Athena,222 Poseidon,223 Herakles,224 and others.225 Peleus and Thetis were popular in Eretria and we may identify them as the newly wedded couple here."6 Possibly it is Aphrodite 227 who follows Dionysos as wedding guest, and Artemis-Hekate or Hera who holds the torches.228 The group of three women is common 212 Rumpf CV Io8, pl. 114, 150 and pl. 134.

As the dispute between the goddesses which occasioned the Judgement was initiated by Eris while they were attending the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, and as that dispute directly caused the Trojan War, the connection, with the Judgement, of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, or of the warrior (Menelaus ?) leading away his bride (Helen?) is easily understood. 216 Haspels, BCH I930, 431 f.; Payne NC 1 I4, nn. 3, 4, 5. 217 Acr. 2203, Graef pl. 93 seems to be of a later stage in the ceremony when the bride is being led to her nuptial bed. 218 Laurent, op. cit., notices only one siren; ADelt I890, 50, no.

I would date this vase to about the middle of the sixth century. Dr. Amyx has suggested that the Herakles Amphora should be earlier than this vase, and such details as the more degenerate lotus and palmette chain on the Wedding Amphora might support his contention. In my opinion they are near contemporaries, and inasmuch as the Wedding Amphora imitates an earlier Athenian style of painting, more Sakonidean than Exekian, it was probably made earlier. Two fragments from Eretria,230 one, PLATE IO, are from a grave amphora painted in a similar style to that of the back of the Wedding Amphora (the least Attic part of the vase in appearance), but more crudely and no doubt of an earlier date. They are from the neck of the amphora; in a panel reserved in the glaze appear the tail and legs of a bird, possibly another siren. Note the similar use of white paint on the tail in the fragment, and on the siren of the Wedding Amphora. I cannot identify the object on the smaller fragment; in the field is part of a swastika.

Laurent describes the vase fully; most of the traces of colour are still visible. It was found containing the bones of an infant, with two lekythoi and two kyathiskoi which cannot now be identified. Of the lid all that is preserved is the knob, the band of rays, and at one point the semicircular stalks linking the buds in the band below; the rest is restored in plaster, perhaps with rather too low a profile. The slender proportions of the Wedding Amphora are now lost. The neck is shorter and the shoulder set off more markedly, while the handles stand very close to the neck. Incision is employed only sparingly on the back of the vase and not at all on the foot. The lowest zone of the body probably by oversight lacks the rays found in that position on the other two black figure grave amphorae.231 The painting is a far more convincing imitation of Attic of the period of early Exekias or the E Group. A comparison between the head of Herakles on our vase and on the Attic Louvre F53 232 (FIG. 23b) shows that the Eretrian painter copied his models closely but not carefully, and in his very lack of care imparted a considerable vigour to his work. The execu- tion of the lion and bull standing in the animal frieze below Herakles (PLATE I I) may not be precise, but is confident and most successful, and the proportions of the monster and composition of the main scene on the vase make it the most satisfactory representation of Heracles and the Hydra in black figure painting.233 Unusual characteristics shared by other vases from Eretria are the use of white for the sepals in the floral chain on the body and the chain of buds on the foot,234 the ivy leaves and lotuses on stalks rising from the floors of the animal friezes, the debased tongue ornament above 229 Payne NC nos.

The device between the panthers, where both parts are a lotus, is less usual, the normal Attic formula being lotus and palmette.242 Two ivy leaves on stalks such as appear on the Wedding Amphora,243 rise from the floor of the frieze on the foot, but lotuses on stalks, a more Attic motif,244 also appear on this vase, two by the siren below the right handle. Their angular buds could not be more unlike Chalcidian. By the legs of the siren beneath the other handle a palmette plant grows (FIG. 2 Ib), an unusual motif at this date but met on pseudo-Chalcidian and Chalcidian vases.245 The neck decoration above and behind each of the handles (FIG. 2 If) seems a half-hearted attempt at the more elaborate floral and spiral motifs by the handles of Attic vases. The birds below were awkwardly painted through the loops of the double handles which frame them.246 The white sepals to the lotuses in the floral friezes will receive attention later.247 The row of unlinked lotuses and buds on the foot are most closely paralleled by the neck decoration of amphorae in Mykonos and from Tanagra; cf. also a Delos plate, whose other Eretrian affinities are discussed below (p. 45, PLATE 14). In the scene of Herakles' fight with the Hydra 248 there are some variations from the usual Attic type. The woman with the branch may well be Athena, but neither she nor Hermes appears often in such scenes on Attic vases; 249 nor are the other women spectators met, and though Herakles often wields a sword Iolaos does so only once.250 The Eretrian Hydra is one of the finest monsters Herakles had ever to face.25' We miss the traditional crab, but for the chariot which von Massow would associate with the scene we need look no further than the neck of the vase.252 Admittedly it already carries its charioteer 253 while Iolaos is helping Herakles. But this Iolaos is no mere 'chauffeur', witness his fine armour with the panther heads at the shoulders; in all probability the heads are really at the front but the painter prefers to make them visible on Iolaos' back.254 The Herakles Amphora is of around the middle of the sixth century, probably only a little after the Wedding Amphora.255 240 See above p. 33. 241 Rumpf CV pl. 63, cf. pl. 82. 242 TWO lotuses: Attic, AJA 1944, 253, fig. 3 (this piece is an uneasy addition to the Sakonidean vases: the palmette device behind the sirens' wings is most uncommon at this period-it appears on a vase in Mykonos), Fouilles de Delphes, V 144, fig. 596 (upside down: a siren), Thiersch, op. cit. 85, fig. 28; Boeotian, Ure, Sixth and Fifth Cent.

Preserved height 0"55, not as recorded by Laurent and Nicole. Athens NM I6184; Nilsson, Jdl I903, I38, fig. Io; Amyx, AJA I941, 69, n. 38. The foot NM 16184 which was published by Nilsson as from Eretria has now been joined to the Peleus Amphora which Laurent published. Laurent wrote 256 that the foot could not be found at the excavation, and its independent arrival in the National Museum therefore remains a mystery. The amphora contained the bones of an infant. The drawing on the vase is a stiff and less successful imitation of good Attic work of 550- 540. Compare the horses by Lydos,257 and note the way the Eretrian painter has disturbed their proportions. It is, however, a more slavish imitation of Attic, and there is little beyond the shape of the vase which is not Attic in inspiration. The splaying tail to the siren in the animal frieze on the lid is unusual.258 The geese in the bottom frieze on the foot are reminiscent of an earlier animal frieze style,259 while the other animals are more in the style of those on Attic band cups. The diagonal folds in the mantles of the figures on the neck run in either direction.260 The step decoration on the lip is more Corinthian or even Chalcidian in origin than Attic. In the floral frieze the lotus type (best seen in BCH 1930, pl. 23) may betray a slip in the painter's Atticism. In all black figure fabrics the calyx of a lotus of this type is usually boxed off from the sepals by a transverse line or lines.26"' When the outer sepals run straight to the stem there is usually a simple central sepal between them, and not a palmette as here. This is perhaps an oversight or a misunderstanding on the part of the painter. In the inscriptions the second stroke of the lambda in fIEA(E(S), as read by Laurent, sprang from the bottom of the first stroke, the form regular on most known Eretrian archaic inscrip- tions.262 The break is parallel to and just beside the first stroke of the letter, and the position of the second stroke cannot now be seen clearly. The first letter of the preserved part of the name of the man greeting the wedded couple presents some difficulty. As it stands it is an Ionic lambda. The name clearly should read NEpeGS, the father of Thetis, who on the Francois Vase stands with his wife Doris welcoming the wedding guests. Various things may have suggested the name Neleus to the painter, apart from the simple possibility of his ignorance, which no doubt helped. There is a river Neleus in Euboea; 263 Peisistratos who was ruling in Athens, perhaps while the painter was learning his trade there and who himself came to Eretria,264 claimed descent from Neleus. Or this spelling may perhaps be a misguided attempt to avoid the local habit of rhotacism. In any of these cases the letter form is deliberate. If the painter intended to write Nepe6iS and this is a misspelling the form is still deliberate; only if it were an unfinished letter, a / for a PF', could the appearance of the unusual I lambda form in Eretria be explained. Of all explanations the misspelling seems most likely and the nationality of the painter is perhaps thereby called into question. 256 AE Igor, 178. I have not seen the complete vase as the foot had not yet been unpacked from its place of wartime storage when I left Athens. Mrs. Karouzou kindly sent me the photographs, which I publish here (PLATE 9), confirming my assumption. Amyx had noted that the animals on the foot were painted by the same hand as those on the lid of the Peleus Amphora. The knob on the lid is missing.

The lebetes carried by the two women are interesting.265 Perhaps these are in fact the lebetes gamikoi, as it is difficult to see what presents they might hold, although they could of course be presents themselves- cooking utensils.266 Presents were usually brought on the day following the wedding, the Epaulia,267 while in the procession as figured here were carried flat boxes,268 no doubt con- taining linen, or the symbolic ?iKvov.269 The lebetes appear large and it is tempting to suppose that they are empty, and that their value was sentimental on account of their previous use possibly at the bridal bath. This is the latest and least inspired of the extant Eretrian grave amphorae. It belongs to the decade 550-540, and probably not late in it. SECTION VI A. OTHER BLACK FIGURE POTTERY FROM ERETRIA In this section is published a list of all important black figure vases and fragments found in Eretria with which I am acquainted; also one attribution by Dr. Amyx which I regard as certain (no. 3).270 Non-Athenian and possibly local characteristics are mentioned in the course of the description of the vases, but I have reserved for the end a discussion of the possi- bility of a recognisable Eretrian school of black figure vase painting, and the existence of other vases akin to the non-Attic black figure vases found in Eretria. Except for the two fragmentary pieces (nos. I I, 12) I have ignored all black figure lekythoi in Eretria or in the Eretria apotheke in the National Museum.27" I. The Silen Amphora (PLATE 12).

Dohrn for some photographs. 271 See further below p. 45.

The high neck, flaring lip, angular handles and large field for the figured panels are not quite Attic, but, judged by Attic standards, and in view of the rays at the base, this vase could hardly have been made before 570. The awkward style of figure drawing does not permit any close parallels with Attic work, and the painter clearly was not very familiar with the Attic vase painting which he was laboriously imitating. We have seen how skilfully painters working in Eretria could imitate and adapt Athenian models of about 550, so it seems probable that the vase was made before the three great grave amphorae, though probably only a little before. The doe with its head pulled back suggested to Rumpf the animals on the Berlin Lydos oenochoe,275 and it is certainly the most advanced feature on the vase. In the silen's head, to which the painter has imparted strikingly brutish features, Buschor sees the father of the Frangois Vase silens. It is more of a distant cousin, I think, or even in a more direct relationship with the Ionian type of Silen with human legs but horse's hoofs, which is almost unknown in Attic work,276 but regular on Chalcidian vases.276" Horse protomai with forelegs showing, as on the shield device on this vase, do not appear on Attic work until later; coins, however, with this device, of the period of our vase or even earlier, have been associated with Euboea and some found in Euboea.277 Not Attic: probably Eretrian. 2.

Rehm (CVA Bonn 47) notes the Boeotian affinities in the inscription, and discusses the measure suggested by hEy irplr(ov). These black figure fragments and the grave amphorae offer few features which are so unlike Attic that they might be called distinctively Eretrian. Only the less important and so less deliberately Atticising parts of the grave amphorae, e.g. the back of the Wedding Amphora (PLATE 9), may betray the provincial hand: and among the other vases the Gorgon Amphora and Hydria (nos. 2 and 3 above). Particularly noteworthy is the persistent use of white paint for the sepals of lotuses, the pairs of sepals being linked in one continuous line-admittedly known but by no means common in Attic painting. Other characteristics are the ivy leaves in the field on the Wedding and Herakles Amphorae, and the unlinked row of lotuses and buds on the foot of the Herakles Amphora. In technique the use of a glaze wash over the back- ground of figured scenes, as on the Silen Amphora (and I suspect its presence on the grave amphorae), is not uncommon on Boeotian vases; the clay also, with occasional flecks of chalky white, is close to Boeotian. On the most distinctive shape of the grave amphorae see above p. 13 f.; vases of a very similar type are known from fragments from the Athenian acropolis 292 and in Eleusis,293 but there is no evidence for the characteristically Eretrian high neck. Of Chalcidian influence there is really no sign,294 and the few points of similarity are probably coincidental.295 If Chalcidian vases were made in Chalcis this is certainly to be wondered at. The close Chalcidian parallels to the lekanis fragment (above p. 42 no. I6) are interesting but not significant. The connections with Etruscan black figure are reminiscent of the earlier Euboean- Italian problems noted above p. 17. Any direct influence, one way or the other, between Eretria and Italy is most unlikely at this period, and the similarities 296 are again probably only coincidental. A considerable number of attributions to Eretrian black figure have been made, in par- ticular soon after the discovery of the grave amphorae.297 A measure of the popularity of 290 AE 1896, 244 ft. It is interesting to note that this type of skyphos has been connected with Eretria by Amyx, cf. Bonn AA 1935, 472, no. 37, Mannheim Cg '49. 291x Kretschmer, Gr. Vaseninschriften, 79. The -Ea would normally be -Ea in Attic, but there are exceptions, Kretschmer, op. cit. 130. The doubling of the A, as in (a), occurs in Attic only on the later vase inscriptions. 292 E.g.

Zahn, in PhW I902, 126I ff., suggests an Eretrian origin for a number of the Louvre vases which are either Attic or perhaps local Italian imitations of Attic.298 In the Graef-Langlotz publication of the sherds from the Athenian acropolis attributions are made by Zahn and others. Acr. 471 299 is the best Attic parallel to the ivy leaves on the Wedding and Herakles Amphorae (p. 37), and Eretrian work might be suspected in the peculiar silhouette style, interlace ornament and use of glaze wash on Acr. 413.300 The fragments Acr. 24oo00,301 called Eretrian by Zahn, illustrate well the Attic style closely imitated by the painter of the Wedding Amphora (PLATE 9). The other attributed Acropolis sherds may well not be Athenian, but bear no particular resemblance to any black figure from Eretria.a02 Of other vases, at other times both in CVA and museum catalogues called Eretrian or of the ' Euboean circle', most interesting are the so-called 'Andrian' vases.303 These are a small class of alabastra with unusual cylindrical profiles employing much colour and a glaze wash over the background, as do some Boeotian and Eretrian vases. They seem not to be Boeotian, and are closely allied to Eretrian work. The other most reasonable attributions are mentioned by Dr. Amyx.304 They are an amphora in Mykonos from the Rheneia Purification grave 305 (Inv. KA 1028; PLATE 14), an amphora from Tanagra (Athens NM 2635; PLATE I4), and a plate from the Delos Heraion (Ddlos X, no. 637, pl. 52). The Mykonos neck-amphora 306 (PLATE I4) bears on the neck an unlinked row of red buds and black lotuses with white sepals painted directly on the background. This back- ground is very dull and probably covered by a thin glaze wash. On either side between the sirens and the panthers is a simple lotus and palmette complex. The neck-amphora from Tanagra (PLATE I4) 307 has similar neck decoration to that on the Mykonos vase, with the same white-painted sepals in the lotuses. In the crude floral chain on the body the lotuses again bear white sepals. The plate in Delos (Ddlos X, no. 637, pl. 52) has a similar row of lotuses with white sepals, in an unlinked chain with alternate buds, running around its rim. Its profile is not a common Attic one,308s and the only example of this type among the Delos plates. The style of figure drawing is very close to that of the Gorgons on the Gorgon Amphora and Hydria. The white-painted sepals on these three vases have been noted as a feature of Eretrian painting also, and the rows of unlinked buds and lotuses are paralleled only by those on the 298 Louvre E 735 is interesting.

Such decoration is not found on Attic amphorae or plates, but is met on some smaller vases, mostly lekythoi, which may not be Athenian or even Attic (below p. 47). These features, the drawing of the figure on the Delos plate, the carelessly un-Attic drawing of the animals, particularly the panthers on the Mykonos vase, and the use of a glaze wash on the same vase, all suggest an Eretrian origin, or at least a nearby centre for the origin of these three vases. Other finds in nearby Boeotia or the islands might prove to be Eretrian. In Boeotia local styles can be distinguished and much Attic work was both imported and imitated (on lekythoi see below p. 47), but the occasional vase such as BSA XIV, pl. 17, 50. 267 suggests with its colour and scant incision a style neither Boeotian nor Attic. Some of the plates on Delos, other than no. 637 (above), seem non-Attic, the white sepals in the lotuses of the exergue of Dilos X, no. 63o, pl. 51 being noteworthy. Of the vases from Rheneia in Mykonos, four, apart from the neck amphora PLATE 14, bear these same characteristic white sepals in the lotuses, one in an unlinked floral chain. But these examples, with the 'Andrian' vases mentioned above, may only represent the work of other non-Attic centres, perhaps close to Eretria geographically and imitating Attic painting in a style similar to that affected by Eretria. In Chalcis have been found some Attic vases, now in Athens. Other black figure vases in Chalcis Museum 309 seem neither Attic, Boeotian nor Eretrian, and certainly not ' Chalcidian'. Further excavation in Eretria may help to make clear other distinguishing features of Eretrian work, but a fuller examination of the black figure from other sites outside Athens and Attica is also necessary before any convincing identification of non-Athenian vase painting centres can be made. Finds in Boeotia have revealed a few groups which illustrate local fashions in sixth-century painting. The less like Attic these vases are, the more easily are they identified, and in Boeotia there is the added help afforded by the known non-Attic vase shapes, the kantharos, etc., which are found in large numbers. But in Boeotia, as in the rest of Greece and in all periods, vases were being made in many places and almost invariably receiving painted decoration in the potter's workshop. Local traditions often dictated the style of this decoration, sometimes so strongly that the ware can be easily distinguished from the Athenian pottery which reached almost every known site. Thus it is with many Boeotian wares. Sometimes it is only in some details and shapes, as in Eretria, that the local ware can be identified. Often the work must have followed Athenian models so slavishly that it can scarcely be distinguished and indeed need hardly be distinguished from vases made in Athens or Attica. The work of these smaller centres, both in and outside Attica, was probably hardly ever exported but kept for the local market, and may sometimes naturally be found on neigh- bouring sites. Lekythoi offer a good test case. They are regular grave furniture in the sixth century, and as cemeteries have been so much plundered by excavators and others the finds have been peculiarly rich. Lekythoi have been found in very great numbers in Eretria. The better vases are in Athens,310 or have found their way into European and American collections, but scores of poorly decorated lekythoi lie in Eretria Museum and the Eretria Apotheke of the National Museum. I have not studied these vases, as most of them are later than the proposed limits 309 I know these vases only from photographs. Haspels, in ABL, mentions four as Attic, Museum Inv. 562, 563, 567, 569. Kraiker speaks of one as Chalcidian (Gnomon I934,244, n. 2), which Amyx (AJA I94I, 64, n. 4) assumes to be Inv. 569. There is, however, another lekythos in Chalcis bearing on the shoulder unlinked buds (alternate ones showing white sepals) and on the body an ill-drawn panther, which may be the one referred to by Kraiker. There is also an unusual jug with red and black zig-zag decoration in the body zone. On other finds from Chalcis see above n. 73. 310 Of the inventoried lekythoi in the National Museum at Athens 255 are from Eretria.</page><page sequence="47">POTTERY FROM ERETRIA 47 in time of this study. It would also be necessary to trace all other lekythoi from Eretria which are no longer in Greece. I feel sure that they cannot all be imports from Athens or Attica. On some lekythoi from the well-published Boeotian graves at Rhitsona the motif is found of white sepals in lotuses, sometimes in unlinked chains,811 and again on lekythoi from Delos 312 and Chalcis.313 I quote examples of this motif in particular for its appearance on Eretrian vases, and because I believe it may be non-Athenian. Other motifs could doubtless be found, and though the identification from them of vase painting centres producing inferior Atticising work might seem a thankless task, it might yet lead to the attribution of some of the many better painted not-quite-Attic vases which can claim no known workshop or hand. It should be possible in time to speak of Athenian or Eleusinian vase painting rather than Attic, and of Theban or Tanagran or Thespian rather than the all-embracing 'Boeotian' which has long and uneasily served such a variety of geometric, archaic and black figure vase groups.314 In the fifth century very many of the known white-ground lekythoi are from Eretria. Gardner 315 once suggested that many of them are of Eretrian origin, and serious attempts have been made since to prove that some of the leading white-ground vase painters of the fifth century worked in Eretria.316 An Eretrian or Euboean origin for later fifth century work found in Boeotia has also been suggested.317 We know that Athens was not the only city in which vases painted in the black figure or red figure styles were made. Evidence has been offered for a local school in Eretria in the sixth century as in the seventh; that one still existed there in the fifth century seems not unlikely, and the eventual publication of pottery which has been excavated on other sites in Greece may reveal vase painting centres which had a record as long as Eretria, and perhaps at times more distinguished. GENERAL SUMMARY The earliest excavated pottery from Eretria is of the eighth century. Two sherds decorated in a Protogeometric style are probably not earlier than 800 B.C. (FIG. 13b; PLATE I A, 18). The eighth century geometric pottery is decorated in a style which owes much to both Athens and the Cyclades. That the vases were made locally is suggested by the uniformity of the fabric of fragments bearing, some Atticising, some Cycladic-type decoration, and some slipped, others unslipped surfaces. A group of late geometric skyphoi and mugs (PLATE I B, IO-0-27) seem peculiar to Eretria, and from the seventh century a group of dinoi (FIG. 9; PLATE 2 B, 14-18). Elaborately incised pithoi were made about 700 B.C., and used eventually for child burials (FIG. I6c-h). At about this time too begins the series of Eretrian footed grave amphorae with high necks, used for the same purpose, whose development can be traced from their subgeometric beginnings to after 550 B.C., when vases of a similar shape were decorated in an Atticising black figure style. The earliest groups of these amphorae (Groups A and B) bear subgeometric decoration, occasionally figured (PLATES 3, 4). The style is 311 Ure, Sixth and Fifth Cent.

If, after the sack of Eretria and deportation of its people by the Persians (Herodotus VI o I) the city was soon resettled from Attica, as the finds of pottery in Eretria seem to suggest, and if, say, an Athens-trained Achilles Painter and others worked regularly for potters in Eretria, and probably export their work also, is their painting then Athenian or Eretrian? 317 Ure, Classification de Cdramique I7, BSA XLI 27 f.</page><page sequence="48">48 POTTERY FROM ERETRIA close to some Boeotian and Cycladic work, but quite distinctive. In the last quarter of the seventh century outline figure drawing appears, and eventually the use of incision, on gaudily colourful grave amphorae (Group C), bearing groups of women, and animals, still in a dis- tinctive and Eretrian style which oweS more to the Cyclades than to Attica (PLATES 5, 6). One bears an inscription GEA (C2: PLATE 5) which can hardly apply to the women who are probably mourners (p. 26). The backs of these vases, as of the later Group D amphorae, are covered with characteristic coarse interlace ornament (FIG. 20). From the first quarter of the sixth century are grave amphorae (Group D: PLATE 8) bearing pairs of animals grouped heraldically. The Cycladic outline style is retained for some animals' heads, but incision is used very freely now, and but for one early example (DI : PLATE 8) the painting is extremely gross and careless. A variety is an amphora painted in a simple silhouette style (Dio: PLATE 8). Of about 550 B.c. and soon after are three large grave amphorae (PLATES 9--I I), painted in a competent black figure style at first sight quite Athenian. These vases represent the end of the series which began over a century and a half earlier with the subgeometric amphorae Groups A and B. The vases retain the high necks and feet of the seventh century, but show details in shape and choice of figured decoration which are paralleled in the Attic lebes gamikos shape. The figure drawing is competently Atticising and often most successful (PLATE II), but details betray the provincial hand and offer evidence for a local school of black figure. Other black figure pottery from Eretria includes a belly amphora of the end of the first half of the sixth century in an extraordinary provincial style (PLATE 12), and other vases (notably nos. 1-5 above, pp. 40-41), from which further information about the local Eretrian style in the sixth century can be gained. From these some tentative attributions of vases from nearby Boeotia and Delos can be made (PLATE I4), which, if not Eretrian, must be from some closely allied vase painting centre.
