<plain_text><page sequence="1">?n 1867 Captain Charles Warren, the great nineteenth-century excavator of Jerusalem, traveled east of the Jordan River and camped at a place he called "eU'Ameireh" (Merling 1989). In his report, he described the site as "three tells' (Warren 1870). Indeed, he camped at the location probably because there was water in the spring at the foot of the western tell. Although he spelled the name "el-Ameireh," it was undoubtedly the same site we are now excavating, Tall aU'Umayri, using the new official Jordanian spellings of place names. Remarkably, since Warrens time, there is no clear indication that the site was ever visited again by archaeologists until it was rediscovered over one hundred years later by the Hisban regional survey team in 1976 (Ibach 1987: 31). No road traversed the immediate region until the construction of the modern airport highway in 1983. Moreover, because the site is not strategically placed at a high location, the rolling hills of the area hid it from explorers. Even Nelson Glueck, that intrepid archaeological explorer ofjorfan in the 1930s and 1940s, missed the site as he traveled the Madaba road farther to the east, passing by Jawa and Yaduda.

In 1978, on the basis of Ibach's recommendation, Larry Geraty, John Lawlor, and I (Herr) attempted to find the site, fighting with winding camel tracks and the eager ignorance of wandering locals from whom we constantly sought directions. After many false starts in several different directions, we finally arrived, probably the first archaeologists to visit the site since the Hisban survey team in 1976. As Ibach had reported, all the pottery we could find on the surface?and there was a thick carpet of broken potsherds everywhere?dated to the Bronze and Iron Ages. Further, there were generous signs of stone walls on the top and slopes of the hill. It was a perfect site for us to dig following our six seasons at Tall Hisban, where the finds mostly dated to the classical and Islamic ages. If we would dig at 'Umayri, we could study all the historical archaeological periods on the central Jordanian plateau. That is the reason renewed excavations by Andrews University began in 1984 at 'Umayri, reborn as the Madaba Plains Project (MPP). The Bronze and Iron Age site of Tall al-'Umayri ('Umayri West) is a small, but densely occupied, multi-period site located on a natural ridge twelve kilometers south of Amman's Seventh Circle. It lies on the western side of the airport highway next to Amman National Park.1 Until recently, a spring at the northern foot of the site was the only natural water source between Ras al-'Ayn (downtown Amman) and Madaba. It was undoubtedly the reason for settlement at the location. Longtime resident and historian Raouf Abujaber, who grew up in the area, has told us that he remembers finding water there when he was young in the 1930s. However, the source is now dry and has been covered and forgotten by recent development in the area. Excavations at the water source in Field E discovered ancient water facilities, such as drains, channels, and walls dating to the Iron II, the Roman, and Byzantine periods. The structures from the last period included a nicely constructed well house made of ashlar stones. It seems to have functioned into the early-twentieth century (Fisher 1997: 176-87) when Abujaber found water coming from the source. The ancient spring (or well) was probably also instrumental in the establishment of three other minor sites located on hills nearby?those that Warren had observed in the nineteenth century: (1) shallow remains from the classical period are on a hill to the east ('Umayri East) and include terrace walls, large and small rural structures, tombs, and caves; a recent discovery by illicit diggers has the appearance of a well-constructed, vaulted crypto NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 69</page><page sequence="3">Stratum Period Neolithic Dates ca. 9000-4500 B.c.E.

The finds from the dolmen included a semi-articulated leg, beads, and a cup, shown here in situ. portico made of ashlar stones (very well-hewn building stones) ; (2) structures and caves from the Mamluk and Ottoman periods ('Umayri North) covered a hill to the northeast; in the 1980s some of the older modern residents remembered living in these caves; and (3) the modern village of Bunayat to the north-northeast settled by Ajarmeh Bedouin during the twentieth century. The immediate area of the site was thus occupied almost continuously from the Neolithic period (below) to the present. The primary site?dating to the Bronze and Iron Ages?nearest the water is the one we have been digging. It can lay no claims whatsoever to a naturally strategic setting. That is, it dominates no significant landscape and guards no prominently visible approach to the area. Indeed, the top of the site is lower than the immediately surrounding hills to the north, west, and south. To the east, one can see only as far as Tall Jawa, about five kilometers distant. Watch towers would have been necessary on the surrounding hills to provide any kind of early warning system about advancing enemy forces. Our regional survey found structures that could have been several of those towers. Rather, the site's "strategic" value was command of the water source. It also guarded the approach to the Ammonite hills from the Madaba Plain if the ancient road passed the site (and it probably did because the water was there). Using an itinerary of Thutmose III, some researchers tentatively identified the site with Abel-Keramim of Judg 11:33 (Redford 1982), but there is no certainty. Redford traced Thutmose's journey from Amman to the south toward Madaba, designating 'Umayri as one of the major stops along the route because of the water source. Indeed, although the main highway to Madaba is farther to the east today and even if 'Umayri is not Abel-Keramim, there is good evidence that the ancient "Kings' Highway" followed the water and went past 'Umayri on its way south. Large-scale excavations began at the site in 1984 under the auspices of the Madaba Plains Project sponsored by Andrews University in cooperation with the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman. Raouf Abujaber, a major landowner of the site and a historian of Jordan, also welcomed us. The team has excavated for twelve seasons (1984, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008), though the dig is now sponsored by La Sierra University in consortium with Andrews University School of Architecture, Canadian University College, Mount Royal College, Pacific Union College, and Walla Walla University (other institutions that belonged to the consortium for periods of time were Wilfrid Laurier University [1987, 1989], Atlantic Union College [1987, 1989, 1992], and Levant Foundation Poland [1994]).2 The excavations show that the site was occupied by twenty-one separate settlements (strata) stretching from Early Bronze Age I to the Islamic era, but the primary periods of occupation were the NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 71</page><page sequence="5">Bronze and Iron Ages. The best-preserved remains come from the Late Bronze Age and the LB/Iron I transitional period. Unstratified Stone Age Periods Neolithic flint tools were found in 1978 by a survey of the Yaduda area led by H. J. Franken of the University of Leiden and R. Abujaber. They were located on the lower western and eastern slopes of the site (Franken and Abujaber 1989: 408). These unillustrated finds indicate only that some sort of activity took place in the area and not necessarily that people lived there at that time. The remains were in mixed deposits and no in situ or secondary finds from the Neolithic period have been discovered by our excavations. Franken claims that his survey at the eastern foot of the site, currently under the modern airport highway, found Chalcolithic remains (Franken and Abujaber 1989: 415). The site is no longer available for excavation. However, much of the pottery illustrated by Franken (Franken and Abujaber 1989: 421) seems to me (Herr) to date to the Early Bronze period (mostly EB I) and some forms are even Iron Age (see especially sherd no. 30, which seems to be an Iron II krater). The Bronze Age Stratum 21 (Early Bronze Age IB) At the southeastern foot of the hill in Field were the huge megaliths of a dolmen without its capstone. Our tomb team, headed by Elzbieta Dubis of Krakov, Poland, had come across what appeared to be an entrance to a rock-cut cave tomb, but excavation promptly uncovered disarticulated human bones of what would turn out to be twenty secondary burials (based on the number of skulls) inside the megalithic walls of a dolmen. The disarticulated bones suggest that the individuals were buried elsewhere initially, then dug up and transferred to the dolmen site for secondary reburial. The bones were accompanied by beads, Canaanean flint tools, mace heads, and eighteen whole pottery vessels from the EB IB period, a few with typical band painting (Dubis and Dabrowski 2002). There were no artifacts from any other period inside the dolmen. This is the first time such finds and such clear evidence for date, function, and use patterns have been discovered inside a dolmen anywhere in the Mediterranean basin. Immediately surrounding the dolmen and piled against its eastern, southern, and western sides were smaller stones (small boulders), suggesting the original structure may have been covered by stones looking something like a large cairn. But perhaps even more striking than the preservation of the finds was the presence of a series of beaten-earth, plaster, and pebbled surfaces surrounding the dolmen (partially visible in the photo at the top of p. 71). In places where the slope was steep, the surfaces included bedrock steps, especially in front of Other finds from the dolmen included pottery dating to the EB IB period, beads, Canaanean flint tools, and mace heads. Wall fragments west of the dolmen that may be the remains of a shelter for visitors are visible at the top of this photo. The large stone near the bottom left (the associated surface has been excavated in this photo) may have been a table, platform, or altar. The visitors may have come to the dolmen to conduct feasts and other mortuary or funerary rituals. 72 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="6">the structure (see Dubis and Dabrowski [2002] for illustrations). Close to the dolmen, as many as five surfaces were discovered, one on top of the other. But the numbers of surfaces diminished as excavations moved away from the structure. Embedded into the surfaces at a distance of about three to four meters were a ceramic jar (north) and a stone table or platform or altar (west). The latter was placed in front of the only structural walls near the dolmen.

The dolmen still stands on the lower southern slopes of the site about one hundred meters north of the modern petrol station. Strata 20-19 (Early Bronze Age II-III) Although EB IB layers may ultimately be found at the top of the site, our first certain signs of habitation on the tell start with EB II on the southern slope of the site in Field D. The configuration of the landscape that the first settlers found was essentially that of a ridge projecting eastward from the higher ridge (now the forested Amman National Park) to the west. Levels of exposed bedrock on the west show that the site was not an isolated ~Wj I hill, but contained defensible slopes only on its north, east, and south sides. ^^^^^^^ Four phases of pre*EB IV wall fragments from ^^^B ' domestic dwellings were built on the northern and southern slopes of the site (Fields C and D), but the changes were so slight we have combined them ^^^^ ^ ^ into two strata.

The last and best preserved phase, shown in this plan of Field D, was covered by debris from collapsed walls and ceilings, including plastered reeds and burned beams. The finds comprised parts of three houses separated by narrow alleyways and a terrace wall. This partially cobbled courtyard belongs to the best preserved EB III house in Field D. In the foreground is the "kitchen" of the house, complete with a "range," that is, a stone-lined fire pit. These pottery vessels are shown in their original locations on the floor of the storeroom of the Early Bronze Age house. One of the large jars contained over one thousand chick peas, enough to furnish the family with plenty of hummus! NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 73</page><page sequence="7">A poorly preserved EB IV house in Stratum 18 of Field D was built directly over the much better preserved EB III houses of Stratum 19. The most complete house (to the east of the street) had a cobbled courtyard for animals in the northwest, a living area in the northeast, a kitchen with a sunken hearth in a stone bench in the southwest, and a storeroom with thirty broken but complete pottery vessels in the southeast (Harrison 1997a: 114-15). One of the jars contained the charred remains of over one thousand chick peas. Hummus seems to be at least five thousand years old! Though incompletely excavated, parts of two other houses, each with at least two rooms, were discovered across a narrow street to the west and on an upper terrace to the north. They, too, produced parts of smashed store jars and long, thin flint blades in the Canaanean style. The western house contained two interconnected subterranean storage chambers carved into the bedrock. A series of steps accessed these basement rooms. Other terraces probably supported houses on the upper slopes of the site. TELL EL-'UMEIRI SECTION OF WESTERN DEFENSE SYSTEM-FIELD Square 7K80 7J89 7J88 7J87 7J86 7J85 7J84 At some point in Stratum 15 (MB IIC), the inhabitants fortified the site. These fortifications transformed its appearance, creating the modern hill-like shape we see today. In this section through the fortification system the white features date to the Middle Bronze HC and the light gray ones to the LB/lron I transitional period. 74 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="8">The three small soundings that made up Field G on the northern slope of the site all produced Early Bronze III domestic remains with smashed pottery. Although our soundings in Fields C and G were too small to allow us to judge confidently, there was probably a similar series of terraces with domestic buildings here. The top of the ridge was probably occupied at this time, too, though in situ Early Bronze remains have not yet been discovered there, except for small bedrock features under the Stratum 17 (MB) rampart in Field B. Although the site was 4.7 hectares in size (11.7 acres),3 no signs of a fortification system have been found, at least on the lower slopes. Likewise, excavation to bedrock on the western lip of the site in Field B, where we would expect fortifications, has yielded no sign of an Early Bronze fortification system for the upper tell. We must understand the settlement as essentially a large village (Harrison 1997b; Philip 2008). Strata 18-17 (Early Bronze Age IV) Directly above the well preserved houses of EB III in Field D were two considerably more ephemeral strata (Mitchel 1989: 287-95). The earliest stratum (18) comprised the partial remains of two small, nearly square structures of one room, each sporting one pillar in the center, probably to support a crude roof. The walls were very narrow and could not have been very high. Thin surfaces with no accumulation on them suggest the buildings did not have a lengthy lifespan. The western house had curved corners, while excavation has produced only one angled corner for the eastern house. Although interior surfaces contained grinding tools and mortars, only an outside exposure surface (a surface that was not used intensively by human traffic) connected the six meters of space between the two dwellings, implying that occupation at the site was sparse. The structures seem to date to the earliest stages of EB IV (based on pottery) when the EB III civilization was collapsing throughout the southern Levant. Above the two houses and also dated to EB IV, was an even more ephemeral series of small stone walls, possibly used for animal pens or to define fields or gardens (Stratum 17). Much of the second half of the EB IV period seems to have seen no settlement at 'Umayri, but a cemetery of shaft tombs just east of the airport highway produced typical EB IV tomb furnishings (Waheeb and Palumbo 1993). Strata 16-15 (Middle Bronze Age IIC) After a hiatus during the early stages of the Middle Bronze Age, a major settlement was again established. The initial one (Stratum 16) was built on the ridge top and soon grew larger so that houses were constructed on the northern slope in Field C. So far, in situ remains have been found only in this location. Until now, very little could be said about the identity of the people who settled our site. Only rarely do settlers tell us who they were through inscriptions or other identifying features. Based on evidence from many sites and finds in the southern Levant dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, these newcomers may have been what the Bible and other texts refer to as "Canaanites." Much more prominent was Stratum 15. At some point the inhabitants fortified the site by creating a hill out of the original ridge. In Field B, where the site joined the higher ridge to the west, they dug a north-to-south dry moat five meters deep across the ridge at the western edge of the settlement and then piled up layers of earth and crushed limestone to create a steep rampart climbing up another five meters for a total of ten meters from the bottom of the moat to the top of the rampart. The earth within the rampart contained MB IIC pottery from A cave tomb, with multiple burials and several MB IIC pottery vessels, shown here, was found near the dolmen on the lower southeastern slope of 'Umayri. Wall fragments of the MB IIC period are visible at the bottom of this photo. The very large boulders almost qualify as "Cyclopean" masonry, a typical feature of Middle Bronze Age architecture. A lime coated surface runs up to the wall stones. NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 75</page><page sequence="9">A moldmade "Asherah" figurine was found in debris from the LB II town in Field F. The nude woman with a "page-boy" hairstyle is typical of small female figurines from this period. the Stratum 16 settlement. There does not seem to have been a wall at the top of the rampart at the location of our section. A small portion of the same rampart seems to have been discovered at the top of the northern slope just outside the Stratum 14 (Late Bronze Age) palace/temple. These fortifications transformed the appearance of the site, creating the modern hill-like shape we see today. Nestled inside the newly fortified settlement (looking much like a crater) was the contemporary town. Our project has so far discovered two locations in Field where fragmentary MB IIC walls were found. One was made up of two wall fragments constructed of relatively large boulders (a typical feature of many Middle Bronze sites) and was undoubtedly part of a major building, while the other had three walls supporting a plastered pool, one of the earliest constructed water installations inside a site so far discovered in Jordan. The latter construction was situated on top of the rampart. Both sets of walls may have belonged to a large tower or palatial building at the northwest corner of the site, probably the highest spot at the time. Extra-urban domestic remains were discovered on the northern slope of the site in Field C (a surface and a fragmentary wall) above the Stratum 16 remains (Battenfield 1991: 75). The pottery associated with all these features was typical of MB IIC assemblages and included "chocolate-on-white" ware, which also continued into LB I. A cave tomb, with multiple burials and several MB IIC pottery vessels, was found near the dolmen at the southeastern base of the site in Field (G?rniak and Kapica 2002). This tomb is still visible. Stratum 14 (Late Bronze Age II) Although the rare potsherd is found now and then from the first half of the Late Bronze Age, we have not yet discovered any certain architectural features from this time period. We thus tentatively suggest a hiatus. Stratum 14 reflects 'Umayri's settlement during the Late Bronze Age II, so far excavated only in Field F, the eastern portion of the tell, and Field in the northwestern corner of the site. Thus, the extant evidence demonstrates a Late Bronze occupation at 'Umayri that may have made use of the entire 1.4 hectare area of the top of the site, probably that area encompassed by the MB IIC rampart. Field F produced a series of four arbitrarily defined LB II debris layers overlying a Middle Bronze Age structure that was exposed in only one square (6M90) and consisted of remains of a few walls and earth layers, possibly a terrace wall (Low 1997: 191-95).

At the bottom of the photo is a monumental entrance with a series of stairs leading down to the entrance room and another series leading up to what must have been the second floor.

The other source of information from the Late Bronze Age on the site comprises a very well-preserved monumental building in Field B, atop the relatively well defined MB IIC remains of Stratum 15. Because it is an important structure for the archaeology of Jordan, and because it has not been published before, we will describe it in some detail. Built directly into and over the interior portions of the Middle Bronze rampart in the northwest corner of the site, this building emerged over six excavation seasons. Because the walls stood over two meters high in places, it took our team parts of three seasons to excavate any given room to the floor. The site's inhabitants utilized not only the Middle Bronze rampart layers sloping toward the center of the city on which to found the building, but also the two-meter thick walls of a Middle Bronze tower built at the northwest corner of the site. The building consisted of five rooms with two floors. Both phases utilized the same architectural elements of the building, albeit with slight variations. A plan of the building reveals the rooms?two on the southern side (Rooms 1 and 2), an entry hall (Room 4), a large central room (Room 3), and a back room along the western side of the building (Room 5). The exterior dimensions of the building are clear. It is basically rectangular in shape with exterior measurements of 12 by 16 meters. The walls are bonded throughout, except those abutting the northern and western exterior walls, and consist predominantly of semi-hewn small to medium-sized boulders, making the construction of the walls unique for the site. The interior wall between Rooms 3 and 5 was of mixed construction, made up of both small boulders and mudbricks. Exterior walls measured 1.5 meters in thickness, with the exception of the western wall of Room 5, which consisted of the two-meter-thick external "tower" wall of Stratum 15, and those on the interior between 1 and 1.2 meters thick. One curious feature is the two parallel walls forming the eastern side of the building, set cheek-by-jowl next to each other. Only during the last season did the obvious explanation appear to us: the inner (western) of the two walls is actually a "stair wall." That is, the stairs preserved farther to the north would have continued This computerized isometric drawing shows the layout of the Late Bronze building, which includes two southern rooms (1 and 2), an entry hall (4), a large central room (3), and a back room (5) along the western side of the building.

NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 77</page><page sequence="11">In Room 3 of the Late Bronze Age building the inhabitants had constructed a plastered niche, seen here as it was discovered in 2004. Within it were five natural standing stones embedded in plaster together with a variety of ceramic objects. On the floor in front of the niche were a presentation altar (seen here) and small offering table. Hundreds of smashed domestic animal bones (mostly sheep and goat) covered the floor of the room. Their preservation does not suggest that they had been burned. Rooms 3 and 5 appears only to have been built to its surviving height of just over one meter. It seems clear from the destruction debris in all five rooms that the structure once supported a second story over at least portions of it. Massive amounts of mudbricks from the upper walls and mud from the ceilings, second story flooring, and roofing detritus filled every room, with burned remains of large support beams especially concentrated in Room 3. Added to this evidence for another floor to the building is the stairway on the eastern side of Room 4 leading upward. Indeed, the stairway seems to have continued for a considerable distance on top of the eastern wall of Room 1. There has been some debate about whether Room 3 might have supported a second story, given the wide span between load-bearing walls. Unfortunately, the surviving evidence is of limited value in this regard, but, as the painting on p. 77 makes clear, we tend to think it was a single story, perhaps with a higher ceiling. One entered the building from the east through a stepped threshold 1.5 meters wide, lined in upwards on top of this wall to the second floor or the roof. Thus the eastern wall, made of larger stones, is actually the outer wall of the structure. While for the most part these walls were preserved over two meters high in places, the mixed-construction wall between places with orthostatic stones (flat stones placed on edge). One went up a few steps and then down again to a small paved platform located roughly in the center of the stairway wall of Room 4. At this juncture, those entering could choose to turn left, ascending the stone stairs, we assume, to the second story. 78 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="12">On the other hand, the platform also connected to stairs leading down to the right into Room 4. A third option presented itself with at least two steps leading directly down into this room. Room 4 measured nearly eight meters long and over two meters wide. Doorways were built into three of this room's walls?the 1.5 meter-wide entry on the east, a 1.2 meter wide door into Room 1 on the south, and two 1.2 meter-wide doors in the western wall, providing access to Room 3. The southern of the two doors was used throughout the building's occupation, but the northern one fell out of use during the second phase, and the owners filled it in with stones. Given the construction of the entryway and span between the walls, it does not seem likely that there was a second story above Room 4. On the floor of the room lay hundreds of bones and two large, flat stones that may have been standing stones used in ritual activities. This, along with broken ascending stairs in the room and the separation of rows in the eastern exterior wall, testifies to an earthquake as the cause of the building's destruction, though this quake may have occurred at the end of Stratum 13 (below). Rooms 1 and 2 were entered through the southern doorway of Room 4. Occupying about one third of the floor space of the building, their combined thirty-one-square-meter floor area revealed multiple lenses of use surfaces. The walls were all bonded and preserved to more than two meters high. The western wall of Room 2 seems to have used an earlier MB IIC mudbrick wall. Otherwise, besides the evidence of a fiery end for the burned bricks, there was nothing found on the floors in the room to suggest a function. The size of the room, the massive amount of fallen bricky debris (accumulating over two meters thick), and the stairway in Room 4 are persuasive evidence of a second story at least above Rooms 2 and 3. Room 3, accessed through the doorway (s) in the wall between Rooms 4 and 3, yielded the most exciting discoveries in the building. These finds also contribute to our understanding of the building's function. Encompassing twenty-eight square meters of floor space, its walls were mostly of stone, with extensive evidence of mud plaster covering the stones. But the western, "installation wall" (Bramlett 2008) consisted of mudbrick as well as stone, and originally likely stood only one meter or so high. Toward the southern end of this wall the ancients had installed, approximately 0.6 meters above the floor, a plastered niche measuring 1.6 meters wide, 0.6 meters high and 0.4 meters deep. It housed five natural standing stones embedded in plaster together with several ceramic artifacts including two carinated bowls, a chalice, parts of four lamps, and two crudely made, unfired figurines. The five stones embedded in the plaster of the niche included a large central aniconic stone in a dome like shape, flanked on the left by a small, disc-shaped stone and one that looked like a human foot. On the right were a head-shaped stone and then a smaller chert nodule which, with its natural calcareous accretions, gave the appearance of a face with an open eye. Placed on the floor in front of the niche were a flanged presentation altar and small offering table, both made This crudely made, unfired clay figurine is one of fifteen found in Room 5 of the Late Bronze building.

Along the eastern wall, what were probably bench stones were also discovered in Room 3. The floor of almost the complete room was covered with hundreds of bones from domestic animals. The bones showed no signs of burning. Behind the "cultic wall" of Room 3 was another space, Room 5. Bounded by the Middle Bronze "tower wall" on the west, a short wall on the south, a segment of the northern wall, and the "cultic wall" on the east, it was rectangular in shape, measuring 4.3 meters long and 2.1 meters across. Its floor level was more than one meter above that of Room 3, likely due to the rising Middle Bronze rampart beneath. There appears to be no point of entry into the space. The room produced fifteen handmade, poorly fired ceramic figurines and three nearly complete ceramic vessels?a goblet, a dipper juglet, and one small jar. NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 79</page><page sequence="13">IT'S A TEMPLE WITH SIDE ROOMS A notable feature of the Late Bronze building is the cult niche with five standing stones and the plastered mudbrick presentation altar in Room 3. However, a cult niche does not a temple make. Here I will briefly explain why I interpret this building to have functioned primarily as a temple. Room layout and organization suggests Room 3 was the dominant and most significant room of this building. The entry steps and ascending staircase across Room 4 diminished utilitarian space, and what remained directed access past a mudbrick and-pfoster altar with associated standing stone through two doorways (a third was later blocked up) to the other rooms. A second story existed over Rooms 1 and 2 but the archaeological evidence does not easily accord a second story over Rooms 3 and 4. Not a single comparabh residential or pafotial structure in Syria-Palestine (of which I am aware) exhibits a cult room at the functional center of its floor plan, or anywhere else for that matter, and the plan does not align easily with Late Bronze Age houses, though the MB/LB "Syrian house type" (Ho?aday 1997) shows certain limited parallels. In comparison to these, our building dedicated a larger proportion of its space to the entry room (Room 4); the smaller adjunct rooms (Rooms 1 and 2) do not communicate directly to the main hall (Room 3) and only sequentially to the long entry hall (Room 4). Most significantly, and, for me, persuasively, room-use analysis of Building C shows that the entire building was oriented toward cultic function. Daviau (1993) provides statistical benchmarks for vessel percentages per type associated with functional class paradigms for area use and room function. In the use-surface strata of all the rooms, vessels associated with food consumption, particularly the numbers of bowls and platters (shallow bowk), predominated: Room 1, bowk and peters 15, cooking pots 5, jars and jugs 2, L?mps 1; Room 2, bowls and platters 7, cooking pots 3, jars and jugs 3; Room 3, bowk and platters 30, cooking pots 0, jars and jugs 6, lamp 1; Room 4, bowls and platters 42, cooking pots 15, jars and jugs 6, L?mps 6. In Room 3 we found nearly complete shallow bowh with sheep or goat bones in them near the stone bench opposite the cultic niche and altar and along the north wall of the room. The high proportion of bowh to food storage containers far exceeds the number usually found in domestic contexts but is consonant with the practice of shared sacral meals or food offerings presented in cultic ritual. Additionally, we found no ovens, bins, silos, or obvious food preparation areas anywhere in the building. But we did find unfired clay figurines similar to those placed in the cultic niche in Rooms 2, 3, 4, and 5. The pL?stered mudbrick table and standing stone near the foot of the stairs and three cultic miniature bowls found in Room 4 also indicate pervasive cultic attention throughout the major rooms of this building. While 1 conclude from the available evidence that the observance of cult was the most important function of this building, I do allow for a unique synthesis of typology such that the building may have served as a complete institution for the cult practitioners in which priestly dwelling and divine house were not clearly distinguished. Nevertheless, "temple" is the best designator for this building. Kent Bramlett Given the combined floor space of Rooms 3 and 5, it is highly unlikely that a second story existed over them. If, as we have proposed, the wall between the two rooms was less than two meters high and thus not load bearing, the span would be too great to support another construction level. But there were at least two phases of use, the second marked by the blockage of the northern doorway in the eastern wall of Room 3 and a use surface approximately ten to twelve centimeters above the original level. The architectural and artifactual evidence seems to suggest a palatial and certainly a cultic function. The size and construction of walls and the floor plan rule out a primarily domestic function. Was the main purpose of the structure religious or political, if the two can be separated completely? Rooms 1 and 2 have given up little evidence to help us make this distinction. Room 4 was clearly an entry hall, which might fit either palace or temple architecture, but the two "standing stones" definitely suggest a religious aspect to the room. But how should we interpret Rooms 3 and 5? Do they represent the cultic component of a palatial facility or do they reflect the central purpose of the structure as a temple with an entry hall and two large side chambers? Kent Bramlett's University of Toronto Ph.D. dissertation (2008) on the building in its archaeological and historical context argues cautiously but strongly for identifying this structure as a temple and cites comparative evidence from the Levant, especially from Israel/Palestine and Jordan. The cultic function of Room 3, central to the building's spatial features, along with the function of Room 5 as a probable vestry or favissa for storing unused (or no longer usable) cultic artifacts, certainly gives pride of place to this interpretation. Bramlett also treats contemporary Late Bronze Age settlements in the region, reconstructing in the process proposed 80 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="14">IT'S A PALACE WITH A SHRINE / would dearly like this building to be a temple too, but 1 cant find any similar temples with four interconnecting rooms anywhere in the eastern Meditenanean. The Late Bronze Age was a time when the elite members of society seem to have been very prominent at settlement sites, constructing palaces and temples at almost every town or city site where excavators dig. So it was no surprise to us to find this splendid building. But the shrine was a surprise, because the plan of the building did not lead us to expect such a find. Most temples in the Late Bronze Age are made up of two rooms, sometimes with small attached storerooms or favissas. They do not have large attached rooms like our southern rooms. And those rooms soar two stories high, well above the top of the "holy" room. What god would like that?! To suggest that the priests may have lived higher than the god in the same building is not normally acceptable. The lack of parallels and the small nature of the shrine itself lead me to think of the building as a pafotial structure for a well-to-do family who also wanted significant cultic space attached, probably for a minor deity or group of deities. / say this not only because the shrine was low in elevation relative to the other rooms of the building, but the "cultic" vessels found in the niche were slightly broken, even though they were in situ and had not fallen. The breaks were ancient and no mendable pieces at all were found. There was no rim on the chalice at all; it had broken away in many pieces in antiquity and was placed in the shrine in a defective state. The bowls and lamps were similar. Even the figurines were so crude that we cannot suggest they were intended to inspire honor and respect for a major deity. It doesnt seem like the people treated the shrine with much respect. I will admit that my interpretation (first made in 2004 when the shrine was found) is weakened a bit by the standing stones found in the entrance room in 2008, but two "cultic" rooms out of a total of six rooms (counting two rooms on the second floor above the two southern rooms) does not make a tempk in my view. Let the debate continuel Larry G. Herr lines of commerce and communication as well as political ties (2008: 55-113). From the archaeological evidence, he posits a string of sites scattered along highland trade routes which served an important role in Late Bronze commerce in Transjordan. The small cluster of sites in central Jordan, including Sahab, Amman, Umm ad-Dananir, Safut, and 'Umayri, were close enough in proximity to each other to have formed a city-state form of polity. As part of this city-state system, 'Umayri and its fortunes diminished toward the beginning of the thirteenth century at about the time of increasing Egyptian influence in the region, influence that favored Amman and Sahab (Bramlett 2008: 269-70). The Iron Age Stratum 13 (Late Bronze Age/Early Iron I Transition) Following the collapse of the LB II temple and its associated settlement, there was a fundamental change in the nature of the settlement. Gone are palatial buildings associated with activities of the elite classes of society; gone are fertility figurines of Asherah and cultic shrines; and gone are pottery forms solidly at home in the Late Bronze Age. Newly arrived are houses and finds very similar to the earliest stages of the Iron I settlement sites west of the Jordan River; pottery forms that anticipate those found at the scores of Iron I settlement sites throughout the southern Levant; and modest religious expressions in the form of crude standing stones and ceramic model shrines. One can compare the finds best with the settlement of diverse tribal groups, probably a very similar settlement pattern as that noted for highland sites west of the Jordan River (Faust 2006). The inhabitants of 'Umayri built their settlement, but before they could live there very long an earthquake seriously jolted the settlement around 1200 B.C.E. We have very few architectural remains from this stratum, but we know their cultural remains from the debris taken from their structures for subsequent reuse in the reconstruction of the severely damaged western defensive rampart system, which, until the earthquake, was still in use from its initial founding in Stratum 15 (MBA). Thus, at this point in the excavation of'Umayri, we can speak only of some kind of occupation (Stratum 13) whose earthquake damage provided the raw materials for rebuilding parts of 'Umayri in the subsequent, spectacularly preserved Stratum 12. It may have been this earthquake that damaged the walls of Stratum 14 (above). We found no signs of occupation above the Late Bronze Age building in either Stratum 13 or 12, even though it was out of use since the end of Stratum 14. The pottery from Stratum 13 is virtually like that of the following one, except there were fewer Iron I forms and more Late Bronze ones, which suggests the tail end of the Late Bronze Age. NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 81</page><page sequence="15">Stratum 12 (Late Bronze Age/Early Iron I Transition) The post-earthquake settlement at 'Umayri rebounded immediately following the seismic event that destroyed the Stratum 15 (MBA) western defenses, as indicated by the quick repairs to the disrupted rampart layers. During this period the town likely encompassed the entire top of the tell in addition to small areas on the slopes. Remains from the LB/Iron I transition have been excavated in all fields on the flat top as well as downslope in Field (the western defense system), Field C on the northern slope, and Field F on the eastern part of the tell. Excavations in Field F revealed only fragments of a domestic structure and associated finds, and a terrace wall with two subphases of surfaces (Low 1997: 195-202). Field C on the northern slopes produced only a terrace wall and ash layers of the Stratum 12 destruction (Battenfield 1991: 85). While both areas may be extra-urban, we know little about them with any degree of certainty. However, from the remains uncovered on the western end of the tell (Fields A, B, and H) several features of the perimeter wall and defenses are clear, providing a reasonably complete picture of the nature and extent of defensive structures, including a reuse of the Stratum 15 moat at the bottom of the slope, a retaining wall that supported a steep rampart, and long stretches of a perimeter wall not unlike a casemate wall in places. Earlier indications for a gate in Field A have not panned out. The moat, carved during the MB II period (Stratum 15) into the bedrock spur on which 'Umayri's earliest settlement was founded, was six meters across and five meters deep, creating a formidable obstacle against unwanted entry. The retaining wall was built to support the higher level of the new beaten earth rampart of Stratum 12, which was constructed from a mix of clay, nari (crushed limestone), and charcoal to prevent its erosion during the rainy season. The rampart rose at a 35? slope for another five meters along a distance of fifteen meters as it ascended the hill. At the top of the slope a two-meter-thick perimeter wall was constructed into and directly on top of the cresting Stratum 15 rampart. Courses of the wall nearly matched rampart layers, indicating a unified construction to restore the defense system as a whole. Currently surviving to a length of approximately eighty meters along the western edge of the site, the perimeter wall extended from the northwest corner toward the south, curving sharply eastward into the town and then continuing south. Plaster fragments on the exterior wall stones, forming the wall's curve, suggest a monolithic look to the wall, especially near the angle where it turns south. The wall line as it curved into the town was interrupted abruptly due to construction of the Late Iron II Ammonite administrative complex of Stratum 7 and what lay to the east is unknown except for fragmentary discoveries. The inhabitants built three houses immediately inside the western defenses between the Late Bronze building and the curve of the perimeter wall: Building B, on the north (in Field B), has been completely excavated and partially reconstructed; Building A in the middle (in Fields and A), has also been completely excavated; and Building C, on the south, cradled inside the curving perimeter wall (in Field A), has been excavated only partially so far. All were constructed abutting the perimeter wall. North of Building along the perimeter wall, nothing survives from this period. But because late Iron Extending for eighty meters along the western edge of the site, the two-meter-thick perimeter wall (the northern part of which is seen in this photo), belonging to the Late Bronze/Iron Age transitional period, was integrated into the Stratum 12 rampart. 82 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="16">II houses were immediately above the Late Bronze building, we suggest the area was empty during Stratum 12.

An alleyway facing their entrances provided access to courtyards. the two completely excavated buildings. The evidence also suggests at least two phases of building activity. Evidently both buildings initially opened directly onto the alleyway, without the protection of a walled courtyard on the east and with no external dividing wall between their courtyards. Later, courtyards were enclosed in front of the houses. The newly formed courtyard of Building measured over eight meters long and an average of four and a half meters wide, creating thirty-six square meters of newly protected space around the house's entrance. Two entry ways provided access from the alleyway, but in a subsequent phase the most direct one in the southeast corner of the courtyard was walled shut. The courtyard also saw the installation of a paved area, probably an animal pen, which, in the final phase of courtyard renovation, was expanded further. Simultaneous if not directly connected phases of renovation also appeared in the remains of Building A. The general plan of Building A was rectilinear and consisted of four rooms on the ground floor. Its northern wall was shared with Building B. Entry from the eastern courtyard brought ancient inhabitants into Room Al, measuring 5 by 2.7 meters. Remains included a stone-lined bin in a corner, a bench along the eastern wall, a stone-ringed hearth and stone grinding implements, along with numerous broken ceramic vessels on the beaten-earth floor. Immediately west of Room AI was a stone-paved room, Room A2, separated by what must have been a fabric wall supported by wooden posts resting on stone post-bases, or just empty space between the posts. Inside this 2.5-by-2.5 meter room was a large standing stone, resting against the room's western wall, and a large stone presentation altar oriented in front of the standing stone. To the south of Room A2 was a room encompassing an alcove built into the southern wall of the building, Room A4. It measured almost two-by-two meters if the hallway on the north is included. But the rectangular protrusion of the wall was 1.6 meters deep. Stones resting on the floor may have been crude "standing stones" at one point, suggesting a religious use for at least two rooms. Finally, the westernmost room, Room A3, enclosed a space 2.6 meters wide by 4.8 meters long. Inside were seven or eight large-collared pithoi that produced tens of thousands of carbonized grains mostly of barley, but of other typical grains and vegetables as well. A stepped platform was located in the southwest corner of the room. Remains in the destruction rubble filling Building A included building detritus confirming the existence of a second story and articulated faunal remains of at least two butchered animals left behind as the occupants must have departed hastily. Building B, adjacent to Building A on the north, formed a "four-room" or "pillared" house, typical of the Iron Age in the southern Levant (Faust 2006; Ji 1997). Entering from the eastern alleyway (and, later, surrounding courtyard), occupants of this house initially encountered three parallel long rooms, each about 5.4 meters long and 2 meters wide and separated by two rows of five or six wooden posts, set upon stone post bases. The southern long room was paved with mostly small NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 83</page><page sequence="17">The Stratum 12 town suffered a violent end as is apparent in this photo of the Building A remains. At the bottom debris from the roof is visible, while above can be seen the colorful burned and fragmented bricks of the walls from the second story.

With the exception of a few paving stones in the northern long room, most of it and the central long room included beaten-earth floors and part of a stone-ringed hearth still apparent in the floor of the northern room. The presence of a hearth in a roofed portion of the building is curious. How did they solve the choking problem of smoke inside the house? Indeed, it may have been for this reason that the eastern wall, the leeward wall of the building, was not a complete wall. That is, the eastern end seems to have been largely open, perhaps hung with carpets or blankets that could be arranged in a multitude of ways that would allow smoke to issue out of the house, depending on air currents. Toward the back (western portion) of the house and utilizing the perimeter wall at its western side, was the fourth room, a broad room. It produced the vast majority of the remains from the building's estimated forty- to fifty-year occupational history. In this room were found tens of thousands of sherds, mostly from about seventy-five shattered, utilitarian, collared pithoi of the transitional period between LB II and the early part of the Iron I period, along with numerous other ceramic and stone artifacts, five military points, slingstones or pounding stones, and the burned bones of at least four humans splayed across the room as they fell from the upper floor or the roof. Since all of the building had been covered by a massive mudbrick destruction layer, in places up to two meters thick, it was clear that every nondestructible object left in this building at the time of its demise was preserved within the confines of the house. Excavation also indicated that, except for approximately thirty-five to forty collared pithoi set into the ground floor beaten-earth surface (Clark and London 2000) and likely a few additional household implements in the broad room, nothing else among the nearly two hundred objects found in the building came from the floors, but from the destruction debris above the floors. Indeed, the evidence from the amount of preserved mudbrick and the majority of artifacts mixed into the destruction debris as the house collapsed clearly demonstrates the presence of a second story over the entire house, and that most tasks associated with the human occupants of the house occurred upstairs or on the roof. For example, our team discovered a huge basalt lower grindstone upside down within the destruction debris about one meter above the floor, indicating that food milling happened on the second story or even on the roof. The ground floor probably served primarily to house stabled animals and storage containers like pithoi, and space for cooking activities. We have in the remains of the 'Umayri four-room house a treasure trove of architectural and artifactual information on the construction, human activity patterns, and demise of a typical domestic structure. First, the architecture: This particular four-room house is one of the best preserved anywhere and, as well, one of the earliest, so early it slightly antedates what archaeologists usually call Iron Age I, the time period when these houses began to proliferate. Early Iron Age settlements, many boasting four-room houses, appeared primarily in the hill country of Palestine in large numbers, around three hundred. New evidence suggests a similar phenomenon on the eastern side of the Jordan River in what would become Gilead, Ammon, Moab, and Edom in the Iron II period. The number of Jordanian Iron I sites, ranging from excavated settlements to surveyed sherd scatters, is impressive. Building is a "four-room" or "pillared" house, a type typical of the Iron Age in the southern Levant. This photo was taken before the excavators partially reconstructed it. NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 85</page><page sequence="19">IRON I SITES IN JORDAN Here we list the numbers by region, north to south (Clark 2002a; the numbers are based on JADIS, the Jordanian database of sites), realizing that, because some surveys, especially older ones, may have misread the ceramic evidence, the numbers could be inflated: Between the Yarmouk River (near Irbid) and the Wadi az-Zarka (north of Amman) - 155 Between the Wadi Zarka and the Wadi al-Mujib (south of Madaba) - 158 Between the Wadi Mujib and the Wadi al-Hasa (South of Kerak) - 129 Around the Wadi al-Hasa - 75 Of the total of 517 recorded sites, only around fifty have been excavated in some fashion. Thus, we are not in a strong position to assess the nature of all these sites. But what appears to be clear is a rapid explosion of Iron I sites, not unlike that across the Jordan River to the west. And four-room houses appear at many of these locations as well. We experimented with construction techniques of the four room house at 'Umayri by reconstructing much of the ground floor wooden infrastructure and, with no-maintenance, replica construction materials, a good deal of the broad room and the beginnings of the second story (Clark and Herr 2004). This process has allowed us an open window into the labor-intensive practices connected with ancient house construction and the human investment it took to bring a house to completion as well as to maintain it. Specific-gravity measurements of the various construction materials? stone for floors and walls; wood for posts, beams, and cross-beams; reeds for ceilings/floors; mudbrick for the entire second story; lime for plaster and mortar; and mud for flooring/roofing?total over four hundred tons in weight (Clark 2003), demonstrating an immense investment of work and energy. While all of the remains found in the house reflect typical implements and processes of daily life in the southern Levant, the small number of textile artifacts is surprising in light of normal domestic assemblages of spindle whorls and loom weights. Either there was little clothing production in the house or methods other than a vertical loom were utilized. Otherwise, artifacts of food preparation, consumption, and especially storage predominate, as we would expect in the subsistence economy characteristic of common people during the period. The artifacts also provide a unique source of information about 'Umayri's connections with other regions during a time of limited trade and travel (Clark 2007). Also preserved in the collapsed construction material were numerous charred wooden beams and posts, testimony to the fiery demise of the house. Add to these the scattered, burned human bones and military hardware found primarily in the broad room, and a rapid, violent end by military means becomes clear. Building C has not been as completely excavated as Buildings A and B. Its plan is not yet known, but we have reached the floors of two rooms. As was true with Buildings A and B, we discovered many collared pithoi in the back room of the house, this time a quantity of at least fifteen. However, almost all of these contained potters' marks on at least one handle, often on two. The majority of the handles sported a horizontal "V" engraved into the clay on the top of the handle. Gloria London, our ceramic technologist, is presently studying the marks in conjunction with their construction methods and form to determine information about individual potters. Interestingly, only two different marks were evident in significant numbers (a third mark occurred only once). (.? Ktvtnd?

Can we correlate vessel rim form with type of potters' mark? Did each potter make vessel rims in individual ways? The large garbage pit east of Building may have served all three houses. The contents of the pit, with about twenty-five thousand bones, including the bones from a few wild animals as well as primarily domestic creatures, contained no visible sub-layers, though it was at least two meters deep. The broken pottery comprised a heavy number of burned cooking pots. Gloria London has suggested the pit may be connected with activities of feasting at the three houses (personal communication). I (Herr) have suggested that the three houses may have made up a "house of the father," with each house emphasizing different activities: storage in House and cultic activity in House A (Herr 2009). Alternatively, I (Clark) have not been persuaded fully by either suggestion, especially in the case of House B, which appears self contained and thoroughly domestic in nature, even if adjoined by House A and its clear cultic connections. Only fragmentary remains of Stratum 12 have been found so far in Field H, but the finds indicate that more significant domestic architecture will be discovered there in future seasons. Strata 11-10 (Late Iron I) After a probable hiatus during at least the second half of the twelfth century B.C.E., the site was rebuilt, but apparently not on the grand scale of Stratum 12. Only isolated rooms or parts of houses so far attest to the two settlements that date to the later parts of the Iron I period, most likely the eleventh century B.C.E. The changes between the two strata are not clear, because the remains were so fragmentary. But the finds of all types are fundamentally different than those from the preceding strata, suggesting to us that there may have been a slight hiatus between Strata 12 and 11 or that the later settlements were made up of a group different from that of Strata 13-12, though we do not wish to attempt any specific ethnic identity. There was nothing above the destruction of Building B, but into the top of the brick destruction of Stratum 12 in Field A (over Building A) was a storeroom with eighteen collared pithoi embedded in the fallen bricks. The rims and necks of the vessels were significantly different from the scores of examples produced in Stratum 12 (Herr 2001; compare the vessels from this stratum published in Herr 1989a: 351 with those from Stratum 12 in Clark 2002b: 78-91). The necks were short and the rims were upright with a rounded thickening rather than the long necks and flaring, triangular, everted rims of Stratum 12. This significant typological difference was consistent in all other locations, as well. It must represent a period of time between them to account for the typological differences. Thus we suggest a short hiatus?time for the second assemblage to develop. Near the storeroom were fragmentary remains of two phases of at least one domestic dwelling that, except for reusing the perimeter wall, seems to have ignored the wall lines of the previous stratum. These new walls may have been part of the same building as the storeroom. The settlement was not as prosperous as it had been in Stratum 12. That is, the walls were narrower and were built with less skill. Above the destruction of the transitional LB/Iron I dwellings of Stratum 12 in Field H was a large open area, paved with cobbles and resurfaced with plaster floors in Strata 11 and 10. The large open space would have been impossible to roof and seems to have been an open courtyard sanctuary with a small altar or presentation stone in the middle. Parts of at least two model shrines were found on one of the several surfaces in the courtyard (Herr and Clark 2003: 291, fig. 23). We also discovered small fragments of ceramic statues from this time secondarily deposited in the debris layers of later strata, suggesting that the religious function of the space continued throughout several centuries. A courtyard sanctuary in Strata 11 and 10 (Late Iron I) in Field H featured a small altar in the middle. The sanctuary seems to have retained its religious function over several centuries. NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 89</page><page sequence="23">3 In Field L massive walls, up to one and a half meters wide and constructed of very large boulders almost two meters long, seem to date to this period (or as early as Stratum 12), but much more needs to be excavated to know what type of buildings they were. Although about five of these walls have been discovered, excavators have reached the founding level of only one of them. Strata 9-8 (Iron IIA-B) Only a few slipped and hand-burnished potsherds have been found in Fields A, B, and H, suggesting the site was no more than a very minor one in the Iron Age IIA (Stratum 9, tenth to ninth centuries B.C.E.). One of the floors in the courtyard sanctuary in Field H may belong to this stratum, but, except for Strata 11-10, we made very few finds on the floors of this structure. However, during the 2008 season we discovered a house with at least three rooms in Field A that we can securely attribute to the Iron IIB period (Stratum 8, ca. late-ninth to eighth or early-seventh century B.C.E.). Some of the walls were preserved over a meter high and the floors were paved with cobbles or beaten earth. Pottery from this period has been well known at the site for many seasons, but this is the first time we have discovered significant architectural remains. We assume that the courtyard sanctuary in Field H continued to be used during these strata, though many of the surfaces produced very little pottery. Strata 7-6 (Late Iron II/Persian) Major building again took place around the beginning of the sixth century (Stratum 7), probably under the royal patronage of the Ammonite ^r&gt;1!n^HR9H k*n? Ba'alyasha' (biblical Field A is the first significant architectural structure so far found for the Iron IIB period at 'Umayri. The complete plan of the building is not yet known. This Stratum 8 house in The thick walls of this Ammonite administrative Ba'alis of Jer 40:14), whose name we discovered on a seal impression from this time period (Herr 1989b). We also found a large complex of basement rooms with thick walls constructed in a large pit dug into the Iron IIB and Iron I strata (see Lawlor 2000: 22). The floor of the basement level was discovered covering the destruction of Stratum 12 immediately below. 90 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:1 (2009)</page><page sequence="24">This seal impression found on the surface of the site in 1984 belonged to "Milkom'ur the servant of Ba'alyashaV Ba'alyasha' was the Ammonite king likely responsible for the rebuilding of the site around the beginning of the sixth century (Stratum 7). complex, probably meant to support at least a second story, were more massive than most domestic walls. Part of the complex appeared to be constructed in the four-room plan, though a bit larger than most domestic structures of the type (Lawlor 2000: 22). Moreover, several Ammonite inscribed seals and seal impressions, typical of administrative activities, were found in or around the building (Eggler, Herr, and Root 2002). Because we have found only the basement walls and floors, doorways between the rooms were rare. One room, Excavators uncovered a large administrative complex in Stratum 7, Field A, attributable to Ammonite rule. The complex was probably intended to administer the production of wine at the numerous farmsteads within a short distance of the site. Balloon photo by E. and W. Myers. immediately north of the four-room structure, contained a stairway with narrow treads leading to the lower floor. The complex was probably intended to administer the production of wine at many contemporary farmsteads discovered nearby by our survey team (within three to five kilometers). Approximately forty of these farmsteads were discovered, and four of them were excavated by the MPP hinterland survey team (LaBianca 1991). Associated with the structures were multiple winepresses and caves for working and storing the production of the farms. The material cultural finds from the farmsteads were almost identical to those of the administrative complex and its accompanying domestic quarters (below). Indeed, a seal from one of the farmsteads contained a Babylonian artistic scene, much like some of the seals found at 'Umayri. At the same site (Site 84 in the 'Umayri Hinterland Survey recording system supervised by David Hopkins) that produced this seal, excavators found a full assemblage of domestic tools and objects ranging from ground stone tools to jewelry. North of the administrative complex were more modest structures with domestic finds on the floors, probably houses for those who operated the administrative activities (Lawlor 2000: 22). These were not built with basements and the rooms were interconnected by doorways. One complex contained at least seven rooms. Similar large domestic complexes with interconnecting rooms were found nearby at Tall Jawa (Daviau 2002: 9-14). They seem to be characteristic of some Ammonite domestic buildings.

The seven cups shown in the middle of this photo were part of a set made in slightly different sizes so they could all stack together. Other house fragments were found in Field B, complete with several large holemouth pithoi buried almost completely beneath the use surfaces; only the mouths of the vessels were visible. One almost perfectly preserved pithos was empty except for the skeleton of a mouse! One of the houses displayed rows of columns with the space between them filled with loosely packed field stones in a pier-and-quoin construction. Domestic material culture lay on the surfaces of these structures, including a bronze bowl, textile tools, and a series of ceramic bowls, cups, and lamps that had been stacked on a shelf when they fell onto the plaster floor. Indeed, seven cups in a set were made in slightly different sizes so they could all stack together. In Field F, on the eastern edge of the site, we discovered a structure we have called an entry monument. The town was not fortified at this time, but the inhabitants built a structure that looked like half of a four-chambered gate. There was no sign that the other half existed and no city wall was connected to it, but it was formed by a north-south wall with piers jutting out to the east, toward the gently sloping downhill side of the site (Low 1991: 187, fig. 8.11). As in many city gates from the Iron Age, there was a standing stone next to the structure with an adjacent basin, possibly to hold libations or other offerings by people entering (or leaving) the town. Although the settlement of Stratum 7 was not large (only about one hectare), it produced more small finds than any other period. These included many inscribed seals (Eggler, Herr, and Root 2002), ceramic figurines (with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic examples in roughly equal numbers), textile tools, scores of ground stone tools, beads, jewelry, bronze fibulae (the precursors of safety pins), etc. Preliminary photos and/or drawings have been published in the seasonal reports. The Ammonite administrative complex continued into the early Persian period (Stratum 6) with changes to rooms and repairs to the walls of the Stratum 7 structures without an apparent intervening destruction. It was probably from Stratum 6 that five inscribed seal impressions originate, all written in the Aramaic script dating to around 500 B.C.E. Alas, all were found in secondary fills or in topsoil deposits and all are difficult to read. We could not relate them directly to the buildings, but on the basis of the paleography (the forms of the letters), they must have come from this time. They contained two lines of writing, each with three letters. The first line 92 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="26">This is one of five inscribed seal impressions, all written in the Aramaic script and dating to about 500 b.c.e., although all were found in secondary deposits. It mentions the name of an official (here named Shuba') and the name of the province, 'Ammon, and was found in Field A. These lamps come from the Hellenistic period farmstead excavated in Field L normally contained the name of a person, probably an official of the Persian provincial government, while the second line held the three consonants of the name of the province, 'Ammon. The discovery of these impressions is strong evidence that there was a province of 'Ammon in the Persian Empire, a view now accepted as fact by most historians. The seal impressions probably functioned similarly to the yehud (Judah) seals and seal impressions found in the Jerusalem area, that is, as symbols of the authority of the local provincial government. Stratum 5 (Possibly the Persian Period) Above the administrative complex in Field A were fragmentary wall foundations just below topsoil that did not conform to the walls of the administrative complex below. There were no preserved surfaces and, therefore, no clearly associated finds. Usually only one course high, these walls were difficult to date and we can suggest no coherent plan or discernible function for the walls. But the virtual lack of any later pottery in the topsoil and sub-topsoil loci of the area suggests the walls date to the Persian period, that is, to the period immediately following Stratum 6. Perhaps they belonged to private dwellings. The Classical Age We discovered localized remains at various places around the site from the classical and Islamic ages. Strata 4-2 were not site-wide settlements, but only small farms cultivating the region around the spring. Stratum 4 (Hellenistic, 333-63 B.C.E.) In Field L at the southern edge of the site, excavators found two phases of a farmstead whose surfaces produced Hellenistic pottery (Herr and Clark 2005a: 257, fig. 26). It had several rooms on the western side of a courtyard. Especially interesting were about ten handmade juglets that looked much like Iron II dipper juglets. But their context was securely Hellenistic. A large number of pithoi suggests storage of agricultural goods. The walls of the farmstead sometimes reused late Iron II/Persian walls (Stratum 7), though this period was not well represented here. The inhabitants probably farmed the hillsides and the valley floors around the site. A tomb near the bottom of the southeastern slope of the site had a Greek inscription near its entrance: "Year 110, most pious Isidoros" (Merling 1991). Stratum 3 (Early Roman, 63 B.C.E.-135 C.E.) A small plastered ritual pool, probably a miqveh, was found cutting into the domestic houses of Strata 7-6 in the northern part of Field A and the southern part of Field (Lawlor 1991: 38). The plaster lining was very well preserved. A small, steep set of stairs descended into the pool, showing that it was not the bottom part of a small cistern. Two potsherds from the foundation NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009) 93</page><page sequence="27">stones of the pool dated to the Early Roman period. It was most likely all that was left of a villa or farmstead with Jewish inhabitants, if the pool was indeed a miqveh. Stratum 2 (Byzantine, 325 C.E.-640 C.E.) Fragmentary walls of a Byzantine farmstead were found at the eastern edge of the site in Field F. Although no surfaces were discovered, a large amount of pottery was retrieved. The most dominant type of vessel was a flat-based vat, rare at most urban Byzantine sites, probably used in agricultural activities, possibly the grape harvest (Low 1991: 224). We also discovered that the ashlar well house in Field E at the northern foot of the site was constructed at this time (Fisher 1997: 186-7). However, there is no known major site in the immediate area dating to the Byzantine period. There was only the farmstead in Field F and the shallow, scattered remains on the eastern site across the airport highway. It may be that people came from a few kilometers around to draw water from a communal source. The Islamic Age (Stratum 1) Early Islamic (Umayyad and Abbasid) pottery was found in topsoil in many areas, especially beneath rock piles that probably stemmed from field clearance for agricultural activities during the early Middle Ages. Only two Ayyubid/Mamluk sherds were discovered beneath one rock pile in Field A. We also found one or two Ottoman pipes, a sure sign of the arrival of tobacco from the New World. A few modern finds, such as broken teacups, indicate continued light use of the site into the twentieth century, perhaps by Bedouin. Summary Twelve seasons of excavation have shown that there were two major periods of recoverable settlement at Tall al-'Umayri: the Early Bronze Age and the Iron I period. Indeed, the largest settlement at the site dated to EB III, but there does not seem to have been any fortification system. Four strata of Iron I occupation (counting the two transitional strata) probably saw settlement for most of the period, though the second stratum was the most important with major fortifications, and well preserved domestic buildings. Other periods were probably also strongly represented, but their remains have not been recovered as yet in the magnitude of the Early Bronze and Iron I discoveries. These include the MB IIC settlement, which saw the construction of the rampart' and moat, as well as major non-domestic buildings that used large stone construction. The subsequent Late Bronze period was also probably a major one at the site, as the palace/temple shows. The late Iron II/Persian period was also important, though it was probably one of the smallest settlements in the history of the site. Even so, it produced over 50 percent of the small finds we have recovered so far. A major characteristic of the site is the excellent preservation of the architectural finds. Walls stood over a meter high in Strata 14 (LB), 12 (Transitional LB/Iron I), and 7 (late Iron II/Persian). Some were one and a half to two meters high. A few of the EB III walls in Field D approached a meter in height. Another aspect is the way significant settlements are visible horizontally in a panorama across the site, rather than simply in a top to bottom, layered relationship. That is, a visitor to the site standing at a spot to the east of Field A can see MB II remains in the northwest; the Late Bronze Age palace/temple to the north; the partially reconstructed four-room house from the transitional LB/Iron I period in the northern center; the late Iron II/Persian Ammonite administrative complex in the center and south; and the late Iron I courtyard sanctuary to the southwest. There is no suggestion that discoveries of the thick stone architecture in Fields H and L, probably of Iron I date, will abate during future seasons. The significance of these walls needs to be examined in considerably more detail, but it will take much more excavation as the walls seem to be very well preserved, probably well over a meter high and there are many strata above them. Likewise, more work needs to be done in the southwestern portion of the site (Field H) where more significant remains from Stratum 12 are just beginning to emerge. Notes 1. Even the individual walls of the excavated site are visible in Google Earth at 35?52 7.32" North and 35?53,16.75" East. Search for "Amman, Jordan" and then move to those coordinates. 2. Lawrence T. Geraty was the initial director of the project with Larry G. Herr as the Chief Archaeologist. Now, in 2008, Geraty is listed as Founding Director, with Herr and Douglas R. Clark as Co-Directors. The Field Supervisors include: Field A: John I. Lawlor (1984-2004) and Robert Bates (2006-2008); Field B: Douglas R. Clark (1984-2002) and Kent Bramlett (2004-2008); Field C: James Battenfield (1984-1987); Field D: Larry M. Mitchell (1984), Mich?le Daviau (1987), and Tim Harrison (1989-1994); Field E: James Battenfield (1987) and James Fisher (1989); Field F: Russanne Low (1987-1992); Field G: James Fisher (1989); Field H: Lloyd Willis (1994), David Berge (1996-2000, 2004-2006), Julie Cormack (2002); and Monique Vincent (2008); Field K: Elzbieta Dubis (1994-2000, 2008); Field L: David Hopkins and Mary Boyd (2000-2008). Team sizes have varied from about thirty-five foreigners in 2002 (after 9/11) to almost one hundred in 2008. Hired locals made up another fifteen to twenty-five workers each season. The project is a multidisciplinary, educational project that conducts a full range of classes, lectures, and tours around Jordan. Preliminary publications have appeared after every season in both the Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan (Geraty, Herr, and LaBianca 1987; Geraty, Herr, LaBianca, Battenfield, Christopherson et al 1989; Herr et al 1996; Herr and Clark 2003, 2005a, 2009; Herr, Clark, Geraty, and LaBianca 1999; Herr, Clark, and Trenchard 2001; Herr, Geraty, LaBianca, and Younker 1991, 1994; Herr, Geraty, LaBianca, Younker, and Clark 1996, 1997) and Andrews University Seminary Studies (Geraty 1985; Geraty, Herr, and LaBianca 1988; Herr and Clark 2004, 2005b, 2008; Herr, Clark and Trenchard 2002; Younker, Geraty, Herr, and LaBianca 1990, 1993; Younker, Geraty, Herr, LaBianca, and Clark 1996, 1997) the former presenting technical stratigraphie reports and the latter comprising historical and literary discussions. Scientific preliminary reports were also published irregularly in Bulletin of the American Schooh of Oriental Research Supplements series (Geraty, Herr, LaBianca, Battenfield, Boling et al 1986; Geraty, Herr, LaBianca et al 1990; LaBianca et al 1995) Five seasonal reports in large-volume format have been published (a sixth is in press), each with full technical reports for all fields of excavation through the 1998 season, along with articles on objects, artifacts, and samples (Geraty, Herr, LaBianca, Battenfield, Christopherson et al 1989; Herr, Clark, Geraty, Younker, and LaBianca 2000, 2002; Herr, Geraty, LaBianca and Younker, 94 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 72:2 (2009)</page><page sequence="28">ed. 1991, 1997). Other volumes are in preparation. All publications are amply illustrated in black and white drawings and photographs. The excavation manual was written by Herr in 1980 and has been used with only minor changes since then. In the 1990s Gary Christopherson added a section on archaeological survey and both were published together as Herr and Christopherson 1997. With minor changes it has been adopted by the other MPP excavations, additional projects historically related to MPR and a few other excavations in the southern Levant. The original manual was based upon the experience a number of us had with the computerization process of the early Hisban records in 1978. It thus owes many insights to the adaptations Roger Boraas made to the Balata (Shechem) recording procedures. The computerized database utilized the locus sheets and was designed in 1997 by Karen Borstad in Microsoft Access. All locus sheet and object/ artifact records have been entered into the database. The database was used by ETANA (Electronic Tools and Ancient Near Eastern Archives) as one of its test databases before it ended. Matt Vincent has designed a read only web application (please see http://umayri.opendig.org/). This will become the primary site for all on-line publications of the site; items are added periodically as they become ready. Digital photographs since 1996 have also been entered. Other materials, such as old slides and prints, plans, pottery plates, bone listings, flint listings, shells, etc. will be entered as they become available from specialists. Even popular items, such as the weekly reports of the excavation and a large series of Microsoft Powerpoint presentations, will be made available. Any information on the excavations may be downloaded for research purposes. At present there are 3,541 loci in the database. The main web site of the project for information and excavation forms is http://mpp.wallawalla.edu. 3.
