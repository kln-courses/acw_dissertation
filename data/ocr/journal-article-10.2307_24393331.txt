Volz Kenyon College (volzs@kenyon.edu) In August of 1865, venturing far beyond the border of the Cape Colony, the German explorer Gustav Fritsch and his entourage arrived at the community of Moshupa in what is today southeastern Botswana. In addition to admiring the scenic beauty of large granite outcrops in the area, Fritsch was amazed by a large crowd of people, many dressed in European fashions, that gathered on Sunday to sing Christian hymns and listen to preaching by fellow Africans. Several day's journey from the nearest European mission station, Fritsch regarded the African-run worship service as superficial "aping of European customs," but he also saw it as an indication of the supremacy of European civilization over Africans and the inevitable erosion of "the primeval, national structure of their public and private lives" by expanding foreign influence.1 In this assessment, whether promoting or lamenting the spread of "development," Fritsch expressed what would become the dominant view of African-European relations during the colonial era and beyond. Missing from Fritsch's description, however, was an awareness of African perspectives during the decades prior to European conquest, such as those of the "native preacher" who led the worship service in Moshupa and thus ostensibly served as the primary local agent of modernization. Although not identified by Fritsch, the leading African preacher in Moshupa and nearby communities during the 1860s was Paulo Rrafifing Molefane. Like other early African evangelists, Paulo was involved not just in the labor of building the first missions but also in the translation and propagation of Christianity for African audiences and in the mediation of early African-European relations. Paulo was more than an indispensable assistant to Robert Moffat, David Livingstone, and other missionaries. He often worked with little or no European supervision, offering his services as a consultant for Tswana rulers and European missionaries in the ways of the other.2 As ambassador, cultural broker, and purveyor of foreign goods and ideas, Paulo also became involved in the tensions that accompanied a growing European presence during the mid-nineteenth century, and the ties 1 G. Fritsch, Drei Jahre in Süd Afrika (Breslau: Ferdinand Hirt, 1868), 325-27, as translated from the original German by myself. 21 have chosen to refer to Paulo and other Africans by their first names, adopting Tswana practice during the nineteenth century not to have family surnames but rather to identify a man, in order, by his Christian name (if he used one), his Tswana birth name, his father's name, and his paternal grandfather's name. Thus, "Molefane" was most likely the first name of Paulo's father or grandfather, and Paulo's sons used "Paulo" as their last name.

Paulo Rrafifing Molefane was far from being simply an agent of mission Christianity. Rather, he demonstrates the significant levels of contestation, cultural malleability, and individual initiative that arose in the broad, indeterminate borderland between African and European. African Christian agency during the colonial era has already been widely recognized by scholars, but Paulo's life raises fundamental questions about the extent and nature of earlier European influence in Africa during the decades prior to colonial conquest.3 At what point did a few isolated Europeans in the African interior become the vanguard of colonialism? In Moshupa during the 1860s, were Sunday worship services, the acquisition of European goods, and Gustav Fritsch's portraits of "natives" best understood as evidence of Tswana weakness and subjugation, or rather of their prosperity and resilience?4 There is a lingering tendency to regard the activities of European explorers, missionaries, and merchants before 1870 as proto-colonial exploitation of an African periphery by an industrializing European core. But such privileging of European ambitions and anticipation of eventual conquest ignores the ability of Africans during much of the century to profit from their relationship with Europeans and maintain control over their lives and resources. Recurring discussions of the "colonial frontier" have come to regard that term as inadequate for describing what is more accurately understood as a zone of interaction between different societies than the front line of European expansion. The roles of African Christian evangelists in that borderland merit greater scholarly attention.5 African evangelists, nominally affiliated with European institutions while retaining African identities, personified the complex reality of African-European relations, and their lives testified to the possibilities and limitations of African efforts to benefit from their encounter with Europeans. Mediation by African evangelists was particularly important prior to the European scramble, as many African communities, though increasingly stressed, expected to continue to adapt to changing circumstances and retain their relative autonomy from Europeans. Recent scholarship has illustrated that the first Africans to adopt the beliefs and practices of Christianity and share them with others during the nineteenth century cannot be understood simply as either unwitting accomplices of 3 For scholarship on the significance of African evangelists during the colonial era, see for example B.

First was the early production of a vernacular Tswana Bible, the earliest complete translation in a sub-Saharan 6 See for example, J.D. Peel, Religious Encounter and the Making of the Yoruba (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000), and S. Volz, African Teachers on the Colonial Frontier: Tswana Evangelists and Their Communities During the Nineteenth Century (New York: Peter Lang, 2011). 7 For more on the central role played by Khoe-European "Griqua" in the frontier zone north of the Cape Colony, see the influential 1969 Ph.D. thesis of M. Legassick, recently published as The Politics of a South Africa Frontier: The Griqua, the Sotho-Tswana and the Missionaries, 1780-1840 (Basel: Basler Afrika Bibliographien, 2011). For the Khoekhoe, see E. Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions, and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2008), and for the Xhosa, see Jeff Peires, The Dead Will Arise: Nongqawuse and the Great Cattle-Killing Movement of1856-7 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989). 9 For Cupido Kakkerlak, see V.C.

Levine, A Living Man From Africa: Jan Tzatsoe, Xhosa Chief and Missionary, and the Making of Nineteenth-Century South Africa (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011). "Sotho-Tswana" refers to culturally-related groups in the interior of southern Africa that are linguistically distinct from neighboring Nguni, Shona, Khoe and other peoples. For scholarship on the success of Sotho-Tswana rulers, see for example L. Thompson, Survival in Two Worlds: Moshoeshoe of Lesotho, 1786-1870 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975); N.

Second was the establishment of most congregations within Tswana communities under the patronage of Tswana rulers rather than at separate European-mn mission stations. In contrast to the later adage that Africans gained the Bible while losing their land, most Tswana converts during the mid-nineteenth century, including many members of ruling families, managed to possess both. The "word of God" and the dominant social milieu were not European but Tswana, and Tswana converts were able to selectively adopt the teachings and fashions of Christianity with minimal interference by Europeans.11 This assertion challenges a persistent assumption that European influence, including the introduction of Christianity, had a coercive and overwhelming impact throughout the history of European involvement in Africa. Enabled by a relative lack of testimony from Africans to present alternate narratives, there is a tendency to compress events of the nineteenth century together as a general precursor to inevitable colonization, projecting later European power and views back into earlier times. Most prominent among these lines of inquiry is the work of anthropologists Jean and John Comaroff.12 Their detailed and perceptive analysis emphasizes the dialectic nature of Tswana-European interactions, but Europeans nevertheless dominate their portrayal of that conversation, with Tswana drawn into European modes of discourse and eventual "colonization" of their "consciousness" through their engagement with missionaries.13 In a chapter titled "Preachers and Prophets," the Comaroffs acknowledge the ability of African evangelists to "domesticate the Word," but they focus primarily on later cases and situate them firmly within the larger story of gradual European domination.14 Missing from that narrative, and from virtually all histories thus far of Christianity in southern Africa, are the specific African evangelists who operated in the interior prior to the Mineral Revolution and subsequent British conquest, beyond the reach of European control.15 11 This acculturation of Christianity by other Africans has been well described in works such as R. Gray, Black Christians and White Missionaries (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990), and L. Sanneh, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll: Orbis Books, 1996). J. Comaroff and J. Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2 vols. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press: 1991, 1997). For related views, see D.

It is a testament to Paulo's importance, however, that, although his name rarely appears in more than one sentence in any document, he and his family members were repeatedly mentioned by missionaries, travelers, and other Europeans. By carefully assembling those many scattered bits of information, one can construct a narrative of Paulo's life and his intertwined connections with both Africans and Europeans, offered here in a three-part analysis of his roles as a family man, wagon driver, and evangelist. In focusing on Paulo Rrafifing Molefane— rather than European missionaries, African rulers, or abstract modernity—one finds a life that straddled the frontier, promoting beliefs, practices, and goods that were introduced by foreigners while simultaneously seeking closer affiliation with African communities than with foreign mission agencies. An African Christian Family Paulo's earliest appearance in the historical record is on the first line of the church roster at Kuruman, a community founded by agents of the London Missionary Society (LMS) as the first mission north of the Orange River in southern Africa. On 5 July 1829, Paulo and his wife Sara, along with their two sons Isaka and Hendrick, were the first Tswana baptized by the Scottish missionary Robert Moffat.16 Together with the Griqua couple Rachel and Joseph Arend, who were also baptized that day, they formed the core of the fledgling congregation. As envisioned by Moffat and other missionaries, baptism initiated African converts into a universal Christian family under the authority of a heavenly father, but this contrasted with Tswana ideas of communal affiliation through submission to the authority of a senior family and its leader. Paulo realized some benefit from becoming a "brother in Christ" unrestrained by certain familial duties. Ultimately, however, his Tswana ties took precedence, and the patronage of Tswana rulers proved to be more reliable than that of European missionaries. There is very little information regarding Paulo's life prior to his baptism. He was probably born sometime during the 1790s, but nothing is recorded of his parents or childhood. He was called Rrafifing (father of darkness), in apparent reference to a night time male suitor and therefore some suspicion about the identity of his father. At his baptism Rrafifing adopted the more appropriately Christian name of the biblical evangelist primarily on cases after 1865. Limited knowledge of earlier Tswana evangelists is exemplified by the conflation of Paulo with his brother as "Paulo Mebalwe," in J.M. Chirenje, A History of Northern Botswana, 1850-1910 (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1977), 312. 16 "Roll of Church Members" (RL) and "Baptismal Register" (BP) in the Kuruman Church Record Book (KCRB), box A3, Robert Moffat Library, Moffat Mission, Kuruman (KRM).</page><page sequence="6">106 Stephen Volz Paul, or "Paulo" in Tswana.17 Before pursuing the same vocation as his namesake, Paulo had been "quite a dandy—short of stature with round and shining limbs polished fr. head to toe with grease &amp; red ochre."18 He also had two wives who quarreled with one another, and "He, being of a mild &amp; gentle nature, was unable to bring about reconciliation." Eventually one of them ran away, and Rrafifing became interested in Christianity, freeing himself from the demands of a polygamous household and potential concerns about his own paternal lineage. According to David Livingstone, Paulo's "family name" was Molefane, and he was a member of the Tshwene, a small group that had split from the Hurutshe many years earlier and had become attached to the Tlhaping.19 The Hurutshe had been a prominent group for several centuries, centered in 1820 at Kaditshwene (near modern-day Zeerust in South Africa). During the 1820s, weakened by earlier divisions, the Hurutshe were severely disrupted by the widespread social upheavals on the highveld known as the Difaqane (scattering), and many of them sought refuge with other groups further west and south. The Tlhaping were the dominant group in the southwest, and they were able to escape the worst of the violence by their location on the edge of the disrupted region and by their alliance with neighboring Griqua, mixed-race and multi-lingual emigrants from the Cape Colony who were equipped with horses and guns. Although the Tlhaping were forced to scatter during the mid-1820s, by the 1830s they had managed to regroup in a number of communities along the lower Kolong (Harts) River and Ky Gariep (Vaal River) and soon regained their former strength. In the midst of these various African groups were a small number of itinerant Europeans who first visited the region in 1801 and gradually sought to establish a more permanent presence. LMS missionaries settled with the Griqua community of Klaarwater (Griquatown) during the first decade of the century and, with the assistance of Griqua and Khoekhoe converts, established a mission at the Tlhaping community of Dithakong in 1816. The missionary James Read convinced the Tlhaping kgosi (chief, king) Mothibi to move further west to the Kudumane River in search of a dependable water source, but when the majority of the Tlhaping chose to move back east again in the mid-1820s, the mission, now under the leadership of Robert Moffat, decided to stay in the Kudumane (Kuruman) valley and focused their evangelism on non-Tlhaping refugees and other people settled nearby. The first converts at Kuruman were accordingly from those families who, though officially still under Tlhaping rule, had developed a close association with the mission and remained to participate in its growth. Residents were not required to be 17 David Livingstone, 17 Mar. 1847, in I. Schapera, ed., Livingstone's Missionary Correspondence (London: Chatto and Windus, 1961), 102.

The term "Tswana"—or more broadly "Sotho-Tswana"—was only gradually adopted as a generic ethno-linguistic label for peoples in the interior of southern Africa, and most groups during the nineteenth century instead identified themselves by their chiefdom, ancestral lineage or totemic affiliation, such as the "Tshwene," "Hurutshe," "Tlhaping," "Kwena," and others mentioned in this article.</page><page sequence="7">The Life and Times of Paulo Rrafifing Molefane 107 converts, but in exchange for access to irrigated fields, they were expected by missionaries to attend worship services and be productive, law-abiding members of the community. Paulo became an important member of the extended Christian family that developed at Kuruman during the 1830s. He frequently led prayer services and Sunday lessons, and he accompanied Robert Moffat and other members of the Moffat family as their driver and guide on several long journeys. As Mary Moffat remarked of Paulo after a trip in 1833, Not having my husband with me I had occasion to put the more confidence in him, and truly it was not misplaced. He has proved himself faithful, did everything in his power to make me comfortable, and managed the rest of them admirably. I assure you that I had continual joy in him as a brother in our Lord Jesus Christ.20 Paulo's wife and children developed similarly close ties with missionary families, and other relatives of theirs soon joined the Kuruman congregation, including Paulo's brother Mebalwe, who also became a successful evangelist21 Robert Moffat assumed the position of patriarch over the community, signified by his large beard and a leopard-skin jacket, but his dominant personality and strict authority provoked dissension.22 Moffat was very sensitive about perceptions of his ability as a missionary, and he resented the greater success of the Griquatown mission in fostering ties with local rulers and starting congregations in nearby communities.23 This rivalry escalated into open confrontation during an adultery scandal involving the families of Paulo and Moffat. Being "a great favorite" of Moffat's wife Mary, Paulo accompanied her as wagon driver on a long journey to the Cape from November 1835 to June 1836.24 While Paulo and Mary were gone, Paulo's wife Sara in Kuruman became pregnant, and when the baby girl was baptized in February 1837, it became evident that the father was a European.25 Suspicion was cast on Robert Moffat, who had baptized the baby without disciplining Sara 20 1 Oct. 1833, in J.S. Moffat, The Lives of Robert and Mary Moffat (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1885), 178. 21 Correspondence among Moffat family members occasionally includes gossip about Paulo's family members. Several of Paulo's children were baptized during the 1830s, and Mebalwe was baptized on 11 March 1838, three months after his wife and daughter, as recorded in KRM A3, KCRB/BP and KCRB/RL, 120,122. 22 G. Thompson, Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa (London: Henry Colburn, 1827), 88, 96. Mary Moffat also sewed a leopard-skin vest for the LMS administrator John Campbell when he visited in 1820. 23 Most of the missionaries stationed at Kuruman complained at some point about working under Moffat. See for example Hughes, 1 Dec. 1827, CWM SAI 10/3/B; J. Baillie, 16 Aug. 1832, CWM SAI 13/2/D, and 23 Oct. 1834, CWM SAI 14/2/B; and R. Edwards, 18 July 1836, CWM SAI 15/2/D.

In 1838, after two Griqua evangelists visited Paulo in Kuruman to enquire about the truth of the rumor, Paulo brought the matter to Moffat's attention, and it quickly escalated into a bitter feud between the LMS missionaries at Kuruman and Griquatown. Shocked by the rumor, Moffat vehemently denied it and accused the Griquatown missionaries of complicity in a plot by Griqua to weaken the influence of the Kuruman mission and extend their own control over Tswana villages and congregations. The Griquatown missionaries, meanwhile, traced the spread of the rumor to the Tlhaping ruler Mahura and blamed Moffat for his failure to win the trust of the people. In the acrimonious exchange of long letters, the discovery of the child's father—a British traveler named Lieutenant Maul trie—received only a marginal note, while each mission claimed to represent the best interests of the Tswana, asserting ownership over growing congregations in the process.26 At the heart of the controversy was the fact that, contrary to the intentions of Moffat and many missionaries based in the Cape Colony, Christianity in the interior of southern Africa was attracting the most attention not at European-run mission stations such as Kuruman but rather at congregations led by the sons, nephews and junior brothers of African rulers in their own communities. Impressed by the efficacy of European technology and the teachings of the Bible, these "influential young men" became resident experts in the ways of the foreigners, managing them for the benefit of ruling families as well as their own advancement. While converts at mission stations tended to be marginalized individuals seeking refuge with missionaries, congregations in populous Tswana capitals were dominated by members of prominent families and relied on the patronage of a kgosi.27 As many early Tswana Christian congregations were founded on local, patriarchal, and elite lines, Tswana women had mixed reactions to their teachings. After visiting the Tlhaping in 1825, the LMS administrator John Philip noted: The females are much more averse to the change than the men: they appear to be much more strongly wedded to their superstitions, and, generally speaking, they not only refuse to attend worship themselves, but do all in their power to prejudice the minds of the men, and to detain them from attending the preaching of the gospel 28 Missionaries aimed to liberate Tswana women from agricultural labor, commerce, initiation rites and polygamy, along with their attendant "superstitions," but women who were not at the extreme top or bottom of the social scale depended more on the continuation of those practices. As a result, female membership in congregations often consisted primarily of an evangelist's family members, a few relatives of the kgosi, and a 26 Hamilton, Moffat, and Edwards, 25 Sep. 1838, CWM SA1 16/2/E.

Missionaries made no mention of Sara's or Paulo's thoughts during the adultery controversy, but it seems reasonable to assume that they were eager to distance themselves from the scandal and its attendant missionary acrimony, and they soon left Kuruman to seek affiliation with communities further north. Paulo first went to a group of Kwena at Dithubaruba, but when their leader was killed and most of them came under the rule of Sechele at Tshonwane, Paulo joined his brother Mebalwe and David Livingstone at a newly-established mission there and made plans to head farther east.29 When Sechele and his Kwena moved from Tshonwane to Kolobeng in 1847, Paulo helped Mebalwe and Livingstone build the new mission, but he continued to pursue his own goal of starting a new congregation elsewhere. Paulo and Livingstone visited several eastern Tswana groups between 1846 and 1849, and, at the invitation of Kgosi Mokgatle, made plans for Paulo to settle with the Fokeng. But Boer opposition to British missionary support for independent chiefdoms forced Paulo to focus his efforts farther west.30 During an outbreak of Boer Tswana warfare in 1852, Paulo was obliged to retreat to Kuruman, but he soon returned north to reside and work in various Tswana communities for the remainder of his career. As leading Christians, Paulo and other Tswana evangelists were expected by missionaries to enforce European standards of Christian behavior, but obligations to their families and local communities usually took precedence. In 1849 at Kolobeng, for example, when the wives of Paulo and Mebalwe used unspecified "enchantments" and Paulo's son Isaka impregnated a girl who then died in childbirth, Livingstone was upset to find that "the teachers must have known of it and kept me in ignorance."31 He angrily suspended both families from communion and stopped the evangelists' salaries. Although Isaka gladly left the mission, Paulo refused to leave and instead stood by his wife Sara, who was grief-stricken at the departure of her son.32 While Livingstone subsequently abandoned mission work among the Tswana—and his family—to pursue a more promising career as an explorer, Paulo became more closely 29 Livingstone, 17 Oct. 1845, in Schapera, ed., Missionary Correspondence, 81; Ashton, 28 Oct. 1845, Council for World Mission (CWM) archives at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, South Africa incoming correspondence (SAI), box 21/folder 1/jacket B. 30 An early journey is described by Livingstone, in 17 Mar. 1847, Schapera, ed., Missionary Correspondence, 95-96, and Paulo's attempts in 1848 are mentioned by Livingstone in 1 Nov. 1848 and 26 May 1849, Schapera, ed., Missionary Correspondence, 121,126-30; 23 Mar. 1849 in I.

Paulo's son Hendrick married one of Kgosi Sechele's daughters, Kereboletswe, and after Paulo moved to Sechele's village in 1857, Hendrick served as the ruler's representative and Paulo's son Isaka as his scribe.33 In this service to Sechele, they followed the example of their father, who had previously acted as an envoy for Sechele to nearby Boers.34 Paulo's family also developed close ties with fellow émigrés from Kuruman who founded a community at Ranaka, and Paulo's adopted daughter Hesse, the product of Sara's 1836 affair, "respectably married" a member of the Tshidi Rolong.35 As Paulo's place of employment changed over the years, he maintained connections with several different communities, fostering an extended Christian family that was rooted more in the dikgotla (courtyards) of Tswana dikgosi than the distant mission station of Kuruman. Although Kuruman would remain an important locus of Tswana Christianity, with several dikgosi sending their children to be educated there, Christianity attracted more interest in Tswana communities as adopted by prominent Tswana families than as the strange ways of Makgowa (Europeans). Despite being christened "Paul" and identified by Europeans primarily as an agent of the LMS, he would be remembered by northern Tswana as "Rrafifing," a southern immigrant who made a new home for himself among them.36 Driving a Wagon of God When Paulo left Kuruman in 1845 to pursue new opportunities farther north, he did so during a general trade boom in the interior of southern Africa. Responding to increased demand by Europeans, Africans exported large quantities of ivory, ostrich feathers, and other wildlife products to the Cape Colony and Mozambique in exchange for guns, cloth, tools, and beads. Although this exchange of raw materials for manufactured goods indicates a long-term imbalance in favor of Europeans, the immediate impact on Tswana communities was a rapid expansion of their wealth and power. As with the reception of Christianity by Tswana families, this increased exposure to European ways was managed 33 Sechele's son-in-law "Henrik" acted as a Setswana-Dutch translator and brought HMS missionaries to Dithubaruba in July 1857, as described by Dorette Schröder, along with a letter written in Setswana by "Isaca" from Sechele, in Hermannsburger Missionsblatt (HMB) 5, 1 (1858), 6-15.

Equipped with wagons, guns, and teams of oxen, Tswana and neighboring Africans developed networks of hunting areas, trade routes, and depots, patronized and taxed by various local rulers. Among the items conveyed into the interior were Bibles and other Christian publications from Kuruman, and their teachings soon attracted the interest of some northern Tswana. As in the south, though potentially disruptive, the foreign goods and ideas gained purchase as they were appropriated by ruling families for the benefit of their communities, not as a European-led invasion.37 Missionaries had long hoped that southern Tswana Christians would someday leave their homes to carry the European-supplied Gospel farther inland, but the strong ties that most of the first evangelists had with their communities made it unlikely that they would be willing or able to work as strangers in villages farther north. As David Livingstone observed in 1844, "Suitable individuals are generally so wedged and dove-tailed among their relatives, I fear some time must yet elapse ere that means of spreading the Gospel can be extensively brought into operation."38 Since most southern Tswana evangelists, as members of leading families, were prevented by social obligations from moving north, Paulo and other early evangelists in the interior were instead mostly members of subordinate families. As the missionary John Mackenzie described on his first trip north, "most of my Kuruman men were Batshwene who were vassals of the Batlhaping" but who "had become free indeed, through faith in Jesus Christ."39 In addition to whatever spiritual liberation Christianity might provide, association with missionaries and adoption of European styles could also serve as vehicles for Tswana converts to escape subservient status and acquire wealth. Without significant quantities of goods to share, however, Tswana travelers in the garb of Makgowa and preaching strange words would be regarded not as sophisticated elites but as foolish strangers. Evangelists would need to become valued, integral residents of a northern community in order to secure chiefly patronage. One effective way to do so was as dingaka (doctors). As one European hunter at the time observed, rainmakers and other doctors "invariably practice their arts among tribes remote from their own particular districts."40 With evangelists seen as itinerant dingaka, their exotic clothing and esoteric knowledge would signify their expertise and skill, rather than alienate them, and help to win audiences for their teaching. Tswana evangelists accordingly served as religious specialists, healers, and chiefly advisors, and several of them had backgrounds and training as dingaka 41 David Livingstone similarly accepted the title of "Ngaka," and he and other 37 This analysis differs from a greater emphasis on European objectives in R.

As Robert Moffat commented during an early journey north, "Most of the people here (Bamanguato) never saw a waggon before, and their remarks respecting it are extremely ludicrous. 'It is', they say, 'god', and the wheels are gods and this and that is god. When the question is put, what 'god' is, and where he dwells, they are bewildered."43 Although Tswana would eventually regard the anthropomorphic Christian God as "Modimo," Christianity and its accoutrements were initially received by Tswana as manifestations of a more impersonal and intractable modimo 44 The primary figures responsible for managing traffic in modimo were Tswana dikgosi, and Kgosi Sechele of the Kwena was particularly active in promoting the expansion of trade and Christianity. As chief sponsor of Livingstone's "discovery" of Lake Ngami, Sechele played a major role in opening the route to northern elephant herds, and he gained control of the resulting trade through his patronage of southern Tswana travelers, European traders, and local hunters in the Kalahari.45 Like other dikgosi, Sechele also constructed the church for the Christian congregation in his community, and he furthermore acted as an evangelist himself, acquiring great familiarity with the Bible and 41 The most notable case of a Tswana ngaka and evangelist is Maphakela Lekalake, whose life is recounted in A.E.

While missionaries frequently commented on "the peculiar and irregular character of Sechele" and his position "as not only the Chief but the Teacher of his tribe," European hunters complained about the difficulty of controlling African workers who "were under Sechele's government, and did not care a fig for the Boers and their laws."47 After acquiring credentials as a Christian ngaka, wagon-driving skills, and funds to buy his own wagon while based at Kuruman, Paulo's northern career focused on the capitals of Sechele and other Tswana rulers. Following his retreat from Boer-Tswana warfare in 1852, Paulo returned north in 1854 with a group of Kuruman residents, at the invitation of Kgosi Moilwe, to settle at the Hurutshe community of Powe (Dinokana), which had managed to secure some measure of peace with nearby Boers.48 After three years with Moilwe, Paulo decided to rejoin Sechele, who had been baptized in 1848 but had been without an evangelist or missionary since 1852.49 Paulo arrived at Sechele's capital of Dithubaruba in 1857, followed by his son Hendrick and a "large crowd of people" that included several fellow "runaways from the Kuruman."50 After an interlude at Kuruman, taking charge of the mission station while Moffat was away on an extended journey in 1859, Paulo returned north and proceeded to reside and work as an evangelist for the Mmanaana Kgatla led by Mosielele at Moshupa.51 He remained there for seven years until the LMS missionary Roger Price, married to Moffat's daughter Elizabeth, asked him to once again rejoin Sechele's community, where the LMS was re-establishing its official presence after a fifteen-year absence. Paulo relocated and acted as the main preacher for Tswana groups that had settled on the southern edge of Sechele's new capital of Molepolole, leading services at the mission station in the valley while Price served the royal congregation on the hilltop.52 46 For more on the role of Christianity in Sechele's reign, see S.

In 1845, the hunter Roualeyn Gordon Cumming hired Isaka as a Dutch-Tswana interpreter but soon faced criticism from the evangelist's son for his reckless and dangerous behavior.53 After Isaka was almost killed during one chase, "at night, over the fire, he informed my men that I was mad, and that any man who followed me was going headlong to his own destruction."54 Cumming also resented having to pay taxes to Sechele for hunting in the area of the Kwena, and he felt certain "that Isaac, my interpreter, was in league with the Baquaines in their designs against me."55 When Isaka abandoned the suspicious hunter, Livingstone convinced Isaka to continue northward, but after Cumming dismissed him a few months later, the adventurer was abandoned by the rest of his "servants" and had to be rescued by the evangelist Mebalwe.56 Despite such episodes, Paulo's sons continued to trade and act as agents for Tswana rulers, as indicated by a Tswana letter sent by Hendrick to Robert Moffat in 1864 relaying an urgent request from Kgosi Mankopane of the Mapela Laka that an evangelist join his community.57 Although missionaries depended on the diplomacy and wagons of Tswana travelers in establishing interior missions and welcomed their occasional voluntary evangelism, they also were concerned that Christian faith might be weakened by such a nomadic lifestyle. In general, European missionaries preferred Tswana converts to adopt European-style land tenancy and reside in one place where they might invest their accumulated resources in permanent structures and regularly attend school and church.58 As the ivory rush started, Edward Solomon expressed concern about hunters and their "absence from their families and the means of grace for five or six months, living that time a rude and certainly not the most civilized kind of life."59 Moffat similarly worried, "Elephant hunters among the natives invariably retrograde in everything that is good," and William Ashton had difficulty keeping workers at the Kuruman printing press due to their fondness for "roaming about with waggons &amp; hunting."60 The trade boom and spread of Christianity in the interior of southern Africa during the mid-nineteenth century were propelled primarily not by Europeans but by Africans equipped with their own teams of oxen and understandings of how European goods and ideas might benefit their communities. It was Africans who initiated and managed the 53 Isaka was hired at Kuruman in May 1845 at the recommendation of Moffat, in Cumming, Hunter's Life, 1: 197-98,209. 54 Cumming, Hunter's Life, 1: 213. 55 Ibid, 1:236-39. 56 Ibid., 1: 209, 320; 2: 38, 42-44, 54.

Similarly, while Paulo and other Tswana evangelists worked to spread Christianity, it was usually not in the guise of a European-led global church but rather as separate congregations under the patronage of local rulers, sharing only a common reverence for the "word of God." As Africans fled toward the Kalahari to escape European encroachment, ultimately laying the foundations of modern day Botswana, they maintained a distinction between European modimo and European control, accepting the former while rejecting the latter.61 A Superior Man in Knowledge While fostering ties with Tswana rulers through family connections and his services as a purveyor of modimo, Paulo Rrafifing Molefane also worked with European missionaries to promote beliefs and behaviors that had been introduced by them. The resulting dominant European identification of Rrafifing as an agent of mission Christianity named "Paul" is complicated, however, by evidence that he often operated on his own initiative with little support from missionaries. By all accounts, his Christian faith was steadfast and earnest, but his evangelism was based on his own interpretation of Tswana scriptures, with missionaries providing only occasional instruction or assistance. Paulo Rrafifing's Christianity was shaped less by missionary design than by the knowledge and experiences that he gained while navigating across the borderland between Africans and Europeans. From the perspective of European missionaries, what was most notable about Paulo was his knowledge of Christian teachings and his ability to explain them to fellow Tswana in ways that stimulated their interest and earned their respect. Missionaries repeatedly praised Paulo for his skill and integrity. When Paulo left Kuruman in 1845 to venture northward, William Ashton described him as "wise and judicious, &amp; I doubt not but that he will be the most effective among all the native teachers."62 Livingstone echoed that sentiment, judging Paulo to be "quite a superior man in knowledge &amp; his walk is all we can desire," and "I do not expect soon to find one better adapted for commencing a station than Paul."63 Moffat was similarly impressed with Paulo's abilities, declaring, "he is one of the best of men, devout, well-informed &amp; laborious, &amp; whom all love," and "Paulo is universally esteemed wherever he is &amp; is by far the best native theologian in the country."64 Paulo demonstrated this skill and enthusiasm already at the time of his baptism, as he and other new converts played leading roles in evangelizing those residing near the Kuruman mission. One month after Paulo's baptism, missionaries reported that he and another convert "seem to possess good gifts in prayer &amp; they have commenced a Prayer 61 For more on Tswana differentiation between Christianity and colonialism, see S.

Aaron was a prosperous trader and farmer, in control of his own section of land upstream from the Kuruman mission, and he had acted as patron rather than client to the missionaries, negotiating their safety from Griqua marauders and financing the construction of the first mission buildings.70 As a refugee and member of a minor Tswana group, Paulo arguably was more dependent on missionaries, but he also exercised considerable leadership. During a visit to Mzilikazi with Robert Moffat and the explorer Andrew Smith in 1835, for example, Paulo acted not simply as Moffat's driver but also as his representative and fellow diplomat, receiving gifts for Moffat and himself from Mzilikazi.71 During the 1840s, pressured by rivalry with Griquatown and the admonishments of LMS administrators to utilize more "native agency," Kuruman missionaries asserted more 65 Moffat and Hamilton, 12 Aug. 1829, CWM SAI 11/3/D. 66 Moffat, Hamilton and Edwards, 30 Sep. 1833, CWM SAI 13/4/E. 67 Moffat, 10 Jan. 1833, CWM SAI 13/4/E; Moffat, Hamilton and Edwards, 30 Sep. 1833, CWM SAI 13/4/E.

After venturing northward, Paulo operated on his own much of the time, but he also periodically received a nominal salary in the form of tools, food, and other supplies from Kuruman, and his credentials as an expert in Christianity were reinforced by missionary visits. Salaries for early LMS evangelists were provided by sponsors in Britain and were relatively small compared to the needs of the evangelists (less than £12 worth of goods per year), but they signified affiliation with the mission society. Paulo was also a member of "Lontone" (the LMS) by virtue of his baptism, and he maintained close ties with others from Kuruman who had moved north. Despite Paulo's ties to LMS missionaries, however, they were usually more dependent on him than he was on them. Paulo's departure from Kuruman in 1845 to conduct evangelism in northern communities was largely on his own initiative, and even when stationed with European missionaries, he usually played a leading role. After Paulo joined Mebalwe and Livingstone with the Kwena, he became instrumental in Sechele's conversion to Christianity. During the first year at Kolobeng, Paulo sometimes conducted a prayer service in Sechele's home, and when Sechele decided to become baptized in 1848, Livingstone noted that the kgosi "had spoken to Paul about what God had done for his soul, and on the subject of prayer, before he opened his mind to me."72 During a two month probationary period before his baptism, Sechele faced great opposition from the Kwena, who feared that their kgosV s renunciation of his religious duties would destroy the community. Livingstone was concerned that Sechele might be wavering in his decision, but he felt unqualified to judge without advice from Paulo, who was absent after being called suddenly to Kuruman by the death of a son: "We should have been glad had Paul been here for the sake of his experience in such matters. I feel my heart trembling when I think of the danger of receiving one who may not be a true believer, or refusing one who is."73 Livingstone was grateful when Paulo returned in time to verify Sechele's sincerity and calm people's fears about baptism.74 Similarly, when Sechele appeared to break his Christian vows a few months later, Livingstone consulted with Paulo before deciding to suspend Sechele from membership.75 Throughout Paulo's career, missionaries relied on his wisdom as an experienced Tswana Christian to help guide their evangelism. When German Lutheran missionaries of the Hermannsburger Mission Society (HMS) arrived at Dithubaruba in 1857 with virtually no knowledge of Tswana language or culture, they depended on Paulo's assistance. As Bessie (Elizabeth) Moffat remarked of the Germans' situation, "Paul seems to be the sole preacher, their Dutch being so Germanized that they cannot find a suitable interpreter &amp; only keep school, &amp;c."76 The HMS missionary Heinrich Schröder himself reported seeking 72 14 Oct. 1847, in Schapera, ed., Family Letters, 1: 219; and Schapera, ed., Private Journals, 300. 73 2 Sep. 1848, in Schapera, ed., Family Letters, 1: 255-56. 74 Livingstone, 1 Nov. 1848, in Schapera, ed., Family Letters, 1: 260-61.

As recounted by Mackenzie, "It was my custom to read over what I had written in the hearing of Paul, the native teacher, who stopped me when I used a wrong word or expression. At first I troubled the good man sadly by asking him in my ignorance why it was as he said, and not as I had rendered it. This seemed to him an unnecessary question. It simply was so—that was all he knew."78 At Dithubaruba, Paulo's valuable services became a matter of contention between Robert Moffat, Kgosi Sechele, and the German missionaries. Moffat felt that Paulo could work with the HMS missionaries if he wanted, but only if they assumed payment of his salary. Paulo was apparently unwilling to break his ties with either Sechele or Kuruman, and Sechele protested that "he could not let Paul go, he was to be his miss'y and the Germans those of the tribes who have gathered round him!"79 When Moffat insisted that "the interests of the two Societies should be kept separate," Sechele suggested expelling the HMS missionaries.80 Moffat, however, defended them, arguing "the missionaries were not his servants" but "the servants of the churches at home who fed and clothed them."81 Although Paulo retained his affiliation with Kuruman, he stayed at Dithubaruba for several more months and did not transfer to the Ngwato or Rolong, as suggested by Moffat, but instead made his own arrangements to work with the Mmanaana Kgatla, closer to Sechele. The German missionaries, meanwhile, with unrealistic hopes of farming in the Kalahari sandveld and unable to survive on the minimal support provided by the HMS, worked more as blacksmiths, masons, and diplomats for Sechele than as "servants" of the HMS, and they were soon expelled from the mission agency for their apparent insubordination.82 When LMS missionaries resumed their mission with Sechele several years later, Paulo once again accompanied them and, in his old age, would "sit for hours in the Kraal—in the winter sun, after the cattle had gone to graze—with his hymn book, repeating the words softly to himself."83 The preponderance of written references to Paulo, authored by missionaries, tend to portray him as a trustworthy servant whose Christian faith was his most significant attribute, but his success in the eyes of fellow Africans depended more on his ability to form ties with local communities and establish a reputation as a valuable religious specialist and advisor for African rulers. Paulo's Christianity was undoubtedly an integral part of his identity, but its influence depended upon it being translated into African terms 77 See Schröder 11 Jul 1858, as published in HMB 6,3 (1859), 36-37. 78 Mackenzie, Ten Years, 40-41. 79 Mary Moffat, 15 Oct 1857, UCT BCZA 80/89. 80 Moffat, 14 May 1858, CWM SAI 31/1/A. 81 17 Aug 1857, in Wallis, ed., Matabele Journals, 2: 30-31. 87 As described in HMB 7, 8 (1860), 117-18 and HMB 7, 12 (1860), 179-82, the missionaries questioned HMS demands that they should devote most of their time to preaching and teaching.

When Paulo died in 1873 at Molepolole, the respect that he had earned during his life was a product not simply of his missionary ties but of his ability to transcend the frontier between African and European.84 Conclusion By the time of Paulo's death, Tswana communities were experiencing a dramatic transformation, and the relative autonomy enjoyed by the first generation of Tswana converts and evangelists was ending. Eastern Tswana had largely fallen under the control of Boer states during mid-century, dispossessed of their land and obliged to seek wage labor. Western Tswana were in the process of succumbing to British industrial and imperial designs. This expansion of European influence also affected Tswana Christianity, as the mission enterprise became much more structured and controlled by Europeans, in concordance with the goals and methods of colonization. Tswana evangelists and congregations soon moved out of the central dikgotla (courtyards) of Tswana rulers and into schools and churches constructed by missionaries. Nevertheless, the foundations of Tswana Christianity had already been laid by Paulo and other early converts, differentiating between the frontier of Christianity and the colonial frontier. Tswana Christians during the colonial era would have strong grounds for claiming the faith as their own and questioning European dictates. For the most part, missionaries had little control over early African appropriation of Christianity, and if Tswana Christians followed their direction, it was out of respect for a particular missionary's expertise and generosity and not out of necessity. This led converts to adopt a mix of behaviors and fashions that struck some European observers as evidence of conversion and others as shallow posturing. When the explorer Gustav Fritsch visited Paulo's congregation at Moshupa in 1865, he judged those in attendance at Sunday worship to be embracing only a semblance of European Christianity without its substance, and that genuine conversion could not take place without the gradual decline of African societies. However, if Fritsch had been able to comprehend Paulo's preaching, it seems likely that he also would have found evidence of Christianity's translatability, exemplified by the success of the "father of darkness" in his career as an itinerant evangelist, diplomat, and trader, emulating the work of his baptismal namesake, the biblical Paul, to make Christianity meaningful in multiple cultures and communities. The case of Paulo Rrafifing Moiefane thus provides a window into African European relations in the interior of southern Africa during the mid-nineteenth century. Although there are limits to how much can be extrapolated from the life of one person, in the fluid situation of early Tswana-European encounters, there was considerable opportunity for individuals to reinvent themselves and pursue novel objectives. African European relations during the mid-nineteenth century were marked more by personal ambition, innovative hybridity, and compromise than an epic "clash of civilizations," and rather than define their lives primarily in terms of their relations with Europeans, Africans were usually more concerned with affairs within their own families and communities over 84 Paulo's death is reported in Williams, 16 Dec. 1873, CWM SAR 1/8.</page><page sequence="20">120 Stephen Volz which they felt some measure of control and responsibility. Tswana appropriation of Christianity did not constitute an unconscious submission to European control but rather a deliberate attempt to reconcile old and new ideas in service to Tswana rulers. Though perhaps difficult to discern through the polarizing lenses of later colonial rule and African nationalism, the primary discourse of nineteenth-century Tswana Christianity was authored not by European missionaries as a rationale for colonization but by Tswana evangelists, accommodated on their own terms and centered in the families, wagons, and courtyards of Tswana communities.</page></plain_text>
