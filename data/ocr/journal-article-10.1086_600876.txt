      <p>At the end of his 1825 theological opus, <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge promised “a small supplementary Volume” containing disquisitions on the Eucharist, faith, and “the philosophy of Prayer.”1 Although he did not make good on the promise, the essays can to some extent be reconstituted from scattered material such as marginalia and notebooks. Of these unfinished works, a philosophy of prayer was among the most imperative and yet difficult, for at stake was an overcoming of pantheism and the recovery of a personal God from the metaphysical absolute theorized by German idealism. Exactly how crucial it was can be seen from his comments in <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic>: “If you have resolved that all belief of a divine Comforter present to our inmost Being and aiding our infirmities, is fond and fanatical … in what better light can Prayer appear to you, than the groans of a wounded Lion in his solitary Den … ? Do not pre‐judge a Doctrine, the utter rejection of which must oppose a formidable obstacle to your acceptance of Christianity itself.”2 In fact, prayer is arguably just as important to the late Coleridge as his much better‐known theories of the church and state. While classic studies of Coleridge’s thought—such as those by John Muirhead, James Boulger, and J. Robert Barth—have covered the topic of prayer before, as part of general accounts of his sprawling theology and metaphysics, I believe that the texts are worth revisiting in more concentrated detail, for three important reasons.3</p>
      <p>First, from the perspective of Coleridge studies, prayer—as noted above—is an important yet overlooked topic that is treated, if at all, from an overwhelmingly synchronic perspective, alongside other aspects of Coleridge’s thought rather than within a tradition of thinking on prayer specifically. This is despite prayer playing critical roles in some of his most famous poetry and acting as the focus for much of his intellectual energy in his late career. Emphasizing the diachronic leads to our second reason, which is that Coleridge was placed pivotally across a romantic watershed in theology: after Kant, the higher criticism, and the collapse of the religion of natural reason, and at a moment when religious subjectivity was being reconceptualized by contemporaries like Friedrich Schleiermacher. Coleridge’s reflections can be analyzed within this context as marking a new way in which prayer was to be understood in relation to faith, knowledge, and rationality. As such, an important part of my argument below shall be to compare Coleridge with Kant, Kierkegaard, and others, proving that he stands at an important crux in the historical perception of prayer and faith itself. Finally, an investigation of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer is all the more pertinent given renewed interest in the phenomenology and language of prayer within recent Continental philosophy and literary theory, accounts to which I shall return at the end of this article. The possibility of prayer—as a performative directed to an absolute Other—continues to engage a contemporary philosophical fascination with the limits of both language and subjectivity, limits that are in no small part related to the philosophical legacies of Kantianism, romanticism, and early nineteenth‐century theology.</p>
      <p>In order to keep prayer itself in the foreground, my initial exposition will explain Coleridge’s positions on the possibility, necessity, and efficacy of prayer. All three rest on a primordial relation to God (a “being‐for‐God,” as I shall term it) that constitutes our proper selfhood and that impresses a claim and a call upon the “I.” However, awareness of this fundamental relationship has been lost through sin, leading to the occlusion or abandonment of the call. Coleridge defines prayer as a necessary act, aiming to recover this most authentic meaning by, quite literally, holding oneself for‐God in the act of praying to‐God. He thus returns the personal relationship with God that Kant had defined as something intellectually dubious in <italic>Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone</italic> to the very heart of how to understand the human subject. Yet in doing so he turns that subject against itself, driven to affirm what it cannot understand (i.e., God and a personal relation to him) in order to understand itself. As such, Coleridge anticipates Kierkegaard by making faith paradoxical, with Mark 9:24—“I believe, Lord! Help thou mine unbelief”—the archetypal prayer. This article concludes by bringing Coleridge into dialogue with Jean‐Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida, whose relatively recent debate centered on whether there can be a suitable language of prayer. Coleridge’s position on religious language as catachresis, when joined with his more general analysis and the prominence of Mark 9:24, offers the possibility of conceiving prayer’s language as both improper and yet nevertheless appropriate in being improper. This is because human language is indeed improper in purporting to hail and name God, and thus prayer must work against the grain of tenable meaning, courting paradox and even impiety as it does so. This was something to which Coleridge, always attentive to the internal struggles constitutive of the experience of prayer and, of course, to the texture and experience of language, was incisively attuned.</p>

         <title>Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer</title>
         <p>Although it is my intention to focus on prayer rather than to position prayer within an account of Coleridge’s theology, it is important to start from the theological commitment that gives rise to “the necessity of Prayer.”4 A notebook entry of July 1827 provides the core of precisely this commitment: “This is the Corner‐stone of <italic>my</italic> System, ethical, metaphysical and theological—the priority, namely, both in dignity and order of generation, of the Conscience to the Consciousness in Man. No I without a Thou: no Thou without a Law from <sc>him</sc>, to whom I and Thou stand in the same relation” (N5556, fols. 40v–41). Coleridge’s insistence that conscience is logically and phenomenologically prior to consciousness means that the “I” is always constituted by a sense of responsibility that hangs over its acts to other subjects around it.5 With a Buberian or Levinasian twist on the Kantian transcendental ego—“Self is Definition, but all Boundary implies Neighbourhood” (N3231, fol. 14)—one is always already a moral being, prior to the “I” as a locus of perceiving and thinking.6 However, the I‐Thou relation demands the presence of an imperative claim from a kind of “third,” and, crucially, this third is personal. Because Coleridge construes responsibility as occurring only between subjects or wills (not between a subject and a thing), the absoluteness of the moral law must represent a relation to an absolute will. God must be asserted as a personal Being, not merely as a “transcendent Abstract” (N6666, fol. 83). As such, Coleridge frequently bemoans theological thinking that “[withdraws] from the Life and Personal Being of God … to the so called physical Attributes [e.g., omnipresence, immutability] … the attributes of space with a notion of Power as their Substratum! <sc>a fate</sc>, in short, not a Moral Creator and Governor!”7</p>
         <p>The primordiality of our moral being thus implies an even more primordial religious being: a sense of responsibility toward a living God, which “constitutes me a Man” (N5339, fol. 36). Hence, Coleridge’s definition of a religion in June 1827 as “the Reference <italic>of</italic> an intelligent <italic>responsible</italic> Will Finite to an <sc>absolute will</sc>!—and the Referent must refer as a <sc>will</sc>, and a Life, i.e. a Person, to a living <sc>i am</sc>. We may feel <italic>from</italic>, and about a thing, an event, a quality … but we feel <italic>toward</italic> a Person only.—The Personal in me is the ground and condition of Religion and the Personal alone is the Object” (N5530, fols. 65r–v). With the personal established as the ground, condition, and object of religion, prayer becomes possible, since the “appellability of God” (N6666, fol. 83) is implied in the fact of his personal being. However, prayer is not just possible in Coleridge’s scheme, it is necessary. This necessity is grounded in a foundational postulate mentioned alongside conscience and responsibility in the <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic>: “The existence of <sc>evil</sc> … essentially such, not by accident of outward circumstances, not derived from its physical consequences, nor from any cause, out of itself … a Fact of History.”8 Asserted as “a Fact, which we see, but cannot explain” in discussions of original sin within <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic> and treated with forbidding complexity as the consequence of the finite’s self‐determination as separate from the absolute ground in later speculations, it is a datum of Coleridge’s thought that the finite will always falls short of the responsibility it bears to God.9</p>
         <p>This falling short—described in 1826 as “the <italic>chasm</italic>—or apostasy, or the self‐position of the <italic>Finite</italic>” (N5411, fol. 44v)—is something frequently attested in Coleridge’s records of his own prayers. Thus, in 1808, his heart during prayer is “dead‐alive, yet trembles ceaselessly” (N3353). In 1825, he recalled that “even in boyhood there was a cold hollow spot, an aching in that heart, when I said my prayers—that prevented my entire union with God—that I could not <italic>give up</italic>” (N5275). Yet if violation of one’s responsibility before God is a common theme of prayer, prayer is also one of the few conceivable and valid responses to this disastrous disjunction between the human and divine wills. It is precisely because we fall short that we have to pray: as Coleridge puts it in 1830, prayer is “the effort to connect the misery of Self with the blessedness of God—&amp; it’s [<italic>sic</italic>] voice is—Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v).</p>
         <p>The rationale for prayer as a responsive and responsible act in the breach of violated fidelity to God can be found in simple form as early as 1810. In a notebook entry, Coleridge wondered how “imperfect and enslaved man” could ever fulfill the resolutions and dictates of conscience. He notes that the “Mere knowledge of the right, we find by experience, does not suffice to ensure the performance of the Right—for mankind in general. How indeed should it, if mankind … are sick &amp; weak in their moral Being.” The answer is to find “the medium between mere conviction &amp; resolve, &amp; suitable <italic>action</italic>. … Such a medium is absolutely necessary, since there is no saltus in nature—This medium is found in Prayer, &amp; religious Intercommunion between Man &amp; his Maker” (N4017). If action always fails to follow moral resolve, prayer lies somehow between act and resolution. A medial function also features in Coleridge’s mature reflections on the topic, as with a note of July 1827 that seeks “some state of Being, in which the productive energy is the produce, where the agent is in the same moment and the self‐same Act the patient &amp; wrestling conquers for himself what is yet bestowed on him of free grace. Now this is the Idea of Prayer; and in Prayer alone can the reality of the Idea be found” (N5554, fol. 12v). The terms are more complex than in 1810. Here, the idea of responsibility is intertwined with response: what is at stake is an individual will countersigning the divine will while remaining individual. Responsibility to God’s will means, in effect, fulfilling God’s claim on us, but freely, so that “the Act and Will of the Divine Spirit … may nevertheless be rightly named the Act and Will of the Human Recipient” (N5554, fol. 10v). Nevertheless, despite the different terms, the same mediating function is apparent: prayer joins the human will with the divine command.</p>
         <p>Prayer, then, is a space of fidelity in the midst of apostasy, allowing a ligature to somehow cross the “chasm” (N5411) opened by human fallenness. Yet how does prayer manage to achieve this? The singular type of act represented by prayer can be most clearly identified in Coleridge’s annotations to the Book of Common Prayer: “Prayer <italic>is Faith</italic> passing into act—a union of the will and the Intellect realizing in an <italic>intellectual act</italic>. It is the <italic>whole</italic> man that prays; less than this is wishing, or <italic>lip</italic> work, a charm, or a mummery. Pray always:—says the Apostle—i.e. have the habit of prayer, turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them by an act with the idea of the Redeemer God, and even so [reconverting] actions <italic>into thoughts</italic>.”10 Human acts are, in Coleridge’s scheme, always already unfaithful: a fact asserted through the invocation of original sin as undeniable intuition in <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic> or in later speculations about the ontology of finitude. However, there is one act that seems to resist this apostasy: the act of thinking and bearing one’s responsibility before “the Redeemer God.” Even if our every self‐determined act is corrupted by “powers within us &amp; without us ready to usurp the throne of Conscience” (“Essay on Faith”), the act of thinking oneself before God and for‐God is different, with a singular logical and intentional structure.11 It is self‐determination to be determined by the Other. It is both free and in accord with the divine law, for which we are by definition beings‐for‐God: “We truly <italic>are</italic>, only as far as God is with us. … We [cannot] truly <italic>possess</italic> (i.e. enjoy) our Being or any other real Good, but by living in the sense of his holy presence.”12 This, then, is the act of prayer: the act of thinking one’s being‐for‐and‐before‐God.13 As Coleridge writes in his “Nightly Prayer” (1830): “To Thee … who now beholdest me, who hearest me, who hast framed my heart to seek &amp; to trust in thee, in the name of my Lord &amp; Saviour Christ Jesus, I humbly commit and commend my Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit!”14</p>
         <p>Through this notion of being‐for‐God, we can see more clearly how prayer functions in the above notebook entries. In 1810, Coleridge had argued that prayer mediated between conscience and action: this makes sense, as prayer attests and bears witness to one’s sense of responsibility to God. It is the act of recognizing the demand of conscience and answering it, even if the only human answer that is truly faithful and appropriate sometimes seems to be guilt itself, tangled in its very attitude toward the promise of grace: “Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v). In 1827, the terms in question are those of activity and passivity: how can the human will bend itself into accord with the divine will? The answer is that the “I” must wrestle with the narcissism of its own being in order to attest to its being‐for‐God. In prayer, the human subject can be both “agent” and “patient”—that is, one who acts freely as a self but through this very act recognizes and accepts the self as for another, even as a gift from that other. Hence, this is the heart of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer: being for and before God, “turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them by an act with the idea of the Redeemer God.” In prayer, a phenomenological intentionality directed solely toward our sense of responsibility—“a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155)—can at least help orientate our being before and for God. This is why Coleridge can assert that in prayer alone is the life or will united with the idea of God (e.g., N5228, N5383) and why it can be a way out of the gnarled condition of sin. If one at least acknowledges one’s being‐for‐God, even if only in contemplating one’s abandonment of it in all other acts and intentionalities, then the economy of Christian salvation can be initiated: “O for the <italic>power</italic> to cry out for mercy from the inmost / That would be Redemption!” (N3353).</p>
         <p>There is one further element crucial to an exposition of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer, and that is efficacy. In the wake of the first edition of <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic>, whether prayer actually led to anything other than “some supposed beneficial reaction of Praying on the Prayer’s own Mind” exercised him greatly.15 As he suggested in marginalia to Martin Luther, “If A − Prayer = 3, and A + Prayer = 3, Prayer = 0.”16 The problem is theologically perennial, invoked at the beginning of classic treatments of prayer, such as Augustine’s <italic>Commentary on the Lord’s Sermon on the Mount</italic> and chapter 20 of John Calvin’s <italic>Institutes of the Christian Religion</italic>. Petitioning to affect a being with omniscient foreknowledge and absolute rationality is by definition ludicrous: as Karl Barth puts it, “The mere concept of God is enough to establish an objection against prayer in so far as it seeks to be more than a devotional exercise … and tries to be a request uttered to God.”17 Barth, of course, has his own answers as to why God does answer prayer and is not an “immoveable idol.”18 Somewhat like Barth, Coleridge’s eventual answers to the potential nullity of prayer are rooted in the idea of the human “I” as a being‐for‐God.</p>
         <p>We may begin with querying what we should desire in our prayers. One answer comes in the fragment “On St Paul’s Definition of Faith,” where Coleridge carefully defines the object of faith as something other than mere happiness: “We erroneously imagine the blessedness of Heaven to consist in <italic>Happiness</italic>, i.e. in pleasures <italic>out</italic> of ourselves: whereas it consists in <italic>Holiness</italic>, not in what we shall <italic>have</italic> but in what we shall <italic>be</italic>. … This is the great delusion of the fleshly Fancy, that we make Heaven a Having instead of a Being.”19 This is a fundamental insight: what we should pray for is a state of being, which the same text defines precisely as a being‐for‐God: “As I <italic>am</italic> in my Father, even so ye <italic>are</italic> in me, that God may <italic>be</italic> all in all.”20 Being‐for‐God is our most authentic, constitutive identity, and that is what we should yearn for: “We affirm the Idea of the <italic>real</italic> self which is one with the Absolute Being, without reference to the <italic>apparent</italic> Self, by which we are divided from the absolute” (N5581, fol. 181v). As Coleridge writes in a note of 1827, “Man is by his constitution a <italic>religious</italic> creature,” and “the cultivation of the Religious Sense” is the “proper <italic>effect</italic>” of prayer (N5554, fol. 13v).</p>
         <p>We are, primordially, beings‐for‐God, even though this arche‐gift is occluded by sin. It is just a matter of recovering this being‐for‐God: as Douglas Hedley comments, <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic> is ultimately “about the bending back of the soul to God.”21 Yet, of course, prayer is precisely an act that (re)opens the for‐God in our being. This mirroring between prayer’s form and object allows Coleridge to argue that “the heart‐felt Prayer for Mercy is the commencement, the nascent quantity, of the Mercy, we are praying for.—For a will one with the Will of the Eternal <sc>i am</sc>, is the essence of <italic>Faith</italic>” (N6404). With similar logic, Coleridge notes that because the aim of the prayer “Thy kingdom come” is to bring human wills into accord with the divine and prayer is itself a phenomenological commitment to this, our prayers are “among the antecedent <italic>Conditions</italic>” (N6095) of the kingdom itself. In this sense, Calvin’s comment that “we dig up by prayer the treasures that were pointed out by the Lord’s gospel” is highly appropriate to Coleridge’s theory.22 Humanity “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v). We are always (already) fundamentally for‐God, but prayer is the way of digging up, or receiving, this gift: “Ask, and it shall be given you” (Matt. 7:7).23</p>
         <p>It is on this basis that Coleridge affirms special providence, but not in the sense of God’s being swayed to allow us to have certain things, “this or that particular petition … any single detached event or incident.” Instead, God’s effect is defined against “the <italic>whole Chain</italic> of the Events, Incidents, internal processes &amp; changes, &amp; external providences, of our Life” (N6474, fol. 9v)—that is, our whole being, the ultimate determination and horizon of which is God’s relation to it. This is why Coleridge claims on more than one occasion that the answer to the efficacy of prayer lies with the intuition of <italic>deitas diffusa</italic>, “the Godhead as present in and thro’ all things” (N5411, fol. 45).24 God is with us, for Coleridge, “present to our inmost Being”; it is simply a matter of letting him make his claim on us, as Coleridge affirms in marginalia to the Book of Common Prayer: “As God, he must be <italic>present entire</italic> in <italic>every</italic> creature; but he is said to <italic>dwell</italic> in the regenerate; to <italic>come</italic> to them who receive him by Faith in his <italic>name</italic>.”25 Once the presence and claim of God is acknowledged, the effect follows: “Prayer is a gift … that must be received in order to come into being.”26 Human prayer is always answered because our acts of prayer are in themselves acts of opening us up to receive, from God, our most authentic identities and meanings, authenticity that glimmers to us from the wounded root of our being: “O grant me the aid of thy Spirit, that I may with a deeper faith, a more enkindled Love bless thee, who thro’ thy Son has privileged me to call thee Abba Father!”27</p>

         <title>Prayer and the Improper: Kant, Coleridge, and Kierkegaard</title>
         <p>One historian of Christian thought, referring explicitly to Coleridge alongside Friedrich Schleiermacher, argues that “the Romantics did nothing less than inaugurate a revolution in Western consciousness which, among other things, launched a new era in theology.”28 Although Coleridge’s reflections on prayer were unpublished during his lifetime, they are involved in a watershed moment in the way that the religious subject is perceived.29 Unlike previous discussions of prayer by J. Robert Barth, Boulger, and Muirhead, therefore, I want to place Coleridge within the tradition of reflections on prayer and show why he might be important. To start this analysis, we may note something characteristic about the kind of prayer that is emblematic for Coleridge’s analysis. Typically, from the very first patristic treatises, it has been the Lord’s Prayer that is central to the Christian understanding of the topic. The reflections of Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Luther, and Calvin all center on Matt. 6:9–13. Indeed, the Reformers saw prayer as a duty determined and expressed by the particular petitions enumerated by the Lord’s Prayer, which teach us for what it is proper to pray. Thus, Luther claims that “all the prayers which could ever be devised are in the Lord’s prayer,” while Calvin argues that “all other prayers lie outside the law and are forbidden.”30</p>
         <p>Now, Coleridge certainly does mention the Lord’s Prayer (e.g., N5383, N5721, N6095). Yet an equally persistent scriptural motif is Mark 9:24: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” Thus, in 1808, Coleridge writes: “Now I feel the anguish of not feeling savingly the prayer—I believe! Lord help my unbelief” (N3353). In the mid‐1810s, once more he cites “the exceeding Difficulty, the absolute Necessity of prayer. … I believe! Lord! help my unbelief” (N4183). By the time of his more mature speculations, one might have thought this anguished topos had receded, only for it to recur decisively in an important note of March 1832. Having reiterated the themes already surveyed above—the responsibility to a personal God that constitutes us—he describes the difficulty of salvaging our proper moral being from the wreck of our apostate being: “Save me from the Disbelief of my fleshly Understanding!” (N6666, fol. 83). Predictably, a citation from Mark 9:24 follows. I am going to argue that the unusual prominence of Mark 9:24 can be attributed to a displacement in the concept of faith, a displacement identifiable by taking a detour through the work of Immanuel Kant.</p>
         <p>Coleridge was deeply influenced by Kant’s approach to Christianity as a fundamentally moral rather than theoretical entity. Yet, equally, Coleridge reacted against much in Kant’s theology.31 Chief among his objections in this context is the way that Kant makes God little more than a reflex of the moral law. In <italic>Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone</italic>, Kant had argued that “the doctrine of virtue … subsists of itself (even without the concept of God)” and that “when reverence for God is put first, with virtue therefore subordinated to it, this object … becomes an <italic>idol</italic>.”32 In his desire to assert this priority and to disassociate religion from cultic observance and ceremony, Kant hollowed out much of religious practice. Included in his purification of religious concepts is prayer, which figures a valid moral intention (the so‐called pure spirit of prayer) but is improper in purporting to address God: “In the heart‐felt wish which is the spirit of prayer, man seeks but to work upon himself. … A prayer can be offered with perfect sincerity even though the man praying does not presume to be able to affirm that the existence of God is wholly certain. … As <italic>an address</italic>, he supposes this Supreme Being to be present in person … hence such complete sincerity cannot be found in the latter.”33 At best, prayer can function as a propaedeutic, quickening our desire to fulfill the moral law, with the aim that “the letter of it … [will] finally fall away.”34 At worst, it appears as the solitary indulgence in a fiction, as when Kant imagines a praying man “whom some one else takes unawares. … Everyone will … without my saying so, expect a man thus surprised to fall into confusion or embarrassment … because a man caught talking aloud to himself is suspected of having a slight attack of madness.”35 Prayer is thus relegated to an improper margin, both philosophically and indeed textually, existing within a supplementary “General Observation” covering prayer, churchgoing, baptism, and communion. These four, in turn, join a quartet of <italic>parerga</italic> alongside grace, miracles, and mysteries: notions that “do not belong within it [rational religion] but border upon it.”36</p>
         <p>Kant's entire theological project can be read as the setting off of these parerga from the moral core of religion. By contrast, what Coleridge does is return the parerga to the very heart of the subject’s experience: in a sense, he deconstructs, according to the logic of the Derridean supplement, the <italic>ergon</italic> (work) and the <italic>parergon</italic> (border) of Kant’s religion of reason. For instance, Kant’s moral law stood alone: a moral lawgiver could be inferred, but this inference added very little in justifiable knowledge. Essentially, God became a hypothetical reflex of the moral law, and his nature and even existence was, apart from this context, inscrutable.37 Conversely, for Coleridge, responsibility to the moral law is irreducibly personal, and a sense of a personal God is fundamental for responsibility to exist at all. As he writes in the 1825 edition of <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic>, religion is “the hidden Spring and Fountain‐head of all true Morality,” and it is “impossible to separate the Moral from the Religious.”38 A similar reversal occurs with grace. Kant assented that humanity should be able to fulfill the moral law, and yet radical evil meant that they could not. As such, grace is inevitably inscribed as a hope in our moral experience, but one that Kant reduced to a parergon, “wholly transcendent … salutary to hold … at a respectful distance.”39 On the other hand, as our initial discussion made clear, humanity’s need for redemption is utterly fundamental to Coleridge: grace is a solecism for the former but the very heart of moral experience for the latter. From what has already been said, the same pattern very clearly applies to prayer: a parergon for Kant, one of the highest necessities of human experience for Coleridge.</p>
         <p>The interesting thing is that Coleridge accepts much of the Kantian analysis: these concepts, such as a personal God, grace, and the possibility of prayer, are indeed improper to reason, but they are returned as improper to the very heart of the human subject. Thus, Coleridge writes that “only a negative rationality can be demanded” (N5383) of prayer. Prayer involves “contradictions <italic>in terms</italic>, I grant you: never the less so it is! … Were it not a contradiction <italic>in terms</italic>, it would not be an <italic>Idea</italic> … but either a Fact of the Sense or the Conception of the Understanding! … Spiritual things can only be spiritually discerned. … It is impossible, you say—Yea, I reply: but nevertheless such is the truth” (N5554, fols. 12v–13). Both Kant and Coleridge recognize that parerga possess a certain phenomenological irreducibility: they do seem to force themselves to be thought, even if they are strictly unthinkable. Yet where the former privileges philosophy’s right to exclude unthinkable concepts, the latter bears witness to the necessity of these same concepts. In Coleridge’s work, the human subject must act, at its very center, on and across the limit of what it can justifiably think and know: “The more I read &amp; reflect on the arguments of the truly philosophical Theists &amp; Atheists, the more I feel convinced that the ultimate difference is a moral rather than intellectual one / that the result is an X Y Z—an acknowledged Insufficiency of the Known to account for itself, and therefore a something Unknown—but to which the Theist dedicates his noblest feelings of Love, &amp; Awe, &amp; by a moral syllogism connects &amp; unites it with his Conscience &amp; Actions—while the Atheist leaves it a blank in the Heart, because it is a Blank in his Understanding” (N4030).</p>
         <p>We can now see the force of Mark 9:24. Coleridge’s religious beliefs have crossed the Kantian analysis and yet ended up affirming faith nonetheless, bringing what is supposedly improper and parergonal right back to the heart of the work, or ergon, of the human subject.40 The praying subject, like every aspect of the religious subject, faces paradoxes that are nevertheless apparently necessary to its being, which is why the paradoxical Mark 9:24 is exemplary. How do we possibly understand praying to a hidden God who lies outside the bounds of our reason? Being‐for‐God is not something that can be justifiably affirmed by a finite “I” that can only understand itself as a self‐determined individual in the world: hence Coleridge’s comment in 1808 that “the <italic>habit</italic> of psychological Analysis makes additionally difficult the act of true Prayer” (N3355). Yet we also feel the necessity of the claim on our being to be for‐God, a claim Coleridge believes to be irreducible. As such, prayer sets the being of the “I” against itself, trying to attest to something “deeper than our Consciousness can reach. … What we cannot <italic>imagine</italic>, we cannot, in the proper sense of the word, conceive.”41</p>
         <p>In affirming “negative rationality” (N5383) at the center of the human subject, Coleridge joins a tradition of asserting theological mysteries (e.g., Tertullian, Blaise Pascal) but also creates a displacement in the traditional concepts of faith and prayer to make the paradoxical cry of Mark 9:24 archetypal. Even when writing about the Lord’s Prayer, his reflections tend to bear its trace. In 1831, for instance, he describes himself as “a paralytic but yet a living Nerve” in Christ’s body and begs “thy Will be <italic>done</italic>: Let but the vital warmth of thy redemptive Love pierce to me” (N6621). The prayer thus translates the petition into a version of Mark 9:24, willing for one’s will to be broken, willing against oneself. The form is characteristic of most of Coleridge’s citations of Matt. 6:10 (see N5516, N5634, N6474). While such an interpretation is not foreign to the great Protestant theologians, it is only one element of their readings: for Coleridge, it appears dominant.42 In foregrounding this strange, paradoxical tenor, he looks forward to Søren Kierkegaard, the most notable theologian of paradoxical faith, who would deepen Coleridge’s assertion of an existentialist religious act: “A Faith with a Belief indeed, but with a belief that derives it’s [<italic>sic</italic>] origin &amp; stability wholly from the Antecedent Faith” (N6666, fol. 85).43</p>
         <p>Indeed, the Dane’s reflections on prayer are not dissimilar to Coleridge’s. In Kierkegaard’s <italic>Upbuilding Discourses</italic> (1843–44), he describes an aporia: “If a person yields completely in prayer, he does not struggle, but if he does not yield himself at all, then he is not praying.”44 This knot of activity and yielding echoes Coleridge’s comments in N5554, as well as what the English writer called, in 1826, the “twofold Ground of Prayer”: “Perfect resignation to the Divine Will” set against “impassioned obstinacy and petitionary vehemence” (N5411, fol. 44v). As in Coleridge’s account, Kierkegaard’s theory cuts this aporia by making the self against itself the very core of prayer. In the analysis made in <italic>Upbuilding Discourses</italic>, one’s struggles and petitions reach a concentrated point, which leads to renunciation. In the moment that one abandons the petitionary desire that had impelled the praying “I,” one suddenly realizes one’s prayers have been answered: “Only when he himself becomes nothing, only then can God illuminate him so that he resembles God.”45</p>
         <p>By making the victory against oneself the victory of prayer, Kierkegaard mirrors Coleridge in suggesting that the proper effect of prayer is a state of being founded on an unthinkable risk: explanation (<italic>forklaring</italic>) is never forthcoming from God, but transfiguration (<italic>forklarelse</italic>) is. He concludes by stating that an absolute debt to God, contrary to worldly logic, is actually an absolute honor, in a way not incompatible with Coleridge’s analysis of blessedness as a kind of being rather than having: the realization that yielding the finite self is a form of victory in that the precant “conquers for himself what is yet bestowed on him” (N5554, fol. 12v). Both thinkers, therefore, orientate prayer around a struggle with and passage through paradox. As such, they are of their historical moment. For a long time, one might argue, faith had been one of the most proper acts in Western culture: in the wake of the collapse of the so‐called religion of reason and the onset of modernity, it would become increasingly improper. With Matthew Arnold’s long, withdrawing roar and Nietzsche’s death of God on the horizon, a horizon already traced by Kant’s <italic>Religion within the Limits of Mere Reason</italic>, facing this impropriety would be one of the great tasks of modern religious thought.</p>

         <title>Improper Language: Catachresis and Prayer</title>
         <p>One of the most specific of Coleridge’s uses of Mark 9:24 and its improper logic is a note circa 1814: “Connection of Prayer with Faith / of the transcendency of religious Intuitions over Language, which only by balancing of contradictions can represent or rather re suggest them / ex. gr. I believe! Lord! help my unbelief” (N4183). Here, the struggle against oneself is determined linguistically, for speech concerning “Spiritual things, above all of the Divine Spirit, must needs be <italic>catachrestic</italic>” (N5411, fol. 44v). Catachresis—the misuse or even the perversion—of words becomes the improper heart of religious language, and intuitions central to Coleridge’s experience of prayer are necessarily expressed through it. Thus, for instance, the aforementioned trope of <italic>deitas diffusa</italic> is justifiable even though it is inscribed within a pantheistic logic that signifies precisely the opposite of the intended, Christian meaning. Only with an awareness of this catachresis—“the balancing of contradictions”—can the religious meaning unfold: “The depth of the Mystery is behind the Veil in the Vision of God vouchsafed to Moses—Even he, could only be allowed to behold the <italic>back parts</italic>, the skirts of the Deity—i.e. the Godhead as present in and thro’ all things, the ubiquity, not God as to whom all things are present, the supermundane Personal God … the God, <italic>in</italic> whom all things are present” (N5411, fol. 45). In the same note, the “twofold Ground of Prayer” is also referred to as the illogic of catachresis, thus paradoxically juxtaposing petitionary violence—“stir[ring] up &lt;God&gt; with prayer … language that seems to border on irreverence”—with submission and thanksgiving. Even the intercession of the Holy Spirit can only be enunciated through improper language, as Rom. 8:26 is unfolded into multiple oxymorons: “The Spirit pleadeth to Spirit with groans unutterable.” As Coleridge writes, “If as in this instance the interests of faith and piety justify us speaking at all, offence ought not to be taken at such phrases” (N5411, fol. 44v).</p>
         <p>In making the language of prayer catachrestic, he is once more reinscribing a theme from the tradition, but more forcefully and centrally than his predecessors. Calvin had written, “God tolerates even our stammering and pardons our ignorance … as indeed without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray.”46 Yet, classically, if there had been an epistemological problem in prayer, it was not about humanity’s knowledge of God (“the transcendency of religious Intuitions”) but rather about God’s knowledge of humanity: why pray, if God already knows what you are going to tell him? Equally, the focus on the Lord’s Prayer tended to mean that the language of prayer was a priori appropriate, even if Luther noted that its initial petitions were “Hebraically expressed,” that is, concerning spiritual mysteries.47 However, catachresis is in keeping with the tenor of Coleridge’s thought: the “I” against itself, the limit of human reason against itself, unbelief against itself, language against itself.</p>
         <p>Despite the evidence marshaled above, the proposition that language works against itself in prayer, stressed to the breaking point by a crisis of referentiality, may still provoke understandable resistance given Coleridge’s sacramental investment in language via the Logos elsewhere (e.g., in <italic>Biographia Literaria</italic>). However, it is a proposition that makes sense if we remember that prayer is fundamentally an act of response made from the condition of human fallenness. The <italic>Opus Maximum</italic> is helpful here, depicting a complex but suggestive relationship to Logos. One of its ongoing concerns is to clarify the divine origin of reason (a theme tellingly introduced for the first time via an analogy with language).48 Reason in its objective aspect is Logos and fully divine. However, reason in its subjective aspect, as belonging to individuals, is best described as a flawed “act of self‐direction … <italic>of opening and of receiving</italic>, which may … exist in very different degrees … <italic>counteracted or suspended or even suppressed</italic>” (emphases mine).49 Reason is the Johannine light that “lighteth every man” (John 1:9), offered by God, but human reason is the eye opened imperfectly to that light. Insofar as humanity shares in or responds to the Logos, it does so only in a flawed way that must betray the separation between human and divine wills: “Reason is the presence of God to the &lt;Human&gt; Will independent of its unity with the divine Will. … A Reason that did not contain itself a power of opposing a Reason, or of not being one with it, would be no Reason at all.”50</p>
         <p>This passage establishes a pattern that I feel can clarify Coleridge’s handling of the language of prayer. It is one also familiar in its structure from our torn relationship to the moral law: we are constituted as responsible wills because of our relationship to God, but our violation of the law means that we are fallen and finite, necessarily separate from God’s will. Similarly, according to the <italic>Opus</italic>, we are constituted as rational beings by the light of reason given to us by God, but we possess individual, finite rationality precisely because we are necessarily separate from God’s reason. Now, Coleridge definitely believed language was imbued with Logos and even lent it a divine origin given that it, like morality and rationality, marks us off from the animals: “The very conditions and materials of convention, a society of communicants, presupposes a language. … [It is] inconceivable that language should have been given to a mind that did not contain in itself the grounds and principles of language.”51 However, just as our fallen individuality demands a necessary separation from God’s will and God’s reason, our speech would logically mark the same separation. When speaking of God or trying to orient ourselves to God, it is not surprising that human language fails to overcome its own determination by the fallen, alienated world from which it proximately springs—even if it may ultimately come from or reflect or echo the divine Word.</p>
         <p>Prayer is, after all, enunciated when our ability to respond and reply (existentially and ethically, as well as linguistically) is most at stake and most fearfully close to failure. If prayer is the performative utterance of faith, then faith ultimately demands the enunciation of a being‐for‐God that, by definition, we are not, and hence one we struggle to articulate with the language at hand. And if the essence of the religious is “the reverence of the invisible,” then prayer is caught up in the visible order of the understanding that marks the human separation from God: “Words force us to speak metaphorically … in the language of the <italic>eye</italic>” (N5411, fol. 44v).52 Attempts to articulate a relationship with the divine must be drawn out of human experience marked by a chasm of separation. As Coleridge comments in 1829, “I know indeed, that his ways are not our ways nor his Thoughts our Thoughts.” Yet the struggle against the limits of language must be made: “How can I love him, trust in him, call on him, <italic>but as a Man</italic>?” (N6155, emphasis mine).53 Thus, while Coleridge may indeed believe that language is as potentially sacramental as the moral law or reason, we should also remember the human subject’s intrinsic distance from all three. The finitude of the human subject grounds language in the world, meaning that articulating a response to a call breaking the borders of that world can be as difficult as willing the response in the first place.</p>
         <p>Coleridge’s concern with the language of prayer broaches issues fundamental to some of the most recent scholarly analyses of prayer, and a comparison can be helpful in both directions. In particular, I want to consider the dialogue between Jean‐Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida.54 The debate begins with Marion’s 1977 book, <italic>The Idol and Distance</italic>, in which a negative theological premise initiates the query, “What language can be suitable to distance?”55 He resolves that, given that divine gifts cross this distance, the language must be praise, which “indicates the passage from discourse to prayer. … But how, in its turn, can prayer constitute a rigorous language that nevertheless remains in distance?”56 His answer is that prayer is not predication (thus remaining within the negative theological imperative of “distance”) but rather the expression of how God inheres in his relation to me, a formulation cited as “praise as (something).” Thus the connoisseur of beauty might praise God as beauty, or the lover might praise God as love, yet without claiming that such a relation is exhaustive or predicative.</p>
         <p>Now, Derrida holds that Marion has elided the distinction between praise and prayer, which represent two nominally separable traits. For Derrida, the only language that truly respects distance is, in a formulation that recalls Kant, pure prayer, or the “act of addressing oneself to the other as other.”57 However, praise, or encomium—even “praise as”—violates the purity of this first trait by compromising the absolute alterity of the Other and bringing reference to bear across address. Thus, “the encomium qualifies God, and <italic>determines</italic> prayer, <italic>determines</italic> the other.”58 Marion held that “praise as” did not attempt to qualify or determine God, but Derrida argues that it “entails a predicative aim, however foreign it may be the ‘normal’ ontological predication.”59 However, there is no real question of being able to pray without encomium, for “there would be no prayer … [without] writing, the code, repetition.”60 The letter of the prayer, as in Kant, is always impure: how do you address the Other without determining who the addressee is? True prayer is actually impossible. As Hent de Vries puts it, “Prayer is from the outset and forever divided in and against itself.”61</p>
         <p>I want to conclude by seeing how Coleridge’s thinking on prayer might, in being part of the reconceptualization of religious subjectivity found in the nineteenth century, anticipate some of the stakes and terms of Derrida and Marion’s debate. The most obvious thing to note is that Coleridge makes the against‐itself of prayer central. His thought echoes the lesson of Rom. 8:26—“We know not what we should pray for as we ought”—and the strange fold that means we pray for the capacity to pray. Calvin, no less, argues that prayer involves a “twofold pardon”—one for the original transgression and one for the weakness of the prayer.62 That is not to say that just declaring prayer paradoxical or catachrestic solves the problem (nor should it be taken for the terminal point of his own thinking), but it can help us further determine a distinctive Coleridgean position on the language of prayer. First, we should note that Derrida (like Kant) considers that prayer demands a certain purity of action in order to rigorously conform to its concept—in Derrida’s case, an act of pure address. By contrast, for Coleridge (like Marion and most thinkers in the theological tradition), we have seen that prayer is as much response as act, a position powerfully enunciated by Hans Urs von Balthasar’s view of prayer as hearing: “The better a man learns to pray, the more deeply he finds that all his stammering is only an answer to God’s speaking to him.”63</p>
         <p>This emphasis—for example, one “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v), and God as a “prior actuality” (N4816)—brings Coleridge far closer to Marion’s analysis than to Derrida’s, insofar as prayer responds to an always already present effect, claim, gift, or call. Marion presents prayer as language directed at a requisite (<italic>aition</italic>, or cause) from whom beings “receive themselves … as requestants.”64 This is why he later argues that Derrida’s objections hold only if naming God is seen as attempting to overcome a lack or deficiency in one’s intuition of God. Marion insists that the intuition is, by contrast, present as an excess—a saturated phenomenon—that demands a proliferation of names: father, love, beauty, holiness, and so on.65 Naming, in this infinitely multiplying sense, would thus be not a determination of God but a way of guarding against the illusion that any one name of God is determinative.66 Yet if prayer responds and bears witness to a certain call already made on the subject, Marion arguably renders prayer too easy. After all, it is only a minor shift from the human experience of loving to praising God as love.67</p>
         <p>For Coleridge, I have argued, answering God’s claim is always a struggle. Prayer is the phenomenological concentration on being‐for‐God, “a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155), as it is put in 1829. However, as we saw in the second section of this article (“Prayer and the Improper: Kant, Coleridge, and Kierkegaard”), such presence is, strictly speaking, unthinkable for the fallen “I.” As such, the thought of being‐for‐God is always cut against the grain of one’s being, will, and understanding. To respond, therefore, is to struggle with oneself, a struggle implicating one’s speech: prayer is also cut across the grain of language. As David Haney notes, there is a sense in which wordless prayer alone could be pure surrender.68 Derrida is correct insofar as all the codes and words of prayer bear traces of predication, which, for Coleridge, are fatally intertwined with the understanding of an “I” separate from God. As Luther suggests, prayer “is a constant violent action of the spirit as it is lifted up to God. … We must all practice violence.”69 Calling—replying—to God becomes a kind of violence practiced against oneself and one’s language, as is apparent in Coleridge’s description of God as an “Idea [that] worked in you, like the Memory of a Name which we cannot recollect and yet feel that we have, and which reveals its existence in the mind only by a restless anticipation and proves its prior actuality by the almost explosive instantaneity with which it is welcomed &amp; recognized on its re‐emersion” (N4816).</p>
         <p>I would like to conclude by noting that, of course, Coleridge’s poetry offers a particularly concrete representation of the struggles—linguistic, volitional, and existential—that surround the experience of prayer.70 The verbal paralysis that seizes the Ancient Mariner would be the most obvious and illustrious example:<disp-quote>
               <p>I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;But or ever a prayer had gusht,A wicked whisper came, and madeMy heart as dry as dust.(lines 244–47)</p>
            </disp-quote>While the Mariner does, of course, pass beyond this crisis of language, one must note that release occurs only after he is able to render a strange wordless and volitionless blessing, a kind of secret arche‐prayer that allows further ones to be made: “I blessed them unaware” (line 285). While I would hesitate to map the theory of later decades onto much earlier poems, this is nonetheless a fine representation of Coleridge’s enduring faith that even where “no tongue … may declare” (lines 282–83), something may also be happening, perhaps working wordlessly against language, to bring about being‐for‐God. Moreover, the same juxtaposition of a struggle to enunciate prayer with a corresponding imaginative turn to the wordless also features in many of Coleridge’s private lyrics. For instance, the sonnet “When they did greet me Father” expresses an inability to pray predicated on a lack of receptivity and response to the divine, evoking speech that cannot become speech and words that will not come: “Th’ unquiet silence of confused thought” (line 7). It is signifiers that mark the limits of language—tears and groans—that stand in for what cannot be uttered here and that conclude the poem. “The Pains of Sleep” also expresses a preference for wordless prayer—“No wish conceived, no thought exprest” (line 8)—but, in its latter stanzas, depicts a spiritual desolation that demands a more concrete form of utterance and appeal. Yet the speaker’s attempts to pray aloud are marked by “anguish and … agony” (line 14), and the precant’s voice, like his corrupted will, is alienated from itself: “My own loud scream / Had waked me from the fiendish dream” (line 37–38). These poems thus confirm a struggle for and through language and the haunting of prayerful speech by its inarticulate Others—“wicked whispers,” “unquiet silence,” tears, groans, screams.</p>
         <p>Even in poems that represent prayer in a less agonized light, acts of prayer are not necessarily straightforward. For instance, “Hymn before Sun‐Rise” concludes on a triumphant note, appearing to marry Kantian natural sublimity with a confident Christian prayer: “Tell the stars and tell yon rising sun, / Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God” (lines 84–85). Yet it is the landscape—anthropomorphized mountains, flowers, and streams—rather than the human being that utters this prayer. It is thus, paradoxically, a virtually mute nature that provides the language to and for the speaker. There is a not dissimilar dynamic in “To William Wordsworth,” another poem that seems to crown itself with prayer:<disp-quote>
               <p>I sate, my being blended in one thought(Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound—And when I rose, I found myself in prayer.(lines 109–12)</p>
            </disp-quote>Yet the speaker’s prayer here is constituted primarily as an after‐echo of Wordsworth’s recitation of <italic>The Prelude</italic> (which the poem describes); thus, just as in “Hymn before Sun‐Rise,” prayer occurs because the burden of enunciation has been displaced elsewhere—something also marked, I feel, by the uncertain relation of the prayer to the speaker’s volition: “I found myself in prayer.” Thus, these poems evoke successful prayer not because there is no struggle against language but precisely because another language, from elsewhere, has befallen the praying subject. While there is much more to say about the portrayal of prayer and praying in Coleridge’s poetry, even these brief readings provide compelling evidence that prayer—even fulfilled and fulfilling prayer—must pass through a certain agon.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In <italic>Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</italic>, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part of <italic>metastasis‐anastasis</italic> (change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71 Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.</p>
