This was expected to indicate degree of success in liberal arts training. Results in some cases led to curriculum changes, a fact that occasions these remarks. Faculty members were permitted to read the questions, but not make transcripts. In one hurried perusal, I made a mental count of these questions which were distinctly botanical or zoological, and those which could be properly called biological. Totals given below may not be precisely accurate, but are close enough for discussion. General Section (Total 65 questions on biology) Botany 8 Biology 19 Zoology 38 Special Section (Total 279 questions on biology) Botany 60 Biology 52 Zoology 167 In both groups, the number of zoological questions greatly exceeds that of botanical and biological questions combined. In the general section there are nearly five times as many zoological as botanical; in the special section nearly three times as many. Why this one-sided ratio? It can scarcely be justified in terms of importance to the general public. Agriculture, horticulture, conservation, and economic botany are hardly over- shadowed in a ratio of 5 to 1 by zoological subjects, even including medicine (which itself involves botanical matter in pathology and pharmacy). Neither can demands of students in pre-professional training justify the discrepancy. M. H. Trytten in 1949 (Science 109: 505-508) reported the total number of B.S. majors in U.S. schools in 1947-48 as 8,790 in all plant sciences, 2,182 in all animal sciences. Total graduate appoint- ments were 637 in botany (excluding agriculture, forestry, horti- culture, and pharmacology), 734 in zoology (excluding anatomy and entomology). A-I-B-S BULLETIN-April 1955</page><page sequence="2">Many can testify from personal experience that the Graduate Record Examination reflects actual teaching personnel and course offerings in many U.S. colleges. The personnel of the commit- tee which prepared the biology questions is illuminating. The five members include one each from a state college, a medical school, a teachers college, a state university, and a private uni- versity. Their professional interests as given in American Men of Science are: testing, educational psychology; physiological chemistry; zoology-cellular physiology, biophysics; economic bi- ology--mammalogy; entomology; botany; radiology-biological effects of radiation. The real roots lie deeper than committee personnel, or prevalence of unbalanced curriculums in present day colleges. These represent the consequences of developments which began in the last century. Population increase, rise of great urban centers, and shift of the U.S. from a predominately agri- cultural to a predominately industrial nation undoubtedly encouraged de-emphasis on plant sciences in teaching. Another influence has probably been more decisive. Of those college students interested in plant sciences, most will take degrees in agricultural colleges or forestry schools, which have arisen within the past 90 years. But there is not an equivalent selection of the largest single group interested in animal sciences; those planning to go into medicine. Consequently the so-called liberal arts colleges do not have a balanced sampling. The pre-medical students are a major pressure group, for whose benefit the curriculum has been increasingly modified. We now have colleges of pre-medicine, equivalent to colleges of agriculture, forestry schools, or teachers colleges. Liberal arts in any proper sense to many of them have ceased to be. As a measure and symptom of our time, the Graduate Record Examination is a faithful witness. As a gauge of the broad, impartial training which a liberal education is supposed to be, nothing could be falser. LLOYD H. SHINNERS, Director of Herbarium, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas. One copy of each publication submitted for listing should be sent to the Editor, The AIBS Bulletin, 2000 P Street, N. W., Washington 6, D. C. Only books published within a year of receipt will be reviewed. ANIMAL SCIENCES Dragonflies of North America. JAMES G. NEEDHAM and MINTER J. WESTFALL, JR. 615 pgs., 341 fig. University of California Press, Berkeley 4, Calif. (1955) $12.50. Entomologists, expert and amateur alike, will find this an indispensable manual if they are interested in the Odonata. The book is designed primarily for the identification of dragonflies but it is more than that. Dragonfly nymphs, often neglected in the past, are discussed, keys supplied and illustrations provided. Practical methods and implements for collecting, preserving, and studying dragonflies are included. The range of species is given in terms of states, rather than in terms of life zones. Through- out the book the language used is simple and clear and common names are supplied whenever possible. The authors have man- aged to lend to what might have been a highly technical volume a real appreciation of these insects in their natural habitats. World Outside My Door. OLIVE BOWN GOIN. 184 pgs. The Macmillan Company, 60 Fifth Ave., New York 11, N.Y. (1955) $3.50. The author is the biologist wife of a biologist at the Univer- sity of Florida. In her backyard on a hammock area at the outskirts of Gainesville, Mrs. Goin began to keep a journal about the creatures she observed. Gradually her casual observa- tions became close observations and this charming book tells the story. Written in a style that will be enjoyed by everyone, the book should be particularly appealing to those living in similar southern regions with the same species. However, it should inspire possessors of "backyards" everywhere to watch more carefully for the fascinating array of animals and birds that can inhabit one small piece of territory. Attractive cartoon- type drawings by Esther Coogle illustrate in a casual fashion. Evolution of the Vertebrates. EDWIN H. COLBERT. 479 pgs., 122 illus. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $8.95. Dr. Colbert is Curator of Fossil Reptiles and Amphibians at the American Museum of Natural History and Professor of Vertebrate Paleontology at Columbia University. The book is intended to be a general textbook on vertebrate paleontology; it is not meant for the specialist or the lay reader. The approach is via the fossil record. Principles of evolution are discussed or mentioned in passing but the book is not built around them. Neither is it concerned with the mechanisms of evolution as revealed by genetics. A feeling of the passing of geologic time is established by the author and maintained throughout. The text material is enhanced by a liberal supply of bone drawings, excellent restorations and phylogenies. The Mammalian Fetus: Physiological Aspects of Develop- ment. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Bi- ology, Vol. 19. 225 pgs., 202 fig., 5 pl. The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. (1955) $8.00 plus postage. The 19th annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposia, held June 7-14, 1954, brought together more than 125 American and European scientists to discuss the development and physiology of the mammalian fetus. The twenty-seven lectures presented by invited participants, and the discussions which followed them, are recorded in this volume. The meetings began with a consideration of early embryonic development, then took up a variety of integrated physiological activities necessary for the development of the fetus, and finally discussed the metabolic characteristics of the fetus as a whole and of its different parts. Bower Birds. A. J. MARSHALL. 208 pgs., 21 fig., 26 pI. Oxford University Press, 114 Fifth Avenue, New York 11, N.Y. (1954) $4.80. It has been known for over a century that the bower-birds, a family of passerines confined to Australia, New Guinea and nearby island, build display-grounds and decorate them in vari- ous fashions. Because of these extraordinary habits a large popular literature has grown up, much of it anthropomorphic, and most of it, according to Dr. Marshall, erroneous. Follow- ing a series of histo-physiological studies, and an examination of the ecology and literature of each species of bower-bird, the author writes that the display behavior is definitely connected with sexual reproduction, contrary to popular belief. The book is liberally illustrated and written in a style that should appeal to zoologists as well as ornithologists. Mosquitoes-Their Bionomics and Relation to Disease. WILLIAM R. HORSFALL. 723 pgs., 206 tables. The Ronald Press Company, 15 East 26th St., New York 10, N.Y. (1955) $16.00. Dr. Horsfall, Associate Professor of Entomology at the Uni- versity of Illinois, has provided research workers, sanitarians, epidemiologists, and ecologists with a complete summary of the bionomics of the subfamily of mosquitoes. General information on the subfamily as a whole and on each genus precedes the more detailed, systematic treatment of each species. Those con- cerned with the control of mosquitoes will find the most recent methods outlined for each species, as well as facts about toxinosis in the egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. A full dis- cussion is given to the role played by mosquitoes in spreading malaria, yellow fever, and other diseases. As well as outlining A.I.B.S BULLETIN--April 1955 13</page></plain_text>
