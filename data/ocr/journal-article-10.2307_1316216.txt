Designed for Delight: Alternative Aspects of Twentieth Century Dec- orative Arts MARTIN EIDELBERG (ed.). Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts/Flam- marion, 1997. 320 pp., 86 figs. (mainly colour) and 217 colour plates, cloth. ISBN 28013 595 3. This lavishly produced book has been issued in conjunction with a major travelling exhibition of the same title at the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts. The latter was established in 1979 as the first museum in Canada devoted entirely to the decorative arts, and the launching of both book and exhibi- tion reflects an institutional desire to enhance interest and scholarship in the decorative arts. The impetus for both emanated from Martin Eidel- berg who had advised on the museum's previous travelling exhibi- tion of 199i, entitled 'Design 1935- 1965'. However, as is stated in the preface to Designed for Delight, instead of organising a chronological sequel to this exhibition, the team pro- posed an exhibition which would explore a new direction for scholarship in twentieth century design. This path would reveal aspects of the century's aesthetic beyond the strictly Modernist tenets of functionalism and rationalism. There is a particular rationale which has been adopted here: the focusing onfin-de-siecle design of the late nine- teenth and late twentieth centuries, periods which might be characterized as pre-Modern and Post-Modem. Rather unsurprisingly, such an out- look apparently suggested to the organizers that the anti-rational and afunctional qualities of much work in these two periods was also to be found in the intervening years. As a result, the exhibition team sought to revisit the museum's collection of dec- orative arts throughout the twentieth century, reappraising more fulsomely those traits of progressive design which did not conform to the austere tenets of the Modernist project. Indeed, in his preface to the book it is claimed somewhat extravagantly by Luc d'Iberville-Moreau, the museum's Director, that the exhibition and text 'explore aspects of twentieth century decorative arts . . . that hitherto fell outside the traditional scholarship of modem design'. The key themes iden- tified include ornament, the use of the body as a key design element, an exploration of the element of surprise gained through the imaginative rede- ployment of standard forms, and uses of fantasy. What is most surprising to this reviewer is that such ideas are thought to reflect fresh thinking in the late 199os.

We hope that Designed for Delight will testify to this commitment and allow more people to partake of the pleasure we derive from these works. The book is beautifully produced with a large range of good-size colour plates. These include a cata- logue to the exhibition, where full details of each exhibit are laid out alongside often very well-chosen accompanying quotations by their makers, critics, historians and contem- poraries. Whilst many of the (more than 200) objects will be familiar to most historians of design and the dec- orative arts, there is also a rich diver- sity of fresh, surprising and visually arresting examples of decorative art executive in a variety of media drawn from the Montreal Museum of Dec- orative Art's excellent and expanding collection. Whilst the dustjacket's claim that the book Designed for Delight will 'become a standard refer- ence for decorative arts of the twenti- eth century' seems somewhat optimistic in the light of the broad- brush text, it is a well-produced and beautiful-looking volume with a wealth of inventive and visually attractive examples of twentieth-cen- tury decorative arts which will inspire many makers and call for prime space on the coffee-tables of the aesthetically charged.
