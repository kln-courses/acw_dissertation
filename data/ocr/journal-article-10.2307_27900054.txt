Mr. Ward claims that this "treatise on the conscious improvement of society by societyconstitutes with its predecessor Pure Sociology, a system of sociology, while those together with his earlier sociological works com pose a consistent and comprehensive system of social philosophy. The main implication of the entire system is "a true science of society, capable in the measure that it approaches completeness, of being turned to the profit of mankind_It aims to point out a remedy for the general paralysis that is creeping over the world, and which a too narrow conception of the law of cosmic evolution serves rather to increase than to diminish. It proclaims the efficacy of effort provided it is guided by intelligence." This particular portion of Mr. Ward's system of sociology is divided into three parts. The first part, "Movement," begins with a definitive chapter on the relation of pure to applied sociology followed by one on "The Efficacy of Effort," which proves the fallacy of the laissez faire school. Then the author treats of the "End or Purpose of Sociology," "Social Achievement,"</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES. 479 historic "World Views" and their interpretation, "Truth and Error," includ ing anthropomorphic views, and the "Social Appropriation of Truth." The second part on "Achievement" is devoted chiefly to a discussion of "Opportunity" and its logic, treating especially of different kinds of environ ment and their influence. The third part, "Improvement," after a chapter on the "Reconciliation of Achievement with Improvement," enters in more detail into the methods and problems of applied sociology. Appended to this work is a valuable bibliographical list of authors and titles of works, articles, and memoirs quoted or cited in the book with critical and explanatory notes, and references to the pages where the citations are made. A careful and thorough index completes the work.</page></plain_text>
