Liberato Santoro-Brienza. Irish Academic Press. 175 pp?1250pb 0-7165-2472-6. Present-day art lovers will stumble on very unfa miliar concepts the moment they open this book?which they are well-advised to do. That art has much or anything to do with beauty is almost heresy among critics nowadays, and ditto with craft, although the Greeks' aisthetikos and techne respectively yoke the pairs. Indeed tech nics and art are seen as antithetical a bare century after the Victorians tried so manfully to recouple them. Dr Santoro-Brienza, a UCD lecturer, starts by going deep into Aristotle, and eventually pur sues the theory of art through neo-platonism and Hegel to (quoting Debussy: 'The century of the aeroplane is entitled to its own music") structu ralism, avant-garde and semiotics, thus relating the classical tradition to where we are now. He then essays some 'critical explorations' of works, again spanning ancient and modern. One can for give an Italian for 'foreward' (in the preface) but less easily a publisher for 'Plonrinus' (blurb). * 4 ARCHITECTURE The Follies and Garden Buildings of Ireland. James Howley. Yale University Press. 259 pp (IR)?35 27 x 21 cm in slip case 0-300 05577-3. What could be more effete than the private architectural extravagances of the idle rich? Answer: an extravagant and beguiling book about them. So smartly was this spirited away for review that we had time only to flick through and note that a wealth of illustrations is supplemented by many plans and eleva tions, tnat sources are scrupulously given, that there is a detailed gazetteer appended as well as an index, and that the case binding looks like real cloth. * ## / BETWEEN ARCHITECTURE &amp; ART Telecom changed Gandon's new telephone num ber on them.

A mag nificent production consisting of Beckett's short but powerful homage from Les Lettres Nouvelles (1954) with an English translation, a 50-page appreciation of the artist (and writer) by the distinguished critic Rosenthal, well il lustrated with early drawings and other mate rial, 69 pages of colour plates and the same number again of monocnrome ones?exclu sively of oils, which means that the book on his watercolours and drawings, also reviewed in this issue, is largely complementary?both captioned only with title and year. Then?by Hfl lary Pyle?a chronology of the artist's life, a bibliography, lists of exhibitions from 1902 to 1991, ana detailed captions for all the plates, showing size and the exhibition and owner ship history of each painting, and references to it in books. The endpapers provide facsimi les of four issues of A Broad Sheet (1903). It must be said that many of the later oils do not reproduce very satisfactorily in monochrome to the layman s eye. We would have traded a lot of them for a few more in colour, but this is a fine and worthy book, and the typography is generous . 44 S Irish Arts Review yearbook 1994. ed. Alis tair Smith. Irish Arts Review. 272 pp ?19.95 pb A4 ISSN 0791-3540. 0-9513722-9-7 (hb ?29.95 -8-9). The remarkable annual, if possible even more magnificent than last year's, and per haps more academically interesting?for it is now firmly entrenched as the repository for art scholarship, tending towards the classical and to 'investors' art', but not exclusively Fine colour reproductions (and many fine adver tisements), and if we embarked on the con tents we'd keep you here all night. Where will it find sponsorship if, as is likely, GPA can't continue? Bless them for not bringing down the blinds this year, anyway. 4 * Onlookers in France : Irish realist and impressionist painters, ed. Julian Campbell. Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork. 36 pp NPGpb22 x24cm. Good colour reproductions of an interesting selection of paintings (and some drawings) by eighteen Irish artists who painted in France in this and the last century, with short notes on each. This records an exhi bition held in Cork last month . There are some predictables but some surprises for us too? Mary Swanzy, Sarah Cecilia Harrison, Joseph Stafford Gibson and Harry Scully for instance, and unfamiliar but brilliant works by Leech. The 'realists' with their stiffness, literal detail and tendency to muddy colours, are for us only tolerated for how they show what a thrilling, magical leap was made by the im pressionists. Very well designed by John CXRegan and printed by Betaprint. We would guess the price to be about ?10. 44 -* 50 Treasures from the Hunt Collection. Patrick K Doran. Hunt Museum, University of Limerick (distrib. Eason). 120 pp ?35 28 x 29 cm 0-9520922-0-4. John (d. 1976) and Gertrude Hunt, the latter now 90 years of age, authors of the Craggaunowen reconstruction of a pre-his toric settlement, built up a remarkable collection of objects of fine craftsmanship and curiosity from all periods and many parts of the world, notably artefacts of the Irish Bronze Age. It is in teresting that the collection owes more to their taste and interest in sometimes unfashionable periods and styles than to their wealth. They gave a considerable part of it to the nation, and it has been housed in the Hunt Gallery at the Uni versity of Limerick for fourteen years. Two years ago their two children donated many other pieces, and now theeighteenth-century Limerick Custom House is to be restored to hold and dis play the complete collection. In this handsome book the Dean of Humanities at Limerick briefly tells the story and introduces his selection of out standing pieces, and the Knight of Glin writes about the Custom House. The rest consists of ex cellent captioned colour photographs, mostly cut-outs, of objects ranging from a Renoir water colour sketch and a Jack B. Yeats oil to an egyp tian bronze of 2700 BC, the personal seal of Charles I and a Greek coin supposed to be one of the 'thirty pieces of silver'. It is grandiosely de signed by the GPA design department and very well printed in Limerick. * / AUTOBIOGRAPHY Just My Luck! John Curran. Inne, Dun Chaoin, Co Chiarrai. 92pp + 14ofphotos. 4.95pb 0-9522090-0-4. Johnny Curran is in his early fifties. In 1978, aged 36, over 6 foot and just 13 stone, with four children, he fell eight feet from a scaffold, severing his spinal cord, and was paralysed from his neck down. He had recently returned to his native Waterville, Co Kerry, after fourteen years in Britain. Now he has (in addition to his devoted wife Margaret and the children) an electric wheelchair and a computer, both chin-operated, and on the lat ter he has written this moving and compelling account of his life since the accident, with plenty of good photos from before and after. He is a Very ordinary'?and clearly very nice?man, and the book expresses his cheer ful, realistic faith and philosophy as well as recounting exactly what has happened to him and how he felt. We most strongly recom mend it as very readable and enjoyable?par ticularly perhaps to people facing handicap or who cannot imagine how they would cope in such circumstances (that's everyone). The nice cover says it all. We hope he earns enough from the book to get a clip-on telephone head set. + + -* * // Letters from Georgian Ireland: the cor respondence of Mary Delany 1731-68. ed. Angelique Day. hriar's Bush Press. 311 pp Stg?9.95 pb 24 x 16 cm 0-946872-56-2. The cased edition was enthusiastically reviewed by us in November last year: a graceful book that por trays society life in eighteenth-century Dublin and County Down through the correspon dence of an English lady who was a friend of Dean Swift and married into Delville, a coun try house in Clasnevin. Among other illustra tions arc fine colour plates of her paintings and shell work. The sewn paperback, in de cent format, is hardly less handsome than its cased version (C]7.S()) and would make a fine gift. +* ** *d / An Only Child. Frank O'Connor.

We were reminded that we had never read it by a compulsively readable extract in the recent Cork Anthology (reviewed in this issue) and were just determining to get it from the library when this hit our desk. Anyone else who somehow missed it, or remembers it with affection and ought to have a copy to re-read, should snap this up. It shines with its own strong in ner light as the story of a remarkable autoaidact, as a loving portrait of his mother, as an account of a chifahood of poverty (but what riches) in Cork, as a personal reminis cence of the civil war.

Longford Press, 18 King Street, Oldwick, NJ USA. 292 pp $tg?20 0-9635572-5-4. Born in 1834, a first-generation Irish-South-African, Scanlen (d. 1912) has been eclipsed by men like Rhodes and Kruger. This well-researched biography, incidentally by a great-great-great grand - nephew of Nathaniel Hone the elder, restores the memory of a significant prime minister and leader of the opposition during the stir ring eighties, and at the same time gives an interesting picture of the complexities that lie behind the present-day state. See also New Light below. &gt;* A Fool for Christ : the priest with the trailer. James A. Feehan. Mercier Press. 160 pp + 8 of photos. ?7.99 pb 1-85635-074-6. Father Jim Meehan(1922-1992)served as a curate in Glas gow before returning to his native Tipperary, where in 1971 he was made administrator of Thurles Cathedral, finally returning as PP to New Inn where he had been a curate, only to step down and become a 'born-again curate'. "Priest of the people, priest of the poor" he is called on a waysiae shrine. He won't make the Calendar, says biographer Feehan, for his foi bles would be grist for the devil's advocate, but "He's a saint! If he's not, there's no hope for the rest of us/' a parishioner remarked. A loving and entertaining book about a real character and real Christian. +* -* * S Goldsmith : interviews and recollections. ed. E. H. Mikhail. Macmillan Press (UK) j St Martins Press (USA). 248 pp Stg?37.50 0-333 45614-9 (Moan.) / 0-312-10193-7 (StM). Con temporary and later pieces on the man by many hands, including Thackeray, Burke, Boswell and Joshua Reynolds, which have not been reprinted or are not otherwise readily available, annotated and with a chronology of his life, extensive bibliography and index. A thorough and valuable collection. * fa ^&lt;^c / An Irish Bishop in Penal Times : the chequered career of Sylvester Lloyd OFM, 1680-1747. Patrick Fagan. Four Courts Press. 207 pp ?19.95 1-85182-U0-9. Franciscan friar and bishop, Lloyd was "a kind of Pimpernel figure, gravely in cahoots with the Jacobite plotters". This study, mainly from his letters in the Stuart Papers in Windsor Castle, opens a window on the dark period 1723-47, illus trated with maps, facsimiles and photo graphs. Fagan, a retired civil servant, is a very accomplished historian who recently won the Mary Alice McNeill award and an M Ahonoris causa from Trinity College. Exemplary layout and typography ++ * / The Laurel and the Ivy : the story of Charles Stewart Parnell and Irish national ism. Robert Kee. Hamish Hamilton. 671 pp + 16 of plates. Stg?20j$29S5 0-241-12858-7. Has enough not been written on Parnell? Well, it seems there was room for this, and that 102 years after his death is time for a big synthesis, more or less popular?at least not ostensibly too academic?of all the scholarship that has appeared, and it is arguable that you couldn't find a more knowledgeable or scrupulous synthesist than Kee. Nor do we use synthesis as a rude word: it's what historians must have, for they have to take positions, exploit new sources, argue among themselves and all too few of them can hold a reader not himself in the game. Kee can, and is historian enough to go back to contemporary newspapers and parliamentary reports to brief himself on what they may have missed or skimmed over and to auote all his sources in extenso at the back, while journalist and writer enough to lead with the punch and play the drama to the full. It is a political biography with enough background to clarify Pamell's significance, and surely the last word on the man for a very long time. It is well indexed, has an interesting set of pictures and nobody could complain about value for money. -? A&gt; // New Light at the Cape of Good Hope : William Porter, the father of Cape Liberal ism. J. L. McCracken. Ulster Historical Founda tion. 160 pp Stg?10.95 pb 0-901905-54-2. Curi ous coincidence that this and First Son of South Africa (above) came in together. Porter, born in Limavady in 1805 and made attorney general of Cape Colony in 1839, gets two mentions in the Scanlen book, but not vice versa, since Por ter's time was rather earlier. He it was who drew up a constitution for a parliament elected equally by blacks and whites in 1854, and so he may well be remembered now. Re fusing all honours, he retired to live out his days in Belfast. A fine and accessible-looking illustrated biography of a good man, but with all academic apparatus. +* ** Richard Davis Webb : Dublin Quaker printer (1805-72). Richard S. Harrison. Red Barn Publishing, Skeagh, Nr Skibbereen, Co Cork. 92 pp + 8 of plates. StgflR?j6 inc. postage, ?10 to USA. pb. A well-researched life of a Dubliner, educated in the Quaker school at Ballitore, which also pro vides light on the reform movements of those days in which he was a considerable activist: temperance, feminism, pacificism, anti-slavery, vegetarianism?and 'the cold-water cure'. He was a friend of Father Mathew and of O'Connell, but kept out of politics. By correspondence with fellow reformers in America he was influential there too. There is a list of some publications from his printing-house, source notes and an index. Production is acceptable?an old IBM golf-ball composer still banging away, and small litho on unfashionably thin paper, with illustrations mostly borrowed from other books. +* *J Rover and Other Cats. Hugh Leonard. Penguin. 140 pp Stg?4.99 pb 0-14-017444-3. We give this its own category partly by way of apol ogy that we passed the book over with a smirk in hardback as perhaps a bit of self-indulgence. But pets can be as important as human partners and relations, and cats are special, and these pieces on Leonard's feline lodgers has been very well re viewed all over. The line illustrations are bril liant, too. Excellent stocking-filler for cat-lovers. CELTIC A The Celts : first masters of Europe. Chris tiane Eluere. Thames &amp; Hudson. 176 pp Stg?6.95 pb 18x13 cm 0-500-30034-8. 'New Horizons' is a remarkable series of small-format books packed with information and illustrations on painters, ancient civilisations, famouspeople, animals and heaven knows what not. They are originated by the French publisher Gallimard, and published in translation by Thames &amp; Hudson. They constitute a new publishing style and achievement and are strongly to be recommended as a sort of endlessly expand ing encyclopedia. Eluere is Head Keeper of French national museums, and specialises in 'protohistoric' collections.

The many colour pictures are im maculate and fascinating. Exploring the World of the Celts. Simon James. Thames &amp; Hudson. 192 pp Stg?16.95 24 x 19 cm 0-50045067-8. Amagaziney encyclopae dic book on very substantial paper, with numer ous interesting illustrations, many in colour, and short, easily-digested chapters on the race from the earliest they can be discerned to (briefly) the present day?their ways of life, arts, wars, migra tions, beliefs and settlements. There is a glossary, a gazetteer of places worth visiting in pursuit of remains, list of further reading categorised by subject, and index. In a sense Eluere's book (above) is a compressed version of the same thing, and James's credentials (he lectures on pre history for the British Museum) are comparable for where he may lack all of Eluere's scholarship, he is more experienced in explicating to the inter ested non-specialist. * ** CENSORSHIP Let in the Light: censorship, secrecy and democracy, ed. Ellen Hazelkorn and Patrick Smyth. Brandon. 188 pp ?7.95 pb 0-86322-173-4. Fourteen people, including some from abroad (notably Salman Rushdie and Carl Bernstein) spoke at a very successful conference hosted by Trinity College Dublin under this book's title in January this year and here, well edited, are their papers. Subjects indude government and busi ness secrecy censorship and the arts, publishing, political censorship and freedom of information.

Irish Management Insti tutef $andyjordRoad,Dublinl6.431pp?21.50pb 24 x 15 cm 0-903352-78-8. The premise of this thesis by an economist who has written widely on unemployment is that the Irish at all levels of society see the unemployment problem as insol uble ("like a death in the family"), and that this 'communal resignation' is the main problem? that there is nothing to fear but fear itself. He analyses the experiences of Austria, Japan, Nor way, Sweden and Switzerland, which have all dealt with unemployment problems with a na tion-wide consensus and determination, and all?as he shows in great detail?have a strong commitment to high-quality education and training, resulting in a high level of skills throughout their populations. In the nature of this argument, the conclusion and recommenda tions have mostly to do with broad policy and strategic shifts by government, trades unions and companies in upping the status of research and development, training, and qualifications. It is a big book to make some simple points, but perhaps there are enough practical pointers in the mass of research and analysis to make its presentation worthwhile, or at least to back the thesis. Layout is clear, clean and immaculate, ta bles, source notes, list of references and index scrupulous. 4?* * / FINANCE The Irish Investment Market: an intro ductory guide. Alan Molloy.

John McKenna and Sally McKenna. Es tragon Press. 334 pp ?11.99 pb 1-874076-08-1. Well, that settles it: this really is the only guidebook necessary or desirable to eating and drinking in Ireland (food-shopping and even buying kitchen implements as well as earing out). A day before its chaotically crowded launching we went to the much less populous Egon Ronay book reception (sorry, no review copy yet) and, chatting with people from e. g. Aroutus Lodge and Patrick Guil baud, discovered how vitally important list ings in the big guides like Ronay and Michelin are to their business. One of the restaurateurs said they had never heard of the McKennas' books, but if true it won't be for long. The problem is more probably that Bridgestone doesn't give either Guilbaud or Arbutus a star or a "worth-a-detour" arrow; they praise them for precisely their virtues (considerable) without fear or favour?with no patronising or faint praise, but always at least a hint of what not to expect as well. Grand tourists will come to discover and rely on Bridgestone where they haven't already?and enjoy it, be cause the writing is always fun. We must not describe the bcok in detail again?it's totally revised, updated and (if possible) improved? except to say it covers north as well as south, gives as much attention to modest eating places and food-producers as to grand ones and (except for les grands snobs de la cuisine francaise perhaps) is one of the most useful books published in or near Ireland. ** v // Cooking with Clifford : new Irish cook ing. Michael Clifford. Mercier Press. 96 pp ?6.99 pb 1-85635-070-3. Late of White's on theGreen in Dublin, and now going it alone in a disused library in Cork (he gets a star from Bridgestone), Clifford is an artist chef, French trained, and here parts with 56 recipes for sauces and stocks, starters, main dishes, vege tables, desserts and breads. There's an inter esting introduction, fashionably commending the use of fresh local produce, while hard-to please Helen Lucy Burke contributes an en thusiastic foreword. Eight pages of colour in the middle add to the glamour and price, but hooray the recipes are one to a page, with no sticky turns, and the book can be made to lie flat. ++ * Irish Vegetarian Cookery, ed. Patrick Cotter. Three Spires Press. 90 pp + 6 for notes. ?4.99 pb 1-873548-11-7. Sixty-plus very useful recipes from ultra-simple (fried parsnips) to very sophisticated (aubergine and tomato red wine fyllo with cucumber raita and goat's cheese-and-walnut salad), the fancy ones mostly coming from the menus of named res taurants. The main aim is to "rescue from cu linary drudgery" the young Irish who are vegetarian by conviction (very many of them) but survive on "on little more than cnips, peas and curry sauce". The typography is gawky but plain, the spelling unreliable (safron, ker nal, carmelised for caramelised etc.)and there's a modest but quite striking cover in colour, while a list of other publishers' cook books is a generous and helpful gesture. It doesn't lie open easily (there's even a warning about breaking the spine) and some recipes have unnecessary page-turns. *+ -* / Jenny Bristow's Today and Everyday Cookbook.

Follower upper toHighdaysand Holidays, which was a No. 1 bestseller in Ireland and Britain on the strength of the UTV appearances of the author, a farmer's wife from Cullybackey, Co Antrim. 160+ recipes of the homely-but-not-dull sort (just what home cooking should be) under such jolly section titles as Fowl play Flash meals with little cash, Saucy ideas and When there's nothing in the tins. Nice big type and stays flat with a little persuasion, but no effort to avoid mid-recipe page-turns. As with Clifford's book above the unreally-gor geous colour photos are obligatory for sales, but almost pointless otherwise. ** ^ * // FURNITURE Irish Country Furniture, 1700-1950. Claudia Kinmonth. Yale University Press. 259 pp (1R)?29.95 27 x 21 cm 0-300-05574-9. Not only 'vernacular' tables, stools, benches, settles, chairs, beds and dressers are lovingly described and illustrated (with lavish use of colour photo graphs) but also hearths and their cranes and ov ens and other built-in appurtenances of cottage and farmhouse?ingenious hinged tables and benches that could be folded out of the way, the ancestors of the flat-dweller's 'put-you-up' as well as cubby-hole beds, and smaller movables like utensils and tools. We did not have long to enjoy this before it went to a reviewer, but all the sooner will you enjoy a review proper. However delightful a book for browsing (and useful for the collector and restorer), this is a serious study of surely considerable value to the student of our social and cultural history. * HEALTH The Check Up Guide to Good Health, ed. Siobh?n Cleary. Town House. 302 pp C6.95 pb 0 948524-83-9. Based on a popular and long-run ning RTE television series, a useful home reference book packed with good-sense advice and debunking a lot of myths about the most common ailments and complaints. There are 24 main chapters on subjects from alcohol and aller gies to weight control, including depression, be reavement and growing old, each by a professional or specialist, but in simple language and broken up by helpful subheadings. Despite the title, the book seems to focus on ill-health, with no general advice on maintaining good health, though there are recommendations on diet, exercise and such under the headings of dif ferent complaints, and a chapter on sleep. There's nothing specifically about children's complaints or on pregnancy. Hypochondria generally is not encouraged or fed, and GPs should surely be glad to see this in their patients' hands. ++ -* * / HISTORY Life and Times series : (1) Henry Grattan.

Maryann Gialanella Valiulis. Irish Academic Press. 301 pp + 16 of photos. 12.50 pb 0-7165-2510-0. We reviewed this in hardback enthusiastically and are delighted to see it has been named Best Book of 1992 in His tory and Social Studies by the American Com mittee on Irish Studies. Strongly commendable in paperback as a study of the war of inde pendence and the civil war as seen in the life of the man who was chief of staff in the former and Minister for Defence as well as commander in chief in the latter. Dr Valiulis is currently in Ire land working on a study of 'gender ideology' in the Free State. ** ?&gt; / history cultural The Fountain by People from the Fountain, ed. Leon McAuley. Arts Council of Northern Ire land and Verbal Arts Centre, Cathedral School Building, London Street, Londonderry BT48 6RQ. 252 pp StgC4.95 pb 25 x 17 cm 0-903203-06-5. If you consider no other book in these pages, consider this one. There are two stupidities about it (neither matter), but the book itself is only brilliant and cannot fail to give real pleas ure to anyone and considerable enlighten ment to writers, critics and even (!) semioti cians as well as those interested in the real voice of ordinary protcstant northern folk. The Fountain is a small, poor loyalist enclave in Londonderry. The Fountain poeple thought of writing a book about themselves and ap proached Sam Burnside at the Verbal Arts Centre, who by inspiration or good luck put Leon McAuley, a new 'Artist in the Commu nity', on to the job. What he has done is bril liantly simple, like all good ideas: he has re corded precisely (he doesn't mention a tape-recorder so we're not sure if it's just that he has a very good ear; and any editorial work is quite invisible) the spoken anecdotes, memories and maunderings of ordinary peo ple, and because spoken language isn't tai lored for print he has set it in lines like poetry "to represent the dynamic of conversation", adding with some understatement that the re sult is "sometimes closer to poetry than Po etry". And?though we would change 'some times' to 'often'?so it is. He has added his own intimate, very human but technically ad mirable photographs of people, to create what is quite certainly as much or more a work of art as any book nere listed. It is a formula that could be copied, too: spoken language every where is worthy of recording in print like this, and much more revealing and startling than written material to eyes accustomed to the lat ter. Leon designed the book as well (we mean equally well), and if it were three times the laughable price we'd recommend it just as strongly. And the two stupidities? One is a bit of blurb apparently designed for Pseud's Cor ner ('This work which was embodied within a combined lifelong education and develop ment framework, had as its main thrust the enabling ..." and it gets worse); the other was an enclosure note that said "Please give this a good review," as if anyone could give it one less than raving. In the heat of the moment it's our book of the year, and we can't imagine the heat fading. +* fa / Paper Tigers : stories of Irish newspapers by the people who make them. Hugh Oram. Appletree Press. 143 pp 9.99 pb 24 x 17 cm 0 86281-439-1.

Northern papers weren't covered on the ra dio, but are brought in here. The photographs are mainly of people, and we would have liked more facsimiles from papers, more ar chive shots (there are some beauts) and more technical and business history, but this is for general readership, and so without index or any of that stuff. Nevertheless very much part of what we are and were, and useful as well as entertaining. *+ -* % J Pleasant the Scholar's Life : Irish intel lectuals and the construction of the Nation State. Maurice Goldring. Serif, 47 Strahan Road, London E3 5DA. An interesting-looking study by the Professor of Irish Studies at the University of Paris of the creation of our nationalist ethos par ticularly by the litterateurs and language revival ists, and of the cosmopolitan antagonists?The Bell, O'Casey, O'Faolain and such. Early chapters are revisions from Faith of Our Fathers, publish ed in Dublin in 1982, and others started life as articles in periodicals, but the whole seems to make a well-integrated and readable thesis by an ex-communist who knows us better perhaps than some of us know ourselves. He concludes on the revisionists and debunkers "It is better to share illusions than destroy them. We are caught in a painful contradiction: nationalism is a con struction, an ideology, but it is not an illusion. Nationalism is in people's heads, so people have to be shot in the head to dislodge those wrong ideas." He cites his sources and provides an in dex to this amenable-looking book. * * HISTORY LOCAL From Dun Delca to Dundalk : the to pography and archaeology of a medieval town A.D. c. 1187-1700. Paul Gosling. County Louth Archaeological and Historical Society, 5 Oliver Plunkett Park, Dundalk. 135pp + 6 folding maps. ?5.95 pb 25 x 18 cm 0-9521456-0-X. Strangely this reprint from the Society's journal seems to sell itself short: chapters 4 and 5 deal in some detail with periods including pre-historic before 1187 and there are at least mentions of dar ings (as distinct from references) into the eight eenth and even nineteenth centuries. It is a highly professional work of research on the physical his tory of what was a major frontier town between Pale and Gael, from the Anglo-Normal Castle town to the first settlement below it on the estu ary and its development of streets and defences. The 34 maps (facsimiles and reconstructions), plans and drawings are done with exceptional competence, there is a catalogue of medieval ar tefacts found in the urban district and a quite re markable bibliography. We have highly praised Paul Gosling's more popular-level guide to Car lingford for antiquarians recently; here he is writ ing at professional level and presenting a decade of research with the same authority, clarity and care. ++ * # // HISTORY POPULAR Distant Drums : Irish soldiers in foreign Heids. Myles Dungan. Appletree Press. 192 pp + 24 of plates. ?739 pb 0-86281-384-0. Based on an RTE radio series of the same title, with some additional 'beefing-up' and research by the producer-author, some accounts of our fight ing men in the American civil war, American native wars, the two world wars, Korea and Vietnam (the latter two curiously labelled The Cold War'). In his introduction Mr Dun gan says that the "infant tradition" of UN peacekeeping is outside his remit, and so are many other conflicts, including the Boer War (surely the subject of the nice cover illustra tion) but within this narrow scope there are reasonably representative accounts, and the illustrations are equally random-but-interest ing. Bibliography but no index. + * An Irish Almanac: notable events in Ire land from 1014 to the present* Aidan H. Cre aky. Mercier Press. 196 pp ?6.99 pb 1-85635-035 5. Not a chronology but a calendar with notes on events up to June 1992 that happened on each date, with the year supplied. The listings are mainly political, but social, literary, aca demic, artistic and legal events are also well covered. In addition there is a list of centena ries, including births and deaths, from 1994 to 2003 and?for looking things up when you don't know the date?indexes to events, peo ple and places. The publishers list armchair historians, quiz-masters etc. as likely to find this useful, but perhaps the chief users will be journalists. Among other centenaries in 1994 is the fifth of Poyning's Law, which restricted legislation in the Irish parliament to measures first approved by the British. We do hope his tory isn't going to be repeated. *+ -* %S Irish Generals in the British Army in the second world war. Richard Doherty. Appletree Press. 201 pp + 16 of photos. ?7.99 pb 0-86281 395-6. Maybe this and Distant Drums (above) should be in a War category, or this in Biogra phy but categories always overlap. Curiously this too is based on a radio series (BBC this time). As well as the obvious Montgomery, Al exander, Auchinleck, Brooke and Templer, an accomplished military historian writes of five less widely-known leaders who prove at least as interesting, and particularly analyses whether theirlrish connections had a bearing on their success.

This may be a very important book, particularly if loyalists read it to find out what the other lot mean by identity?but will they? One encouragement to them (and off putter to the Taigs) is the cover painting by Rita Duffy which, caricature-like, portrays Catholics as Protestant loyalists see them or perhaps pretend to?ugly, priest-rid den, over-fertile and wedded to poverty and underdoggishness. This might be the book's only fault if fault it is. / Northern Ireland: a chronology of the troubles 1968-1993. Paul Bew and Gordon Gillespie. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 360 pp ?8.99 pb 0 7171-2081-3. We have seen a 20-year chronol ogy (1968-88) from Island Publications, and a 19/0-91 one in the book about Fortnight maga zine, Troubled Times, but this for completeness, historical perspective (not easy when the last event recorded happened last June), and ex cellence of editing and design, certainly takes the biscuit. They nave been 25 long and very sad years, and we hardly dare say?for there have been moments of hope before?that 25 will prove to be all. Events nere get listings of from two lines to occasionally (the banning of the UDA for instance) more than a page, and there are additional 'boxes' with dissertations on landmark events. Rudimentary maps show the province and street plans of Belfast and Deny, there's a bibliography and an index with a peculiar and quite serious fault: the sec ondary listings are in chronological instead of alphabetical order, which is particularly an noying for a book itself ordered chronologi cally. For instance to find the Natwest Tower bombing you must look up 'Provisional IRA British campaign' (or 'London' to be referred to the latter), and then run hopefully through a list of 75 events, while the Trrovisional IRA' entry subtends over 220 non-alphabetical en tries, many not separately indexed. Helen Lit ton is the busiest and probably best indexer in the business; maybe she was instructed to do it this way. That is the only fault we could de tect in a most useful reference book?and one, incidentally, that you could sit down and read mi * as a concise and authoritative history, if rather jerky of course in narrative style. ** * War and an Irish Town. Eamonn McCann. Pluto Press. 320 pp Stg?9.95 pb 0-7453-0725-6 (hb Stg?30 -0830-9). Few could quarrel with the publisher's description of this as a classic It is a powerful account of what it meant to grow up a Catholic in Derry and of the beginnings of the present era of conflict. The original 1974 edition is reproduced without change, and McCann has added a 62-page introduction in which he sur veys and interprets events since then, and admits it was "something of a cheek" to have pointed to Marxism as the final solution, since he did noth ing to advance that cause for some years after. Now he argues persuasively that the ruling pow ers, north, south and British show by their reper toire of ideas that they really want no fundamental change and "fear nothing so much as that the plain people should rise up and free ourselves from the domination of the identities which divide us... with people of our own class. Class. That's what can unite us ... We will have socialism or we will have barbarism." But we are not sure if he explains how the former can be obtained. * A ** NOVELS The Consequence.

First novel by a man born in the midlands in 1940 who was ordained in Car low and worked as a priest in Britain before going to the University of Seattle and leaving the priesthood.

It's about the twin of a man brutally murdered during the civil war, and other agonising echoes of the conflict in a small town a generation later, when Dev and President Sean T.

More than a touch of autobiography, we'd think, in this novel by the west-Li merick-born poet who married Rupert Strong and was a devotee and friend of psychoanalyst Jonathan Hanaghan: it's about a 19-year-old Limerick girl coming to Dublin in 1942 and falling in love with a Protestant English psychoanalyst twelve years her senior?and having to choose between him and her family.

Here's a curiosity: what appears to be a whodunnit (five mur ders, an Irish stock-exchange scandal, strange happenings down on the farm), lively and with lots of dialogue, and with sections nar rated by different characters. But then we dipped and found one of them taking off in a rocket and visiting different planets, so what ever is going on is more original and odd than the standard article. Some details (humerous and hillarious so spelt in the blurb for in stance) suggest a touch of the amateur Pub lishings, but the editing?apart from overuse of exclamation marks?and setting seem ac ceptable. It just might be an exciting find that better-known publishers have missed: who knows? *+ -* S Telling the Pictures. Frank Delaney. Har per Collins. 413 pp Stg?4.99 0-00-224188-9. The second in his romantic blockbuster mode (af ter The Sins of the Mothers), about a protestant mill-girl in Belfast in the forties, her cross-faith affair with a silver-tongued man from the south, and how eventually they both stand trial for murders?and one of them hangs. There's a kind of sub-plot running reference to Gone With the Wind. Good for a solid bit of weepy reading over the holiday. The blurb mentions that this is the second of five novels about Ireland?a pentalogy, no less, and not we hope a penance too. # S When Love comes to Town. Tom Lennon.

A young, macho Dubliner with conven tional parents keeps up a masculine front until he tells a friend that he's gay?and then finally 'comes ouf, with all that that entails among fam ily, friends and the gay scene.

John Banville. Gallery Books. 197 pp ?13.95 1-85235-127-6 (pb ?6.95 -126-8). Those who have been astonished and rivetted by his later books might well want to discover his first novel, published in 1971, described as "elu sive" about a writer untangling his relationships with a cast of improbable figures in an improb able plot in the Aegean, an "elaborate artifact". Sounds like the Banville we know, all right. ** ORNITHOLOGY The Complete Guide to Ireland's Birds. Eric Dempsey and [illust.l Michael CTClery. Gill &amp; Macmillan. 262 pp ?14.99 25 x 18 cm 0-7171 1973-4. The blurb?with not a misleading word?says this is lavish, magnificently de signed and illustrated, comprehensive and authoritative. We would add 'superlative'. For each of 310 species, some rare, seen this century there is a colour illustration as the common or garden twitcher is most likely to see it, then a concise description (with its name in English, Latin and Irish), two shorter notes on 'voice and dief and 'habitat and status', then a distribution map clearly distinguishing between residents and summer and winter visitors as well as be tween common and rare, and finally detailed col our illustrations showing seasonal and male-female variations of shape and plumage. The pages are crystal clear and arranged so that you can flick through in either direction to iden tify by picture or by running head?bird type or genus top left or species top right with an indica tion of size. At the end there are less detailed en tries for over a hundred extremely rare visitors, illustrated where necessary. Up front there's an illustrated introduction to the whole subject, quite accessible to the neophyte or young person, and at the tail-end a bibliography and separate indexes to binomials and to the English and Irish names. Clearly this could not be a pocket book, but at 700 grams in glazed boards no enthusiast would reject it from his knapsack, while it should be in the glove-compartment of every outdoor person's car. Illustrator Michael O'CIery has wit as well as scrupulous knowledge and technique: the Pied Wagtail is perched on a pedestrian light signal clearly disregarding the 'don't walk' [or wag?] sign, the pigeon is parked on a double yel low line and the rare Rose-coloured Starling shows off his apparel on a clothes-line. No de signer is credited; type-setting is by Seton Music Graphics whom we have noticed before as a first class operator.

Society of Irish Foresters (distrib. Eason and Hughes). 60 pp 16.95 28x25 cm 0-9520476-0-8. Marking the fifty years of the Society of Irish Foresters comes a most handsome and pleasant book (Oben Design, with fine duotone photos by Colour Repro, printed by Baird of Belfast) showing woodlands, foresters planting and felling and much more, in the thirties and for ties: the slow reinstatement of Ireland's long lost wealth. The Jesuit photographer must have had a special weakness for trees (he made a film on forestry work in the forties) and was certainly a master of his craft. The Society's aim to give us few words and many pictures results in a very readable and infor mative text and captions and a book to put beside Nelson's new Trees of Ireland (we ha ven't seen it yet) without shame to either. * + The Way We Were : historic Armagh pho tographs from the Allison collection.

This 'radically re vised' edition of the first includes poems pre viously omitted.

A serious and very interesting examination of the neo-Nazi skinhead culture in the British mid lands, noticed here because photographer author Regan is a Dubliner. There is a perspicacious introduction by Nicholas Mosley (perhaps a relative of the English pro-Hitlerist of the thirties??though he clearly doesn't inherit his leanings) and many fascinating transcrip tions of tape recordings made by skinheads about their beliefs and way of life. Half the book is given to black-and-white photographs of the public and private lives of these people, in the very highest traditions of photo-journalism. We could not help thinking how easily this or a simi lar sub-culture?in which hate and violence are more a cult than a means to an end?could de velop out of current para militarism in Northern Ireland when and if some sort of peace is estab lished. *# sport Classic Football Matches.

Account of thirty great Gaelic football games of the past forty years, including first All-Ireland wins, 'landmark' matches of various sorts and those in which exceptional skill or individual per formances were seen. The photographs are in two groups, although they they could have been scattered near or beside relevant text since the paper they're on seems identical. We have noticed this before in G&amp;M's books and wonder whether they are using the tradition of separate 'plates', now mostly outdated by technical progress, to save the bother of plac ing pictures where appropriate?and whether they'd gain more sales (particularly of sports books for instance, where readers might not easily tolerate much unbroken text) if flicking through revealed more exciting pages?

As well as a host of black-and white photographs, some from the nineteenth century and all of immense value and charm, this provides quite complete written histories of the six little railways that the GSR inherited in 1925 including the dramatic Tralee &amp; Dingle, plus the unique Listowel &amp; Ballybunion Lartigue mono rail. A very helpful feature is good facsimiles of Ordnance Survey maps covering each line, and there are chapters on industrial railways and the revivals for tourists and by enthusiasts. In glazed boards, there's a bibliography and index, and volume 2 on The Ulster Lines is on its way. Ire land was uniquely rich in 3-foot-gauge tracks and this is of value to railway buffs worldwide, but very beguiling for anyone. A * * / TRAVEL Ar Bh?d Chonrai go Meirice?. Colm Dubh ? Mealoid.

Inland Wa Wrrvays Association of Ireland c/o Sean's ttar, Ath hme. 283 pp + 28 of plates. ?16, no ISHN. A fac simile, with the many photographs remarkably well reproduced and even the original title-page and jacket, of an evergreen. Tom Rolt was the author of books on English canals and railways, and in 1946 (with petrol verv scarce) cruised thcShannon and the Irish Grand and Royal canals. This book about the voyage?and side-trips around Ireland?was first published in 1949. It is oneof the best and most sensitive and observant ever of the now common genre of Englishmen recording their Irish visits, and now nearly half a century later it is of historical and nostalgic value, but comes as fresh as if it were written yesterday. It is reproduced from the second edition with the author's 1968 foreword commending Ca nals of the South of Ireland, and the publishers have neatly inserted another by Ruth Delany, one of the authors of that book and of many others, in turn commending this, and usefully listing the many changes to our waterways since it first appeared. Even non-boating peo ple will enjoy it, while for those who know and use our waterways it is simply invaluable. Walking through Ireland. Robin Neil lands. Little, Brown. 286 pp + 16 of photos. StgjlRC14.99 0-316-90427-9. An English travel writer who has done books on walking across France and Spain, here does the same for Ireland north and south, starting at the Gianfs Cause way and taking in mainly the west to end on Car rantuohill. Since he is also a 'popular historian', his main interest is in unravelling our history, but he records people he meets, b&amp;bs, pub lunches, music sessions, bogs, mountains and the Aran islands too. The middling photos record just what would appeal to walkers?emptiness, lovely scenery and tourist-interest sights. Excep tionally clear maps record the route and he adds a walker's kit-list, a short bibliography, useful addresses (tourist and walkers' information and London sources of maps) and an index mostly of places. Thank you, Mr Neillands, for your contri bution to our tourist publicity, and Little, Brown for sensibly fixing the Irish price. A note "not for sale in the USA" of course means almost the op posite: that an American edition probably is or will be available. -* WOMEN'S STUDIES Image and Experience : photographs of Irishwomen c. 1880-1920. Myrtle Hill and Vivienne Pollock. Blackstaff Press. 199 pp Stg 14.95 pb 25x 27 cm 0-85640-507-9. A big, wide paperback of valuable and fascinating pictures of women and girls at work, at play, at politics, at school, at worship, at war?and of course at home. Mostly they are nameless, but portraits of for instance Rosamund Praeger, Fanny Parnell and Eva Gore-Booth are here too. The short text introducing each section and the extended captions look well researched but it is the camera as social com mentator and window on the past that pro vides the main insights in an all too unusual dimension. + * Irish Women's Studies Reader, ed. Ail bhe Smyth. Attic Press. 287 pp ?15.99 pb 1 855940-52-3. If 'reader' suggests a collection of landmark texts from times past, be disabused: this is an interdisciplinary (sociological, eco nomic, legal, religious, sexual, political, literary, cultural) collection or 'sampler' of 14present-day and recent key articles and essays (most if not all from periodicals or other books) for use as a text book in third-level and adult studies. Each piece lists its own source notes and books for further reading, and a list of topics for discussion, there are notes on the contributors (including one Mary Robinson and most of the other big names in Women's Studies) and an index. It is surely a definitive and reliable work setting the social, le gal and personal agenda for activists as well as providing a strong scaffold around which courses of studies can be built. We admired the simplicity and authority of the cover and typo graphy. * * / YOUNG ADULTS Donny Goes for Goal! Joe Buckley. Wolf hound Press. 192 pp ?3.99 pb 0-86327-415-3.

Sequel to the very suc cessful Urban Heroes, about five young people (not all male) and soccer; but, though Gavin and Jake are going professional, the book isn't ob sessed by football: Elaine is still torn between soc cer and athletics, Luke is pigeon-mad and Jake's band is on the up and up.

Good ideas are often a matter of putting two and two together and getting sixteen. Mullen's premises were the endless popularity of mod em children going back in time (was the fabu list Fabian Edith Nesbit the first? Probably not. To be honest we still re-read her and with intense pleasure) and parents' demand for books about Christmas for Christmas. Daniel's friend, a carpenter, builds a crib, and Daniel steps inside it to find himself in Bethle hem?and in danger from Herod's men (the risk of not coming back to your own time is a vital ingredient: Herod was tailor-made for Mullen!)

This might be the best of this big list, at least for 9-13 (publisher says 8-11, but it would surely be read-aloud for under the av erage nine). Mac Raois has a special way with realistic magic (the Giltspur books) and when a Dominilli?a sort of leprechaun?comes to stay with Jim and Caitriona there's chaotic fun as well. Katharine White's cover and draw ings are brilliant, and we'd guess they match the story in that. + -* fa / The Joke Thief. Gordon Snell. Poolbeg. 92 pp ?2.99 pb 1-85371-308-2.
