<plain_text><page sequence="1">The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs, agenda for a new approach Allan Forbes, Jr. and Thomas R. Crowder Prehistorians traditionally have divided the Upper Palaeolithic art of Franco-Cartabria into two major categories - mobiliary works on small portable objects and parietal works on the walls of caves and rockshelters. This distinction is presumably based otn the principle that the location of a work of art is more important than its content. A more useful dichotomy may be drawn between representational and non-representational art. Representational works, both mobiliary and parietal, generally depict herbivorous animals such as bison, horses, mammoths, wild cattle, ibexes, deer, reindeer and the rhinoceros. With the exception of lions and bears, carnivores are rare. Anthropomorphic figures, which tend to have a curious animal-human ambiguity, while not uncommon, are heavily outnumbered by images of animals. Non-representational images come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. They may appear alone or in direct association with representational images, most often of animals. Andre Leroi-Gourhan considers the non-representational works or 'abstract signs', as he calls them, to be the 'most fascinating area of Paleolithic art' (1967: 136). The abstract signs are, indeed, fascinating but they are- also extremely enigmatic. For more than a century they have defied all attempts to interpret them. Today they are largely forgotten. The purpose of this paper is to raise once again the question of their significance. Plate i contains a selection of different types of abstract signs. Dots in various combinations are a common form of sign. An Aurignacian plaque from the Gorge d'Enfer (plate ioa) has several rows of dots. A cruciform sign at El Castillo (plate Iob) consists of several hundred dots. A horse at Pech Merle (plate i oc) is covered with red and black dots. Dots and lines combine to form complex marking at Niaux (plate lod), and at Marsoulas (plate ioe). Vertical rows of dots are juxtaposed to curious quadrangular forms at El Castillo (plate iof). At another Cantabrian site, El Pindal, a cave wall has a set of dots with claviform signs (,) adjacent to them (plate iog). Above this design is a large bison that may or may not be associated with the marks. A complex series of markings that are vaguely quadrangular in form cover a wall at La Pileta (plate ioh). From time to time prehistorians have proposed specific interpretations of abstract signs. The dots on the Pech-Merle horse (plate ioc) have been variously regarded as wounds, as celestial constellations, and as symbols of the decomposing bodies of animals killed in the hunt (Lemozi 1929: 102, 103, io6).

These theories, as well as a number of others, have fallen into disfavour. The current theory, and the only comprehensive one ever proposed, is Leroi-Gourhan's 'metaphysical system of male and female symbolism' (Ucko and Rosenfeld i967: I50). In this system dots and lines symbolize masculinity (Leroi-Gourhan 1967: 514); hence, the first three abstract signs (plate ioa, b, c) are male signs. The signs from Niaux and Marsoulas (plate iod, e) are what we might call 'multiple' male signs. Leroi-Gourhan classifies quadrangular shapes and claviform signs as female symbols (1967: 513); thus the dots and quadrangles (plate rof) and the dots with claviforms (plate log) form paired male-female signs. The signs at La Pileta (plate Ioh) are female symbols. The simplest type of abstract sign consists of groups of lines. As a rule this sort of sign appears on mobiliary artefacts; a Lower Magdalenian staff, perhaps 15,000 years old, bears on one of its three faces a set of thirty-seven lines, thus: 7-7Iff1'J T- Alexander Marshack, who for many years has specialized in the study of upper Paleolithic mobiliary art, interprets the lines as a lunar count of thirty-seven days (1972: 88). These lines, like similar groups of lines on other objects are, according to Marshack, lunar notation; that is, a Paleolithic calendar. An Upper Magdalenian staff dating back to perhaps 12,000 B.C. has five separate groups of engraved lines as well as another group of a different type, all six in direct association with animal images. Marshack regards the five groups as lunar notation. The sixth group consists of five marks, A ) A X A X , which, he says, 'may be symbols of a different meaning' (I972: 265). These five marks, and a large number of similar marks frequently found on both mobiliary objects and cave walls, differ from other abstract signs. They appear singly or in small groups of two or three, and sometimes in long and complex sequences. Often they are directly associated with images of animals. A selection of the more common marks appears in fig. T. Marshack has excluded this type of mark from his investigations, 4 1 Q [D A /1\/l\ r( 1 A + ?: v \l/v v D pQ 9j 11 U Ba PE Ewm E9 tIlmcI Fn mn W' X 1 i b 1&gt; I 1 \ W V VV I 11 t \ h my / y f' { Yw E ?

The exception is Leroi-Gourhan who includes many of these marks in his typologies of sexual symbols (1967: 513, 514). Leroi-Gourhan classifies the marks in fig. 2a as female symbols, those in fig. zb are male symbols.

However, when marks appear in lengthy and elaborate sequences such as those shown below in figs. 6, 7, and 8, it seems less plausible that they should have a sexual significance. If we interpret sequence j in fig. 7 according to Leroi-Gourhan's system, we get a female-female-male- male-male-female-male-female-male translation which seems hardly more than gibber- ish, even for Ice Age reindeer hunters. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that in this relatively brief sequence the engraver would have used three different symbols to denote femaleness. Other sequences of marks, when deciphered according to Leroi-Gourhan's theory, give equally unsatisfactory results. The marks in fig. I are potentially the most important type of Franco-Cantabrian abstract sign, and they are, curiously enough, also the most neglected. It is to these marks that this paper is primarily addressed. In the course of preparing this study, several findings concerning the marks have emerged. It is clear, first of all, that paintings and petroglyphs at Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic sites in North and South America, Africa, Melanesia, and Europe contain marks that are strikingly similar, and in some instances identical, to Franco-Cantabrian marks. Figure 3 shows a number of the more common marks that closely resemble marks from Franco-Cantabria.

Hunter-gatherer societies and horticultural peoples tend to share specific sets of ideas about nature and society, to make similar tools, and to have zoomorphic schools of art. It is somewhat more surprising to find that a sizeable proportion of the signs, characters, and letters in early written languages from the Mediterranean basin resemble Franco- Cantabrian marks. The extent of these correspondences we may judge by comparing the</page><page sequence="4">The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs: agenda for a new approach 353 marks in fig. i with their equivalents in the ancient Mediterranean written languages shown in fig. 4. As we can see from the Indus Valley signs (fig. 4c), the distribution of Franco- Cantabrian correspondences extends well beyond the immediate region of the Mediter- ranean. We can, in fact, find parallels with Franco-Cantabrian marks as far from the Mediterranean as China.

Thus we see that many ancient written languages, as well as prehistoric pottery marks, have unmistakable correspondences with parietal and</page><page sequence="5">354 Allan Forbes, Jr. and Thomas R.

As striking as they are, these correspondences may, of course, be fortuitous. The similarities between the various Mediterranean languages in fig. 4 are a different matter; here the geographic and chronological discontinuities are relatively minor. The English archaeologist W. M. F. Petrie claimed that the number of signs used in all forms of writing in the ancient Mediterranean totalled no more than sixty (I912: 6). I. J. Gelb, a contemporary authority on the development of the alphabet, attributes this to the ease with which the sixty signs could be 'learned and remembered' (1969: 144). This explana- tion is not entirely convincing; it is true that the signs are easy to learn and to remember; however, literacy at this period, we may assume, was restricted to a relatively small number of professional scribes. Such men doubtless could have learned and remembered almost any set of symbols precisely as their Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Egyptian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Achaemenid counterparts mastered different and comparatively complex systems of writing. Petrie offered a more complex explanation for the correspondences between Mediter- ranean written languages. Two alphabets from opposite ends of the Mediterranean - Carian and Iberian - displayed a 'nearly identical variety of signs', and shared many 'exact relations of form and sound' (1912: 2, 7). Petrie could find no evidence to suggest that either of the two derived from the other; he therefore inferred that 'some common base must underlie' both of them (1912: 7). Petrie also discovered that forty-four of the sixty basic Mediterranean signs appeared on prehistoric Egyptian pottery dating from a period before hieroglyphs came into use (I912: 6). Petrie claimed that prehistoric signs (fig. 5c) must have preceded hieroglyphs and pictographs (1912: 3); most authorities had assumed the opposite to be the case. From the similarities between. the Carian and Iberian alphabets and the prehistoric Egyptian pottery marks, Petrie concluded that the three must have a common and 'very remote' origin (I912: 7). Twenty-two of the forty- four Egyptian marks have close parallels with marks in fig. i. Is it possible that Franco- Cantabrian marks are the 'very remote' protosignary for prehistoric Egyptian pottery marks, and perhaps also for the ancient Mediterranean written languages?</page><page sequence="6">The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs: agenda for a new approach 355 How did Franco-Cantabrians use their marks? Occasionally, marks appear singly or in extremely brief sequences of two or three. It is the longer sequences, however, that we are concerned with here.

The sequences in fig. 8 are also parietal, but seem slightly different: several (e, f, m, n, o) appear to combine conventional marks with what may be schematized animal forms. All these sequences, mobiliary as well as parietal, are undoubtedly intentional, and we may reasonably assume that they have some significance. Leroi-Gourhan asserts that the meaning of the signs and marks, 'even of the most abstract ones, was clear to all who used them' (I967: 80). Most authorities concur with this view, and yet there are no satisfactory interpretations for any of the sequences in figs 6, 7, and 8. Some specialists believe that a particular type of mark (fig. 6d, e; fig. 7p, t) represents either a wound or a weapon. Leroi-Gourhan interprets these marks as sexual symbols; many of them figure in his typologies. The marks A, 1, /|\, and^, despite their apparent 'masculine' character, he classifies as female signs. None of these theories seems to shed much light on the dilemma of the sequences. We may note, however, that the marks /t,(, /1, and I have counter- parts in several of the Mediterranean written languages of fig. 4. We have thus far observed only simple morphological comparisons between Franco- Cantabrian marks, and similar marks and signs from other cultures. There are further correspondences which, although still morphological, have syntactical implications, and are, therefore, more interesting.

A somewhat similar representation of the head of a bull or ox appears in an early Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptiorr, j l gand in a proto-Sinaitic inscription A 2&lt; (Sethe I926: 463). An Indus Valley seal from Mohenjo-Daro (fig. 9a) shows a different sort of use of a bull's head. Indus Valley seals are generally regarded as having two distinct parts: a written insciption at the top, and a large herbivore underneath. However, in some cases the animal may form a part of the inscription. The horns of the bull in fig. 9a extend into the inscriptive area of the seal; there is no doubt but that they match the signs in the inscription, and they have precisely the same curve that the sign next to them, , has. This sign is virtually identical to a Franco-Cantabrian claviform mark. Two other seals (Marshall 1931: plate CVI, 88, 91) provide further evidence in support of the hypothesis that animals are sometimes a part of the inscription. The first inscrip- tion (fig. 9b) includes a round, wheel-shaped sign; the animal in the last seal (fig. 9c) has the same sign on its neck. On a sizeable number of Indus Valley seals (Marshall I931: plates CXI, 357; CXII, 365, 373, 387) the animals also appear to be a part of the inscrip- tion. It is apparent that ancient scribes used the head or horns of a bull as a sign in much the same way that Franco-Cantabrians used the bull's head and horns in a sequence of marks.</page><page sequence="17">358 Allan Forbes, Jr. and Thomas R. Crowder a~ ~b c14 cl a Figure 9 Indus Valley seals: a, Hanmblin 1973: 37; b, c, Marshall. 193 In later written languages the pictograph of a bull undergoes a radical schematization, becoming '", the proto-Semitic and North Semitic letters aleph (Taylor 1883: 78), the Greek alpha, and eventually the Roman 'A9. The schematized version of the bull's head is essentially indistinguishable from the mark ye engraved on a Magdalenian staff found at Gourdan in the Haute-Garonne (Piette 1905: 4). Franco-Cantabrians, it seems, were the first to invent equivalents of both the pictographic and schematized forms of a bull's head; furthermore, they used both versions in sequences with other marks. Although no one knows what the sequences in figs 6, 7, and 8 are, we can at least say what they are not. They are not, for instance, decoration. Franco-Cantabrian decoration is almost always based on the same principle - repetition of a specific motive -- as is decoration generally. The complex and discrete structure of many of the sequences seems to rule out the likelihood of decoration. There are a limited number of other possibilities. Several early prehistorians suggested that brief and simple mobiliary sequences such as 7 //, and might be propertyarks, akers marks, hunting scores or tally counts (Lartet and Christy 1865-75; Part I: 164-6). These two sequences, and others like them, may well have one or another of such meanings, but the sequences in figs 6, 7, and 8 are far too complex for such simple devices. Furthermore, a cave wall would seem to be a rather implausible location for property marks or maker's marks. Mnemonic devices are yet another possibility. Paolo Graziosi (i960: 99) has suggested that several mobiliary sequences (fig. 6j, k) might be mnemonic aids. This also seems unlikely; the simplicity of most mnemtonic devices used by historic Palaeolithic and Neolithic peoples argues against the probability that these sequences and the others that we have seen could be mnemonic. However, it does not seem out of the question that the thirty-seven lines on the Early Magdalenian staff discussed earlier, might be mnemonic, despite Marshack's contention that they represent lunar notation. We may legitimately assume that a society capable of producing the masterful frescoes at such sites as Font-de-Gaume, Altamira, La Pasiega, Niaux, and Lascaux, should have been capable of inventing property marks, maker's marks, hunting scores, tally counts or memory aids. I. J. Gelb regards property marks, even the very simplest, as an 'import- ant step in the direction of writing'; mnemonic aids, he says, are an 'important factor leading directly to the development of real writing' (1969: 36, 192). If Gelb is correct in these views, and if Franco-Cantabrians invented property marks and mnemonic devices, as seems possible, then they were on the verge of discovering a form of writing. We</page><page sequence="18">The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs: agenda for a new approach 359 have seen that complex sequences do not appear to represent property marks or any of the extremely simple devices discussed above. There are no plausible alternatives other than those discussed here. Hence, the sole remaining possibility is writing, perhaps not writing as we know it today, but a precursor form not differing fundamentally from inscriptions in early written languages. The proposition that Ice Age reindeer hunters invented writing fifteen thousand years ago or more is utterly inadmissible and unthinkable. All the data that archaeologists have amassed during the last one hundred years reinforce the assumption that Sumerians and Egyptians invented true writing during the second half of the fourth millennium. The Palaeolithic-Mesolithic-Neolithic progression to civilization is almost as fundamental an article of contemporary scientific faith as heliocentrism. Writing is the diagnostic trait, the quintessential feature of civilization. Writing, says I. J. Gelb (1969: 22I), 'distinguishes civilized man from barbarian'. If Franco-Cantabrians invented writing thousands of years before civilization arose in the Near East, then our most cherished beliefs about the nature of society and the course of human development would be demolished. The possibility of Franco-Cantabrian writing, as preposterous as it may seem to us today, was common among early prehistorians. In 1867 Felix Garrigou suggested that markings on a mobiliary artefact from La Vache might be 'the first characters that served to represent an idea by signs' (1867: 5). Professor T. R. Jones read a paper before the British Anthropological Society in 1872 that attributed an 'inscriptive' significance to several sequences of mobiliary marks (Lartet and Christy I865-I875 Part I: 198, 2oi). In Reliquiae Aquitanicae Lartet and Christy expressed a similar view of mobiliary marks (1865-75, Part II: i66). Thirty years later Edouard Piette announced that Franco- Cantabrians possessed two different types of writing (1905: 9), one consisting of picto- graphic characters, the other a cursive script (fig. 6j). Three years later Armand Vire published a Magdalenian staff (fig. 6n) bearing marks that he interpreted as 'true writing' (1908: 4I9). Needless to say, all these assertions were based on somewhat inadequate evidence. For all practical purposes, the question of Franco-Cantabrian writing came to an end with Piette and Vire. They had revived the old issue at a most unpropitious moment - the very years during which prehistorians were discovering many of the most important parietal sites. Most specialists, stunned by the spectacular new works, quickly transferred their attention from the smaller and less dramatic mobiliary engravings to parietal art. The possibility that wall paintings and engravings, and their associated signs and marks, might represent writing occurred only to a few men. Georges Courty suggested in 1928 that parietal images formed a 'true written language' with a logical meaning. He regarded the walls of caves as a sort of 'writing tablet' (1928: 238, 240). The Abbe Breuil described a sequence at La Pasiega (fig. 7m) as a 'symbolic inscrip- tion' composed of 'cabalistic figures' and 'mysterious characters' (1913: 36). Breuil in 1935 took a second look at the marks on the ceiling at Altamira and wondered if they were not 'written characters of an unknown alphabet' (1935: 57). After copying more than a hundred marks Breuil decided that they were not inscriptive. Georges Bataille thought that complex markings at El Castillo might be 'some crude system of writing'</page><page sequence="19">360 Allan Forbes, Jr. and Thomas R. Crowder (1955: 91). Leroi-Gourhan (I967: 57) alludes to the possibility that anthropomorphic figures may have evolved towards a 'sort of pre-ideographic code'. Marshack observes that his extremely simple sets of strokes and lines are 'not yet writing', but he adds that the 'roots. . of writing seem to be here' (I972: 57). Obviously the possibility of Franco- Cantabrian writing has been in the minds of pre-historians since the earliest days. We may well ask how it has been possible that no concerted investigation has ever been undertaken of the sequences in figs 6, 7, and 8, which are the most likely of all abstract signs to have an inscriptive significance. Men invent writing, as we know, out of an imperative need, whether financial, administrative, imperial or some other. What possible need could have led Upper Paleolithic European hunters to invent a form of writing? This we cannot know; how- ever, they might well have experienced needs other than economic, administrative or imperial. Early Runic inscriptions often consist of only a single word, an invocation of good luck, the name of a deceased kinsman or of some object (Thompson I974: 36). It is not necessary to speculate on the nature of this need; suffice it to say that Franco- Cantabrians incontrovertibly had some fundamental need to engrave and to paint complex sequences of marks on mobiliary artifacts and on cave walls. This particular need, we should bear in mind, did not originate with Upper Paleolithic hunters, but with their non-conspecific Neanderthal and Acheulean ancestors. In i909 Denis Peyrony excavated a Neanderthal burial at La Ferrassie. Beside the skeleton of a male juvenile Neanderthal he found a stone object (1934: 24) bearing marks that he regarded as intentional (fig. ioa). These marks are not dissimilar to those on a aTI /A 1ii{JiL Ki a b c Figure o1 Marks on Neanderthal, Magdalenian, and Acheulean artefacts; a, after Peyrony 1934: fig. 25; b, after Breuil and Obermaier 1935: fig. 171; c, after Marshack 1975: 85 Magdalenian artefact (fig. iob). If the Neanderthal marks are intentional, as Peyrony believed, then we must move back the tradition of engraving marks on mobiliary objects to the Mousterian period c. 45,000 B.C., prior to the emergence of Homo sapiens. Peyrony's discovery of the remarkable Neanderthal piece has now been superseded by a far more astonishing find. The noted geologist and archaeologist FranCois Bordes recently found an ox rib in an Acheulean site in France, Le Pech de I'Aze (1969: 6). Engraved on the rib are marks that Bordes later described as 'clearly intentional' (1972:</page><page sequence="20">The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs: agenda for a new approach 36I 62). Marshack subjected the marks to microscopic analysis and pronounced them 'certainly intentional' (1975: 85). The marks on this Acheulean mobiliary artefact (fig. Ioc), which is at least 150,000 years old, are more complex than are the marks on either the Neanderthal or the Magdalenian objects. Bordes calls his discovery 'very interesting' (I972: 62); Marshack finds it 'intriguing' (I975: 85). Surely the ox rib is one of the most significant, if not the most significant, archaeological discoveries of this century. The implications of the piece are clear: for at least I50,000 years, and perhaps as long as 300,000 years (Marshack I975: 87), the tradition of engraving marks on artefacts has been an integral part of the pre-human and human intellectual endowment. It does not seem impossible that over such a vast span of time the marks, although remaining similar, may by Magdalenian times have acquired a different and more complex significance than they had during the Acheulean phase. The rigid Palaeolithic-Mesolithic-Neolithic schema is more of a liability than an asset to prehistory and to archaeology. James Mellaart has pointed out that the term 'Palaeo- lithic', although it is in many respects obsolete, is still in use (I967: 15); the Palaeolithic archaeologist D. R. Theocaris considers the term to be without 'real content' (1973: 19). We use the word Palaeolithic as a sort of shorthand for a society that lives by hunting and gathering, that is aceramic, that has no domesticated animals, that does not engage in any form of agriculture, and that is, above all else, illiterate. The excavations at Dolni Vestonice and at Pavlov (Klima 1952 and 1954) have demonstrated that Upper Palaeolithic hunters broke the imaginary ceramic barrier ten thousand years before the first ceramic ware appeared in the eastern Mediterranean region (Leroi-Gourhan 967: 303) on a artefact or on a If we were to come upon the following marks, / on a mobiliary artefact or on a cave wall, we would in all likelihood dismiss them as an Upper Palaeolithic abstract sign. The three marks,4/, ,J and z, all figure in Leroi-Gourhan's typologies. Trlhe other, T, is a variant of the mark to its right. These marks are not a Franco-Cantabrian sequence; they are an inscription in Linear A on a Boeotian vase from Orchomenos (Jensen I969: 127; Diringer I968: 59). Two Upper Italian inscriptions ,7 ' and //I t//i(Fabretti I867: Tab. V, I) are as simple and brief as any of the sequences in figs 6, 7, 8. Figure I I contains five Franco-Cantabrian sequences; these are in the left-hand column. Opposite them are four inscriptions in written languages, and a set of marks (fig. i ij) on a pre- historic Egyptian pot which are not at present regarded as writing, although they seem to have the characteristics of an inscription. The similarities between the sequences of marks and the early inscriptions are unmistakable. Leroi-Gourhan has said that 'chronologically speaking, the mere fifteen thousand years that separate Lascaux men from ourselves make them part of our own epoch' (1967: 33). This assertion links modern men with Lascaux men on the basis of an essentially trivial coincidence of geological time: both groups belong to the Hlolocene period, whereas earlier Franco-Cantabrians - the Aurignacians and Perigordians - lived at the very end of the Pleistocene period immediately preceding the Hlolocene. Surely we can make a more meaningful statement about the relationship of Franco-Cantabrians to ourselves. In order to understand the nature of, for example, Magdalenian society, we must judge their art not merely in terms of Upper Palaeolithic art, but also in terms of our own.</page><page sequence="21">362 Allan Forbes, 7r. and Thomas R.

Not until the second millennium B.C., for example, in Egypt and at Knossos, do we find painting that is technically superior to works at Altamira, Niaux, and Lascaux. Attic vase painting of the sixth and fifth cen- turies is two-dimensional and chromatically far less interesting than the great cave frescoes. Franco-Cantabrian artists, as Graziosi has commented (I960: 92), conducted experiments in perspective, compared with which the efforts of red-figure vase painters to solve the same problem are ludicrous. But we are concerned with conceptual parallels, not with technical questions. Let us compare two Magdalenian and two Greek works as to morphological and conceptual relationships. A Magdalenian engraving (plate I a) depicts, according to most authorities, a realistic scene of stags crossing a river in which salmon are jumping. A painting on a late eighth- century Greek Geometric amphora (plate lib) shows a man standing at the head of a horse. The similarities of the two images are obvious. The fish beneath the body of the centre stag leaps upwards directly at the stag's genitals almost exactly as does the fish underneath the horse. The stag at the left of the engraving has two lozenges above its back; the horse on the amphora has three lozenges above its back. The meaning of the Magdalenian engraving is unknown, although prehistorians agree that it must have a specific significance (Laming I962: I20; Leroi-Gourhan 1967: 69). The vase painting has associations with Greek cults of death, the principal iconographic symbols of which are horses and fish. In the images that celebrate such cults, the horse is usually accompanied by fish under its body pointing upwards or under its neck (Schweit- zer 1971: 54, 62). The Magdalenian engraving meets both these conditions. If we are eventually to decipher Franco-Cantabrian art, our interpretive efforts must go beyond</page><page sequence="22">The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs: agenda for a new approach 363 the simplistic view that works such as this are merely naturalistic. A few prehistorians are now beginning to take this sort of position (Caralp, Nougier, and Robert 1973: 23). While we cannot dismiss the probability that the astonishing parallels between the Magdalenian engraving and the vase painting are fortuitous, we cannot automatically rule out any possibility that the engraving may reflect Magdalenian notions about life and death. A comparison of a Magdalenian painting of the so-called Sorcerer at Les Trois Freres (plate IIc) with an Attic red-figured vase painting of a silen or satyr (plate I d), shows not merely striking morphological parallels, but a precise conceptual parallel as well. Both figures have equine ears and tails; both are ithyphallic, although in different ways. The Sorcerer's human identity is indicated by his feet; the animal-like character of the human silen is shown by his paw-like hands, as well as his tail and ears. These two paint- ings, although they are separated by perhaps Io,ooo years and by the vast cultural abyss between the Upper Paleolithic period and classical Athens, make the same statement: man is both an animal and a man, and they make it in the same way, using the same symbolism. The later Franco-Cantabrians must be a part of our own epoch, not merely chronologically, but intellectually and psychologically as well. For a century or more the decipherment of Franco-Cantabrian art has been the major item of unfinished business on the agenda of archaeology and prehistory. It is now time for a concerted effort to interpret the abstract signs and to determine the nature of their relationship to representational images. This will require verification of all reproductions of sequences, the accuracy of many of which is open to question because of the difficulties of photography (Leroi-Gourhan I967: 394). A painstaking search of parietal sites for sequences that may have escaped notice is also necessary. The task is one of considerable magnitude. However, no other enterprise in archaeology seems to hold greater promise. After examining Bordes' ox rib, Marshack made this comment: 'If my analytic results are correct, they may change our concept not only of the origins of art and symbol making, but of the intellectual and cultural evolution of Homo sapiens' (1975: 85). What is potentially at stake is nothing less than a dramatic and sweeping new understanding of both prehistory and history.

The problem of Franco-Cantabrian abstract signs: agenda for a new approach Franco-Cantabrian art, mobiliary and parietal, contains a large number of highly enigmatic abstract signs and complex sequences of marks. Although there is general agreement among prehistorians and archaeologists that these signs and marks are meaningful, there is no plausible theory as to their significance. The marks show close correspondences with marks at other Paleolithic sites and also at Neolithic sites throughout the world. Extremely close correspon- dences exist between Franco-Cantabrian marks and the signs, characters, and letters in ancient written languages from the Mediterranean, the Indus Valley, and China. The sequences seemD not to be owner's marks, maker's marks or mnemonic devices. The paper proposes that a concerted effort to determine the significance of the signs and marks should be made now.</page></plain_text>
