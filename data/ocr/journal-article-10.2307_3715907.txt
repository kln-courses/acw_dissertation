He does less than justice to Werther which is definitely something more than a pathological novel and reflects the feelings and aspirations of an age, and he is inclined to over-estimate Wilhelm Meister because it is the antithesis of Werther and preaches renunciation 'instead of false national feeling.' Gotz is praised as the 'source of the modern historical romance,' but Faust is only mentioned twice, and that cursorily, in the course of these pages, while there is practically no reference to the lyrical poems. Mr Felkin is scarcely at home in the latest developments of German criticism although he quotes frequently and aptly from older critics like the Schlegels, Gervinus and Scholl. (But who is Paul Klaucke? and what a strange bedfellow is Herman Merivale to Kuno Fischer!) Mr Felkin is stimulating in the analysis of Goethe's poetic genius, and his obviously wide knowledge and intuitive appreciation of poetry make his analyses of Iphigenie and Tasso good reading. But he is too intent on claiming all that is great in Goethe to Classical influence to merit the consideration which a less one-sided view of literature would deserve. L. A. WILLOUGHBY. LONDON.

Mohr. xvi + 544 pp. 21 M. Encouraged no doubt by the philosophical turn that German literary studies have taken in recent years, philosophers are venturing more and more frequently on domains that used to be considered the preserves of the Germanist. That such work can be very valuable was proved long ago by Dilthey and Simmel. The books which the philosophers Franz and Rickert have published for the Goethe centenary prove once more how valuable the habit of precise thinking and a philosophical background are, especially if they are combined, as they are in these two writers, with a full knowledge of the older philological methods and results. As com- pared with literary studies of the older type, both lay more stress on synthesis, on the search for an underlying unity in Goethe's work and thought, and both have hard things to say sometimes about the abuses of the 'historical' method and its often rather arbitrary distinctions between the work of different periods. They insist on the necessity of avoiding a too literal interpretation of their author, of reading every statement in its context and of interpreting a work as far as possible through the text itself and not through what happens to be known about its history. These ideas are of course commonplaces of the now fashionable 'Geistesgeschichte,' but its exponents do not always produce work as solid and as clearly written as these two volumes. The guiding principles of the work of Franz, laid down in his preface, are that a more critical use must be made of the sources, that Goethe</page><page sequence="2">must be taken seriously as a philosopher and that he must be regarded, not as a 'representative man,' but as an extremely complex personality. After an introductory chapter discussing Goethe's claims to consideration as a thinker, his personality, the history of his religious experience and the relative value of his various writings bearing on religion, Franz boldly faces the difficulty of the complexity of Goethe's mind in a long chapter headed 'Religion und Ironie.' He describes Goethe as 'seelisch dif- ferenziert, ironisch iiberlegen, geistig aristokratisch' and brings out the unique character of his religious thought by a 'phenomenological' survey of the many attitudes to the world of values that have been adopted by different men at different times, ranging from devoted belief, through respectful understanding, to that ironical playing with alternative systems of ideas that he looks upon as typically Romantic. Goethe's was not an age when any traditional religion could be accepted by a man like him in simple faith, and though he understood and respected the fundamental truth that he considered all developed religions to contain, his reserve where his deepest beliefs were concerned, his sense of humour and his intellectual sprightliness often made him seem more ironical than he really was and brought him nearer to Wieland than to Schiller, whose 'Pathos' was quite foreign to him. In a survey of Goethe's ironical references to religion a masterly analysis of the Prometheus ode is par- ticularly noticeable. In the next chapter, 'Religion als Ehrfurcht,' we come to the core of Goethe's positive beliefs. A careful analysis of the famous chapters in the Wanderjahre reveals a most important body of ideas, here convincingly interpreted and freed from certain incidental obscurities. Subsequent chapters present Goethe's views on the psychology of religion, with a very illuminating study of what Goethe meant by 'Das Damonische,' on the history of religion, including a subtle analysis of the relevant passages in Dichtung und Wahrheit-passages which, according to Franz, give us Goethe's conception of the historical growth of religion rather than the history of his own development-and on the philosophy of religion. 'Die elementarste Voraussetzung fir das Verstindnis von Goethes Religions- philosophie,' says Franz, 'ist die Erkenntnis, dass er eine absolute und relative Betrachtung des Gottlichen sorgfiiltig unterscheidet.' Nature and life are at bottom, regarded 'absolutely,' utterly mysterious, but there is a place for a 'relative' view, such as is suggested for instance in the ode Das G6ttliche, even though its anthropomorphism must be con- sidered a purely symbolic, not a literal truth. The close analogy with Goethe's theory of knowledge, his view of truth as that which is fruitful, that which makes experience 'kopfrecht' for us, is insisted upon. One is reminded too of this distinction between the absolute and the relative when later in the book Goethe's 'optimism' is described as being 'von unten her,' the attitude of a man who, while entertaining no comfortable illusions, would make the best of 'Vernunft und Wissenschaft' and all that life can offer. It is the expression, one might say, not of a belief about the nature of existence so much as of an attitude of the will or of a natural buoyancy of temperament. 128 Reviews</page><page sequence="3">The comparisons between Goethe and other German thinkers which are a feature of the book culminate in a consideration of the relation in which present-day thought stands to Goethe. Nietzsche's philosophy of religion is described as 'ein Vergrosserungsspiegel, in welchem die feineren Linien der Goetheschen Gedanken weit starker und scharfer hervortreten, eben darum manches aber verzerrt erscheint.' This work of Franz, one may say, is very clearly post-Nietzschean. Nietzsche has helped us to understand Goethe. Franz considers that Goethe anticipated the essential feature of the 'dialectic theology' of the school of Barth, its feeling for the 'mysterium tremendum.' 'Er hiitet sich aber sorgfaltig vor der schweren Verirrung, die darin liegt, dass fir dies unbekannte X nun mit einer verbliiffenden Kritiklosigkeit die ganze Erbmasse der biblischen und dogmatischen Uberlieferung eingesetzt wird.' In the philosophy of religion, the author thinks, we have still much to learn from the German classics. In a short concluding chapter on 'Goethes persinlicher Glaube' his 'Naturverbundenheit' is singled out as the outstanding feature of his thought and feeling; his 'Weltfrommigkeit,' his repudiation of any religion that separates value from existing reality is once more insisted upon and his recorded views on the immortality of the soul and on the belief in providence are interpreted in a way which makes them consistent with the rest of his beliefs. It will be seen that the range of this book is very wide. It is well planned, clearly written and well documented. The author faces every issue with complete honesty. This book takes us to the centre of Goethe's thought and personality and fills us with admiration for his wisdom and insight. Professor Rickert sets out to enquire how far Goethe was right in thinking that his completed Faust was a real whole, and in particular whether Faust possesses dramatic unity in the sense that there is a single theme for the action of both parts. He is not content with the genetic explanations of Faust in the light of Goethe's personal development, conceived, as it was, by the historical school, rather melodramatically. He thinks that the completed work, read as it stands, possesses far more unity than is commonly thought. Its central theme is stated in the 'Prolog im Himmel.' It is, in brief, to justify the ways of man. The novelty of Rickert's treatment lies in his interpretation of certain central scenes, the pact scene, for instance, and the concluding scenes of Part II (some of these chapters have appeared in periodicals), and in his vision of the work as a whole, of the underlying unity in all the variations of Faust's character that are revealed as the drama proceeds. It becomes apparent that Goethe does not mean all our sympathies to be with Faust any more than with Tasso. Faust remains the 'Ubermensch' he was at the beginning, but Rickert sees three stages in the action, leading naturally one to the other, the 'Gretchentragodie,' the 'Helenatrag6die' and the 'Herrschertrag6die.' In each stage Faust's wilfulness leads him into morally indefensible actions, but his energy remains unbroken and his guilt itself purifies him. There are many difficulties. 'Wald und H6hle' is a crux, with its Reviews 129 Mo.L, R. XXVIII 9</page><page sequence="4">'Erhabener Geist,' who, Rickert insists, is not the Erdgeist. If he were, and Mephistopheles were his emissary, we should be obliged to give up all hope of reconciling this scene with the' Prolog im Himmel' and abandon the attempt to find dramatic unity in Faust as a whole. But Rickert urges that the few phrases here and in the scene 'Triiber Tag, Feld' which have suggested the Erdgeist hypothesis have been given too much weight, that the interrelations of the supernatural beings in Faust were not logically thought out but rightly left vague. One might say too, taking a hint from what Franz tells us of Goethe himself, that when Faust feels the need for prayer he does not choose a name for 'der ewig Ungenannte' with the precision of a theologian. 'Es kommt Goethe gar nicht darauf an, ob er "Gott" oder "Natur" sagt, "Schicksal" oder "himmlischer Vater," ob er sagt "die Gotter" oder-nach Fichtes Atheismusstreit-"die moralische Weltordnung." In jedem Falle ist damit dasselbe gemeint.' The Helena tragedy provides another difficulty. Here, according to Rickert, Euphorion has to take his father's place for the moment as the centre of interest. It is his 'Masslosigkeit' which brings the dream of beauty to an end. But these and other difficulties are inherent in the task that Professor Rickert has undertaken, and his commentary on the thought content of the drama is, in spite of them, the most complete and helpful that has yet appeared. In form it is close to the lectures from which it originated. It is a long book, not so tightly packed with matter as that of Franz, but more easily read. W. H. BRUFORD. EDINBURGH.

Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press; London: H. Milford. ix + 274 pp. $ 3.00. Professor Edwin H. Zeydel, whom we associate particularly with work on Tieck in America, has given us a comprehensive and furthering book on Tieck's relations to England. The field has not hitherto been covered as a whole, and Professor Zeydel does so with exemplary thoroughness, utilising a good deal of unpublished material. His in- vestigations are grouped under the headings 'Tieck and English Litera- ture,' ' Tieck in England,' 'English Visitors and Correspondents,' 'Tieck's Library' and 'The Appreciation of Tieck and his Writings in England.' Quite new ground is broken in the last of these sections, a particularly interesting contribution to Anglo-German literary relations. Professor Zeydel also gives us a good summary of Tieck's participation in Schlegel's Shakespeare translation. I offer a few comments which have occurred 130 Reviews</page></plain_text>
