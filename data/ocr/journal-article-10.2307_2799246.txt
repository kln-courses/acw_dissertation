<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAVALLEE, DANIELE. Les representations ani- males dans la ceramique mochica (Mem. Inst. Ethnol. Paris 4). 318 pp., illus., maps, bibliogr. Paris: Institut d'Ethnologie, 1970 This monograph involves analysis of some 1,634 Moche (Mochica) ceramic specimens from museum collections and published sources, specimens portraying decorative motifs confined to a single aspect of Moche art-animal representations. Four categories of such art are thus recognised: 1) natural- istic representations of the fauna; 2) repre- sentations of man utilising this fauna; 3) the various ' monsters' created by man's imagin- ation; and 4) geometric motifs inspired by the fauna. About 100 plates of useful line-cut illustrations complement the text. In dealing with art analysis Lavallee treats the animal representations in relation to the natural environment and the realm of the supernatural, discussing the supernatural representations of animal species and specu- lating on their symbolic role. In treating the natural environment the author attempts to effect zoological classification of the various fauna, tracing them to their respective habitats, e.g., marine, river valley, desert, or mountain zone. The cultural significance of certain of these ecological associations is noted, e.g., the near-absence of the jaguar in the natural area of Moche culture despite its predominance in Moche art. The discussion of supernatural sources for motifs merits special attention since cultural implications are drawn. Thus analysis is offered of various anthropomorphic and zoomorphic 'mon- sters', including the highly frequent feline motif which the author not unexpectedly derives from Chavtn sources (but ultimately from a tropical-forest habitat), attributing the resemblances between the two art styles to a continuity in the Moche culture of Chavin religious elements. The monograph obviously represents a great deal of research, suggesting a broad command by Lavallee of the pertinent archaeological and ethnological literature. A high standard of scholarship based on com- parative analysis of art and myth motifs in the Americas is therefore evident, as demonstrated by the methodologically clever treatment of themes as complex as the 'god in the boat' motif (pp. 102-111) depicted in Plate 57. This work constitutes a positive contribution to Peruvian art history and archaeology. L. R.. V. JOESINK-MANDEVILLE</page></plain_text>
