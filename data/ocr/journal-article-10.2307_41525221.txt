<plain_text><page sequence="1">Agonia, Indigetes, and the Breeding of Sheep and Goats I. Introduction : Gestation Cycles and the Prehistoric Roman Calendar In three earlier articles, I have developed the hypothesis that there was a primitive Roman year of 4 months ( uide A. J. Ph., 80, 2, p. 133- 149) based on the gestation cycle of pigs ( uide A.J.Ph ., 84, p. 28-35) with New Year festivities on the Caprotine Nones which, in that early period, occurred in March and represented the original Parilia (uide T.A.P.A. , 91, p. 109-119). The historical Parilia of April 21 does not appear to have been what I call a ferial day in the primitive calendar, yet this festivity and the Lupercalia (February 15 in the historical calendars) have all the marks of being very old indeed. Professor Latte (1) has recently noted their rusticity by listing them together with the Faunalia rustica of December 5 as Hirtenfeste or shepherds' festivals ; and this rusticity, I think, is a matter of time as well as place. They carry us back to a time when, as Ovid (Fasti, II, 295-298) says in speaking of the Lupercalia , the taurus and equus were not in use, only the ouis (2). The prominence of the smaller domestic animals in the earliest phases of Roman religion - and especially in the calendar - is suf- ficient evidence that the primitive economy was pretty well domi- nated by husbandry of this kind. On every nundinae or market-day, the fiammica Dialis offered a ram to Jove (cf. Macrobius, Sat., I, 16, 30) ; her husband, the flamen Dialis, offered some kind of sheep to Jove on the Ides of each month (cf. Macrobius, Sat., I, 16, 16 ; Ovid, Fasti, I, 55 ; I, 587-588) ; the regina sacrorum offered a pig or lamb to luno on the Kalends of each month (cf. Macrobius, Sat., I, 16, 19) ; and other specific sacrifices of pigs, goats, or sheep are too (1) K. Latte, Römische Religionsgeschichte , Munich, 1960, p. 83-89. (2) The taboo on horses at Aricia (cf. Ovid, Fasti, III, 266), the holiday for horses and asses at the Consualia (cf. Plutarch, Q.R., 48), and the prohibition of beastdrawn vehicles at the Septimontium (cf. Plutarch, Q.R., 69) may date from a similar period.</page><page sequence="2">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 317 numerous to mention. I have traced elsewhere {uide T.A.P.A. , loc. cit.) the connection of pigs and goats with the Caprotine Nones and with the famous twin legend. I propose here to examine the Parilia , the Lupercali a, and various Agonia in relation to the breeding of sheep and goats. It appears to me that sheep, goats, and pigs were all there when the original calendar was established ; however, pigs were most impor- tant and swineherds had an upper hand in the allotment of 4 months ( uide A.J.Ph ., 84, loc. cit.) to a calendar year. Goats became increa- singly important, as reflected in changes involving the Caprotine Nones ; and I would even hazard a guess that the nundinal or week- day system was based on the processing of goat-cheese (cf. Columella, VII, 8, 5). I have found no other product of the ancient world which took 8 days to prepare, and no doubt market-day intervals are re- lated to the periodic appearance of some staple commodity. More- over, sheep were of some interest if the fiammica Dialis sacrificed a ram on every market-day. What we have then is a calendar fitted to the breeding of pigs and to the marketing of cheese, but that is all. In the case of the Caprotine Nones, we can see how goatherds usurped a swineherd festival ; but in general a 4-month year was very awkward for goatherds and shepherds whose animals bred on a 5- month cycle. Varro makes the gestation period of the sheep 150 days ( R.R. , II, 2, 14) and says ( R . R.y II, 3, 8) that the goat bears post quartum mensem. A modern estimate (x) gives the sheep a variation of 143 to 159 days, with an average of 148 ; and the goat a variation of 145-157 days, with an average of 151. If the shepherds and goatherds tried to adapt these 5-month cycles to a 4-month year, there are some extremely interesting corollaries for the calendar and for the festivals under discussion. To begin with, the number 150 - unlike the number 120 - is not a multiple of 8, so a cycle of 150 days begun on a nundinal F day (2) would not end on a nundinal F day but on some day which then required lettering. Here then we may have our first explanation of lettering other days in the Roman week. There are other implications for particular fes- tivals ; let us start with the Caprotine Nones where some indication of usurpation by goatherds is already evident. (1) Encyclopedia Britannica , s.v. gestation, X, 1965, p. 372. (2) My view is that the original calendar consisted only of nundinae feriae , all marked F (i uide A.J.Ph., 80, loc. cit.).</page><page sequence="3">318 V.L. JOHNSON 2. First cycle : Caprotine Nones to Septimontium- AG. IND . In a 4-month year the Caprotine Nones would have come on March 6. If you bred pigs on this day, they would be born the follow- ing March, perhaps even on March 6, so this day, which I have proposed as the original Parilia , is both a breeding and a bearing day. However, if you breed goats or sheep on this day, they are going to be born in April of the following 4-month year. A span of exactly 150 days would take us to the Faunalia rustica which fell on December 5 in historical times but which would have fallen on April 6 in a 4- month year ; and indeed, from what little we know of that festival, its origin may lie here : Servius (in Georg ., I, 10) quotes Cincius Ali- mentus as associating Faunus with Evander and the Palatine (the site of the Parilia) ; and this interpretation would perhaps give new and pointed meaning to a clause of Horace (Carm., Ill, 18, 5) regard- ing the Faunalia : Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno . However, a more likely terminus for this gestation cycle is the fes- tival (or festivals) (1) which came on December 1 1 in historical times and is marked Agonalia and Septimontium in the extant calendars. This would have occurred on April 12 in a 4-month year, concluding a period of 156 days from March 6. What we know of this festival indicates that it was very old indeed and that it was, like the Parilia , connected with a Palatine community. Plutarch (Q.R., 69), as cited above, ascribes to this day a taboo on beast-drawn vehicles ; Varro (Z,.Z.,V 1, 24) calls the Septimontium a festival of the montani ; and Festus (474 L) records an offering called the Palatuar made by the flamen Palatualis . Varro ( L . Z., V, 41) identifies the Septimontium in a geo- graphical sense with Rome ; and present views (2) of the Septimontium as a stage in the city's growth identify it largely with the Palatine and Esquiline hills. The meaning of agonium I shall leave until later in this discussion, since I shall then have demonstrated that all four agonia listed in the extant calendars may have been the termini of gestation cycles for pigs, sheep, and goats. The abbreviations AG. IN. registered in the calendar of Amiternum (C./.L., IX, 4192 ; Degrassi, /./., XIII, 2, no. 25, p. 198-199) against the day in ques- (1 ) I find no reason to reject Mommsen's view that the Agonalia and Septimontium, were connected festivals, but see A. Degrassi, XIII, 2, p. 536 for opposing views. (2) Cf. A. Momigliano, Interim Report on the Origins of Rome in J.R.S., LIII, 1963, p. 95-121.</page><page sequence="4">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 319 tion (December 11) were taken by Mommsen to mean Agonium Imi. This is now disproven by a new fragment found at Ostia in 1921 and published as C.I.L. IV, 4547 (Degrassi, XIII, 2, no. 16, p. 106). The Ostia fragment clearly reads AG. IND. which the editors take for Agonium Indigeti (x). Degrassi (op. cit., p. 536) and others think that Indiges is Sol Indiges , but I see no evidence for this beyond a weak passage in Lydus (De Mens., IV, 155). Moreover, I see no reason against supposing that IND. in the Ostia fragment is an abbreviation for Indigetibus , the plural (uide Degrassi, op. cit., Tab. XXXII). For my interpretation of indiges , see below. The next point after the Caprotine Nones, when sheep and goat raisers might have usurped a breeding day set by swineherds, would have been some day in the middle of May ( uide A. J. Ph., 84, loc. cit.). May 10 would have been a ferial day in the 4-month year ( uide A.J. Ph., 80, loc. cit.) ; and this is a day on which the historical agonium of January 9 might have fallen. I am inclined to think it did, and that it constituted the second breeding day for pigs. Like the Capro- tine Nones, it might also have been a bearing day for pigs. But I can find no evidence that it ever became a breeding day for goats and sheep : there is no festival, according to the shifts which I recog- nize, which might have terminated a 150-day cycle which began on May 10. 3. Second cycle: Parilia-Consualia-Diualia-fLarentalia?) to Agonium But another 150-day cycle seems to begin a few weeks before this, viz. with the familiar Parilia of April (historically, April 21 ; in a 4- month year, April 22) ; and this is extremely interesting : it looks to me like a clear attempt to put a gestation cycle for sheep and goats squarely in the middle of two 120-day years. This 150-day cycle would terminate with the Agonium recorded for May 2 1 in the extant calendars and falling on May 20 in a 4-month year. By our calcula- tion, the period from April 22 to May 20 of the following 4-month year is actually 148 days, but Roman arithmetic would have made it 149 days and perhaps 150, since it appears to be divided in half by the intervening Caprotine Nones. In other words there are 74 days from April 22 to March 6 (75 by Roman calculation) and 74 days from March 6 to May 20 (again 75 by Roman calculation). Whatever the (1) Cf. H. Wagenwoort, Roman Dynamism , Oxford, 1947, p. 101-102.</page><page sequence="5">320 V. L. JOHNSON exact total in such sums, the important fact is that the Caprotine Nones falls exactly in the middle of the whole period. This cannot be accidental, I think : I have noted nothing else like it in all my com- putations. If it was intentional, then I think we have for the first time a likely explanation of why the familiar Parilia came at the seemingly unlikely time of April 22 or April 21 in historical times. The connection of April 22 and May 20 as the termini of a gesta- tion cycle is rendered plausible by the fact that an agonium once more terminates such a period, and by the amazing coincidence that rites to Vediouis were held on the same day as this agonium ( vide Fasti Venu- siani apud , /./., XIII, 2, no. 6, p. 55-67, esp. p. 57). The rites of Ve- diouis on the Nones of March I have already (uide T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit.) brought into conjunction with the Caprotine Nones as the ori- ginal Parilia , so it is convincing to associate these May rites for Ve- diouis with the historical Parilia of April. In this last case, of course, Vediouis is concerned only with the termination of a gestation cycle ; but if there is an analogy between the Parilia and the Caprotine Nones, he may have been connected with the beginning of this cycle as well. 4. Vediouis For Vediouis as a year-god, see my article Natalis Urbis and Princi - pium Anni ( T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit., especially page 110 with note 5). The name Vediouis appears in three forms : Vediouis , Vëdiiouis , and Vëdius ; the first appears to be correct since it appears, though muti- lated by a stonecutter in antiquity, in an early inscription from Bovil- lae ( vide H. Dessau, I.L.S. 2988). Variant spellings in the base of the word are themselves evidence that the ancients saw a reference to Jove in this part of the word, and we are not ready to dispute it. The prefix uë-, however, is another matter : the e is clearly long in Ovid's verses {Fasti, III, 429-448), and Ovid interprets the prefix as the privative uë - found in such words as uegrandis and uescus. He thus explains Vediouis as a little Jupiter, and in the article cited above I have given reasons for thinking that his conclusion is right : Vedio- uis is probably the young Jupiter who starts the year. The « year», however, is a gestation cycle for animals, and this suggests a new ety- mology for the prefix uZ- in the name Vediouis : I am inclined to think that it has nothing to do with the uë- in uegrandis , uescus , uecors , etc. It appears to me most likely that the long ë in Vediouis is not a natu- ral quantity but the result of combination. This could have hap-</page><page sequence="6">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 321 pened in different ways, depending on the sounds of the original pre- fix, but I find the following explanation particularly appropriate to the known attributes of Vediouis. Vetus , the Latin adjective for « old », is really an old neuter noun cognate with Sanskrit vatsas and Greek ëroç meaning « year » {uide C. D. Buck, Comp . Gram . Greek and Latin , p. 210 ; Lewis and Short, New Latin Diet ., s. v. uetus). This word, I would suggest, is the source of the prefix uë- in Vediouis . If the s in uetus was part of the root, viz. vets - as the Sanskrit indicates - it was lost in combination before the voiced consonant d in Diouis (i uide C. D. Buck, op, cit . p. 149). The t was then assimilated to the d of Diouis , yielding a double con- sonant dd which was later reduced to a single consonant d with atten- dant lengthening of the preceding vowel e . The meaning of the word was « year-Jove», and the year-Jove, I am convinced, was pro- bably represented by some « yearling » animal. Vitulus , the Latin word for « bullock », also comes from the root uetus and, like Sanskrit vatsáh , really means « yearling » ( uide A. Ernout and A. Meillet, Diet. Etym. Lang . Lat., s. v. uetus). Whether or not the Itali were so-called because they worshipped a uitulus ( vide F. Altheim, Studi e Materiali , 10, 1934, p. 125-155), the ancient derivation of Italus from uitulus (cf. Gellius, XI, 1, 1) is probably correct and indicates the importance of the « yearling» in primitive Italian cult. It is assumed by most writers, ancient and modern, that this ui- tulus was always bovine, and indeed etymology takes us no further ; but I am inclined to believe that, semantically, the Indo-European root was general and not specific. There is a whole group of « ani- mal » words in Latin - with cognates in Greek and Sanskrit - which refer to animals, particularly male animals, and which con- tain similar, though not exactly identifiable, roots : uerres , « boar » (cf. Sanskrit uTshabha , «bull»); ueruex , berbex , ( h)aruix , and aries, « ram » (cf. Greek faqr¡v, Fcjlqvóç , agrjv, aQQr¡v9 « lamb », egicpoç « kid », and sXacpoç , « stag ») aruiga , «ram for offering » ; ama « lamb » ; uitulus , « bullock » (cf. Aeolic ëraXov) ; and perhaps the strange verb ueruago , « to plough », with some connotation about draught animals used in ploughing. It may well be that the root of all these words meant « yearling » in the Indo-European mother tongue, and that in derivative languages the « yearling » was specified according to the husbandry of the speakers involved. For an analogy, see my ar- gument on (&lt; c)aper , xangóç in The Prehistoric Roman Calendar ( A.J.Ph ., 84, loc. cit., esp. p. 31 with note|6).</page><page sequence="7">322 v. L. JOHNSON If the Roman « yearling» was any male animal common to the husbandry of early Italy, I would suggest that it was aper , caper, aries , or uitulus - perhaps all of them at different times and probably in the order listed, since the Roman calendar seems to have started with rites performed by swineherds, goatherds, and shepherds (see my two articles cited above). In that case Vediouis , if he took animal shape - as is likely (cf. my remarks on Caprotina and the two Pa- les, T.A.P.A. , loc. cit., pp. 117-1 19) - was probably a boar or a billy- goat, to start with; maybe a ram or a bullock before he reached the anthropomorphic stage. However, the « bullock » connections of Jove may have hastened that phase of development. Actually, of course, we know only that Vediouis was represented as a young man with a she-goat ; but here we are discussing things which took place long before artistic representation of any kind. 5. Parilia- Consualia-Diualia ( Lar entalia? ) If the historical Parilia began a gestation cycle, we have a new ex- planation of the phrase PRINCIPIO AN against this date in the Fasti of Praeneste (C.I.L., I2, 236 ; /./., no. 17, p. 107-145, esp. 130- 131). I have previously argued ( uide T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit.) that this phrase, completed as PRINCIPIO ANNI, was borrowed from the Caprotine Nones ; and now my argument seems to be strengthened if the historical Parilia is, like the Caproline Nones, the beginning of a gestation cycle. In addition to my own statistics, as recounted above, Ovid's language at one point {Fasti, IV, 771-772), where he is para- phrasing the shepherd's Parilia prayer, particularly supports this view that the historical Parilia began a gestation cycle : sitque salax aries , conceptaque semina coniunx reddat , et in stabulo multa sit agna meo. Other aspects of the Parilia are later accretions, I would imagine, especially the rites of purification (cf. Ovid, Fasti , IV, 721-782) which became most prominent, or perhaps began, when the Parilia no longer started a breeding cycle. The suffimen - made from the blood of the October horse, the ashes of the calves burned at the Fordicidia , and bean stalks - probably belongs to this later period though the Fordicia was an F day in the 4-month year ; it is possible that uitulus (cf. Ovid, Fasti , IV, 733 and see my remarks on Vediouis above) once denoted other animals than cows ; and the ashes of an unborn animal may well have been connected with a fertility rite</page><page sequence="8">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 323 performed at breeding time for animals of another species. This line of thought would lend further credence to the view that the original core of rites at the Parilia involved the beginning of a breed- ing cycle. The participation of the Rex sacrorum (cf. Dion. Hal., I, 88) may or may not be a later development (1). Other primitive aspects of the historical Parilia are revealed by the fact that, if it existed in the calendar of a 4-month year, it coincided, or may have coincided, with the Consualia of August 22 (historically August 21) and with that puzzling festival, the Diualia of December 22 (historically December 21). A juxtaposition with the Consualia is extremely plausible, since Consus was also worshipped on the Ca- protine Nones ( uide T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit.). Moreover, there was at the Consualia of August a taboo on the practical use of horses and asses (cf. Plutarch Q. Ä., 48) (2) - not unlike that in effect at the Septimontium ( uide supra) ; and the rape of the Sabine women, which I have analyzed ( uide T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit.) as a duplication of the an- cillarum feriae on the Caprotine Nones, is said (cf. Varro, L.L. , VI, 20 ; Dion. Hal., II, 31) to have taken place at the Consualia of Au- gust. These tales of rape would seem to have sprung quite naturally from rituals connected with a breeding day like the Caprotine Nones or the Parilia. A prehistoric coincidence of the Parilia of April with the Diualia of December is even more intriguing. It would explain at once an- other apparent reference to a « year » or to the « beginning of a year » at the Diualia , as well as at the Parilia , in the Fasti of Praeneste. De- grassi (op. cit., no. 17, p. 122, 138-139, 143, 145) has now assigned to March 15 the lost fragment which Mommsen added to the par- tially obliterated entry for December 21, the day of the historical Diualia , arguing quite rightly, I think, that the text for December 21 ends with the letter « m ». Mommsen's reconstruction of the entry (1) Varro (L.L., VI, 12 : cf. Ovro, Fasti, I, 317-336) says the rex sacrorum sacrificed a ram in the regia on the dies agonalis , presumably to Janus, since the rex was regularly his priest. This statement has been applied to all agonia , but I would think it true only for the agonium of May 10 (historically January 9) which occurred in Janus' month beginning with the calendar of Numa and remained there henceforth. (2) A. Degrassi {op. cit., p. 136-7 and ad loc. p. 500 and 538) now assigns this passage to December 15, since Verrius Flaccus in the Fasti Praenestini mentions horses on that day. However, the calendar fragment is not complete, nor do we have Flaccus' statement for August 21. In any case, I would assume that all rites for Consus were prehsitorically much the same.</page><page sequence="9">324 v. L. JOHNSON for December 21 must be rejected, but the mutilated text still leaves us with the letters M. AIUNT OB AN which Degrassi does not attempt to complete but which certainly may carry a reference to a « year », as Mommsen thought. And it may well be the « begin- ning of a year», if the Diualia at one time coincided with the princi - pium anni of April 21. A juxtaposition of the Diualia with the Parilia and the Consualia might also shed some light on the mysterious goddess, Angerona, who was worshipped at the Diualia . According to Pliny ( N.H. , III, 5, 65), the image of Angerona had its mouth bound and sealed. Varro (L. L ., VI, 23) places her rites in the curia Acculeia ; Macrobius (Sat.9 I, 10, 7), more exactly, in the sacellum Volupiae (x) which Varro (Z.L., V, 164) puts in the Via Noua in the Velabrum area just below the Palatine. Varro ( L . Z,., VI, 24) likewise tells us that the tomb of Acca, the foster-mother of Romulus and Remus, was in this same area. Acca's festival, the Larentalia , came just two days after the Diua- lia (December 23) in historical times ; and I expect that we should add Acca to our considerations here : the shift from a 4-month ca- lendar to the calendar of Romulus might have displaced her festival by two days due to the addition of July 31 and October 31 in the transitional year. Inclusion of the Larentalia in this cluster of festivals is supported by Plutarch's odd statement (Q.Ä., 35) that Acca was honored in April (2). A coincidence of the Larentalia with a Consualia may be the source of Gellius' statement ( N.A. , VII, 7), that the flamen Quirinalis (the usual priest of Consus) took part in the ceremo- nies for Acca. Macrobius {loc. cit.) and Varro (. L.L. , VI, 23) are both vague in their references to the priesthoods involved at the Diualia and Larentalia respectively : Macrobius speaks of pontífices and Varro of sacerdotes. 6. Indigetes of the Agonium The pieces of this strange puzzle I would put together as follows. I would suggest that they are all connected with the beginning of a breeding cycle for goats and/or sheep, but especially sheep. The Parilia of April, like the original Parilia of the Capro tine Nones, con- (1) St. Augustine ( Ciu.Dei , IV, 8) mentions Volúpia as one numen of the indigitamenta. (2) There is no other evidence for a Larentalia in April, but see A. jjegrassi, op. cit., p. 544.</page><page sequence="10">Agonia, indigetes and the breeding of sheep And goats 325 sisted of rites for Pales, conducted by the flamen Palatualis , probably of rites for Vediouis , and of rites for Consus conducted by the flamen Quirinalis . In addition, rites were conducted by unspecified priests (unless pontífices in the passage from Macrobius is used in a technical sense) for Angerona. In antiquity i1) the name Angerona was clum- sily derived from words like angor and angina , and Angerona, for no good reason, was regarded as the goddess of healing. Mommsen (2), rejecting this interpretation, suggested a derivation from obsolete angerere , referring to a « rising up » of the sun at the winter solstice. If Angerona's rites came originally in the spring, as I have suggested, this cannot be true. In the name Angerona, I would see a reference to a different kind of «annual» event, viz., the beginning of a breeding cycle. Ernout-Meillet {op. cit., s. v. Angerona ) say that the word is« sans doute étrusque » ; I do not think so : I would suggest that the first « n » is secondary as in iungere from the root found in iugum ( uide A. Walde- J. B. Hofman, Lat . Et. Wort ., s. v. iungo ) ; *Agerona I would connect with agonium and with agnus , and take Ovid's word for it (. Fasti , I, 331-332) that agonium refers to some kind of animal, pecus , usually a sheep. Moreover, the « g » must have been written as a « с » before the third century В. C. (cf. Lewis-Short, op. cit ., s. v. G. g .), so Acca, with a hypocoristic doubling of this consonant ( uide Buck, op. cit ., p. 155-156 ; cf. Lewis-Short, op. cit., s. v. Acca and A. Ernout-A. Meil- let, op. cit., s. v. Acca) may be a by-form of Angerona. In this context, we should perhaps also reconsider the derivations of annus , indiges , and inguen. Annus is now generally derived from *at-nos (i uide C. D. Buck, op. cit., p. 147 and A. Walde-J. B. Hofmann, op. cit., s. v. annus), but the root appears as ac - in Umbrian acnu, a recognized cognate of annus. Indiges has never been properly ex- plained ( uide A. Ernout-A. Meillet, op. cit., s. v. indiges), but it seems to me that, in the medial syllable, we may have the same vowel change that we find, e. g., in *perfacio to *perfecio to perfido ( uide C. D. Buck, op. cit., p. 100, § 110, 1). This would give us an original ac as the second syllable, and imply that the indiges is connected with agonium, as I have indicated on other grounds in my discussion of the Septi- montium (i uide supra). The word inguen which originally meant mem- (1) E. g. Verrius Flaccus and Julius Modestus apud Macrobius, »Sto., I, 10, 7 and 9. (2) Vide A. Degrassi, op. cit., p. 541-542.</page><page sequence="11">326 V. L. JOHNSON brum uirile may contain the same secondary « n » that we have in Angerona and show the same shift from ac to ic (ig) that we have in indiges. Moreover, the Greek cognate of inguen, viz. àôijv, once ap- pears as âòrjv (A) and the aspirate may be evidence of a lost digamma in inguen ; if this is true, I would then connect inguen with the verbs uegere, uigere and perhaps with the noun uacca meaning « cow » : uac to uec (ueg) to uic ( uig ) (2) would give us the same series that we have to complete perfido above, and indicate that the animal origi- nally denoted by the root ac or Fac was not specified (cf. Ovid, loc. cit.). This is admittedly a tenuous reconstruction of the linguistic evi- dence, but I think it is more coherent than any so far provided ; and it fits a thesis which I have arrived at on other grounds. This thesis I would therefore expand to suggest that agonium - and perhaps annus - refers to a breeding cycle and that originally - as in the agonium of May 10 (January 9 historically) - it denoted both the beginning and the end of such a cycle. As new cycles were added, the word agonium was restricted to the end of the cycle, as at the Sep- timontium , the agonium of May 20 (May 21 historically) and the ago- nium of March (still to be discussed). An indiges then is a deity of the Agonium ; and at the Parilia of April, one of the indigetes was pro- bably Angerona and /or Acca, whose rites were performed in the curia Acculeia which no doubt took its name from the same root, ac. Angerona was worshipped in the sacellum Volupiae (3) and her image was bound and gagged. I would only guess at the meaning of this. May it not be that Angerona was originally sacrificed, like Caprotina at the Caprotine Nones (cf. T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit.) ? Since animals, as far as we know, were not bound and gagged for sacrifice, I would suggest that this dates from a time when a theriomorphic deity had taken human shape, and that the cries of this human shape were stifled before sacrifice or a symbolic sacrifice (4). In that case, Volúpia - in whose shrine the figure of Angerona stood - must re- ti) Aelujs Herodianus ô xexvixóç , éd. Aug. Lentz, I, 15, 1 ; 16, 4 ; 539, 20 ; II, 33 and 35.

Her name certainly has never been properly explained : the derivation from uolup, « pleasure » (Masurius apud Macrobius, Sat. , I, 10, 8), seems to be a piece of ancient nonsense. If she had the qualities which I would give her, might we not derive her name from the 1-Е root u¡p which gave us both uolpes and lupus in Latin ( uide J. Pokorný, Indoger . Et. Wort s. v. ulp-,lup-) ? In that case, she may be at first the wolf to which a lamb or goat is thrown (1), and later - in a benign aspect - Rumina, the foster mother of the twins (uide T.A.P.A. , 91, loc. cit.). This would certainly explain her association with a shrine not far from the tomb of Acca Larentia (uide supra) who was sometimes identified (2) with the lupa of the legend. 7. Third cycle : Luper calia to Liber alia, Agonium There remains one more agonium to be considered, viz., that which combined with the Liberalia of March 17 in the extant calendars. The date would have been March 16 in a 4-month year. Had a breed- ing cycle of approximately 5 months begun on this day, it would probably have terminated on April 12 or 22, the days of the Septimon - tium and Parilia respectively ; but it seems more likely to me, as I have indicated above, that the Septimontium ended a cycle begun on March 6, while the Parilia started a cycle ending on May 20. But March 16 could well have terminated a cycle which began in the last June but one : the festivals of June in the historical calendar do not appear right for this ; but the Lupercaliab which eventually fell on February 15, would have occurred on June 17 in a 4-month year, and certain aspects of this famous festival are best explained, it seems to me, by supposing that it was in its origin closely connected with a mating season of some kind. No doubt there were later developments in a festival which, for all its primitive elements, lasted into Imperial times as an important occasion ; and Professor Rose (Anc. Rom. Rei ., London, 1948, p. 57-58) may be quite right in believing that part of the ceremony was concerned with drawing a magic circle around the Palatine : Varro (L. L ., VI, 34), in a notoriously corrupt passage, mentions a lustra- tion, and the priests may have run a course which followed the pome - (1) Cf. Ovm, F asti y II, 85-86 for the proverbial opposition of lamb and wolf. (2) Vid. P.W., R.E. , 1, s. v. Acca .</page><page sequence="13">328 V. L. JOHNSON rium of the ancient city (Tac., Ann ., XII, 24). But almost everything else that we know about the Lupercalia connects it with fertility rites of some kind. The rites began at the Lupercal (Dion. Hal., I, 32, 5) where Romulus and Remus were supposed to have been nursed by the wolf. A she-goat (Ovid, Fasti , II, 361) or goats and a dog (Plu- tarch, Rom ., 21) were sacrificed to Faunus (Ovid, Fasti, II, 268) or to Inuus (Livy, II, 5) ; and the heads of two priests, no doubt Luperci or Creppi (Festus, 75 L), were smeared with the blood of sac- rifice and wiped with pieces of wool dipped in milk (Plutarch, loc. cit.) . A male goat was also sacrificed, and from its hide were made the thongs or amicula Iunonis (Ovid, Fasti, II, 443-446 ; Arnobius, II, 23) with which the Luperci , in their run, lashed out at women to induce fertility (Ovid, Fasti , II, 425-452). The priests were also clothed in the skins of the slaughtered victims (Val. Max., II, 2, 9). Finally, Ovid seems to quote [Fasti, II, 441) part of an archaic hymn which contained the startling clause Italidas matres... sacer hircus inito : this certainly refers to copulation, though I would ima- gine that Italidas is a corruption of *uitulas used in its primitive sense of «yearling» (see above on Vediouis). Much of this evidence cer- tainly points to the use of rituals appropriate to the beginning of a breeding cycle. Moreover, if these rituals were originally conducted in June rather than in February, we may have a better explanation (*) of the name given to one group of Luperci : they were called Fabii or Fabiani (Ovid, Fasti , II, 361 ff. ; C.I.L. , VI, 1933), and it is my opinion [uide A. J. Ph., 84, loc. cit.) that the month of June was originally called Fabarius. I would only ask if the other group, the Quinctilii, were named for the month of Quinctilis or July at some time when the calendar was readjusted. Ovid {Fasti, II, 282) says that the flamen Dialis was also involved in the rites of the Lupercalia ; and there is some doubt about this be- cause the flamen Dialis was subject to a taboo on she-goats (Gellius, X, 15, 2) and dogs (Plutarch, Q.R., 111). However, he wore a spe- cial hat called the albogalerus (Gellius, X, 16) and this seems to have been made from the skin of some white victim : since sheep and swine, or even he-goats, are not ruled out, I would think that the flamen's participation is legitimate but not original. His wife, the fiammica (1) The Fabii are usually associated with the gens Fabia which Livy (V,46) connects with the Quirinal Hill.</page><page sequence="14">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 329 Dialis , must have participated when the Lupercalia became a nundinal F day in the calendar of Numa II (aide A. J. Ph., 80, loc. cit.) ; and I would suggest that the flamerì s participation began then, or that Ovid has confused him with his wife or with the flamen Quirinalis {uide infra). I see no real evidence that Jupiter was originally involved in this festival. Faunus and Inuus, probably as equivalents for Vediouis and Con - stis-Liber ( uide infra), seem to be basic deities - perhaps indigites - of the Lupercalia ; and if the word lupercus comes from lupus { uide F. Altheim, Hist. Rom. Rei ., New York, 1937, p. 206-217), we have, as in the case of Volúpia , another reference to wolves and probably to a wolf god of some kind. But perhaps the most intriguing statement is that of Servius {in Aen ., VIII, 343) that Liber was a deity of the Luper- calia. The only substantiation of this unique comment is my sugges- tion that the Lupercalia began a breeding cycle which terminated on the Liberalia of March 16 (historically March 17) when Liber is ob- viously the chief object of worship in ceremonies which combine with those of an agonium. It looks to me as if Liber were another indiges , worshipped perhaps at both ends of this breeding cycle as the male element necessary to propagation ; hence no doubt Liber's ultimate identification with Mars (Macrobius, Sat., I, 19, 1-4) as maspiter (cf. Gellius, V, 12, 5) (x). This is probably why, according to Macro- bius {Sat., I, 4, 15) the priests ( pontífices ) called the day of the Liber- alia « agonium Martiale » (2), and why boys, according to Ovid {Fasti, III, 771 ff.) donned the toga uirilis on this day. It is interesting that once more human fertility got involved in ceremonies which origi- nated, in my opinion, with the propagation of animals ; compare the Lupercalia, the Parilia-Consualia, and the Caprotine Nones. It was no doubt this added element which kept all these festivals in use well past the time when swine or goats or sheep were bred on or near the Pa- latine. 8. The Breeding of Sheep and Goats I have suggested then that there were 3 breeding cycles for goats and for sheep in the prehistoric calendar : March 6 to April 12 of the (1) Cf. W. Warde-Fowler, Rom. Fest., London, 1899, p. 55 on the relation of Liber and genius. (2) Varro (L.L., VI, 14) says that the Liberalia was called Agonia in the books of Salii Agonenses . I am not ready to discuss the name of the Salii or their possible participation in agonia . 22</page><page sequence="15">330 v. L. JOHNSON following 4-month year, April 22 to May 20 of the following 4-month year, and June 17 to March 16 of the following 4-month year. It remains to see if these dates would actually fit breeding practices in Roman times, so far as we know them (1) . If we assume that these 4-month years followed one another in immediate succession, that 3 such years completed one solar year, and that normally March in the first 4-month year of the series corresponded roughly (2) with March of a solar year, we can get some guidance from our ancient authors. To begin with, we must recognize the fact that shepherds and goatherds, unlike swineherds (3), probably got no more than one litter from the same dam in one solar year. Vergil's eloquent phrase, bis granidas pecudes ( Georg , II, 150) seems to deny this ; Ovid (Fasti, V, 498) speaks of a lamb suckling on May 10, so it could be from a second litter (see the argument below) ; while Columella (II, 38) actually mentions a second brood, and speaks (II, 14) of early lambs which again could have come from a second litter. But these state- ments prove only, I think, that breeding methods had improved by Imperial times ; for Varro, our oldest authority on such matters, gives a schedule for sheep and goat raising which certainly rules out a sec- ond brood from the same dam in any one solar year : lambs, he says (R.R.y II, 2, 17) suckle for 4 months, and kids ( R.R. , 2, 3, 8) for 3 months; and we cannot add another 10 months for 2 gestation cy- cles in each case without transcending a 12-month period. We must therefore suppose that only one brood from a single dam was com- mon in any one solar year. This, of course, does not exclude the possibility that different dams were bred at different times ; and Varro makes it clear in other pas- sages, I believe, that breeders of sheep and goats could have used any of the 3 cycles which I have tried to establish. Goats, he says, are bred desistente autumno ( R.R. , II, 3, 8) and born tempore uerno (R.R., II, 3, 8) (4). According to Ovid (Fasti, II, 150) spring begins on Fe- bruary 9 ; we have no such exact definition for autumn, but Varro's (1) Consult Table I at the end of this article, and for the argument of this section follow the arabic numbers referring to Varro's cycles. (2) See my comments in A.J.Ph.t 84, p. 30. (3) A.J.Ph., 84, p. 29. (4) He also adds post quartum mensem : this must refer to the breeding cycle which could be a little short of 5 months ; unless, as I have indicated elsewhere (A. J. Ph., 84, p. 29), this phrase contains some reminiscence of the 4-month year.</page><page sequence="16">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 331 phrase desistente autumno might safely apply, I would think, to a pe- riod from the middle of October to the end of December, and that could include breeding cycles which began in June of the second 4- month year, in March of the third 4-month year, and in April of the third 4-month year. Goats bred at these times would be born in March, April, and May of the first 4-month year, corresponding to the same months of a solar year. According to Ovid (Fasti, V, 601) summer does not begin until May 13 - only a week before May 20 when the last cycle for goatbreeding would terminate. In any case, we cannot be quite so exact, for the calendar seems to have been out of joint with the solar year even after Caesar's reforms (see my re- marks on Ovid below). Varro's schedule for the breeding of sheep would also fit the 3 cycles which I have sought to establish, but, of course, at different times in the solar year. The best mating season for sheep, he says {R.R., II, 2, 13) is from the setting of Arcturus to the setting of Aquila, a period which Pliny ( N.H. , VIII, 187) identifies as that from May 13 to July 23 ; and sheep are born, says Varro (iž./č., II, 2, 14), at the end of autumn, exitu autumnali. His expressions would certainly fit the second and third cycles in Table I : sheep could be bred in June, corresponding to June of a solar year, and be born in March, corres- ponding to November of the same solar year ; they could also be bred in March, corresponding to July, and be born in April, corresponding to December of the same solar year. The first cycle in Table I, i.e. from the Parilia of April to the Agonium of May 20 in the next 4-month year is a little more difficult, since an April coinciding with April of a solar year is outside Varro's schedule for the best breeding period. I would discount this, however, since he is speaking of only the best period and he is writing at a time when breeding methods are some- what advanced over those of primitive times. Moreover, he tells us ( R.R. , II, 2, 18) that lambs were not castrated until they were at least 5 months old ; and Columella (II, 33) says that animals with fleece, pecus lanatum , were castrated between February 13 and April 13 in warm areas, between March 15 and May 15 in cool districts. Therefore, if Rome is a warm area, lambs castrated in February might have been born in September of the previous year, and Sep- tember might correspond with May of a 4-month year (1). (1) Columella's schedule for castration would allow the breeding of sheep on cycle 1 (Table I) in warm areas ; on cycles 2 and 3 (Table I) in cold areas.</page><page sequence="17">332 V. L. JOHNSON Apart from all this, I am fairly certain that the time correspondences must not be pressed too closely. Even after Caesar's reforms, Ovid (Fasti, IV, 163-4 ; cf. J. D. Frazer, Fasti , Loeb ed., p. 200) is 25 to 41 days off on the setting of Scorpio ; 15 days off (Fasti, IV, 677-678 ; cf. Frazer, op . cit., p. 272) on the evening setting of the Hyades ; and 14 to 38 days off (Fasti, V, 166 ; cf. J. D. Frazer, op. cit., p. 272 and 304) on the morning rising of the Hyades. In each case, he puts the phenomenon too early - generally in April instead of May - so it looks as if his calendar were ahead of time, or that he was copying an earlier calendar which had been so. He gets the morning rising of the Pleiades (Fasti, V, 599) about right, i. e. May 13 (Columella, XI, 2 puts this event on May 10) ; but Frazer (op. cit., p. 304) thinks that Ovid really meant the Hyades in this passage, and I would agree that this is more in accord with his system. This system is ex- tremely interesting, for it may reflect a time when economic or reli- gious events recorded for April really fell in May. Among other things, this would bring the Parilia of April into the compass of Var- ro's best breeding period for sheep (viz. May 13-July 23) (x). Conversely, Ovid's errors suggest that a whole cluster of events later recorded for the middle of May once occurred in a calendar April, and that the Parilia may have become so important because at one time it was part of this cluster. I have already noted the mor- ning rising of the Pleiades on May 10 (Columella, XI, 2) : and Varro (R.R., II, 11, 4) says that cheese- making begins with this event, uer - giliis uernis exortis (2). Varro is probably deriving uergiliae from uer (cf. W. D. Hooper and H. B. Ash, Cato and Varro R.R., Loeb, ed., p. 414, n. 1) on the ground that this rising of the Pleiades marks the beginning of spring. It is therefore noteworthy that Ovid (Fasti, V, 601) puts the beginning of summer, incipit aestas , just 3 days later, on May 13 ! The setting of Arcturus on May 13 (Pliny, N.H., VIII, 187) marks the beginning of Varro's best breeding period for sheep (R.R., II, 2, 13). This was also the day of Scorpion's apparent set- ting (Frazer, op. cit., p. 200) ; and finally we have the odd statment of Livy (III, 36) that magistrates once - apparently in 450 B.C. - took office on the Ides of May. It is clear that the middle of May by (1) In that particular era, of course, cycle 3 of Table I would be eliminated from the best breeding period for sheep. (2) The pressing of cheese (cf. Columella, VII, 8, 5) I have already associated with the origins of the Roman week ; uide supra.</page><page sequence="18">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 333 the ultimate calendar was an extremely important period for begin- nings of various kinds ; and if these beginnings, in some era of history or prehistory, belonged to a calendar April and encompassed the Parilia , Verrius Flaccus' description of the Parilia ( uide Fasti Praen. apud XIII, 2, n. 17, p. 107-145, esp. 130-131) as principium anni may have been justified in several ways. 9. Conclusions : Agonia and Indigetes To sum up, I would draw the following conclusions, however ten- tative, from the arguments which I have presented : 1 . In the 4-month calendar, there were 3 gestation cycles (x) for goats and for sheep : one from the Caprotine Nones (March 6) to the Septimontium or Agonium Indigeti or Indigetibus (April 12 of the following year) ; another from the Parilia-Consualia-Diualia-Lar entalia (April 22) to an Agonium (May 20 of the following year) : and a third from the Lupercalia (June 17) to the Liber alia- Agonium (March 16 of the following year). Any of these cycles, at different times in the solar year - and depending somewhat on correspondences between the calendar and the true seasons- might have been used for the breed- ing of sheep and goats, according to the rules given us by Varro, the oldest commentator on the subject. The second cycle probably became of paramount importance when - at some undefined pe- riod - the third week in April corresponded to the middle of a true May (2) . Agonium was at first the word for such a cycle, or for the be- ginning or end of such a cycle ; then only for the end of such a cycle. The indigetes were certain deities of an agonium. 2. The three cycles, and especially the first two, have strikingly common features ; and this seems to result from the imitation of an original gestation cycle for the breeding of pigs which ran from the Caprotine Nones to the next Caprotine Nones. Geographically, these three cycles are all closely associated with the Palatine hill and, I believe, with the low-lying areas between the Palatine and the Tiber : the flamen Quirinalis , it is true, appears to participate in the ceremonies of the Caprotine Nones and of the Parilia- Consualia-Diu- (1) Now see Table II. (2) However, I would not renounce the view, that, when the calendar began, one March of the calendar was also March of a solar year.</page><page sequence="19">334 V. L. JOHNSON alia, but Cousus, the god he serves, was worshipped at his underground altar in the Circus Maximus ; while the god Vediouis , who appears in the rites of the Caprotine Nones and in those of the Agonium of May 20, had a temple on the Tiber Island as well as on the Capitol, and I would imagine that the former, whatever the date of its formal dedication, is the original scene of his worship. 3. The flamen Palatualis seems to be a functionary both at the be- ginning and at the end of the first and second cycles ; the flamen Quirinalis only at the beginning of the first and second cycles, but per- haps also at the beginning of the third cycle : in this last case, he is remarkably absent from the evidence, but I would now suggest that Ovid has confused him with the flamen Dialis , in part because the fiammica Dialis eventually became associated with this day, and in part because both f lamines sacrificed sheep on other occasions - the flamen Quirinalis to Robigus on April 25 iuide Ovid Fasti , IV, 901) and the flamen Dialis to Jove on the Ides of every month. In the 4- month year, the fiammica Dialis is concerned only with the Caprotine Nones and with the Agonium of May 10 : this is a nundinal matter, but it could also be related to the beginning and end of gestation cycles for pigs ; and though her sacrifice was an aries, I would think that this had replaced an original boar sacrificed to Jupiter Maius (cf. Macrobius, Sat., I, 12, 17), a pig-deity, in my opinion (uide A. J. Ph., 84, p. 33, n. 7). The sacrificial animal both at the beginning and at the end of all three breeding cycles for goats or sheep, is a goat or sheep, except for the dog sacrificed along with a goat at the Lupercalia. The dog, I would suggest, is only a surrogate for the wolf which seems to lurk behind the conceptions of Rumina, Volúpia , and the Luperci. 4. As for deities, Pales appears to be involved at the beginning of the first and second cycles, and probably at the end of the first ; Vediouis appears by name only at the beginning of the first cycle and at the end of the second, but I would suggest that he is also the In - diges , or an Indiges , of the Septimontium , and the Faunus of the Luper- calia. I have given etymological reasons for identifying both Vediouis and Indiges as «yearling» gods. As for Faunus, there is very little reason to believe that a god of this name was actually worshipped in Rome : the Faunalia rustica , which I have mentioned above, is un- known to the calendars (cf. Warde Fowler, op. cit., p. 256 ; Degrassi, op. cit., p. 534) ; and if it existed as a Roman festival, it might have terminated - as I have shown above - a period which worship</page><page sequence="20">AGONIA, INDIGETES AND THE BREEDING OF SHEEP AND GOATS 335 of Vediouis at least began. Faunus is said (cf. Livy, XXXIII, 42 ; XXXIV, 53) to have been worshipped on the Tiber Island where Aesculapius and Vediouis also had shrines (uide, /./., XIII, 2, p. 110- 111 ; Livy, XXXI, 21 ; XXXIV, 53 corrected). Livy's statement about this looks suspiciously like a repetition, since he places the de- dication of temples to Faunus and Vediouis in the same place in the same year (194 B. C.). Finally, it is not a difficult transition from a god with a goat, Vediouis - perhaps himself a « yearling » buck in the beginning - to the goat-god Faunus or Pan of Greco-Roman myth. Consus appears at the beginning of the first and second cycles, but is strangely absent from the beginning of the third cycle, unless I am right in believing that Ovid has confused the flamen Dialis and the flamen Quirinalis who was, so far as we know, the priest of Consus . The sudden appearance of Liber at the beginning and end of the third cycle would lead me to believe that he is really Consus under a differ- ent name. Servius (loc. cit.) includes Liber at the Lupercalia because a goat was the usual sacrifice to him. But Liber per se had no temple in Rome ; Liber was often identified with Mars, especially as Marspiter (cf. Macrobius, Sat., I, 4, 15 ; I, 19, 3) ; and Mars, with his Equirria on February 27 and March 14, was the god who eventually supplanted Consus as the god of horse-racing. According to Tertullian (Spect., 5, 7) Mars and Consus were mentioned, together with the Lares, on an inscription over the altar of Consus in the Circus Maximus : this inscription is notoriously baffling ( uide Degrassi, op. cit., p. 499-500), but mention of the Lares - a twin motif again - along with Consus and Mars, plus Mommsen's plausible emendation of the word coillo to coitu or cubiclo , carries us back to the theme of generation which Warde Fowler (op. cit., p. 55), following Wissowa, was ready to as- cribe to Liber as an equivalent of the male genius. I am now inclined to think that Consus had something to do with all of these breeding cycles and that he was in the beginning, not a god of the storehouse, but a god of copulation ; if his name is connected with the verb con - dere , it may be in the sense that he was a storer or planter of semina , i. e. sperm, and no doubt a counterpart or by-form of Inuus, another god of copulation. It is possible that these major gods - Vediouis , Faunus , Consus , Liber , Inuus - plus some of the female deities listed in Table II, were indi - getes , i. e. « yearling» gods, of the « year» or breeding cycle, viz. the agonium. For etymological reasons - if I am right - Angerona and</page><page sequence="21">336 v. L. JOHNSON Acca, and the luno, i. e. iunix, of the amicula would also be appro- priate indigetes .
