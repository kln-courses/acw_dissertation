<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATTI SINTONEN HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY ABSTRACT. The paper sketches an account of explanatory practice in which explana tions are viewed as answers to explanation-requiring questions. To avoid difficulties in previous proposals, the paper uses the structuralist account of theory structure, arguing that theories are complex and evolving entities formed around a conceptual core and a set of intended applications. The argument is that this view does better justice to theories which involve a number of different kinds of theory-elements to give narrative explana tions. Theories are, among other things, devices which can be used to turn explanation requiring questions into a form which allows assessment of potential answers. Evolution ary theory, both in Darwin's and the modern synthetic forms, are used as examples. The view advanced is that modern evolutionary theory need not have a unique core to which other theories serve as 'subcontractors'. 1. INTRODUCTION It has been a standard complaint against philosophical metatheories that they are too abstract to be interesting or relevant to scientific practice. The new metatheories which focus on neglected aspects of inquiry have taken some of the bite out of the complaint, but much is still to be done. In this paper I shall sketch an explication of biological (especially evolutionary) explanation which makes use of some of these recent developments. The proposal combines two ideas, modified to meet each other. The first is that of a rich notion of a scientific theory, according to which theories are complex entities formed around a con ceptual core and a range of more or less well-defined intended appli cations. The second idea is about as old as reflection on inquiry and explanation itself, namely, that the search for explanations is to be modelled as a search for answers to explanation-requiring questions. As attractive as the latter idea is, it involves an extra difficulty when applied to explanation. There is a sense in which observations and experiments can be construed in question-answer terms: they are at tempts by an inquirer to force Nature to submit unambiguous answers ('Yes' or 'No') to queries concerning specific hypotheses. But questions which require explanatory answers are less transparent and their ties Synthese 89: 163-183, 1991. ? 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">164 MATTI SINTONEN to the world are indirect. They often (though not always) take the form of a w/ry-question (or a A?w-question), and questions such as these do not offer Nature a well-defined pool of options to consider. Since they are not in a form that Nature understands, the inquirer must, when approaching Nature, process them into a more transparent form (for further discussion, see Sintonen, 1990c). The formal covering law models of explanation, canonized in Hempel and Oppenheim (1948), fail in many ways in the task of giving purely formal criteria of scientific explanations. But since the entire intellectual setting from which the model arose was tuned to giving syntactic and semantic 'explications' within well-defined formal languages, there were tasks that these models did not even undertake. One of these is the rational reconstruction of the process of explanation-seeking. I have elsewhere argued that syntactic-cum-semantic models of explanation only work if they are able to mirror some pragmatic aspects of the process in which explanations are sought (Sintonen 1984a, 1989). Here I wish to illustrate that a more adequate view of an explanatory practice emerges hand in hand with the new understanding of theories that has emerged during the past twenty years. To continue the questions-to Nature metaphor, theories must be understood as entities which are rich enough to chop explanatory questions into shapes and sizes that are accessible to Nature. 2. DEDUCTIVE SKETCHES OR NARRATIVES? To see how ill at ease the received notion of theory structure and explanation is with evolutionary studies, consider first Darwin's pro posal in On the Origin of Species (Darwin 1964). In chapter IV, Darwin presented a deductive argument for the principle of natural selection, and many writers have held that the theory itself is - or is ideally - a deductively arranged set of sentences. The ideal of course is an axio matic theory, with the principles of variation, struggle for existence, and inheritance as its laws. These abstract core laws are then given an empirical interpretation through correspondence or bridge principles. Since the correspondence rules are included in the theory, they furnish a direct link to entities in the world. This is why it makes sense to say that Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection is true or false of the entities it describes (see Suppe 1977; Thompson 1989). The axiomatic idea has also been extended to the modern synthetic</page><page sequence="3">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 165 theory: thus, Michael Ruse has attempted to show that the laws of population genetics (or the two Mendelian laws that form its conceptual core) provide a deductive core for the evolutionary theory - or indeed for biology at large. Whatever the core - selection theory, population genetics, or something else - it is also part of the deductive idea that the core laws can be put to use to explain deductively a variety of generalizations and singular facts, from geographical distributions to those found in the paleontological record (Ruse 1979, p. 198; see also Ghiselin 1984, pp. 65-68). But although Darwin did give a deductive argument for the principle of natural selection, this argument clearly was not the main task in his book, nor in later work based on the Darwinian paradigm (see Sintonen 1990b). Evolution itself was at that time an uncontroversial fact and natural selection was widely recognized as one possible agent. The issue really was over its explanatory power and scope in the various applications singled out by Darwin (Kitcher 1985). This means that the real work was to be done on the level of the evolutionary subdisciplines where the selection theory could be given more content, not on the level of the core. Second, for reasons to be made clear shortly, the relationships between the core and the generalizations (or laws, to which Darwin referred in the Origin no less than 106 times) in the subdisciplines are not deductive ones. The statement view, as it has been called, also gives an excessively simple picture of the relationship between the fundamental theory and the phenomena. Although the core theory points to types of phenomena relevant to its task, it does not, as such, specify exact predictions in any direct way. One candidate for a potentially falsifying instance noted by Darwin was "any part of the structure of any one species" which had been formed "for the exclusive good of another species". He wrote that if such an instance could be proved, it would refute the theory of natural selection (Darwin 1964, p. 201). But this admission does not specify a precise observational prediction, and an unambiguous proof would of course be extremely difficult to have, as Darwins critics were eager to point out. And indeed the theory is open-ended or even fuzzy: it addresses various types of questions, and specifies some tools and strategies for answering them, but gives few detailed predictions and no proofs. Again, the theory contained large gaps. In his 'Autobiography', Dar win describes how he set out "on true Baconian principles" and soon</page><page sequence="4">166 MATTI SINTONEN realized that selection was the key to man's success in breeding (Darwin 1974). What he did not understand was how selection could apply in the state of nature. But even after Darwin had hit upon the answer to this question in September 1838, there were further outstanding ques tions, most notably the question about the mechanism of heredity. And though he came to entertain a theory to fill this gap, this theory was not along the right lines. This goes toward showing that Darwin's "theory by which to work" was more of an abstract heuristic device for further inquiry than an articulated structure. And although details steadily came in in subsequent years, the theory in its final form also contained gaps. Finally, if the covering law account of explanation is right (and if there are evolutionary explanations), then there must be suitable laws. Several authors have submitted that plausible candidate laws in Dar win's (or the modern) evolutionary theory are hard or impossible to come by, and that actual inquiry settles for model building around more modest and highly contextual generalizations (see, e.g., Beatty 1987; Mayr 1988; Lloyd 1989). This may well be true, but it is not the most salient drawback in the received view. Even if we could agree that the principle of natural selection (or, alternatively, the Mendelian laws), is a respectable law, the picture is flawed because the principle (or the laws) does not work the way the covering law model assumes. The standard rebuttal, of course, is that covering laws must be ap pended with initial conditions (and auxiliary statements) to give rise to precise predictions, and that actual explanations often are mere sketches cushioned by provisos. The rebuttal is along the right lines, but does not go far enough. The difficulty is that the provisos and the additional information needed to fill gaps in deductive explanations, or in attempts to ooze out empirical predictions, are heterogenous in nature, ranging from singular contextual facts to well-circumscribed generalizations (laws) borrowed from the other biological (and often non-biological) disciplines and fields. Thus, an inquirer who faces the task of giving an evolutionary explanation may have a strategy in mind for tackling his explananda, but needs several kinds of additional infor mation to get to the specifics: what evolutionary agent (selection, ran dom drift, etc.) actually is at work?; what application-specific subtheor ies and assumptions are needed?; and can these assumptions be given independent support? Deductive relationships undoubtedly have a place in the overall pic</page><page sequence="5">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 167 ture, but the enterprise of finding and substantiating explanations is, on the whole, too messy to fit the deductivist picture. Theories, in biology especially, are complex and often hierarchically arranged enti ties connected by various types of intertheoretic relations (see Tuomi 1981). And explanations typically require interplay of the selection theory (as pinned down to suit a type of application) with other theories, and it is simplistic to think that all these relations are deductive. Conse quently, explanations and predictions are not direct deductive conse quences of fundamental explanatory theory and annotated (singular) initial conditions, but derivations which traverse a series of steps from fundamental theories to phenomena. Covering law models certainly can accommodate hierarchies of a sort, for explanatory laws cited may be of various degrees of generality. But the bifurcation to nomic laws and singular initial conditions be comes problematic in the biological sciences. Not only are theories many-tiered, but especially evolutionary explanations incorporate a quasi-narrative perspective. Many of the auxiliary generalizations needed in explanations are historically contingent, and since they are not derivable from fundamental laws, they also lack lawlikeness and the authority that comes with this feature (see Beatty 1980, 1987). Furthermore, biological entities are not just more complex than physical systems but also historical and, hence, nearly unique in a sense that physical ones are not. This is because organisms keep record of historically acquired information and genotypes carry a genetic program which is a combination of thousands of different genes (see Mayr 1988). And how these genes are expressed depends, in turn, on historically accidental biological and extra-biological facts. This has been stressed by Richard Burian who notes that there is no workable generalized mechanics for gene expression to cover all contextual information rel evant for the determination of the effects of particular molecular me chanisms. This is why, writes Burian, "the analysis of gene expression is a brute force, messy problem rather than a neat theoretical enterprise" (Burian 1988, p. 262). The upshot seems to be that non-nomic general izations cannot be built into the fundamental theory however loosely characterized, and the prospects of dividing the explanans sentences of an evolutionary explanation into lawlike generalizations and singular facts seem dim. For these reasons an evolutionist keen on tracing the details of a narrative cannot resort to a batch of antecedently evident sources of information.</page><page sequence="6">168 MATTI SINTONEN These observations do not amount to a knock-down argument against the received deductive view of theory structure and explanation, and tidy structures can be erected if details are omitted. But the difficulties - the many-level structure of theories and the quasi-narrative perspec tive - suggest a new gambit for closing the gap between metatheory and practice. Rather than talk of actual theories and explanations as deductive sketches, we should recognize that there is something wrong with the deductive ideal. Evolutionary explanations are, in a sense to be specified, developed within the course of inquiry - and this fits neither the letter nor the spirit of the covering law model. To put this idea into question-theoretic parlance: when the inquirer puts an explanation-seeking question to Nature, he must be prepared to raise a series of small questions concerning auxiliary assumptions and initial conditions. 3. THE SEMANTIC VIEW To get a metatheory that is more faithful to actual scientific practice, John Beatty (1980, 1987), Elisabeth Lloyd (1983, 1986, 1987, 1989) and Paul Thompson (1983, 1987, 1989) in particular have applied the so called semantic view of theory structure to biology. This view has, in several variants, rapidly established itself as the main rival of the re ceived view of theories. The basic insight in the semantic view is that theories are not (parti ally) interpreted, deductively closed sets of sentences (with truth values) but, rather, are specified directly through their models. The classes of models are abstract extralinguistic entities or systems, characterized 'in mathematical English' (Thompson 1989). The laws (or generalizations) that enter into such systems are not true or false descriptions or explana tory claims of the nature and behavior of entities in the world; rather, empirical claims are obtained by claiming that an abstract system is isomorphic to a particular empirical system. Because this approach renders asunder a system and its applications, it steers around some of the difficulties in the traditional syntactic account. Thompson (1989) sums up some of the advantages as follows. First, when a theory is applied to empirical phenomena it often uses laws from other theories or fields to establish a link between its theoreti cal entities and the phenomena. The syntactic theory in which theories are (partially) interpreted calculi fails to come to terms with this fact:</page><page sequence="7">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 169 it does not tell us how such theory-external items are used to relate a theory to the world. Second, the syntactic idea gives a simplistic view of experimentation and theory testing. Theories, fundamental or not, typically are not in a form that allows direct testing. Rather, they require auxiliary infor mation and ceteris paribus conditions to relate to empirical phenomena. One way to codify a theory's access to empirical phenomena is through theories of experiment, data, and experimental designs. The hierarch ical idea of experimentation was originally proposed in Suppes (1962) and has been applied to biology by Elisabeth Lloyd (see especially Lloyd 1987). This has no counterpart in the syntactic view and, as we saw, the shortcoming is particularly pressing in biological studies. The third deficiency singled out by Thompson is that the syntactic conception does not easily allow joint application of several theories. The need arises frequently. In the syntactic conception all relevant component theories would have to be given a simultaneous axiomati zation within a single theory. But if two theories have disparate 'global meaning structures', a term in one theory may be meaningless or may be construed differently in another theory. The insistence to give an interpretation of a theory by help of theory-internal correspondence rules makes, according to Thompson, meaningful cooperation and in teraction impossible. The upshot is that the correspondence rules "fail to accurately capture the complexity and richness of the relationship between a theory and phenomena" (Thompson 1989, p. 289; Suppe 1977). In the semantic view, it becomes possible to see how laws from other theories can be used to relate a principal theory to phenomena. Indeed, Thompson claims that a theory/phenomena isomorphism can be justi fied even though, considered in isolation, the isomorphism seems not to obtain. Thus, although many populations are thought to be Mendelian systems, there are few actual populations which exactly fulfill Mendel's law. This is because there are crossovers, linkages and other processes which intervene. But cytological and molecular-genetical theories can give an account of these phenomena. Whereas syntactic accounts face the dilemma of either holding Mendel's theory to be falsified, or else of resorting to ad hoc hypotheses to deduce (descriptions) of phenom ena, the semantic view enables theories to be served by subcontractors, so to speak. I take the semantic view to be a big step toward a descriptively</page><page sequence="8">170 MATTI SINTONEN adequate metatheory, although the gains are often pragmatic rather than something that simply cannot be achieved within the traditional model-theoretic or 'metamathematical' approach.1 But the structure does not solve all metatheoretic issues (its proponents, of course, never claim that it does). In what follows I shall suggest that the structuralist variant of the semantic view promises to throw light on some aspects not yet treated adequately.2 Briefly, it allows us to distinguish between abstract fundamental theories and more concrete prediction- and expla nation-oriented specialized theories; it allows us to view the former as evolving entities which retain their basic cores while they are used to make special claims; and it more easily accommodates some pragmatic features explanation, prediction and theory-testing, and consequently removes some of the excessive Platonism in metatheory. This is because it can deal with a 'theory by which to work' which, despite gaps and fuzziness, serves as a tool for an explanatory and predictive practice. This is an important desideratum brought to discussion by Thomas Kuhn and other historicists in an informal setting (Kuhn 1970). Structuralist metatheory also departs from the orthodox statement view. A theory, or theory-element T is specified by giving a set of laws (generalizations) and by stipulating that an object (or a constellation of objects) is a model of T if and only if it satisfies the laws. One can then phrase claims to the effect that particular structures in fact are models of T. A theory-element T consists of a theory core K and a domain / of intended applications, where K in turn contains potential partial models (non-theoretically described objects or constellations of objects), potential models, models M, and constraints of the theory T? The potential models are entities which have enough structure so that it makes sense to ask whether they satisfy the laws specifying the models M of the theory. / (a subset of the set of partial potential models) delineates the range of intended applications of the theory and it typi cally splits into separate classes (so that / is a set of classes of appli cations). This makes it possible to distinguish between specific claims and the overall claim made by help of the core. The latter is the claim that all elements in the various classes of intended applications in fact are models of the theory T (or, more exactly, structures which can be enriched with theoretical functions so as to become models). What the theory (or a holder of the theory) claims, then, is that the entire set / belongs to the models of T.</page><page sequence="9">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 171 But, of course, as we already saw, lone theory-elements seldom (if ever) suffice in concrete explanatory and descriptive tasks. To deal with some of the complexities the structuralists have defined theory-nets, ordered pairs of the form (K9 /), connected by various types of interthe ory relations. A typical theory-net has a fundamental or basic theory element (K09I0) and a number of specialized theory-elements (Ki91?) E N9 introduced to make more specific claims about some more limited classes of applications (/? E 70)-4 The fundamental core of the theory-net may then give rise to several branches of more restricted and nested theory-elements, and the result often is a hierarchical tree structure. 4. NATURAL SELECTION THEORY AS A PARADIGM Before I illustrate how this proposal handles some of the anomalies of deductivism, a brief note is needed on how theory cores are applied to intended applications. Theory-nets are historical entities proposed by founding fathers in often somewhat sketchy terms, and developed by later generations. Theory-elements and theory-nets are thus relativized to scientific communities and time-intervals: a scientific community intends to apply its cores at a time (or during a period) to sets of structures. Such intentions to address explanatory and other questions are based on already obtained results, but they also reflect beliefs in and wishes for future net-expansions. One kind of development would be cumulative or progressive theory-evolution, historical development represented by a finite sequence of theory-nets N1, N29. . . , based on a unique theory core, such that each iV'+1 contains at least one theory element obtained by specialization from an element in the historically preceding theory-net Nl. One trouble with any such pragmatized theory-notion is that there are, at any given time, alternative (and incompatible) lines along which an extant theory-net could be expanded. Some restrictions are therefore needed to weed out (from among the logically possible ones) expansions that are inadmissible (and contrary to the spirit of the theory), and to pick out lines of expansion that are particularly 'promising'. Now apart from core laws, special laws and intended applications there are further items which serve as heuristic guides and constraints in the search for special laws and facts, viz., analogies, cognitive values, explanatory ideals, and other ontological and methodological commitments.</page><page sequence="10">172 MATTI SINTONEN Assume that such items enter as extra ingredients into the group commitments that underlie the normal-scientific activity of a group or larger scientific community. Such a constellation could with justification be called a Kuhn theory, represented by a quadruple (K09Ip9Np9N). Here K0 is the fundamental core, Ip its set of paradigmatic exemplars, and Np an associated pardigmatic theory-net. The function of JV^ is to show how the theory core K09 proposed by the founding fathers, has been applied thus far, and how and where it might or should be ex panded (Balzer and Sneed 1978; Stegm?ller 1976). Here N stands for the admissible net-expansions (at a given time). It may then happen that holders of a theory agree (at a certain time) on what applications are confirmed but disagree over the plausibility of the claims that certain expansions of the established net Nt will be confirmed in the future. Such disagreements indicate that the analogies, values, and other group commitments of a scientific community are not strong enough to dictate unique decisions - there are, then, schools and subschools within hold ers of a Kuhn theory.5 Exemplars explain one aspect about the fuzziness in actual theory formation. I shall take it, following the structuralists, that the range of intended applications / (a subset of the partial potential models) is not given extensionally but, rather, is delineated intensionally through some exemplary answers provided by the theory. Such a way of delineating intended applications means, among other things, that theories (or holders of a theory) have some degree of autonomy in deciding whether an object (or constellation of objects) falls into the domain of the theory. The claim of the theory-element at large is the claim that the entire range of its intended applications so characterized are structures which can be supplied with theoretical functions in a way which makes them models of T. The pragmatized notions of a Kuhn theory allows us to study the development of a theory in time. An inquirer's primary commitment lies in the basic core of a Kuhn theory which provides continuity over the claims made by help of more specific theory-cores. Furthermore, there is a constant tension between what holders of a theory claim and the results achieved at any given time. The holders of a Kuhn theory make the very strong claim that all intended applications generated through the exemplars are models of the theory, although, when it is proposed, only some such claims have been confirmed. This adds a further dynamic feature into metatheory, with no obvious</page><page sequence="11">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 173 counterpart in the received view. The driving force in theory formation is the internal tension between the claims and the accomplishments, i.e., between the claims of the theory to describe and explain a set of applications and the actual results obtained at any time.6 The received view focuses on finished products couched in a formal language, but theories are praised not just for their accumulated record but also for their ability to give rise to well-defined but open questions. Darwin was clearly aware that he had only presented the outlines of a theory-net, for he said that he was not able to prove many of the important claims, e.g., that any species has changed, or that the as sumed changes have been beneficial to the species, etc. Furthermore, he made a virtue out of a possible shortcoming, arguing that his theory also has value because it opens to the naturalists 'a magnificent field' of further inquiry (Darwin 1899, Vol. I, p. 485). And, indeed, an inquirer committed to a Kuhn theory characteristically faces endless specific questions within each class of applications: the paradigm cases serve to identify non-theoretically characterizable structures of which it makes sense to ask: Can they be turned into models of the selection theory? The theory both serves to identify the questions and to impose constraints on answers. Let me now illustrate how some of the anomalies in the deductivist account are resolved. The original Darwinian core laws consisted of the principles needed to deduce the Principle of Natural Selection. The most important paradigmatic exemplars which generated the various classes of intended applications are relatively easy to pick out: there were exemplary (though qualitative and sketchy, in modern terms) explanations of geographical distributions, morphological similarities, paleontological facts, etc., given in the Origin (and other writings). The basic laws and the classes of intended applications generated a theory net with an identifiable structure. Darwin made explicit reference to classes of phenomena, maintaining that his theory stood or fell in accordance with its capacity to classify phenomena. In a letter to Lyell, prior to reading Malthus, he described how the contours of the theory net emerged: I have lately been badly tempted to idle - that is, as far as geology is concerned - by the delightful number of new views which have been coming in thickly and steadily - on the classification and affinities and instincts of animals - bearing on the question of species. Notebook after notebook has been filled with facts which begin to group themselves clearly under "sublaws". (Darwin 1899, p. 268)</page><page sequence="12">174 MATTI SINTONEN Furthermore, Darwin subscribed to many more or less easily identifi able 'metaphysical paradigms' (Kuhn 1970, p. 184) and ontological commitments, such as the idea of harmonious design and the gradualist presumption. There was also the assumption that all evolutionary changes are adaptive in nature, an assumption which supplemented the claim that natural selection was a creative and not just a destructive force (Gould 1982). Finally, Darwin entertained a host of methodolog ical maxims, such as non-anthropomorphism and 'materialism', and the cognitive values of objectivity, Whewellian 'concilience', etc. Analogies were, of course, crucial in the process of conceiving the basic laws, but clearly they were in part responsible for the new way to see phenomena later. On the whole, we can take it that they, as well as the other general metaphysical and methodological com mitments, guided and restricted possible attempts to expand the theory net. And note that although the gradualist and adaptationist assump tions should not be included in the core (both could have been dropped without irreparable damage to the basic program), they came to mark the particularly Darwinian reading of the core. Both exerted consider able heuristic and constraining influence on Darwin's thinking and, although they are subject to considerable debate, they also played an increasingly prominent role in the subsequent career of the Darwinian paradigm and became unquestioned assumptions for many proponents of the synthetic theory (Gould 1982).7 Although I have suggested that Darwin's Origin gave rise to a para digm, it never claimed universal command over the evolutionary field, and its grip on even the most ardent admirers slipped from the start. The form in which the basic core was presented was qualitative and sketchy, and so were the exemplary answers in the latter half of the book. The abstract principles could be given diverse interpretations and scopes, and they could (and were) supplemented with differing and incompatible further assumptions. Holders of the basic theory could then subscribe to theory claims which were anywhere between the very strong one that all evolutionary phenomena could be treated as results of natural selection (a claim which, in all probability, no one ever actually advanced) and the weak one that some models can be found (which could not seriously be doubted). Consequently, it may be historically more accurate to think that the evolutionists who gave the selectionist core a place of pride were divided into schools (and</page><page sequence="13">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 175 subschools) with different proposals to expand the basic selectionist theory-element. Despite this it is not, I submit, too far-fetched to claim that Darwin's theory was a paradigm in evolutionary studies in that it structured the field anew: the various descriptive and explanatory questions from systematics to paleontology were now viewed with an eye on evolution ary patterns, and with selection as the number one explanatory candi date.8 The principles (or principle) of natural selection functioned as the most deeply entrenched symbolic generalizations of a disciplinary matrix. According to Kuhn, symbolic generations are the readily for malizable components of the disciplinary matrix, but he does allow for verbally expressible maxims such as "action equals reaction" (Kuhn 1970, pp. 182-83). The adage 'the fittest will survive' seems to me to fit this description; for anyone holding the selectionist core theory this must have had the force of a highly abstract (and, some would say, almost useless) principle which bordered on a definition. But although the basic core was highly abstract, it nevertheless guided inquiry by specifying what types of conditions are needed for selection (though not yet evolution) to take place. The enormous heuristic potential of the saying is tangible in the following quotation from Wallace's recollections (Wallace, note, discovered the principle independently of Darwin, and was not a Darwinian): Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask the question, Why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, that on the whole the best fitted live. From the effects of disease the most healthy escaped; from enemies, the strongest, the swiftest or the most cunning; from famine, the best hunters or those with the best digestion; and so on. (Wallace 1905, Vol. I, pp. 361-63) From this point it is but a short step to an empirically respectable study of whether the strongest and swiftest (through, perhaps, not, whether the most cunning) in fact escape from enemies. Here we have an example of a simple question-answer sequence which turns a near analytic principle into a contentful claim.</page><page sequence="14">176 MATTI SINTONEN 5. WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY (OR DOES IT HAVE ONE)? Let me finally turn to the structure of evolutionary theory. The main claim of Darwin's version was not the rather uncontroversial one that natural selection was a real phenomenon, but the complex and contro versial array of claims that it was the principal agent of evolutionary change. This amounts to the claim that evolution (descent with modifi cation) which the selection theory is said to explain, is in fact sufficient to explain the various distinct classes of facts. Here we have another reason for the loose grip of the paradigm, viz., the existential nature of the specific claims: the theory claims, for a given realm of intended applications, that there are suitable materials from which special laws and types of model can be constructed. And to make matters worse, even within a type of application there are, for any explanandum state or episode, countless narratives which count as Darwinian. It hardly requires saying that a theory with such a vague claim is too elusive to corner in a few moves. This gives occasion to several comments. First, the nature of the paradigm explains why there were few converts to the theory when it was first proposed, and why it was not irrational to resist conversion: the fate of the theory rested on a promise. But second, to the extent that it was eventually vindicated, it won through the accumulation of evidence when parts of the generous promise were redeemed, step by step, by adding new (still often sketchy) specialized model-types to the selection theory. Third - and this brings me back to the question answer idea introduced at the beginning - what the theory in fact did was prepare a new way to see the biological realm of facts and a new way to tackle existing questions. For the theory of evolution by means of natural selection imposed constraints on admissible answers and processed an impressive range of so far inaccessible questions into a form which could be addressed to Nature. We can now see that the best way to view evolutionary theory, in the Darwinian or the synthetic form, is not to view it as a deductively arranged set of sentences. The generalizations in the various subdisci plines are not theorems of a presumably axiomatized core theory (whether the qualitative selection theory or the population-genetic the ory), nor are they singular explanations entailments of the basic theory, even if initial conditions are very liberally construed; rather, the selec</page><page sequence="15">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 177 tionist core, when appended with specific types of generalizations (or laws), generates a hierarchy of subordinate theory-elements (in subdis ciplines) to deal with a multitude of applications (see Tuomi and Haukioja 1979). In terms of the question-answer idea, this amounts to a heuristic for raising contextual auxiliary questions by telling what kinds of parameters and variables are needed to design suitable models and, ultimately, what observations (or experiments) count as relevant (see Sintonen 1990c). But although Darwin envisioned an evolutionary edifice with the selection theory as the basic element, it was not clear then or now that there is a privileged core. The quasi-narrative perspective gives one reason to think that evolutionary studies do not form a coherent theory net, the way (many of) its constituent theories do. Evolutionary narra tives are not full-blown stories, in the sense that those of some philoso phers of history are, because there is no need to think that they are structured by the story-teller's anthropomorphic point of view. Al though I have stressed that theories are tools (artifacts) for the construc tion of such narratives, I nevertheless think that narrative structures are 'out there' to be discovered.9 But narratives do involve a chronological perspective which records facts that are accidental from the point of view of the theory. To rehearse some salient examples, Thompson describes how theo ries from cytology and molecular genetics are needed to square Mendel ian hereditary theory to actual facts, and how population genetics, selection theory and biogeographical theories pool resources to give evolutionary explanations. Similarly, in the interpretation of the term 'chromosome' which appears in the theory of chromosomal segregation during meiosis, the term is linked to certain physical characteristics and behavior, but when the connection is made, there is a need to employ laws from optics or subatomic physics to explain why that which is seen under a microscope actually has to do with chromosomes (Thompson 1989). Such interaction of theories is commonplace in actual biological in quiry. How could the quasi-narrative perspective be combined with a flexible way to deal with intertheory-relations? A recent generalization by the structuralists, the notion of a link, does this by allowing concep tual commerce between theory-nets. There are, especially in mature scientific fields, conceptual connections also between elements which do not issue from the same basic theory-core. An example from physical</page><page sequence="16">178 MATTI SINTONEN theories is the concept of a force which appears both in classical particle mechanics and Lorentz's electrodynamics. But where the two theories have joint domains the values of the force function must be identical.10 Where an intertheoretic link is asymmetric, it can with justification be called a presupposition link. Whether or not the two theory-elements have a common core or conceptual structure, it may turn out that the very identification of the set of non-theoretical structures picked out as intended applications of a theory-element T (say, thermodynamics) may require the use of another theory-element T' (fluid dynamics), but not vice versa. It appears that the notion of a link is precisely what is needed in the cooperation of theories with diverse meaning structures. This brings me to the priority issues concerning the various theories needed in evolutionary explanation. Michael Ruse has argued that population genetics is the heart of evolutionary theory because it is needed ('presupposed') by all other theories. Alexander Rosenberg, following Mary Williams, has argued the opposite: the theory of natural selection must be more fundamental than the laws of population ge netics simply because the former is needed to explain why Mendel's laws hold (to the extent they do hold) (Rosenberg 1985, Section 5.3; Williams 1970). But it is doubtful whether there is a unique evolutionary theory to talk of. The global structure of evolutionary studies lacks the neatness assigned to theories in the deductive ideal and is, therefore, likely to resist fruitful axiomatic presentation around a single core.11 Now, of course, from the point of view of the Darwinian program, population genetics merely fills a gap in the existing account - evolutionary studies envisioned in the Darwinian theory-net specify what size and shape a theory of heredity must take to function in the overall structure, al though it remains silent about the details. But, although it may have been Darwin's initial vision that all evolutionary questions are best viewed from a selectionist angle, it does not follow, even from that point of view, that the theories needed to supplement the fundamental theory could or should be incorporated as theory-elements in the selec tion theory. Perhaps the best way to see the situation is this: the synthetic theory of evolution, and the resultant focus on microevolution and its popula tion-genetic mechanisms to explain evolutionary changes, brought about a revolution in which the selectionist core came to have another, the population-theoretic core, as a complementary core. Here each net</page><page sequence="17">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 179 contains a host of specialized theories and model-types to deal with specific applications. Neither can be deduced from or reduced to the other; rather, we have two theory-nets with links between them.12 NOTES 1 The approach favored by the structuralists uses informal set-theory rather than formal languages. However, it is possible to assign the various components of the set-theoretic entities languages, and the same goes for structuralistic theory claims. Thus, the structur alist conception of theories can be 'translated' into the more conventional model-theoretic framework and the advantages are at most pragmatic or, in Stegmuller's (1979, p. 6) words, "practical-psychological". But I do think that these advantages are important for a perspicuous presentation of scientific practice - they are helpful in elucidating what normal scientific research is and how theories are used as tools for construing answers. For a lucid discussion of the pros and cons of the view, see Niiniluoto (1980). 2 I must emphasize that this is, at this stage, just a promise. The account given here is brief and informal, and geared to illustrating some pragmatic aspects of inquiry. A more specific disclaimer is needed, too. Applying the semantic theory - whether in the informal set-theoretic or the state-space guise - to Darwin involves an inescapable anachronism. Darwin's theory was a qualitative one and its application did not go via precise quantita tive models. Thus, when, e.g., Elisabeth Lloyd writes that, "the second half of the Origin can be understood as a collection of specific models constructed using the model types provided in the first half of the book, in combination with various specific assumptions" (Lloyd 1983, p. 121), the claim must be taken with some caution. The full force of the semantic apparatus can only be appreciated when the model types are quantitatively spelled out. The same goes for the structuralist proposal: talk of theoretical and non theoretical functions does not make literal sense until quantitative models are given. This becomes possible in the synthetic theory in which elaborate quantitative models have been designed. A more explicit discussion of the Darwinian theory along the structuralist lines, as it was expanded in the synthetic theory, would involve the identification of the basic concepts and laws, the special laws and, hence, the specification of the structures that enter into the core of the Darwinian theory-net and its elements. This, I think, can be done, for Darwin did present both actual and imagined models of the theory of natural selection. 3 A constraint, formally defined as a non-empty subset of the power-set of the set of potential models, may impose restrictions on function-values on top of those imposed by the laws of the theory. This may happen when a theory has overlapping intended appli cations: a constraint may express that some functions have identical values in the appli cations. From now on, however, I shall omit reference to constraints. 4 Perhaps the most important intertheory relation in biological studies is specialization, the adding of special laws to the basic laws. In specialization (in the naive sense, see Stegm?ller 1979, p. 91) the non-theoretically described partial potential models of the specialized and specializing theory are identical, but the models, constraints and set of intended applications of the specialized theory are subsets of the theory specialized.</page><page sequence="18">180 MATTI SINTONEN Apart from specialization, there are other more or less intimate relationships between theory-elements, ranging from loose cooperation to reduction. 5 This way of liberalizing Kuhn theories, and of dealing with subschools, is adopted from Ilkka Niiniluoto (1980, p. 31). For further discussion, see Sintonen (1984b, chapter VI). 6 Proponents of the semantic theory, New World style, stress that theories do not themselves delineate their ranges of applications. Yet, as Thompson says, "when con structing theories one has in mind potential applications and, hence, one quite naturally asserts these potential domains as the domain of applications to be tested" (1987, p. 27). The structuralist proposal in terms of a pair of structured core K and a set of intended applications makes this idea explicit by including the intended applications into the theory (through partial potential models). This is not just notationally covenient but has important pragmatic consequences. Indeed, it seems to me that the decision in the structuralist variant to so construe theory-elements makes them eminently suitable for the rational reconstruction of Kuhnian normal science. Note that Sneed's (1971) account was not initially designed for such a reconstruction but, rather, as a proposal to transform (Suppesian) axiomatizations of physical theories in 'real empirical theories'. For these matters, see Stegm?ller (1978, p. 3, fn. 2). 7 It is important not to equate Darwin's theory of evolution with the deductive core in which the principle of natural selection was established, nor with the core plus and its paradigmatic net of applications (and constraints). As observed above, the principle was uncontroversial and consistent with various non-Darwinian theories of evolution. In other words, one could accept the principle and yet refuse to accept the claim that it is sufficient to explain the various evolutionary facts. Similarly, although the 'protective assumptions' of gradual change and the adaptative nature of evolutionary changes served to define Darwin's theory, they should be kept separate from the abstract core. 8 Burian (1989) argues that the essentially historical and therefore contingent nature of evolutionary narratives is a major reason why evolutionary theory was (and is) not a paradigm in Kuhn's sense. The group commitments imposed by evolutionary theory are too weak to enable the resolutions of disputes between evolutionists of different per suasion. It is of course true that in Kuhn's conception a paradigm (in the sense of a disciplinary matrix) must provide a basis for unambiguous problem-solving activity. It is doubtful whether the view of paradigms as rigid holistic packages fits many of the mature physical sciences, and certainly not evolutionary theory. On the other hand, we should note, especially in his later writings, that Kuhn emphasizes that there are group and even individual differences in the way elements of a paradigm (in the sense of a disciplinary matrix) are applied. 9 Full-blown narratives are stories with a beginning, a middle, and an end, where structure is imposed by the story-teller's point of view. A story-teller is someone who, like a film maker, is able to delete and insert parts, and to mix material to suit her or his artistic or other intentions. Although Darwin did concoct stories, such as the wolf example (Darwin 1964, p. 90), it was intended as a plausible story of how things could go in nature. Thus, I do not wish to suggest that evolutionary stories are narratives in the historian's sense (of course, not all historians accept the narrative view in this sense, either. See, e.g., Carr (1986) for a discussion). 10 I owe this example and much of the following discussion to Moulines (1984). See also Balzer, Moulines and Sneed (1986). 11 Here I seem to side with Thompson (1989, p. 293) who writes that the primacy of population genetic theory is "only a practical decision based on the developed state of</page><page sequence="19">HOW EVOLUTIONARY THEORY FACES THE REALITY 181 the theory". He gives examples of actual explanations in which selection theory, popula tion genetics and biogeographical theory are all needed, and priority issues depend on a multitude of pragmatic factors. 12 Such a revolution, if it was one, no longer fits the structuralist account which assumes that the dislodged theory is reduced to the successor theory (see Stegm?ller 1979, p. 37).
