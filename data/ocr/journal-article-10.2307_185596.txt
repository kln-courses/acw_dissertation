<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION HANS FREISTADT 1. Summary. Following an initial section, in which the relation of materialism to positivism (including operationalism) and agnosticism is discussed, and the latter views criticized, a formal definition of dialectical materialism is given. Materialism is contrasted to idealism and dualism. Dialectics is contrasted to metaphysics. Some additional assumptions, usually included in dialectics, such as the interpenetrating character of the levels of science, and rationalism, are listed. In a section devoted to the relation between matter and spirit, the founda- tions of materialist ethics are laid by stating the humanist axiom of purpose. In the last section, historical materialism is defined, and some reasons for the occasional entanglement of scientific, philosophical, and political controversies are discussed. 2. Introduction. The purpose of the present article is to show that contrary to allegations occasionally made, dialectical materialism is a serious, consistent, and in my opinion correct, philosophy of science, and not a dogma, imposed by politicians, which no scholar worthy of the name can even discuss in its own terms. In the present paper, the emphasis is on systematic and formal exposition. In a subsequent paper, to be submitted to the same journal, an alternate inter- pretation of dialectical materialism, as well as some competing modern philos- ophies of science, will be criticized. The main purpose of such a criticism will be to emphasize further the position of dialectical materialism on some contro- versial questions, which cannot be treated fully in the present exposition without interrupting the continuity of the presentation. By a philosphical position (Weltbild) is meant an answer to the broad ques- tion: "What is the nature of the universe?" Before comparing various answers to that question, of which dialectical materialism is one, two immediate objec- tions must be overcome: (a) it must be shown that the question is a legitimate scientific query; that is denied by positivists, including operationalists; (b) it must be shown that scientific methodology can lead to an answer; that is denied by agnostics. 3. Positivism. Positivists (phenomenalists, sensationalists), as the term is com- monly understood (e.g. a composite of the views of Comte, Mach, and Duhem), deny that the task of science is to make any assertions about real relations in a real universe; they would limit the task of science to correlating sensory percep- tions according to the principle of economy of thought (explain a maximum number of phenomena with a minimum of assumptions). No claim is to be made that these assumptions reflect actual relationships among real things, existing independently of observation. While the positivist position is logically consistent, the following can be said against it: 97</page><page sequence="2">98 HANS FREISTADT (i) To positivists, sensations are the primary, undefined category; to talk of existence independent of observation is (according to positivists) "metaphysi- cal". To anti-positivists, either materialists or idealists (these terms to be de- fined below), existence is the primary, undefined concept, the meaning of which is generally understood; being observed is a consequence, sometimes possible, but by no means necessary, of existence. Positivists criticize the use of the unde- fined concept of existence; but positivists also use such a concept, to wit, sensory perceptions. The use of primary, undefined concepts is common in science: space and time in mechanics, energy in thermodynamics, state in quantum mechanics. That does not mean that such concepts necessarily remain nebulous; one can refine and sharpen their meaning, acquire a deeper and more precise under- standing of them through axiomatic properties assigned to them and through illustrative examples: for instance, existence has a slightly different meaning when applied to ideas then when appliedto tangible items; but a formal definition cannot be given, since there is nothing more fundamental in terms of which such a definition could be couched. Simplicity is a desirable attribute of primary concepts, possessed by existence, but not by sensory perceptions. If the latter are to exclude hallucinations and dreams, very complicated and partially subjective criteria of internal consistency must be imposed to decide which sensations are admissible (this means: to be correlated by "constructs" analogous to what anti-positivists call parts of the external universe-a definition in purely positivist terms would be much longer). Other sensations are inadmissible (to be correlated in terms of psychology, if at all). (ii) (a) No justification for the principle of economy of thought is given, except a purely subjective one. (b) No explanation is given as to the source of sensory perceptions. (c) The possibility of explaining, and even predicting, many phenomena in terms of a few hypotheses would appear to be purely accidental, and in fact very surprising; nor is there any reason why in general only one hypothesis, rather than several, should survive to become a theory. (iii) No reason is given wvhy science should be allowed to formulate hypotheses about individual fields of knowledge (botany, physics) but not about the overall nature of the universe. (Of course, it will have to be shown that assumptions about the nature of the universe lead to verifiable consequences.) (iv) By stressing the independent and unexplained existence of sensory per- ceptions, positivists have an implicit philosophical position, very similar to solipsism (see below). (v) Without a basic philosophical position, it is difficult to discuss ethics in a coherent manner. One may, of course, adopt a philosophical position for the purpose of discussing ethics, specifying that it has no relation to science. How- ever, that is contrary to the usual trend of science which is towards drawing connections between, rather than separating completely different fields of hu- man endeavor. (vi) Positivism is an unnatural philosophy, as is in fact admitted by many positivists themselves (e.g. Duhem); it is intellectually unsatisfying not to have</page><page sequence="3">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION 99 any views about the nature of the universe. Most scientists, as far as their day to day work is concerned, have in fact a definitely materialist outlook: they never seriously question the reality of the stuff they deal with. The object of posi- tivism-reducing to an absolute minimum the influence of preconceived and extra-scientific notions (e.g. absolute rest, absolute time) on scientific thought and speculation-is commendable; but among serious scientists such influences are usually very subtle, reflecting themselves in the type of hypotheses that are advanced; now positivism says absolutely nothing about the source of hypotheses -one hypothesis is as good to try as another. As a matter of fact, in terms of pre-Michelson-Morley physics, absolute rest, space, and time, were perfectly valid scientific assumptions, regardless of one's philosophical position. If a serious scientist cannot fit facts into his philosophical position, he will alter the latter. Until then, he will use his philosophical position (explicit or implicit) as a heuristic principle, to which positivists do not object. Then why not place the whole question of a philosophical position in the open, approach- able. like everything else, by the scientific method? The attempt to isolate science from basic trends and conflicts in philosophy is thus artificial and does not correspond to historical reality. (This is not to imply that a philosophical position is a substitute for science; this point will be elaborated below.) 4. Operationalism. Operationalism is an extreme version of positivism, less popular now than several decades ago, according to which science ought to be purged of all concepts (said to be "metaphysical"-a flagrant misue of the word) which cannot be ascertained at the present time by some experimental proce- dure. Assertions about the nature of the universe are said to fall into that cate- gory. Heisenberg is probably the leading exponent of this point of view, although the name "operationalism" is usually associated with Bridgman; however, more recent versions of Bridgman's position resemble classical pragmatism (e.g. William James) more than classical operationalism. Operationalism is closely related to empiricism, an older view which denies that the human mind can create concepts: it can only record and deduce (not very much at that-from the fact that the sun has been rising regularly every morning, one cannot deduce that it will rise again tomorrow). The development of the special theory of relativity is usually cited in support of operationalism. It is quite true that Einstein's early work is couched in opera- tionalist language-purging physics of "unmeasurables"-absolute rest, space, and time. At best, however, it may be claimed that such an operational analysis served as a useful heuristic principle: when abandoning an old model (the New- tonian universe) which had failed (the Michelson-Morley experiment), one is not likely to abandon those concepts which can be ascertained directly. It does not follow that other concepts may not be used in theoretical models, though when altering the model, those parts which cannot be ascertained directly are often the easiest points of attack. The appeal to Einstein's development of special relativity in support of operationalism is self defeating. In criticizing the Newtonian model, Einstein inevitably led to a new model of the universe, which found its full bloom in</page><page sequence="4">100 HANS FREISTADT Minkowski's four dimensional geometry, not directly ascertainable, but never- theless an extremely fertile theory. All modern presentations of the theory of relativity, including Einstein's, follow the geometrical model. Further, Einstein's early presentation contained at least one bold conjecture, not then deducible from operational procedures, to wit, the equivalence of mass and energy. Opera- tionalists do Einstein a great disservice by reducing his role to that of a cleaner of Augean stables, while the foundation of his well earned renown lies precisely in his role of creator of a new model. In terms of pre-Michelson-Morley physics, operational procedures can be de- vised for absolute rest. It would be naive to think that present day operationalists are not using operationally defined concepts which will evoke the smile of future generations of physicists. Underlying operationalism is a deep distrust of theory and theoretical models, and a surrender to the popular prejudice that science is concerned exclusively with measured facts. The division into ascertainable and "metaphysical" con- cepts is artificial. The table on which I write and electrons are both elements of successful theories to explain sensory perceptions (though, in the case of the table, the scientific reasoning involved is fairly trivial). There is no more reason to object to one than to the other. Fortunately, the more reasonable positivists only require that a hypothesis, to be admissible, must have verifiable consequences. Duhem, a positivist, was most eloquent in stressing the futility of attenmpts at building physical theories step by step from operational procedures. Why these same positivists refuse to apply a like criterion of admissibility to hypotheses concerning the nature of the universe is never made clear. 5. Agnosticism. Agnostics concede the validity of the search for a philosophical position, but deny that one can logically establish one such position to the ex- clusion of all others. This impossibility, which is cheerfully granted by supporters of many philosophical positions (including dialectical materialism), only illus- trates that deductive logic is much too barren to settle by itself fundamental scientific questions. Philosophy should be approached with the same spirit and methodology as scientific problems: gather data, advance hypotheses (this re- quires intellectual boldness and speculative thinking), deduce consequences from the hypotheses (this is all deductive logic can accomplish), compare with experiment, verify internal consistency, and start all over. The justification for this method lies in its overpowering success in supplying mankind with many of its needs, and scholars with intellectually satisfying explanations. It should therefore be adopted as a uniform methodology, and the only one known to-date through which reliable information can be attained. Why logical certainty should be demanded from a philosophical position, while it is not required of, say, the atomic theory of matter, is left unanswered by agnostics. 6. Matenralism and Idealism. The scope and methodology of philosophy being granted, one may proceed to gather data. In view of the universal scope of</page><page sequence="5">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION 101 philosophy, data from all fields of science must be examined. These data may be summarized as follows: (a) There exist sensory perceptions and thoughts in my mind, including what (so it appears) others tell me about their perceptions and thoughts. (b) A great deal of order is apparent in these perceptions, and more becomes apparent by a consistent application of the scientific method; many phenomena can be explained and predicted in terms of few hypotheses. Many phenomena which were once thought to be inexplicable, or were attributed to supernatural effects, have been explained. There is no indication that this pattern will change. (c) No all inclusive, rigid scheme of ultimate hypotheses has been formulated so far; each advance in science has given rise to new problems. Here again, there is no indication that this pattern will change. To explain these data (the verifiable consequences (a) (b) (c)), the following hypotheses (philosophical positions) have been formulated to-date (the classifi- cation is arbitrary; more or fewer formal divisions are possible): (1) The solipsist (subjective idealist) position: only my sensations and my mind exist, everything else is a dream. (2) The objective idealist position: The world exists objectively and inde- pendently of my sensations and cogitations, but as a set of ideas in the mind of God; the reality of the universe is reduced to that of its Creator (EIegel and some versions of Christianity). (3) The dualist-idealist position: the material universe exists, apart from ideas in the mind of God, but it was made by God; the spirit (God) is still sIlDreme (some versions of Christianity). (4) The pure dualist position: an intermediate position, according to which God and matter co-exist; God has limited supernatural powers. (5) The materialist (realist) position: nature (the material universe, which also includes energy fields, and perhaps other forms still to be discovered) exists, is all inclusive, and evolves according to natural laws which it is the task of science to discover. Perception, consciousness, thought, will, are attributes of matter at a certain level of organization (man thinks with the brain). There is no direct way of proving or disproving any of these positions. That is, in fact, the usual state of affairs in science when one is confronted by several conflicting hypotheses which explain the data. As shown by Duhem and Reichen- bach, reasonableness and probability (plausible reasoning), rather than formal logic, are the tools to be used at this stage. The following can be said for or against each philosophical position: (1) Solipsism is a tautology; it does not explain anything; in this extreme form, it is not taken too seriously by any philosophers, except possibly some sects of empiricists. (2) Objective idealism is the most reasonable of the various idealist positions, being an exact mirror image of the materialist position; sensory perceptions and ideas evolve according to God-made laws, but, if the dialectical hypothesis (see below) is made, the total set is inexhaustible. Objective idealism thus ex- plains all data. Three objections can be raised against it: (a) It is less natural and</page><page sequence="6">102 HANS FIREISTADT explains no more than materialism; if I see a table, and (for instance by pinching myself) establish to a fair degree of probability that I am not dreaming, it is clearly more natural to assume that there is in fact a table where I see one, than it is to assume that my seeing the table represents a complicated succession of ideas in the mind of God. (b) Objective idealism has less heuristic value than materialism; presumably God might have reserved some domains (say the time of disintegration of each individual uranium nucleus) to his discretion, so that there might not be any physical laws governing them; there is thus less of an impelling necessity for science to explain all things than according to materialism. (c) Since God is the universe, there is purpose to it, i.e. purpose is not simply a human concept; then it becomes difficult to explain injustice and evil except as a manifestation of God's mysterious ways. (3) and (4) Dualist positions can explain anything. They have, however, very little heuristic value. The chief value of postulating a God (apart from spiritual and emotional gratification) is to provide a short answer to those questions to which science has not yet given a long answer. With each advance in science, the realm left to the Divinity has been reduced. God has already lost monopoly over thunder, atomic structure, solar eclipses, the origin of species, etc., and he may soon lose it over the reproduction of life. Under the impact of scientific advances, liberal religions have "redefined" God, to the extent that He now is only an abstract source of ethical inspiration, and no longer the God Moses met face to face on Mount Sinai. Dualists are thus forced either to reject the findings of science (fundamentalism), or to de-personalize God to an ever increasing extent (he may become an abstract First Cause or Prime Mover). If the dialec- tical hypothesis (see below), according to which there is no First Cause, is made, God is left without any verifiable consequences at all, and the resulting dualist position (of some liberal religions) is practically indistinguishable from ma- terialism. Positivism has provided another way out, by admitting a clash be- tween (materialist) positive science and (divine) transcendent reality; according to a few positivists (Duhem), scientific methodology does not apply in the search for a philosophical position, but must yield there to revelation and emo- tional experience. (5) Materialism is clearly the most natural explanation of the data to be explained (it is often called "naive" by its opponents). If the universe has real existence, and is governed by natural laws, the source of sensations as well as their orderliness is explained. Economy of thought, and the possibility of simple and verifiable hypotheses follow readily, as reflections of real relationships. [Actually, the possibility of simple hypotheses follows from the assumption of a real universe only if there are simple relationships in that universe, i.e. qualita- tive features which we can identify, and between which we can recognize causal relations. In principle, one might conceive the existence of a real, perhaps even causal, but nevertheless absolutely incomprehensible and seemingly chaotic universe. For that reason, materialists usually make assumptions not only about the existence of the universe, but also about its structure. These points will be discussed in the next section.]</page><page sequence="7">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION 103 Of the various positions listed in this section, materialism has the greatest heuristic value. Nothing may escape the realm of scientific investigation. Every advance of science, which disturbs dualist philosophies, is welcomed by ma- terialists. However, materialism alone does not explain the inexhaustibility of knowledge; to achieve that, it must be supplemented by the dialectical hypothe- sis (next section). It has also often been alleged that materialism provides no basis for ethics; that will be shown (section on Matter and Spirit) to be based on a misconception. The objection that only a personalized, highly intelligent, spirit could have created as fine and as orderly a piece of machinery as the universe is purely anthropocentric; it ignores that the human concept of order is derived from, not prior to, orderliness in nature. Further, it leaves unexplained the origin of the creating spirit. If a spirit may have existed forever, why not the material universe? 7. Dialectics and Metaphysics. The modern revival of materialism paralleled the beginnings of modern science, reaching its first climax (in modern times) with the French Encyclopedists of the 18th century. Their materialism was of a mechanical nature, which is hardly surprising, as the science of mechanics had then known its greatest triumphs. Thus Diderot could advance the conjecture that in mechanics lay the solution to all problems. From a modern point of view, what may be criticized in the positionl of the Encyclopedists is not their materialism, which hailed the progress of science, and rejected the need of the supernatural as an explanation of phenomena or a source of ethics. Neither can one object to their arguments in terms of mechanics, which was, after all, the branch of science then best known. Modern criticism should be directed, rather, towards the metaphysical nature of their views. A set of views may be called metaphysical (in the traditional sense of the word) if it contains the assertion that certain categories (concepts), hypotheses, or classifications, are absolutely fundamental, immutable, never to be explained in terms of anything else, and contain the answer to all questions, or to all ques- tions in a certain field, without relation to any other field. Newtonian mechanics, as interpreted by the Encyclopedists, was a metaphysical view; so likewise is the present widely held view that the uncertainty principle and the concomitant acausal (Bohr-Heisenberg) interpretation of quantum theory constitute a barrier never to be crossed. The existence of metaphysically primary categories cannot be disproved, but assuming it, is contrary to experience in science. Whenever some physicists, for instance, thought they had grasped all fundamental concepts, new problems arose, which required, for their solution, qualitatively new con- cepts. It is thus not unreasonable to advance, as a further assumption concern- ing the nature of the universe, the anti-metaphysical, or dialectical hypothesis: there is no bottom to the categories required in science; there are no ultimate concepts which explain all things; there are no immutable building blocks. It may well be argued that dialectical materialism, as defined here, is a con- tradiction in terms, as matter and the laws governing its behavior are given the</page><page sequence="8">104 HANS FREISTADT status of an ultimate category. I believe this objection to be valid; a flexible interpretation of dialectical materialism must admit that dialectical materialism itself is not an ultimate model; the possibility of explaining matter in terms of some other concept, now unknown, should be admitted. (It does not follow that a return to the naive, anthropomorphic concept of a God in man's image is due for a comeback. Nor should one expect a mechanical, pendulum-like suc- cession of philosophical categories: spirit-matter-spirit, etc. Philosophy, like science, probably has no "bottom".) A similar objection (i.e., being a contra- diction in terms) can be made against dialectical idealist systems, for instance Hegel's. His absolute idea (the Divinity) is strikingly dissonant, a "bottom" in a system otherwise dedicated to the expurgation of bottoms. To reconcile the absence of absolute categories with the orderliness apparent in nature, the concept of levels is introduced by most modern dialectical ma- terialists. Levels, speaking somewhat loosely, are chunks of the universe (elec- trons, fields, gases, galaxies, animals, the human mind, societies) which are characterized by a unique combination of qualitatively distinct concepts in terms of which they may be described and understood. I do not know of any school of philosophy that has categorically rejected the concept of levels. How- ever, the metaphysical view is that only the "bottom" level has objective exist- ence; higher leyels are merely peculiar combinations of entities belonging to the bottom level. Thus, according to some of the Encyclopedists, only the ultimate constituents, the particles, are "real"; a table, for instance, is merely an array of such particles. On the other hand, according to the dialectical view, since there is no bottom level, all levels have an equal claim to recognition as objective features; just as the table is explained in terms of particles, the particles must be explained in terms of other concepts. The relations prevailing in this complicated structure of levels constitute the most controversial and least explored parts of dialectical materialism. The levels are n-ot thought of as absolute categories; rather, they are intimately connected by the fact that each entity simultaneously belongs to many levels. Thus a hu- man being has certain unique features belonging to the level "human conscious- ness"; other features belong to the level "animal"; others to the level "geo- metrical object"; others still to the level "collection of electrons"; and so forth. The concepts belonging to different levels are also connected. The impossibility of exhaustively describing an entity in terms of concepts belonging entirely to one level is often called the hypothesis of "inherent con- tradictions". The term "contradiction" is an unfortunate inheritance from Hegel. In most instances, a so-called dialectical "contradiction" is not a logical con- tradiction at all, but a dissonance, a maladjustment, entailing the necessity of a resolution, either in the nature of things or in our conception of them. The hypothesis of "inherent contradictions" is related, but not reducible, to Bohr's principle of complementarity; thus, the wave and particle aspects of "elementary particles" "contradict" each other (in Hegelian terminology: the wave aspect "negates" the particle aspect), but both are necessary. However (here dia- lectical materialism and Bohr's view on complementarity part company) such</page><page sequence="9">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION 105 "contradictory" aspects of a single entity do not simply co-exist indefinitely, each (whenever it is dominant) excluding the other. Such co-existence and reciprocal exclusion would make impossible the description of entities and phenomena in terms of single, precisely definable, models, and would contradict the hypothesis of rationalism (below). According to dialectical materialism, every "contradiction" is eventually resolved by the emergence of a new level, which blends the previously conflicting aspects into a single precise model (this process, in Hegelian terminology, constitutes the "synthesis"). At the present time, no synthesis for the particle and wave aspects of elementary particles is known, though many physicists expect that one will eventually be found. Other "con- tradictions", which had appeared in physical theories, have been resolved by the emergence of a new level of physics: for instance, the Rayleigh-Jeans and Wien spectral distribution laws, each partially correct, were reconciled by Planck's quantum hypothesis. Modern relativistic field theory has essentially resolved the "contradiction" between ponderable matter on the one hand, and concepts such as force and energy on the other. The harmony restored by a synthesis is not final, but only a temporary resting place, presently to be disturbed by new "contradictions". It is not suggested that a "contradiction" engendered by mutually conflicting concepts required in the description of a phenomenon is the only way in which a new level can arise. A different form of "contradiction" (in the Hegelian-Marxist sense of the word) is the transition fromX quantity into quality. There is nothing inherently contradictory (in the common sense of the word) in the description of a gas in terms of the mechanics of individual molecules. It is just not very enlightening, because the number of variables required is astronomical and unmanageable. (In Hegelian terminology: the quantity of molecules negates the usefulness of the concepts applicable to individual molecules.) Understanding is restored by introducing the level "gas", described by macroscopic parameters. (In Hegelian terms: the synthesis is effected, and harmony restored, by the emergence of the level "gas".) By their quantity, the molecules (as a set) have acquired new properties, like temperature, entropy, etc. The molecular and macroscopic levels are qualitatively differentiated, but definite connections exist between the concepts belonging to each. One description of this connection is provided by statistical mechanics, which discovers those concepts pertaining to the molecular level (e.g. the average square velocity) which have the properties of suitable thermodynamic concepts (temperature) pertaining to the macroscopic level. The principles of "inherent contradiction" and of transition of quantity into quality are not formal corollaries of the dialectical hypothesis. One could con- ceive, in principle, of an infinite array of absolute levels, and of large-scale quantitative changes without qualitative concomitant. These principles should be viewed, rather, as additional hypotheses of dialectical materialism, confirmed by available empirical evidence. The hypothesis of "inherent contradictions" refers not only to conceptual op- posites inherent in natural phenomena, but also to our mode of analysis, as it</page><page sequence="10">106 HANS FREISTADT developed historically. Thus, classical rationalism (i.e. the position of Descartes, not to be confused with the rationalism defined in the next section) and classical empiricism (Locke) are mutually exclusive aspects of man's search for under- standing of nature. The modern scientific method has provided a complete syn- thesis. From what was said earlier, one could speculate that the harmony pre- sented by the scientific method may be disturbed by subsequent methodological discoveries, a conjecture which cannot be dismissed. 8. Rationalism. Two additional hypotheses are usually made by dialectical ma- terialists, which, together, may be called the doctrine of rationalism. (1) The hypothesis of infinite causality: at each level, phenomena happen according to natural laws applicable at that level; nothing happens without natural cause; the like causes being reproduced, the like effect inexorably follows. The observation of different effects is conclusive proof that there was some dif- ference in the initial state of affairs. This hypothesis is very difficult to formulate exactly in verifiable form, inasmuch as all attending circumstances can never be exactly reproduced; but the existence of paramount and sufficient causes is as- sumed. The hypothesis of infinite causality contradicts the view that the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics offers the most complete physical descrip- tion possible; according to that interpretation, systems in exactly the same state may behave differently. The hypothesis of infinite causality eliminates free will as an absolute category, but not as a concept useful at the level of individual behavior. (2) The hypothesis of infinite knowability of natural laws: every single natural law (every causal connection) can in time become known by the systematic ap- plication of the scientific method. There are no eternal or intrinsic unknowables, only laws not known or understood at the present time. In view of the assumed infinite complexity of the structure of levels (the absence of metaphysical "bottoms"), it does not follow from this hypothesis that everything significant there is to know about the universe will become known at one time. Rather, the view taken by dialectical materialism is that each bit of scientific knowledge has both a permanent and a transitory aspect. The transitory aspect is due to the fact that knowledge must be couched in terms of concepts associated with a given level, no other (e.g. "absolute" or "universal") concepts being available; yet each level encompasses only a partial aspect of the entities belonging to it. On the other hand, the entities so described are real entities, and every bit of true scientific knowledge describes real relationships between them; this endows scientific knowledge with a permanent aspect. The classical example here is fur- nished by Newtonian mechanics, which was superseded by relativistic and quantum mechanics; new levels of physics were discovered for which Newtoniain mechanics was inadequate; but Newtonian mechanics is still valid at the level at which classical considerations apply. If by "truth" is meant conformity with reality, then Newtonian mechanics, as well as every genuine scientific theory, is partially true. The inability to accept the dialectical view that scientific truth is partial, but still truth, has led some (e.g. Philipp Frank) to forsake the concept</page><page sequence="11">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION 107 of truth altogether for the tenuous positivist position, under which science is reduced to a kind of game, unrelated to reality. The doctrine of rationalism is confirmed by our ability to consciously bring about desired effects to an ever increasing extent. It is this ability (and I believe only this) which distinguishes knowledge gathered by the scientific method from knowledge acquired by dreams and emotional experience. Materialists believe the former, but not the latter, to be a (partial) statement of objectively existing relations. These hypotheses (dialectics, rationalism) have ample support in the history and structure of modern science. They are not logically tied to materialism, can be advanced by objective idealists, and were already part of the position of Hegel, as I understand it. It is not unreasonable to assume that they reflect, at least as an approximation, a pattern of real relations among real things. One is justified in using them, as far as possible, for their heuristic value. Thus, when examining a scientific theory, it is proper to inquire whether it fits in the overall pattern, and if not, whether the fault lies with the theory or with the pattern. This demand of overall consistency is fully in line with scientific methodology. Needless to say, considering the tentative nature of these hypotheses, and their present inadequate formulation, one should proceed with caution and without dogmatism. 9. Matter and Spirit. It is often said that whatever the consistelncy of material- ism, it is unsuitable as a guide for human conduct, rejecting spiritual values and morality. Such objections stem only from ignorance; were it not for the fact that they are often heard from otherwise responsible persons, they need not be dis- cussed in a serious expositioii. What is involved is a double meaning of the word materialism; as used in this article and in philosophical works, materialism refers to the position outlined above, i.e. to the assumed primary and independent existence of the material universe. The vulgar meaning of the word is love of material pleasures and riches, to the exclusion of spiritual values. These two meanings are as different as if they were attached to different words. Most ma- terialists, from the Encyclopedists to Lenin, have stressed that the end of all human activity should be providing human beings with a full and rich life, rich in culture as well as in conveniences and comforts. It is quite true that, to the materialist, spirit does not have an existence inde- pendent of matter. Thus, according to the materialist view, man does not have a soul, in the traditional Christian sense of the word, as an entity independent of the body, and surviving after death (incidentally, many religious groups- most Jews, many Unitarians-likewise reject that view). It does not at all follow from that position that mnaterialists deny the value of spiritual concepts; an architect builds the foundations first, and adds the interior decoration later; it does not follow that he underestimates the importance of interior decoration; he is merely setting it in its right place. Spiritual values are the decoration of life; without them, the house is naked; but without foundations, there is no house. The universe, as seen by the materialist, is without intrinsic purpose. Purpose</page><page sequence="12">108 HANS FREISTADT is a human concept, axiomatically introduced by man. To the materialist, the introduction of such an axiom of purpose is a compelling necessity; since the uni- verse is real, other people exist as much as I do, and I must decide upon a code of conduct to govern my relations with them. It is perhaps surprising that among all serious modern materialist thinkers, and many non-materialists, there is agreement on a basic axiom of purpose, which may be called the humanist axiom: the purpose of all activity should be to provide all of mankind with a full and rich life, by satisfying their needs, material, cultural, and emotional. Historical materialism (see the last section) attributes the great support now enjoyed by the humanist axiom to the trend of history, which has now brought the fulfillment of such a goal within human reach. While the humanist axiom may seem self-evident to many persons, there have been periods when the purpose of all human activity was widely held to be the glorification of the sovereign, or that of God. It is often denied that the humanist axiom provides a sound basis for ethics; many feel that the threat of hell, or some other form of whip, is necessary to make us inherenitly evil creatures behave ("S'il n'y avait pas de religion, il faudrait l'inventer", said Voltaire). There is little in science to justify such a pessimistic view of human nature. The humanist axiom provides a consistent framework within which to reconcile enlightened self-interest with ethical behavior, in a society with plenty for all. Few who have known materialist-humanists would deny that they are, as a group, at least as ethical as any other group; if anything, their ethics have a more rational basis, being a self-imposed code of conduct felt necessary for the proper functioning of society, rather than a set of rules obeyed out of fear of the Lord. The humanist axiom being granted, ethics can become a science rather than a collection of taboos. 10. Historical Materialism. Dialectical materialism, an interpretation of which was given in the preceding sections, was first formulated by Marx as applied to the social sciences, history in particular. This application of dialectical material- ism to history is called historical materialism. Recorded history is viewed as a transition period from one classless society to another, from primitive (pre- historical) communism to advanced communism; by the latter is meant a ra- tionally planned society, without compulsion and without social or national con- flicts, with plenty for all. This transition unfortunately could only proceed through the intermediary stages of societies with acute class conflicts; the class structure of society raised productivity, while the class struggle served as the main historical motive force. With the industrial revolution and the development of capitalism, productivity has attained the level at which universal plenty is a possibility; the necessity for classes has thus disappeared. From this point of view, ideological controversy (e.g. between idealism and materialism) is regarded as a reflection, in the realm of ideas, of basic class con- flicts. This is not equivalent to stating that ideological controversy is not im- portant in its own right, or that ideological motivation may not be decisive in influencing human activities. It is merely a hypothesis to explain ideological trends; historical materialism is not economic determinism.</page><page sequence="13">DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM: A FRIENDLY INTERPRETATION 109 In particular, science is not just a collection of facts; it is a way of looking at these facts, by means of speculation, hypothesis, and theory. Human beings do the looking; human beings have a social outlook, conditioned by the entirety of their social living, which includes many extra-scientific factors. The connections between class relations in society, ideology, and scientific thought, are among the most complicated problems of philosophy, of which so far the surface has barely been skimmed. It is not surprising that political arguments should some- times become entangled with philosophical and scientific disputes. Politics and history have no bearing on the truth of a scientific or philosophical proposition, but may have a bearing on why or how that proposition came to be advanced, and what role it plays in the overall ideological and historical movement of its time. Historical materialism, as advanced by Marx, was generalized to natural science, primarily by Engels. That also has nothing to do with its truth or falsity, but is useful in explaining the reception it has received in various quarters. In- asmuch as historical materialism, either orthodox or somewhat revised, is a lead- ing ideological influence in most socialist movements, some of the most vitriolic opposition to dialectical materialism has come from defenders of the status quo. This is not a new situation; materialist rationalism (though non-dialectical) was also the dominant philosophy of the French Revolution; a good case can be made for asserting that, in general, it is the ideology of rising social and economic classes. If one accepts the view that there is an overall movement to history, and that this movement is for the better (historical materialism accepts that view, but it is not alone in this), then a rising class can justify itself rationally, whereas the old social order often appeals to irrationality, mysticism, and tradi- tion, for its defense. One may add to that factor the usual close association of established religion with the existing social order, urging submission of the op- pressed in this world, to reap their reward in the next. (In fairness, one must also appreciate the existence of a prophetic counter-tendency in religion, the ex- ponents of which, unfortunately few in number, have fought injustice as hard as any materialists.) Defenders of the existing social order have appealed to popular prejudice to make the words materialism and atheism synonymous with immorality, and to stigmatize their exponents. Conversely, most research along the lines of dialectical materialism has been done in the social sciences, by persons sometimes not too familiar with natural science. The application to natural science has sometimes (as in the Lysenko controversy) been marked by looseness of definition, rigidity of position, or polemics in a style not altogether befitting scientific discussion, in which the separation between what is assumed, what is to be proven, pure speculation, and personal invective is not always clearly drawn. The positivistically inclined scientist may argue: "By connecting science with a philosophical position, and, in the historical sense mentioned in this section, with political controversy, is there not a danger of prejudging scientific matters by a mind foreclosed by philosophical and political factors?" That is the reason- ing of the ostrich. The connections between the scientist's social and philosophical thinking, and the hypotheses he advances in his laboratory operate, whether he</page><page sequence="14">110 HANS FREISTADT is aware of them or not. The connections can be better controlled by studying and understanding them than by denying and ignoring them. Surely the thought processes leading to hypothesis-formation, the most crucial process of science, deserve careful study. If a correct philosophical and social outlook can help in formulating hypotheses which are fruitful because of their truth content, it would surely be to the scholar's advantage to adopt such an outlook. I can see no harm in such discussions, provided they are carried out in a spirit of give and take, without dogmatism (but also without undue pessimism about the possi- bility of finding a coherent Weltbild), with scrupulous adherence to the scientific method, and without narrowing the latitude allowed to the individual investi- gator. If anything, modern scientists are too isolated, and show too little concern for the major philosophical questions to which Boltzmann, Mach, Planck, Lorentz and so many others found time to contribute. 11.
