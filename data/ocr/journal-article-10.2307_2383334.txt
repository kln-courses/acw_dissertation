(MAN'S PRECONCEPTIONS OR HABITS1 You enquire about the meaning of konrin utsubotsu (chaotic surge).2 As Heaven-and-earth [read: nature] are the abode of man, they should come first in the investigation of scholars. Really, astronomy, geography, and celestial rotations, since western learning has been introduced, are steadily becoming more precise. But this is about all. As to the logic Cj&amp;ri)3 of Heaven-and-earth there is as yet none who thoroughly understand it. In this wide world, down the interminable ages until the present day, numberless men having given their thoughts to it, even though Heaven-and-earth, day and night, are not hidden, yet, why is it that nobody has considered them aright? This is because when man is born, before his intelligence has started to work, he has become so accustomed to what he sees, what he hears, and what he touches, that uncon- sciously a habit is formed. Habits become attachments which prevent our mind from having doubts and being inquisitive about things. Attachments are the enslavement of the mind that the Buddhists calljuki (habit).4 As long as those habits are not discarded, the mind cannot properly work. Although Ananda5 had enlightenment, he was not freed from his apish habit, having been a monkey in his formner existence. This is a good simile of what I am saying. As long as man thinks and judges things with a human mind, it is difficult for him to be freed from attachments. Even thinking men, past and present, have been plagued by this habit, and when everything in the world has been colored with man's color, it is quite difficult to have open eyes to see the true picture of things. Habits come about this way. Man walks with his feet and makes things with his hands. Walking and working are associated with feet and hands, thus forming a habit.

But without feet heaven rotates on and on day and night; and without hands the creativity of nature CzJka&gt; makes flowers bloom, children to be born, produces fish and birds. Should man have real concern about himself, there ought to arise some doubts about the heavenly rotations and the creativity of nature. Yet no one has any doubt, being accustomed to see these things every morning and every evening; they are overlooked with the ut- most disregard. (OBJECTIVITY AND ANTHROPOMORPHISM FROM the point of view of things,7 Heaven-and-earth are one thing, but water and fire are something else, and grass and trees, birds and animals, too, are different things. We too, like all human beings, are specific things. But man has acquired the habit according to which other things are seen from his own point of view which he is loath to give up. Hence the human habit of making everything man-like by seeing and thinking according to man's standard. Take, for instance, children's picture books which tell stories of a rat's marriage or of goblins. Rats are never shown as rats really are, but to the smallest detail they are turned into humans. The bridegroom has the double samurai dress with the big and small sword, while the bride is wearing the cotton cap and carried in a palanquin with footmen and young guards as an escort. Everything is made similar to man's betrothal. Again in the books of goblins, you will not see an umbrella turning into a tea-mortar, or a broom trans- formed into a bucket. But every goblin has eyes and nose, hands and feet, so that they must appear just like human beings. In the picture illustrating Nirvana, the dragon-king is attired with regular regal garb, wearing a crown as a human being: his real dragon nature is only hinted at by the fireman's hat he is painted with. It is such a mentality that moulds the ideas about Heaven-and-earth. In heaven, there is the Lord above Cjjtei);8 upon the solid earth, the god of wind and thunder. Although depicted in truly monstrous forms, they move on foot, and they do their work by hand. Wind is stored in a bag, and the roaring thunder is beaten out of a drum. If indeed there is such a bag, of what is it made? If truly there is such a drum, of what kind of skin is it made? If this kind of reasoning is carried further, heaven will not be able to rotate without feet, and the creativity of nature will be unable to work without hands. Let us take a more familiar example. All animals are either male or female, but plants have no sex. Without sex, it is in the nature of animals that they would not be able to pro- create, but without sex, plants by their nature do propagate. If one guesses from his own nature about things quite unlike him, how can be perceive the reason of things? Here is another comparison. Suppose that fire has mind and wonders how water can burn or dry 6 ;t 7 Mono $ things, read here: objects. 8 -l *+</page><page sequence="3">424 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 things, guessing from what fire has, but which are lacking in water; or the other way around, as if water given mind, would request from fire what water has. In this way, no useful knowledge will ever come forth, even after one has exhausted all his intelligence, and has spent his lifetime. The following story will make things more clear. Once upon a time there was an emperor, who heard of a beautiful wisteria in Sakai.9 He had the wisteria transplanted and he culti- vated it in his palace. One night, a pretty woman appeared in a dream lamenting over her fate of being transplanted into the palace. Waking up from his dream, the emperor took compassion on the wisteria which longed for her home place, and he had the wisteria brought back to Sakai. We hear many stories of this kind in the world. But plants neither have mind nor appear in dreams. It is characteristic only of the human heart to long for its native place or to reminisce about days gone by. Man's heart never gets used to the feeling of the changing seasons, and it rejoices over the making of poetry. But a wisteria has nothing of this, except when we lend to a flower, too, the feeling of man, and we make it a human. CDOUBT AS FIRST STEP TOWARD KNOWING NATURE FROM ancient times, even those considered wise men have been plagued by this disease, albeit in different degree. Man lives in his own world, and is unable to detach himself from it. It is like a pebble in the man's eyes which causes damage. In this way, unconsciously, man has acquired a habit which becomes an attachment, and, consequently, it does not occur to him to keep an inquisitive mind about things so that all his life he never wakes up, ending it as in the state of continuous intoxication. Still, you may wonder: is man always so uninquisitive? No indeed. When it thunders or when the earth quakes everybody shakes his head inquiring of another: what was that? To me, though, the wondering at thunder and earthquakes seems stronger than the thunder or earthquakes themselves. Man wonders only when the earthquakes, but when it does not, he does not seek for the reason of this. Man wonders why it thunders but when it does not, he does inquire no further. This seems very foolish. His thinking is formed by the knowledge common to everybody. From birth, before his intelligence has had a chance to develop, he becomes used to seeing, hearing, and touching. What he thinks his own knowledge is but a habit that has been formed. IfI take up a stone in my hand, then let it go, it will fall, Why is that true? Oh, everybody knows it. It is because the stone is heavy, so it has to fall. This is said, not because man has any knowledge of it, but only because he has formed a habit and unconsciously he thinks that it is obvious. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that man never wakes up and that he is, as it were, intoxicated. Hence one should wonder and be inquisitive not in extraor- dinary cases, but in everyday matters. This is what Confucius meant when he said that 9 Sakai 4* the chief city of Izumi province (now Osaka).</page><page sequence="4">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyo 425 there is no use enquiring about death, when man does not even know what life is like. 10 Man is worried at what will become of him after death, while the present is ignored and nobody knows anything of it. As the proverb goes: "Wade across the shallows just in front of you; leave till later the one over yonder." However, people worry about the shoal that lies thither, forgetting the one in front of them. This is what surprises me. Therefore, before wondering whether it is strange for a stone to speak, one has to wonder about his own power of forming words; before inquiring at the strangeness of a dead tree which is able to bloom, one has to wonder how a living tree can bloom, in the first place. If everything is put under scrutiny, not only the flow of time and the creativity of nature, but also what is our own and within ourselves, that is, the eyes through which we see, our hearing faculty, the movement of our hands and feet, as well as our mind and its thinking power; then we will understand that things are not so simple. People, if questioned, have the ready-made answer it "must" be so, and that is the end of it. They take for granted that eyes must see, ears must hear, heavy things must sink, and light things must float. All this is so obvious. But then, they must take for granted also that if it thunders it is be- cause it must thunder, if the earth quakes it is because it must quake, if a dead tree blooms it is because it must bloom, and if a stone speaks it is because it must do so. Those who have read books will say when teaching people that it thunders because there is a fight betweenyinyang.1l When questioned about yinyang, no answer is forthcoming. Hereupon I cannot see much difference between the learned man and the fool. Hence, if we want an intelligent knowledge ofHeaven-and-earth it is expedient to wonder about thunder and earthquakes to begin with, and to form a great body of doubt about all things, including Heaven-and-earth. It is said that when a wild beast is about to attack its prey, he always tries to conceal his appearance, and when a bird of prey is to assault, he always folds his wings. That is, before attempting something, one should stop to think carefully. Speaking of a bow, the arrow can fly afar leftwards only when the bowstring has been drawn far back rightwards. Those who have many doubts, are quick to under- stand. Those who have no doubts are slow to understand, similar to one who lets go the arrowwithoutdrawing the bow to the full. Peoplein theworldhavenoknowledgeofHeaven- and-earth, because unconsciously they have formed a habit, and they treasure it. Con- sequently, in order to obtain a profound outlook about Heaven-and-earth, as a first step you should begin by having doubts about what you have been used to in ordinary life, and put everything you come across under scrutiny. We have to think about and doubt every- thing, reflecting that we are human beings and as such we have human habits. 10 Confucius (K'ung Fu-tzu; Jap.: Koshi Il-I).

See pp. 40I, 4I0 for the special way that Baien wrote these two ideograms.</page><page sequence="5">426 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA,xx, 3-4 GBOOK LEARNING AND NATURE AS THE ONLY MASTER PEOPLE who keep records of celestial phenomena and their geographical features, and cal- culate the revolutions of the celestial bodies, are usually considered to have a thorough knowledge of Heaven-and-earth. Indeed, those who specialize in a field of learning, will acquire a precise knowledge of that but of nothing else, as I have previously mentioned. If one asks them why the sun revolves around heaven in a year, why heaven goes round the earth in a day, or why the latitude is taken once from south and once from north, the answer is only that it has to be so and not otherwise. This can hardly be called a deep view of things. Now let us take up the question of books. Books have been written not by the creator but by men of old, about things they themselves had studied. What those people well under- stood, has been clearly written down, but there are points on which they were totally ignorant. This is somewhat similar to the fact that man is superior to animals in his faculty of speaking, but in the sense of smell he has a handicap, being quite inferior to dogs and cats. From ancient times, those who write books have been considered superior to the ordinary mortal. As a start it is not at all a bad thing to depend on books for learning. Nevertheless, no books have been written by an author holding all the treasures of knowl- edge of Heaven-and-earth. They also have attachments, and if the right signs are not kept in view, those books will be the seed of a great habit. To affirm that books are the seed of a great habit, might sound to you as if I am carried away by emotion in my reasoning. But let us take an example such as happens before our eyes. Two children were born and while they had not yet lost the truth of their original nature (tenzen3, one was sent to a 7ido sect temple, and the other to a Nichiren12 temple, in order to make them bonzes. After ten years of study of Buddhism under different teachers, they returned home and met, and there followed a discussion about their respective standpoints. But the habits of ten years were irreconcilable, like ice and burning coal. Even at the risk of life, they both stuck to their own views. To seek the truth in them now concerning the original nature of their infant days, and to retrieve it, is hopeless. Hence a person thinks that what he has learned from books, is his own knowledge, and he has thoroughly understood it as if nature itself had spoken to him, and otherwise it cannot be. This is very likely the result of the habit which has taken hold of him and makes him speak like this. In the same way, ifwe call on a master, and he is well-informed, he can easily influence us. In order to consider the traces of the historical past or the geography of foreign countries; the changes and development of past and present times; how near or far are East and West, and hundreds of other things, even those which we have not seen or heard of yet, but have been discovered by men of this world; books indeed will be masters. However, Heaven- and-earth were not new in the past ages and did not become old in the present; they have been always unchanging and endless. The fire in our furnace is the same fire as that of 12 ; j</page><page sequence="6">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 427 thousands of years ago. Therefore, if one wants to learn about Heaven-and-earth, or about water and fire, first he should try to know this endlessness, having near by books for con- sultation, neglecting what is of no relevance, and making his own what fits. Hence, those who reached the stage of thoroughly knowing Heaven-and-earth are called Sages or Buddhas. However, originally they were but men, and consequently, our fellows in inquiring and discussing things. Our only teacher is Heaven-and-earth. And with this teacher, we may consider the words of the wise men of ancient times, of scholars and their followers, down to obscure and ordinary men, although they are not all the same in wisdom, as we see also in our own circle of students. Of course, a careful selection should be made. But Heaven-and-earth are so vast that there is nothing that cannot be contained in it. Therefore there should be no discrimination against any school of learning in order to have a comprehensive knowledge of Heaven-and-earth. A certain person once came to see me and told me that he held within himself a complete knowledge of Heaven-and-earth. My answer was: Heaven-and-earth being so vast, they could have contained billions of men all pretending to hold within themselves such complete knowledge, and we had a good laugh over it. After all, we may try to explain its vastness or its details, but this vastness and these details are well within the limits of Heaven-and-earth. For however much you esteem a superior and extraordinary man, he is, after all, a man standing upon this earth and walking within its limits. (DIALECTICAL LOGIC THE way of seeing things thoroughly is logic (jJriD, and the essence of logic is nothing else but the dialectic of antithesis and synthesis Chankan gjitsu9, setting aside all attachment of mind, and following the correct signs.13 To set aside all attachments of mind means freeing ourselves from habits. Following the correct signs means to know what are the real indica- tions and what are not signs in the least. For instance, the sun and the moon look as if they were traveling West, but in reality they travel East. Water seems to be the foe of fire, but fire exists beside water. The way of Heaven-and-earth is yin yang; yet in their essence they are mutually antithetical. Because of this antithesis, they come to constitute a synthesis. This is the way they make up Heaven-and-earth. Because of the unity resulting from their antithesis, we must view them in the synthesis that is born out of antithesis if we are to understand their true nature Chonzen). 14 Hence, logic is one including two, and the two lead to one. Being two, and standing antithetically, their dialectical relationship is manifested. Being one, their combination Ckonsei315 transcends the differences CkahjD.16 The dialectic of antithesis and synthesis and the mastering of the technique of seeing unity in opposed things; this is the only way to understand what yin yang really are. With no means to the meaning ofyin yang, even a 13 See above p. 405 for explanation. The ideograms are: ib 14 *4 15 ,a 16 Kaho WA means crack, fissure.</page><page sequence="7">428 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 man with the broadest knowledge, the widest intelligence, and the keenest perception, would still be incapable of penetrating the inner structure of Heaven-and-earth. That is why logic (jori) can be called the key that opens the gates of heaven. (THE MEANING OF RI THE ideogramjj originally meant "branches" of a tree, and the ideogram for ri means the texture Qsuji3 of the tree.17 As for trees, each of them has a trunk, a root, and foliage. The root divides itself into smaller roots and the foliage is made up of many twigs. If a person carefully inspects the place where these spread out into branches and twigs, the texture will be clear. What is the purpose of this texture? Its purpose is to convey the ki, that is, the energy18 which in turn manifests the physical form Ckatachi3;19 thus giving shape to the tree. If we now apply this to the case of water which is needed to irrigate rice fields, then, certainly, ditches have to be dug. These ditches are the routes Cri) of the water and where these branch out, thejj or main channels divide themselves into thousands of branch routes. However, as long as the ri or routes are maintained even though the rice fields are numberless; yet the water following its ri smoothly irrigates them all and the countless rice plants can be immersed up to the leaf-tips. Similarly, too, the weather travels East and West, the sun and the moon revolve along their course, rivers and streams flow, kites fly and fish leap: all because of the energy (ki9 of things following their respective ri or texture. You may try the same with leaves of any kind of plant wherever you notice big textures which further divide into tiny ones until becoming invisible to our eyes. The energy Cki) follows these textures and forms their contours. Therefore, it can be said that ri or patterns exist everywhere: in heaven and earth, in mountains and in water, in birds and beasts, in fish and turtles, in insects and worms, and even in fungi where the shape is formed by the energy Cki3 conveyed by its ri or pattern. From this you can see that the comprehension of the ideogram, ri as used in the com- pound word, jori has a meaning quite different from that expounded by the ancients. This difference is almost as great as between life and death. In the human body the blood vessels are nothing other than an exemplification of this ri. With ri or according to texture, things which have physical forms (katachi9 are beautiful or ugly, tall or short, always in conformity with their ri. Man, though, has become accustomed to this and so has lost the power of questioning things, thus making the body of man a complex of necessary drives. This also because Wang Shu-ho's20 words have come to be taken as containing a secret given them 17 Yjri 4$,fi is explained here in its original botanical sense: jo 4*- as "branch" and ri E as suji I 1: (AS), or texture, that is, the grain of the wood. Ri (the principle in Chu Hsi Confucianism) is here taken in a number of related senses com- ing to mean "routes" of water, but quite dis- tinct from Chu Hsi's meaning. See also p. 397. 18 Ki t see pp. 409-4I0 for discussion of this term. 19 Katachi X physical form or shape. 20 Wang Shu-ho 1I1fo (Jap.: Oshuwa) an author of several books on medicine of the Chin dynasty (280-420).</page><page sequence="8">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 429 as it were by the creator, and adhering to them like some golden rule. When there arose any doubt, people considered it petty wisdom and an obstacle to their Buddhahood, that is to say, salvation. Veins of the human body are the carriers ofenergy CkiD and of blood throughout the body. But this is not all; besides ki (energy) there is also shitsu21 or solid matter that must be distinguished from it. The ancients used the names of "veins" without giving further explanation. This, again, is because they became accustomed in this manner, and did not bother further, attached as they were to the habits of book learning, without trying to verify the correctness of indications. Taking for granted the word "vein" spoken by the first user as pertaining to the divinity, they considered him the creator. This arose from the abuse of taking a man as teacher instead of making Heaven-and-earth the teacher. Taking Heaven-and-earth for one's teacher is the device of perceiving dialectic antithesis. When this device is well mastered, prescinding from things which are not in Heaven-and- earth, everything else can be conjectured, even mysterious things situated in the remote depths of Heaven-and-earth. Logic Cjjri3 is both nature Qsei322 and bodily-form (tai)23 of a thing. The developing of nature into a bodily-form occurs through the yang yin in their antithesis. Hence each one has two in it, and the two realize themselves as one. Thus, one is two and two constitute the single great universe; yet one is the unifying aspect, nothing at all excepted. The uninitiated when looking up at the sky, wonder what is that deep-bluish, crystal thing called "heaven"; and while looking down at the conglomeration of heaped up soil and stone, they imagine it to be the earth. In some sense, this is proper; but it is a very crude way of considering Heaven-and-earth. It is good enough for calendar-making purposes and the Chinese type of astronomy which points out geographical features and celestial rotations. In other words it is good enough to enumerate things as they appear. CTHE TWO FUNDAMENTAL PHENOMENA OF NATURE HEAVEN-AND-EARTH are but the names given to the original ki, or energy, and to the con- crete thing Cmono9.24 Ki, or energy, forms heaven; while the concrete thing forms the earth. When there is one material-thing, we have one universe; and if there are many material- things, there are many universes. The ancients said that each material-thing had its own taikyoku25 or Great Limit. Buddhism speaks of the world of sands on the river Ganges, a world of infinite numbers. As each grain of sand along the Ganges is supposed to already contain the Ganges sand world, it is a hopeless task if one must comprehend Heaven-and- earth by piling up uncountable sand grains from the Ganges River. All this can be explained by just two phenomena. I say this because although Heaven- and-earth appear as holding an infinite number of things, in reality there are but two, 21 % 22 Sei li for Baien means attributes, or nature of a thing. See p. 4II. 23 , 24 Mono J*q see p. 409. 25 k * MN: xx, 3-4 M</page><page sequence="9">430 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 namely, the one with form Ckatachi3 and the other without. The one with form is called the concrete thing; the one without form is ki, or energy. As the one without form is not visible to our eyes and not touchable by our hands, the people of olden times, in their ignorance, thought of it as void and unsubstantial. Of course, heaven is in a sense void, at least in comparison with the earth's reality Cjitsu)26 which is also a bodily-form CtaiD. However, to think of heaven as nothing but simply a void, and unsubstantial, is a great mistake. If heaven were really unsubstantial and really void, then the sun and moon and stars would have nothing on which to hang; and we, too, along with other things, could not find a place to live. But since the sun, the moon and the stars are already in it, and other things as well as ourselves are moving freely in it; consequently this which is void of bodily- form must be something real. To say of a thing which exists that it is unsubstantial is to have very confused ideas. If the earth's reality CJitmu9 exists because it has a bodily-form; it is, then, only because of this real-bodily-form Cjittai)27 that mountains, fields, lakes and seas can be there together with it. Heaven, on the contrary, because it is void of bodily-form, can contain the sun, the moon, the clouds and rain. Hence, if one thinks carefully, it is obvious that ki, or energy, fills up everything: the earth with real-bodily-forms as well as the heaven which is void of bodily-form, but leaving no space that is not penetrated by it. (MAN'S SPIRIT COMING now to the human body, it can be said that the body is like the earth, having a real-bodily-form; while its ki, or energy, conveyed by its warmth and movement, is similar to heaven. Warmth and movement of the body have no form; nevertheless, they cannot be said to be nothing. The most refined and noble part Qseiei3 of this warmth and move- ment is the spirit (shin) of man, or in other words, the mind Ckokoro328 of man. Therefore, man's bodily-form is the vessel of the spirit while spirit, which has no bodily- form, is finally the life of the material-thing. Hence it follows that once the spirit has gathered, the concrete thing is constituted. And, vice versa, when the concrete-thing is organized, then the spirit is present there. Man is a small substance. Heaven-and-earth are one great substance. The small sub- stance is composed of spirit (shin) and concrete-thing. And so, too, the great substance is composed of spirit and concrete-things. Considering things in their opposing aspects, one by one, the concreteness of Heaven-and-earth forms Heaven-and-earth in their concrete aspects, and the concreteness of the universe is constituted by each individual concrete thing. Thus the spirit of Heaven-and-earth is only the spirit and Heaven-and-earth: while the spirit of all things is the spirit of each single thing. This is so because things are consi- 26 - 27 t 28 ji @&gt; '</page><page sequence="10">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 43I dered one by one, following the analytical way of reasoning; hence, all things of the uni- verse seem only to be opposing each other. However, for all the variety of forms we may allow, there are in reality not even two. All things in the universe are constituted by the same spirit and material-substance CdJitsu shimbutsu9.29 This is naturally viewing antitheti- cal things in their synthetic unity. The reason why we must see things dialectically, is that in each one of their forms Ckatachi) things are essentially ChonraiD30 antithetical. On account of this essential antithesis, the unity of synthesis is born. In the case of man-made things, two parts will unite perfectly only when, for instance, the tendon fits the hollowed part perfectly. The smallest bulge will impede a smooth fit. There must be, however, an antithesis in order to have a synthesis. The skillfulness in the works of nature appears in the fact that while they are antithetical, their dialectical relationship Cjjri3 is evident, but when they unite the synthesis does not show any seams. Thus spirit lives without physical form, while, a concrete-thing exists with form. Form usually lives by holding spirit within it, and spirit is usually perdurable in a form. Then, what is the condition of spirit? What can be said is this, that it is very animated and very active, or in common parlance, very sprightly Chichi hichi).31 CKONRIN UTSUBOTSU OR CHAOTIC SURGE THE method of logic is to be continuously analyzing Heaven-and-earth. As analysis pro- gresses and the antithetical features in various forms are investigated, we come to the differentiation of things in which each one has its spirit and material-thing. Although their appearance and activity differ in thousands of ways and aspects; yet their bodily form (taiD and activity Chichi tsukiD32 are proportionate: for instance, fire has the activity of fire and the bodily form of fire, while water has the form of water and water's proper activity. Fish and birds have bodily form and activity of fish and birds respectively. It is the same with Heaven-and-earth in regard to their bodily form and activity. This activity Chichi hichi) or liveliness is sometimes called utsubotsu, or surge. Konrin is the name for material things in their formation and features. People of the past called the features of heaven konrin, or chaos in opposition to the earth's features, which were designated hJhaku33 or rugged mixture. However, when I use konrin it means Heaven-and-earth together as constituting a bodily form in contrast to spirit which is indicated by the word utsubotsu. Konrin naturally applies also to everything which has been formed, down to the small shrimp with its strange shape and to the slow moving slug. Concerning konrin or the solidified central point in the earth's darkness, the only thing that can be said is that this pivotal point is so small there is no word to describe it. Nevertheless, this point does well support the earth even with heaven on it, too, and it does not bend. The reason why this pivotal center is so small as to defy 29 - 30 1 * 3 1 (A -zCA 32 O 7, 33 fof</page><page sequence="11">432 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 description is that there is no inside to it. Should there be even the slightest interior, it could not be called infinitesimal. This pivotal center having no inside, also has no outside; and even though surrounding it there may be great things, these do not form its exterior. What does not constitute the limits of anything may be called infinite. So we can say that this pivotal core of things is a center of them all and stretches out endlessly to form the konrin of the great concrete things. Thus this core has no limits in the formation of things, while its activity is kept alive by the spirit within. This is what I mean by saying that spirit is utsubotsu and the concrete thing is konrin. Moreover, all small material-things have been formed through their konrin just as their spirits wvere established through the utsubotsu so that they can take their place in Heaven- and-earth and fulfill their respective functions. C4CONCEALMENT AND EXPOSURE Cbotsuro3 OF THINGS WHAT I mentioned above and in various other places was said to be blue as a blue gem, heaven, and the rugged mixture of soil and stones, earth, could perhaps be better named, the coarseness of Heaven-and-earth. However, in ki, or energy, there is fineness and coarseness which variously conceal or manifest things. Considering, first of all, what fine- ness and coarseness (seiso) are, and what concealment and exposure (botsuro)34 mean, we should be able to judge about the blue up in the sky and about the stuff under our feet. In regard to fineness and coarseness, ki, or energy, is coarse although it may conceal its bodily-form Ctai). Still, it has its own place. Ki, which if fine, belongs to the interior of things; so it has no place of its own. Having a place of its own [or not], may be explained by the example of a water vessel. Suppose that in making a water vessel two holes are formed in it. What is their function? Well, suppose this water vessel can hold one shJ35 of water; there must, then, be in the con- tainer prior to the pouring of the water, enough room of one sho of water. This is not merely empty space even while there is no water in the container. It is already filled up with ki, or energy, though this latter has a concealed bodily-form. Therefore when water is poured into the vessel, the ki goes out the other hole; and when water goes out, ki comes in from the other side. It cannot be kept void even for one minute. Hence, where there is no earth, there heaven occupies the remaining space. As there exists such space, the sun and the moon shine there, mountains and rivers have their place therein, wind blows and rain showers down, and I with other things move about therein. Here, whatever exists with a physical form (katachi3 is called exposed-bodily-form Cro-tai), whereas that which has no bodily-form is said to be concealed-bodily-form (botsu-tai3.36 Although this bodily-form is concealed, yet because it has its own place, it constitutes the coarse-core of heaven. This heaven, if seen from within its fineness, looks like earth. 34 35 One sho It, I.92 quarts (U.S.) i.8 liters 36 t,</page><page sequence="12">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 433 Coming now to the spirit (shin) of utsubotsu (surge) we see that it does not occupy a place of its own. For this reason when water is formed, water through utsubotsu is active; and when fire is formed, fire through utsubotsu is likewise active. From the greatest things like Heaven-and-earth down to the smallest: in everything utsubotsu is always at work. This is what is meant also in the Doctrine of the Mean when it says that "it gives bodily- form to everything."37 Therefore, what is active as utsubotsu in forming konrin, and thus giving the bodily-form to things has no bodily-form of its own. What forms heaven in concealing, and what forms earth in exposing, are after all, Heaven- and-earth within earth itself; this, too, gives rise to the deep blue of the sky which is clearly distinct from heavenly bodies in endless infinity. And it causes the great compound which is earth itself, while the spirit (shin) of utsubotsu pervades heaven. Therefore should one see heaven as very great and earth as very small, it happens thus because one has no eyes to see Heaven-and-earth thoroughly. If one carefully observes Heaven-and-earth and its logic(j&amp;ri) and realizes that there are expanding and contracting functions, how can he say that earth is smaller than hleaven, or vice versa? This can be seen where there are spirit and concrete-thing in the process of formation; concrete-thing suitably furnishes an abode, housing the spirit or utsubotsu, and at the same time spirit is vividly activating the konrin of the concrete-thing. (THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF NATURE NOTWITHSTANDING the coarseness, by concealing, things are formed which have no bodily- form (tai); and by exposing, things which have real bodily-form are realized. Thus are brought forth Heaven-and-eartlh, the great material compound where fineness and coarse- ness are divided side by side and concealment and exposure are emerging one along side the other. What is concealed is the heavenly secret (tenki) and what is exposed is the na- tural-bodily-form (seitai).38 This seitai means that which forms things by exposure. It can be expressed by one: sei and by two: tai. It differs from seitai in the sense of yin yang, though the ideographs used are actually the same. The heavenly secret (tenki3 forms Heaven-and-earth by concealing, while the natural- bodily-form (seitai9 gives shape to Heaven-and-earth by exposing. Heaven (ten) is Heaven- and-earth insofar as it is the spatial and temporal world (uchii), and ki keeps in motion (tenjiD39 Heaven-and-earth. It is thus that Heaven-and-earth are formed, yet they are not shown as concrete-thing. It is with tai or bodily-form that we have spaciality and reality 37The quotation from the Doctrine of the Mean (chung-yung; t 4i; Jap.: chbyo) is in Legge's translation: "The Master said,: how abundant- ly do spiritual beings display the power that belong to them. We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them." Ch. XVI, I-2. Italics mine. The "spiritual beings" (kuei-shen *A'; Jap.: kishin) are the spirits of the dead, or ghosts in general. However, the "rationalization" of those terms had already been done by the Neo-Confucians in China in the twelfth century. See p. 407. 38 A,&gt; ffi 39A, +0t8+</page><page sequence="13">434 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 Ckyo jitsu9.40 Out of these come Heaven-and-earth, whereas sei gives water and fire to Heaven-and-earth. Thus, Heaven-and-earth is manifested with concrete-things. Whatever does not expose its bodily-form is like a receptacle within which dwell things that expose themselves. These four elemental things: ten ki sei tai are like the four legs of a go41 board, and if one is missing in the structure of the universe the other three cannot stand upright by them- selves. (THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE THE ideograms of the compound word uchui (universe) have been interpreted in the past as chui meaning the eternal duration of time, taken together with U42 as meaning heaven and earth with four directions. This interpretation is, generally speaking, correct, but it is by no means complete. Hence, it would be better to think of chui as that which goes through ceaselessly (kon kon); and u is better taken in the sense of being closed up in the bottomless darkness CO o).43 When cloth is woven, warp and woof have to be interlaced. To build a house or to make a box, length and breadth must be paired. These correspond to warp and woof. The reason why it takes warp together with woof to make things is that the world itself originally has been woven with warp and woof; consequently everything which is in it must take on the same pattern. Once a person came to see me and asked me to write some words on a circular bamboo fan. I wrote the following ideograms: A straight line, a circle, a warp, a woof. Man when making things, he has to tuck in the material along the primordial energy.44 Indeed, there is nothing without a crosswork of treads similar to warp and woof. To suggest an example quite near to us, our own body can be called the warp, whereas our life is the woof. Old interpretations of nature are said to be defective on account of lack of terms. However, the great substance never had a definite number as if it were composed of six elements. Besides, the meanings that words had in olden times are gone, not having been handed down to our day. So the best we can do is start with small things and consider them and after proceding some little way, we may try to know the warp and woof of great things. After grasping the great warp and woof, we should come to understand that Heaven- and-earth and all things are woven together by warp and woof. To know directly what this universe (uchu3 is, we should first perceive its warp and woof prescinding from bodily- forms of Heaven-and-earth and also from fire and water. 40 _k1At 41 Afi 42 T ",T 43 t A 44 The ideograms are: -A-[A1 AX4 - * '&gt;A EA .t</page><page sequence="14">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 43 5 (ETERNAL TIME AND LIMITLESS SPACE LET us now close our eyes, and think. We may try for a while to brush away Heaven-and- earth. Though we succeed in this, still we cannot do away with time, for that flows con- tinuously and passes away; neither can we do away with space that pervades the endless void and offers room to things. Kon kon means the continuous flow as of an endless stream of water which has no beginning nor end. 0 o means the bottomless darkness when there is no sun, moon or stars: when the earth upon which we walk cannot be discerned nor the heaven above us, nor East and West, South and North. Nor can we distinguish up from down. That is to say, the state in which no limits can be determined. To move on, means to pervade things in such a way that there is no place that is not filled up. To be everywhere by filling up the void: this is conveyed by the word, soku; but it must be taken in the sense of jisoku rather than according to the meaning that soku has in the compound word, chissoku.45 The latter means to be blocked as when a water pipe is stopped up with fallen leaves which prevent water from running through. 7fisoku means: to pervade into every corner, leaving no vacant spaces. What flows endlessly is time and warp. Moving things all go through it so that it Le- comes the route for all things. What fills up and envelops everything is space and woof. All existing things are in it; thus, it becomes the abode for all things. The sun and the moon, by effecting an indentation on time in its endless flow after the manner of warp, make days and nights, months and years. Heaven and earth take their respective places in the all-enveloping endless space, and with these, East and West, up and down, are deter- mined. Consequently, with warp and woof understood as the origin, can we know about the warp and woof of small things? Certainly they are not woven by man, but they follow the law of nature. Heaven-and-earth being originally a great living organism (katsubutsu3 including ki46 or initial power of motion,47 can move and rest. Energy (ki) flowing exteriorly makes Heaven-and-earth move smoothly. Concrete-thing from the interior keeps Heaven-and earth in a state of rest. What moves is like a circle and what is at rest is like a straight line. The motion within the circle tends towards opposite directions so that one motion goes eastward and the other westward. The opposition of motions along the straight line re- sults in one going upward and the other downward. Thus the inside of the bottomless darkness Co J) is a straight line and holds or halts, while the outside is a circle that rotates. What rotates forms heaven, and what halts makes up the earth; but rotation and holding on as operations of the universe are concealed in forming Heaven-and-earth. That is, they are all energy Cki9 and not concrete-things. Consequently, although Heaven-and-earth exist, they are not perceived in their operations 45 ; A 46 fi$ 47 See pp. 409-410.</page><page sequence="15">436 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 by our eyes, nor can they be touched by our hands. It is true that concealment goes along as the twin of exposure, and where there is concealment there is also exposure. However, Heaven-and-earth originally have no beginning nor end, and no limit can be set to them. (REJECTION OF BUDDHIST AND TAOIST THEORIES OF CREATION JUST as man cannot get rid of the habit of imagining a beginning and an end, so he cannot stop thinking of beginning and end in his speculation. That is why Buddhists say that there are the four ages48 of the world, and also teach that Heaven-and-earth are gradually formed out of emptiness and finally are destroyed and reduced to nil in a great darkness Ckggj).49 But the process goes on and Heaven-and-earth are again formed, only to return once more to emptiness. Shao K'ang-chieh50 and others have added to the theory of chaotic creation Ckonton kaibyaku)51 that heaven unfolds at the zodiac sign of the Rat, earth at the sign of the Bull, man at that of the Tiger. The closing of the cycle for heaven comes at the sign of the Cock, for the earth at the sign of the Boar.52 These theories are but poetical imagination. None of them knows anything about logic Cjjri); and they, therefore, mix up heaven and man.53 As a matter of fact, the heavenly secret (tenki) has no priority in relation to the nature of bodily-forms (seitai), nor do the natures of bodily-forms come after the heavenly secret. It is, for instance, like a roll of brocade which is woven on the top side and on the reverse side at the same time. Or, like a chick which hatches out with left and right wings at the same time. Therefore, if the concealment of Heaven-and-earth is explained first, it does not mean that concealment comes first. Nor, just because the exposure of Heaven-and-earth is explained later, does this indicate that exposure comes afterward. Thus, when there is a concrete-thing, it must have energy (ki) that conceals, and bodily- form that exposes. When the bodily-form divides, spatiality and reality (kyo-jitsu) come into existence. The form Ctai) of spatiality well constitutes heaven, while the form of reality forms the earth. Then its negative nature Cinsei) being from the limitless and holding together the inside of things, organizes the earth. And when negative nature is blown off by the positive energy Cyki),54 water is formed. When the positive nature OyJsei) starts from a central point and scatters into heaven where it is collected by negative-energy Cinki),55 then fire is formed. In this way, the sun, moon, and stars are there above; mountains, fields, 48 The four ages (kalpa: Jap. ko -At) of the Buddhist world-view indicated by Baien are: Jo A. the formative; ju 41 the existing; e i1 the destructive; kg t the empty. 49 50 Shao Young 04 or Shao K'ang-chien O ,P (jap.: Shokosetsu) 51 ,j 52 Baien, of the twelve signs of the zodiac, (juni-shi t) writes about the following: ne T- rat; ushi * bull; tora i tiger; tori - cock; inu AX dog; i tC boar. 53 Mixing up heaven and man means, for Baien, confusing objective reality with subjec- tive knowledge. See p. 423. 54 55</page><page sequence="16">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 437 lakes and seas are here below. According to a childish idea, what is called earth is supposed to have sprung up from konrinzai or the bowels of the earth; and what is called heaven is supposed to be the crystal pure mirror (jihari)56 which is spread out like a ceiling; while betwixt the two there is said to be nothing but an empty void. Accordingly, the seas of East and West, North and South are imagined as ever stretching further and further limitlessly, and the moon and sun come out after passing up from the underground areas of the earth. They do not know that the true shape of Heaven-and-earth is a round globe and that the earth constitutes its core. ( SPHEROIDICITY OF HEAVEN-AND-EARTH THUS, the true condition of Heaven-and-earth is that the earth is round and its protuber- ances become land masses and its sunken parts become seas; and men populate the high and low places in four directions. The whole, seas included, is round, and though the heaven is limitless, still it is round and the heavenly form is maintained. However, men stick to old habits and think of heaven as above and of earth as under their feet. Therefore following the evidence such as that of water flowing when a dish is tilted, men do not try to use their brains. Thus, they stick to habits supposing that in things there necessarily are beginning and end; that earth is flat and heaven extended; that the moon and the sun move on Westward; that water overflows when it is in an inclined vessel and evaporates when it is placed over fire; or that fire is extinguished when water is poured on it. All this is firmly held as well substantiated. And consequently, they do not think at all about putting their brains to work. It is of no avail to talk with them. It would be like throwing water upon stones. Therefore, if one wants to know Heaven-and-earth he should first try to learn the coarse aspect Qsotei)57 of celestial bodies, then the revolutions of the sun and of the moon. There are the makers of calendars (suihoka355 who study the revolutions and the books of celestial geography about the heavenly bodies. Since occidental science has been introduced, those studies have led to actual experiments and surveys by which they are becoming gradually more and more precise. They will advance further in future. Since there are such men in the world, under them one can study without too much difficulty. Then, gradually forming our own point of view, we can avoid being misled by the erroneous opinions of past genera- tions. At any rate, one should first consider that Heaven-and-earth are round. When this is understood, one will not be surprised to see water that does not necessarily overflow even when inclined, or when West is pointed to as if it were East. As regards day and night be- coming longer and shorter in turn, or Spring and Autumn arriving at the same time, one will find in these an opportunity for practical applications of the scheme of [dialectical] 56 4* Ik ;i4v 57 I 58 4fjI</page><page sequence="17">438 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 antithesis and synthesis (bankan gjitsu). Thus he will see for the first time, how he has hitherto adhered to habits, and as a consequence, his intelligence will start to function a little. This will be a step toward a thorough going view of things. Therefore, as the first step in knowing Heaven-and-earth thoroughly, there is nothing more important than to know the celestial bodies and the revolutions of the sun and the moon. As regards books of ancient and modern times, even though there is a great abundance of them, they have all been written by those under the influence of habits. Since this is the case, books offer no remedy towards freeing us from our attachment to habits. In saying this, I may have made my doctrine sound to you as if I think that only what I say were good, but his is not necessarily so. 4EBAIEN'S CONTRIBUTION: HIS ATTITUDE AS A TEACHER IN Heaven-and-earth there is the dialectical relationship Cjjri) which becomes more dis- tinct in the process of separation, while, in the synthesis, all the differences disappear. This is the true structure of Heaven-and-earth. And this, I affirm, has not been explained by the men of the past. Saying that every one of those ancients did not know the mysterious synthesis (mitsugo)59 of Heaven-and-earth, I do not pretend to know everything about Heaven-and-earth. I, too, without a doubt have a great tendency to rely on habits. There- fore, my three books60 with their hundreds and thousands of words should be attributed to Heaven-and-earth if, by any chance, there were parts of them that corresponded to Heaven-and-earth. And then, the parts that were not corresponding would have to be ascribed to Susumu.61 Therefore, it is not necessary to be over-trusting in my theories; rather, one should verify them on the basis of his own experience of Heaven-and-earth. Indeed, those who study under a teacher, feel ashamed to disagree with their teacher's opinions; and the teachers, for their part, do not like to have pupils disagreeing with them. The reason for this is the mistake of taking a man as one's teacher. Susumu, however, takes Heaven-and- earth as the teacher, and I consider even these youngsters (whom I have taught to read) to be fellow students and friends. Thus I cannot entertain ill feeling against them for their divergent views, and I am always telling them this, so that they should be clear on this point CLEARNING FROM BOOKS AND LEARNING FROM FACTS THEN, too, it must be said that there is both learning from books and also learning from facts. Learning from books means to discuss the sayings of Confucius recorded in the Analects.62 Confucius said, for example, that it is all right to think only twice before acting rather than three times as Chi Wang was wont to do. If all the pros and cons of this dis- cussion are to be thoroughly aired, the multitude of ideas will inevitably provoke such 59 T-f 60 Allusions to Gengo * Zeigo *-; and Kango R-4i; 61 "Susumu" - is the personal name ofMiura. 62 Chi Wang-Tsu 4-X)ZJi (Jap.: Kobunshi), see Analects B.V., Ch. xix.</page><page sequence="18">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 439 hesitation and doubt as to preclude any practical decision. Yet, there are such situations as demand immediate decision, while other affairs there are also which may be put off, to be reconsidered hundreds or even thousands of times. Saying that before agreeing, one must consider it twice: we mean that this should be properly understood as thinking the matter over two times. Two considerations before acting may seem enough; however, further pondering over each problem is advisable so that, if possible, nothing is left that will be a cause for regret later. We may dispense with the explanation of commentators on right and wrong. The need for such explanation arises from the feeble learning of the pupils who have to stand by the opinion of their teacher with the result that enemy factions arise among pupils. If you take my words literally, you might suppose that it makes no difference what meaning sentences have. This comes about, though, because you have an attachment to my words. Obviously, those who have parents (be they followers of the Sorai school or of the Chu Hsi school) must learn to have filial piety toward them. For those who practice hurling the spear-no matter whether it be straight-headed or knobbed-they must learn to make it fly accurately. I do not mean that discussion on the good points of one thing or another is only useless talk. Still, there is usually much biased thinking in it all. It is just like the old disputation between drinkers and non-drinkers as to whether sake is more tasty than bean-jam buns Cmanji).63 To such contentious discussions there has never been a reason- able conclusion. Right and wrong in Heaven-and-earth ought to be something equally understood by scholars and ordinary people, loved and hated respectively by both ruler and subject, and praised alike by Buddhists and Confucianists. But to have everybody think about right and wrong just like one's self and agree about the merits and demerits of his fellow-men, is about the same as wanting to have the faces of all the men in the world alike. Certainly not even the hands of the Creator of things could succeed in this, so it is folly to think that it can be done by us. In saying this, somebody could object further that even the evil that is hated by everybody cannot be corrected. But again this is merely to cling to words, as mentioned before. 4CEFFECTUAL STUDY AND OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER, Heaven-and-earth are a living organism and therefore, the means to know it must be effectual; otherwise, for all their goodness, they are of no use. Heaven-and-earth are not concealed from men, but are plainly in view. Therefore, there is not much need to be reading books or asking others about things. Nevertheless, without books to read and men to discuss with, knowledge cannot be developed. Even the foolish and dull words of people can be taken up as stepping-stones for you to learn a comprehensive view point, if only these are tested against the truth of Heaven-and-earth. 63 i,A</page><page sequence="19">MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 Different scholars are apt to say: my method is like this; his is like that. Heaven-and- earth, however, are not made up by themselves, so that we have to follow what is already there. Either to have a comprehensive view of Heaven-and-earth, or to see human affairs in their details, the only work which must be done by us is to see what is there just as it is. This is so true that although we come to understand things, still fire burns as much after as before we learned about it. It is true that names are given to things by men. Thus the reed is called ashi in Naniwa, in Ise hamaogi.64 In spite of that, we cannot alter reality arbitrarily. In this way, knowing the heavenly secret (tenki), and nature of bodily-forms Cseitai), we can have a comprehensive view of Heaven-and-earth. Thus the warp in the endlessly passing process in filling up the woof (keitsu isoku) there is the nonmoving reality of soil (kyod&amp;jitsuchi)65 in Heaven-and-earth. Overhead the sun and the moon rotate, while water and soil perdure underfoot, and I myself together with all the other things go on according to our several ways and dwell in respectively different dwellings. Indeed, our eyes are dazzled by things, and all the visible things seem to be scattered in disorder and confusion. But when we come to put our finger on Heaven-and-earth, and we try to as- certain the position of Heaven-and-earth, then we see that fire shines above and water fills in below. For Heaven-and-earth are a great organism, and their creative energy (in- un) keeps pressing and moving (ma-tj)66 to bring out sensitive, warm-blooded, moving animals together with insensible, cold-blooded, nonmoving plants. From only these two general varieties, things and their spirit are changed into an endless variety of forms and features. Thus the most complex comes into being from the most simple. CEMPATHY FOR THE WORLD OF MAN AND DIALECTIC FOR NATURE As MENTIONED above, in order to know Heaven-and-earth we must prescind from our own attitudes. Heaven-and-earth must be followed as they are, and Heaven-and-earth must be master. This is very true, but Heaven-and-earth do not speak for themselves. Men make out things as they consider them to be; there is such a variety of men with so many different opinions, all trying to point out what is correct, that there will be no end if one starts to argue. Thus the only way to make progress is by acquiring knowledge by one- self. However, this self-knowledge differs with each mind, and Heaven-and-earth are really a strange thing. Indeed, when people band together, their collective tendencies are much of a kind every- where, but in the end talking is all they do together. Therefore, I shall never press my opinions upon others. Not long ago, somebody came to see me. He said there are some people who are trying to destroy my ideas. I told him that it was all right, and sent him away. After all, to come to agreement is an infinite task, yet to reject a theory is an equally endless process. What we should do is rather to inquire into the very endlessness. 64 6 L ('A). Naniwa nAL, the old name of present day Osaka and its surroundings. Ise fP1, was the old name for the present Mie Prefecture. -;j i 65 ittk 66 t &gt;</page><page sequence="20">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga Bokkyj 44I Now then, if perceptive people are trying to see Heaven-and-earth in their past and present processes, still they will find in my humble words something reasonable and their purpose will be justified. Then they can discard me much as fishing gear is laid aside after the fish have been caught, or as nets are discarded after hares have been snared. I repeat again that as men live in the world of men, it is inevitable that their intelligence be developed by contact with other men. However, in order to open our intelligence, we must learn how to make surmises and counter propositions. It is man who makes surmises about man, much as an axe is used to hew the handle for an axe. Thus by understanding what is pleasant for ourselves, we know what is pleasant to others and what is sorrow- ful for oneself is also sorrowful for others. To surmise about others from what one has not experienced himself is like guessing what water looks like from the appearances of fire, or what birds want from what fish need. Therefore, unless we use the dialectical viewpoint Chankani we cannot possibly understand that which is not in us. It is an alleged impossi- bility to sympathize (jo suruj67 with others unless we try subjectively to feel the other's situation. The meaning of sympathy is well expressed commonly by the expression that one has to pinch himself in order to feel the other's pain. But since this point has been elaborated before and many interpretations are available, I am not going to delve into it any further. (FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE DIALECTICAL VIEW Let us rather see another instance of the dialectical view which has been previously ex- plained, but now we will try to apply it to animals and plants. 'Animal' is a general name Csimei)68 for birds and beasts and 'plant' is a general name for grass and trees. Animals have senses; their bodies are warm and move freely. Plants have no senses; their trunks are cold and do not move. Since animals have within themselves some empty spaces, they can take nutrition from their upper mouth into their interior. Plants instead, having a solid structure within them, take nutrition from lower parts of their body (trunk) to their ex- terior. The core of animals is upward, while inferior parts are downwards; but plants have their core downwards and their branches upwards. Animals bear offspring by conjunction of male and female from their lower parts (open- ings), while plants reproduce by flowers and fruits from their upper parts. Animals getting up off the ground amble about, but plants grounded in the soil stand firm. The limbs of animals have a regular number and point downwards, while the branches of plants are indefinite in number and tend upwards. Animals are warm while they live and cold when they are dead. Plants are cold while they are alive and warm when they are withering. Considering now the natural scenery we see that mountains have common bases where they are joined together at their foot, and from their middle elevation they are separated at their peaks. Waters separate at their sources, join together again at their ends and sink 67 t 68 A.</page><page sequence="21">442 MONUMENTA NIPPONICA, xx, 3-4 in the middle. Concerning day and night it must be said that day manifests things on earth and conceals the things in heaven, yet night reveals things in heaven and conceals the face of the earth. Coming to the things of Heaven-and-earth, we see things in heaven are dry and float and shine brightly at night; things on earth are moist and sink and are in the shadows during the day. Thus all things of Heaven-and-earth are antithetical and there is no end in enumerating their opposites insofar as we are not able to exhaust everything which is in Heaven-and- earth. Therefore, without a dialectical view it is impossible to know heaven, and without subjectively generalizing human beings, man cannot be known. Being born as a human being, a man with all his talents can perhaps outstrip those of former generations; but though his eyes are trying to penetrate to the farthest corner of Heaven-and-earth, still he cannot escape from his human limitations. Thus whether in learning or in cultivating ourselves, we are always involved in a human situation. CSOCIAL ETHICS: THE CONCLUSION In this way, whether at home or in society, whether one has the high position of a lord or the low one of servant or maid: it is always a problem of human relations. That is to say, it is a relationship of filial piety and brotherly respect (kJtei), or loyalty (chgshin9, of propriety (reigi) and honour (renchi :69 lit., sense of shame). Should one try to establish a way of life outside these human relations, and by so doing impair human relations, he would do much harm to the whole realm. Therefore, there is no greater way for humanity than to make people contented and at peace; and there is no work more excellent than to benefit the people. Doing this every- one from the emperor (kami ichinin) down to the masses (okuchYj,70 notwithstanding their different social standing, would learn from the virtue of heaven, which generates things ceaselessly. In order not to impair things given by heaven, one has to aim at helping along the creativity of nature according to each one's status and ability. Doing so, they would not go against the great virtue of Heaven-and-earth. When a man is born he has already in himself a part of Heaven-and-earth; his own konrin is established and he is vivified by his own spirit of utsubotsu and he possesses power over his inferiors. Notwithstanding his power, if he loses his virtue, the human feeling (ninjo)71 of his subjects would become excited like the boiling water in a pot; and then there would be nowhere to use his authority. The heart of his utsubotsu as well as the body of his konrin, united though they are in identity and difference, are not exactly the same. It is just like the faces of a thousand men; their minds, while being possessed of a certain human sameness, are quite different in each individual. Therefore, in order to study the way to get on in the world, one must assent to the clear 69 ;4 %, &gt; , * g 70 _ - A,,, f k_$ 71 A l</page><page sequence="22">TRANSLATION: PIOVESANA; Taga IBokkyo 443 ideas and to mind. However, unless he comes to understand well the changes of human feelings, his study will come to naught. It is said that the loss of virtue in people is due to shortage offood. This may well be so. At any rate, whatever conditions prevail in the world: unrest or peace, reliefor destruction, joy or sorrow, crying or singing: all are the action of the utsubotsu in each person. Thus if one understands well the action of utsubotsu, he will be able to govern himself and do good to others. He will be forever in harmony with the Will of Heaven (temmei).72 With consideration An'ei Hinoto-tori Rogetsu Futsuka73 (February the 2nd of the year I777).
