Others will find much that is enjoyable but should beware of jumping to conclusions on the basis of a translation that may represent only one of a number of possible solutions to a problem. Nevertheless, the translation as a whole will undoubtedly make al-Tabar's work available to a wider audience and one imagines that its appearance will espe- cially excite non-Arabist historians of late anti- quity and of the transition from Hellenistic to Islamic civilization in the Mediterranean world and the Middle East. Perhaps the most import- ant thing to be said about th whole, and an indication of scholars who have been accusl with the Ta'rFkh as a main sou to make use of the translatic with the Arabic. It is an ii plement to the Arabic text. e translation as a its value, is that tomed to working irce will now have )n in conjunction idispensable sup- G. R. HAWTING AzIz AL-AZMEH: Arabic thought and Islamic societies. (Exeter Arabic and Islamic Series.) [xvii], 295 pp. London: Croom Helm, 1986. Â£29.95. This is a kaleidoscopic work in which Professor Azmeh, eschewing chronology, draws freely from all branches of the Islamic intellec- tual tradition in order to convey the essentials of a world view. Such an enterprise necessarily and repeatedly raises the problem of how to achieve an adequate level of generalization while hold- ing on to the diversity and the tensions which existed within the Islamic as within all human society. In responding to this problem Azmeh has adopted (or created) a style so remarkable that it threatens to become itself the major characteristic of the book, a style which more demands illustration than comment. Here, in a chapter entitled ' Relations of creation, sympathy and analogy ', he introduces a subsec- tion entitled 'God and man' (p. 64). (I omit only a parenthesis.) The correlativity of microcosm and macro- cosm intimates the thesis, rejected by some for ideas unconnected with the implicit metaphysic of the two worlds, that God and man are correlative. Humanity, through Adam, is a khilafa of God, according to famous Qur'anic pronouncements, and the caliphate is an agency of God, which implies both continuity and transference, and this in turn implies, and indeed requires, considera- tions of homology and isomorphy, despite the doctrinal complications that Ash'arites felt acutely when dealing with this matter. The centrality of humanity and its represen- tational relationship to God can be seen as grounded in an ontological community, and this position was held, we saw, by representa- tives of pantheistic monism which is one possible variant of the chain of being. Con- tinuity in the opposite sense is not very dif- ferent. Instead of looking at man as homolo- gous to God and metaphysically continuous with Him- ... we could well look at anthropomorphism as a correlative, whereby man and God are taken for homologues. The continuity here is not only what we may describe as a seminal one, with God creating man and everything else, physically, and out of nothing, but is also a continuity in analogy. One is the metonym of the other. This clarity of argument and sensitivity to words is sustained throughout. The referential correctness of some of Azmeh's observations is not immediately clear. Here, in a subsection entitled 'Knowledge and its object', he tries to pin down the essentials of the Islamic attitude to knowledge (p. 109). Knowledge is an activity, not the content of such activity as discourse exercises; it has no special and privileged ontological reality. Knowledge as such has no particular quid- dity, except within the context of a rare Platonism where it was an assembly of arche- types and part of an ontology, not an epis- tomology. The absence of an epistemology in medieval Arabic thought as distinct from psychology or linguistics is the correlative of this state of affairs which, contrary to the duality of mind and matter with which Car- tesianism inseminated modern thought and culture, did not conceive of reality and knowledge as states of differential quiddity. These are highly original observations to which few will fail to respond. Not all, however, will agree on the intimated absence of epistemology in medieval Arabic thought. The following is, perhaps, less original. It incorporates what I would tentatively assess to be a correct judge- ment on 'traditionalism' with a number of broader issues, including, and not least, an affirmation of commitment (p. 181). Traditionalism has a rationality which is proper to itself, and which is no less compel- ling than positivist or syllogistic rationality. Traditionalism can assimilate anything by means of its rationality, for in the aid of this rationality is a fact already mentioned, that any singular text is inexhaustible and infinitely interpretable. Traditionalist ration- ality is distinct from the syllogistic; we must eschew culturalist narcissism, and realise that traditionalist rationality is not necessarily a privation of triumphalist positivism or of the syllogistics. The rejection of such narcissism would seem to spring not only from the rigorous compulsion of historical rationality, but from the inter-connection of rationalities. For after all, just as in the positive sciences there is no room for theory as such, as the event and the explanation are coterminous, logic itself is a repeatable transformation which is both rule and instance, and logical inference proceeds by the citation of a struc- tural similarity on which inferences are sup- posed to be based-a sort of solipsistic self- justification, an analogy in which logic is grounded and of which it is a form. Who would gainsay this? Azmeh tilts, in his preface (pp. iv-vi), at the windmills of Orientalism (they are not giants these fiddlers on the verges of two cultures) and proposes ' to revise the present state of scholar- ship in medieval Arabic thought' by incorporating into the discipline 'what has become the common stock of historical and other social and human sciences'. Like the 128 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS famous Don, he has both ideals and enemies; he issues challenges. It is indeed the generality which modern historical sciences can generate which permits the scholar to study fields on which no suf- ficient monographic work exists, as is the case with many topics addressed in the present work. Given this situation, it is perhaps not surprising that the conceptual tools used are not as finely tuned and as thoroughly employed as the author would have wished; but such is the hazard of all exploratory work, that it cannot be as consummated as it ought to be, and that it provokes sanc- timonious territorialist instincts especially as the field has so far been fragmentarily studied and researched (Preface, p. viii). Perish the sanctimonious, and the territorialist. This book is a tour de force; it creates its own space. NORMAN CALDER JAN-OLAF BLICHFELDT: Early Mahd- ism: politics and religion in the for- mative period of Islam. (Studia Orientalia Lundensia, Vol. 2.) xii, 137 pp. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1985. Guilders 48, $21.75. Title and subtitle of this monograph should be reversed. It mainly offers a study of aspects of politics and religion in early Islam after the death of Muhammad until the Shi'ite revolt of al-Mukhtar in favour of the Mahdi Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya. Only the introduction deals with Mahdism as such. The author sees recur- rent Mahdist movements as a characteristic feature of Islamic history. He suggests that the emergence of the idea of the Mahdi following the death of the caliph 'Umar still needs proper explanation. While much scholarly work has been devoted to the description of various Mahdist movements and to the study of the relevant theological literature, which he quali- fies as tedious (p. 13), there is still a need to place the idea in a wider context of Islamic history, to investigate the 'particular set of social and political conditions' from which it emerged. This is the proposed aim of the author's study. The main section of the book dealing with this historical setting is divided into two parts, the first of which is entitled 'The founding and development of the Islamic Principle of the Body Politic '. The author argues that the initial message of Muhammad was a spiritual, otherworldly one, essentially a warning of the nearness of the Day of Judgement. This was later, after Muhammad's emigration to Medina, transformed so as to found a ' political action program', by 'changing the notion of time in the sense that the dreadful Judgement to come was anticipated' into the presence of Muhammad's followers. In practical terms, this meant making promises of material reward in return for readiness and willingness to fight. 'This was indeed a stroke of genius, for by introducing the preliminary phase of the coming battle (Muhammad) was now able to engage his adherents, tribal affiliations such as the Medinan ansdr, and potential supporting groups in a confrontation with the various enemies without violating his original religion' (pp. 48-9). The 'stroke of genius' thus turns out to cover a rather Machiavellian plot for perverting the original, otherworldly message and harnessing the duped converts into solid worldly action. This 'ideological strategy con- ceived by the Prophet' (p. 43) worked well and was, after his death, pursued and developed by 'his oldest and most devoted adherents', the early caliphs and their Qurayshite advisers who defeated the movement of Apostasy (ridda) and initiated the great Islamic conquests. This caricature of the early development of Islam rests on a dichotomy between this world and the hereafter which religious tradition, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim alike, does not accept in this form. Divine judgement, reward, and punishment have always been seen as tak- ing place both in the present world and the hereafter. Muhammad's earliest message by no means neglected the reward and punishment of his present world by stressing the coming of the Day of Judgement. That after the hijra he devoted much of his attention to the political organization of his community was a natural development rather than ' a stroke of genius'. The second part is entitled' The decline of the Islamic Principle: the introduction of religious arguments in political conflicts'. The author holds that as a result of increasingly severe conflicts among the various groups of early and later settlers in the Arab garrison towns, in particular Kufa, the Islamic Principle as con- ceived by Muhammad and applied by the early caliphs lost its effectiveness and various interest groups began to make up their own religious arguments to support their political claims and social protest. In particular some of the early settlers who had little tribal backing and were now under increasing pressure from powerful tribes and massive later immigration could only turn to such religious argument. They largely made up the so-called qurrd', the Qur'an readers. True to his view about the initial development of Islam, the author suggests that these qurrd', in contrast to the early Meccan Companions who had joined Islam 'because they had sincerely believed in the religious teachings and the mission of the Prophet' (p. 60), were not motivated by the religious idea behind the call to Islam to any significant degree. 'After all, most of these men did not belong... to the immediate Medinan setting or environment, but to that group of outsiders who were talked into the movement by means of promises of various forms of reward in this world' (p. 84). No wonder then that they put forward strange ideas of political theology, including 'the most extraordinary of them all, the appearance of the term al-mahdi' (p. 90). The term, meaning 'the rightly guided one', was derived from the concept of hudd 'guidance', which had been important in Muhammad's own message. In calling Muham- mad b. al-Hanafiyya al-Mahdi and claiming to have been sent by him, al-Mukhtar was, moreover, 'seeking to institutionalize the " right" to represent the interests of the Pro- phet's religion and its community through Muhammad's progeny' (p. 127).
