HANFMANN</page><page sequence="2">This paper was read in a slightly shorter version at the symposium on "The Hellenistic Origins of Byzantine Civiliza- tion" held at Dumbarton Oaks in May 1962. The purpose of the symposium was exploratory; the purpose of this paper was to provide a sketch of the Hellenistic background for Professor Ernst Kitzinger's discussion of Hellenistic elements in Byzan- tine art. Professor Kitzinger and I had agreed on certain themes, which in turn have determined the character of my presentation. Given the tentative nature of this essay, I have not tried, in preparing it for publication,' to conceal the fact that this was a symposium paper designed for oral delivery. It seems hardly necessary to add that "Remarks on Some Aspects of Hellenistic Art" would describe more adequately what I have attempted than the sweeping title of "Hellenistic Art" under which the paper appeared on the symposium program. 1 I have profited from discussions with Professor E. Kitzinger and from papers presented by members of my seminar on Hellenistic Art in the spring of 1962. For help in securing photographs I am indebted to Giacomo Caputo, Jean Charbonneaux, Pierre Devambez, Hans Mobius, and Richard Stillwell. Philippa D. (Mrs. Judson T.) Shaplin aided me in preparing the manuscript. The footnotes are designed only to provide references to easily accessible illustrations. In prin- ciple, I have cited M. Bieber for sculpture and L.

Pergamon is the only major artistic center of which we have some coherent evidence. Few great original works of sculpture have survived, and the loss of Hellenistic painting is apparently well-nigh irreparable. Furthermore, the leading achievements of Hellenistic art were concentrated in a few areas and were accomplished by a limited number of individuals. There is a striking discrepancy between the mediocrity of local material found in excavations of Hellenistic sites and the art of high caliber which determined the course of artistic development. New discoveries have been made, but have not radically changed the situation. Thus, the mosaics of Pella, which may be expected to represent the highest artistic level in this medium (fig. 6), teach us that the transition from decorative concept of the mosaic, prevalent in the Classical Age, to imitation of monumental painting was beginning around 300 B.C.2; but they cannot be taken as evidence for the major accomplishments of the lead- ing painters of that era. The Hellenistic paintings of Kazanlik (fig. 2) reveal a surprisingly bold exploration of perspective illusion in the chariots dashing around a dome, and prove that such motifs of the Fourth Pompeian style (fig. I) had Hellenistic forerunners.3 They confirm that majestically enthroned figures placed in a diagonal position to the foreground, such as are later feat- ured in the paintings of Boscoreale,4 are indeed Hellenistic. In draftsmanship, use of color, and use of light, however, these paintings of Kazanlik are obviously the work of provincial craftsmen on the same simplifying level as the painted stelae of Pagasai or Alexandria.5 It remains true that we do not know a single first-rate Hellenistic painting which can be dated earlier than the first century B.C. 2 Ph.

HANFMANN CHRONOLOGY AND PERIODIZATION Although Hellenistes was a term known to antiquity, "Hellenistic period" is a modern term.6 In history, as in art history, it is often understood to en- compass the time between the death of Alexander the Great (323 B.C.) and the Battle of Actium (31 B.C.). Ancient art critics of the first century B.C. and first century A.D. held a somewhat different view. They followed a Class- icistic theory in which the sculptor Lysippos, the painter Apelles, and their students were still accounted exemplary and (in our sense) "Classic." Pliny's famous statement, inde cessavit ars, implies that the era between 296-293 and 156-153 B.C., the very period which modern art critics regard as the height of Hellenistic art, was a deplorable lapse.' In this particular passage (Natural History, XXXIV: 52), Pliny discusses sculpture, but other statements by Cicero, Quintilian, and Pliny himself indicate that similar views prevailed with regard to painting.8 In an interesting seminar paper, John Kroll has pointed out that among the paintings mentioned by Classical authors, Clas- sical pictures heavily outnumber Hellenistic works; the majority of those mentioned are of the Late Classic period and of the time of Alexander the Great. Indeed, the number of certifiably Hellenistic paintings of the third and second century B.C. cited by ancient authors is surprisingly small.9 This lack of evidence makes a rather emphatic contrast to the glowing recreations of the Alexandrian, Antiochene, and Asiatic schools of Hellenistic art conjured by some modern scholars. On the other hand, ancient opinions indirectly su stantiate my view that Hellenistic painting, though rich in quality, may have been limited in quantity; and the dominance of a Classicistic theory in late Republican and Early Imperial writers and art critics makes it probable that the majority of monumental paintings imitated in Pompeii and Herculaneum were selected from the creations of the time considered by these ancient critics the Golden Age of painting-namely the fourth and the early third century B.C.10 Modern periodization of Hellenistic art based on stylistic analysis of major works of sculpture presents a more persuasive conceptual scheme and, with the possible exception of the latest phase, does better justice to the artistic phenomena. In this modern view, the time of Alexander the Great and the first half of the third century B.C. constitute a phase of transition in which are found, side by side, artists whose work emphasized continuity with the 6 Hellenistes, Acts 14: i, cf. M. Bieber, The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age, revised ed. (1961), p. 3ff. 7 A. W. Lawrence, "Cessavit ars," Milanges Ch. Picard, vol. 2, RA, Ser. VI, 31-32 (1949), PP. 581-585, suggests Pasiteles as the author. Brunn's argument that Pliny's source was Xenokrates, who stopped at this point, is irrelevant; other sources were available. 8 Quintilian, Inst. Or., XII: 10, 2-6. Cicero, Brutus, 18:70. The Elder Pliny's book on painting (XXXV) leaves the same impression. 9 Ruling out the controversial Timomachos of Byzantium, there are left Antiphilos, who was per- haps still considered Classic, Epigonos, Artemon, the notorious Demetrios ho Topographos, and a few anecdotal references datable to that period. 10 J. Kroll had the ingenious idea of compiling a "Popularity Index" based on frequency of refer- ences in ancient authors. All but two or three of the first twenty are either fifth century or fourth (reaching into the beginning of the third). Nealkes of Sikyon is the only clearly Hellenistic painter and he figures in nineteenth place. Timomachos is in eighth place; if he was a contemporary of Caesar, he would be considered acceptable by Classicists.</page><page sequence="5">HELLENISTIC ART 81 Late Classic style, as in the followers of Praxiteles, and pioneering revolu- tionaries who broke sharply with the ideals of the Classic, as for instance Polyeuktes in his statue of Demosthenes, dated 280-279 B.C.11 There follows the "High Hellenistic" phase of that superb, monumental, and dynamic style which, for us at least, is best reflected in the sculptured works of the Pergamene and Rhodian schools (fig. 5, Victory of Samothrace).12 This phase appears to have lasted from ca. 250-150 B.C. The term "Hellenistic Baroque" suggests something of its character, just as the term "Hellenistic Rococo" evokes associations which are at least partly relevant to a movement that, although beginning perhaps as early as the late third century B.C., reached its height in the second half of the second century.13 Thereafter the artistic situation became more complicated. The "Baroque" current, equivalent in art of the "Asianic" manner in oratory and literature, continued, but it experienced increasing competition from the rising Classicism. Sulla (138-78 B.C.), the first Roman patron of art on an imperial scale, seems to have favored Hellen- istic regal Asianism-it was from the temple built by a Hellenistic King Antiochus IV (175-163 B.C.) that Sulla carried off columns for his reconstruc- tion of the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol; the image for Sulla's temple was made by his "court sculptor" Apollonios, son of Nestor, who, on the evidence of his surviving work (torso Belvedere, seated boxer), followed the "Baroque" manner, albeit in a lamer, disintegrating mode. Thus again, the famous mosaic given by Sulla to the temple of Fortuna Primigenia in Praeneste was, according to Gullini's recent researches, a Late Hellenistic work.14 Caesar and then, more consciously and programmatically, Augustus favored Classicism, but Pliny the Elder's (A.D. 24-79) extravagant admiration for the Laocoon, "the work to be preferred to all that sculpture and painting have produced" (N.H., XXXVI: 37), and the extraordinary assemblage of "Baroque" Rhodian sculpture in the Flavian decoration of the cave at Sperlonga15 prove that under Nero and the Flavians the Asianic current of Hellenistic art came into its own again. There are many excellent reasons to place the end of the Hellenistic age and Hellenistic art around 30 B.C. or, more generally, at the beginning of the reign of Augustus. Yet this does not do justice to the complexity of the artis- tic situation, especially in the long view which is concerned with survival and 11 The decisive clarification of major stylistic phenomena was largely the work of G. Krahmer, whose articles are cited by M. Bieber, p. 203, especially "Stilphasen," Rem. Mitteilungen, 38-39 (1923-24), p. 138ff., overelaborated by V. Miiller, "Chronology of Greek Sculpture," AB, 20 (1938), p. 359ff. My own views on the development to ca. 40 B.c. are presented in JHS, 65 (1947), P. 45ff. For Demosthenes, cf.

I propose to treat the first century B.C. and the first century A.D as the third and final phase of Hellenistic art-which was at the same time the first phase of Im- perial Roman art. For "two souls dwell in the breast" of the art of the Early Empire (L. Curtius). The truly Roman creative achievements stem from the demands of the Roman state, of the Roman Empire, and from special institu- tions of the Roman society. Such are the demands for an architecture com- mensurate with the authority of the Roman state, for reliefs advertising the Roman mission in history, and for portraits which maintain the uniqueness of the individual. On the other hand, particularly in the private sphere, Hellen- ization of the entire cultural mode and tenor in a highly diversified process of imitation, adaptation, and synthesis was carried on by artists who were repre- sentatives of living Hellenistic traditions.'" Some of the striking creative accomplishments of the age were logical consequences of developments initiat- ed by earlier periods of Hellenistic art; this is true of the exploration of optic devices in architectural painting of the second and the fourth Pompeian "styles," of the spatial enlargement of panoramic landscapes peopled by small figures, and of the brilliant development of coloristic illusionism. THE ROLE OF HELLENISTIC ELEMENTS IN LATER ROMAN ART In the three centuries between A.D. Ioo and 400 the Roman Empire produced a phenomenal quantity of largely unified "Imperial Roman" art. But the direction of the development is reversed from the Hellenistic exploration and observation of man and nature toward an increasingly abstract bias. At first imitation of earlier arts is to the fore. The second century A.D. has left to us the largest number of copies of Greek statues, and the imitative character of sarcophagi reliefs is well known.16a Then the huge naturalistic vocabulary of the Greek tradition is reduced and operated on an abstract basis,"' in com- positions based on abstract themes (figs. 3, 4). Finally, the vocabulary itself is simplified and made abstract. In the West, this development is dramatized and accentuated in the crisis of the third century A.D.; in the East, especially in Asia Minor and Syria, as is 16 On the general problem, cf. K. Schefold, "Pompejis Tuffzeit als Zeuge fiir Begriindung r6mischer Kunst," Festschrift B. Schweitzer (1954), e.g. p. 31o. It has often been stated that the names of Roman artists are usually Greek; what has not been emphasized is that in the process of acculturation, in Rome as in the United States, there was a fundamental difference between the "first generation" who came from active Hellenistic art centers, and the second, third, etc, generations of artists who had grown up with or under the Romans; a Greek name means very much less in the second century than in the first. For the material cf. G. M. A. Richter, Proceed. Amer. Philos. Soc. 95:2 (1951), p. i84ff. J. M. C. Toynbee, Some Notes on Artists in the Roman World, Coll. Latomus, 6 (I95I). 16a An interesting attempt to show the abstract approach to subject matter (allegories of virtues and the like) conditioned the formulaic use of Greek figurative motifs on Roman sarcophagi is made by K. Schefold, "La forme cr6atrice du symbolisme fun6raire des Romains," RA (I96I): 2, p. I78ff. 17 The juxtaposition of the Pompeian copy of a painting of ca. 300 B.C., fig. 3, showing Achilles surrendering Briseis and the rearrangement and reduction of the same original in the third century A.D. mosaic from Antioch, fig. 4, illustrates one phase of the process.

The end does not come until after the reign of Heraklios (A.D. 610-641). As the stylistic foundations of art were changing from the natural and organic to the symbolic and abstract, the traditional Hellenistic types and themes were driven into the ever narrowing area of secular or "educational" (as in illustrations of authors) art.1s The truly creative energy of the age was chan- neled into the service of visualizing the Christian universe and symbolizing the Christian faith. FACTORS LIMITING A COMPARISON OF HELLENISTIC AND BYZANTINE ART. ESSENTIAL TRAITS OF HELLENISTIC ART In an attempt to make the vast subject manageable, Professor Kitzinger and I have agreed to limit our discussion to certain major themes. I shall try to combine this attempt to seek out what was and what was not of interest to Byzantine artists with some intimation of what I conceive to be some of the essential traits of Hellenistic art. Thus we may hope to avoid an undue displacement of emphasis. Nevertheless, some of the major limitations of this procedure must be indicated. To make any useful comparisons with Byzantine art, we must emphasize pictorial media; yet the basic intuition of Hellenistic art was still plastic, and the plastic, three-dimensional human figure held the center of the stage. Then again, the focal themes of Byzantine art are the Sacred Image and the Sacred Cycles of the Old and New Testament. Neither the cult image nor the mythological, biographical cycle are the most expressive vehicles of Hellenistic creativity. Its full grandeur and splendor revealed itself in divinely hallowed, sacral but not sacred, atmosphere of heroic myth, and, on a more comprehensive scale, in complexes in which nature, architecture, sculpture, and probably painting were united for the sake of the total effect in a new sense of an immediate (as against the Classic distanced) nature-given reality. The Victory of Samothrace (fig. 5) sweeping down from a mountain to alight on a "real" ship over the real water of a fountain pool, the Gauls of the great Attalid dedication fighting their defiant battle against the backdrop of the grand vistas of the eagle eyrie of Pergamon, and the Eros, asleep on his "real" rock (fig. 7), these seem to me to represent the essence of Hellen- istic achievement.19 If we look for their common denominator, it is vitality, vis vitalis, heroic or idyllic, manifesting itself within the framework of the vast diversity of nature, which is the true hero of Hellenistic art. Is I have remarked on the progress toward abstraction in the art of the Roman Empire in The Season Sarcophagus in Dumbarton Oaks (1951), pp. 137f., 142f., 2Ioff., where I have also noted the parallelism with formalization of literature and education. For the secular and educational aspects of Roman art, the mosaics and the manuscripts provide the best examples. Cf. in general K.

A. HANFMANN EROTICISM Eroticism pervades Hellenistic art. If any divine powers other than Tyche enjoyed universal and popular interest, it was Eros, Aphrodite, and Dionysos. Hellenistic poetry played countless variations on the theme of the mischievous god of love, sometimes baby, sometimes a small boy, who hits indiscriminately with his arrows, burns lovers with his torch (fig. io), and is in turn punished (fig. 16), his bow broken, his wings clipped.20 A world of infantile fantasies transforms myth and daily life, as when erotes play at adult work.21 Starting from the theme omnia vincit Amor, the erotic invasion of myth brings before us erotes who take away the armor of the god of war and the club of the strongest of mortals, Herakles.22 In myth after myth, heroic couples are turned into sentimental lovers.23 Almost every story is seized upon as an occasion for revelation of seductive feminine charms. Thus Dirce's white beauty rather than her tortured plight strikes the eye in the cruel story of the revenge which Amphion and Zethos took on their stepmother.24 There is frank and joyous love-play, especially among satyrs and meanads, now interpreted as nature's children (fig. 9);25 but in much of Hellenistic art we sense an overtone of sophisticated perversion. It is the only art which has openly glorified the hermaphrodite (fig. 8).26 At the other end of the spectrum, the Classic theme of tragic love is heightened in pathos, and the portrayal of inner struggle is shown in greater detail-as in the silver mirror often consider- ed a representation of Phaidra or Dido (fig. 13)27 The prominent Hellenistic contribution, however, is the sensuous intoxication with the delicate arts of love.28 20 Fig. io after G.

It is the essence of the gusty, lusty, riproaring laughter of the Old Comedy. In the Late Classical age, this tradition lived on in the Phlyax.29 Hellenistic humor is first and foremost an extension of this theatrical humor into the reality of daily life. In an amazing outburst of caricature, Hellenistic artists portrayed slaves, dwarfs, misshapen people (fig. 12), and barbarians as real-life cousins of the fantastically ugly and ridiculous people of theatrical comedy. These grotesques combine the traditional satyric approach of the comedy with keen observation, replace the stylized exaggeration of the masks with nature's quirks, and bring the new naturalistic and scientific approach to bear upon the traditional types and situations.30 This humor is not always good-natured. The Hellenistic world thought funny what we may consider cruel and brutal. In his fascinating study KTO KHRO, R. Zahn recalls that cripples and an eighty-year-old naked hag danced indecent dances for the amusement of the wedding party of a Macedonian nobleman.31 Laughter and smile, on the other hand, were glorified as expressions of an uninhibited, desirable natural state best embodied in Dionysiac beings and children (figs. 9, II, 12). Laughter as an expression of ebullient vitality achieved a positive value which was not, however, permitted to invade the traditional solemnity of heroic myth-except in little byplays involving satyrs or erotes.32 Even though this Hellenistic exploration of emotional optimism was limited and tentative, it pioneered a new approach to emotional experience-not until Rubens and Frans Hals do we again find laughter used as a joyful ex- pression of exuberant natural life.33 GENRE With the grotesques, we have already touched upon one kind of Hellenistic genre. Let us consider briefly some examples of other types. Despite their 29 Ample illustrations in M. Bieber, The History of the Greek and Roman Theater, 2nd ed.

For the general attitude, the writings of the physiog- nomici deserve to be explored. Cf. G. Krien, "Der Ausdruck der antiken Theatermasken im Pollux- katalog und der pseudoaristotelischen 'Physiognomik,"' Jahreshe/te des oesterreich. arch. Inst., 42 (1955), p. 84ff. Krien's discussion is limited to the bearing of Pseudo-Aristotelian Physiognomica, a Hellenistic treatise, upon the Hellenistic types of theatrical masks. D. G. Mitten is preparing a study on grotesque and caricature in ancient art. 31 Athenaeus, IV: 130 c. R. Zahn, "KTO XPO", 8i. Winckelmannsprogramm Berlin (1923), p. 9ff. 32 Cf. H.

Kenner, P-. 93 f., emphasizes the rarity of laughing figures and concludes that only satyrs, centaurs, comedy masks, and children--non-human, or not-yet-human beings--were permitted to display laughing faces because an ideal of emotional restraint dominated Greek art. This does not quite do justice to the situation in the Hellenistic age. 33 As, for instance, the young Pan in the Telephos picture, Curtius, p. 230ff., fig. 3. M. M.

HANFMANN intensive observation of "low life" the "Street Musicians" by Dioskurides of Samos (fig. 14) are conceived in the spirit of the satyric grotesque.34 The brilliantly painted "Woman and Shepherd" (fig. 15), on the other hand, have been conjectured to represent a mythological scene from the Wanderings of Demeter.35 Daily life or humanized myth ?-that this question can arise is characteristic of the Hellenistic age. Certainly humanization of myth was progressing in the arts. This desire to make the divine tangible, detailed, and concrete need not lead to lack of belief. Thus it has been said of Dionysos that while the divine child becomes ever more sacred, its representations become ever more human.36 The theme of mother and child, on which Professor Kitzinger will touch in his paper, discloses something of the Hellenistic approach to humanization of myth and, at the same time, reveals some interesting traits of the attitude of the artists toward the theme of motherhood. There is genuine human appeal in such pictures as that of Danae nursing little Perseus37 after she and her baby have been rescued from their floating box by the two fishermen, who look on with astonishment and sympathy; but the picture is not primarily a symbol of tender relation between Mother and Child. Rather it is a humanized visualization of a certain incident important for the mythological story. That nursing mothers are often figures of the Dionysiac thiasos, that tender scenes of women fondling babies show not mothers but benevolent nymphs, that Eros and Aphrodite are the son and mother most frequently shown (fig. 16), that scenes of tenderness sometimes turn out to be erotic-as in the baby cupid sitting in Psyche's lap (fig. 10, right)38-all of this suggests that mother- hood as such was not being glorified. Indeed, in a recent study on Birth and Childhood of Divine Children39 J. Laager has concluded that in the Olympian mythology the mother-child relationship tends to fade into the background in favor of a male protector of the child-a Hermes (fig. 17),40 a Silenus (fig. 18).41 Hellenistic art impartially humanizes and sentimentalizes both-the mother as well as the male protector. 34 Curtius, p. 337 ff., pl. 9, considers it a theatrical scene.

Here the mythical and sacral overtones are an integral part of the vision of an idyllic land of shepherds and wanderers, not the real shepherds and wanderers but the shepherds of the Theocritean idylls. Sometimes this idyllic land is shown for its own sake (fig. 19).42 Sometimes it forms the setting for a mytho- logical narration such as Odysseus' wanderings through the countryside, the portrayal of which became fashionable in Late Hellenistic Rome.43 The very sketchiness of the pictorial technique enhances the dreamlike quality which is still ideal in a thoroughly Greek-but not in a Classical-way. What is missing here from the point of view of genre is not naturalistic observation but the direct, factual statement such as we encounter in untutored Roman folk art and in the Vienna Genesis (fig. 20), where camels behave like real camels, sturdy and mean,44 in contrast to the evanescent vision of a camel as seen in the Yellow Frieze of the House of Livia (fig. 19). The "sacral-idyllic" landscapes bring us to the problem of Hellenistic land- scape in general. No subject is more controversial. This discussion must center on the famous Odyssey landscapes, certainly the most highly developed renderings of landscape which have come down to us from antiquity (fig. 21). P. H. von Blanckenhagen has argued that these pictures are derived from an earlier frieze-like Hellenistic painting which was not interrupted by columns or pilasters; the Yellow Frieze in the House of Livia and some other "sacral- idyllic" landscapes have been cited in support of this view.45 These putative Early Hellenistic landscapes remain phantoms. We must, I believe, accept this astonishing performance for what it is-a monument of the Hellenistic landscape painting in its latest, Roman phase. The most signifi- cant aspect of the Odyssey pictures is the sense of pantheistic vastness of nature, a nature which achieves importance equal, if not superior to the myth. This nature still receives its final animation from men; but the heroic mood is now nature's, not man's. The perennial life of the universe will go on, even when the Odyssey has ended. In their comprehensive scope and sweep, the Odyssey landscapes are unique; but something of the same marriage of myth and nature in a poetic mode 42 Yellow frieze, House of Livia, after P. Marconi, La pittura dei Romani (1929), fig. 78. Cf. Mon- umenti della pittura antica scoperti in Italia, Sez. III: III, pl. 7 (color plate). The most recent, sensitive appreciation of "idyllic" landscapes is at hand in P. H. von Blanckenhagen and Chr. Alexander's The Paintings from Boscotrecase, RM, Suppl. 6 (1962). Von Blanckenhagen's evaluation, p. 6of., agrees so closely with mine that it is perhaps relevant to observe that neither of us had an opportunity to consult the work of the other. 43 Vitruvius VII, 5, Ulixis errationes per topia, which are, however, mentioned under megalographiae. 44 P.

In literature a similar chord, struck first in the descriptions of the Isles of the Blest, echoes in the "Blessed Landscapes" of Hellenistic romances.46 In the celebrated picture of Paris on Mount Ida (fig. 22), the theme is "an ideal shepherd in hallowed solitude of the mountains," not the hero or the villain of the tragedy of Troy. It is this overtone of ideality of a dream-land as remote as Paradise which seems to have inspired Byzantine artists in Ravenna to adopt such a "Landscape with Shepherd" for the portrayal of the Good Shep- herd;47 but as may be readily seen by the Roman rendering of the subject in Hadrian's Villa, the Christian mosaicists drew their inspiration not from the pantheistic interpretations of Hellenism, with their small figures and large, panoramic landscape, but from the simplified "middle-scale" interpretations of the Roman period (fig. 23).48 In other Late Hellenistic representations, the ideality of the framework is less obvious and the specific character of the setting is elaborated, with some borrowings from the cartographic tradition. Civilized urban life is made part of this picture of the oikoumene when the so-called "city formula'"49 is added to panoramic vistas of sea and rock. Here again, in varying degree, the setting is more prominent than the action. The fall of Icarus is only an incident in the continuous life cycle of man and nature (fig. 24).50 Potentially, this kind of animated landscape was adaptable to historic narration. In the Jonah scene of the Paris Psalter (fig. 25), the artist seems to have been strongly impressed by the vision of an ancient "city by the sea" (fig. 24). Indeed, the miraculous delivery from the belly of the whale becomes almost incidental. There are other striking resemblances; the little boat with the spectators here turned into boatmen who throw a sacklike Jonah overboard, the upward thrusts of gesturing hands transformed from astonished comment into pious urgency of prayer, the lofty place of the luminous divinity in the upper regions of the picture--in one Helios, in the other the hand of God in sunlike orb. Here, for once, one feels that a Hellenistic model may have been the immediate source.51 We can recall here only briefly the great variety of other Hellenistic experi- ments in suggesting spatial, physical setting. What we know of Greek geometry and optics confirms the ancient tradition that architectural drawing applied to theater backgrounds was the primary vehicle for the only consistent optic constructions which ancient painting had achieved. We are fortunate in having in a Tarentine vase of the Late Classical period a reflection of an early 46 M.

Despite their knowledge of axial perspective, Hellenistic painters never managed to detach this geometric construction from the representations of architecture and to apply it consistently to nature-made elements of landscape. The relation of landscape and figures remains in a kind of labile flux which enhances the sense of unreality. It is the unity of coloristic treatment, the dynamic play of highlights, and the sustained harmony of moods that holds this world together. ILLUSIONISM "Illusionism" is a term often used to describe the great advance made by the Hellenistic painters in conveying the impression of a world rich with color, spread out in space, and enlivened with light and shade. The term is not unambiguous-ever since Plato antiquity had felt that there is involved in pictorial representation on a two-dimensional surface an element of illusion in the sense of delusion and deceit, of showing what is not. On the whole, Hellen- istic art took a positive attitude toward this deceit. To ancient critics, the pictorial achievements of what we would term Late Classical and Early Hellenistic painting were nothing short of miraculous. To understand their enthusiasm, we must not forget that these were discoveries made for the first time in the history of mankind.

HANFMANN are preserved by Pliny (XXXV: 29), states that painting at long last differen- tiated itself from other arts, discovered light and shade, explored hue, value, and gradations as well as contrasts of colors, and then added something described as splendor and specifically said to be different from light (splendor, alius hic quam lumen). This is usually translated as "glow"; what it appears to mean is the general heightening of optical effect attained by the use of high lights as well as by coloristic devices. From our vantage point of post-impressionism and highly developed color photography, the achievements of Hellenistic painters seem curiously in- complete. Yet, even in the provincial reflection by Pompeian wall painters, such is the somnambulistic certainty in the evocative handling of the brush that a critic of the rank of a J. Burckhardt felt himself "seduced into im- pieties toward the Renaissance"60 by the brilliance and brio of the ancient Campanians. In their best work, the new pictorial means are utilized to endow the human body, by color and high light, with a pulsating life and a juicy opulence which sculpture cannot attain. "If there are any first-rate paintings in Pompeii, they are these," says a sensitive critic of this famous picture of Herakles and Omphale (fig. 30),61 part of a triptych or trilogy celebrating the power of Dionysos. The picture is quite certainly by one of the best Pompeian painters of the Fourth Style. It is equally certainly a close rendering of a Hellenistic composition of the third century B.c. At the very least it is a testimonial for the ability of painters in the Late Hellenistic-Early Roman phase of illusionism to create an effect of rich coloristic contrasts modelled in broad strokes and enhanced by generalized light. How these devices were utilized to heighten the expressiveness of a face is seen in the head of Theseus (fig. 29) from a good Pompeian rendering of a famous Late Classical original.62 Breathing life, flashing glance, such and similar terms come to mind when we view this magnificent interpretation of a hero after battle. Ancient painters never accomplished what Correggio and Rembrandt were to achieve-the visualization of vaporous atmosphere and the completely unified rendering of chiaroscuro. That they attempted night scenes at all was a revolutionary venture. What they did manage to convey with their strange and inconsistent flashing white lights is the drama of the night. The picture of the Trojan horse63 with its ghostly little silhouettes and vague masses of people is perhaps the most far-reaching attempt of antiquity to dissolve its usually plastic figures; and in the moving rendering of Priam guarding the body of Hector (fig. 31), the dark quiet of the night is used to enhance the mood of the sad vigil."4 60 Cited by Curtius, p. 22. 61 L.

The sunlit solitude of heroic mountains was perhaps never more charmingly evoked than in the picture of the shepherd and ram (fig. 32); the very sketchiness of the landscape, the insub- stantiality of the figures in the background emphasize its poetic irreality.65 To find that close-up segments of nature were considered subjects valid in their own right is even more remarkable in an art which was still anthro- pomorphic in essence. Hellenistic painting interprets still life not as nature- morte but as nature alive with a pantheistic life of which the carriers are light and color. Thus in a typical Pompeian "still life"65a the glass, with its miraculous property of responding to light, is even more alive than the animate bird. This truly is "glow and shimmer." Such Hellenistic splendor, however, is always a heightening of the natural, not a quest for the radiance of the supernatural. Hellenistic monarchs were noted for luxury and the kings of Pergamon had a monopoly on gold-woven textiles, Attalicae vestes. Gold was used to depict gold objects and to increase effects of ornamental details; but to my knowledge neither gold nor silver was ever used to produce the effect of unearthly light, not even in representa- tions of the halo which in Pompeian paintings was already used as a symbol of divine effulgence.66 EMOTION The Classical art of Greece had inaugurated a new approach to the portrayal of emotion which was made possible by the discovery of organic art and the resultant ability to establish a convincing relation between the soul and the body. Following up this breakthrough in many directions, Hellenistic artists enormously enlarged the scope and diversity of emotional situations which art might portray. Their precise observation of physical appearances and their careful studies of the relation between somatic and psychological factors enabled them to diversify the portrayal of emotions to an extent which, at first glance, appears infinite. Relaxed sleep (fig. 7) and blazing breathlessness (fig. 33) are as much within the power of Hellenistic artists as are the skilfully graduated responses in the crowd of spectators commenting on the expiring Minotaur (fig. 35).67 Nevertheless, within and underneath this seemingly 65 Fig. 32, Alinari 39 135.

A. HANFMANN realistic precision, there is always present a typical element, a belief that the general transcends the specific. Apart from the province of the grotesque, Hellenism continues to uphold the Classical belief in the beauty of man-only the human body is now fleshly and sensuously rather than neutrally and ideally beautiful. The heroic gesture still dominates, even when the emotional situation calls for brutality, suffering, and anguish (figs. 36, Laocoon; 37, Sacrifice of Iphigeneia),68 subjects the ancient critics would describe as scenes of pathos, pathe, animi perturbationes.69 For Byzantine art, the treatment of the scenes of death, grief, and lament is of particular significance; and for this reason, it may be relevant to end this discussion with some Hellenistic interpretations of the same theme. Following the precedent set by Classical art, the great majority of sepulchral monuments was concerned not with scenes of grief and lament but with perpetuation of the memory of life.70 The exception-and this is of interest for Byzantine art-are memorials of women who died in childbirth, as did Hediste, com- memorated on the Hellenistic stele from Pagasai (fig. 38).71 It is not impossible that such funerary scenes influenced the portrayals of death and burial in mythological illustrations; in an Ilias cycle, the corpse of Patroklos swathed in a shroud seems to echo the prostrate forms of dying women-and to antic- ipate curiously scenes of both death and nativity in Early Christian art.72 From literary sources we learn that the pathetic contrast of an infant and a dead or dying mother was emphatically presented in famous Hellenistic paintings and sculptures.73 This, however, is only an extension of that theat- rical spirit of pathetic tragedy which Hellenism introduced into such legends as the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe.74 In general, the heroic and mythical sphere interprets death in the spirit of life defiantly ebbing away (fig. 39) or as transition to eternal sleep.75 This grandiose, pathetic tradition is in 68 Fig. 36, Laocoon in new reconstruction after F.

Pliny, XXXV:98. It is generally conceded that the Pompeian picture of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, no. 68, cannot be a direct copy of Timanthes' Iphigeneia, although the motif of the father whose head is veiled may derive from it. This motif has been already discussed by ancient critics and those of the eighteenth century (Lessing, Fuseli) in the context of the question whether the highest degree of anguish can be expressed in art; cf. the passages cited by Jex-Blake and Sellers, The Elder Pliny's Chapters on the History of Art (1896), p. 116, on Pliny, XXXV: 73. 70 For the Classical tradition, cf.

On an Etruscan urn from Volterra (fig. 41),7there is preserved the reflection of a great Hellenistic composition showing the dead and broken but still beautiful Patroklos being lifted from the chariot. Compassion and pity speak eloquently in the group of Patroklos and the two warriors who gently lower the body of the fallen hero. A comparison with Byzantine representations of the Descent from the Cross, as for instance with the fresco of Nerezi,78 underlines both the common denomi- nator in the motif and the difference in the treatment-the quietly beautiful, subued, in a sense objective, approach in the Hellenistic work, which excludes the spectator from immediate participation, and the poignantly expressive but also symbolically demonstrative power of the Byzantine masterpiece. EPILOGUE In these perfunctory remarks I have sought to indicate something of the range of Hellenistic art which made it such a treasure house for the Romans and the Byzantines. Elaborating and enlarging the anthropomorphic art created by the artists of Classical Greece, Hellenistic art extended the poten- tial of the Classical tradition by searching observation of the variety and diversity of human types and experience. Going beyond the Classic, Hellen- istic artists discovered for the ancient world the largeness of nature and the possibility of envisaging a universe in which humanity is but a small part of a larger order. To this expanded kosmos, Hellenism added the new dimensions of textured local color, of light and shade, of splendor designed to heighten the feeling of life. Hellenistic art is a world of realistic unrealities-its major concerns are the defiant heroism of mythical and semi-mythical supermen, the sensuous and sentimental delights of love, the dream of a children's world where children play with gods and heroes; of grotesques uglier but also more exuberant than life; and-perhaps most comprehensively-the image of a sacral-idyllic world of pantheistic landscapes peopled with simple folk, whose worship of their rustic gods is uncorrupted by philosophic doubt, and whose peaceful, natural existence knows neither ambition nor strife.

HANFMANN Hellenistic art is diffused and dispersed through all phases of existence, its myth is an afterglow which, like poetry, serves to elevate man's view of his past and his present. With all this yearning for the Golden Age of innocence and for escape to bucolic nature, the general tenor of Hellenistic art is life- affirming; even death is sleep, not decay. The hedonistic view of KTO KHRO parades its skeletons to encourage the spectator to live (fig. 34), not to die.'9 In contrast to Byzantine art, Hellenistic art is entirely and enthusiastically of this world, huius mundi, with all the good and evil this might imply for devout Christians. This Hellenistic art, authentically Greek in essence,80 was doomed even without the Roman conquest-artistically, by the limits set to any naturalis- tic cycle; psychologically, by the lack of any powerful religious impetus; biologically, by its enormous geographical expansion from India to Spain, with the resultant thinning out of its carriers and the increasing erosive impact of the native attitudes and traditions. Its Roman heirs understood much of it, but not that e'lan vital which was the unifying idea of Hellenistic creativity. In the three centuries when the Roman Empire prospered (A.D. 100-400) and held sway over men's thoughts, the entire vision of life and the world changed from the heroic superman to the civis Romanus; and he in turn was transformed into a citizen of the City of God, as the interpretatio Romana of Hellenistic heritage was succeeded by interpretatio Christiana. Yet Hellenistic art "dying died not." To assess the share of Hellenistic elements in the mediaeval image of the Classical world and to trace the persistence of Hellenistic art as a latent force which, especially in the Eastern part of the former Roman Empire, could stimulate creative revivals, is a task which presents fascinating challenges to students of Byzantine art and culture. 79 K. Schefold, Die Bildnisse der antiken Dichter, Redner, und Denher, (1943), PP. I66f., 216 (goblets from Boscoreale) with references. Fig. 34, photo, M. Chuzeville. This side shows Zenon (left) pointing at Epicure, who is taking a cake from the table. The scene is inscribed: to telos hedone, "pleasure is the [highest] end." 80 I do not wish for a moment to deny the historic significance and aesthetic potential of forms developed in Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and India through fusion of Hellenistic with native elements, but the center of gravity, the artistic leadership remained in a small area--essentially the Greek islands and the Greek cities in the coastal areas of Asia Minor, with a wider "secondary" zone taking in Athens, Sikyon, Tarentum, Syracuse, Antioch, and Alexandria.</page><page sequence="19">$tt t 'Sr ~ u .? ~ ,: 4r .I .
