<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter  xii Conclusions  ‘Similar yet different’ is a recurrent phrase in my comparison of Kamoro and  Asmat. How are we to account for this paradox? As suggested by Knauft  (1993), we can resort to the dialectic between the existential and symbolic  dimensions of Kamoro and Asmat social formations, including their structur- al history. Structural history, as I see it, ‘happens’ on the borderline between  chance events and non-chance structure. Structural history is structure on the  move; it is ‘structuration’, a process of articulation and signification, which in  Durkheim’s1 words is ceaselessly forming and breaking down.  Let us draw the threads together. The Kamoro (including Sempan) and the  Asmat share as their habitat a vast, marshy coastal plain that widens, going  from a small coastal zone and hinterland in the far northwest to a broad zone  several hundreds of kilometres wide in the far southeast. This environment,  in interaction with the activities of its inhabitants, gives rise to an ecological  situation in which the carrying capacity of the land gradually increases from  northwest to southeast. In keeping with this, the average size of settlements  and their constituent groups, the Kamoro taparu and the Asmat yew, increases  as we move from northwest to southeast. The largest settlements and groups  are located about midway along the rivers east of Kaokonao, due to an opti- mal balance here between tidal and freshwater swamp. The settlements near  the coast and those further upstream are somewhat smaller. These smaller  Kamoro and Asmat settlements resemble each other, in that the number of  their taparu and yew is considerably higher than that in the much larger settle- ments. Presumably the larger number of smaller social units is due to a larger  dispersal of wild and semi-cultivated sago stands.  This ecological situation, which crosscuts ethnic boundaries, may be con- sidered the common existential dimension of the Kamoro and Asmat social  formations. It has important implications: the more manpower per settlement,  the stronger their political and military potential. Consequently, it is no coinci- dence that in the larger Kamoro and Asmat settlements to the east, which tend  to concentrate along the middle courses of rivers, competition for sago and  1 Durkheim 1900:190, as cited by Lévi-Strauss 1977:17. </page> <page sequence="2"> 232 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua fishing areas has resulted in more conflicts and warfare than in the smaller  settlements further inland and near the coast. So much for the similarities in the existential dimension of Kamoro and  Asmat social formations. Their interaction with the symbolic dimension,  however, shows a considerable difference in social formation and culture.  Kamoro conflicts and wars lacked the virulence of Asmat warfare. Asmat  warfare is inspired by a dominant orientation towards headhunting and an  obsession with revenge. This is evident in the naming of all sorts of objects of  daily use after victims of conflicts, as an incitement to take revenge. The ten- dency towards violence is also seen in the high rate of casualties and the large  amount of settlements and groups wiped out, decimated, dispersed, or inte- grated elsewhere. I presume that the historical origins of headhunting must  be sought east and southeast of the Asmat area. Take for instance the Yaqai of  the Mappi area, described by Boelaars (1981). In Part Three of his monograph,  which describes traditional headhunting practices, the author stresses the  point that headhunting was a complex, highly differentiated phenomenon  constituting the cultural focus of Yaqai society (Boelaars 1981:125-97). The Kamoro, on the other hand, display an orientation towards the per- formance of an elaborate and sophisticated cycle of rituals. Headhunting has  no place in this and has never been reported. It does not occur in myths either.  Kamoro participants tend to engage in wars and conflicts by referring to the  transgression of ritual secrets, even if the underlying cause may well be com- petition for sago and fishing areas. Violating ritual secrets is not reported as a  cause of Asmat conflicts. However, it should be noted that a reported scarcity  of sago groves may well function as social, emotional and symbolic, as well  as economic causes of conflicts. Excessive ritual consumption of two crucial  social goods, namely sago grubs and young sago-palm hearts, is a case in  point. These delicacies are considered a source of spiritual power and fertil- ity. Their production leads to massive felling of sago trees, and sometimes to  overexploitation. Most interestingly, in the far western part of Mimika a shortage of conven- tional natural resources, due to a limited hinterland and consequently limited  manpower in small settlements, went together with strong and expansive  political and military power. The lack of resources was made up for by exclu- sive access to and even a monopoly of Western and Indonesian commodities  in high demand throughout Mimika. People from the east made risky jour- neys to Mimika in the far west to acquire iron tools, textile and ornaments.  Here external history comes in. In the first quarter of the twentieth century  there emerged in Kipia, West Mimika, a commercially-oriented Kamoro raja- dom that participated in the slave trade (Pouwer 1955a:220-5); this rajadom  was at least nominally Islamic. It affected, and in the long run might have  changed, the traditional Kamoro cultural orientation, if not for the fact that  </page> <page sequence="3"> XII  Conclusions 233 the Mission and the Dutch colonial government overruled the rajadom. It may  be concluded that similar existential dimensions in dialectic interplay with  symbolic dimensions and history can result in different social formations and  cultural configurations. The Kamoro and Asmat are similar in their multiple manifestations of dual  organization and bipartition, which operate in both the existential and sym- bolic dimensions. Although the Kamoro differ from the Asmat in that their  taparu are not divided into residentially separate, exogamic, intermarrying  moieties as are the Asmat yew, about half of the settlements do consist of two  taparu. The remainder consist of parishes having two or more taparu (Sempan  yahe se) that, like the Asmat yew halves, relate to each other as downstream  to upstream. Marriage within the settlement is dominant. Taparu of limited  size are exogamous, while larger taparu/yahe se, such as in the Wania and  Sempan regions, are non-exogamous. Adjacent settlements tend to be organ- ized in pairs. We may conclude that the differences in actual dual organiza- tion between Asmat and Kamoro are a matter of scale rather than of principle.  Many taparu are simply too small to allow for exogamic, intermarrying moie- ties. Nearly perennial warfare has decimated or wiped out a good number of  Asmat settlements or yew (Zegwaard 1977:18-25) and was a constant danger  affecting social stability. In order to survive, individual or group remainders  of the ravages of warfare were often forced to join other, stronger settlements  or groups. Zegwaard repeatedly found that seemingly genuine yew are in fact  fused ones which have absorbed the remains of other yew that were forced  by violence and killing to submit to a stronger unit for the sake of survival  (Zegwaard 1977:22). Dual organization, since it overrides ties of kinship and  descent, and often operates through the individual power of yew or moiety  warlords, acquires extra emphasis in the Asmat political sphere as a flexible  instrument of survival and power. In contrast, Kamoro dual organization and  bipartition holds sway over the symbolic dimension, due to a central orienta- tion towards the cycle of rituals. Bipartition in these rituals is of vital impor- tance for Kamoro ritual, more so than for Asmat ritual. Kinship and marriage obviously operate in both the existential and the  symbolic dimensions. The Kamoro and Asmat types of kinship and descent  are roughly similar in their emphasis on ‘horizontal’, generational ties – wit- ness the Kamoro generational category of peraeko and the Asmat counterpart  of afayis cokom in combination with the pivotal ‘brothers’, ofew. Consequently,  the ‘vertical’ line of descent is shallow and not well known; it may be better  described as cumulative filiation. A residential override in combination with  interlocal and even local fragmentation, rather than segmentation of constitu- ent units, renders thorough genealogical knowledge superfluous. It is likely  that the Asmat trend towards patrifiliation is related to the central symbolic  </page> <page sequence="4"> 234 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua orientation towards warfare, headhunting and virility. The Kamoro tendency  towards matrifiliation may be connected with a strong emphasis on (female)  fertility in the symbolic dimension and on women’s powerful position in the  food quest, acknowledged by men. Kaware is a male stronghold vis-à-vis the  power of women in everyday practice. Women as workforce and as the source  of offspring and alliances are a highly valuable ‘commodity’. Bride-receivers  are therefore obliged to render a wide variety of economic and ritual services;  matri-uxorilocal marriage fits in with this pattern. In their turn the preponder- ant position of Asmat ‘brothers’ corresponds with their living together around  one ‘door’ in the men’s house. Consequently, Asmat marriage tends towards  patrilocality and virilocality. The subservient role of bride-receivers, though,  is less pronounced. Kamoro women have a higher status and a more power- ful position than their Asmat counterparts. Papish, Asmat ritual-ceremonial  wife-swapping in situations of socio-political or cosmological danger, is not  practised by the Kamoro. However, its Kamoro linguistic and cosmological  equivalent kaypiri also denotes a situation of cosmological danger, such as  travelling through unknown territory or being immersed in a foreign world  as a contract labourer in the city. It is characteristic of the Asmat central orien- tation towards revenge and war that Asmat warlords use wife-swapping not  only for counteracting cosmological danger, but also as a strategy for enlisting  the support of or remunerating allies. They talk their wives into accepting this  role. Wife-swapping as a strategy is not mentioned in the myth accounting for  papish. (It should be noted that papish is strictly regulated. Transgression of the  rules leads to conflicts and fights.) Kamoro and Asmat cosmology is by and large similar. Humans live in a  world in between the upper and the lower world. From this ‘crossover’, super- human tricksters ‘furnish’ the earth with goodies acquired from above and  below. The entrance to these abodes is paved by antisocial behaviour. Good  and bad are complementary. Their human descendants likewise manipulate  cosmological forces. There is a difference, though. I would venture the sug- gestion that such manipulation in cosmology-based ritual varies according to  the main cultural orientation. For instance, in the course of Kamoro Mirimu  Kame – the initiation of young people – as well as on other occasions, the  names of the sago areas are recited one by one with a view to manipulation.  The male sago dignitaries state that there is sago, not just that there should be  sago: it is a coercive act. They also summon two female sago dignitaries and  the sun: ‘Sun, shine upon the mature sago palms [that is, fill them with pith],  and let all areas [as specified] be replete with palms.’ A reverent attitude of  prayer is nonexistent. The male and the female sago dignitaries stride past the  houses and shoot arrows made of sago ribs by way of symbolic exhortation  to the sago spirits to do their job and fill the sago trees. Immediately prior to  the nose-piercing ceremony, the specified course of the rising sun is recited in  </page> <page sequence="5"> XII  Conclusions 235 a series of ritual statements, accompanied by a staccato of striking gestures  and passes by special dancers. This reaches its climax in shooting burning  arrows in the direction of the sun to emphasize and support the sunrise. No  mistake in the songs should be made, lest the sun not rise. The impressive sun  ceremony is part of other rituals as well, such as the bat dance, as a highlight  of Ema Kame. These and other ritual activities are meant to evoke the elements  and forces of cosmology to promote fertility and growth. The Asmat attempt  to ensure a successful raid by forcefully singing and repeating the cloud song.  The malevolent beings of the upper world and of the earthly forest are exor- cized by naming them one by one. The animal ‘brothers’ of man are similarly  invoked. Kamoro and Asmat narratives agree in locating the origin of Ema Kame/ Emak Cem in the hinterland. I venture the suggestion that in long-term history  the present Kamoro, the Sempan, and the Nafuaripi had ancestors in common.  Linguistic evidence seems to support this conjecture. Their main locations  were upstream, in the hinterland. Ema Kame/Emak Cem is likely to have  originated from them. In this respect it is noteworthy that the architecture of  the Kamoro Ema Kame ceremonial house differs from all other ceremonial  houses, including the Asmat ones. And it is perhaps no coincidence that in  the Ema Kame/Kiawa of the Kamoro/Sempan a canoe as ceremonial object is  absent, whereas it is a dominant, possibly pre-existent or coexistent, symbol in  the Emak Cem of the Asmat. Then, the more recent migrations of coastal-oriented communities from the  far eastern part of Mimika, set in motion by attacks by peoples bordering on  or living in the present Asmat territory, clashed with or merged with the pre- existing, inland-oriented communities. These migrants gradually moved to the  present Kamoro territory, where they settled as far as Etna Bay in the far west- ern part of Mimika. They might have adopted Ema Kame from their inland- oriented predecessors. Ema Kame is universal in Mimika and was added to  their coastal Kaware and nose-piercing rituals. The story of their migration  has it that some migrants retraced their steps to collect the pin (amupao) for  nose piercing in the far eastern Koperapoka coastal area, where they had left  it behind when they panicked and fled. A myth about the introduction of nose  piercing locates it in Mimika far to the east (Zegwaard 1952:47-8). Descendants of the original inland-oriented people, who did not mix  with the coastal invaders, retreated further inland, and are the present-day  Nafuaripi. They do not celebrate Kaware, nor do the closely related Sempan.  The inland- and upstream-oriented factions of Asmat, whose ancestors are  believed to have migrated long ago from areas east and northeast of their  present habitat, presumably also adopted Ema Kame/Emak Cem from these  Nafuaripi. The latter retreated to the headwaters because of attacks by the  far more powerful Asmat invaders. The coastal Asmat do not celebrate Emak  </page> <page sequence="6"> 236 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua Cem, but there has been some recent diffusion of it downstream. In view of these intricate vagaries of history and migrations, it is all the  more striking that all myths related to Ema Kame/Emak Cem, in spite of their  diversity, are similar in eliciting the paradox of human genesis: born out of  one, yet born from two. These myths also have in common that they ascribe  physical genesis to the female gender and social genesis, the genesis of differ- ent groups, to the male gender. Ema Kame/Emak Cem demarcates, at least among the Kamoro, the final  stage and climax in a gradual, ritually demarcated process of commemoration  of the dead. In the end, their bones are abandoned in the ceremonial house  and left to decay. For both the Kamoro and the Asmat, Ema Kame/Emak Cem  is a rite of passage from the living to the dead and vice versa, and from adoles- cence to maturity. The transition to adult status is marked literally by scarifica- tion. Ema Kame/Emak Cem celebrates and promotes fertility and growth, and  is therefore classified as female, and as the source of physical reproduction. There is a difference, though. Kamoro Ema Kame displays a plethora of  rituals and ritual objects expressing a female-centred and matri-centred ori- entation. One of its highlights, if not the main one, is the simulation of birth  from the vagina/navel of the ancestral mother, represented by a sacred board  in the centre of the ceremonial house, one out of two (puru mane) symbolizing  the ancestral couple. The very elaboration of a matri-centred complex of nar- ratives and rituals points to Ema Kame as an age-old institution. One of my  key informants even rated Ema Kame as the mother of all rituals. Asmat Emak  Cem is less elaborate and a matri-centred complex is missing. The sacred  boards are there, but they function merely as a deterrent. Emak Cem’s central  symbol is the spectacular spirit canoe (uramun or wuramun), which is similar  in name to puru mane, yet quite different in substance and meaning. It is a  magnificent piece of craftsmanship. Together with its associated ritual it is a  perfect symbol of the life cycle: the honoured dead are invited to depart with  the canoe to their abode in the underworld, while the initiates are marked as  their successors by scarifications applied to shoulder, back and buttock. This  happens in or in the vicinity of the ceremonial canoe. The marriageable ones  among them are marked a second time by scarifications of the chest, which are  applied in the same manner to the chests of their younger sisters. This scarifi- cation marks brother and sister as the basic pair for social exchange. So patri- filiation, patri-descent and marriage, the basic mechanisms of social continuity,  are literally carved out in a ‘female’ ritual. The origin of Emak Cem is ascribed  to two sisters who not only devise the ritual but also participate in it. For the Asmat, canoes together with war shields (yamesh) are important  components of their cultural complex of warfare, their ‘male’-centred orien- tation. The making of war shields is even the subject of a special ritual. It is  striking that for the Kamoro, shields are components of ‘female’ Ema Kame,  </page> <page sequence="7"> XII  Conclusions 237 but as strictly ceremonial objects (yamate) only, without a grip. Each of these  shields represents a male or female person who has passed away and is hon- oured during the ritual. Special shields represent the ancestors and their per- aeko descendants. Ceremonial shields are not a part of Asmat Emak Cem. So  Ema Kame and Emak Cem are similar in some respects, yet the rituals differ  in orientation. Yipae, the fascinating ‘female’ Asmat masquerade impersonating and hon- ouring selected dead persons, is strikingly similar in this respect to the Kamoro  masquerade during the spirit platform ritual. However, the number of masked  performers usually exceeds the two of the Kamoro masquerade. Seven have  been reported in one case, but the number two does come in, since the dead to  be honoured as well as their performers are chosen by the moieties. Of more  importance is the difference in purpose. Yipae is meant not only to honour the  dead but also to replace them. Relatives of the deceased adopt the performers  of the masquerade and a good number of their relatives as well. The adoption  is marked by the adoptees being provided with a bracelet. Scores of bracelets  are involved. The adoptees identify with the deceased by adopting the name  of the deceased. In this way, persons of different family groups are knitted  together and the loss of relatives by death is made up for. Yipae has a strong  socializing effect, comparable with the effect of Emak Cem ceremonies. It is  enhanced by a massive exchange of food. Its intention is clearly revealed by  the constituting narrative. An orphan who is not looked after very well helps  himself to food by donning a fun mask to scare women and men returning  from collecting sago and fish. Terrified, they leave the food behind. When  the men find out, they not only decide to remedy the evil of neglect, but also  are induced by the orphan’s ruse to start the real masquerade, this time using  sacred masks. During the ceremony a masquerade impersonating the orphan  and bringing about a lot of commotion and fun precedes the masquerade  impersonating the dead. Imu joking adds to a relaxed atmosphere. Making  up for the dead is an important feature in view of the high rate of casualties  through warfare and headhunting. It is absent in the Kamoro masquerade.  Further, the Kamoro masks are donned by bride-receivers, not by relatives.  This would be improper in the Asmat case: one should not mingle affines with  kin by means of adoption. Although armbands are also donned in the course  of the Kamoro masquerade, this is done by bride-receivers of the deceased.  They collect food delicacies to give to close relatives of the deceased in order  to alleviate their sorrow. Again, a difference in cultural orientation, in spite of  superficial similarities, is associated with a difference in deeper meaning. The complex relation of ‘male’ Kamoro Kaware to Asmat Yew Mbu/Tow  Mbu rituals was discussed in detail in Chapter IX. Here it suffices to reiterate  some conclusions. The rituals have two founding myths in common, though  in varying versions. A third Kamoro myth, about the culture hero Nokoro,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 238 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua is not shared, but an important part of its subject matter, namely the sago  grub ritual, is. However, the form and aims of these rituals vary. Interestingly,  Nokoro’s canoe, serving as a container for massive quantities of sago grubs,  turns up among the Asmat in the form of four cylindrical logs, either intercon- nected with a mat or used separately. Both serve as containers of sago grubs  coming down through a tube. However, the orientation and focus of the rituals differ markedly. The  concern of the Asmat ritual initiation of a new men’s house is the promotion  of communal strength and solidarity, explicitly including the relation between  the sexes. Their chief culture hero is Yenip-from-above (the earth). His exploits  are dramatized in the ritual. He is credited with the conversion of small dis- persed and self-seeking bands into a large powerful community, enjoying  access to abundant natural resources and the pleasure of a rich social and  cultural life. Ritual collecting of large quantities of sago grubs and their distri- bution express and promote cross-gender strength. There is a mock enactment  of warfare by males and females separately. The exploits of Fumuripic, the cul- ture hero of resurrection, are not dramatized but are commemorated in song. For the Kamoro, on the other hand, Kaware marks not the solidarity but  the opposition between the sexes. Further, it is not the myth about the Kamoro  version of Asmat Yenip that is depicted in the ritual, but rather the narrative  about the culture hero of resurrection. Nokoro, the culture hero of the third  myth, is also impersonated. He exhorts women not to neglect the men but to  take good care of them. Finally, the violent death of the hero of resurrection is  avenged in ritual by thrusting lances into the sand during the grandiose final  act of Kaware, thereby crushing the evil spirits. Kaware is a male stronghold  rather than an expression of cross-gender solidarity. Again, in spite of similari- ties, the difference in main orientation shows up. Finally, the Asmat Mbish ritual, considered in the context of the ritual of  warfare and headhunting that it was formerly part of, is the ‘male’ coastal  counterpart of ‘female’ inland Emak Cem. Both rituals combine a commemo- ration of the dead embodied in a spirit pole and a spirit dugout – a vertical  and a horizontal canoe, respectively – with initiation. Initiation in Emak Cem  involves the recognition and participation of both males and females as adults  in everyday social life, based on kinship, marriage and cumulative (patri)filia- tion. This aspect of social life relates as ‘female’ to the ‘male’ aspect of warfare  and headhunting. The initiation and social acceptance of male adolescents in  the ‘male’ sphere of social life is ritually demarcated by presenting the initi- ate with the skull of a slain enemy. The initiate is expected to identify with  the victim; he even adopts his name. Nose piercing has no place in this. This  initiation is explicitly associated with warfare and headhunting, and so is the  spirit pole. The tree selected for making it is even attacked as if it were an  enemy. Its transportation and arrival in the settlement are marked by a mock  </page> <page sequence="9"> XII  Conclusions 239 war between moieties and between all the men and the women. The women  are assembled in the men’s house: they function as the enemy. The blood of  the victim or victims of headhunting is applied to the eyes, mouth and genitals  of the carved figures. It is this act which vitalizes the carvings and gives them  their power. The ‘female’ side of the Kamoro initiation of young males as performed  in Ema Kame is similar to the Asmat one, but more elaborate. It marks their  passage to the social life of adults in terms of kinship, marriage and (matri) filiation in the same way. However, the ‘male’ aspect of initiation as apparent  in nose piercing during Mirimu Kame differs from the Asmat one. It is con- nected not with warfare but rather with fertility and growth, with cosmology  and its manipulation. Witness for instance the fact that it is performed on a  sago scaffolding, a major symbol of growth. Also, the male aspect of initiation  in Kaware is about ritual resurrection, not war. Although the naming of Kamoro and Asmat spirit poles is identical and  they both consist of three parts meant to commemorate the dead, there are  significant differences in construction and meaning. The Kamoro tripartition  of the mbitoro clearly corresponds with the tripartition of the cosmos. The cen- tral round or oval motif of the wing represents the may kame, literally ‘father’s  house’, the house of the sun hero. Zigzag openwork carvings between the sun  motif and the junction with the wing denote clouds, the transition between  the sky and the earth. Marks (otepe) of cult groups to which particular ritual  sequences are assigned are also carved in openwork on the wing. Then follows  the depiction of humans represented by the hollow carvings of a specified  deceased man and woman. The inner body (ndata) departs from the human  body, leaving only the outer covering (kao). The point at the bottom as well as  the hole in which it is inserted are puri (taboo), as they represent the transition  to the underworld. Just beneath the point of the pole, the spirits of honoured  deceased, called up by the songs, watch the festive events. The tripartition of  the Asmat mbish does not explicitly correspond with the tripartition of the  cosmos. Its top is not the wing but consists of the carving of a deceased man  from which the wing protrudes. The wing consists of openwork spirals that  denote unspecified ancestors. Anthropomorphic carvings denoting deceased  children are also part of the wing (similar to Kamoro carvings of faces denot- ing children). The abode of the sun is not indicated. The carvings of the middle  portion of the mbish correspond with those of the middle part of the mbitoro,  but the bodies are not hollow and the arms, unlike the drawn-up ones on the  mbitoro, hang down and point to the crotch, thereby referring to the scalp of a  slain man placed between the knees of an initiate (Gerbrands 1967:310-1). The  bottom part of the mbish is not inserted in the earth. It often ends in a reduced  version of the spirit canoe or in an open niche in which other male but espe- cially female ancestors are depicted with Kamoro-like bent knees. Asmat and  </page> <page sequence="10"> 240 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua Kamoro have in common that the oval icons of living/moving, respectively  bianam and mopere, are applied to the limbs. In Asmat carvings, however,  scarifications of the limbs indicating muscles, which connote physical power,  are predominant. So our conclusion with respect to anthropomorphic carving is, again, that  they are similar yet different. The Kamoro deeper meaning of tripartition  of the spirit pole clearly reflects cosmology. The Asmat tripartition reflects  ancestry. Both Kamoro and Asmat culture agree in a strong predisposition towards,  if not preoccupation with, a cult of the dead. The Kamoro take leave of the  dead in a gradual series of eight stages, including the final stage of Ema Kame.  This takes several years. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the Asmat stages  of farewell from the dead is incomplete. However, it is quite clear that the  Kamoro and the Asmat share a deep concern with the dead, since they believe  that caring for the dead is essential for living, for survival. At the same time,  their attitude towards the dead is deeply ambivalent. The dead are a basic  component of everyday life. They are honoured and deeply respected, but  also feared. The living constantly feel the need to remind the dead that they  can handle life without them: ‘You were a good hunter, provider, fisherman,  drummer, singer or storyteller, but we can manage perfectly well without you,  thank you. Now please move on and leave us alone.’ </page> </plain_text>
