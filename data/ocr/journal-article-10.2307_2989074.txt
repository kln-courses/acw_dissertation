<plain_text><page sequence="1">244 ETHICS SHORTER NOTICES FAITH FOR LIVING. By Lewis Mumford. New York: Harcourt Brace &amp; Co., I940. PP. 1x+333. $2.00. LET ME THINK. By H. A. Overstreet. New York: Macmillan Co., I939. PP. io6. $o.6o. Faith for Living, Mumford announces, is a last testament for survivors of a sinking ship, should any reach the shore. Mumford believes his last volume, Men Must Act, found its readers still too callous to appreciate the "cancerous nature of fascism" which it portrayed; but if that volume came two years too soon, the present exposition of more basic issues comes, he holds, twenty years too late to serve as anything but a last word for drowning men. At the same time he would have us follow his advice even at this latest moment and find in his credo a way to confession of our fundamental philosophic errors and to crea- tion of a new faith in life: a faith centering for the moment in belief in the urgen- cy and nobility of sacrifice,-in the dictum that ."he who loseth his life shall find it." In contrast to Mumford's despairing call for a last-minute renaissance of faith, Overstreet offers us a comfortable discussion of some problems in practical philosophy, only lightly touched by any sense of a present crisis in moral issues. One of the series called "The Peoples' Library," this volume deals with the na- ture of man's mind and its power to cope with itself and its world in terms of very homely example and precept very simply stated. Overstreet concludes, with rather amazing optimism, that though we know life is "not all cakes and ale," we have in us forces to combat the evils that sometimes threaten life's goodness: we know what life ought to be and are not without power to make it in the image of this knowledge. MARJoRIE GRENE THE STEPS OF HUMILITY. BY BERNARD, ABBOT OF CLAIRVAUX. Translated, with Introduction and Notes, as a study of his epistemology. By George Bosworth Burch. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, I940. Pp. xi+287. $3.00. That a writer as notorious for his antiphilosophism as St. Bernard should have an "epistemology" of which a II 2-page discussion can present only a gen- eral outline is not surprising. For his opposition to "curiosity" and to the other sins which distract men from attention to their salvation has as its inverse side a long series of writings presenting an acute analysis of the way in which men may return to the truth from which their natural state and their pride mark a fall. The steps of humility, therefore, consisting in the twelve stages of the Bene- dictine Rule, are the first step of truth, whereby men come to know themselves by progressively acknowledging and hence checking their pride; the second and third steps of truth-love and contemplation-complete the process by yielding a knowledge of one's neighbors and finally a mystical vision of God. Bernard's</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 245 epistemology is hence also the statement of a way of life: knowledge is valuable only in so far as it leads to the highest good, but only through a life of methodic humility and love is such knowledge attainable. Burch has expounded this epistemology by means of a systematic synthesis of the many sermons, polemical tracts, and other writings in which its various fea- tures are presented. Since, as he recognizes, each of these works was "written at a particular time for a particular person or group" (p. I07), such a synthesis incurs the obvious danger that doctrines may be combined which are fully ex- plicable only in terms of their specific purpose, so that apparent contradictions may result. Thus, despite the fact that his introductory study consists largely in an elaborately ordered series of definitions, he finds it necessary to complain of "Bernard's inconsistency in terminology" (p. 25). However, the general homogeneity of Bernard's approach makes the book's method for the most part successful. The De gradibus humilitatis was previously translated by B. R. V. Mills (I929). Burch's version exhibits the handicaps of his aiming at an "imitation" of Bernard's style rather than at literalness (p. vi). A few examples must suffice. For Bernard's definition of humility, "Humilitas est virtus, qua homo verissima sui cognition sibi ipse vilescit," Burch has, "Humility is that thorough self-ex- amination which makes a man contemptible in his own sight" (pp. I24-25). Both the "virtue" and the "truest" have dropped out of the translation, which is especially unfortunate in that Bernard goes on at once to speak of ascending "from virtue to virtue," while the word "truth" occurs three more times in the same paragraph in a way in which its connection with the "truest" of the defini- tion is basic for full understanding of Bernard's meaning. Similarly, Burch translates Bernard's important term fructus indifferently by "goal," "reward," "end" (pp. I23, I33), while rendering considerate by "see" and sentiamus by "consider" (pp. I47, IVI). This repeated insensitivity to the demands of Ber- nard's Latin is all the more surprising in view of the care with which Burch has presented Bernard's precise definitions of these and other terms in his Introduc- tion. The Latin text, translation, and notes are followed by two appendixes-one on the metaphysics of the English Cistercian Isaac of Stella, the other on the fa- mous problem of Bernard's relation to Ab6lard. Burch attempts a solution of this problem by exhibiting Ab6lard as a continuator of Augustine and Bernard as a precursor of Thomas Aquinas. But surely this comparison should be strong- ly tempered by the fact that Bernard's distinction between faith and under- standing, each certain in its own sphere, is accompanied by a warning against curiosity concerning natural things, i.e., against that study which is concerned only with nature and not with its divine source, whose essence only faith capped by mystical contemplation can for the most part make known; and even more, perhaps, by the further fact that the objects of the understanding are for Ber- nard "invisible" things. Indeed, beyond the superficial similarities of their state- ments in which the same words appear, the elaborate context of definitions into</page><page sequence="3">246 ETHICS which Bernard's doctrine of the understanding is fitted makes it clear that only with the most painstaking qualifications can any valid comparison between him and Thomas on this or any other epistemological point be instituted. Despite these criticisms, however, Burch has produced a book for which stu- dents of medieval thought will be grateful. ALAN GEWIRTZ CHART FOR HAPPINESS. By Hornell Hart. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. Pp. xi+i98. $2.00. Professor Hart presents the euphorimeter, a scientific instrument for measur- ing happiness, as revolutionary in its field, according to the author's claims, as intelligence tests, fever thermometers, or the electrocardiograph in theirs. On the basis of the euphorimeter it is possible to discover, for example, that a young man falling in love is happy to the extent of nearly 400 euphor-units, 300 above the average, while another young man, whose mother is dying, gets a correspond- ing negative score. One can also discover that recently married couples are hap- pier than couples who have contemplated separation or divorce. Twenty-eight sorority girls, however, showed fluctuations in their scores from day to day (when tested, of course, by a trained expert); so it was necessary to devise an at-the-moment euphorimeter (as against the long-run euphorimeter) to test these fluctuations. Further, with a diagnostic euphorimeter, science shows us how to discover in which of several areas for instance, recreation, work, love- life, religion, our unhappiness lies. And finally, when these areas have been lo- cated, we may take the euphorimeter advice form and look up the corresponding remedies, accepting those which seem to apply exactly to our case and shelving the others. For instance, if your diagnostic euphorimeter score is negative in the area of love-life, you look up the advice sheet and decide whether to follow each of four imperatives: ". . . . to go to work systematically, with the best advice possible, to straighten out your love life"; ...... to take systematic measures to form more acquaintances with persons of the opposite sex; in company with these acquaintances do things that are fun and worth while but not sentimental (until the acquaintanceships deepen spontaneously into friendships)"; ". . .. to seek methods by which your marriage can be made joyful instead of painful"; ".... to consult an expert specialist on sex and marriage." The complete set of tests, with reporting and advice forms, can be secured for 25 cents (cash with order) from Professor Hornell Hart, Duke University, Durham, North Caro- lina. MARJORIE GRENE CATHOLIC PRINCIPLES OF POLITICS. By John A. Ryan and Francis J. Boland. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. Pp. 366. $3.00. A revised edition of The State of the Church, now published as a textbook for Catholic colleges. Church and state are said to cover separate and distinct zones of thought and action, each fulfilling its special function and having its peculiar</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 247 domain of jurisdiction. Temporal sovereignty exercised during long centuries in a part of Italy by Roman pontiffs does not extend as an international right. Even the most Catholic of nations has kept that frontier limited. In America, where a new social order has arisen, the church "willingly betakes itself to the folds of its own mantle" (Bishop Ireland). Catholicism looks upon states as having jurisdiction conferred providentially. The form of state governments may and will vary. Wherever the state functions, the church is concerned only with fundamentally moral and spiritual principles as they affect the rights of consciences and the inherent rights of individuals. The principle of the separation of the church and state is, however, not a uni- versal and absolute principle. Free people may choose what they will. The church is not inferior to civil powers. Its realm is exalted in its function to save souls. It may exert its influence by divine right upon the state in moral and spiritual matters. This influence will be a direct intervention only when there is a crisis; otherwise it will be indirect. Catholics are free in matters of political conscience; the church does not command votes. Past dogmas are not all quite in tune with the principles uttered in this book. Past dogmas, however, are not all on the same par. Catholic practice has not always been consistent with this affirmation. On the other hand, inconsistency is a vice not confined to one ecclesiastical body. VERGILIUS FERM NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF AUTHORITY. By Yves Simon. Milwaukee: Mar- quette University Press, 1940. PP. 78. An essay (Aquinas Lecture, 1940, at Marquette University) designed to show that between authority and liberty, rightly understood as to their true functions, there is no absolute antinomy. Wherever a common action of a community is required, the principle of noncoercive authority obtains; and yet the principle of liberty is not canceled but enhances the whole by the inherent nature of autono- mous individuals and small social units. VERGILIUS FERM THE STOIC AND EPICUREAN PHILOSOPHERS: THE COMPLETE EXTANT WRITINGS OF EPICURUS, EPICTETUS, LUCRETIUS, MARCUS AURELIUS. Edited and with an Introduction by Whitney J. Oates. New York: Random House, I 940. Pp. xxvi+627. $3.00. Cyril Bailey's translation of Epicurus, H. A. J. Munro's Lucretius, P. E. Matheson's Epictetus, and George Long's rendering of Marcus Aurelius are here included in a single volume. Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus and Matthew Arnold's Essay on Marcus Aurelius are appended, and Mr. Bailey's analyses of the letters of Epicurus are given in conjunction with his translations. The convenience of this edition for students limited to English texts needs no comment, for the vol- ume makes easily available at one comparatively reasonable price what would formerly have added up to a good deal of money. It seems a pity, however, that</page><page sequence="5">248 ETHICS the collection was not included at once in the "Modern Library Giant" series in- stead of in the higher-priced editions. Oates' Introduction leaves one with an uncomfortable feeling of vagueness with regard both to his interpretations of Greek philosophy and to the evidence on which they are assumed to rest. The sketch of earlier Greek philosophy is presented in terms of the most hackneyed philosophic weasel-words: of Plato's "dualism," "rationalism," "irrationalism"; Aristotle's "rationalism" and "monism," etc. And the tangle of "isms," obscure in itself, likewise obscures the connection Oates tries to establish between this general survey and the philosophers he is engaged in editing. One concludes that Oates has nothing he wants to say about Hellenistic philosophy but has con- trived to the satisfaction of the publishers to take up twenty-six pages saying it. MARJORIE GRENE THE SOCIAL GOSPEL RE-EXAMINED. By F. Ernest Johnson. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., I940. Pp. 26i. $2.00. This Rauschenbusch lecture re-examines the social gospel and reaffirms it. The book is largely a by-product of other books and articles. Topics which come in for consideration are theology, ethics, Christianity, war, democracy, human nature, and society. The best thing in the book, and that which gives the author a chance to cut loose from the ideas of others, is the section on war. Choosing the lesser of two evils, he says, is in itself a good; hence war may be a good and even compatible with a Christian conscience. Absolute principles are one thing; their applications are another. Life is not black or white; principles may be "either/or," but their implications are in terms of realistic compromise. VERGILIUS FERM LUCRETIUS: His GENIUS AND His MORAL PHILOSOPHY. By Schuyler Dean Hoslett. Kansas City: Midland Publishers, I939. PP. 46. This is a very slight little essay consisting mostly of little quotations from literary handbooks and from assorted poets-from Euripides through Fitz- gerald to Santayana. MARJORIE GRENE Is GOD EMERITUS? By Shailer Mathews. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. P. 93. $I.50. The answer to the title is "yes," wherever God is identified with outworn pat- terns of thought or transcendental orthodoxies, with unrealistic theological creeds or nonemotive philosophies. Substitute gods take the place of the emeri- tus God, e.g., gods of business, success, culture, nationalism, and the life. The other answer is "no," wherever the term God squares with the religious feeling compatible with the new scientific culture. Anthropomorphic conceptions are relative to culture; our age will employ anthropomorphic symbols but in terms of the cosmic process which is personality-producing. Like the hyperbola, cos-</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 249 mic activity is known only within the area of observation; how far it extends re- mains unknowable. The term God represents what we know as a cosmic tend- ency to produce personalities and the categories applicable to them-which also is real Christianity. This book goes far beyond the usual milk-and-water type of liberalism. Its liberalism, perhaps far ahead of the appreciation of contemporaries, is prophetic, I believe, of what is coming; moreover, its liberalism is not of the type that has lost its savor. VERGILIUS FERM CAN RELIGIOUS EDUCATION BE CHRISTIAN? By Harrison S. Elliott. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. Pp. 338. $2.50. Although a Ph.D. dissertation, this book is very well written. It is well in- formed in current theology, and pages are given over to an attack upon the present fad known as neo-orthodoxy. No one true interpretation of the Chris- tian religion, says the author, can form the basis of a philosophy of Christian education. Religious education is to mean an adaptation of historical experiences and convictions dating back to the historical founder in terms. of present-day meanings. It must always be experience centered in the largest meaning of that term. VERGILIUS FERM A FAITH To AFFIRM. By James Gordon Gilkey. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. Pp. I70. $I.75. Within American Protestantism there is an increasing number of people, especially college students and graduates, who, not being able to accept the re- ligious beliefs of the conservatives, are seeking a new and more liberal faith. The author, a Congregational minister of Springfield, Massachusetts, offers a gospel for such people which he frankly calls "new," since it is more than a modified version of pristine and historic Christianity. The book abounds in vital and reasonable insights driven home powerfully by concrete illustrations. The book affirms a faith which ought to seem most reasonable to honest doubters. VERGILIUS FERM CATHOLICISM AND THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE. By William M. Agar. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. Pp. I09. $I.00. The camel's nose is inside the tent in this book. The natural scientist looks in at Catholicism and finds himself welcome. Can Catholicism tolerate such an intrusion? "Yes" is the answer if Catholicism is rightly appraised and the nat- ural scientist philosophically sane. In this case the scientist is himself a Catholic, as well as well-informed. Catholicism, says the author, can well afford to wel- come the attested findings of naturalistic biology, geography, astronomy, geol- ogy, and the whole scientific temper both by reason of its Aristotelian heritage and by reason of the supernaturalistic character of its faith. The Catholic</page><page sequence="7">250 ETHICS church as a whole has not been antiscientific in its history, in spite of the con- trary claims of Protestant writers of history. Indeed, there are isolated cases of mistakes of councils and prelates. It was the masses who held back the church. When councils and bishops anathematized the scientists, they overstepped their prerogatives. Papal (and ecclesiastical) infallibility extends only to faith and morals and then only officially. This book offers an excellent example of high- type apologetics for Catholicism. One wonders, however, with so much of the camel inside, if historic criticism in the biblical field will not also stake its claims. VERGILIUS FERM BOETHIUS: SOME ASPECTS op His TIMES AND WORK. By Helen M. Barrett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I940. Pp. I79+Index. 7s. 6d. This is a study of the life of Boethius and of his last book, The Consolation of Philosophy. It is intended as an introduction to his work for those not familiar with the history of the sixth century. It is admirably done; and Miss Barrett is a good scholar who has read widely in reference to her subject. She seems, how- ever, to underestimate the political difficulties in which Theodoric found himself just before Boethius was arrested. He probably foresaw the policy of Justinian, which eventually undermined the kingdom of his successors. And there is no doubt that Boethius must have been at least friendly to any suggestion that the Roman Empire should be restored in Italy. The Consolation of Philosophy is very well summarized by Miss Barrett. Here, however, another criticism may be made. She continues the old controversy about the "Christianity" of Boethius, without giving any indication of what she means by "Christianity." Certainly Boethius, in The Consolation of Philosophy, depended upon Plato and not upon Paul. He makes no reference to Christ in his search for consolation; and although, like other educated men of his time, he may have been in some sense Christian, he certainly shows no interest in the theological doctrines of his day when he is discussing the sufferings of the just man and the comfort he may derive from reason. Boethius was in fact a rationalist; and it is because he pre- served, in his best book, a spark of that divine reason which he had derived from the Greeks that his work was of such value among the fears and superstitions of the Middle Ages.
