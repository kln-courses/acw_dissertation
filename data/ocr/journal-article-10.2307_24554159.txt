<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID STOREY: REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM by Susan Tollman Painters and sculptors who turn to prints can give numerous explanations for the move. More sociologically minded artists will point to the populist overtones and possibilities of prints—the breadth of their distribution, and their (supposedly) affordable price. More often, the reason provided is the lure of particular visual effects: the rich blacks of etching, the porousness of a lithographic stain, the brutal force of woodcut strokes, and so on. It's the kind of dull, tactile reason artists often provide in place of what we really want to know: how did ideas come to be embedded in these particular objects? David Storey made his first print (not counting art school efforts some decades back) in 1984, and the reason he gives is typi cal: "I was trying to get a surface in drawing that was really about the kind of volumetric surfaces you get in etching." In other words, it was a technical experiment in pursuit of texture, a tangent followed out of frustration with the the superficial properties of another medium. There is nothing in this explana tion about ideas, or about inspiration, or about the more edifying attributes of what constitutes art. It might be a banal remark to cover true inspiration, or it might be a dead pan acknowledgement of a deadpan formal ism. But, although Storey's art is abstract, one glance makes it clear that pure formal ism is not its guiding force. Neither is alle gory of the Peter Halley prison-cell-conduit variety. In fact, at a time when most abstract art falls into one camp or the other, Storey is something of an anomaly. While historically involved (as all but the most naive abstract art must be) with the great bugbear of Modernism, his imagery recollects not Modernism's unassailable greatness or heroics, but rather its degraded, popular, North Beach Bohemian para phrase. He is fond of fat, asymmetrical tear drop shapes, of awkward ellipses and imperfect arches that taper to uneven toes, of forms at once self-consciously graceless and cartoonishly avant-garde. The colors of his paintings tend toward the vegetable tones of David Storey, Series III, Proof II, monotype (37x23-1/2 in.), 1987. Derrière L'Etoile Studios, early '60s upholstery fabric (pumpkin, avo cado, tomato)—the kind of colors one is inclined to attribute to the aging of chemical dyes.
