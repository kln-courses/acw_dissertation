<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Serra Taking the measure of the impossible STEPHEN MELVILLE 1. In 1992 Richard Serra placed two nearly identical forged steel blocks in theTate's Duveen Galleries. Their exact dimensions and placement were determined by a variety of calculations derived from both the given architectural situation and a presumed average viewer. In speaking of what he wanted from this piece, Serra makes apparently casual use of the word "absolute," in ways that I take to be of some interest?so I'm going to spend quite a bit of time poking at this with a view to eventually producing a reading of it in the larger context of Serra's work over all and, more particularly, that of what I take to be a significant turn in his work, one that is well under way by the time of his Weight and Measure at the T?te. I'll start with this comment, which comes in response to a question asking Serra to relate that work to one recently shown in Switzerland: "The work for the T?te is more absolute. It only functions as it focuses the experience on its particular architectural context. The Hours of the Day was not as exacting in relation to the surrounding architecture, which is comparatively neutral."1 This word "absolute" appears new to Serra's talk about his sculpture, but it's also a word that will seem not terribly surprising in the general context of his work from the early 1970s on. It fits, for example, well enough with a widespread general sense of Serra's personal and sculptural intransigence. But it seems also a usefully precise way of speaking of at least two readily visible aspects of that work?his marked tendency to develop his pieces in such a way as to make an explicit issue of the viewer or the viewer's experience, and, clearly closely related, his strong interpretation of site specificity such that the piece cannot maintain its integrity apart from its situation. The first of these is clearly a strategic matter?if one can instance a number of pieces in which crucial dimensions of the work are determined with reference to such "objective" systems as those provided by a particular architecture or such larger geophysical coordinate systems as those given by cardinal directions, sea-level based topographical measurements, and so on (as, for example, in Lemgo Vectors, 1998), one can also instance a number of works in which the key dimensions are determined by systems of subjective measure?for example, the shaping of Shift (1973) by the lines along which two observers can hold one another in view while moving across the landscape.2 Both of these strategies would appear to aim at the same end, which is most usually phrased in terms of bringing the viewer's embodiment directly into the experience of the piece either by letting that body discover its internal relation to the piece or by holding that body explicitly outside the terms of its composition; and both strategies work equally to defeat the kind of direct, tacit, and idealized self-recognition that Serra presumably takes to be at the heart of a problematic anthropomorphism deeply embedded in the sculptural tradition. It's notable here that "absolute" means by contrast with the relative and contingent and is evidently invoked precisely in order to free up that force. The second sense in which Serra's work generally might seem to invite an imagination of its absoluteness is rather different. It draws on the way in which the work is exactly and entirely what it is where it is?how it can be neither substituted for nor displaced elsewhere. The battle over Tilted Arc (1981) was ultimately a fight over the work's identity and the absoluteness of that identity. This invocation of absoluteness would be for its own sake: it describes the work less in terms of a freeing up of the relative and contingent than it does in terms of how it grants or perhaps imposes on its situation a new condition: the particular plaza or meadow or hillside in which the work is made does not cease to be the particular and contingent thing it has always been but, 1.

"The work," Serra writes in relation to Shift (1973), "establishes a measure" (W/:12). Different as this sense is from the first, it extends and deepens one's sense of Serra's overall project of making the sculptural and monumental an access to, a way of grasping, the contingent as such. In general, Serra's ways of talking about his work don't easily produce words like "absolute"?words that attempt some sort of general characterization of how his pieces appear, what general kind of presence they have. His distinct tendency is to give very close descriptions of both the material involved and the specific decisions made?so, for example, with Weight and Measure we get remarks about the choice of forged steel, about the particular shape arrived at, and its highly particular dimensions. Each of these is taken up very firmly in the context of a particular effect?"holding a sculptural volume"?that is Serra's clear goal for the piece. Serra's account of how Weight and Measure came to be two forged units, both 9 feet wide and 41 inches deep, one 60 inches high and the other 68 inches, placed at either end of the gallery, is an account of what he takes to be necessary to make a sculpture there, and this, typically, is what Serra is most interested in saying about this work. By contrast, the word "absolute" belongs to a rather different level of descriptive concern, on the face of it less empirically bound to the work and closer to other terms through which we try to characterize the general look or feel of a piece. In postwar American art, this is the field in which the word "abstract" figured prominently and rather obscurely?this is a word that has always mattered and been explicitly available to Serra in speaking of his work?and it is also the field in which such words as "specific" and "concrete" came to occupy central positions. Both of these words play crucial roles in a history of artistic and critical translation to which Serra very much belongs. Here one would want roughly to say that "specificity," first deployed within formalist criticism as a term taken to Richard Serra, Weight and Measure, 1992. Forged weatherproof steel.

It was of course a condition of this shift that the field in which it made sense was no longer obviously that of painting, which was at least seen to have pretty much fallen, root and branch, into the abstract. Serra tends not to use the word "specific" except in such formations as "site specific," and he is, unlike a number of artists of his generation, actively uninterested in taking up the term "concrete."3 It's tempting, then, to say that this word "absolute" comes to take up a particular place in Serra's ability to describe his work, although it would be important also to say that there's no reason to imagine that this place existed as some sort of lacuna until Serra found the word to fill it. It is, presumably, not only a new piece of vocabulary but also a mark of a kind of extension in his descriptive grammar. I will come back to this thought, but it may be worth noticing that even in this brief sketch the word "abstract" has slid from naming a kind of painting or sculpture (or perhaps the kind of thing rendered by such painting or sculpture) toward naming something rather broader and different? a certain failure of the work to be itself or to be itself in the right way. This evidently happens when the "specificity" invoked as a partial justification for abstraction within one or another medium becomes something like a medium-name of its own; Serra's continued use of the word "abstract" in its initial sense might then seem to signal a certain continuing attachment to a particular grammar across a moment of its apparent devastation.4 For the present, though, I want to continue to poke at the outer edges of this word "absolute," because there's another system it plausibly figures in as well, the system of words through which we try to phrase how art stands out in or perhaps apart from the world. Given the deep role of site-specificity in Serra's work, these are terms one can expect to be of some importance to him. It's in this region that one can find him saying things like, "Site-specific works emphasize the comparison between two separate languages, their own and that of their surroundings, unlike modernist works which give the illusion of being autonomous from their surroundings, functioning critically only in relation to their own tradition."5 This remark is both clear enough and fairly difficult. Tilted Arc is certainly a good practical example of what it means, and the appeal here to language is very useful in thinking about Tilted Arc as public sculpture?about the way in which it amounts to an assertion of a certain incommensurability and non communication at the very heart of the public space, and does so over and against the commissioner's expectation that it should somehow show and speak for the unity and sharability of that space. "I am not," he says in 1980 as Tilted Arc is under way, "interested in sculpture that conventionalizes metaphors of content or assimilates architectonic spiritual subjects, for there is no socially shared metaphysic"(W/:100). The rhetoric of those ultimately responsible for its destruction is clearly excessive and over-determined, but it's accurate enough in picking up on the way in which Tilted Arc ends up asserting isolation and privacy as the effective truth of the space it articulates, thus offering no shared language for or gathering of a community of other than isolated individuals, which is, of course, no community at all. What's also clear enough in Serra's remark is the distance it intends taking from well-known formalist claims and readings, particularly the Greenbergian notion of medium-specific autonomy arrived at through a process of ongoing "Kantian" self-criticism and aimed at a condition most frequently characterized, often in hesitant quotation marks, as "purity." In terms of the immediate past of sculpture, this is the tradition of, above all, David Smith and Anthony Caro, a body of work from which Serra is always at pains to distance 3. See, for example, his exchange with Peter Eisenman, in Wl, pp. 150-151. 4. The more general uncertainty in the 1960s and early 70s about just how issues of "abstraction" and issues of "medium" relate to one another?as well as the centrality of this uncertainty?is interestingly evident in Amy Newman's recent book on Artforum, Challenging Art: Artforum 1962-1974 (New York: SoHo Press, 2000). 5. Richard Serra, "Introduction," in Clara Weyergraf and Martha Buskirk, eds., The Destruction of Tilted Arc: Documents (Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 1991), p. 12. In Wl, p. 203, this passage appears in a modified form (that, as Foster notes, Serra uses throughout that collection): "Site-specific works primarily engender a dialogue with their surroundings. Every language has a structure about which one can say nothing critical in that language. There must be another language, dealing with the structure of the first but possessing a new structure to criticize the first." The drift of this revision is toward recognizing the relation between languages as linked to internal relations constitutive of a language.</page><page sequence="4">188 RES 46 AUTUMN 2004 himself (he prefers to locate himself, as sculptor, in relation to Brancusi and, as no-longer-painter, interestingly, in relation to Velasquez). What remains difficult in the remark is the actual weight and force of the distinction between "autonomy"?clearly a bad word?and what Serra is claiming for his own work, which does, after all, still sound an awful lot like "autonomy."6 In suggesting that the word "absolute" has a place in this field as well, I am asking that one hear something of the sense of a passage from Kant to Hegel?from a notion or image of autonomy that finds its most readily available gloss in "purity" toward whatever difference it is that "absoluteness" marks?going on in Serra's work and so also in his reflections on it. 7 This, of course, can't amount to a serious claim apart from some fuller engagement with Serra's work and particularly with whatever in it might be held to produce, in or around 1992, the word "absolute" in roughly the dimensions I've sketched. There are several ways on from this point, but probably the fairest is to note that I've so far cited only one of two uses of the word "absolute" in the interview with Serota and Sylvester. The other use seems quite different; indeed, almost exactly opposed to the one I've been exploring. Serra says, "I dismissed the idea of using cubes as quickly as I dismissed the idea of using octagons and for the same reason. They would have been read as objects in the galleries. I've only forged one large cube. It is very absolute to forge a cube" (W/:275). This remark refers to an earlier comment: "To work with octagons was on my mind. And for a while I thought I would use them, but the active shape of the octagon draws too much attention to itself. It is too busy for this space. It can be too easily read as an interesting object" (WI-.27A). There's a lot, I think, to be said about this. I'll start with the simplest point?that it underlines how far the word "absolute" emerges less as a distinct meaning, than as the mark of a grammar of sorts. Perhaps the next thing to notice is the particular threat Serra sees in the rejected shapes?that they would constitute "interesting objects." For all of Serra's overt opposition to the critical tradition of Greenberg and Fried, and for all his desire to distance himself from the sculptural work they championed, this does of course quite literally repeat Fried's critique of the minimalist specific object?that it is merely interesting?and so one may suspect that Serra also shares in some sense in Fried's overarching Kantian criterion of disinterest.8 Without exactly settling this last question, it is certainly worth noting that over the course of the interview Serra effectively repeats a number of key points in the formalist critique of minimalism. When asked about lighting for the completed piece, he rejects any specific lighting as "theatrical," and toward the end of the interview he offers a sustained comment on the problematic dependence of minimalist work on its gallery context: I would say that minimalism is based on the theology of reduction. One of the biggest limitations of minimalism, ironically, is its relation to context. The work was originally made in and for a loft space, which was then imitated by the galleries of the 1970s and 80s. . . . Now the container and contained can both go into circulation. The minimalists' notion of site specificity was always limited to the room, the perfect white cube. That explains why any attempt to place minimalist sculptures in the landscape or urban sites reduces them ... to homeless objects (W/:278).9 It's hardly surprising that it is a cube that should show up here with the force of the unacceptable absolute set against the more desirable absoluteness of the T?te piece. Once again oddly miming the formalism he otherwise opposes, Serra tells Bernard Lamarche-Vadel: "The work I make does not allow for experience outside the conventions of sculpture as sculpture" (Wl\\ 17). Serra entered into the making of sculpture at a moment when its possibility appeared significantly blocked just because the space in which sculpture might be made was both occupied and transformed in advance by the minimalist object, paradigmatically a certain kind of not simply empty but distinctively hollow cube through which various desires or interests more or less endlessly looped without coming to any resolution or resting point in what is finally, and multiply, neither the expression of 6. One might note in this respect Serra's concern, from early on (it's a large part of what he values in Brancusi), for the sculptural question of the base as a question of autonomy, of support and self support. 7. And in thinking about this, one should certainly be willing to hear in "absoluteness" a certain avoidance?so also echo?of "absolution." 8. "Judd himself has as much as acknowledged the problematic character of the literalist enterprise by his claim, 'A work needs only to be interesting.' For Judd, as for literalist sensibility generally, all that matters is whether or not a given work is able to elicit and sustain [his] interest. Whereas within the modernist arts nothing short of conviction . . . matters at all." Michael Fried, Art and Objecthood (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 164-165. 9.

The standard narrative about this work places a particular premium on the ways in which it emerges out of a crisis not in sculpture but in painting?what Serra calls "the theology of reduction"?in which painting discovers that its "irreducible essence" arises from its being an object in a situation and not from any of the conventions that seemed merely to confine it to the wall, to two dimensionality, and so on. This genealogy is surely right if one is to understand how, for example, minimalism finds itself committed to hollowness, as a radical reworking of the finitude of painting understood as the means of its essential concealment or self-hiding (the face of the minimalist cube thus appearing as a barrier to an interiority that has no sense or meaning apart from its staged inaccessibility). But whatever its origin, one effect of the minimalist object is that it clearly intervenes powerfully in the field of modernist sculpture, putting an effective end to a particular thought at work in David Smith and Anthony Caro, which is of sculpture as the vehicle of exteriority as such and wholly apart from?that is, void of any reference to?any interiority contained by or expressed by that exteriority. In different ways, both these artists were making work that is all "outside."10 Minimalism can seem to continue and radicalize this work?when Robert Morris places four mirrored cubes on the gallery floor so that there is nothing effectively to be seen except the gallery floor, walls, and ceiling now registered on or as their surfaces, we may seem to have advanced still further into this sculpture's passage into its own exteriority. But of course this is mostly not how we actually read the silent man in the mirrored sunglasses; we recognize him as withdrawn behind them and do not take the images that flicker on his shades as his expression but as his camouflage, his refusal of expression or its visibility. And if you start taking the world of mirror-shades as in fact the actual world of human beings, it will be hard not to suspect that even those not withdrawn behind them might nonetheless be androids or otherwise in disguise. When Serra begins trying to make sculpture, he finds himself at grips with a medium whose capacities for expression have been vitiated by an objecthood already installed in its space and that will divide any work entered into it between an inaccessible interior and an externality it cannot successfully claim as its own. Serra's first move in this context seems clear enough: given the apparent blocking of the prospects of the sculptural object, his thought is to replace it with an action?certainly much of his early work falls out well enough under this description (the list of verbs, the film of a hand trying to catch lead bricks dropping vertically through the frame, the lead castings, the prop pieces). And surely One Ton Prop (House of Cards) (1969) is rightly seen as a key piece: At once object and action, it reworks the minimalist cube into something for which neither interiority nor exteriority are given but in which both are engendered in the work's sustaining? supporting?of itself; gravity, what binds it to the floor and by which it is continuously threatened, is at the same time what allows it to be self-supporting, its base or basedness as much a consequence of as a condition for its internal support (and in this way then very different from Morris's apparently similar Untitled (Corner Piece) (1964)?a prime instance of minimalist site-specificity that becomes site-specific by taking the gallery as both base and support, accounting for the whole of its condition). But from here things rapidly broaden into a range of work each element of which would need its own proper attention. It seems at least useful to distinguish three broad ranges of work: (1) gallery pieces, which in their strong form, like Strike (1969-1971), are repeated attempts to find ways in which sculpture can recover its own exteriority without falling into?either in itself or contextually?its architectural container, and in their weaker form continue to explore the grammar of sculptural action; (2) urban pieces, like Sight Point (1971-1975) that largely continue One Ton Prop's exploration of sculpture's open interiority; and (3) landscape pieces, like Shift (1973), that explore a sculptural laterality free of the risk of a pictoriality Serra fears comes with the framing situations of the gallery or urban context.11 In saying that these three threads form a practice, I mean that they enable an ongoing 10. How far this is the sculptural equivalent to what Greenberg and Fried see animating modernist painting?another distinct instance of the self-seeking of the medium?and how far it is an instance of a minor medium reshaping itself under the influence of a major one? sculpture remaking itself in the image of, under the constraints of, painting?is a question that visibly troubles the writing of both Greenberg and Fried and that is, I think, powerfully continued and transformed in Serra's work. 11. Foster suggests a closely related division of Serra's work?"This provisional definition suggests a partial typology of the work: landscape markings, urban framings, and gallery interventions"?and further suggests, as I will also, that any such typology is complicated by movements of both repetition and expansion. "This is," he writes, "what it is to develop a sculptural language."

Several general features worth noticing cut across this work?the first is its general orientation to something like the plane and so also its continuing openness to?and worry about?a certain pictoriality.12 A second is the emergence of a distinct interest in geometry, not always readily apparent at first glance: Sight Point may look like a relatively ad hoc propping of its members against one another, but from the inside it becomes clear that this propping is in fact oriented to a particular and regular geometrical transformation passing between its ground plane and the frame opened on the sky at its top. Such geometrical transformation is a regular feature of Serra's vertical work in particular.13 Both of these general features, the planarity and the geometrical orientation, are underlined by Serra's shift away from the malleability, density, and palpable materiality of the early lead pieces to the sharper edges, greater rigidity, and more purely external surface of the Cor-Ten steel he comes to work in almost exclusively. What binds all this work together is a shared reliance on active relation as the ultimate stuff of which the work is made as well as its across-the-board participation in what one can still reasonably think of as an essentially Kantian imagination of art, particularly insofar as it is a body of work in which art evidently aspires to something like the condition of nature. Serra's version of this obviously tends toward the sublime?the nature in question would be overpowering and confrontational? and like Kant's analysis of the sublime it rubs up against places where the fact of raw and unassimilable nature begins to turn toward some other fact or range of facts that have crucially to do with history and metaphor and the strange power or capacity called "originality." The result is a body of work of extraordinary strength and real achievement that is wholly definitive for any effort to think about contemporary sculpture. But it's also a failure. The simplest way to put this is to say that it pours all its energy into refusing to let itself be assimilated to either painting or architecture without ever actually establishing itself as sculpture; it is that only by default, by the indirect measure of its resistance to what it is not. But this way of putting it is, in the end, a bit too simple?it's more accurate to say that there's something about how it is sculpture that it has not quite taken on board, and that it cannot take on board without significantly changing its form. Serra is certainly right at every legal level about the outrage that was the destruction of Tilted Arc, but I can't help feeling that he also knew, even before the battle was joined, that Tilted Arc was the visible proof of what his sculpture could not yet be?to wit, actively public and sharable. This was a test he had held himself apart from throughout the 1970s by virtue of a relatively flimsy argument about the need, for the work's autonomy, to hold itself apart from ideologically overdetermined spaces?thus his preference for specifically marginal urban sites, waste spaces of various kinds. I call the argument flimsy because it depends, as Serra phrases it, on both embracing the common thought that "everything is ideological" and finding a way to flee from or discount it. If the argument is, at least as I've put it, flimsy, the underlying social or political intuition?say, that what is currently on offer as publicness, shareability, community, and the like amounts to an intolerable and unsustainable charade? may well seem both accurate and urgent, thus reason enough to avoid spaces dedicated to its perpetuation or celebration. But holding too tightly to this fact will eventually amount to surrendering one's claim to sculpture, to its essential publicness: sculpture's job is not to refuse ?ts own publicness nor to undo its shareability but to invent or reinvent them. Tilted Arc does not do this. But it states the problem in its fullest extremity: that we cannot say "we," that there is nothing we share. I take Serra's next major public piece, Clara-Clara, put up in the Tuileries in 1983 and now installed at La Defense, to be his best and most critical reading of Tilted Arc. Tilted Arc was essentially a slice or peel off the surface of a cylinder, tilted by the angle at which the larger cylinder might be imagined placed into the earth, just as the slightly earlier and distinctly less controversial St. Johns Rotary Arc (1980) was made from a cylindrical section placed off-center within its context. Clara-Clara is different in at least two respects: it is a double arc, the two sections placed like parentheses turned back to back, and the sections in question are peels from a 12. This concern is one evidence of Serra's continuing engagement with issues that ultimately derive from David Smith and Anthony Caro. 13. On this, Yve-Alain Bois's remarks on the separation, even opposition, of plan and elevation in Serra's work are particularly worth noting.

These two differences are intimately related in that they both push forms of dividedness or eccentricity into the sculpture itself rather than asking the sculpture to be the marker of a dividedness or divisiveness external to it. In the years since Serra has frequently remarked that something new starts here. It takes him, I think, more than a decade to really consolidate what Clara-Clara starts, and "consolidation" takes, as always, the form of a ramifying work of articulation. The lines along which the work develops are once again three-fold?there's a line that explores linear doubling (e.g., Serpentine, 1993), a line oriented to conical geometries (Torqued Ellipse, 1996), and there's a particular line of return to, repetition of, earlier work. This last line is closely bound to a notable material shift in Serra's practice with the emergence of a significant body of forged work. The first two of these lines more or less continuously inform one another?the segments composed in works like Running Arcs (1992, the earliest, I think, in this series) are conic sections, and the Torqued Ellipses find their core form in the eccentric vertical doubling of a geometrical form itself defined by its double center. It's unsurprising that the Torqued Ellipses unfold more or less immediately into Double Torqued Ellipse. My last line?combining a certain tendency toward repetition and a turn toward the new technology of forging?obviously has its own inner complexity: On the one hand, Serra makes or remakes a number of early works, often assigning them uniquely double dates, and, on the other, he begins working quite broadly with forged steel. The forged steel props of the late 1980s and the 1990s are, in effect, the seam along which these two tendencies are bound together. The forged block and rounds that also begin to show up both in gallery pieces like Weight and Measure and in landscape pieces like the Lemgo Vectors (1998) are, I think, best seen as repetitions of the early and notorious Skullcracker series (1969) in which, in a California junkyard, Serra stacked</page><page sequence="9">Melville: Richard Serra 193 steel slabs on top of one another. Forging is, in effect, such stacking and compacting made internal to the single block or round?a way, then, of carrying into the work the action Serra had taken up in order to insulate his sculpture against its reduction to objecthood, and so also a way of making the relations through which his work sustained itself?as in One Ton Prop?palpable as the very stuff of the work itself.14 And this is, of course, one way of saying what I want to say about this later work across the board: it uses repetition and doubling?temporal, geometrical, and material?as a way of carrying relation more deeply into the heart of the work so that the terms of its containment and self-containment become continuous with its capacity to pass beyond itself. This is a further version or transformation of the relation between exteriority and interiority at work in One Ton Prop, and one that extends the underlying impulse to render no interior that does not also count as a form of exteriority or exposure. The sculpture thus does not simply make itself stand out against its context (Tilted Arc did that well enough) but makes that context its own in a new way: Serra no longer allows himself the luxury of imagining that the work and its surroundings speak separate and incommensurable languages, not because he has come to believe in some kind of common measure between languages but because he has come to a new recognition of incommensurability as a fact of language as such (but of course this will also mean that "incommensurablity" no longer exactly means what it had seemed to mean and no longer carries the same consequences, or at least not in the same way). All this is I find hard to say well. That repetition plays a key role here compounds the difficulty?it is, of course, what was at work in my hesitating over whether it was more right to say of the earlier work that it was not yet sculpture (as if it were missing something) or that there was something about how it was sculpture that it had not yet taken aboard (there was, in a sense, nothing missing, at least not that way). In 1993 Serra repeated, more or less, Tilted Arc as a piece called Gravity, made for the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. As a Serra piece it's not particularly surprising?a steel slab that enters its site?a broad stairway?by dividing it, and thus being a certain kind of obstacle in it. On a facing wall as one descends there's a text from the book of Isaiah that one reads in part as belonging to, spoken by, the sculpture, although it is also obviously and more importantly spoken of and by the events that the museum aims to sustain in visibility: "You are my witnesses." It is, as a purely sculptural matter, a text one might imagine equally spoken by Tilted Arc. But of course were Tilted Arc to have said this, it would have done so not simply to each of us but radically in the singular, the only person it recognized, and it would have managed to say this through or as the resistance it posed to that individual, through the sheer intransigence of its presence.15 Gravity draws on something like that intransigence but it is closer now to the intransigence of fact than of, say, will or determination. How it manages this is another thing I find difficult to say?it's certainly in part a matter of scale, and of all the decisions that Serra so determinedly works over in describing his pieces: how its dimensions end up being those of a slab?not, say, a block that might count as a tomb and equally not a slice that would merely divide. It's thick enough to make the difference that is a condition of our witness, not simply of it but of how we find ourselves in this particular museum dedicated to a loss of humans and humanity and that thus asks of us particularly complex acknowledgments of what we are, what we can and cannot be, to one another, how we can and cannot find terms for the sharing and sharing out of the human.16 14. "Using a forged element results in the density of mass and weight being contained within the form. Forging is the most compacted way of shaping steel; more molecules are pressed into the same space than in casting. I have a reluctance to cast in steel or iron because the perforation that occurs in the surface of the cast during the cooling process gives the material a soft and porous look." Richard Serra, Sculpture, 1985-1998, p. 71. 15. But of course it's also right and necessary to say here that there is a strict limit on any imagination of Tilted Arc "saying" this at all, just because a part of what it does is hold itself radically apart from language altogether; Gravity's ability to stand in the light of, and in some sense assume responsibility for, a specifically textual situation is one of its differences from Tilted Arc. 16. "Rartage," the French would read here, as if Jean-Luc Nancy were writing of Serra, rather than Bataille: "That is to say he gave up thinking the sharing of community and the sovereignty in the sharing or shared sovereignty, share between Daseins, between singular existences that are not subjects, and whose relation?the sharing itself?is not a communion, nor the appropriation of an object, nor a self-recognition, nor even a communication as this is understood to exist between subjects. But these singular beings are themselves constituted by sharing, they are distributed and placed, or rather spaced, by the sharing that makes them others: other for one another, and other, infinitely other, for the Subject of their fusion, which is engulfed in the sharing, in the ecstasy of the sharing: "communicating" by not "communing." These "places of communication" are no longer places of fusion, even though in them one passes from one to the other; they are defined and exposed by their dislocation. Thus, the communication of sharing would be this very dislocation." Jean-Luc Nancy, The Inoperative Community, trans. P. Connor and C. Fynsk</page><page sequence="10">194 RES 46 AUTUMN 2004 There is one detail that has, I think, a particular role in all this?the slight tilting of the slab that makes it bite into the steps in which it is set (Serra speaks of how it "impales" the landing).17 In its simultaneous contingency and its precision (exactness and exactingness?say, necessity), it is as good an instance as any of what Serra might mean by "absolute," and the piece as a whole is my best example of the difficult line between what is not missing and what is yet to be taken on board, the complex play of repetition and acknowledgment out of which Serra's late work arises.18 2. I've said that Serra finds himself at the beginning of his career faced both with a particular complex of critical claims about autonomy and medium-specificity, claims that come wrapped in a host of references to Kant, and a very particular question about the possibility of sculpture in the wake of minimalism. It certainly seems right to see his early work unfolding within a version of that Kantian context?Serra aiming at a certain kind of sublimity that would give his art something like the force of nature, with his orientation to sculpture as action rather than object inflecting this toward Kant's "dynamic sublime." If I've focused on the appearance of the word "absolute" as an element in the description of both the risks and goals of his recent work, it is because (no doubt not very surprisingly) I think the place he has wound up is importantly Hegelian, and so also that his use of this word can in fact bear the weight of such a reading.19 One might begin from the thought that for Hegel, within that stretch of the history of thought that amounts to art's history, classical sculpture is the moment of art's closest approximation to the Absolute. One thing this means is that classical sculpture occupies, within the system of cycles and epicycles that are the track of Hegel's dialectic, the same position, at "a lower level," as the Absolute (sculpture dialectically prefigures the Absolute or, conversely, is what is recovered by the Absolute at a "higher level"). And this must also mean that the sculptor thinks in matter what the philosopher thinks in thought, or that the sculptor makes in matter what the philosopher makes in thought, the ambivalence of this formulation reflecting the way Hegelian argument and Greek sculpture share a certain fundamental "plasticity."20 And this gets usefully thicker if one goes on to draw out the relation between Hegel's description of sculpture's achievement and descriptions he offers of his own achievement?as, for example, in remarks to the effect that in sculpture "each part is there independently and in its own particular character, while, all the same, owing to the fullest richness of the transitions, it remains in firm connection not only with its immediate neighbour but with the whole. Consequently the shape is perfectly animated at every point; even the minutest detail has ?ts purpose; everything has its own particular character, its own difference, its own distinguishing mark, and yet it remains in continual flux and lives only in the whole."21 The appeal here to "continual flux" that finds its life "only in the whole" is, as it is also in Hegel's description of his own achievement, continuous with a claim to "independence" and "self-repose." Somewhat less on the surface is the deep rhyme between classical sculpture's "perfect plasticity"?that is, its particular realization of "substantial individuality" as something wholly given in exteriority and utterly apart from any hint of a subjective interiority that would either find expression in the sculpture or remain as if reserved or withheld within it?and Hegel's repeated descriptions of his system as having its center everywhere and circumference nowhere, as, that is, essentially (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991), p. 25. A part of what one wants to hear in this passage is not simply the movement within "partage" from "sharing" to "sharing out, apportioning" but also the movement from "partage"?say "parting"?to "passage." 17. Richard Serra, Sculpture 1985-1998 (Los Angeles: The Museum of Contemporary Art, 1999), p. 127. 18. Just here one may find one's self wanting to say a great deal more, about, for example, how Gravity might awaken echoes of Mallarm?'s "calme bloc ici-bas d?chu d'un d?sastre obscur"and of Blanchot's way of making that thought of poetry also a thought of the Holocaust and of how these things are threaded also through the thought that "un coup de d?s jamais n'abolira le hasard." If one feels, as I do, this order of readerly and sculptural intelligence to Gravity, then it will also be striking how Gravity can appear as a reading of these texts?revising both their shapes as, say, pages and the shapes they imagine for themselves?the tomb, the die, the architecture that always subtends Blanchot's voices and fragments?into its own. 19. Bois's "Picturesque Stroll . . ." takes up the sublime in a particularly interesting way precisely on the occasion of Clara-Clara, which I have more nearly taken as marking Serra's passage beyond Kantian concerns. 20. As, for example, in the Phenomenolog/s remark that "only a philosophical exposition that rigidly excludes the usual way of relating the parts of a proposition could achieve the goal of plasticity."

"expository," wholly given in and as its exposition.22 Sculpture and the Absolute are thus both sites or occasions for a people's full, mutual self-recognition (cultural in the once case, and human in the other). One might remark, finally, that both sculpture, in its privileged moment, and the Absolute may appear to lay claim to a certain "totalizing" force; in particular, classical sculpture takes itself as radically central, the other arts?architecture most especially?amounting to no more than moments of ?ts continuing outward expression. It's notable that this perfect sculptural plasticity also looks like the moment, at the heart of Hegel's aesthetics, where something very like Kant's notion of beauty suddenly makes ?ts force felt. One might put this in terms of classical sculpture's immunity to interest?its realization in each case as pure individuality and as individuality wholly unfolded into its appearing. While Hegel's general criterion for artistic achievement is the adequation of form and content, the meaning of such adequation varies with the content: Architectural form is adequate to its content by containing it, while painterly form is adequate to ?ts content in and as its acknowledgment of what it cannot perfectly express nor even contain; only in sculpture does adequacy take the form of content's disappearance as such?"formalism" is its proper end (one might also more simply note that explicitly Kantian criteria make their only, 22. Hegel's extraordinary emphasis on sculpture's exteriority?on what it is for it to be a center rather than have one?comes out with particular clarity in his well-known discussion of the eye in Greek sculpture: "The work of sculpture has no inwardness which would manifest itself explicitly as this ?deal glance," Aesthetics, p. 732. This claim gains renewed interest as one tries to think through the situation of sculpture between the hollowness of objecthood and the problematic "pictoriality" often attributed to Smith and Caro. It should also be noted that, whatever the inadequacies of Hegel's grasp of the facts of Greek sculpture, his understanding of the contrast between being a center and having one in relation to imaginations of "the glance," or as we now often say "the gaze," remains compelling, and indeed opens a powerful line of reflection on the implication of minimalism, for all ?ts abstraction, in a particular logic of the gaze.</page><page sequence="12">196 RES 46 AUTUMN 2004 unacknowledged, appearance in Hegel's discussion of classical sculpture as "beauty at once free and necessary."23 Sculpture is thus a crucial hinge between Kant's aesthetics and Hegel's, but it is by the same token also a crucial hinge between Kant's aesthetics and the shape of Hegel's philosophy as a whole. This is a particular way of underlining the well-known centrality of Kant's Critique of Judgment to Hegel's reading of and overall response to Kant. As Heidegger puts it in his 1936 lecture course on Schelling, "The will to the system is consciously supported and guided by a dispute with Kant's work and above all with his last work, the Critique of Judgment (and that means: by a unique admiration for Kant)."24 Heidegger's gloss on this "will to the system" is also very much to the present question: "For the development of the demand of a system urges precisely toward understanding system less and less only as the framework of knowledge of beings and more and more as the jointure of Being itself, and toward shaping it accordingly."25 The opposition Heidegger puts here between "framework" and some other shaping more fully answerable to "the jointure of Being itself," is a phrasing of the opposition between Kantian architectonic and Hegelian system, and it is a phrasing that makes particularly palpable the further translation of that opposition into one between the "inner jointure" of sculpture and the mere framework of architecture. It may be tempting then to say that within the rhetoric of the Critique of Judgment the slippage from images of architectural foundation toward figures of bridge and keystone, with the latter's special emphasis on a stability that is not provided in advance but is the ongoing fact of an edifice's support, is an index of the way in which "the battle for the system" (as Heidegger puts it) is not so much a battle to be waged (by Hegel or Schelling, among others) against that text as it is a battle already engaged within it. But it will also not be clear how this tension within a certain architectural imagination is to be related to the tension between sculpture and architecture altogether, thus not fully clear how the battle within Kant and the battle against him are finally the same or different. Two things should be clear at this point. The first is that Richard Serra's work is not, in Hegel's terms, classical sculpture. The second is that Hegel's terms do name, and name in their essential interconnection, the central stakes and processes of Serra's work: its refusal of interiority, its insistence on the terms of its publicness, the recognitions it can and cannot engender, its concern for the means and situations of its support, and its intimacy with the architectural. One may be tempted then to say that Serra's work appears within the horizon of a classical from which it nonetheless finds itself?or takes itself?to be excluded. It is, in Hegel's terms, Romantic sculpture, sculpture defined by its exile from its own most proper possibility, sculpture in the age of its impossibility: modern sculpture. The transition within Hegel's Aesthetics from the classic and sculptural to the modern plurality of painting and poetry and music is oddly difficult and divided, and necessarily so. Were art a real Hegelian subject, it would presumably come to fulfillment in its classical sculptural achievement (or, failing that, accomplish some further transformation toward its proper end on purely internal grounds). Because art is not a real subject but only a transient form inhabited by a thought that finally outraces it, the passage beyond art's apparent achievement is partly externally motivated?by Christianity, Hegel says?and partly internally driven (and both of these, he is also willing to say, amount to versions, or perhaps costs, of sculpture's tendency outward). On the internal side, what pushes classical sculpture beyond itself are above all the exigencies of representing action and the non-ideal subjectivities that are its condition and vehicle. Group sculpture is sculpture's passage beyond the terms of its achievement and so the first moment of its dissolution. What I've been calling Serra's late work renders a particularly difficult thought, which is at least partially caught by saying that it realizes a passage from an engagement with sculpture in its impossibility to a practice of group sculpture that is taking the measure of that impossibility as the ongoing condition of anything that can count as sculpture at all.26 What makes Serra a sculptor is precisely that he is interested in sculpture only its impossibility, apart from which there is nothing worth calling sculpture?nothing capable of doing the work only it can do. I take, of course, Serra's casual, but not I think careless, use of the word "absolute" as answering very precisely to this, and so it's worth noting now that it's a word he uses, positively or negatively, in 23.

Both Serra and his commentators have emphasized the "Baroque" character and inspiration of the Torqued Ellipses and related work. My focus on it as "group sculpture" is, in effect, a further interpretation of that claim.</page><page sequence="13">Melville: Richard Serra 197 a notably un-absolute way?that is, as subject to qualification: the rejected forged cube is, he says, "very" absolute, and Weight and Measure is "more" absolute than The Hours of the Day. Unqualified absoluteness is evidently foreclosed?and this shows both in Serra's continuously multiple practice and in the turn toward group sculpture that counts, as far as anything can, as securing the central impossibility that organizes Serra's work from the outset.27 "Absolute" appears then to be inseparable, in Serra's uses of it, from "becoming absolute," as if any term to that becoming?any apparent achievement of its end? would amount to losing everything. Presumably, this is just what it means to speak of sculpture in its impossibility: it is this struggle with its own necessary appearance as becoming that makes of its impossibility not a simple fact of historical belatedness but a structural moment, a condition of sculpture's actual and ongoing presence and of its claim on thought in its continuing achievement and inachievement. It is not that sculpture, or "we," come after the Greeks, but that "art" as such comes "after" culture: this is the defining knowledge of sculpture in the era of its impossibility, its only actual era. 3. For knowledge to be qualitatively other than relative knowledge, for it to be other than a knowledge which is carried over to what is known and bound there, it must not remain bound but must liberate and ab-solve itself from what it knows and yet as so ab-solved, as ab-solute, still be a knowledge.28 Heidegger's idea here is that "absolute" must mean for Hegel "not relative," and that "not relative" in turn must mean not dependent on?not bound to?the contingency (say, the mere givenness) of what is known. Even if the knowledge in question can claim more or less persuasively to know "everything" and to know that "everything" in all its necessary interlacing, it would remain relative in Heidegger's sense just to the extent that this "everything" continued to be thinkable as something knowledge more or less happened upon (as if it might have happened upon something else or might not have happened on anything at all). Knowledge of this sort?complete, exhaustive, and so on?would not amount to the "system of freedom" that is one of Hegel's deepest names for the knowledge he takes as absolute. Absolute knowledge must show as an essential element of its claim to be the knowledge it is, that what in it appears to be a relation to something other is in fact self-relation. As Heidegger puts it: "To be ab-solved from what is known does not mean 'abandoning' it, but 'preserving it by elevating it.' This elevation is an absolving which knows; that is, what is known is still known, but it being known it is now changed/'29 This, in effect, asks us to hear in Hegel's word "absolute" something we do not perhaps hear right away and perhaps also have trouble hearing continuously and consequentially. What it asks us to hear, in particular, is the difference between "absolute" taken as a shorthand of sorts for a claim about the scope of knowledge?we often register our sense of this by speaking of what is, perhaps problematically, "totalizing" in Hegel?and taken, as Heidegger would have us do, as marking a particular quality or even shape of knowledge (that it is, for example, "self-moving" and "in its own element").30 What Heidegger would evidently have his reader (that is, Hegel's reader) hear is not the solidity and, so to speak, impenetrability one might imagine proper to things conceived as absolutely themselves (as we perhaps imagine such things as rocks, and perhaps also as we might imagine "absolute authority"), but rather a peculiar mix of "detachment from . . ." (as if the detachment that in some sense defines a knowing insofar as it rests outside its object) and "relation to . . .," that must be grasped wholly as relation just because it is fundamentally shaped by its detachment from any apparently pr?existent terms. Heidegger solicits this 27. The argument here should be seen as both an extension and revision of that advanced by Rosalind Krauss in "Sculpture in the Expanded Field," in The Originality of the Avant-Garde. It can also be taken as expanding on Foster's remark in "The Un/making of Sculpture," that Serra "insists on the absolute status of sculpture as a language of its own .... But his work suggests that "structure" here is also differential, that his sculpture partakes of the other languages of painting and architecture in the very articulation of its difference," p. 183. 28.

By the same token, it helps us to hear the difference between absolute knowledge taken as knowledge's last and best form, succeeding on a long sequence of inadequate forms, and absolute knowledge taken as the name for the peace we might come to make with the inevitable shapedness and partiality of all those forms that amount to what we can mean or accomplish as knowing.</page><page sequence="14">198 RES 46 AUTUMN 2004 Richard Serra, Gravity, 1993.

Heidegger is offering a statement of?an argument about?what Hegel must mean by "absolute," so it's notable just how close the argument is to a mere reading aloud, as if sounding out the word "absolute," finding its rhythms, catching the break around which it forms. And it is equally notable how far that sounding of the word is already also its rewriting, finding as if within it sentences that do and do not repeat those in which it already figures. I am saying that Serra's sculpture is itself such a sounding of Hegel, catching in its own way the play of relation and externality that just is that thought's manifestness, its exposition as its continuing and necessary availability to reading. "Ab-solute" measures "absolute" at once against and within itself. The word's hyphenation does the same work?and for the same reason?that Heidegger performs differently in "The Origin of the Work of Art" when he teaches his reader to sound out "in": The stone in the road is a thing, as is the clod in the field. A jug is a thing, as is the well beside the road. But what about the milk in the jug and the water in the well? These too are things if the cloud in the sky and the thistle in the field, the leaf in the autumn breeze and the hawk over the wood, are rightly called by the name of thing. All these must indeed be called things, if the name is applied even to that which does not, like those just enumerated, show itself. . . . According to Kant, the whole of the world, for example, and even God himself, is a thing of this sort, a thing that does not itself appear, namely a "thing-in-itself."31 "The world, for example," Heidegger says, and then elsewhere writes: The upward glance spans the between of sky and earth. This between is measure out for the dwelling of man. We now call the span thus meted out the dimension. This dimension does not arise from the fact that sky and earth are turned toward one another. Rather, their facing itself depends on the dimension. . . . This measure-taking not only takes the measure of the earth, ge, and accordingly it is no mere geo-metry. Just as little does it ever take the measure of heaven, ouranos, for itself. Measure-taking is no science. Measure-taking gauges the between, which brings the two, heaven and earth, to one another. This measure-taking has its own metron, and thus its own metric. . . . Taking the measure of the dimension is the element within which human dwelling has its security, by which it securely endures. The taking of measure is what is poetic in dwelling. Poetry is a measuring.32 Writing this, Heidegger is reading H?lderlin, reading a moment, then, of poetic thinking, reading also a moment of difficult philosophic balance and passage, between Kant and Hegel, between philosophy claiming the shape of architecture and philosophy claiming the shape of sculpture, and so also and finally reading a poetry that in its radical modernity cannot but awaken the echo of its dialectical pr?figuration as architecture even as it also aspires, in that same modernity, toward a certain blankness?something that feels sometimes like irony and sometimes like the sheerest literalism?that would be its capturing of the condition of perhaps sculpture and perhaps philosophy or perhaps both. Well, that's all a bit of a hornet's nest, isn't it? And perhaps it would have been better not to stray so near it; certainly it's hard to know what might be too much and what too little to say here. But saying nothing is clearly saying far too little, leaving too much of the complex play of the aesthetic and the specificity of art's history unplumbed. It seems fair enough to say that, if there's something in Serra's sculpture and in his talk about it to which Heidegger can in some measure usefully attune our ears, sculpture itself remains essentially invisible to him, showing up?if it is indeed what's showing up? primarily in passages like this: But as a world opens itself the earth comes to rise up. It stands forth as that which bears all, as that which is sheltered in its own law and always wrapped up in itself. World demands its decisiveness and ?ts measure and lets beings attain to the Open of their paths. Earth, bearing and jutting, strives to keep itself closed and to entrust everything to its own law. The conflict is not a rift as a mere cleft is ripped open; rather, it is the intimacy with which opponents belong to each other. This rift caries the opponents into the source of their unity by virtue of their common ground. It is a basic design, an outline sketch, that draws the basic features of the rise of the lighting of beings. This rift does not let the opponents break apart; it brings the opposition of measure and boundary into their common outline.33 31. Martin Heidegger, Poetry, Language, Thought, trans. A.

Ibid., p. 63.</page><page sequence="16">200 RES 46 AUTUMN 2004 The dominant idiom here?borne above all by the insistence of the German Riss and its variants?is certainly that of drawing, weakly echoed by architecture. But the figure that comes slowly into focus across the passage?the opponents that do not break apart?particularly as it emerges out of the Riss's inflection toward "cleft," has increasingly the feel of a sculpture half-glimpsed and not quite nameable (but we might find that we have at least half-imagined it as the Laoco?n). Our sense that something like a sculpture? something like a group sculpture?has passed across our view gains a certain confirmation in the paragraph that follows, in Heidegger's way of speaking of how the work "occupies the Open of truth," and of how such occupying "can happen only if what is to be brought forth, the rift, entrusts itself to the self-secluding factor that juts up in the Open." The rift, he writes, "must set itself back into the heavy weight of stone, the dumb hardness of wood, the dark glow of colors. As the earth takes the rift back into itself, the rift is first set forth into the Open and thus placed, that is set, within that which towers up into the Open as self-closing and sheltering."34 Here too, it seems to me, one can be filled with a sense of something half-glimpsed and in a certain sense made for such half-glimpsing, Rilke's Rodin, one might suspect (a text and a work; a thing, a writing of that thing, a particular photography of it).35 If all of this amounts to something like an appearing, if not exactly showing, of sculpture, Heidegger's next paragraph appears to fade back into the more familiar terms of his thinking of art?the figure and shape that belong to design or drawing or painting and the fitting or joining that make up a frame or a framework, Gestalt and Ge-stell. We might call all this Heidegger's romanticism, and we would mean by that something like his participation in a modernism everywhere traversed or haunted by sculpture's impossibility and yet unable to test itself against that impossibility, thus closed against its acknowledgment. We'd then be imagining Heidegger and Serra as, in a certain sense, opponents bound by a rift that is not a mere cleft dividing them. . . . This seems to be about right, on the condition that we take such an imagination as marking not the place where our reading swallows itself, dissolving into infinitely self-mirroring indistinction, but as the remarking of the necessity of the reading's repetition and continuation (we have some reason to call this the reading's "absoluteness").36 And of course what we should want is some sharper sense of the stakes freed up by all this, and their answerability to the shape of Serra's sculptural thinking. 4. On the path we've followed, "measure" has repeatedly shown up, whether in the form of Holderlin's complex meters or Serra's various modes of site specificity, as a name for what the work does, thus what calls for reading and what such reading works to make visible or palpable. If Hegel ends by claiming that our fittedness to the world is the realization of our freedom in it, Kant separates these two moments, linking the first to the experience of the beautiful and the second to that of the sublime, respectively. He thus so offers us a strong contrast between one experience in which things are taken to show themselves as if immeasurable because they are already their own measure (so that in calling them "beautiful" we simply repeat a judgment that they in some sense already are or strike us as being; the judgment is more nearly in them than made by us) and another experience in which things show themselves as immeasurable because they exceed the measures demanded by our understanding and yet do not, for all that, escape our grasp?do not simply fail to show themselves?but instead awake in us a capacity for, in the most general terms, metaphor.37 Thus we find the literal and the metaphorical repeatedly crossing over in Kant's account of the sublime: ". . . we must base our judgment regarding [the starry sky] merely on how we see it, as a vast vault encompassing everything. . . . We must be able to view the ocean as poets do, merely in terms of what manifests itself to the eye?e.g., if we observe it while it is calm, as a clear mirror of water 34. Ibid., pp. 63-64. 35.

Is it necessary to underline how far these remarks about Gestalt, and Ge-stell, repetition and absoluteness, are remarks also about the deconstructive figures of parergon and mise-en-ab?me? 37.

"Genius"? Kant's name for this capacity for originality, for finding within the world new terms for its measure?is thus importantly promissory. This promise can feel like?Kant clearly takes it as?a matter of finally keeping faith with the past (the promise is to make sculpture, again) but it may equally show itself to be a matter of keeping faith with the future (the promise is that sculpture may yet be made). That Serra's early work is deeply oriented to this whole complex of genius and the sublime is beyond question as is its originality. But precisely because of that, what is in question is its sense?the shape of its promise and the terms in which that promise might be secured. The answer the late work advances is complex, offering, for example, no easy way to say either what has been kept faith with in the past or what future has been secured. In repetition and dispersion, the work becomes itself, absolutely, thinking through the shape of its time, and for describing this Kant's words and arguments can no longer serve. What we need is the thought that work comes to read in Hegel: that sculpture can secure itself as sculpture only in and as an acknowledgment of ?ts impossibility, and that in this it offers us particular prospects of solidarity and freedom, a particular shaping of something like a world. It is relatively uncontroversial to say that Serra's works consist of readings of their sites. This essay has, finally, not attempted to say anything different from that, although it clearly is at some pains to suggest that this reading goes deep enough that we need the words of Kant, and Hegel, and Heidegger to make out those sites and the readings the work accomplishes?that is, to say, fully or adequately, what the work is. If these pages have in fact worked as description, then to imagine that something ought still to be proved about what Serra himself might have read or not read?something shown, for example, about how he might or might not have come across the word "absolute"?may be to saddle oneself with an artificially diminished sense of what it is for a person to choose his or her words, to inhabit a language. It would be above all to mistake the thought?the theory or argument, auseinandersetzung or polemos?that the work itself (this material, this construction, these forms, these sites) is, the differences it can make. 38.
