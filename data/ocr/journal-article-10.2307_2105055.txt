<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEIDEGGER ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON 1 To summarize the content and to adequately report on a work by Heidegger is an almost impossible task. For the procedure he has adopted for many years is that of an analysis or, rather, interpretation of language, chiefly of German and Greek. It is often difficult to render exactly a term of one language into another language. While this may be done, to some extent, with isolated terms, the difficulties become truly unsurmountable when the argument is based on etymological kinship and on consideration of the meaning a word had - supposedly or demonstrably - at the time when it first came to be used. The filiation of terms being different in every language, much of the apparent suggestivity of such interpretation is lost completely in even the most careful translation. The expression "principle of sufficient reason" has been used first by Leibniz who wrote in Latin and called this principle the principium nobilissimum et grande. He stated it in the form: Nihil est sine ratione, and viewed it, together with the principle of contradiction, as absolutely fundamental, prior to all other principles. In the eighteenth century a proposition of axiomatic or fundamental nature came to be called a Grundsatz. And ratio, in this proposition, became Grund. Moreover, sulficiens was rendered by zureichend: Der Satz - or Grundsatz - vom zureichenden Grund. These facts are pointed out by Heidegger himself. But the history of words assumes, with Heidegger, a peculier significance. Language is envisaged as the "house of BEING" 2 and its history reveals the status, as it were, not only of speculation concerning BEING, of the Seinsfrage, but something of the mode in which BEING becomes manifest in different periods of history. Consequently, the emergence of the new German terms achieves a definite philosophical significance. The etymological family to which Grund belongs is another then that 1 Martin Heidegger, Der Satz vom Grund, Pfullingen: G. Neske, 1957, p. 211. The book contains the unaltered text of a course given at the University of Freiburg i.B., 1955/56; a few additional remarks are set into ( ). P. 189 follows a lecture delivered at Bremen and Vienna in 1956 which repeats in a summary form the content of the course. There are neither footnotes nor an index. 2 BEING will be used to render das Sein, as set over against the Being of beings, das Sein der Seienden. 365</page><page sequence="2">366 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH where reason or ratio is at home. Many German idioms related to Grund have no counterpart in any other language, certainly not in English or the Romance languages. The word has many meanings, ranging from "bottom" through "soil" or "terrain" to reason and motivation. It is one of the methodological convictions of Heidegger that such diversities of meaning arise from some intrinsic relationships, and that what one might call their common semantic denominator reveals the most profound and most significant meaning underlying all the several terms. It is obvious that arguments constructed on these lines can never be reproduced ade- quately in another language. Under these circumstances it seems preferable that one report but succinctly on Heidegger's rather longwinded and sometimes repetitious argument and its results, and devote more space to certain points whose discussion will, perhaps, contribute to the elucidation and the critical appraisal of the general intent and the background of this philosophy. I Nothing is without reason; all that is has a reason. This proposition itself "is", and thus requires a reason. Hence, the threat of an endless regress; for the principle claims absolute universality, but this is a propo- sition of an unique kind: "The principle of reason is the reason of the principle" (p. 31). It is the highest principle of fll principles, prior even to that of contradiction. That it lasted so many centuries of "incubation" until the principle was formulated by Leibniz is a significant fact in the "history" of BEING. Leibniz refers to this principle also as that reddendae rations sufficientis Heidegger holds that this second formula is the "stricter" one and has been considered as such also by Leibniz himself. (No evidence is supplied for this statement; see below.) More than two thousand years passed before this principle was stated explicitly, although it had been effective ever since. This is referred to by Heidegger as the "period of incubation," one of "evasiveness" (Entzug) on the part of BEING: "BEING is not yet as such awake thus that It would look at us in his awakened essence" (p. 97) 3. That incubation came to an end is owed to "that something has changed in the Geschick 4 of BEING." Instead, however of revealing 3 Essence is the only available, but most inadequate rendering of Wesen. The absence of any more suitable term is the source of confusion and misunderstanding, not only in the case of Heidegger but also of Hegel and Kierkegaard. 4 Geschick is another untranslatable term, especially in view of the use Heidegger makes of it. For him, in this word converge such different meanings as: message and sending and destiny; there is also a relationship with Geschichte. This is another example of Heidegger's notion of the significance of etymological facts - or theories - for specu- lation on BEING.</page><page sequence="3">HEIDEGGER ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON 367 itself, BEING became concealed, because under the rule of the principle of sufficient reason developed the search for the reason of all that is, so that BEING only "appeared" in the objectivity of objects (or the being- set-over-against). Consequently, one was preoccupied exclusively with searching for reasons or causes; the end of the period of "incubation" is the beginning of the age of science and technology which has attained its climax today in the "atomic age." In a new form, the "forgetfulness of BEING" dominated the Western world. This development was possible because the proposition in which the principle is stated can be read in two ways or, as Heidegger says, in "two keys," according to whether the emphasis is placed on "nothing" and "without" or on "is" and "reason." It is by listening to the second "key" that the truly significant meaning reveals itself. The principle which speaks of reason (or "ground")- speaks in verity of BEING. BEING "sends itself," addresses us, but thus as to elude us at the same time. This self- sending is another in each period of history. BEING witdraws itself, and it is completely concealed in the knowing-itself of the absolute spirit; metaphysics is completed in German idealism and, therefore, has reached its end. The last reason has no reason. Heard in the "second key," the principle tells us that BEING and Reason, Grund, are one and the same. BEING is Ground; but as unfathomable it is also Abgrund, abyss. To think in the manner dictated by the "second key" is contrary to all to which the mind is accustomed. What is required is a "leap." 5 Only by leaping one passes from the first to the second "key." There is no transition, nor any terrain, so to speak, through which one could 5 The term "leap" is, of course, reminiscent of Kierkegaard, but also of Hegel. Cf. Phenomenology, ed. J. Hoffmeister, Leipzig: Meiner, 5th ed., 1949, p. 15: Here Heidegger indulges in what appears, in truth, as a gratuitous play with words. Satz, he points out, means in German both proposition or sentence, and leap. Thus, the Satz vom Grund becomes a Satz in den Grund. The etymological and semantic relationships one would have to consider in this respect, are more complex than Heidegger apparently assumes. It is a curious fact that the Germanic languages have created a transitive verb as a correlate to the intransitive sedere: to sit and to seat, sitzen and setzen. (Cf. also the French asseoir, a transitive verb; to sit becomes in French to be seated: 9tre assis.) Thus, the transitive forms designate what in Latin is expressed by ponere: the-propo- sition is a Satz. Apart from the questionable legitimacy of the philological rapproche- ments, there is another point to be made. Every proposition is a Satz. Why then, is it only this one proposition which speaks of the principle of sufficient reason that is qualified as a leap? It may be, indeed, possible to view every proposition as a sort of leap, in a sense not alien to Hegel's way of thinking. Then, the peculiarity or even uniqueness of the proposition under discussion would not reside in that it is a leap, that is, not in its formal nature, but in the material significance of the terms brought together in the proposition. This, however, is tantamount to saying that Heidegger's argument presupposes what it claims to demonstrate.</page><page sequence="4">368 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH proceed from the first to the second. Leaping, nevertheless, implies the crossing of a distance and a medium wherein the leap is executed. "The leap hangs in the air. In what air... ? This we learn only by the leap" (p. 96). It is a leap "into BEING as Being, that is, as ground." The bottomless abyss, then, which is also the plenitude of BEING, is the last reason and the ultimate ground of all that is. The utterances of BEING, if one may say so, differ in different ages. BEING addresses us, sends Itself, conveys a message in and through the Being of beings. In manifesting thus itself, it withdraws itself at the same time. The conclusion does not come as a surprise. It has been adumbrated or even stated in several earlier writings.6 It is, moreover, inevitable. For if BEING is that by virtue of which every being is, from the human person to the abstract proposition, and if everything that is or happens has a reason, what else could be the "reason of the reason" but BEING? 7 It is, therefore, doubtful whether our philosophical insight has grown or been deepened by the outcome of Heidegger's long argument. It may be, however, that to demonstrate this thesis has not been the main concern of the author. The title and all the lengthy discussions notwithstanding, what Heidegger really wants to do is to offer an analysis of the present phase of history. (See below sub III). It is, indeed, true that the principle of sufficient reason has not been expressly formulated before Leibniz. But it has been widely used and tacitly assumed. Aristotle in speaking of the Prime Mover, St. Thomas in outlining his "five ways" by which to prove the existence of God, all thinkers even if they were not concerned with BEING but only with the Being of beings, have appealed to this principle. Leibniz himself refers to it as to one of common knowledge. His claim is not to have "discovered" 6 E.g., Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik, Bonn: Cohen, 1929, pp. 39, 107, 226; Platons Lehre von der Wahrheit, Bern: Francke; 1947, p. 15; part. in the essay on Rilke, Holzwege, Frankfort o.M.: Klostermann, 1950; pp. 248-295. 7 Leibniz is quoted (p. 53) as stating the necessity of a last reason, ultima ratio rerum. He says of his principle that it is vulgo stated as: everything has a cause, which formula Heidegger seems to view as coextensive with the other. This is not quite certain. In a text, probably of 1679, Leibniz notes:... esse quidem nihil sine ratione sed non ideo esse sine causa. Nam causa est ratio rei extra rem ... potest vero ratio rei esse intra rem ipsam. Idque, locum habet in illis quae rationed in se ipsis continent... (A. Grua, G. W. Leibniz. Textes inedits, Paris: Presses Universitaires, 1948, p. 13). Also Ibid., p. 268, text dated XI.27.1677: et ea (se. ratio sufficient) debet esse extra series. The first text is entitled: axioma magnum. Leibniz also writes: principium, grande, which expression Heidegger renders as "of great might". This would be correct if Leibniz's Latin were that of Rome or even of the Humanists of the Renaissance. But his Latin is vitiated by many Ger- manisms and Gallicisms. It is probable that to him magnum and grande were synony- mous terms (cf. grand in French). Thus it becomes doubtful whether the emphasis on "might" is truly justified. Grande and magnum already become synonymous in medieval Latin.</page><page sequence="5">HEIDEGGER ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON 369 the principle, but to have recognized its fundamental significance. To speak, therefor, as Heidegger does of a "period of incubation" in the strict sense of the term is an exaggeration of questionable legitimacy. II Since the final outcome is more or less a foregone conclusion and not open to any criticism, it is the method by which the author arrives at it which requires examination. It is, as one knows, a favorite procedure of Heidegger to take a text, to interpret, and to comment on it. Linguistic analysis and etymological explanation have replaced phenomenology. Heidegger is convinced of his ability to rethink the original meaning of the sayings of his predecessors, philosophers or poets. He claims to "think in the Greek manner" - griech- isch denken - and feels entitled to render the texts by what he calls "eluci- dating (erliuternde) translations." 8. In this book, however, the two most important quotations are not taken from Greek authors, but from Angelus Silesius and from Leibniz. The first text reads: Die Ros is ohn warm; sie bijihet, weil sie bliihet./Sie acht nicht ihrer selbst, fragt nicht, ob man sie siehet. The denial of the warm, says Heidegger, and the affirmation of the weil seem to contradict each other. His solution: warm is the word for the question concerning reason (Grund) and weil the answer. This does not make the ostensible contra- diction disappear. In fact, there is none, for warm refers to an end, and weil to a cause. The rose, says Silesius, by her very being fills the place allotted to her by the Creator; she "seeketh not her own." Nor is the meaning of "acht" that of taking care; the couplet affirms that the rose does not seek approval or admiration. The sense of the two lines is moral rather than metaphysical. The manner in which Heidegger deals with his texts becomes even more evident in his discussion of the two formulae of Leibniz. No proof is given 8 Of these interpretations "whose ingeniosity is apt to excite rather our admiration than win our consent" (A. de Waelhens, Chemins et impasses de l'ontoloyie Heideygerienne, Louvain: Nauwelaerts, 1953, p. 41), one of the most amazing is that of fragment No. 123 of Heraclitus: p6amq xp6nva&amp;ocT cptet. The verb is usually taken to mean "to like," in the sense of regularly, frequently happening. So also in Austrian dialect gerne; gerne haben is to like, es yeschieht gerne means it happens often. The anthropomorphic or animistic connotation is completely lost. The same may well have been the case with the Greek at the time of Heraclitus. Not so Heidegger, p. 113: "What means, in Greek thought, qctLeV, to love?.... Belonging together in the same. Heraclitus wants to say that to BEING belongs hiding itself." As always, there is no proof. Such apodictic statements may do in the classroom. But the reader has the right to be given, and the writer correspondingly the obligation to furnish, the reasons for such renderings. The verba magistri are without value in scholarly literature.</page><page sequence="6">370 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH for the claim that Leibniz considered the formula reddendae rations as the stricter one. It is not at all certain that the two formulae meant the same to Leibniz. Heidegger himself quotes Leibniz for saying that he "uses" the second formula in "reasoning" (ratiocinatio). That is, the simpler formula has an ontological, the longer a methodological, signifi- cance. Heidegger is not unaware of this. But he brushes such notions aside because to him being and knowing are identical, as he has explained to great length in his analysis of a Parmenidean text. Having thus established the identity of the two formulae and decreed that the longer one is also the stricter, Heidegger bases much of his further arguments on the interpretation of reddere which he takes in its literal sense of "giving back." 9 It would be by far too long were one to follow his reasoning. A large part of it rests, of course, on linguistic speculations. By translating reddere as zurilck- or zustellen, he finds ways and means to relate the reddere rationem to vorstellen - what is delivered, as e.g., mail, is "placed before" one, thus it "stands in face" and becomes Gegenstand; and so on. BEING, of course, is never an "object"; in regard to the latter, Heidegger adopts the viewpoint of post-Cartesian philosophy: object is what is present to the subject. This identification, however, is the outcome of a more fundamental conviction which is, perhaps, never stated explicitly but is clearly basic to Heidegger's philosophy. BEING is an univocal term. This makes possible to say of a proposition that it "be." And also explains why Hei- degger sees in the distinction of sensible and nonsensible being one of the great and fateful errors of classical metaphysics. The idea of BEING as an univocal term may be traced, presumably, to three sources. One is Duns Scotus to whose philosophy Heidegger has devoted a penetrating study and with whom this notion is basic.10 The 9 Whether this is correct is debatable. The prefix re- means, indeed, primarily "back to..." But this sense is modified in numerous expressions, so that the reference is often to "against," "again," and may also have a merely emphatic significance. What is "given back" and to whom in translation? Cicero already uses reddere in this sense. (De orat. I, 34. 155). The word may mean also simply to "tell," to "enumerate." (Quinc- tilian, Institutiones, XJ.2.23). Modern Romance languages use the derivatives of reddere and of dare often as synonyms. One may say reddir razon but also dar razon. Cf. rendre a~nd donner. The original sense of a term may be lost completely so that it is no longer effective, not even in the "unsaid" of an author. 10 Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus, Tubingen: Mohr 1916.

On univocity of Being as the "fundamental position" of Duns Scotus, cf. E. Gilson, History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Agas, New York: Random House, 1955, pp. 456, 764.

And then, there is legel. It has been noted by several authors that there exists a definite relation- ship of Hegel's conception and that of Heidegger. Heidegger is indebted. to Hegel, says de Waelhens,11 for the idea that "Being and metaphysics are not 'something' to be apprehended but a development that unfolds." References to Hegel are numerous in Heidegger's writings, beginning with the book on Scotus. But both kinship and difference has never come to the fore as clearly as in the present work. Heidegger's philosophy is, of course, not simply an unadulterated Hegelianism; it cannot be this, for Hegel's system is viewed, as all other metaphysics are, as concerned with the Being of beings and as neglecting the Seinsfrage.12 There is, nevertheless, a striking parallelism between Heidegger's BEING and the Idea, Concept, Absolute in Hegel., Since BEING is the source of everything that is, including all possible predi- cation, one cannot attribute to it any properties. But it is inevitable that one speak in attributes and thus as if BEING possessed properties; what we name in this manner is, however, better designated as "manifestation" of BEING quoad nos.13 In manifesting Itself, BEING, which "addresses" us differently in different ages, displays some sort of dynamics, not unlike the unfolding of the Hegelian Absolute. But the latter "obeys," as it were, its own intrinsic necessity, whereas there seems to be no such "logic" in the case of BEING. Nevertheless, BEING, "has" a history, and this history is the determi- nant of history in the usual sense. Previously, Heidegger's - not further explained 14 - statements seemed to suggest that the course of history versity of Being in the Doctrine of Meister Eckhart of Hochheim, New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1939. 11 A. de Waelhens, La Philosophie de Martin Heidegger, Louvain: Publications Universitaires, 4th ed., 1935, p. 318.

(M. Heidegger, Zur Seinsfrage, Frankfort o.M.: Kloster- mann, 1955, p. 26). 13 If one were to look for similar ideas in the history of philosophy, it is less the Plotinian One of which one is reminded, than the doctrine on God in St. Augustine: Deus est quod habet, and the principle of the coincidence of existence and essence in God, as it was maintained throughout the Middle Ages. Also of the idea of docta ignorantia, from S. Augustine to Nicholas Cusanus. 14 Cf. Jean Wahl, Vers la fin de l'ontologie, Paris: Sedes, 1956. One may find a further resemblance to Hegel in Heidegger's, indeed, rather aphoristic comments on the re- lationships obtaining among various features of our times; something like the Zeitgeist</page><page sequence="8">372 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH depended on the manner in which BEING had been understood and that for the failure to take account of BEING, metaphysics had to be made responsible. This seems to be Heidegger's view also today, but with an important modification for the "message" of BEING has to be understood anew in each age; it does not remain the same. History, thus, is shaped by the manner in which, one cannot know why and how, BEING reveals and - at the same time - withdraws Itself on one hand, and by the manner this manifestation is apprehended by man. Whatever its particular form, there is in this philosophy an unmistakable quasi-Hegelian dynamism. History appears as, at least, partially determin- ed by the superpersonal and transcendent BEING, by virtue of its mani- festing Itself in an unaccountable manner differently in every age. Man's contribution to history is limited, it seems, to his heeding or not heeding the message of BEING. He has failled to do so since the times of Plato. Philosophy has been concerned with the Being of beings and has fallen into the "forgetfullness of BEING." Especially since the seventeenth century - which, as Heidegger justly remarks, initiates the last period and the climax of the modern age - the principle of sufficient reason has ruled supreme. It is that principle which underlies, and the obedience to it has made possible, the development of science and technology. The corresponding metaphysics has attained its height and conclusion in Hegelian Idealism, and met its catastrophe in consequence of the phi- losophy of Nietzsche. All further progress on these lines is barred. III The conclusion of the book is not surprising and the arguments which support it are not cogent. There is, however, another feature which lends to the discussion a peculiar coloring; it is particularly noticeable in the appended Lecture. There are passages which are permeated by a curious mood of resignation; one is tempted to speak of an "eschatological senti- ment." It is as if the author were continually thinking of two sayings of his predecessor Hegel - of the one which identifies the history of the world with the judgment on the world, and the other that "when philosophy paints her picture grey in grey, an age of the world has become old, and philosophy can do nothing to rejuvenate it." The modern age, Heidegger is suggested. It is not uninteresting to note also that Heidegger's rapprochement of Parmenides and Heraclitus has its parallel in Hegel. The "dialectical examples" of the Eleatics "have as results the pure being of Parmenides, by demonstrating the disso- lution of all determined being in itself, and are thus ... the Heraclitean flux" Wissen- schaft der Logik, 3d ed., Vol. I, p. 227 (Werke, Vol. III, Berlin: Duncker &amp; Humblodt, 1833).</page><page sequence="9">HEIDEGGER ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON 373 seems to feel, draws to its end. And the end is not pleasant. The Western world is not dying, but the mind which created it has lost its vitality. Under the rule of the principle of sufficient reason, Western man has surrendered to science and technology to a point where he names his own age after the energy he has unchained: the atomic age.15 It is impossible that mankind retrace its steps; there is no returning to Parmenides and the original intuition of BEING. On the other hand, no further advance is possible on the path which metaphysical speculation went up to the modern age. Unless a new approach is adopted, one which would render man again conscious of the primary importance of BEING and the reflection thereon, the life of the spirit will inevitably be suffocated by the all-pervading technicalization. Heidegger sees a symptom of this development also in modern art whose creations, he says, have not as yet been given an appropriate name; that of "work of art," in the old sense, does not apply. Modern man has become the victim of "the fury of an exclusively calculating way of thought." Nonetheless, "human nature, man's be- longiness to BEING, the essence of BEING Itself, remain what is worthy of thought (denkwfirdig) ... We are bound to find ways, by which thought may respond to that which deserves to be thought... This is the world- question... The manner in which it is answered will decide what becomes of this earth and of man's existence..." Thus Heidegger concludes his lecture. But the does not tell us any more than in earlier works, why and how the vision of BEING determines man's fate. One wonders: if history and destiny are the result of the way BEING addresses man, and destiny (Geschick) is the history of BEING (Seinsgeschichte), what is man's in- fluence on the march of history? Where is there, in this philosophy, a place for freedom? Until now, Heidegger has not furnished an answer. RUDOLF ALLERS. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. 15 This may be debatable. Periods of history have been named according to the material, the forces, the tools employed for an increasing domination of the environl mental world: the iron age, the age of electricity, the machine age.</page></plain_text>
