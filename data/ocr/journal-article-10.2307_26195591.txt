<plain_text><page sequence="1">Traditional Islam in the Modern World By SEYYED HOSSEIN NASR. 2nd edn. London: Kegan Paul International, 1990. Pp. 335. Price PB £9.95. 0-7103-0332-7. First published in 1987, this collection of eighteen essays constitutes a spirited defence of traditional Islam against both modernism (whether European or Islamic) and its contrary, fundamentalism. S. H. Nasr, well known for his many studies of Islamic science, culture, and spirituality, here touches upon a wide array of subjects in an attempt to correct not only the standard distortions of orientalism, but also the misinterpretations deriving from political journalism, Marxism, and so-called 'resurgent Islam'. The first section, 'Facets of the Islamic Tradition', discusses apparently down-to-earth subjects such as jihad, work ethics, and male-female relations</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 2.61 in order to demonstrate the notion of tradition as the all-encompassing revelation of the sacred through both history and nature. Building explicitly on the work of exponents of the Perennial Philosophy (especially Rene Guenon and Frithjof Schuon), these sections tie tradition to specifically Islamic touchstones: the terms dm and sunna, the standard hadith collections (both Sunni and Shi'i), Safavid Iran, and Sufism. At the same time, it may be remarked that the very abstraction of certain neologisms used here (e.g. 'Islamicity', 'Shari'ite'), and the synthetic transcendence of historical tensions such as that between Sunnis and Shi'is, point towards the recent and retrospective nature of the defence of tradition. In other words, before the specific cultural crises caused by modernism, it was neither necessary nor possible to formulate a defence of tradition as such. Part II, 'Traditional Islam and Modernism', dwells further on the contrast between the modern anthropomorphic lack of principles and the wholeness and transcendence characteristic of traditional attitudes. Nasr's criticisms of modernistic traits (especially the political reduction of religion to ideology or ethics) are often astute and revealing. Part III, 'Tradition and Modernism—Tensions in Various Cultural Domains', builds up the cumulative critique of modernism with seven essays that urgently call upon Muslim intellectuals to take stock of their plight. The main areas discussed here are education, philosophy, and architecture, in all of which, argues Nasr, Western influence has systematically eroded the original Islamic basis in most Muslim countries. Numerous recommendations, both specific and general, are presented for dealing with the unfortunate aspects of Western modernism; a new 'occidentalism' is clearly necessary to provide a systematic critique of the West's modern alienation from God. Part IV, 'Western Interpreters of the Islamic Tradition', delivers warm testimonies to a few European scholars who have transcended orientalism by their intense personal engagement with Islam. A Catholic (Louis Massignon), a Protestant (Henry Corbin), and a Muslim (Titus Burckhardt) are presented as reminders that there can be genuine spiritual encounters with Islam on the part of Western intellectuals who have not succumbed to secularism and modernism. The concluding 'Postscript' adds messianism to the list of Muslim responses to modernism, and gives final reflections on the significance of modernism itself, the various trends commonly lumped together as 'fundamentalism', and the remaining representatives of traditional Islam. Nasr speaks passionately but irenically of the need for an intellectual dimension to the critique of modernism. His work will be of considerable interest to Muslims seeking that intellectual grounding in tradition, and it will also be worth the attention of students of contemporary movements in Islamic thought. At a time when the Western public identifies Islam with terrorists, when ideologists claim to incarnate true Islam, Nasr's traditionalist critique provides a provocative alternative view.
