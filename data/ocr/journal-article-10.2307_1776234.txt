<plain_text><page sequence="1">336 THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PR)BABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. A.D. That in the days of the Roman Empire the Mozambique coast and the Zambezi were beyond the ken of geographers seems apparent both from Ptolemy and from the Periplus of the " Red sea." For the identi- fication of the sites mentioned in these two works, reference may be made to the standard authority of Guillain, who considered Rhapta, the most southern place mentioned, to have been situated on the Rufiji- that is to say, in 8? of S. lat. The documentary evidence, therefore, on the one hand, absolutely forbids us to suppose that Arabs, or any other people known to the ancient geographers, penetrated as far south as Cape Delgado; and, on the other hand, it is too defective to justify the inference frequently drawn from the mere catalogue of place-names, viz. that any considerable trade existed in Grseco-Roman times, even with what is now British and German East Africa. Until the spade of the explorer comes to our assistance, we can only safely affirm that these countries were not absolutely unknown at that period. A fortiori, if I would suspend judgment with regard to so late a time as that of the Roman Empire, I refuse to discuss anything so shadowy as the possibility of a yet earlier trade with any country further south than Somaliland, the Punt of the Egyptians. Ethnological data are not in any way inconsistent with this attitude. Granting, what seems to be the case, that the racial type of the peoples at present existing all down the East Coast betrays Semitic me'tissage in varying amounts, yet it cannot be proved that south of the equator the intrusion of this foreign racial element is not comparatively recent. Before the discussion, the Chairman (Sir THOMAs HOLDICH) read the following communications:- From Dr. ARTHUR EVANS, F.R.S.: My opinion on the question of Zimbabwe can have no special value. I know nothing personally of that part of Africa. On the other hand, I was long ago negatively convinced that the supposed evidence of early contact with Arabia or Phonicia had no real basis. In fact, it seemed to me that there was nothing in the architecture or the remains discovered in common with either early Arabian or Phoenician models as far as they were known. On the occasion of a lecture by Mr. Hall at Oxford, I pointed out the great pre- sumption that there was that the existing ruins were simply enlarged examples of native kraals. I regard Mr. MacIver's researches as having been carried out by the true scientific method, and, so far as the dating goes, I think that he has made out a satisfactory case for their late mediseval origin. But I have not the local knowledge to express myself in any other than in general terms. From Prof. J. W. GREGORY, F.R.S.: Looking at the date of the prehistoric mining in Rhodesia from a mining point of view, it is certain that some of the mines were modern, but that others may be of considerable antiquity. It is clear, from their size and extent, that a large amount of gold has been derived from them, and by mining methods unlike those adopted, to my knowledge, by any uninstructed negro people. That the original mining instructors were either Phoenicians or people under Phoenician influence, is supported by the shape of their ingots. They were " astragali," to use the term by which Diodorus described the tin ingots obtained by the Phoenicians from Cornwall. The shape of Cornish</page><page sequence="2">THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. 337 astragali is known from the specimen dredged at the entrance to Falmouth harbour and described by Sir Henry James.* Its form is shown on the accompanying figure, for comparison with the cavity of an ingot-mould found 2 at Zimbabwe and now in the \ Capetown Museum. For the opportunity of measuring it, I am indebted to Mr. Wm. Sclater. It seems to me improbable that negroes in East Africa should have stumbled by chance on the same pattern of ingot as those which the Phoenicians used in Cornwall; so that, whoever ac- tually built Zimbabwe, it seems probable that there are traces of Phoenician influence on the early ___ mining industry of Rhodesia. This resemblance has been pre- 1, TIN INGOT, FAL- 2, INGOT MOULD, ZIMBABWE. viously remarked by Bent. MOUTH. Dimensions. Dr. KEANE: I should like to DimenEsions.

I refer, The outer shape of the mould is approximate. in the first instance, to those objects on which the Semitic school builds its first argument. Such are the conic tower and the other smaller cones, the slate beams, the birds, and the phalli, and other such objects which are not found anywhere else in Africa, which the Africans would be quite incapable of making, and which, on the other hand, point most directly to Semitic worship as known to us from the remains in South Arabia, in Syria, in Sardinia, and elsewhere in the Mediterranean lands. All these objects are passed over in absolute silence, as is also the drainage system, which reminds us much more of the Roman Cloaca Maxima than of any similar structures which have ever been constructed by the aborigines. I come now to the mines, to the gold workings, which are admittedly in intimate association with the monuments above ground, and are fully described by Bent, Maund, and others. Maund refers to the tens of thousands of slaves who must have been at work in the mines, and the millions of tons which must have been overturned in their search for gold, of which some seventy-five million pounds sterling are stated by good judges to have been recovered from these workings. Mr. J. M. Stewart also speaks of the numerous workings which are mentioned in my ' Boer States,' p. 43, and which show that centuries ago mining was practised on a most extensive scale, that vast quantities of ore had been worked, and that by "engineers of a very high order." During his look around, has Mr. MacIver discovered any aborigines who could be described as engineers of a very high order ? On the second part of his theme, the knowledge or ignorance possessed by the * 'Note on the Block of Tin dredged up in Falmouth Harbour.'

On the Periplus fresh light has recently been thrown by Eduard Glaser, who has discovered that it was composed by a certain Basil of Alexandria, who was evidently much interested in the trade of the Far East. This Basil describes the navigation of the east coast of Africa down, not merely to Cape Rhapta, but all the way to the extremity of the continent. He mentions the island of Menuthias, which must be absolutely identical with Madagascar. There were large rivers teeming with crocodiles, and there were also wickerwork weirs for catching fish, a description which tallies with Madagascar and with no other island on the east coast. He says, further, that the Indian ocean trended round westwards, and eventually mingled with the waters on the other side of Africa- that is, the Atlantic ocean. Now, Basil lived in the time of Nero, consequently it was then known that Africa was an island. But it was also known to be an island long before that period. Herodotus, who is often misquoted on this point, tells us plainly (iv. 42) that King Nechos, about 610, equipped an expedition conducted by Phoenicians, who sailed round Africa in three years and came back by the Pillars of Hercules to Egypt, having started from the head of the Red sea. He says, moreover, that Africa was thus proved to be ireplIpUros, which means circumnavigable, all except the isthmus of Suez; and he further adds that Nechos proved this for the first time. What he disbelieves was, not the circumnavigation, but the statement of the circumnavigators, that they had the sun always on their right hand, which, of course, he could not then understand. There is just one other point. I mentioned in the introduction to Mr. Hall's 'Great Zambabwe,' and also in 'The Gold of Ophir,' that the ancients were well acquainted with Madagascar and had continuous intercourse with it at a very remote period, and I am now glad to say that I am supported in this statement by M. Grandidier, who is facile princeps in everything connected with the subject of Madagascar. He writes me that he has proof that they were connected with the Comoro islands, and that colonists were sent out, not only from South Arabia, but from Idumea, who settled in those parts. And mention is made by the author of the Periplus of the "Fire men," a most appropriate epithet for the inhabitants of these Comoro islands, where active volcanoes still exist almost in sight of Rhodesia. Therefore, there was no conceivable trouble for the Arabians and the Phaenicians, who had fleets in the Indian ocean, to reach these regions in quest of gold. Mr. R. N. HALL: Mr. Maclver's paper is noticeable for certain omissions. In the main Mr. MacIver has fixed upon certain ruins, Dhlo Dhlo and Khami, as determining the general character and age of the whole of the ruins in these territories, which groups seven years ago were shown by Mr. Neal, Dr. Schlichter, Mr. Telford Edwards, and myself not to possess any claim to remote antiquity. He gathers the whole of the ruins into one class, notwithstanding that it is admitted by archaeological experts, and by architects and practical builders, that there are widely varying styles of architecture, plan, and construc- tion, each type occupying certain defined areas, and each yielding relics only found in such particular type of ruin. Also, in his description of any one ruin, say Great Zimbabwe, he passes as belonging to one alleged Kafir period, all reconstructions and extensions, as part of the original buildings, notwithstanding such groups-Zimbabwe, in particular- show obviously successive occupations and buildings of several distinct periods. The paper is conspicuous for the omission of references to the numerous and lengthy chains of forts, which, in his block-house system, protect well-defined</page><page sequence="4">THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. 339 routes throughout the country, and also leading towards the coast. It makes no reference to the conical tower and its allied platform and parallel passage, and to the hundreds of phalli found in the older type of ruin, and in such only where the exceptionally well-built, massive curved walls, with mural decoration, surmounted with conical towers or monoliths, or both, are directed towards the east or west. It fails to explain the alleged parallelisms existing between the architecture and construction, plan and mural decoration, of undoubted ancient buildings in South Arabia-Marib, for instance, and those of the oldest type of building in Rhodesia, and of the parallelisms, if not identity, as pointed out by Dr. Keane, existing between the hill terraces of Inyanga and the hill terraces of South Arabia. It is silent as to the undoubted evidences of a certain degree of civilization testified to in skill of building, with elaborate system of drainage and military defence, also in mining and assaying of reefs, and most emphatically and unanimously demonstrated by a very large body of expert opinion as being altogether beyond the capacities of existing Kafir races. Over 450 years ago, De Barros stated that Makalanga, "naked and savage," lived within the Zimbabwe temple, but these were so abso- lutely ignorant of the origin of the ruins, possessing no tradition concerning them, that they said they were erected by the devil "because they (the ruins) were beyond their powers to execute." The Makalanga of to-day say exactly the same as their ancestors of more than 450 years ago. The paper, too,'ignores the close association found in every single instance of phallus and bird, and the fact that the birds are further associated with conical towers, and that all the birds were discovered occupying an eastward position. Mr. Maclver considers the bird to be but a Kafir tribal totem; but there is no post- mediaeval record to this effect, nor any traditions among the natives, with whom tradition dies exceedingly hard. The existence of any tribe with the eagle for its totem is quite possible, for there is not a single specimen in natural history pertain- ing to South Africa which has not been appropriated for tutem by some Kafir race, tribe, sub-tribe, family, or caste. But surely conical towers, platforms, parallel passages, carved birds, phalli, all found in close association, and never otherwise, point distinctly to some Semitic influence. The architecture, plan, and construction of buildings, the form of religious worship practised at Zimbabwe, and the methods of ancient mining in Rhodesia, and the Semitic impression on the Makalanga, all testify, so the most authoritative experts have always maintained, to Semitic influence in some period of antiquity. Nor does Mr. MacIver explain why-if, as he alleges, our monuments are of Kafir work-such monuments should be absolutely confined to one area of the country, and why they are not to be found in any other part of Africa south of the equator. Mr. Maclver admits he paid no attention whatever to the ancient gold- mines, yet he practically suggests that the scores of millions of pounds' worth of gold extracted from the rock in the oldest mines was placed on the world's metal market in post-mediaeval times. This is a suggestion unwarranted by history, research, and the evidence presented by the mines. The post-mediaeval references to the gold export from this country distinctly relate to alluvial, or shed-gold washed from the river-beds. For instance, " the Kafirs from Monomotapa prefer the gold taken from the rivers to that taken from the mines." The Arabian historians of between 900 and 1150 A.D. speak of the export of gold from Sofala as a long-established and flourishing trade. Fourteen years ago Mr. John Hays Hammond, the well-known gold-mining expert, reported that from the oldest type of gold-mines many scores of millions of pounds' worth of gold had been extracted in some very remote period of antiquity; also, that there had been</page><page sequence="5">340 THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. successions of gold-mining at different periods. Eight years ago Mr. Telford Edwards made an estimate-and the details of his calculations are published-that at least ?75,000,000 worth of gold had been extracted from the reefs in prehistoric times. But fourteen years ago, and even eight years ago, the area of ancient gold- mining was far from being ascertained; the great bulk of the ancient mines were undiscovered, and it is very probable that this estimate was far exceeded. The late Prof. Sir Le Neve Foster and other mining experts claimed remote antiquity for the older type of mines. They pointed out the skill in mining engineering of the ancients; that they must have been experienced in their art of mining in their homeland; and that there was great similarity between mining in Rhodesia and ancient mining in the Near East. Every mining engineer in Rhodesia has spoken of the skill of the ancient miners as altogether beyond the capacity of any present native race. I believe the oldest ruins, and the mines particularly, represent the latest phase of a Semitic influence which existed in Rhodesia far back in remote times, possibly before the Christian era; and though it must be admitted that there are both ruins and gold-workings in Rhodesia which are only of post-mediaeval origin, I am not prepared to accept the theory of the purely Kafir origin of the whole of the monuments and mines in the country until further investigations have been made into the question of the gold-mines. Sir HARRY JOHNSTON: I have never been exactly to the part of Africa where these ruins are situated, but if my opinion is of any value, I should say my own convictions remain relatively unshaken that there was at a period at least as early as the birth of Christ-I believe earlier-an incursion into this country of a Semitic race of teachers. I cannot otherwise explain the gold-mining, the soapstone birds, the phalli, and the several other features in these remains which are so utterly unlike anything that has ever been made by any race of Bantu negroes. Neither is there evidence to show they could have been made by Hottentots. My own belief is that the presence in Africa, south of the Zambezi, of Bantu negroes is a relatively modern phase. The first violent eruption of the Zulus may have driven away the pre-Islamic Arabs, and yet not have completely caused the gold-mining to cease. It is, however, most useful to all of us that Mr. MacIlver should have made a searching inquiry and have put before us an alternative view. All his arguments oulght to be considered much more carefully than they can on this occasion, and not be hastily rejected. Still, I do not think his having found Nanking pottery in the foundations of one or more of these structures should induce us to give up too readily the belief that at some period of possibly more than two thousand years ago, Arabians, or people from the direction of Arabia, did make their way down the coast of Africa in the search for gold, and that they were in some way answerable for these buildings. Mr. SELOUS: As I had travelled and hunted for a number of years in Eastern Mashonaland before the country was opened up by the British South Africa Company, I had seen a number of walled towns and hut foundations made of well- fitted granite bricks, which the natives said had been put together by their ancestors. I did not see the great Zimbabwe until 1890, and, being no expert or archaeologist, I do not know how to explain the discovery there of phallic emblems and a soap- stone copper mould; but of one thing I am quite sure, and that is, that the building of walled towns and circular buildings, and the extraction of gold from quartz, did not come to a sudden end a long time ago, nor can I see any evidence that a highly cultured civilized people ever lived in that country, who were destroyed by the sudden incursion of a barbarous race. There is abundant evidence to show that in the countries of Makoni and Umtasa</page><page sequence="6">THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. 341 the ancestors of the present occupants of that part of Mashonaland were living in very well-built walled towns, and Makoni's people still make offerings to-day to the spirit of Chipadzi at a well-built zimbabwe, where he is said to be buried. Makoni is said to be the direct descendant of Chipadzi. In my opinion, it was the Zulu invasions of the early part of the last century which put a stop to the wall-building in Mashonaland, and which gradually drove the Mashonas out of their walled towns to seek refuge on the tops of the hills, and which also put an end to the extraction of gold from quartz. Early in the last century Mashonaland was invaded by a horde of Swazi Zulus, then by the Abagaza, a Zulu tribe under Manikos, and in 1840 by the Matabele, who came from the west. Many old Matabele men to whom I have spoken have told me that when they first invaded Mashonaland they found the natives working for gold in the "amaguti "-that is, in the deep holes, and in 1891 a bark bucket and a bark rope were found at the bottom of a shaft 120 feet deep, between the Umfuli and Umzweswe rivers. This rope and bucket could not have been very old, and lying with them were an ordinary Mashona axe and other implements. Moreover, as late as in 1870 Mr. Thomas Baines found the Mashonas near Lo Magondis still extracting gold from quartz. In 1882 I examined an old shaft near the Tati river in western Matabeleland, and found the roof in one place supported by seven poles made of mopani wood (the common wood of the country). I examined all these poles very carefully, and found that they all had the bark on them, and had all been chopped with the same small narrow-bladed axes that are used by the natives to-day. Near this old gold- working there used to be a very well-built circular wall, made of fitted granite stones, with a herring-bone pattern on one side of it. I am sure that the gold- working in this district was put a stop to by the Matabele invasion of 1840. I think, too, there is strong evidence that the natives who lived on the hill behind the Great Zimbabwe and everywhere else in Mashonaland lived in huts built of poles plastered with mud and thatched with dry grass. At the foot of the hill behind Zimbabwe there are two enormous holes in the ground, and these were undoubtedly the places from which the natives dug the clay used by them to plaster their huts and make their pottery, for close to any modern Mashona village, or close to the site of any abandoned town, you will always find a similar though smaller hole for the same purposes. I never myself could see any sign of a highly cultured, civilized race of people having lived at Zimbabwe or anywhere else in Mashonaland. I walked round the top of the wall of the Great Zimbabwe, and found that it varied in breadth from 6 feet to 13 feet, and I believe that the people who built it intended to construct a circular building, but as they only worked by eye without taking any measurements, they made it elliptical. Surely if they had any knowledge of a written character, they would have had inscriptions on the soapstone pillars embedded in the walls of the fortress on the hill above the Great Zimbabwe, but there were nothing but herring-bone and lozenge-shaped ornamenta- tions. I examined these, and nothing could have been more rude; there was not a single straight line in them. Any native could cut such patterns in wood or soft stone at the present time. Given a powerful chief in Mashonaland a hundred years ago, at a time when the natives were still accustomed to building walls of well-fitted granite stones, and I see no reason why such a chief could not have had such a building as the Great Zimbabwe put up. Mr. C. H. READ: My contribution to this discussion will be a very short one, seeing that I have not seen these ruins myself, but I have only seen, during recent years, sundry of the remains that have been dug from them. Some years ago Colonel Rhodes brought me divers objects which had been found under similar conditions to those described by Mr. MacIver. But with regard to these, I may say No. IV.--APRIL, 1906.] 2 A</page><page sequence="7">342 THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. nothing that was brought to me differed from what might have been made either by the existing or recently existing natives, except in cases where they were im- portations of a well-known date. That is to say, there was Arab pottery and Chinese porcelain, such as Mr. MacIver has found, but nothing dating from an earlier period than about the thirteenth century. Now, we know that Mr. MacIver has made systematic excavations on, I think I may say, sound archaeological lines. We have, therefore, relics which can be readily dated within a century, or even closer, no one of which (the imported articles) can be placed to a more remote date than, say, the thirteenth or twelfth century. The point before us is, are the ruins B.C., or do they belong to mediaeval times ? That is why there is no particular reason to bind one's self to the thirteenth century when it might be the fourteenth. With regard to one of the pieces of inscribed pottery shown on the screen, the writing upon it was dated, from the character of the script, as being about the fifteenth century. The character of the ware, however, would lead me to place it somewhat earlier, perhaps the thirteenth. They are the oldest importations to which any date can be given at all. All the Chinese porcelain is of a later date, it may be of the fifteenth or sixteenth century. Therefore we have these importations of a known date. As to the native objects, the assegais and so on, there is no need for me to speak about them here, because there are many gentlemen who know them far better than I do; but so far as I can see, there is nothing that might not well have belonged to the recent predecessors of an existing race in that part of Africa. Now we have these imported objects, which are more easily dated than native articles. We have them found in a definite position with regard to the construction of these ruins. As the foundations were made first, and these are part of the foundations, the super- structures, as Mr. Selous pointed out, must necessarily be subsequent to the date of the objects found in the foundations. That is really the kernel of the whole situation; that is the positive evidence. Now for the negative evidence. I have never heard of any series of ruins, spread over a wide extent of country like this, and assumed to have been erected by a civilized race, who have not left one single relic of any kind that is comparable with, let us say, the civilization of the Mediterranean area, or what is known of Arabia. There is not, so far as I have ever heard, one single object that can be set down as belonging to any civilization of any of these northern people at a period, say, before Christ. That is the negative evidence, and, taking the two together, one cannot set down these ruins as being erected by any civilized race from the north or at a period antecedent to the Christian era. Mr. H. BALFOUR: I do not think that I can add materially to this interesting discussion. My own opportunities for visiting the sites of the ruins in Rhodesia were very few. I was able to pay a brief visit to Khami, and I made a three-day stay at Umtali, spent principally at the ruins with Mr. Andrews. In comparing these two sites, I could not but be struck by their individuality, as exhibited both in their general characteristics and in certain points of detail. The presence, for example, at the Umtali ruins of numerous curiously engraved and otherwise deco- rated stones of large size, and the numerous finds of steatite figurines, furnish a striking feature which is not paralleled at other similar sites. The abundance of rude flint flakes and implements at some of the ruins, associated with the iron tools of native manufacture, and their scarcity on other sites, is another feature worthy of further investigation. I have recently (in Man, February, 1906) suggested an explanation for this, but further work is required. Although the various sites bear undoubtedly striking resemblances to one another, showing their certain relationship, yet the divergences are equally important, and I gather, from the descriptions of Mr. Maclver and others, that this individuality extends more or</page><page sequence="8">THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. 343 less over the range of the ruins. It is evident to me that it is of the greatest importance that renewed investigations should be undertaken, and that each individual site should be worked out as thoroughly as possible, before final generalizations are made upon the whole group. Personally I sympathize strongly with Mr. MacIver's conclusions, and I consider that the results which he has arrived at by unbiassed archaeological methods are conclusive as far as they go; but I still hold that there are yet important details requiring explanation, and on these grounds I think that it is extremely desirable that further work of a highly organized kind should be instituted. What we seem to require now is an organization somewhat similar to that of the Egypt Explora- tion Fund, which would enable the work to be conducted under the supervision of a highly qualified organizer, and to proceed during a period of years, until a sufficient amount of evidence has been obtained. The problem is none the less interesting for having been to some extent transferred from archaeology to ethnology, and it remains just as worthy of detailed investigation as before. Dr. HADDON: Mr. Maclver has not had time this evening to give us all the data he has collected. In Bulawayo he informed us he had seen a large number of buildings in which he could trace the gradual evolution of such a complicated building as that of Zimbabwe from a simple kraal. It seems to me that the whole of the evidence of the ruins should be considered, as all the remains are associated; it is unfortunate that Mr. Maclver's time was too short to enable him to study the gold-workings and what has been described as a chain of forts, but as his opportunity was limited, he wisely confined himself to the more important buildings. I heartily agree with Mr. Balfour that a society or association should be formed to examine the problem thoroughly in all its aspects. With regard to the phallic emblems obtained from the old ruins, I may state that I saw in a Makalanga hut a couple of clay breasts on the interior of the wall, showing that a magical practice connected -with reproduction is carried on at the present day. There is one question which perhaps Mr. Selous could answer. It is whether any local Bantu chief, or king, ever had sufficient power to organize labour of this kind ? I am perfectly aware a chief could organize warfare-fighting is a game most men like; but is it likely he could enforce the tremendous amount of hard work that was necessary to exploit the gold-mines ? Mr. SELOUS: Any Zulu chief could have commanded 10,000 men. Dr. HADDON: And make them work in the mines ? Mr. SELOUS-: Oh yes. Dr. HADDON: That seems to me an important point, because some one, a Maka- langa or other chief, must have had a considerable amount of power to do this, as well as to build the forts and keep open the trade routes. Mr. D. G. HOGARTH: I quite agree with Mr. Read, who is really the only speaker, so far, who has addressed himself to the subject from an archaeological point of view. The most important point in Mr. Maclver's paper, from an archaeologist's point of view, is the section which he cut at Zimbabwe. Mr. Hall said nothing about it. I should be glad if Mr. Maclver, in his reply, would be very precise and tell us whether it is certain that he actually found pottery under foundations, or whether he found it where these had been removed. Mr. MACIvER: Absolutely certain. Mr. HOGARTH: That is what I want to know, because on this pottery depends a very great deal. I would remind the meeting that if that lowest building in the elliptical "temple" goes, the elliptical "temple" goes with it, and the bottom is knocked out of the Semitic theory. It is on the elliptical temple that the whole Semitic theory centres. It rests also on a great deal of vague generalization. As 2 A 2</page><page sequence="9">344 THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. Mr. Read says, we have no other evidence of Arabians or Semites here, and it is not conceivable that these would have left no positive evidence of their presence. For instance, there is not a scrap of their writing. And there is another fact which I wished to mention at the Geographical Society some time ago, and that is this: A great deal has been said about South Arabian buildings in this con- nection, in spite of the fact that we practically know nothing about them. We have never had any published photographs of the Marib ruins. They were not even seen by Dr. D. H. Miiller, who has been quoted by Mr. Hall. He endeavoured to get there some years ago, but the party quarrelled, and he barely escaped with his life down to the coast. These buildings may or may not have an analogy with those Zimbabwe buildings, but in quoting them we have been dealing with an unknown factor all the way through. My own view about this problem, if it is worth anything, has been pretty definite for some years. I was not convinced by Mr. Bent's evidence. I was always very much impressed by two facts: one that:no real evidence of high civilization was offered, either by the architecture, or still more by the smaller finds, particularly those much-vaunted steatite phalli and birds. Of course, steatite is the easiest stone that is worked by man, and the work that was done in this at Zimbabwe was far below the present work of the inhabitants of New Guinea. I hope that the result of this meeting will be that more attention will be paid to definite archaeological evidence such as can be gained by scientific investigations; such evidence as I think, to a great extent-though I agree that the whole area has not been covered-has been gained by Mr. Maclver; and less attention be paid to assumptions in this matter. If you will read Mr. Bent's book and other works upon this question with care, you will see that the sanctity of the elliptical temple was always assumed at the start, and practically almost everything-every generalization which has been drawn about the things found in that curious and irregular area, rested upon this assump- tion. If I may add one other thing, I would ask Mr. Maclver, in his reply, to say whether he has any theory about the erect monoliths. I admit they may signify almost anything, but it is possible he may have formed some definite theory as to the purpose for which they were put there. Mr. J. L. MYRES: There is one point which I perhaps misunderstood, and I should be very glad if Mr. MacIlver in his reply would make it clear. He gives us in his paper evidence that the cement platforms come right up to the inside of the big walls of Zimbabw e and of these other buildings, and he mentions instances in which they come right up to the outside. The only weak point which I think the critic might conceivably find in that proof is as to the exact relations between the walls and their immediate foundations. Does one get anything to suggest that the earliest platforms inside and outside the wall really go back to the period of the walls themselves? He makes use of the analogy of water frozen into a glass or the molars in a jaw, but that does not prove anything about the relative age of the water and of the glass; so I am not quite clear that his proof of the age and composition of the cement deposits is complete. Mr. L. DONCASTER: I have no justification for addressing the meeting, except that I was at Zimbabwe after Mr. MacIver was there. I am not an archaeologist, but it did not seem to me to be certain that Mr. Maclver had got to the foundation of the outside walls at Zimbabwe. It seemed to me that the proof he gives that the structures inside the walls of Zimbabwe are comparatively modern need not necessarily apply to the walls themselves. I saw and examined the trench of which he gave a photograph. There is no doubt it goes under a small very badly built wall, and underneath that wall there is clay with ashes and pieces of charcoal, and teeth of oxen very well preserved and obviously fairly new. But it did not go under--</page><page sequence="10">THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. 345 Mr. MACIVER: Do you mean below the level, or do you mean passed underneath ? Mr. DONCASTER: Below the level; so far as I could see, the foundation was nowhere exposed. Mr. MAcIvER: I must correct you. That trench went underneath no wall; it was in Section 15, and ran north and south. Mr. DONCASTER : There was a little wall. Mr. MACIVER: Yes, but my trench did not run under that. I merely dug there to see what it was. It did not run underneath; it started at that point. Mr. DONCASTER: Yes, so that you can see the wall was built upon clay con- taining bones and teeth. Mr. MACIVER: The statement will pass. Mr. DONCASTER: It was not near the great wall outside. I saw no evidence that Mr. MacIver had exposed the foundations of the main wall. The CHAIRMAN: If no one else wishes to make any remarks, I will ask Mr. MacIver to reply shortly to the questions which have been raised. Mr. RANDALL MACIVER: The ground covered, of course, has been exceedingly wide, and it has been a very great relief to me to find in the last three speeches that one seemed at last to be getting to grips. I had wished from the start to have this discussion closer, and to be able to answer every objector one by one. As it is, we have acquired a great deal of useful information, but several of the speeches, much as I have learned from some of them, have shown a totally false conception of what is the logic of these things. It is, as Mr. Hogarth put it-and he has virtually answered the most important of my objectors-entirely an archeological question. I had hoped to be cross-examined about the sections and about my field work, and not to be assailed with vague generalizations about what might con- ceivably have happened under certain geographical conditions. I answered Mr. Hogarth, interpolating in his speech, that the decisive objects were found directly underneath the foundation of the huts, and not merely below their level. Mr. Myres' point is a valuable one. I am quite certain that the cement platforms belong to the walls. I used the analogy of water frozen into a glass, and that applies to a place like Dhlo Dhlo or Nanatali. The fitting is so exact that the cement must actually have been made to go into the stone. At Zimbabwe are still better examples, because there the cement goes outside as well as under the walls. Mr. Doncaster, of course, gets on to the same point: Had I got to the bottom of the walls? Yes, the section which I particularly referred to in the elliptical temple, the section in enclosure 15, was in the very lowest corner of the temple, and when I got down to bed-rock I could not get to anything else, and I was several feet below the main walls there. Taking my other objectors one by one, Prof. Gregory refers to the ingots. Well, that is a very small point. If Prof. Gregory knew his Portuguese authors, he would find there is a reference to natives making ingots in the form of a cross. As a matter of fact, this shape of ingot is found in various parts of the world, and has no doubt been adopted on account of its convenience for tying into loads. Prof. Keane maintains that the conical tower, the birds, and the phalli are not African, but Semitic. Mr. Hogarth has dealt with the matter of the birds; they are of extremely rough work. The suggestion that they have any Egyptian character is simply ludicrous. As to "phallic worship," authors have spoken exceedingly loosely about it, and have never defined what it means. If there is to be any sense in terms, you cannot describe as " phallic worship" anything in which an anthropomorphic deity is concerned. But it is to be observed that in any case the iites which most nearly approach to anything like phallic worship are found amongst native African peoples, viz. the Ewe-speaking tribes of the West</page><page sequence="11">346 THE RHODESIA RUINS: THEIR PROBABLE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. Coast. In which connection I may remark that the famous " zodiac " belongs to a class well known from the West Coast, and the bells found by Mr. Hall at Zimbabwe suggest the same provenance. Prof. Keane, when he mentions mis- quotations and misunderstandings, reminds me there is both a misquotation and a misunderstanding in his interesting book on the ' Gold of Ophir.' The reference is on p. 162. Referring to Bent's statement that he had found a bowl inscribed with certain characters, Prof. Keane reproduces five characters, and from the terms in which he writes, leaves the readers to suppose they were inscribed on Bent's bowl. But they are the letters of the proto-Arabian alphabet, and taken from the alphabet, and not from Bent's bowl. I would not have referred to it, but the misconception has found its way into other books, and this sort of evidence ought to be checked. There are seven mentions of ruins in the Portuguese chronicles. The Portuguese did not get very far into the country, and you can work out exactly how far they did get in. I have been through all the Portuguese chroniclers very carefully; they are to be found in Dr. Theal's ' Records of South-Eastern Africa.' There are two references to Zimbabwe, and it has apparently been overlooked that one of them settles absolutely that the buildings were inhabited in the sixteenth century, when the author wrote. The writer is De Goes, and the reference may be found in Theal, vol. 3, p. 109: "In other districts of the said plain there are other fortresses built in the same manner, in all of which the king has captains." The "king," as appears from the context, is the " king of Benomotapa." This is in agreement with what Mr. Selous was telling us. I have been taken severely to task for not dealing with the mines. I had not the slightest intention of doing so, because I knew that I could not obtain sufficient archaeological evidence from them. But there is a great deal on the subject to be found in the Portuguese writers, and it is of some interest. I have put together, in my report, some notes as to the actual output of gold. Of course it is exceedingly difficult to get any exact estimate of what has been extracted. Let us, for the sake of argument, take the suggestion which puts it at 75,000,000. A Portuguese writer (Alcacova) states the yearly sum being taken out at the very beginning of the sixteenth century. Translated into English money, it was somewhere between ?109,000 and ?140,000 sterling. It would not take many centuries to run up even to such a figure as 75,000,000 at that rate. I think I have nothing further to add, except to say that of course this is not a full account that I have been able to put before you. I have done my best to brirg a good deal of evidence before you in a short space of time, and I am exceedingly obliged to those gentlemen who have been so kind as to support my opinion, and not less obliged to those who, by opposing me, have brought fresh light to bear upon the subject. The CHAIRMAN (Sir THOMAS HOLDICH): I can only express my regret that for a discussion so interesting as this has been we had not a little more time. I think it might well have been extended over two meetings. I think the general sense of the meeting appears to be in support of Mr. MacIver's contention, but there have been such divergences of opinion expressed that I quite agree with what Mr. Balfour has said on the subject of further investigations on the lines he suggested. I can only say for myself that if ever such investigations can be carried out, I hope they may be collated with other investigations on the further side of Arabia, where there are, extending along the coast from Beluchistan to the Purali river, which in the time of Herodotus was called Arabis, a great number of ruins still awaiting research by the archbeologist, which I believe are due to the building capacity of the Himyaritic Arabs. At the present we have nothing more to do than to thank Mr. Maclver for giving us a most interesting address leading to a discussion which I think will be productive of further interest in the future.</page><page sequence="12">ANTHROPOGEOGRAPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN BRITISH NEW GUINEA. 347 Colonel H. W. FEILDEN, who was unable to attend, sends the following remarks on Mr. MacIver's paper: My personal acquaintance with the ruins of Rhodesia is confined to those of Khami, near Bulawayo. I visited them last year. These buildings do not seem to me beyond the intelligence of native African tribes to construct. At the same time, is it not hazardous to deny that those who built these "cities" were not influenced by an ingraft of a higher civilization from without ? Do we not possibly underrate the traffics and discoveries of the ancients, and the influence they may have exerted by contact with the barbarous inhabitants of South Africa ? But my object in joining in this discussion is to draw attention to facts which seem to have been overlooked, or touched on very lightly. The enormous debris mounds, covering many acres, surrounding the ruins of Khami, have been raised by a people largely using stone. Implements of stone, such as flakes and cores, are to be met with in thousands; in fact, hardly a stone I picked up, even on the surface of the debris mounds, failed to show the handiwork of man. This suggests that the inhabitants of Khami could not have been in a very forward condition of civilization. I do not suggest that the presence of a partially stone-using population neces- sarily entails remoteness in time for the building of Khami. I find without doubt that a stone-using people of Bushman-Hottentot character lived on the shores of Table bay and False bay at the time of the first occupation by the Dutch. In their kitchen middens, relics of European wares are mixed with the stone implements of the chase and of their daily use. These stone implements are Neolithic in type; so are those at Khami. There is a Palmeolithic and Neolithic period observable in the Stone Age of South Africa. I am not prepared as yet to draw a line of demarcation between these periods; probably they inosculate. A great lapse of time must have elapsed between the Palaeolithic race, which has left abundant traces of its workmanship in the high-level river gravels of the Zambezi valley, deposited before the Victoria falls and the chasms of that river were carved out, and the builders of Khami. I have ventured to draw attention to the stone-using character of the people who raised the debris mounds of Khami, in the hope that the future explorers of the ruins of Rhodesia may pay greater attention than has hitherto been done to this interesting and perhaps elucidating subject.
