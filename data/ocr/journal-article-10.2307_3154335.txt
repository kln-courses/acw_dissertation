<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL NOTES. "THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION."' J. FROM THE PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT. PRINCIPAL FAIRBAIRN'S teachings involve three considerations, viz., a philosophy, a philosophy of religion, a philosophy of the Christian religion. The treatment is cumulative, but the controlling factor is the author's philosophy. We shall, therefore, proceed to set forth this philosophy, to estimate its value, and to indicate its influence upon the remaining factors. I. Principal Fairbairn presents his readers, first, with a theory of knowledge; second, with a theory of action. The theory of knowledge resolves itself into three separable, though ultimately related, inquiries, viz.: How is knowledge as an affair of the individual mind, possible ? How is knowledge as a system of objective fact, possible ? How is the correspondence of subjective knowledge with objective fact, possible ? With reference to the first question, the author offers an argument as follows. The content of mind is originally a series of separate conscious states. In themselves these can give no knowledge, for knowledge involves a perception of their unity in relation. To illustrate, we may imagine the letters f, a, c, e, separately and without reference beyond themselves. Taken so, they mean nothing. If, however, we take them with reference to the alphabet, or as symbols united in a single whole, meaning emerges, knowledge is constituted. Subjectively considered, knowledge pre- supposes, therefore, the presence to these separate states of a synthetic principle which distinguishes itself from them and yet weaves them according to its own laws into that organized whole which constitutes the content of its concrete reality. Such a principle is permanent as opposed to the flux of the elements of content. As permanent, it is the pure ego or mind; as active upon its changing content, it is the concrete ego or personality. Personality, accordingly, is the presup- position of all knowing, subjectively considered. Furthermore, as each personality is on the one side (as permanent principle) out of 'A. M. FAIRBAIRN, The Philosophy of the Christian Religion.

Principal Fairbairn gives to the second question an answer similar to that made to the first. Nature as known is a cosmos of related objects. These objects, in themselves, cannot account for the perma- nent relationships or laws by which they are woven into a unified known whole. Once again we must presuppose the presence to every known fact of a principle other than the fact yet contained within it, a prin- ciple to which (because of its synthetic, permanent character) we can give no other name than that of "self" or "personality." This leads at once to the third question: How is the correspond- ence of subjective knowledge with objective fact possible ? Principal Fairbairn answers after this manner: Because of the identity of principle between the synthetic activity which is presupposed in finite knowledge and the synthetic principle which is presupposed in Nature as a system of objective fact. Just as men have commerce one with another because of a common nature, so also, because there is final identity between the principle which is the soul of man and that which is the reality of Nature, there can be such thing as knowledge. Moreover, the concrete difference between the two principles is a further possibility of knowledge. The Mind of man, although eternal in Nature, is infinite only in potentiality; the Mind presupposed in Nature is infinite in actuality; the soul of man develops in knowledge by reproducing, within its own experience, that system of fact which is the experience of the eternally complete and perfect Mind. Principal Fairbairn builds his theory of action immediately upon his theory of knowledge. He proceeds by emphasizing the contrast between Mind and its content of objective known fact, while at the same time he emphasizes the identity between Mind and the principle which objective fact implies. Objective fact or Nature is ruled by uni- versal and inviolable laws. Antecedent and consequent are bound together by inexorable causal principles. Facts, in their movements, ask no questions; they perceive no alternatives; they simply go. Were it otherwise, science would be impossible. That universal and necessary causal laws are inseparable from science and from a Nature which is a system, Hume demonstrated for all time, although he could not explain on his system how such a presupposition is made good. But, if Nature is governed by inviolable mechanical laws, it is impos-</page><page sequence="3">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 93 sible that the mind of man can be considered as a product of Nature. Man, as we know him, is a moral being, one to whom the construction of alternatives and the self-direction of conduct are fundamental attributes of his being. There would thus appear to be an irrecon- cilable yet necessary dualism between the Mind of man and Nature. On the one hand Nature knows only mechanical laws; on the other, morality demands freedom, self-determination. The difficulty is removed only when we recognize the spiritual principle which is the soul both of Nature and of man. Mechanical laws may account for the order of natural events and for the content of human knowledge, but mechanical Nature itself rests in a spiritual unity, in and through which it is and whose free nature accounts for its (Nature's) mechanical laws. If, then, the Mind of man in its essential principle be not an event among events, but an existence not of the natural order, we are free to predicate of it the freedom and creative character which mor- ality demands. But the theory of knowledge has shown that knowl- edge is possible only because of the presence to and action upon the phenomenal content of consciousness of a non-temporal principle. Morality rests, therefore, upon a metaphysical and not upon a scien- tific basis; freedom is an attribute of the eternal spiritual essence of man. There is, therefore, that in man as his essential being, of which no temporal scientific account can be given, an aspect of his nature not evolved from lower forms. Here epistemology and psychology meet, for the added factor which an adequate theory of knowledge demands, accounts for the mental residuum which remains to every attempt at resolving the human mind into a product of lower forms. However much plain fact may enforce the similarity of structure between human and related subhuman forms, attention to fact also enforces upon us the unbridgeable gap, mentally, between the human and the subhuman. Furthermore, in this supernatural character of the Mind of man is to be found the origin of that ideal which as the expression of his essential being should guide and regulate his con- duct. Because of the creative potency of man's soul, the ideal arises as the expression of his reasonable best course of action; because of his affinity with the eternal, creative principle implied in the order of Nature the ideal is eternally progressive. Hence out of the super- natural character of man and out of his relation to an infinite super- natural spirit like unto himself arise, on the one hand morality, and on the other religion. Adequate theories of knowledge and of action, therefore, alike</page><page sequence="4">94 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY demand the recognition of a supernatural, personal agency both in the experience of mankind and in the system of Nature. Science, morality, and religion are brought into intelligible and harmonious relations. To science, with its mechanical laws, is given the entire field of the phenomenal; to morality, the entire field of active human experience; to religion, human experience in its wholeness as this is guided and directed by the recognition of that infinite spirit of which the human spirit is the reproduction, and Nature the vehicle. Person- ality is thus the final word of philosophy. In estimating the value of Principal Fairbairn's philosophy, three lines of argument will be followed: (i) Certain metaphysical difficulties will be indicated; (2) certain fundamental scientific errors will be pointed out; (3) an attempt will be made at a more adequate theory of knowl- edge and of action. i. The metaphysical difficulties of Principal Fairbairn's philosophy are essentially those of the system of Professor T. H. Green, by whom he has evidently been deeply influenced. (a) If the infinite Personality is from eternity the actuality of all that the finite has the potentiality of becoming, several stumbling- blocks appear in the path of logical procedure. First: How are we to conceive Nature? If it be taken as the content of Divine experience, and that experience is one eternally complete and realized, there would appear to be no room for change. The world of phenomena - events coming to be and passing away- disappears, and we are left with a rounded and completed system of static facts. If answer be made that the Divine is a completely realized but active personality, and that in successive moments He recreates identical experiences, two difficul- ties face us. While such a theory might account for change it would not account for evolution. Again, eternal repetition of identical events would soon destroy the Divine self-consciousness, if what we know of mental life be worth anything. Again, if Nature be taken as a system which reproduces, but is not the Divine experience, we become curious at once and wonder what possible value such a secondary world can have and how it is to be conceived. Value it can have none, for that value has already been given in the primary experience. Conceivable it is not, for if the Divine experience is Reality and is completely real- ized, there can be no room within the Real for the reproduction. " Com- plete realization" and "reproduction" as applied to ultimate Reality are essentially contradictory terms. Second: What is the character of Matter, and how is it related ultimately to Mind ? Principal Fairbairn</page><page sequence="5">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 95 draws such a sharp line of distinction between the mental and the mate- rial in his treatment of the origin of the finite mind that, if matter be admitted to have any ultimate reality, he must find himself at last with an irreducible dualism on his hands. This consequence Principal Fairbairn seeks to avoid by indicating that, although Matter with its mechanical principles can never be the explanation of Mind, yet Mind may be the explanation of Matter. But we ask: What function (accord- ing to Principal Fairbairn) is exercised by Mind both in knowledge and in Nature ? The answer comes that Mind is a relating, systematizing, organizing activity. If, therefore, Mind is to explain Matter, the latter must ultimately be analyzable into relations. However, as critics have pointed out and as Principal Fairbairn himself admits, relations without terms are unthinkable. Matter would thus appear to remain ultimately as the terms which actualize mental relations. As Kant pointed out long ago, such an argument as that pursued by Principal Fairbairn may serve to explain the unity of knowledge or the system of Nature, but leaves forever unresolved the stuff of both. (b) If personality be essentially a principle of synthesis, it is difficult, nay impossible, to see how it can be an absolute principle. If it is conceded that terms unrelated have no meaning, it must also be con- ceded that relations without terms are unthinkable. Synthesis, in short, presupposes material to synthesize. Again, such a good Hegelian as Principal Fairbairn should be the first to admit that unity without differ- ences is no unity at all. Therefore, if synthesis be necessary to knowl- edge, terms are also necessary to synthesis. If a spiritual unity be necessary to systematize Nature, Nature (as difference) is equally neces- sary to render Spirit an essential unity. Were it otherwise, Spirit would at once resolve itself into a blank and meaningless identity. In brief, Principal Fairbairn's spiritual activity, whether merely potential or completely realized, is a system of universals, and as such has no mean- ing when taken apart from the particulars organized. Such a result, however, sets organizing activity and organized material over against each other as correlative realities. In other words, Mind presupposes Matter as thoroughly as Matter presupposes Mind. But to admit this is to deny the absolute reality of personality, if we identify it with mental synthesis. (c) If the absolute be an eternal Personality (in Principal Fair- bairn's sense) there would seem to be no place for finite personality or for moral agency. In avoiding one difficulty, the author runs head- long into another and graver difficulty. Freedom is vindicated by tak.-</page><page sequence="6">96 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY ing the synthetic activity present in the knowledge and action of man, out of the temporal succession of events and placing it in the eternal system. But what is this activity when once it has been called eternal, and how does it "reproduce " the eternal Spirit ? Is not this contradic- tion ? If the Spirit in man be eternal, how distinguish it from the absolute Spirit ? If it be a "potential Spirit," how free it in origin (as a reproduction) and in development from the mechanical limitations of temporal succession ? On either basis morality vanishes. If the Spirit in man be Divine, there is no action of "mine" or "thine;" all is immediately and directly God's. If the Spirit of man be a "reproduc- tion," then either words mean nothing or we have not escaped the toils of mechanism, (d) If knowledge be a reproduction within the finite mind of the eternal verities of the Absolute, how concretely can we tell when our thought " corresponds " with Reality ? Apparently Principal Fairbairn takes for granted, as do also many other thinkers influenced by Pro- fessor Green, that Reality is reached and "correspondence" assured when we have developed the "universal" in our experience. Absurd as the question may appear to some minds, we must ask: "What is meant by this universal, and how do we know it when we get it ?" Every universal is an abstraction, and the process of thought by which it is reached involves a substitution. Now, abstractions are of all kinds, and substitution has a varying value. What, then, is the token by which we may know a real and universal abstraction when we have made it ? A mere reference to correspondence will not do, for by hypothesis the reproducing knowledge is not the reproduced Reality. Principal Fairbairn's metaphysic would thus appear to be unwork- able. With all its plausibility it is satisfactory neither to science, to morality, nor to religion. 2. (a) Principal Fairbairn's metaphysical position rests upon a fundamental psychological fallacy. He assumes a series of separate conscious states empirically given, i. e., the work of Nature. Before these can be transformed into unities which have meaning they must pass through a synthetic medium. Inasmuch as the author assumes conscious states which are separate one from another, his combining agency must appear as an activity other than the states themselves. Furthermore, inasmuch as the given mental states come and go in succession, the combining principle must appear as non-temporal. Principal Fairbairn's entire argument rests, therefore, upon his placing of the synthetic factor in knowledge. That such a synthetic factor is</page><page sequence="7">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 97 present in and is necessary to knowledge cannot be denied. It will ever remain the glory of the followers of Kant that they have made the overlooking of such a factor an impossibility. Admitting the necessity of synthesis, we may, however, be led to other conclusions than those of Principal Fairbairn. Since Professor James wrote his memorable chapter upon "The Stream of Consciousness," psycholo- gists have come to recognize that the assumption of original separate elements as the datum of mental content is a mistake. From its first appearance consciousness is a unity. In its process of development the factors of analysis and of synthesis appear. In their operation they give rise to discrimination of content and to the recognition of mean- ing. Both operations, however, fall inside the movement of the stream of consciousness itself. Hence the real gain of the Kantians can be conserved without the necessity of calling to our aid any metaphy- sical non-temporal activity. When this point has once been recog- nized, strict considerations forbid breaking Mind up into existentially distinct, empirical and transcendental factors. The time has come to recognize that empiricists and transcendentalists were alike in error in setting up separate mental elements. A psychology more true to fact recognizes the movement of analytic and synthetic processes with all that they imply-but as processes which occur within the concrete whole, which, taken in its wholeness, is the concrete personality of every man. (b) Principal Fairbairn also fails to recognize another fundamental principle of contemporary psychology, viz.: "Every mental process is correlated with a physical process." However we may ultimately interpret the relations of mind and body, the absolute correlativity of mental and physical states has been so thoroughly demonstrated by physiological psychology as to be regarded as axiomatic. For reasons mentioned in the immediately preceding section, it is impos- sible to maintain from the transcendentalist's point of view that the argument touches the content but not the essential principle of mind. The separation between synthetic unity and analytic elements we found to be an error. Mind is not a union of two different kinds of material; it is a single thing and must be treated as such. Moreover, all that we know of pathological states goes to show that the Ego undergoes transformation in abnormal conditions just as certainly as any empirical content. If, then, body and mind be thus intimately bound up together, it would seem impossible to admit the evolution of one and to claim for the other a mysterious supernatural origin.</page><page sequence="8">98 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY 3. We now come to a more serious undertaking. It has been shown that the metaphysic of Principal Fairbairn is involved in hopeless con- tradictions. These may be traced to inadequate theories of knowledge and of action. It remains therefore to indicate the lines upon which more satisfactory theories may be laid down. The primary error of Green, Fairbairn, and their followers, is that they hypostatize the idea function. And by this I mean that they regard ideas as the reproducing vehicles of a Reality whose nature can finally be stated in terms of ideas. Knowledge resolves itself into the means by which ideas are constructed in correspondence with the Reality known through them. Hence to these theorists Reality finally discloses itself as an all-comprehensive active meaning - a meaning permanent, eternal, complete. To this various terms may be given, but in the end there is no disguising the fact that on such a basis Reality must be described as an all-inclusive concept, finally, absolutely articulated. As already indicated, such a doctrine gives rise to diffi- culties. If the Real be finally stated in terms of knowledge, it presents us with an abstract and not a concrete world; a static system instead of one that is dynamic; a universe so complete and final that there would appear to be no rational place for the finite world which repro- duces it. Then as to truth and falsity, we lack a concrete criterion for testing our ideas as we construct them. Furthermore, if the con- tention be strictly carried through that ideas are true or false accord- ing as they do or do not " correspond " with the Real, we find ourselves in difficulties. Either truth is relative and we accept what we take to be partial correspondences for truth, or we can never know truth until we see each idea in its final relation to the completed system of Reality. In either case truth is far from us, for a truth which changes with every new construction is no truth and the Eternal is infinitely beyond us. In every sense, therefore, a "correspondence " or "representative" theory of knowledge is inadequate. Moreover, it points to the fact that every attempt to take the knowledge function as an end and not as a means is doomed to failure. The correction of this initial error is the attempt made by what is known as the functional theory of knowledge. It maintains that the work of knowledge is the con- struction and use of ideas. Instead, however, of regarding ideas as limits to knowledge, this theory goes deeper and finds in the move- ment of ideas a different significance. Analysis of ideas exhibits their practical origin and function. On the one hand every idea is</page><page sequence="9">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 99 an anticipation of possible experiences, and on the other a statement of the conditions by which the aforesaid anticipations may be realized. In other words, ideas are means to the directing, controlling, and elaborating of our experiences. Here there is no question of "corre- spondence " or "non-correspondence " of our ideas with Reality. Reality is with us in every experience, and the only question of the real and the unreal is: Have we the conception which will enable us to control, to manipulate it ? Truth and falsity are thus matters practical and near at hand. Can we realize our conceptions ? Then the reality in question is what we took it to be, and we have attained to a true con- ception. Do we fail of our anticipations ? Then our conception of conditions and of anticipations in their relation to each other was false and we must begin again. Does knowledge come short ? We are made aware of this by failures in action. Certain projected courses of conduct cannot be carried out; difficulties bar our path; we turn back and go to work again until the failure has been resolved into manageable conditions. When we have gotten hold of the diffi- culty, we see what to do and how to do it. Action is restored, knowl- edge in constituted. Such a theory, aside from the fact that it is founded in a direct analysis of the knowledge function and carries its criterion within itself, has this added mark of truthfulness, viz., it is a statement of the method both of science and of concrete living. To the scientist ideas are constructive agencies. He values them for what he can do with them. To him truth and falsity are determined experimentally. The scientist measures his conceptions universally by their working power. His one demand of conceptions is: "Do they give results ?" His ideal of knowledge is that of reducing his world to a system of antici- pations which can be accurately defined and to a system of conditions which can be as accurately measured. In ordinary life we proceed after the same manner. From childhood onward we define " what" anything is in terms of its "why" and "how." Examination of these terms shows that by the " why " of anything we mean the practical end which it serves, the experiences which we anticipate in connection with it, while by the "how" we mean the means by which the end is brought about, the conditions according to which our anticipations must be governed. The metaphysical implications of the functional theory of knowl- edge, pertinent to the present discussion, may now be stated. (a) Knowledge never furnishes us with entities. Hypostatization</page><page sequence="10">I 00 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY is far from it. Its business is to abstract, to determine, to categorize, but by so doing to control, to regulate, to concrete. The more com- pletely it is developed, the more accurate'and extensive are the instru- ments which are placed in our hands for the regulation of life and for the intelligent interpretation of the various experiences which are ours. Metaphysic must consequently confine itself strictly to the organization of the ideas which science furnishes us. (b) Knowledge and action cannot be separated the one from the other. They are but phases of a single process. Knowledge provides the means of action, whereas action is the touchstone of knowledge. (c) The self is not to be considered as a reality which lies out- side knowledge, but as the vehicle or medium of all knowledge. It is active experiencing itself, brought to consciousness of its own nature and meaning. II. Principal Fairbairn's position with reference to the philo- sophy of religion may be stated briefly. As one might expect, the dis- tinction between the eternal and the temporal, which appeared to be so fruitful in the author's theory of knowledge, is made use of to explain the permanent and the changing aspects of religion. However reli- gions may change according to historical circumstances and to location, they are fundamentally at one, in that they recognize implicitly or explicitly an essential relation between the soul of man and the eternal spiritual reality. For this reason, although the natural growth of religions furnishes us with a description of the process in time by which the idea of religion has been universalized and brought to con- sciousness, such growth is not an adequate explanation of the idea of religion itself. Religion is supernatural and is grounded in the im- pulse of the spiritual principle, which is man, to seek the realization of its infinite potentialities by the reproduction in its own nature of those activities which are eternally actual and infinite in the divine. In this we have the explanation of the fact that religion is the fundamental institution of society and that it must realize itself through the pro- gressive development of the ideals of mankind. A point of attack upon Principal Fairbairn's conception is not far to seek. Inasmuch as we found it impossible to admit a distinction between an eternal and a temporal factor in the mind of man, but were led to consider it as an organic progressive unity, we are compelled, in considering the institutions of mankind, to set aside every attempt at separating form from content and must investigate religion entirely in its historical sense. In this position we are further confirmed by the</page><page sequence="11">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 10 1 results of our theory of knowledge. Every true idea is objective and leads us to the deeper appreciation and experience of Reality, but it in no way pretends to define for us an ultimate and fixed Reality. In other words, it is not the business of idea to take us away from life to some Reality beyond, but rather to bring us closer to life and to a deeper appreciation of that reality which is in all life. Philosophy, therefore, can never be anything more than systematized science, for science is the workshop of ideas. But, on the other hand, science does no more than bring to light, to organize and to test the varied realities which life differentiates. And the point here pertinent to the present discussion is, that the philosophy of religion must systematize the results of the science of religion, as this sets before us the outcome of investigation into what religion in the past and in the present has contributed to the life of man. In every stage of investigation the final question of truth and reality with religion as with everything else is: What form of life does it pretend to organize? What conditions does it make use of ? Does it accomplish its aims ? What we require from the exponents of religion today is an understanding of the methods and processes of religion in the past, of the success of its methods as measured by the standards of its own times, of the charac- ter of its methods and processes today, together with a setting forth of the way in which it enters into and rationally organizes that life. III. Principal Fairbairn evaluates religions according as they set free and universalize the transcendental ideas immanent in them. To his mind Christianity has accomplished this labor in a unique and final sense. Its success further has been accomplished not so much by the life and teaching of its founder as by the doctrine of His nature and mission which His personality set free. Here again the author's argument rests upon his untenable meta- physic. For this reason his Christian apologetic must be set aside. The cumulative result of the volume is therefore, as regards its specific aim, nothing. Such must be the result of every attempt to organize facts on the basis of conceptions which, whatever their history, have given way to more workable methods. In conclusion the writer would suggest that Principal Fairbairn threw away his opportunity by neg- lecting the life and teachings of Jesus. Whether these be unique or not, the question which rises in the mind of the thinking man today is: What has the Christian religion as a life to give me ? How is it to be made rationally effective in and for this work-a-day world of ours? In other words: How are vitality and naturalness to be given</page><page sequence="12">102 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY to that institution which has lost its hold upon the lives and minds of a large and increasing number of intelligent men ? S. F. MACLENNAN. OBERLIN COLLEGE, Oberlin, O. II. FROM THE THEOLOGICAL STANDPOINT. THIS work is the outcome of its author's visit to India as Haskell lecturer, where he suddenly found himself face to face with a religion he had studied in its literature and by the help of interpreters of many minds and tongues, and this contact with reality at once perplexed and illuminated him. .... Hence he was confronted with certain philosophical problems which he had to attempt to solve before he could think of undertaking any large historical investigation. These problems created this book, "for they compelled the author to study his own faith in their light." He could not but feel that Christianity stood among the religions which must be historically investigated and philosophically construed; and that no greater injury could be done to it than to claim for it exceptional consider- ation at the hands of the historical student or philosophical thinker. (Pref- ace, p. ix.) . . . . This book is then neither a philosophy nor a history of religion, but it is an endeavor to look at what is at once the central fact and idea of the Christian faith by a mind whose chief labor in life has been to make an attempt at such a philosophy through such a history. (Preface, pp. ix, x.) This central fact and idea is Christ, "not Jesus of Nazareth," but the deified Christ, and the principle is further expressed thus: The conception of Christ stands related to history as the idea of God is related to nature, i. e., each is in its own sphere the factor of order, or the constitutive condition of a rational system. The study of nature has been the means of unfolding, explicating, and defining the contents of the idea of God; the study of history has developed, amplified and justified the concep- tion of Christ. (P. I8.) It is the deified Christ who has been believed, loved, obeyed, as the Savior of the world. The act or process of apotheosis, then, created the Christian religion; and who was responsible for it ? If the imaginative peasants of Galilee, they were doing a deed no less wonderful than the creation of the world, and the power or providence which allowed them to do it was consenting by fiction and make-believe to govern reason and form character. (P. IS.) The deification-if we may call it so, though the term is radically incorrect -has all the effect of the most finely calcu-</page><page sequence="13">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 103 lated purpose formed after all the needs of man and the whole course of his history have been considered. There is nothing in nature nor in art that can so well illustrate design or adaptation to an end. And, though it be illusory, yet it works, not as illusion, but as truth, and for it, in a most miraculous way; true men receive it, are made truer by it, so use it as to build the world up in the love and pursuit of the truth as it had never been built up before. (P. x4.) Then follows the conclusion: But what kind of reflection is it upon the Maker and Master of the universe, if we conceive him as consenting to this thing ? Nay, in what sort of light does it set reason if we imagine it capable of being so deluded and deceived, seduced to martyrdom or compelled to enthusiasm by a mistake ? Indeed, if the doctrine of the person of Christ were explicable as the mere mythical apotheosis of Jesus of Nazareth, it would become the most insolent and fateful anomaly in history. (P. I5.) In these quotations we find the purpose, the theme, and the method of the book. Its purpose is the reassuring of the author's mind, the theme is the Logos conception as essential Christianity, and the method is rhetorical assertion and questionings. Thus the book belongs to apologetics only in the narrowest sense. It attempts not to convince the unbelieving, but to comfort the faith- ful. The need for such works is apparent, for it is not only Principal Fairbairn who has found his faith disturbed by contact with world-wide problems. Many men ask with him: "What is religion in general ? How and why has it arisen ? What causes have made religions to differ ? . . . . Can a religion whose institutions are at once local and essential be universal ?" (P. viii.) Accustomed to hold our faith as divinely imparted and the ethnic religions as man's blind gropings after God, the situation forced upon the Christian world is grave beyond question. Add to this the problems of modern philosophy and science, and we may well look eagerly for the line of thought which shall reconcile traditional faith with present knowledge. Dr. Fairbairn's treatise meets wide approval, and doubtless it will help to sustain the faith of many. Manifestly its author regards its line of argument as triumphant, but it is characteristic of our age that no apologetic can long satisfy even the defenders of the faith which does not attempt at least to meet doubt upon its own ground, which is not purposed to win men who have lost their faith. The main points at issue must be frankly stated and fairly met, if Christianity is to regain its old position of intellectual supremacy. The world of modern philosophy and science will not so much as consider seriously our</page><page sequence="14">104 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY author's argument, notwithstanding its wide learning, its often acute reasonings, and its confident tone, and we have the separation made only the more apparent, an argument deemed cogent on the one side and unworthy a thorough review on the other. The oratorical manner is far removed from the calm of scientific discourse. For example, consider the following passage delivered in the presence of men who, really impressed by the spirit of the age, are already separated from the Christian faith: But suppose we abandon all logical reservations and make a present of the conception of matter to the venturesome thinker who would deduce from it the nature we know, are his difficulties ended ? Nay, they are only about to begin. He is at once faced by the questions: When and why did the creative process commence ? What moved the atoms toward their miracul- ous work ? What had they been about before ? Why did they begin then ? Why not earlier? Why not later ? Matter on this hypothesis has always been: it is eternal, it is indestructible, and in its existence that of its prop- erties is involved. Now, however far back the primary movement is carried, eternity lies beyond it. Why in that eternity did not the eternal matter work itself into a world ? Why at this specific moment was it started on its creative career ? (P. 53) Would not our listener say: "This is the old list of queries hurled so often by the atheist against the theist with the change of God to matter and he to it. It has as much or as little cogency in the one case as in the other. Science is not concerned with questions which apply to all attempts to conceive eternity under time-forms, and the action of the infinite in terms of the finite. Nor are we ready to accept Dr. Fairbairn's implied alternative: "Answer my hard ques- tions or accept my philosophy." This oratorical and belligerent form not only repels him we should wish to convince, and not merely leads the believer astray by making him suppose that the response of his feelings to an appeal is the answer of his intelligence to an argument; but it conceals from the writer himself the points at issue. Two lines of religious thought contend for the mastery. Tiele named them "theocratic" and "theanthropic," the transcendent God who from without rules man, and the immanent God who within man constitutes the deepest reality. The first is best set forth in Semitic religions, the second in Aryan. Can the two be harmonized ? In the first centuries of the church the two lines came in contact, and through the mediation of the Logos doctrine were reconciled, the doctrine of the Trinity being the completed statement. In our own day the con-</page><page sequence="15">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" o05 flict of theology with philosophy, and with science in so far as it is a theory of the universe, involves similar lines of thinking. But the situation is not the same. The Greek philosophy, in spite of resem- blances, is far other than our modern monism, and the Nicene and early Greek Fathers were without the modern scientific conceptions of the world and of history. Their problems were not our problems, and if we make their solutions our own, it can be only by importing meanings which originally did not belong to them. So the question arises again: Can we accept the anthropomorphic God of the Hebrew Scriptures and at the same time hold the modern philosophic and scientific view of the world ? Dr. Fairbairn, notwithstanding his knowledge of historical facts, fails to show the historic spirit, but confuses the different periods and problems. After showing the differences which lie on the surface between the Jesus of the evangelists and the Christ of the creeds, he writes : But now what precisely is this double argument of rational logic and analytical criticism worth? Is it not cogent simply because it is narrow? ...0 . The dexterous logician is not the only strong intellect which has tried to handle the doctrine. The contradictions which he translates into rational incredibilities must either have escaped the analysis of men like Augustine or Aquinas, or have been by their thought transcended and recon- ciled in some higher synthesis. It is a wholesome thing to remember that the men who elaborated our theologies were at least as rational as their critics, and that we owe it to historical truth to look at their beliefs with their eyes. (P. 13.) But as we look at their beliefs with their eyes, we know that their beliefs differ from our beliefs, though called by the same names, that their problems are not our problems, and that their conclusions, how- ever venerable, cannot be final authority for us, nor prevent our attempting to study for ourselves as they studied for themselves. This inability to put himself in the historic attitude affects the main propo- sition of our author and his forms of proof. The main proposition, as we have seen, is this, that Christ is in history as God is in nature, that is, as its principle of order. So the book falls into two parts, one discussing God in nature, the other Christ in history. Now, as it is the divine Christ who is thus the principle of history, so it is the transcendental, the noumenal, God who is the principal of nature. The real nature which needs to be explained is not the phenomenal, but the noumenal; not the world which appears to reason, but the reason which</page><page sequence="16">o06 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY organizes, into an intelligible whole, the world of appearances, making it real to experience through its reality to thought. (P. 38.) . . . . The transcendental in philosophy is the correlate of the supernatural in theology. The former uses abstract speech, the latter employs concrete terms; but it is only when the abstract becomes concrete that it receives application and reality. We are thus thrust into the heart of the modern problem of philosophy, and one is led at the start to expect its discussion. For after a little preliminary play with Hume, the author describes briefly how the mind forms its world, and how the world does not explain the mind, but the mind the world. One would suppose a study of Kant in this passage (pp. 30 ff.), but suddenly we jump Kant's great gulf and arrive with startling rapidity at our conclusion that the noumenon of the universe is a personal God. But man, as Dr. Fair- bairn points out, weaves his world out of the appearances which are given him. Without these phenomena he knows nothing. How then does he argue from the world formed by his intelligence to the reality which forms his intelligence, from the phenomena which constitute his world to the reality beyond and behind all appearances ? How does man, whose world is in time and space forms supplied by his own intelligence, argue thence to the eternal which is timeless, and to the omnipresent which is spaceless; from his own intelligence relative and conditioned to an all embracing consciousness, absolute and uncon- ditioned? The questions belong to the problem as our author states it, but he ignores them and argues for his immanent, noumenal Nature on lines laid down in the past by men who strove to prove the existence of the supernatural, manlike God, above and beside His little world, the theocratic God whom Dr. Fairbairn denies. The same difficulty emerges and remains without discussion in the second part of the book: The supernatural is not identical with the extraordinary, the abnormal, nor the miraculous: nor is the natural synonymous with the regular, the orderly, or the uniform. Each may be said to be the other under a changed aspect. (P. 307.) Here we recognize a God like Pfleiderer's, a pan-en-theism. But later the gospel miracles are accepted in the usual sense, and Jesus is described as dealing with nature precisely as the most realistic theologian might describe him as doing. For it is characteristic of our author that Pfleiderer's problem is left unmentioned and undis-</page><page sequence="17">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" 107 cussed. How, then, can He who is Causa causarum be also a particu- lar cause among particular causes ? Consider another instance: Repeatedly the argument is from the nature of the effect to the nature of the cause: Now one thing is evident: the more severely natural the process is, the less we can allow anything to emerge in its course which is not really con- tained within the terms of the nature which inaugurated the process, forms the bosom within which it proceeds and the energies which move it onward. What nature evolves, nature must have involved; and to emphasize as natural both the process that leads to the end and the end to which it leads is to bind ourselves to find in the primary or causal term of the process the sufficient reason for all that follows. (P. 40.) Here is the ancient notion of causation, a chain which leads back to its first term, with effect and cause alike. But modern science dis- cards the notion. Causation is not so much a chain as a network with every term cause and effect at once, and the effect is by no means like the primary or like any term of the process. The book supplies an illustration: "Just as his organism lives within and through its envi- ronment, absorbing into itself the elements without that are needful to growth and health within." (P. 84.) Thus man's physical structure is formed by this combination; is the effect, we may say, of the organ- ism, of the elements absorbed, and of the environment within and through which it lives. Neither organism in this sense, nor elements absorbed, nor environment is the cause of his physical structure, but all combined, with others the subtlest science cannot discover nor the most untiring unravel. But none is like the effect, nor are all of them. No prophetic eye from these causes could foresee him, nor could any careful reasoner from effect to cause find his type in any of the elements which make his being. But if this be so, and we take it science has no question here, we find it difficult to argue without more ado from effect to cause, and assert that because man knows, his cause must be a knower, or because he is moral, his cause must be righteous. To say that what nature evolves must first have been involved and then to argue to God as cause is to fail to convince because it conceals the issue by an epigram. The main proposition disappoints us likewise in its definition and discussion. It is the conception of the divine Christ, formed by the disciples and perfected by the church, which has wrought so power- fully in history. But, since the phrase "divine Christ" may conceal divergent meanings, we ask for further light. Dr. Fairbairn inter-</page><page sequence="18">io8 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY prets it in terms of the Logos; it is the "factor of order" in history. Now, whatever we may think of this description of the "deified Christ," we shall agree, I fancy, in the proposition that it is not this conception which has created our religion. Here is the final illustra- tion of Dr. Fairbairn's failure to understand and interpret history. According to him the disciples created the Christian religion through their interpretation of the person of our Lord, and this interpretation, and not the historic Jesus, has had "all the effect of the most finely calculated purpose formed after all the needs of man and the whole course of his history have been considered." (P. 14.) But again we ask: What conception of the Christ has wrought so powerfully ? Dr. Fairbairn rejects the notion of a legal atonement and the sacra- mentarian conception. But, may we not modestly suggest, it is these ideas and what they involve, and not the Logos conception, which have been really most influential in the ages past. Without them we may well wonder what would have been the course of Christian history. But if, say, sacramentarianism with all its results be not accepted as true, is reason discredited and may we even exclaim, "What kind of reflection is it upon the Maker and Master of the uni- verse if we consider him as consenting to this thing ? Nay, in what sort of light does it set reason, if we imagine it capable of being so deluded and deceived, seduced to martyrdom or compelled to enthu- siasm by a mistake ?" It is only by bringing the most heterogeneous notions together under a single term that a semblance of reality can be given to Dr. Fairbairn's claim, and his philosophy of the Logos has had the smallest share in the total result. Surely the want of the scientific spirit as of its method is apparent in these sentences we have twice quoted. For by its method we can " prove" anything. Buddhism, accord- ing to Dr. Fairbairn, was created by the fanciful apotheosis of Gautama; but within the circle of its believers why should we not argue for its truth, else would this be "the most fateful anomaly in history" ? Where may we draw the line between this charge against God and reason, and the possession of absolute truth by man ? Science, on the contrary, admits that its own truth which seems fairest and works most wonderful results may be inadequate in statement, erroneous in gener- alizations, or temporary in its value. The development of knowledge implies nothing less, and nowhere can we lay hand upon the proposi- tion which if disproved shall carry with its fall the temple reason raises to truth, crushing at once God and reason in its fall.</page><page sequence="19">FAIRBAIRN'S "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION" Io09 That Christ is the principle of order in history is a proposition of high importance, if true, to science and philosophy. Since many philosophies of history strive for mastery, each with its array of facts, here surely we may ask for scientific proof. But Dr. Fairbairn fails us utterly. Instead of concrete facts we are given irrelevant discussions, and instead of proof, assumptions and assertions. It does not matter much, after all, for the conclusion of the whole differs from the theme announced. We are in a different sphere and concerned with widely different issues. For it is not that Christ is the principle of order in history, but that his teaching of love is worthy to be such. It is a small thing to say, He made a universal religion possible; it is a greater thing to add, The religion He made possible is one that ought to be universal, for its ideal is the humanest and the most beneficent that has ever come to man. (P. 550.) Here we emerge on solid ground, but it is not the point to which attention was directed when we set out. We have dwelt upon the defects of the book. It goes without saying that it has many and high merits: it is fresh, learned, up to the times in the results of criticism; it has many telling phrases and elo- quent passages; it contains sound argumentation and acute criticism. It would be pleasant to dwell on its good things, but, after all, they are incidental, while the defects are fundamental. It sets forth the philos- ophy of the Christian religion as the philosophy of the universe. So we are set right, ex cathedra, about everything - free will, Darwinism, the noumena of God, man, and the world, history, philosophy, the theory of knowledge, the problem of evil, the ethnic faiths. On we go in a torrent with debatable points decided authoritatively, often with- out discussion, every moment. So that finally, notwithstanding dis- claimers, religion seems identified with knowledge, theology with a theory of the universe, and Christ himself with the principle of an idealistic philosophy. Yet Dr. Fairbairn himself points out that "there is indeed in all history nothing more tragic than the fact that our heresies have been more speculative than ethical, more concerned with opinion than with conduct." In our judgment the book will do its share in continuing the " tragedy," making men to suppose that "where there is no knowledge the highest, if not the sole, reality is absent" (p. 57), and to identify religion with opinion, a Christian theology with a Logos speculation. To define Christ as " the factor of order in history," " the consti-</page><page sequence="20">I 0 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY tutive condition of a rational system," transforms Jesus of Nazareth into the most insubstantial of abstractions. To suppose that this con- ception has worked "as truth," that "true men receive it, are made truer by it, so use it as to build up the world in the love and pursuit of the truth as it had never been built up before," is to misread wholly the story of the past; and to suppose that it is a message for our day is equally to misunderstand the present, for the truth of the Christian religion is only obscured and its power diminished by such identifica- tions of its essence with the phases of a passing philosophy.
