Evidently not much detail was recorded about methods of wolf control during the American colonial period or Young would have hunted it out. Ae weaknesses in these parts probably are inherent in the lack of historical record. Howeser, of more recent history, there is much more to the legal hassle that has pervaded the transition from bounty hunting to salaried professionals in government service than is told here. Young was one of the few men associated with the era; it is a misfortune that he did not expand this part of his book. Likewise, the efforts of the research branch to provide the hunters with the highest order of control technique is a related subject desernzing fuller treatment. Neverthele!ss, the substance of the book can be said to fulfill the author's intent and the title of the volume. The core of the book is a series of chapters devoted to the accounts of the capture of certain renegade wolves, the loners. Itere is a dulling redundancy to the description of wolf character as outlaw, renegade, or wanton killer, but this is relieved by a certain amount of vicarious excite- ment generated by the descriptions of wolf activi- ties. Some readers may feel that the author slipped into an anthropomorphic translation of wolf be- havior. Although the professional hunter is indeed clever at reading trail signs, the translation of trail signs into wolf mental processes is a long step, and to some extent it is overdone in these chapters. The literary style in places seems crossbred be- tween cowboy colloquialism and an affected form of high literary description. In places it seems that the author was carried away by the beauty and magnitude of a natural scene too enormous for verbalization. Descriptions of wolf behavior must have been created out of conjecture, particularly the parts relating the activities of wolves at night. Some of the detail laclcs credibility; for example, the description of Big Foot who campaigned at the age of 3 to lead the pack, was whipped, but came back at the age of 4 to take over leadership. It is just this kind of sleuthing that characterizes the professional hunter reading trail signs. It makes exciting reading where otherwise a narrative might drag. From time to time the author has injected into the framework of the book accounts of human interest. This is a relief from too much emphasis on wolf criminology. Although the author was himself a government hunter he seems not to have succeeded in tran- scribing the nature of the hunter into words, al- though it appears that he wanted to do so. It is doubtful if the character of the professional wolfer ean be articulated; and if this is soX there is no discredit to the author. He had a high sense of duty that is reflected in the chapter on the gosZernment hunter. This reviewer has the feeling that the sense of duty does indeed characterize the federal hunter. Howevern the attribute is not possessed solely by the government hunter, as the chapter seems to infer. To a large extent, this dedication might be the crowning tribute to the concept of predator control under governlnent supervision as compared with the bounty system. In keeping with the title, however, the book is more about wolves than about the life oÂ£ the government hunter. In the body of the book the author takes a stand against outlaw wolves-the same stand of the livestockman during an era of western develop- ment. It can be understood only by those who have lost to the ravages of natural forces. This is a bygone age insofar as wolf predation is con- cerned, especially with the transition from open ranging to the feed-lot production of livestock. In more recent times the general public has come to view the wolf as a majestic symbol of the wilderness. The reader may not like the charac- terization of wolve!s as given by Young. This cur- rent in the bk outruns the epilogue lanenting the passing of the wolf in Colorado. The under- lying admiration that the hunter had for the hunfted, despite the tribulation each caused the other, is revealed. The impact on ie reader is hard to predict. He may be alienated by the stockman's and the wolfer's attitudes; he may not be convinced of the intent of the closing chapter. All in all, Stan Young's last book is to be cher- ished for its honest presentation of an episode in American history that otherwise might not have been recorded firsthand. Young was part of the scene. He witnessed a passing era. His account is all the more valuable in that few people with his experience have been inclined to write their experiences down.-HORACE F.

In his preface Carlander states he aimed his book as t'an index to the literature and at demon- strating the gaps in information on freshwater fishes of the United States and Canada.&gt;' He has not only provided a reasonably good index to the literature available through 19616, but has done a masterful job of compiling and summarizing much of the life history information available. The volume has some omissions, as the author acknowledgesn but I have found it a useful quick reference.

Books of this type tend to lose value as reference sources as new information is published. Four years have al- ready elapsed since data in the latest revision were compiled. However, much of the basic life history information for many species of freshwater fishes has been published and significant future contri- butions may be limited for some fishes. The book should be especially useful for man- agement biologists who frequently need a ready source of general life history information to answer public requests for information, and to evaluate requests to stock exotic species. T. C. BJORNN, Idaho Cooperative Fishery Unit, University of Idaho, Moscow. Animal Senses. By Robert Burton. Taplinger Publishing Company, New York. 1970. 183pp. $7.9S. We can praise the author of this modest book on a big subject for a nontechnical treatment of a work in the highly technical field of physiology. One puts the book down with a feeling that he has obtained a grasp of animal senses without having had any previous knowledge of sonics, op- tics, neurology, electronics, and similar subjects. Readers are cautioned to beware of anthropo- morphism regarding the field of animal senses. "We know now that there are sounds beyond the range of our hearing; that we cannot perceive them does not mean that they do not exist. Simi- larly we know that there are smells and sights that are beyond us and that there are senses we do not po!ssess." Burton stresses the interaction of environment and an animal's senses "as a continually regulating system designed to bring the greate'st benefit to the animal." He is a stern advocate of a thorough testing of all theories and ideas, through a full range of experiments and field observations de- signed to prevent any misleading conclusions. Bird migration has baffled scientists for years. It is still an unsolved riddle. Burton does a neat job of abstracting present knowledge of the sub- ject, pointing out that researoh has demonstrated the incredible ability of birds' eyes and the almost uncanny ability of the brain to process informa- tion received through the eyes. He further brings out the possibility that the sense of balance and the sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field con- tribute to birds' navigational skills. The author skillfully uses examples to show the many facets of animal senses. He ranges from the lowest forms of animal life to the highest. We learn many interesting facts from his examples. For example, the use of ultrasonic clicks by some moths to prevent bats from taking them, for bats know that moths making these clicks are distaste- ful; and that some termites sense the earth's mag- netic field and orientate themselves to it. Citations to the Spage bibliography are not given in the text, and this makes for easier diges- tion of the reading. A fuller bibliography, how- ever, could be expected. For in-stance, on page 40, experiments pitting kangaroo rats against a barn owl and a rattlesnake are described. The bibliog- raphy fails to tell where we can find the publica- tion in which these e-xperiments were first printed. An assiduous typo hunter, the reviewer could find but one typographical error; on page 37. Thirty-two diagrams contribute to the reader's understanding of animal senses; 19 photographs illustrating various phases of animal senses were well chosen. Nothing can give a better grasp of the book's scope than the titles of the 11 chapters: "Under- standing Animals"; "Listening for Trouble"; "Rec- ognition Sounds"; "Animal Sonar Systems"; "Field of Vision"; "Seeing in a Different Light"; "Finding the Way Home"; "Panorama of Smells"; "Feelina Vibrations"; "Heat, Cold, and Comfort'; and "Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields." For a competent, thorough, and accurate intro- duction to animal senses, one can depend on this book. GALE MONSON, Audubon Naturalist Soci- ety, Washington, D.C. Positive Feedback, A General Systems Approach to Positive/Negative Feedback and Mutual Causality. Edited by J. H. Milsum. Pergamon Press, Oxford. l968. 169pp. $6.30. Systems analysis as a way of thinking and making decisions about the intricate worlds of management is finding ever-increasing acceptance by business and government. It is applicable whether the thing managed is a large corporation, a manufacturing process, or a natural resource. Wildlife resources, for example, are intricately organized systems with both ecological and hu- man managetnent components; therefore, systems analysis is an essential tool for wildlife adminis- trators and technical staffmen. A wealth of literature on the subject is pouring forth, and Positive Feedback is part of the stream. This small beek is an elementary review of systems theory, but it is not an elementary textbk review. Because established specialists wrote it, it is more like a review for specialists. If the reader is versed in the field, he will enjoy reading the book. If he is not, he will still enjoy it and this peeking ahead in his education. If he is a stranger t.f) general systems theory, he should first try a more elementary presentation. The title, Positive Feedback, is misleading.
