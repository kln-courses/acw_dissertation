<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLEMENT OF AILEXANDRIA AND THE PHILONIC DOCTRINE OF THE DIVINE POWER(S) BY DAVID T. RUNIA ABSTRACT: The present paper offers a comprehensive examination of how Clement appropriates the Philonic doctrine of the divine powers. It first ex- amines the biblical basis of the doctrine, in which Pauline influence is super- imposed on Genesis. It then successively treats the subject in the areas of theology, cosmology and the doctrine of creation, including the creation of humanity. For Clement experience of the divine power (usually in the singu- lar) leads to knowledge of God (to the extent possible) and intimacy with him through the Son. Clement's Philonic heritage has enabled him to develop a positive and above all a dynamic theology. 1. As Eric Osborn has never ceased reminding us in a scholarly career that has spanned half a century, the second century was the first and most decisive watershed in the formation of Christian theology. By the end of that century the main outlines had been drawn, notably in the achieve- ments of Justin, Irenaeus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria. Osborn has written significant monographs on all of these theologians.' Clement was his first love. And now, as his scholarly career draws to a close, he is about to present us with a monograph that will bring together his mature views on this seminal yet elusive thinker. This article wishes to honour Eric as a mentor and friend by offering him some material that may assist him in the great task he has taken upon himself. One of the many questions relating to the origins of Christian theology in Alexandria which we would like to know a lot more about is its rela- tions to the Hellenistic-Jewish thought that preceded it in the same city. As Father Van Winden and Annewies Van den Hoek have amply shown, I Justin Martyr, BHTh 47 (Tiibingen 1973); Tertullian: First Theologian of the West (Cambridge 1997); Ireaeus of Lyons (Cambridge 2001); The Philosophy of Clement of Alexandria, Texts and Studies N.S. 3 (Cambridge 1957). The thought of the four fathers is com- pared in a more systematic way in two further monographs: The Beginning of Christian Philosophy (Cambridge 1981); The Emergence of Christian Theology (Cambridge 1993). ?

In two important con- tributions Eric Osborn has wrestled with this puzzle, which he approaches with reference to the paradox first formulated by Mondesert and Chadwick: why does Clement use so much material from a thinker whose intellectual context and problems were different than his own, and moreover barely acknowledge the debt?5 It is natural to approach this question from the viewpoint of Clement, starting with his writings and examining the extent to which Philonic mate- rial can be discovered in them. This approach has been carried out most thoroughly and convincingly by Annewies van den Hoek.6 In the present contribution I shall embark a slightly different route. My starting-point will be Philo, and in particular a theme which is universally recognized as cen- tral to his thought, the doctrine of the divine powers. The aim will be to examine the extent to which Clement shows that he is acquainted with 2 J. C.

The results will make a contribution to a further understanding of why Clement was so attracted to the heritage of Philonic thought and was pre- pared to use it to such a remarkable extent in his writings. I have to admit that my method in this article does not entirely follow the principles of problematic elucidation so strongly advocated by Eric Osborn.7 Its purpose will be served if its results provide materials that he will be able to use as the basis for his bold insights. 2. First it will be worth our while to look at the Philonic doctrine itself. Although all the major studies on Philo deal with it from various per- spectives, we are now fortunate to have an excellent monograph that is devoted to it exclusively.8 The Italian scholar Cristina Termini argues that scholars have been wrongly fixated on trying to explain Philo's doctrine with reference to Greek philosophical and religious texts. It is more valu- able to study the intersection of the biblical texts on which Philo is com- menting and theological notions that were developed in Hellenistic Judaism. She sees five chief areas in Philo's thought where the doctrine plays an important role: (1) in order to explore and explain the nature of the divine theophany, i.e. God's appearance and action in created reality, especially as seen in relation to God's attributes and names; (2) as an instrument of thought for reflecting on God's nature, especially with regard to questions of anthropomorphism and the divine presence in the cosmos; (3) as part of the theological schemas (also including the Logos) which are used to expound the symbolism of the ark and the Cherubim; (4) in questions of divine theodicy and especially in the context of the creation of the human being; (5) in the theme of God as the bond (6aEoT6), both of the universe and in relation to the human soul. In her study Termini shows that a striking aspect of Philo's doctrine, which separates him from other Hellenistic-Jewish thinkers, is that he uses the term ivva,gtS more often in the plural than in the singular when speak- ing of God. Seldom, moreover, does he use the term as the subject of verbs of action. This shows, according to Termini, that despite some appear- ances to the contrary, the doctrine in no way comes into conflict with Philo's fundamental conviction of Jewish monotheism. One should not 7 See above, 'Eric Francis Osbor: a Tribute', p. 3. 8 C.

She does not hesitate to affirm that there is an element offiction involved, i.e. what one has to resort to when speaking of the divine action in the world. From the viewpoint of Jewish monotheism, she argues, the doctrine of the powers is in fact less 'dan- gerous' than the doctrine of the Logos, as the subsequent history of Patristic thought will show.9 Termini's conclusions provide us with a valuable instrument for our study, even if some of her interpretations (e.g. her view on the fictionality of the powers as divine hypostases or her conviction that the Greek philo- sophical background is secondary in importance) might be disputed. She presents the main evidence that the extant Philonic corpus contains. We shall use her results as a backdrop when examining the extent to which Clement appropriates elements of Philo's doctrine. 3. A first general observation that should be made is that Philo's and Clement's writings are rather different corpora, even though they are both linked by a common desire to base their thought on Scripture and both have a positive attitude towards philosophical doctrines which can be used to understand and explain it. Philo's writings contain much more direct exegesis, which is moreover almost always directly focused on the Pentateuch. 50% of all Philo's biblical quotations are from Genesis. For Clement the figures are 12% if we take his use of the Old Testament only, and less than 5% for his use of the whole Christian Bible.'0 Clement refers less fre- quently to the doctrine of creation than Philo does. Nowhere do we find a full systematic account of how he interprets the Mosaic cosmogony and the early history of humanity." This might change if we ever manage to obtain a copy of the lost Hypo_poseis, as Eric Osborn has long hoped.'2 The much discussed remarks of Photius on this work indicate that it must have con- tained extensive commentary on the early parts of Genesis, and moreover 9 See her conclusion on p. 238, which I translate in my review of the study at SPhA 15 (2003) 151-156. 10 These figures are based on a comparison between Biblia Patristica Supplment Philon d'Alexandrie (Paris 1982) and the index of Biblical passages in the edition of Clement in GCS vol. 4.1-26.

RUNIA suggest that Philonic influence might have been quite strong.13 Clement's style of writing, especially in the Stromateis, is more elliptical and elusive than Philo's. These factors should encourage the interpreter to look for subtle changes of emphasis in his adaptation of anterior material, a method that Van den Hoek has developed well in her analyses of Clementine texts. 4. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to observe that in his references to divine power Clement refers much more often to the actual text of scripture than his Alexandrian predecessor. It is remarkable but true, I believe, that Philo never cites a biblical text which speaks literally of God's dunamis. The chief reason for this is that such texts are almost non-exis- tent in the Pentateuch.'4 Philo could have referred to texts in the Psalms and prophets, but he does not do this. It may be surmised that he regarded dunamis primarily as a philosophical term that can be used to explain Mosaic language. At Spec. 1.45 he records Moses' request to God in Ex. 33:18, 'Show me your glory (660a)', and places the following paraphrase in the prophet's mouth: 'your glory I consider to be the powers (/vvaiel;) that keep guard around you, of which the comprehension up to the present escapes me but creates in me a great desire to gain knowledge of them'. Clement, on the other hand, cites at least 14 biblical texts in which the word dunamis or a verbal equivalent is used in relation to the divine power, as can be seen in the following list:15 Ps. 32:6 (Protr. 63); Ps. 83:2 (Str. 6.30); Ps. 109:2 (Paed. 1.61); Matt. 24:29 (Protr. 81); Luke 1:35 (Exc. 60); Rom. 1:16 (Exc. 12);16 1 Cor. 1:24 (Str. 1.169, 174, 6.47, 7.7, Ecl. 27); 1 Cor. 2:5 (Str. 1.50, 5.9); 1 Cor. 12:11 (Str. 4.132); 2 Cor. 4:7 (Str. 4.131); 2 Cor. 6:7 (Str. 4.131); Eph. 1:21 (Ecl. 57); Phil. 4:13 (Str. 4.101); Col. 1:11 (Str. 5.60). For Clement, therefore, the term dunamis is biblical and represents a concept shared by scripture and the philosophers. We note that only three of the texts are from the Old Testament, in each case from the Psalms. But two other passages may be noted. At Str. 6.93 Clement cites Sap. 7.16, 13 See my comments at Philo in Early Chritian Literature 144 n. 44. 14 The LXX chooses to use other words such as ioXvS or metaphorical expressions referring to God's hand etc. As Termini, Le potenze di Dio 31 observes, Paul paraphrases God's iox; in Ex. 9:16 with 8ivajtu in Rom. 9:17. 15 I use broad criteria of inclusion, e.g. Col. 1:11 is included because eV caolI suvla?s kvcivvalo'vevot implies the assistance of divine Power (cf. 1 Cor. 6:7). 16 This text may also refer to 1 Cor. 1:24 (pace Stahlin). 260</page><page sequence="6">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 'in his hand both we and our logoi (stand)' paraphrasing the phrase ev XEtpL avrov with the Pauline r Buv&amp;laEt cal ootpiq.'77 More remarkably at Paed. 1.85 he gives a kind of distillation of Lev. 26.21-27 as follows: If you come to me upright, I too will be upright with you; if you proceed crookedly, I too will be crooked, says the Lord of the powers (eav 6p6oi l p6S .LE TiKCTE, Kay o6pO; 7Cpc; )1o za eav tX&amp;ftot tCopei)oeE, &amp;Kayo) ItXYtto, X&amp;yei ic{p o V ov vaEv). The final four words in the Greek give the appearance of being part of the Pentateuchal text, but have in fact been added by Clement in a kind of scriptural flourish.'8 Philo would surely not have disapproved, although the phrase does not align well with his favourite doctrine of the two powers linked to the two chief divine names. The most significant aspect of the above list of biblical texts is the pre- ponderant weight of Pauline material. Nine of the fourteen texts are taken from Paul's letters. The passage that stands out is 1 Cor. 1:24, where Paul states that he preaches Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. Linked with 1 Cor. 2:5 ('so that your faith may be not in the wisdom of human beings but in the power of God'), it is central to Clement's theol- ogy. His doctrine of divine power thus differs from that of Philo in that it has a firm textual base, in which Paul's Christocentric emphasis is super- imposed on selected Old Testament and Gospel passages. 5. Let us first turn to those passages in Clement's works where it is quite plain that he has direct acquaintance with Philo's doctrine of the powers. The first of these has some unusual features. The context is Clement's demonstration that the knowledge of God is hidden from human beings, but can be revealed as God's gift. Having quoted Paul's exclamation at Rom. 11:33 on the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge, he continues (Str. 5.80.3): And perhaps this is what the prophet hinted at when he orders the preparation of buried cakes which are unleavened, indicating that the truly holy secret account concerning the Uncreated one and his powers should be kept buried. Here Clement has lifted, virtually word for word, a sentence from Philo's allegory on the cakes (yKpu(pia;) that Sarah is asked to prepare for the 17 Cf. Termini's observation, Le potenze di Dio 84-85, that Philo often speaks of God's powers in concert with biblical anthropomorphic expressions. 18 The phrase is in fact only found at Zeph. 2:9. 261</page><page sequence="7">DAVID T. RUNIA three visitors at Gen. 18:6 in Sacr. 60.19 'The prophet', therefore, must be Moses. For Philo the three visitors represent God and his two highest pow- ers, sovereignty and goodness, a theological interpretation that should be kept away from the uninitiated who are not yet prepared for such esoteric knowledge. Clement has retained the reference to God and his powers without explaining what is meant by the phrase. It has to be agreed with Van den Hoek that the quote is not well integrated into its context.20 The allusion can be explained psychologically. A few lines later Clement pro- ceeds to quote Paul's statement on the 'hidden (&amp;oatcpvqpot) treasures of wisdom and knowledge' (Col. 2:3). The melange of Pauline texts in his mind clearly triggered a memory of Philo's allegory, which he is able to cite almost word for word but does not bother to adapt (elsewhere he refers to the visitors as angels, cf. Str. 4.123.1). In the remainder of his treatment of secret knowledge in Str. 5.59-88, as we shall discuss below (?7), Clement speaks of God's power in the singular without reference to the specifically Philonic doctrine of the two powers. Two other passages are valuable, though at most they present indirect evidence. At Str. 2.96.3-97.1 Clement paraphrases and adapts Philo's words at Virt. 165-167, which give a creative exegesis of Deut. 8:18, 'for he (God) gives strength (iaopv) to make power (86vajgtv)'. Human powers, and espe- cially the power to do good, are derived from God who is most powerful, and who should be imitated to the extent possible (the Platonic theme of 'assimilation to God'). Clement applies this to the true gnostic, who imitates God by sharing the divine grace that he has received. For both authors divine power refers primarily to goodness and grace, extended to creation, and transmitted further by human beings who follow in God's footsteps. In Str. 5.32-38 an extensive symbolic interpretation is given of the tem- ple furnishings and the vestments of the High priest based on Ex. 26-28, in which Clement draws extensively on Philo, but adapts the latter's ideas to his own purposes.2 The Cherubim on top of the ark of the covenant are interpreted as symbolizing the spirits which give praise to God, while their wings symbolize the services rendered on high by powers on the left and 19 The adjective 'unleavened' is added from the further allegory on Ex. 12:39 in Sacr. 62. 20 Van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria 195. 21 A full interpretation of Clement's dependence on Philo's allegorical interpretation of the Temple, the vestments and the High priest is given at Van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria 116-147. 262</page><page sequence="8">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA on the right (5.36.4). This differs from the interpretation in Philo, for whom they represent the two highest powers of God (Mos. 2.99, QE 2.68). In his commentary on this passage, however, Le Boulluec draws attention to an Armenian fragment in which he explains that the angels on the left expel those who persevere in doing evil, while those on the right embrace those who repent and give thanks to God.22 The basic opposition between pun- ishment and beneficence is the same as we find in the Philonic doctrine of the powers, especially in QE 2.68, where the merciful power is intro- duced as subordinate to the beneficent power and the punitive power as subordinate to the ruling power. Similarly on the following page (5.37.5-38.1) the High priest's cap is taken by Clement as symbolizing the Lord's royal authority (eoouvia paaottXi ), since Christ is Head of the Church (cf. Eph. 5.23, Col. 1:18). The same general idea in Philo is applied to the High priest (Mos. 2.132). But it is worth noting that in ?133 Philo interprets the gold plate above the headpiece, which contains the four letters of the divine name, as sym- bolizing that nothing can exist with invoking Him who is, since his goodness and gracious power hold all things together. Recollection of this reference to divine power may well have encouraged Clement in his interpretation of the High priest's cap (note that in Philo eovouia is often used in the context of the doctrine of the divine powers, cf. Cher. 27, Sacr. 59-60). 6. There can be no doubt, then, that Clement knows the Philonic doctrine of the divine powers. To my knowledge, however, there is no passage in Clement in which he explicitly takes over the Philonic doctrine of two chief powers. In Str. 5.80.3, as we saw above (?5), the doctrine is present in the Philonic passage from which Clement quotes, but is left to one side. It must be concluded that Clement saw no value in emphasizing two particular divine powers at the expense of the rest. Yet it would be wrong to conclude that Philo's doctrine was of no importance for Clement, because the polarity of divine activity that Philo expresses through it in terms of grace and authority does appear most prominently in his work. In chapters 8 and 9 of the Paedagogus Clement argues strongly against Gnostic opponents that God is both good and just. Quoting Rom. 7:12, he contends that Paul knows that what is just is also good and that he aligns both terms (i.e. 22 A. Le Boulluec, Climent d'Alexandrie: Les Stromates, Stromate V, Vol. II: Commentaire, bibliographie et index, Sources Chretiennes 279 (Paris 1981) 151. 263</page><page sequence="9">DAVID T. RUNIA aiKata and &amp;ya%fi) with the same power (this refers to ~evrxok in the Pauline verse).23 He then goes on to say (Paed. 1.74.1): But no one is good, except his Father (cf. Matt. 19:17). This same one, his Father, is one, and made known through multiple powers. And this is what is meant by 'no one knew the Father' (Matt. 11:27), who was all things before the coming of the Son. In consequence it is truly apparent that the God of all things is singly one, good, just, creator, Son in the Father, to whom is the glory forever and ever. Amen. The next chapter is given the heading: 'It belongs to the same power both to be beneficial and to punish, and this is the paedagogic method of the Logos'.24 We can thus summarize Clement's thought as follows: God is revealed in many powers, but both beneficence and judgment belong to the same power, and it is shared by both the Father and the Son, who reveals it in his paedagogic role. The Philonic polarity of beneficence and correction is adapted to the role of the Son as the divine Instructor. A similar view is found in the Stromateis. The Law is beneficial, he writes at 1.173.3, because it can make unjust people just. Citing a nice combi- nation of two verses from Proverbs, he continues as follows (1.173.5): 'To know the Law is the sign of a good understanding (Btavoiac daya&amp;fg)' (Prov. 9:10), and further: 'Evil men do not know the Law, but they that seek the Lord (t6v iCptov) will understand in all that is good (Ev To &amp;'yaOp)' (Prov. 28:5). The providence that administers must be both authoritative (icpia) and good (&amp;ayaoi). For it is the power of both that distributes salvation, the one disciplining by means of punishment as (an) authoritative (power), the other showing kindness through beneficence as a benefactor. Although here too Clement declines the invitation to speak of two pow- ers, the polarity between the two aspects emphasized is exactly the chief emphasis of the Philonic doctrine. We note too the divine name Lord is used in the second biblical citation in order to introduce the disciplining power, which again is close to Philonic practice.25 Just as is almost always the case in Philo, God's goodness and mercy is given the first emphasis, but the second aspect is regarded as complementary. 23 The connection between 'command' and divine power might at first sight seem odd, but becomes comprehensible if we recall Philo includes the nomothetic and enjoin- ing and prohibiting powers in his schemes; cf. Fug. 104, QE 2.68. 24 My translation here is deliberately a bit free, but this is the gist of Clement's mean- ing; cf. 85.1, 87.3. 25 Cf. Her. 166, Fug. 98, Mut. 19, Somn. 1.162, QE 2.68. 264</page><page sequence="10">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA Although Clement on occasion refers to a plurality of divine powers, as in Paed 1.74.1 cited just above and one or two other texts,26 he much prefers to speak of God's power in the singular. A fine example is found at Str. 5.82.1-2, when he affirms that God has many titles such as the One or the Good or Intellect or Being or Father or God or Creator or Lord, but that none of these should be taken as his definitive name since they all together are indicative of his almighty power. Even here, in the context of so many titles (among which are included the two which Philo habitu- ally associates with his two chief powers), Clement prefers to speak of a single divine power, which is so great that it encompasses all the charac- teristics that these epithets portray. 7. A second theological context in which Clement modifies the Philonic doctrine of the divine powers is the theme of God's hidden nature dis- cussed in Books 2 and 5 of the Stromateis. In both cases Philo's interpretation of Moses' ascent at Post. 13-20 is interwoven into the account. Van den Hoek has subjected these passages to a thorough analysis which we shall draw on in order to examine how the theme of divine power is treated.27 In Philo Moses begs God to reveal his own nature which is so hard to divine (Post. 13, based on Ex. 33:13). He enters into the darkness (cf. Ex. 20:21) where there is no materiality. God is wholly transcendent, but has nevertheless filled the entire universe with himself by means of his pow- ers, which stretch to its very boundaries and connect everything by means of harmony (Post. 14). God is both near and far. He takes hold of us with his creative and his punishing powers, but does so in such a way that his essential nature is kept far away from even our spiritual mode of under- standing (Post. 20). Clement's reworking reads as follows (Str. 2.5.4-5):28 But he who is far off has come very near, an unspeakable marvel: 'I am a God who draws near' says the Lord (Jer. 23:23). He is remote in essence- for how could what is begotten have ever approached the Unbegotten?-, but very near in power, by which he holds all things in his embrace. 'Shall one do things in secret, and shall I not see him?', Scripture says (cf. Jer. 23:24), for the power of God is always present, taking hold of us through the power of contemplation, beneficence and instruction. 26 E.g. Protr. 112.1, Str. 4.156. 27 Van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria 148-152, 168-176. 28 Translation Van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria 149 (with slight changes). 265</page><page sequence="11">DAVID T. RUNIA When comparing the two texts, we first note that Philo's plurality of powers have been replaced by the singular power of God. Philo emphasizes the cosmological role of the powers in ensuring that God is present to the entire universe, including human beings. This is consistent with his view that the powers represent divine activity in the cosmos (what Termini has called their theophanic purpose).29 For both Philo and Clement God 'takes hold' of us (anoulevrFl) by means of his power(s). Philo emphasizes the neg- ative side: we are kept far away from God's essential nature. Clement is more positive: God's power is present to us in the way he observes, helps and disciplines us.30 The juxtaposition of &amp;uvageit 5)VvaIgt (2.5.5) is striking31 and we may well ask why Clement duplicates the reference to divine power in this way. My suggestion would be that he wishes to emphasize both the dynamic activity of the divine power and its presence as a reality in the form of the Logos who is our instructor and guide.32 The role of the Logos is made clearer in the parallel text in Str. 5.71.3-5. The nature of God is hidden. How then are we to gain knowledge of him? Clement advocates purification and philosophical analysis of a special kind: If then, removing all attributes from the bodies and from the so-called incor- poreals, we hurl ourselves towards the greatness of Christ, and from there we advance in holiness towards the abyss, we would somehow make an approach in our understanding of the almighty, getting to know not what he is, but what he is not. Shape, movement, rest, throne, place, right or left of the Father of the universe, none of these should be understood as such, even if it is so written. The meaning of all these expressions will be demonstrated in the appropriate place. The first cause is not in a place, but transcends both place and time, and also name and conception. For this reason Moses says 'revealyourself to me' (Ex. 33:13), hinting most plainy that God cannot be taught or spoken by human beings, but is knowable only through the power that proceeds from him. For the quest is formless and unseen, but the grace of his knowledge comes from him through the Son. As in the earlier passage Clement adapts Philo's words in Post. 14-16. Following Van den Hoek, we have made this clear by introducing italics in the translation which indicate which words have been taken over more 29 See above ?2. 30 Note that 86vaiget cannot refer to our faculties, because eioxtlcTi must pick up 7r6Wolgat in the biblical text.

But there are quite subtle differences in treatment. For Philo the emphasis falls on the unknowable essence of his transcendent nature, which is impossible to know but the quest is still worth striving for. Even though God is transcendent, his powers are nevertheless present in the cosmos. The intent is made clearer in a later passage at Post. 167- 169, where a second text, Ex. 33:23, 'you shall see what is behind, but my face you will not see', is brought into play. Philo introduces the famil- iar distinction between essence and existence. God's essence (i.e. the face) is unknowable, but knowledge of his existence is derived from the powers that follow and are in attendance on him (i.e. what is behind, ?169). Clement agrees with Philo that God cannot be known as he really is. This is the chief message of negative theology, instructing us to aim at understanding what he is not. But when Moses asks that God reveal him- self, the answer is not negative, as it is by implication in Philo.34 God is knowable, but only through his power, which Clement does not connect with divine forces in the cosmos, but with the knowledge that comes through the Son (cf. also 5.82.4). God is unknowable, yet he is made known by grace and in Christ. Alan Le Boulluec has claimed that the entire programme of Clement's thought is contained in this text, and specifically in the role that it accords to Christ in the mystical achievement of the supreme knowledge sought by the philosophers.35 First the gnostic must hurl himself at the greatness of Christ. Because the Son is to be identified with wisdom, science and truth, this knowledge admits of demonstration (cf. Str. 4.155-157). Moreover the Saviour can save human beings from the passions that impede them from advancing to God. Finally he can lead them to the ultimate vision of God, to the extent that it can be attained. This is the role of Christ as wisdom and power of God, as taught by the apostle Paul. Clement agrees with Philo that ultimate knowledge of God as he is in his essence is unreachable-for God is even beyond the One and the monad,36 so how could any circumscription in knowledge or language be 33 Cf. Van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria 168, but unfortunately she has left out the (for us) vital phrase at 5.71.5 'but is knowable only through the power that proceeds from him'. 34 It is made explicit in the parallel passage at Spec. 1.43. 35 Le Boulluec, Commentaire 247. 36 Paed. 1.71.1; the phrase is adapted from Philonic texts, cf. Leg. 2.2, Contempl. 2, Praem. 40. 267</page><page sequence="13">DAVID T. RUNIA possible? But in his doctrine of the Son-Logos he proves to be more opti- mistic than Philo. In Philo's case it is only God's existence that can be known through the action of his powers in the cosmos.37 For Clement the word became flesh (5.72.3, alluding to John 1:14) and, when hung on the tree, brought us to knowledge. The central role accorded by Philo to the theo- phanic presence and action of God's powers in the cosmos is replaced by the single event of the incarnation.38 8. It has been observed so far that Clement in a number of texts replaces Philo's reference to a plurality of powers with a reference to a single power. We might ask the further question whether this move is simply a conse- quence of Clement's greater emphasis on Christ the Logos, or that it involves a deliberate correction of Philo's point of view. It is easy to imag- ine that, when reading the text in Post. 169 on 'the powers that follow and are in attendance on God' to which we referred above (?7), Clement might have asked the question posed by many modem interpreters of Philo whether these powers belong to God or are separate from him as hypostases. His Christocentric emphasis would thus solve a theological problem pre- sent in Philo. Admittedly this is pure speculation. It is possible, however, to make a comparison between two texts, one in Philo and the other in Clement, which might shed light on the issue. At the end of his treatment of the First commandment in Spec. 1.305-307, Philo refers to and partially cites Deut. 10:16-17: 'Circumcise the hardness of your heart and do not stiffen your neck any longer. For the Lord your God, this one is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God who is great and mighty and fearsome...' Encouraged by the two divine names, Philo alludes to the doctrine of the two powers. Clement, in a different context (Str. 6.30.5), which discusses how the Greeks stole certain stories of heroic deeds from the Bible, quotes the same text. He links it with Ps. 83:2, 'How lovely are your tents, Lord of the powers'. The Lord God is Lord of the powers and principalities (dpXai) and authorities (ETooaiat). 'Powers' for Clement in this context are 37 Two more optimistic texts are exceptional and controversial: Leg. 3.100, Praem. 46; cf. D. Winston, The Ancestral Wisdom: Hellenistic Philosophy in Second Temple Judaism. Essays of David Winston, edited by G. E. Sterling, Studia Philonica Monographs 4, Brown Judaic Series 331 (Providence RI 2001) 158-162, who argues for a vision of the intuitive reason. 38 Van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria 176, also notes that the role of the divine pow- ers in Post. 14 &amp; 20 are reduced in the case of Abraham to the initiation by means of an angel (referring to Gen. 22:11-12), which 'brings the story back to biblical proportions'. 268</page><page sequence="14">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA the cosmic powers such as winds and showers which pagan heroes like the philosopher Empedocles are said to have controlled. But these powers should recognize who is the true Ruler. We see Clement once again avoid- ing the Philonic doctrine of the plurality of divine powers directly associated with God and instead choosing this time to interpret powers in a cosmo- logical sense. In so doing he stays closer to the biblical text that the two Alexandrians quote. There are a few other passages in which Clement speaks of powers in the limited cosmological sense we saw in the text just discussed.39 As the 'consuming fire' (Deut. 4:24) God is the almighty ruler over such powers.40 But in another context the Lord can also save us from the mighty clash of the same powers.41 In actual fact, however, the role of these powers in Clement's thought is very limited, not to be compared with the role of the divine powers in Philo. Clement transfers the full weight of the cosmic powers onto Christ the Logos. Nowhere is this more emphatically stated than in the final chapters of the Protrepticus. Those who worship idols and lifeless things do not have faith in God or fully understand his power (104.3), for they are not sensitive to a certain 'providence of divine power' which sur- rounds us (cf. 103.1). Follow, then, the way of salvation that God offers to those who follow his laws. The truth is in fact not far off, but is our close neighbour, present 'in our hands and mouth and heart' (109.2).42 'With unsurpassed speed and accessible goodwill the divine power has shone forth on the earth and filled the whole world with the seed of salvation' (110.1), which could not have happened in so short a time without providential intervention. It was our teacher who filled all things with holy powers: cre- ation, salvation, beneficence, legislation, prophecy, teaching (112.1). This is the new creation (114.3). It is a holy and blessed power, through which God has become a fellow-citizen of human beings (117.1). In giving logos and knowledge to human beings, God has freely given of himself. This is the Son, the Christ, the Logos of God, the arm of the Lord,43 the power of the Universe, the Will of the Father (120.4). In this extraordinary sequence of texts we can see how the cosmological role of the divine powers such 39 E.g.

RUNIA as we find in Philo is integrated into a much broader range of powers attributed to or connected with the Logos,44 including the power that enables him to become a human being on earth and be our teacher. 9. We turn now more specifically to the doctrine of creation. In Philo two aspects of this doctrine are closely associated with the conception of divine power(s). Firstly there is the general theme of God's use of his creative power or powers in the act of creation itself. This is part of the doctrine of the two powers, associated primarily with the divine name theos. But in his commentary on the Mosaic creation account in Gen. 1, Philo does not refer to that doctrine specifically. Instead he first explains how the Logos is the place of the divine powers, and then affirms that God's cosmos-pro- ducing power is among these, having as its source that which is truly good (Opif. 21). In the second place Philo invokes the notion of God's powers in connection with the creation of humankind, and especially to explain the troublesome plural in Gen. 1:26. When God says 'let us make', he is holding conversation with his powers, so that he cannot be held responsi- ble for the evil deeds that humans will commit.45 As noted earlier in this article, we possess no Clementine text which gives an extended exegesis of the creation account in Genesis. The closest we have is found in Str. 5.92-96, which is an attempt to show how much Plato derived from Moses rather than a direct exegesis. Although the passage contains a number of allusions to Philo's De opjficio mundi and other treatises, Clement somewhat surprisingly does not pick up on the specific passage OpiJf 21, in which Philo affirms a link between Moses and Plato's identification of the goodness of God as the motive for creation. There is also no reference to the role of God's power in creation. But this does not alter the fact that the affirmation of God's goodness in creating the world of physical reality is one of the pillars of Clement's theology, which is directed in the first instance against Gnostic opponents. God's goodness is affirmed first in creation, then in salvation.46 The link with Philo is there, but in an atten- uated form. 44 But Clement does not use the metaphor of the bond (8eoi6S) which, as Termini shows (see above ?2), is so prominent in Philo. 45 Cf. Fug. 69, Conf. 171, QG 1.54 (but there is no reference to powers in Opif. 72- 76). For a detailed analysis of these complex texts see D. T. Runia, Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato, Philosophia antiqua 44 (Leiden 1986) 242-249; Termini, Le potenze di Dio 137-155. Philo adapts the theme of the division of labour between the demiurge and the 'young gods' in Plato's Tinaeus in order to solve a problem of theodicy. 46 See for example Osborn, Philosophy of Clement of Alexandria (n. 1) 45-53, 65-78. 270</page><page sequence="16">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA Gen. 1:26 is one of Clement's favourite Old Testament texts. He cites or alludes to it nearly 30 times.4 But it is exclusively the creation of human beings in God's image and likeness that interests him. The verb 'let us make' is cited only once, at Str. 5.29.1, where no reference is made to the problematics of the plural.48 We may be fairly certain, however, that Clement would not have been impressed with Philo's explanation of God talking to his powers. At Str. 3.34.1 he scathingly refers to certain impure and worth- less persons 'who claim that the human being was moulded by differing persons, and that the parts down to the navel was the product of a more god-like craft, whereas the parts below it were made by an inferior craft, which was the cause of the desire for sexual union'.49 This division of labour is much cruder than what we find in Philo. Clement has no strong motive to polemicize against his Jewish Alexandrian predecessor.50 There can be little doubt, however, that the idea of God's powers being invoked to explain human waywardness would not appeal to him and is therefore covered in charitable silence. 10. A second feature of the central anthropological text Gen. 1:26-27 which was of seminal importance for both Philo and Clement was the notion that human beings are created 'according to the image of God'. The var- ious exegeses of this text in Philo, often in combination with the second text Gen. 2:7, have been the subject of much research, including a well- known monograph by Tobin.51 In one extensive passage Philo makes an important link between the human being as image and the role of divine power. When scripture speaks of the voice of Abel's blood crying out to God from the ground (Gen. 4:10), Philo discerns a distinction in Mosaic psychology between two kinds of soul (Det. 83):52 47 Based on the 'Citatenregister' at 0. Stihlin and U. Treu, Cemens Alexandrinus, vol. 4 (Berlin 19802) 1. 48 This is in contrast to other second century writers, e.g. Justin, Dial. 62.2 and Theophilus, Ad Aut. 18, who both explain that God is talking to his Son. 49 According to information at Epiphanius Haer. 45.2, these heretics were Severiani. 50 There is no real interaction with contemporary Judaism in his work, and in this respect he differs quite markedly from Justin Martyr before him and Origen after him. 51 T.

Tobin, The Creation of Man: Philo and the History of Interpretation, Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series 14 (Washington 1983); see also Runia, Philo of Alexandria 334-340, 556-558. 52 Following J. Whittaker's lead (see 'The Terminology of the Rational Soul in the 271</page><page sequence="17">DAVID T. RUNIA The faculty which humans have in common with the irrational creatures has received blood as its essence, but the faculty which streams forth from the fountain of reason has received spirit (Rvelua), not moving air, but a kind of mark and impression of divine power, which Moses, using the appropriate term, calls 'image', indicating that God is the archetype of a rational nature, while the human being is a copy and likeness, by which I mean not the liv- ing being with a double nature, but the most excellent form of the soul, which intellect and reason have received as their allotment. Here Philo has no hesitation in combining the divine spirit which is inbreathed in Gen. 2:7 with the impress imagery of the eiKc0V in Gen. 1:26. Humans are rational because they have been marked or 'impressed' by the divine power. It will be instructive to compare a text in Clement. An essential part of his anthropology is his conviction that it is the creation of human beings in God's image and likeness that makes it possible for them to receive the divine power, which in turn allows them to extricate themselves from the web of passion and desire and exercise the spiritual gifts of faith, love, knowledge and prophecy.53 In arguing against Gnostic libertarians at Str. 3.42.5 he exhorts his readers to follow the commands found in scripture and become assimilated to the Lord to the extent possible: They must not live indifferently, but be purified to the extent possible from pleasures and desires and exercise care for their soul, by means of which they must achieve an orientation towards the divine alone. For if the mind is pure and delivered from all evil, it somehow becomes a recipient of the power of God, as the divine image in it comes to the fore... It is a typically Clementine mix: the Platonist formula 'assimilation to God to the extent possible,' which-note well-has been biblically rephrased, and the Socratic slogan 'care for the soul' are here combined with the biblical anthropology of Gen. 1:26-27. Both Clement and Philo before him thus make the link between divine power and the human being created as image of God. The difference between them is instructive. The Philonic texts have a primarily structural purpose, indicating what the nature of human beings is, whereas in Clement Writings of Philo of Alexandria', The Studia Philonica Annual 8 (1996) 1-20, esp. 1-2), I read icelripancat instead of the mss.'

Humanity is infused with divine power through Christ the Logos. Here too the influence of Pauline theology can be discerned and especially those texts which speak of the spir- itual empowerment received through Christ, e.g. 2 Tim. 2:2 cited at Str. 1.3.3, Phil. 4:13 cited at Str. 4.101.1, Col. 1:11 cited at Str. 5.60.2, and so on. 11. One final aspect of Philo's doctrine of divine power remains to be dis- cussed. In a number of passages Philo shows a strong awareness of the non- reciprocality of power when used to describe relations between God and creation and between God and human beings. Through his almighty power, God is able to create the cosmos, creating order where hitherto disorder and disharmony reigned. In his exposition of day one of creation, Philo devel- ops the notion of divine goodness by arguing that there is a vast gulf between the creator and what he creates and adds the comment (Opif. 23):54 With no one to assist him..., but relying solely on his own resources, God recognized that he had to confer the unstinting riches of his beneficence on the nature which of itself without divine grace could not sustain any good whatsoever. But he does not confer his blessings in proportion to the size of his own powers of beneficence-for these are indeed without limit and infinitely great-but rather in proportion to the capacities of those who receive them. The fact is that what comes into existence is unable to accommodate those benefits to the extent that God is able to confer them, since God's powers are overwhelming, whereas the recipient is too weak to sustain the size of them and would collapse, were it not that he measured them accordingly, dispensing with fine tuning to each thing its allotted portion. What is fascinating about this text is that the notion of divine power is linked to the theme of measurement. If God's goodness were not measured out, creation would not be able to accommodate it and so would suffer from an overdose of creative goodness.55 This, we might say, is the 'down- side' of divine power. It has to be mediated, or otherwise things will go badly wrong. In a number of texts Philo states that the role of mediation belongs to the Logos, whom he calls the 'measurer'.56 54 This is a continuation of the text at Opif. 21 discussed above in ?9. For a full commentary on these texts see my Philo On the Creation of the Cosmos according to Moses, Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series 1 (Leiden etc. 2001) 143-147. 55 The best parallels for this notion of a (potential) divine overdose of power are found in later Neoplatonist texts; cf. my 'Philo of Alexandria and the End of Hellenistic Theo- logy', in A. Laks and D. Frede (edd.), Traditions of Theology: Studies in Hellenistic Theology, Its Background and Aftermath, Philosophia Antiqua 89 (Leiden 2002) 281-316, esp. 296-299. 56 Cf. Sacr. 59-60, QG 1.4, 4.23 and my comments at Philo of Alexandria 138. 273</page><page sequence="19">DAVID T. RUNIA In another text Philo applies this idea specifically to the lesser creatures of creation, i.e. human beings (Mut. 232):57 What do we think is revealed in the text, 'shall not the hand of the Lord be sufficient (Num. 11:23)'? Surely it is this, that the powers of Him who is extend in all directions for the benefit not only of highly reputed creatures, but also of those who have a more humble reputation. To these he bestows what is fitting for them, according to the weights and measures of each soul, weighing and measuring by the equality inherent in himself the proportion due to each. In a number of other texts Philo also gives this principle an epistemo- logical application, e.g. at Spec. 1.43, where he interprets God's answer to Moses' request that he reveal himself (Ex. 33:13) as 'I bestow what is appropriate for the recipient, for it is not within a human being's power to receive that which it is possible for me to give.' Ontology and epistemology come together in Philo's notion that the ideas-which are contained in the Logos-can be regarded as measures, making it possible for creation to come into being and have an ordered, rational structure.58 These Philonic texts form an illuminating background for a striking pas- sage found in Clement's least well-known work, Quis dives salvetur. Having referred to John 1:18, 'no one has ever seen God; the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known,' and even gone so far as to speak of the feminine side of God, Clement encourages his listener to contemplate the mysteries of love, such as were revealed by God in begetting the Son (37.3-4): On account of love he descended, on this account he took on human nature, on this account he voluntarily experienced the human condition, so that, hav- ing been measured in relation to the weakness of us whom he loved, he would in return measure us towards his power. The logic of the passage is surely the same as what we found in Philo. Significantly Clement substitutes God's love for the conception of his good- ness found in Philo. God's love is poured out on humankind, but it has to be measured out in the process. The Son is the Logos, who has to be measured out in relation to human weakness, so that humanity can be 57 There may be an allusion to Wisdom 11:20 in this text. The words 'by the equal- ity inherent in himself' are difficult. They may refer to a balance of powers within the Deity which can be transmitted in the form of a well-proportioned mixture for his crea- tures. Cf. the passage on the mixing and tempering of God's powers at Deus 77-79. 58 On the ideas as measures see my Philo of Alexandria 138. 274</page><page sequence="20">CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA converted into the power that he possesses. Clement applies Philo's theme of the necessary measuring out of divine power to the mystery of the incar- nation, a theme that is wholly foreign to the Jew Philo. Between Father and Son, however, a different relation of reciprocality obtains. Eric Osbor has drawn our attention to a difficult but important text at Paed. 1.71.3.59 As we noted above (?6), for Clement, arguing against the Gnostics, God is both good and just. In this text goodness is associ- ated above all with God, justice with the Logos: When God is conceived as Father, because he is good, he has been called what he alone is, 'good'. But when, being the Son, he is the Logos in the Father, he is called 'just' on account of the reciprocal relation of love, a epi- thet that has been measured by the equality of their power. For Philo equality in God meant his beneficence could be fairly and appropriately measured out (in Mut. 232 cited above). Clement's trinitar- ian theology shifts the focus to the equality of divine power enjoyed by both Father and Son. It is the reciprocal love between them that links together the goodness and justice they possess. Clement has combined fea- tures of Philonic thought-the twin powers of goodness and justice, the role of the Logos as measurer-into a new theology centred on divine love shared by Father and Son. 12. The present investigation into the presence of Philo's doctrine of the divine power(s) in Clement has clearly shown that the two thinkers belong to a shared tradition of biblical exegesis. There can be no doubt that Clement knew the Philonic doctrine and was able to appreciate its theo- logical value. However, the tradition that the two thinkers share under- went a radical change of direction through the emergence of the Gospel, which placed everything in a new perspective. For Philo 6wvalgt is a philo- sophical term which allows the exegete to explain and expound the activ- ity of God as it is manifested in creation and humanity. Clement links Old Testament usage with the prominent use of the term in Paul to refer to Wisdom and Christ. The Christocentric focus of Clement's thought not only explains his preference for speaking of divine power in the singular. It also gives him a more optimistic view of how experience of the divine power can lead to knowledge of God and intimacy with him through the 59 In an unpublished paper on Clement and Middle Platonism presented to a con- ference in Newcastle, Australia, in July 2002. 275</page><page sequence="21">DAVID T. RUNIA Son. The chief emphasis of Clement's doctrine is on the role of divine goodness, mercy and grace in the world of created reality and in human life. This can be summed up in the role of Providence. Although no explicit reference is ever made by Clement to the Philonic doctrine of two pow- ers, the polarity of goodness and justice is important for him when argu- ing against Gnostic opponents. Goodness and justice are found side by side in God and in the Logos through the equality of Father and Son. The presence of the divine power marks the new creation which Christians experience. Clement's Philonic heritage has enabled him to develop a pos- itive and above all a dynamic theology.60 Queen's College University of Melbourne Parkville, Vic. 3052 Australia 60 Eric Osborn has inspired this paper with the many conversations he has held with me on the subject of the relation between Philo and Clement.
