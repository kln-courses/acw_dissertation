<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. Agassi* I. C. Jarviet Magic and rationality again Our I967 paper 'The Problem of the Rationality of Magic'l has created some controversy, and has been labelled both absurd and obvious. We would not deny the charge of obviousness. For if the basic question here is, as Steven Lukes believes (p. 256), how to understand beliefs that are prima facie irrational, then our suggestion-that first there had to be prior agreement on criteria of rationality of belief- was hardly startling. We by-passed detailed discussion of such criteria because this would take us into one of the most extensive debates in contemporary philosophy (for example, the entire vast literature on induction consists of attempts to state criteria for rational belief or rational choice between beliefs). Our heart would not have been in a summary of this literature because we thought it pointless. Unless beliefs are a sub-class of actions (which, we hinted in a footnote, they are), then it is not at all clear whether a belief can be rational or irrational, any more than whether it can be red or not red, lazy or energetic. To be more precise, it is quite generally agreed that the act of believing in a belief, or of holding on to a belief, may or may not be rational; not really the object of the act-the belief itself, the doctrine, the theory in question. While it makes sense to claim that Catholics, alchemists, phlogistonists, and Newtonians are rational or irrational, then it is loose to claim Catholicism, alchemy, phlogistonism and Newtonianism to be so. By and large we find ourselves in substantial agreement with the latest contribution to the controversy, Tom Settle's 'The Rationality of Science versus the Rationality of Magic'.2 He even takes up the cudgels against our chief critic (and the chief butt of our criticism) Professor J. H. M. Beattie.3 We wish to add to Settle's argument what we think we have learned from Beattie's criticism: we can offer new views and improve upon our previous paper; and we can offer a new diagnosis of deep ills in Beattie's counter-attack. For what Settle and we regard as *Joseph Agassi M.sc. PH.D. Professor of Philosophy, Boston and Tel-Aviv University, t Ian C. Jarvie B.SC.(ECON.) PH.D. Professor of Philosophy, York University, Canada; Visiting Professor, Sociology Dept., L.S.E. 236</page><page sequence="2">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again obvious in the philosophy of science, Beattie has yet to come to terms with. Hence, we join the fray, and will begin by trying to do expository justice to both sides. Beattie distinguishes between ritual actions on the one hand and practical, scientific, or proto-scientific (meaning pre-scientific) actions on the other (p. 240). His contention is that belief in the efficacy of magic ritual is not practical or proto-scientific: rather, he says, its (the belief's) 'imputation of a special power' is a symbolic expression. Obviously, such imputation may be a hypothesis, and hypotheses may be practical or proto-scientific or scientific. Beattie excludes this possi- bility: he thinks that science is 'based on experience and hypothesis- testing', and he sees nothing of the sort in 'the imputation of special powers' to spells and the like. Moreover, says Beattie, he who casts the spell, to him it matters little whether the spell works. This is directed against our observation, in accord with Frazer,4 that magic is proto-science (pp. 174-5). We claimed this suggestive view was relinquished by the tradition of social anthropology not because it led to Frazer's specific ethnographic errors (the usual explanation), but because it was rationalistic-it assumed that action is goal-directed and belief-dependent (p. I79). We discussed Beattie's earlier formulations of his view (in Other Cultures) and noted, first, that he shifts the problem from that of the rationality of magic to that of its meaning (p. 182). This, however, is a small point: the rationality of performing magic may emerge in the very attempt to bring out its meaning. But the meaning, for Beattie, is that enhanced significance of the event which gives rise to the magic ritual. We suggested this significance was all too often simply beyond the performer's knowledge or intent. Beattie's theory of meaning better suits non-magical rituals, such as the celebra- tion of a wedding and the breaking of a bottle of champagne at a ship- launching (p. 183). Beattie reads rather arbitrary 'symbolic' meanings into magical acts, readings which appear to appeal to western tastes rather than to magically minded people and contexts (p. 184). Finally we argued Beattie cannot allow magic to be 'practical' or 'proto- scientific' because scientifically he rejects it; which is an intrusion of a western prejudice. Beattie accepts ploughing as rational but not chant- ing and he tries to explain why the one who ploughs also chants. The very division of an act into turning over the crust of the earth on the one hand and chanting on the other is a mistake which raises the problem Beattie tries to solve. When we launch a ship and break a bottle over it we may entertain the hypothesis that the bottle plays no essential role, or declare the role of the bottle social rather than physical. The distinction makes little sense to the magic-minded, for he insists bottle-breaking is essential to a successful performance. Hence Beattie's problem scarcely arises. In the section of 'Reason and Ritual' replying to us Beattie defines 237</page><page sequence="3">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again 'ritual' as pertaining to a rite, and 'rite' as 'formal procedure or act'- 'of the kind', he adds, 'which we generally call religious or magical', admitting that this is fairly vague but stressing that it is precise enough to exclude scientific research (p. 241). Now why is science excluded ? Beattie is partial to causality and against the view that a spell can cause anything. We disagree: the hypothesis, we think, that currents cause magnetic attraction or repulsion at-a-distance as the case may be, is as causal as the hypothesis that spells cause good or bad luck, as the case may be. Both are false hypotheses, though some scientists of the first rank have accepted the one and others the other. But let us accept the distinction between magical causes-say by empathy or by contagion- and scientific causes-whatever these are (we confess ignorance)-for the sake of argument. Why deny scientific research its status as ritual? It has been so viewed by the western scientific tradition, beginning with Robert Boyle's Seraphick Love of 1659 which led to the foundation of the Royal Society, and with Spinoza's doctrine of learning as the highest expression of the love of God, and continuing with Einstein's confession of his 'cosmic religious feelings'. Beattie's view travesties western pre- judices, and is fair only to the prejudice specific to the antireligious sub-tradition in the west-is he aware of sharing with Frazer the feeblest aspect of Victorian scientism: hostility to religion? Beattie concedes (p. 242) the existence of borderline cases, like alchemy and astrology, but thinks these are not problematic since aspects of actions rather than actions can always be distinguished analytically. If so, it would not matter if science were the ritual of natural religion, since we could analytically distinguish in science between its ritual and 'empirically grounded' components. Beattie stresses (p. 242, line 7) that usually the distinction is evident enough. For the sake of the argument we shall agree that his, too, does not matter, and accept Beattie's version. Beattie defines 'expressive' as 'says something', and 'symbolic' as representing a 'notion' with some 'cultural value' (p. 242). A ritual, then, expresses a symbolism, or is a symbolic expression. Of course, it may 'degenerate into "empty ceremonial" ' (p. 242, line 4 from bottom), or symbolize different things to different people (lines 3 and 2 from bottom). So far we agree, and forbear asking who said it first. It follows, incidentally, that every action has a ritual aspect, perhaps a degenerate one, perhaps for Tom but not for Dick. Again, let us not quibble about who said so first, though, let us confess, had we found this in Beattie's writings prior to the publication of our paper, we would have gladly acknowledged this to him, both for the sake of decency, and for the purpose of strengthening our argument. Why Beattie does not refer to us when stating this view is clear: we have failed thus far to present it as succinctly as we do now. To repeat: a corol- lary to Beattie's theory of ritual (a formal procedure or act which 238</page><page sequence="4">J. Agassi and L. C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again says something about or represents the notion of a cultural value) is that every act is a ritual for someone, and no act is a ritual for everyone. Beattie notes that we connect the rationality of magic acts with belief in a magic theory (p. 243). Beattie, first, agrees that the magic per- former does believe in magic-as a matter of course, by the way. This, however, is a fact to be explained, he says, as a second point, not an explanation, as we think. No one offered this as explanation, he con- cludes as a third point. Vox populi, perhaps, is vox dei. It pains us to point out, as we feel obliged to, that Beattie is in error on his first point: magic acts can be performed as degenerate ('empty') ceremonials without faith in magic and even without cynical concession to the mob's faith in magic, etc. It pains us to point out, as we feel obliged to, that Beattie is in error on his third point: Frazer did offer rational explanations as rational explanations, along the lines we advocate, that we disagree with him in detail but not philosophically. But let these two points ride too, and let us take up Beattie's second point: let us see what Beattie is up to-in particular what Beattie finds an adequate way of explaining magic. First of all, says Beattie, we must know what it is we wish to explain, what is the proper demarcation of magic from non-magic. Beattie repeats his definition: magic is a ritual with expected efficacy. He says we reject his view while offering no alternative, and he parenthetically hints that we despair of the very possibility of demarcating magic (P. 243). Well, well. We find it difficult to endorse the view that a critic who claims he has demolished the view he criticizes has not done so if he offers no alternative to it. Further, we do not endorse the view that given a phenomenon to explain--or rather, to be more precise for a moment, a set of phenomena to offer an explanation schema of-we must demarcate it first. This kind of definitional magic has survived in western culture despite the sarcasm of great minds from Pascal to Popper. But, again, for the sake of this argument (alone) we now agree with Beattie on this and demarcate magic more precisely and more adequately than he does: magic, we say, is an anthropomorphic cosmology whose chief ingredients are luck and fate, whose chief tools are magic, failed magic, and magic conspiracies, and whose chief characteristic is the ease and sophistication with which it enables its adherents cogently to explain any event, and especially misfortune. We do not know whether the previous sentence is the correct demar- cation of magic; in particular, as we point out in our paper (p. 175 and note), the connection between magic and myth is thereby regrettably left unclear; but, nonetheless, we do think it is a better demarcation than Beattie's (p. 189 note). When a Jew passes a church, he will not spit on the ground unless he is superstitious; and then he surely will do 239</page><page sequence="5">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again it as a magic act-which, however, is devoid of social significance as is shown by the indifferent attitude of the slightly more enlightened Jew. When a relic or survival of magic is performed, such as throwing the bride's bouquet to the bridesmaid, it is magic to the naive and of social significance to the sophisticated. These cases are covered with ease by our definition but not so obviously by Beattie's. Even the detailed question, to what extent a naive twentieth-century girl really believes in the luck brought by catching the bouquet which the bride throws, even this can be studied on our definition. Perhaps this can be studied on Beattie's definition too. Since we are here playing the game of constructive criticism we can expect his reply-if he will kindly favour us with one-to include an elucidation. Meanwhile, we stick to our suggestion that we have offered a better demarcation of magic. Beattie chides us in one paragraph for our alleged failure to define magic, and in the next paragraph for the failure of our definition of rational belief: he does not like-he says not a word why-our defini- tion in terms of an adopted standard without specifying and/or suffi- ciently explaining that standard (pp. 240-4). Our reason is obvious: it is one thing to judge the rationality of other cultures (or of their members) by our standard, and quite another to judge a member of that culture by the standard of his own culture. What we tried to do in our paper was to treat the two problems separately, and we contended that Beattie (and others) confuse the two. Alas! We were not clear enough. In particular, about the first kind, we said much too little there-only in our final paragraph-and we left it for other publications, in which we presented our views on the matter more fully, both together and each of us separately. Beattie notes only that we examine the individual's rationality from the viewpoint of the adopted standard of that indi- vidual's own society; and, he adds, we are inconsistent in viewing the magician's belief in magic once as rational once not. Thanking Beattie for making us clarify a point, let us repeat more clearly: judged by his own standard the magician's act of belief is rational, by our own (ours meaning here Agassi's, Beattie's, Jarvie's, et al.) it is not. Obviously-and the accent is on the obviousness of the case-in a sense an African calling a witch-doctor, an eighteenth-century European or American calling a doctor, or a twentieth-century man calling a doctor, are all on an equal footing, rational both in belief (which is never ioo per cent, by the way), and in action. This, from the viewpoint of sociological explanation. From the viewpoint of medical efficacy, clearly, matters differ. The African witch-doctor is almost innocuous, at times harmful, and seldom of use, except in very special cases. The doctor of the Age of Reason, on current assessment, was a real killer, and even going to a late nineteenth-century doctor was not a factor which improved the patient's chances for recovery. Current assessment 240</page><page sequence="6">J. Agassi and L. C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again is that only after Pasteur and Lister did doctors start doing more good than harm. This leads to another problem: why did people persist with useless and worse than useless doctors? This is again a sociological question, but statable only after taking into account our superior medical know- ledge--on the assumption that it is superior. We have, in our paper, explained only the persistence of the witch-doctor. The doctor of the Age of Reason is another kettle of fish, and a very transient one; one of us has dealt with him applying the same theory in another place.5 Back to Beattie. What we find him struggling with is two theories, both of which he accepts as obvious-and we join him-and which seemingly conflict: the one which sees the faith in the witch-doctor as rational, the other which does not. We understand him as wishing to square matters by viewing the pre-literate man's faith in witch-doctors not as practical or proto-scientific, but as symbolically expressive. We find this both digressive and quite redundant: he only has to see that there are two standards of rational belief here, that's all. (Our view, but not his, applies to the Age of Reason too.) We had a section on Frazer, and Beattie corrects what he considers some misrepresentations of Frazer's views. Since the section merely acknowledged an intellectual debt, we permit ourselves to skip de- fending it--especially as one of us has already written extensively on the subject and debated it to boot (p. 177, note). We are tempted to respond to Beattie's schoolmasterly insults (p. 245, lines I1-12 and 17-18), which perhaps we asked for, in the very manner in which we expressed our admiration for Evans-Pritchard.6 Certainly we do agree, as we say, flatly, that Frazer's views require modification (p. I77). Evans-Pritchard, we add (p. 192), has offered us a way. Yet, Evans- Pritchard is one of the writers to whom we allude when we say more modern writers dismiss Frazer's view as all too rational. The subtlety of the matter has eluded our wording. If magic is proto- science, then, according to Evans-Pritchard, and Beattie follows him in this, it is less rational than if it is symbolic expression. But if magic is proto-science, then, in another sense it is more rational as well. We have failed to make this clear and so our wording may be open to Beattie's attack. Once Beattie has launched one insult (we 'seem either not to have read or not to have understood' Evans-Pritchard's classic paper which we dissent from) (p. 245), he gets the habit, forgetting his remark about 'this in many respects fruitful dialogue' (p. 241 note), and speaks of our 'diverting but doubtfully useful exercise of setting up and then attacking a position never held by anybody' (p. 245). Of our observation that anthropologists today regard 'the ridicule of Frazer as a pleasant pastime' (p. I77) he says, we seem unable to distinguish ridicule from criticism' (p. 246); and as to our field observation that anthropologists 241</page><page sequence="7">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again regard ridiculing Frazer as 'a pleasant pastime and commendable ritual' (p. I77), he fails to discuss ridicule even though by his own definition of ritual (symbolic expression of a socially significant notion) this surely is a ritual-even if it may not have a magico-religious component (we leave this open) (p. 241)-and it has not yet 'degener- ated into "empty ceremonial" ' either (p. 242). We cannot complain about insults and oversights-we did not treat Beattie very well; and anyway he is merely parrying our attack. Yet neither niceties nor priorities matter half as much as the truth. What matters is that Beattie's view, as expressed now, is agreeable to us: judged by local standards magic is rational. He claims this view to be trivially true and not worth an essay (such as ours); this is quite all right too. We, too, think the thesis trivially true. We also said that Beattie's insistence on the social meaning of magic ritual is rooted in an error. His error, we said, is the unwillingness to explain an act as rational by making its rationality depend on an error (such as the theory of magic which is accepted in the magician's society). We are unjust to him, he says. His insistence on the social meaning of magic comes to explain the persistence of an error, not rationality. This, then, is Beattie's second point: here at last we see what he wants to see explained: the stability of magic. Would that we could agree with him about the cause of the persis- tence of the error of magic. But we prefer to agree with his teacher Evans-Pritchard who saw the persistence and stability of magic in its being a smooth and sophisticated world view which offers tools for explaining every phenomenon (p. 192). As Evans-Pritchard said in his celebrated introductory lectures,7 magic has this in common with communism (both also have show trials). The quality of smoothness, we echoed Evans-Pritchard, magic shares with other, non-magic, modern views. In our own day, we added, this quality seems to be losing its attraction (p. 192 note). Let us hope so. All this leaves quite a bit of tangle untouched. We hope it can be left there. Whatever the significance of symbolism, whatever the cause of the persistence of magic, and regardless of history, it is nice to know that we and Beattie all agree that people call the witch-doctor because they believe in the efficacy of his magic, etc. Whether other scholars also believe this or not is a matter of much library work; Professor Beattie speaks of a few classic works, including a work by Fortes, as in agree- ment with this. Now, every student of anthropology knows that Fortes is one of those who explicitly prefers explaining magico-religious rites functionally even though he admits-rather reluctantly-that they are accompanied by certain beliefs. The beliefs, Fortes implies, are gratui- tous. We find Fortes' pseudo-Freudian interpretation of the social significance of the Tallensi rites quite arbitrary, and we find most of the functionalist literature on this topic arbitrary even by the loose standards 242</page><page sequence="8">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again accepted in psychology (normal or abnormal). Beattie, however, thinks this literature far from arbitrary as 'even the most superficial study of any of the works listed in note 4 on pages 245-6 above would amply demonstrate' (p. 251 note)-from which it follows, of course, as an immediate corollary, that we have not studied them even superficially. And he thinks they explain the persistence of the magical beliefs. We think they do not explain the persistence of the beliefs, but rather render them insignificant.8 Our judgment here is both a matter of reading texts and of evaluating them as scientific explanations. Beattie finds our reading of the texts faulty, and our views on scientific method so unserious, because idio- syncratic (p. 253, line 17), that perhaps 'further discourse becomes impossible'. Now, notice, it is not a magician's socially accepted view, but two critics' idiosyncratic views, which are deemed irrational: the magician's position is rational as he belongs and to the extent that he belongs to a magic-minded group; hence, that of two idiosyncratic critics, magic-minded or not, must be quite different! This is consistent with our previous presentation. We must, therefore, revise it. We distinguished previously two kinds of rationality, when we should have distinguished three. We spoke of (I) weak rationality, per- taining to an action as explained by given goals, and (2) strong rationality, pertaining only to goal-directed actions based on beliefs held to be rational by some standard. Let us now split this second category carefully and divide strong rationality into (2a) relatively strong rationality where the standard of rationality evoked is that of one's own community, and (2b) very strong rationality, which pertains to the highest standards of rationality known anywhere, to wit (we say) those of critical thinking (this should satisfy Beattie's note on p. 256). To take Gellner's example,9 when Bolyai starts believing in non- Euclidean geometry in some sense he is a deviant-though it is rather ridiculous to brand him so. He does reject the accepted norms and standards of his community; he may even be penalized by public opinion. Now, of course, he is in a better sense (2b) the most rational of his community, and even by the standards (of critical thinking) en- dorsed by his peers. What happens here is, of course, that some of his peers are uncritical-knowingly or not-some hold inconsistent stan- dards, etc. All this at times occurs even among pre-literates; though, generally, they could benefit from more critical thinking. Beattie has a bitter complaint. We poked gentle (less gentle than we intended) fun at his observation that pre-literate people have no capacity for systematic analytic thinking. He says (pp. 252-3, note) that we and only we have misunderstood him, and he quotes himself: 'The capacity for systematic analytic thinking about concepts [italics added [by Beattie]] is a product of several millennia of education and conscious philosophizing'. He does not see how much more fun can be 243</page><page sequence="9">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again poked at this, obviously rather ponderous observation, intended to state the obviously true and managing to include a few howlers. What on earth is 'the capacity for systematic analytic thinking about concepts' ? Who thinks about concepts and how is this brought about by education and philosophy? How many philosophers does Beattie think have the capacity for systematic analytic thinking about concepts ? Shall we tell him that the first systematic thinking about concepts was Frege's, less than a century ago, which was terribly elementary, exposing errors and confusions not all of which have been cleared up yet, and that Frege was penalized by public opinion for his pioneering effort ? What does Beattie think he is talking about ? What does he think he is saying ? We suggest his pronouncement was a ritual invocation of Oxford philosophy- magic, and no one takes literally his symbolic expression of a socially significant notion except the two of us. We confess we find his complaint ;ust a bit too facile. We must, then, return to scientific method proper, and forget about systematic analytic thinking-about concepts or about cramps. Let us return to Beattie's restatement of his thesis: magic is not proto-science. Alas! He has not defined proto-science for us. But what matters whether magic is or is not proto-science? We have been told what magic is. What is science then? Science, says Beattie, as everyone knows, is the making and testing of hypotheses (p. 253-4). How nice. The current philosophical literature is filled with discussion of the subject, but for Beattie there is no problem here. There are other oddities. He seems to feel that testing is confirming. He does not say whether a refuted theory is scientific or not-very important, as we shall see. Also, on one essential issue he is more indignant than clear. Is science a matter of cranking a machine (rational or scientific thought processes), or is it more like symbolism and analogy? Beattie thinks the latter pertain to magic, religion, and art only, and differ 'in some important and obvious respects from' the former, the 'intellectual procedures' involved in science procedures. Which only shows his ignorance of the literature on the nature of science, on which topic he pronounces so confidently. We were trying to bring home to anthro- pologists that current discussions of magic-unlike those of Frazer's day-are out of date. Not out of date anthropology, but out of date philosophy of science, namely inductivism. That which seems trivial, obvious, even common sense in Oxford common rooms, frequently turns out to be out-of-date science and philosophy. Beattie asks us rhetorically (p. 254, note I) how something that works can be judged false. This is instrumentalism-another out-of-date philosophy of science widely espoused, unnoticed and hence uncriticized, at Oxford and elsewhere. (Query: can Oxford ever be idiosyncratic?) We should not take all this too seriously; ritual gestures need not symbolize, we have agreed. We say that magic is false theory, no more 244</page><page sequence="10">J. Agassi and L C. Jarvie Magic and rationality again no less. This makes it science par excellence-Popper often says we are only sure a theory is empirical and scientific after it has been falsified. But once better science has been discovered, false science can at best be relatively strongly rational. The superiority of very strongly rational science turns on this: understanding both magic and science as we do, we will choose science because it is better testable, explains more, more precisely, etc.-that is, we do not like the smoothness of magic.10 Philo- sophers of science readily see a continuous development between meta- physics, myths and such like, through anthropomorphism and magic, to current science. Thought-processes of all conceivable kinds (intuition, analogy, model, symbolism, deduction) are thought to be involved in the development of science (and there is no 'procedure' here). Actions intellectualistically chopped up into scientific or practical components, and to symbolic or expressive and nonpractical components are wrongly chopped up to begin with, quite apart from the distortion any chopping introduces. On the occasions Beattie grasps this, he seems to think it is too obvious to labour. Yet, again and again, he fails to cotton on. We also think it obvious, yet we find it interesting to try and develop our views without violating its truth. That is why we said, after stating the problem and solving it, that there were more serious problems about magic to be discussed. We fail to understand why Beattie calls this an 'egregious' non-sequitur and turns with 'relief' to Lukes' paper. What- ever happened to the spirit of this 'in many respects fruitful dialogue'?
