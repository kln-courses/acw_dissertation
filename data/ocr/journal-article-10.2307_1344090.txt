The Mont Sainte-Victoire works produced in the last four years of Cezanne's life were realized in watercolor and pencil and oils. These final works charge forward and open out, or open up, to a certain furious animation of surface-a surface ruptured with a pulsation of marks that tend not so much to elide as to ignore the code of resemblance; see, for example, Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from Les Lauves (fig. 1); or the work from the same series in the Kunstmuseum in Basel. It is as though such marks and such a surface were generating a space that was moving into a differ- ent, yet-to-be-named space, one that hovered at the edge of resemblance. Formed of a sediment of touches, this space and these marks lift into the rush of a charged field of forces. What name is there for this so-called sky that transmutes with so little transition into this so-called mountain? What name is there for this faceted skein of marks that fall now like a veil and now like a wall below a horizon that is itself permeable to a surge and flow between top and bottom, not to mention the suggestion of far as near Robert Morris is an artist who occasionally writes. His collection of essays, Continuous Project, Altered Daily, appeared in 1994. His "Profes- sional Rules" appeared in Critical Inquiry (Winter 1997).</page><page sequence="3">816 Robert Morris Cezanne's Mountains and near as far? What name is there for this hallucinated compression of the proximal and the distal that would tilt up a space not so much every- where equidistant to vision as one converted/confined/released/bound over to an oxymoronic zone of a haptic coloration? What sort of space has the capacity to both hover and yet anchor itself to a surface? (Surely that grotesque, clanking grid leaning in the art historical corner is a far too rusty and Procrustean bed on which to stretch these works.) To say that somewhere in the tangle of blues and bare canvas, or the greens of a dragged brush, the hand was opening on the very brink of releasing a world of resemblance, a resemblance by which a world was still held, but one that adhered by no more than the mere friction of touch, may be to misconstrue and misdescribe these works that seem to fall between the codes of the abstract and the representational. Before us we see a welter of touches of color that are densely material yet aerial, spaced and hovering yet grounded. A threatening, destabiliz- ing translucency lurks at the edge of solidity in these works. The water- color and pencil sketches of Mont Sainte-Victoire seem suspended in the air itself. The transparent purples and greens and pinks of the watercol- ors shimmer and float, yet seal themselves to the opened whiteness of the page in diaphanous undulations. The rhythms of these marks are both awkward and serene, and resonate more to the body's registration of a dry summer heat, or peripheral visual sensations of the shudder of vegetation stirred by a hot breeze, than to optical signs whose ambition is to repre- sent leaves on trees (see the watercolor Mont Sainte- Victoire Seen from Les Lauves [1902-6], in the Museum of Modern Art). The oils pulsate with half a dozen hues of blue, greens, and purples run from near blackness to a high-keyed transparency erupting upward to invade the space of a nominal sky, which in turn descends with touches of ultramarine to spike the bottom edge of the rectangle. The ochers, shimmering as though still retaining the radiant heat of the summer earth from which they were ground, thread their way through the thick- ets of greens and purples. Somehow a certain equanimity restrains the stress of forces distributed across these surfaces. Wittgenstein's remark that "we predicate of the thing what lies in the method of representing it" brings us close to our problem (failure?) of representing what these works represent as representations.' If our ur- gency for a description is irrelevant to the activity that engaged C6zanne in producing the works, we nevertheless have an object before us that should, we think, submit itself to description. But we flounder in the metaphysics of identity in our descriptions. Identities in these works be- gin to implode in this field of ruptured, virtual objects (sky/sky? moun- tain/mountain? ground/ground?) that exchange forces with one another. 1. Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (New York, 1953), ? 104; hereafter abbreviated PI.</page><page sequence="4">Critical Inquiry Spring 1998 817 These last works reek with a sense of bursting renewal squeezed in the grip of finality. That they show more than can be said we readily admit; that they admit more than can readily be seen allows us to wedge the foot of a word in their doorway. But what does the attempted preci- sion of our descriptions have to do with getting in the doorway? Witt- genstein asks, "Is it always an advantage to replace an indistinct picture by a sharp one? Isn't the indistinct one often exactly what we need?" (PI, ?71). I want to ask in what ways these works might be tied to the world beyond the code of resemblance. I might begin by suggesting that these works perhaps less represent than recall the world. Here I immediately fall into difficulty. A recalling does not fall outside, or even beyond, a representing. A recalling surely assumes a representing and flows from it. But in the case of the works under question I want to ask about such a recalling as a "re-calling" of what might be meant, what might have been attempted, in such a renaming, in such a repositioning of art-making to the world. That is to say I want to ask what are the terms, the implications and the consequences, and the shifts of meanings, amounting to a recod- ing of painting, that these works hold. To ask this is to ask, What is being reflected from them as the mirror of resemblance is perhaps dimmed? What sort of optics are being put in place of a mirrorlike surface, and how are the traces of the world encoded under such a regime? What are the assumptions and strategies of such a realignment, and how was this re-calling staged? On one level such a re-calling revolves around a retrieving, a revis- iting, of C6zanne's early childhood memories tied to certain sites around Aix. C6zanne's motifs embody such revisitings. The effort of redemption addressed to this deep nostalgia constitutes a charged psychological struggle within the work. Mnemosyne haunts the sites Cezanne repeat- edly revisited at the end of his life. A lost innocence locked within child- hood memory saturated these silent woods and quarries, ponds and mountain. But what was sought was not a primitive or edenic return to the innocence of nostalgia but a confrontation with the loss that memory, history, and change inscribe on the psyche. The issue of memory for C6- zanne becomes the challenge of transfiguration forged in those confron- tations with his charged sites. How is this loss to be redeemed through art-that mode which possesses the possibility of defeating loss? By, I want to say, representing memory's loss. And I do not mean the loss of memory, but the representation of memory's ravages of the psyche by means of metaphor. It would seem that all art, in its enduring stasis, seeks to defeat time, the very condition that allows for its production. Yet how do we account for the acknowledgement of time in these works? It is a breathing stillness in these late works that encodes the acknowledgement of time. Such pul- sations do not so much seek to defeat time as to find a metaphor for it,</page><page sequence="5">818 Robert Morris Cezanne's Mountains as though they made the distinction between temporality, as the condi- tion of life, and stasis, its antithesis in death. I want to suggest that such pulsations themselves, materially embodied in the work as the orches- trated spacings of the touches of its facture, duplicate as encoded ana- logue or metaphor vision's fixations of interest, registered as a set of traversing and probing foci. I would argue that one axis of the work, involving as it does the distillation of embodied visuality-its temporally bound penetrations and traverses of space-into a static analogue, the painted image, amounts to a code, one that exceeds that of resemblance. The reading of this code demands a recognition of the work's reen- actment of a particular visual address characterized not only by phenom- enological metaphors but, as we shall see, the apprehension of further philosophical attitudes toward the world. Is the security of the child tied to property rights? In the beginning the child's property is confined to the intimate regions of its body, the parent, and what lies within arm's reach. Its world is devoid of the ex- tended concerns of property as nationalism or real estate values. The world at large is a looming presence saturated with questions. Children are privileged to ask questions that otherwise only the sages confront: what is time, what is space, why is there something and not nothing? Do I want to suggest that one of the things "represented" in C6zanne's late works is a certain childlike breathlessness-that awe fixated on its charged spaces and places? Don't these late works project an openness to those haunted and looming vibrations of the world arriving as charged places? I am suggesting that these motifs are held as transfixing, ques- tioning sites, sites that question the artist, sites that, having remained waiting for him since childhood, interrogated his life as a kind of paren- thesis lived between those earliest and latest encounters. Such sites, in their unchanging stasis, called his changes to account and mocked his mortality. Simultaneously, and from the other side-from the bodily side, or the side of the body inhabiting its living time and space as opposed to that of memory, but nevertheless impelled and compelled by memory's psychic charge-there is also embodied in these works a re-calling or re- naming of a complex set of mediated relations that could only have issued from a lifetime of preparation. These mediated relations are those of art- making, which Cezanne re-called and renamed. In this re-calling and renaming we pass from issues of representation that revolve around the redemption of memory into those that border on a double nausea. On the one hand, we have a nausea of consciousness confronting the body divided within itself-that is to say, divided between the space that informs vision, or vision's capacity to occupy space, and the body's limited capacity for physical movement. On the other hand, we have the greater nausea on the far side of this-the sense of that abyss that marks off the divide between the organic and finite and the inorganic and infinite. Such</page><page sequence="6">Critical Inquiry Spring 1998 819 a greater nausea emerges from the acknowledgement of this dualistic on- tology that foregrounds the pathos of the organic and finite body pitted against the inorganic and infinite: the looming of the enduring world (as "motif") bearing down on the temporary flesh. It is to the first nausea that I first want to turn. I would dismantle what appears perhaps innocuous and seamless in this route from seeing to making. I want to see the discontinuity, the gulf (and here we would find the nausea) between vision's mobility and the body's limited motions. I would mark that difference between vision's effortless penetrations and the limit of the arm's reach. I would fix here that terror between the eye's traverse of the horizon and the torpidity and confinement of every bodily action. I would stress the abyss between the weightlessness of sight and the mortal heaviness of the flesh. And this is to suggest that the sense of capacity bound to a visual gestalt is contradicted by an awareness of the lack of somatic mastery-that site of the mirror stage so famously crucial to Lacan's explications of the infant's exaltation and rage-which is never grown out of, never entirely overcome. It is also to suggest that Cezanne's late landscapes establish a metaphor for the acknowledgement of this abyss. For the exaltation in these works also opens, in every hovering touch, in every dragged stroke of the brush, in every centimeter of para- lyzed hesitation as bare canvas, to the admission of the body's despair and incompleteness before the grandeur of the motif. The very collapse of the representational convention of perspectival distance into a code that compresses the distal and the proximal in favor of the latter, as though the world had been restated in favor of touch over vision, reveals a pathos and a longing for a world that would be more at hand, less traumatized by vision's imperial totalities. But such struggles of realignment inevitably awaken the second nau- sea, which is bound to an ontological dualism: the infinities of inorganic sky and mountain mocking the infirmities of organic and finite body and its promise of rot as destiny. The mountain itself, the one individuated feature in these works, embodies the enduring and unmovable; it ema- nates geological time. The eye's effortless perception of light masks the sight of an unacknowledged wound. Transitive in its directed gaze, vi- sion's intransitive receptivity marks a bodily penetration. The shaft of light is absorbed by the heavy, shuddering flesh. And in this wounding the dance of photons also announces the death of the eye. Cezanne's task was to forge a negotiation between these incommensurables, these dual nauseas. I want also to suggest that these nauseas themselves were framed by an attitude of mourning, that the paintings were monuments of mourn- ing for the intimation Cezanne had that his motifs were themselves threatened. Such a mourning was for a world on the brink of passing. If these sacred sites were informed by the inorganic and the infinite, they were nonetheless threatened by the ravages of so-called progress. C&amp;-</page><page sequence="7">820 Robert Morris Cizanne's Mountains zanne's letters attest to his despair at modernity's technological advances, which were at the beginning of the century already converting nature into a commodity. Many of his motifs that had waited a lifetime for him would pass with him. The route (always bordering on the threat of a rout) of art-making might be mapped as a passage from or through or between a set of condi- tions that are asymmetrical, nonreciprocating, and directional. The con- tour of these always unstable, always to be renegotiated relations might be described as a profile that moves across and through the body inter- sected by space and time. The process begins with a seeing that traverses space, fixated at the site of the responding body that negotiates its limited space of movements as it condenses these into the gesture of a hand that mediates a medium that terminates in, is stopped at, is precipitated into an object which is also an image and an accretion that we cannot yet say with any confidence what it is a complete record of, nor yet mark all of the ways it comes to anchor itself to the world as a "representation"-not to mention what or how certain embodiments, analogues, metaphors, and processes, and still other tropes saturating these marks, might consti- tute ties to the world that lie beyond what can be called, with any confi- dence, the representational. We begin then to attempt a re-calling and/or a renaming, that is to say, to attempt to follow or rather open up C6zanne's re-calling and re- naming of the art-making that informs these late landscapes, thinking predominantly of the great series of Mont Sainte-Victoire works. A hierarchy suggests itself in the form of yet another negotiated dual- ism between light and flesh, body and world, self and object, intention and action, event and object. This one splits into a dualism in which the image comes last spatially and temporally as an accretion of gestures, of touches that fall between the hesitant and the sure-touching as a kind of pointing registered on, I want to say, less the painting, as such, than a redefining of the body's hovering, transfixed as it were, between its own physical space and that of a visual space belonging more properly to the world. From the body's limit arises a pathos of gestures toward acknowl- edging that nausea delivered by the visual from which it is prohibited to inhabit as a motion, say of flight, that would perhaps approximate vision's thrust and penetration of space. This contradiction between the body's space and that of vision finds its pathos in the modality of painting where the two spaces, that of the body and that of the eye, are transfigured by C6zanne in such a way that the one comes to reflect the other as one set of dimensions might be mirrored, as well as mired, caught, secured in the most unstable of ways, in the other. And here the reflection, the mir- roring, is not particularly intelligible as a "representation," for it has be- come rather the record of a deposit of bodily gestures materially embodied as touches that are themselves transcriptions of the difference between two spaces that, in their marks upon the white rectangle, forge</page><page sequence="8">Critical Inquiry Spring 1998 821 a code for a nonexistent space in which there is neither, properly speak- ing, the proximal nor the distal and at the same time a compression of these two into such a code that favors the former, as upon a kind of tablet of death rather than a pictorial representation: a re-calling and a renam- ing of what and how painting stands to the world, or of how it stood to his or how his stood to it. Must we not then seek to rename this process of art-making and its object, a renaming that would traverse-as we might expect in a force that nowhere presents singularity as a modality-a certain doubling, a sense of pulsating duality? The twin axes of the paired terms of algo- rithm/anagoge suggest themselves as pointing toward C6zanne's tran- scriptive method and its horizon of consequences. The origin of the algorithmic axis is to be traced along the asymmet- rical encounter between seeing and acting. The anagogical emerges in that totality, the route to which unflinchingly holds open to the very end the conflicts of this negotiation. The asymmetries of the alternating, reciprocal relation of the living moment of eye movement and the responding bodily movement become aligned, condensed, and concentrated at the end of the hand as a particu- lar kind of signal, a signaling that is at once a compressed gesture, or the gesture a signaling (a kind of algorithmic calculating?), a signifying that acknowledges the confined space between the body and flat canvas as well as that pathos between eye and world. What is mystical, anagogical, is the nature of the transcriptive encod- ing wrested from the visual world via the limitations of the body: a com- pressive space encoded on the canvas echoing that very compression of vision coursing the fleshy conduit between eye and bodily motion. If this compression is partly a pathos, a loss, issuing from the body and the flesh that mourns vision's flight, it is also a celebration, an Aufhebung, of what one wants to call a visuality that issues from the hand, as it were. If this compressive traverse from vision to a termination in the touch of the brush, from vision's depth to its coded mapping on a flat surface, frames the algorithmic axis as a transcoding of the distances of looking by which the world is accessed, we need to also look at the distances looked at in these late landscapes. And such looking at a distance needs to be looked at close up, as it were. For like everything in these works, it encodes a doubled, uncoupled modality. Celebrating the eye's penetrations and traverses of space that would refuse a possessive, consuming focus, the Mont Sainte-Victoire works unfold as a mediated, transposed coruscation of limpid signifiers drained of singular identities (other than the looming, vaguely contoured mountain)-an equivalence bestowed by light itself. The body wanted to follow this play of serene vibration across what is given to vision by the only means available to the painter, the shudder of touch. A touch that also offered protest across the looming antilight of that sullen white ab-</page><page sequence="9">822 Robert Morris Cezanne's Mountains sence, the blank page or canvas. In C6zanne's last works even this anti- light is given its due; not every point on that surface whose blankness is not only absence but denial is covered. If these spaces of absence acknowl- edge the impossibility of finish, they also acknowledge that unbridgeable distance between vision's seamlessness and that abyss between the body's intentions and actions. If such gaps of blank paper or canvas are them- selves semiotic marks that encode this split, they signify as well the im- possibility of representation issuing from the lived body as a seamless signifier of full presence. I want to suggest that C6zanne's looking at his motifs, first experi- enced in the first decade of his life and revisited in the last, was a rede- fined gaze directed into and across the world without desire-that is to say, without the desire that stumbles in such a fervid and febrile way across so much of his work before the turn of the century. Call this another re-calling of desire, a desire re-called partly by the re-calling of the painting itself as a tablet of death. The desire to touch the world without possessiveness can be a kind of release of desire, a touch that is also a farewell, and a kind of mourning as well as a praise of earth and sky. Here the signaling of the hand to the white rectangular tablet deposits a mark that, falling between a gesture of hesitancy and assurance, registers a seeking shorn of all previous codes of mastery. Here also is the site of a deadly combat to subdue and wrest from other deaths-emblematized by those nonwhite tablets of the past, his own as well as all the others, those dead tablets painted to death, stinking of dead art-that would elude death by eluding desire. In these late works the desire of the body has been sacrificed to a form of restraint that would acknowledge not only the body's withdrawal from the world but its anticipated absence from a world that continues to endure. How can we see ourselves breath- ing our last breaths as a breathing along with a world we must both sur- render and surrender to? is a question raised by these last works. These late works embody a breathing that is also a seeing-a seeing that has given up its orality, a looking no longer attached to either projections of anthropomorphic desire or a relentless consumption registered as a mas- tery informing that production. Half a century ago I stood on a rocky Missouri hillside beneath a heavy canopy of oaks and persimmons and massive walnuts in humid July heat daubing greens and blues at a flimsy canvas on a rickety easel, attempting to limn a patch of a stucco house half hidden within dense vegetation. Sweat ran down my shirt as I thought of the Chateau noir shimmering in its greens and ochers. On that day, in that throbbing heat, the spaces between me and the world had yet to be measured; I had yet to assess the world's spaces and those of my body; I had yet to risk my movement within and against the spaces of the world; I had yet to mea- sure my margins of mobility against the weight of history. Being as green</page><page sequence="10">Critical Inquiry Spring 1998 823 as the summer landscape, I was also as empty as the sky of those future clouds that would demand redemption in the midst of ambition. On that sweltering Missouri late afternoon summer day, nothing interrupted the innocence of a sensed awkwardness. There was only a ringing anxiety, a desperate insecurity, and a frightening sense of absence. And if the power of C6zanne stirred my hand, it was a power that was too old for me and one I could not grasp, one that youth could not touch, for I had at such a time no nostalgia to redeem, and my quiet spaces of childhood had yet to be demolished by the world and my own desire. Loss and mourning and grief were mine yet to discover, as was the surrender of desire. Death had not yet made its more formal appearances, and so I could not see it acknowledged as well as subdued there beneath the flurry of brush strokes vibrating within the rectangle on the wall of the Nelson Gallery in Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from Les Lauves (1904-6). Do I want to assert that when I first saw Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from Les Lauves as a child, transfixed by it in September 1939, I did not take its tripartite divisions for a representation of sky, mountain, and an area that was not so much foreground or background as neither and both? Or do I want to assert that what was once taken as a representation has some- how, in ways not clear, but surely ways that have to do with me, with my changes over nearly six decades, come to alter what I take to be a representation? As C6zanne's motifs waited for him for half a century, this work has waited for me for over half a century, waited for certain deaths in me, as well as near me, before I could see it in its fullness. Only after a sufficient set of losses and griefs could it come forward and rereveal itself in my re-call of it, in my rereading of it. Only now can I hear its silences as a mourning for what was passing, a mourning from Cezanne that was also an acceptance on the deepest level of passing as our condi- tion, a passing that in passing, nearly at the last minute, or at least in the last hours and last years, finds in the privilege of vision and light an ex- cess of fullness, a fullness that overruns and outdistances the pace of body, mind, and hand to transpose its energy into an artifact that struggles to register, in our necessary hesitations and doubts, a certain reflection that would present solidity in place of the ringing light and some degree of grace in the face of the infinity of the inanimate. It is in these struggles to reflect that the work comes to rest, if it can be said to come to rest at all, as an address to a representation of an affirmation and a mourning that lies beyond resemblance. 2 We are confronted in C6zanne's Mont Sainte-Victoire works and in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations with a series of something like landscapes, perhaps landscapes as metaphors. In the case of the former</page><page sequence="11">824 Robert Morris Cezanne's Mountains these return again and again to the "motif." The terrain crisscrossed by Wittgenstein in his sets of remarks in the Philosophical Investigations resem- bles, as he remarked, a series of sketches that moved this way and that over the nature of language and how we use and misuse it, how we find our bearings in it and how we become lost in it. ("Language is a labyrinth of paths. You approach from one side and know your way about; you approach the same place from another side and no longer know your way about" [PI, ?203].) C6zanne crisscrossed the terrain at the foot of Mont Sainte-Victoire, now from one side and now from another. The reitera- tion of the motif of the mountain serves to return him again and again to his encounter with the question of the space of vision and its relation to the body. The worlds of Wittgenstein and C6zanne hover on the edge of doubts that demanded endless reinscriptions traversing the very edges of these doubts. Neither ends in the despair of skepticism, but neither de- nies its persistent presence. The traverse of these respective landscapes, demanding a multitude of gestures on the part of C6zanne and a long series of remarks on the part of Wittgenstein, proceeded with a certain spacing. With Wittgenstein it is a certain set of questions that approach now from this side and now from that, and the repetitive reinscriptions of these remarks come to take on what we might call a kind of verbal pentimento. The text begins to take on the character of a palimpsest in which the crossed-out lines of doubt are nevertheless visible through and beneath later repetitions or visitations to the same site. I am impelled to find in the late works of C6zanne a parallel in the character of his marks, those animated deposits of spaced colors. And the parallel with Witt- genstein is in the spaces of uncovered canvas, a holding off of finish by which we read the implied or unsaid acknowledgement of the possibility of doubt rather than the expression of it. These works refrain themselves from that finish that would "ground" them in the solidity of representa- tion as resemblance in ways that recall how Wittgenstein refuses a seam- less, finished text on the one hand, and on the other, refuses to ground language and our ways of knowing and acting on anything more than the communal practices of those forms of life in which he finds them. In reply to Bertrand Russell's claim that skepticism was "practically barren" though "logically irrefutable," Wittgenstein countered that "skepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously ;ionsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked. For doubt can exist only where a question exists, a question only where an answer exists, and an answer only where something can be said."2 Stanley Cavell has argued that Wittgenstein in the Investigations re- peatedly acknowledges the necessary possibility of skepticism while with- 2. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, trans. D. E Pears and B. E McGuinness (London, 1961), ?6.51</page><page sequence="12">Critical Inquiry Spring 1998 825 holding any direct answer, which would put too much flesh on the bones of this ageless, hovering ghost.3 Others, such as Saul Kripke, find Witt- genstein's tormented circling around the question of what it is to follow a rule a much closer encounter with Humean specters.4 Thomas Nagel has suggested that Wittgenstein's position was that if doubts "are expressible, they must be wrong."5 This is not the place to review Wittgenstein's pri- vate language argument, which leads to his subtle considerations of crite- ria and rule following, the consequences of which go deep into the nature of what we can call upon for justifications in our linguistic behavior, our beliefs and actions. Skepticism makes its appearance in these considera- tions when we ask for an objectivity that extends beyond use. Our craving for generality and scientific-type explanations leads us into metaphysics, where we posit mistakes that bring us to the brink of skepticism. Witt- genstein did not so much answer the skeptic as show that his questions were incoherent. But in his efforts to build a "wall at the end of language" that would exclude incoherent questions, he seems to have tunneled un- der language into an unstable space. There he found missing those objec- tive supports we thought justified our procedures. As Nagel puts it, "We are left with nothing but my successive applications of a term, without any- thing to compare them with that can count as the rule for its applica- tion-the criterion that determines whether I have applied it correctly in each case."6 If skepticism can be the consequence of interpreting rules rather than following them blindly, and if our court of last appeal is to a kind of custom in which we will not so much discover our justifications as that pause where we can say with Wittgenstein, "if I have exhausted the justi- fications I have reached bedrock, and my spade is turned. Then I am inclined to say: 'This is simply what I do"' (PI, ?217). Here we might as well admit that a certain hauntedness will forever hover over all our ef- forts to give justifying reasons and that it is when we venture out to the edge of these, half a step from doubt, where hesitation precedes our touch, that we can draw those breaths with which we form the only words that will ever be our own, and these will very likely take the form of ques- tions as much as statements, or, given the way the world works, be taken by us as questions and by others as statements. I would suggest that a proceeding by questioning rather than doubting informs the Mont Sainte-Victoire works in a way parallel to how Wittgenstein came to ask himself questions as a way of doing philosophy. Other philosophers, such as W. V. O. Quine and Donald Davidson, 3. See Stanley Cavell's discussion in "Knowing and Acknowledging," The Cavell Reader, ed.

Ibid., p. 52.</page><page sequence="13">826 Robert Morris CUzanne's Mountains would perhaps find Wittgenstein's obsession with the normativity of rules a symptom of one of those linguistic "cramps" Wittgenstein so famously sought to undo. For Davidson, the notion of a rule merely implies a pre- supposition of language rather than any explanation of it.' Davidson wants to give up the assumption that language must "operate on the basis of shared conventions, rules, or regularities." Starting from a second- person perspective that finds interpretation central and subjectivist ac- counts of less interest, Davidson asserts that it is in the generation of "passing theories" directed toward the other and "derived by wit, luck, and wisdom from a private vocabulary and grammar" that we grasp the meaning of the other's words. Rules here are "rules of thumb for figuring out what deviations from the dictionary are most likely." Here skepticism does not haunt the edges of communication, and a sense of play is more significant than doubt.8 These considerations have implications for art. Art is not a language in the sense that its iconic activity can be compared to the linguistic point by point in a semantic and syntactical way. This is not to deny that lan- guage is inextricably imbricated in our access to images any more than images can be excluded from our linguistic usage. But images are not words and making art is not speaking. Making art might be described as a kind of calculating, as well as a questioning, with feelings. But I have digressed into Wittgensteinian issues of normativity and rules and vari- ous subsequent thinkers' responses as a prelude to and a framing of my ascription of an algorithmic method to C6zanne's late works, specifically the Mont Sainte-Victoire works. I follow Wittgenstein in seeking no objec- tivity for this algorithmic procedure beyond its use (whatever legislative and logical empowerment it offers, it has no independent, Platonic exis- 7. Both Kripke's and Cavell's interpretations of this issue-each differing to be sure (see Cavell's more or less Austinian critique of Kripke's Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Lan- guage in Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome [Chicago, 1990], pp. 64-100)-hinge on a communitarian reading. But aren't norms and normality constantly being questioned by Wittgenstein? Or is he also attacking them? In any case he is always saying more than one thing in the Investigations. What if rules, rather than explaining anything, are what is to be explained? Rules are best conceived as objects used in particular ways, without any intrinsic properties that make them rules .... This view breaks down the sense of a rule as having a 'form" that makes it identical with itself.., and thus brings out the radical way in which Wittgenstein rejects the classical metaphysics of entity. All of this is ignored when we focus merely on agreement of the community as the determinant of correct rule-following.

C6zanne's algorithmic method does not uniformly guide all of the late works. It is absent from the stilted and inferior Bathers works and does not function in the still lifes. This algo- rithm might be compared to Davidson's notions of a "passing theory"- in this case directed toward interpreting the otherness of space and moving, step by step, across vision to bodily response to coded surface. Unique to the Mont Sainte-Victoire works is the degree to which dis- crete objects are deprived of representation in terms of depicted resem- blance. It is not so much that objects are broken down or deprived of identity by missing outlines and the like. It is more the case that objects in the field of vision are not acknowledged as such, as if they were embed- ded into the field, driven back into it, welded to it so deeply that individu- ation was no longer an issue. The field itself is foregrounded-in front, as it were, of any object within it. Because of this loss of individuation these works have been labeled as laying the groundwork for modernism's code of abstraction. Perhaps they do. But I would argue that a concern for such inchoate abstraction amounts to a misreading of the intentions of the Mont Sainte-Victoire works. I want to re-call this so-called abstract aspect, reinterpret it as a function of the algorithmic procedure-one that has nothing to do with notions either of representation or abstraction that circumscribe present conceptualizations of the limits of art's available codes. The suppression of the cathecting of objects by means of the code of depiction according to resemblance was required by the algorithmic transcription that delivered a third space devoid of distinctions between the proximal and the distal. But it also did more than this. I am suggesting that C6zanne's considerations of painting as a form of life open to a body acting in response to the world was both an in- tensely examined act and an intensely anxious one that was neither in- formed by any frontal address to doubt nor issued in contemplative images of resemblance. The space C6zanne arrived at was an unstable one. In the Mont Sainte-Victoire works, where objects begin to lose their identities, space begins to compress. The feeling induced by these works is both grand and anxious, informed by both dread and relief. It is the feeling of an incipient blindness in which we are about to lose the visual world and its objects and the demands and terrors these inflict on us. This visual world of depth and objects is exchanged for another delivered by means of the haptic algorithm. This landscape becomes an abyss where visual depth darkens into touch, where touch is registered as color, as though touch could read color, as though color was accessed by touch, or as though Mnemosyne herself arrived by the touches of colors. The eliding of objects in favor of touches of color saturating the visual field does not, I would emphasize, indicate evidence for an empiricist position valorizing "sense impressions" over the perception of objects any more</page><page sequence="15">828 Robert Morris Cizanne's Mountains than it theorizes the space of abstraction. The Mont Sainte-Victoire works teeter on a phase change. They stand, as it were, at the entrance to the world shutting down visually, collapsing into the space of blindness where depth is lost to touch, which, in these late works, are the hesitant touches of mourning and farewell. On another level these works can be read as an aggressive, destruc- tive gesture, or rather, such a gesture can be read within the works, aris- ing from C6zanne's despair and anger at the progress of "development" arriving to disrupt and destroy his childhood spaces. The inability to ac- cept the imminent "death" of his motifs led him to want to both touch and symbolically destroy these sites by marking them as blind places, no longer open, closed off to a penetrating visuality. The paintings can be seen as shades in the process of being drawn over that visuality, marking their death, testifying to a mourning, as well as reverberating to an antici- pation of the painter's own death. (Perhaps Ciezanne's diabetic condition should not be discounted here. It is a condition that often threatens sight.) Anxiety rather than doubt has a central place in these works. But such a monumental anger that had no room for skepticism did, as all art always does, leave room for play to the very end. Of course different art- ists play differently. If, in his macho phrase, Picasso (that imperialistic cannibal of images, whose eye was fitted with the sharpest of teeth) asserted a determination to live by the words "I do not search, I find"-a prescient motto that presages an insatiable appetite for a world of commodity consumption of images that might today be spoken with an equal voraciousness by Bill Gates-we must understand here a desire that can never doubt its appe- tite for conquests it would read as progress and an anxiety that would read otherness as mere nonrelation to be obliterated by the annexation of invasion. The world is no longer to be searched, since it has been found, or, rather, there is nothing to be searched for among that array of catalogued commodities as information and information as commodity that totals all its possible divisions. And this totalizing illumination of the known as consumable would, in eliding the darkness of the yet to be found, extend monoculture all the way down to, for example, the genetic sequence-to mention but one of the many modes it would fixate as the found, the fungible, and the marketable. The only identifiable human artifact-the only depiction in terms of resemblance-in many of these late works (for example, Mont Sainte- Victoire Seen from Les Lauves (1904-6; Basel) is the suggestion of architec- ture. In the work cited it is a house. Let us rather say a home, a dwelling. Let us even say a place of being charged with all the longing of Heideg- gerian Heimat. For these works project more than a shimmering and vi- brating anxiety hovering on the edge of destructive self-blinding. They are drenched in longing and loss. If the paintings enact a condemnation of visuality as conquest-a shattering of visuality's mastery as metaphor</page><page sequence="16">Critical Inquiry Spring 1998 829 for that imperial, totalizing objectification ushered in by modernity's We- berian, rationalized, administrated, bureaucratic alienation and prog- ress-by gesturing toward self-blinding, they also seek a redemption and a comforting for the body. They may go so far as to acknowledge the collective guilt that the painter shared by inhabiting the moment of mo- dernity. I believe they even go so far as to touch that state of infantile desire for oneness before vision knows anything of depth perception. There is nothing especially surprising about art-anyway great art-em- bracing the contradictory, elevating and reclaiming the infantile and the repressed, reenacting the terror and fury of primary process, while evi- dencing longing and desires for compensation and redemption. These are frequent impulses beneath art and suggest the inverse or underside of the activity-what the poet Anna Akhmatova perhaps had in mind when she suggested to Joseph Brodsky that all art was built out of trash. What is profound in the Mont Sainte-Victoire works is how the mon- umental rests on and is extended over the unstable, how these artifacts utilize their contradictions and weld them into a grandeur that neverthe- less remains open to revealing the destabilizing fissures of those anxieties that lie at their origins. The very "unfinish" of these works reiterates the refusal of resolution and closure of those conflicts and hesitations that were the conditions of their making-and all art since seems far too fin- ished. The glory of these late works lies in their perpetuation of risk, in their refusal to shut down the contradictions upon which they were built. C6zanne's genius lies in having forged a way of acting at the limits of human tolerance for the contradictory and finding in that struggle a con- nection to the world that had not been made before him and has not been made since. In doing this he extended our sense of possibility by allowing us to inhabit the complex otherness of a space that is anything but a picture of mountains.</page></plain_text>
