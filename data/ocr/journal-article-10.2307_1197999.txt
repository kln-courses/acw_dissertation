<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION A different sampling may show slightly dif- ferent results, but a cursory examination will everywhere reveal the retention of such features as Briticisms (e.g., currency and measure- ments), Latinisms like "charity" (I Corinthians, chap. I3), "quaternions" (Acts I2:4), "publi- cans"; archaisms like "husbandman" (John I5:I), "suffered" (for "allowed"), "poor in spirit" (Matt. 5:3; no note), and many others, including the pronouns and verbal endings; lit- eralisms like "to his own" (John I9:27, etc.), "respect of persons" (Rom. 2:II), "entering into himself" (Luke I5:I7), "kingdom of the heavens," etc. While the Westminster Version contained many improvements over the tradi- tional text (e.g., in Matt. 26:28; Luke 2:14, 35, 49; John I:5; Acts I:4 and 9:36; Rom. 8:28; I Cor. :21; Heb. I: i), much revision still re- mains to be made in the interests of clarity and accuracy. Opportunity is not afforded here of discussing questionable translations and texts. The translators here and there had to hew to tradition as against their better judgment, as is dear from several notes indicating the necessity of conformation to the pronouncements of coun- cils and commissions (e.g., at Mark I6:9-20 and John 7:53-8:1I). Incidentally, the prefatory note to Ephesians indicating the omission of "in Ephesus" in "two" best manuscripts should now read "three" to include the Beatty pa- pyrus, p46. Official viewpoints are, of course, particular- ly apparent in the prefaces and to some extent in the marginalia. The letters of Paul (including Hebrews and the Pastorals) are arranged in sup- posed chronological sequence, a feature which makes reference use difficult at first. Except for the rather small type, the format is very good. ALLEN WIKGREN Federated Theological Faculty University of Chicago The New Testament Doctrine of the Last Things: A Study of Eschatology. By HAROLD A. GUY. New York: Oxford Press, 1948. ix+i89 pages. $3.oo. The author reviews carefully all the impor- tant eschatological passages in the New Testa- ment, interpreting each and relating it to its place in the New Testament literature as a whole. He is one of the increasing number who emphasize the unity of the New Testament. For the most detailed discussion is given to the Synoptic teaching of Jesus. He concludes that eschatology is neither the key to Jesus' teaching nor is it absent from his teaching. Jesus used es- chatological language, but "mainly for purposes of illustration," not in the vein of the apocalyp- tists but of the great prophets, as the "vehicle for permanent spiritual and ethical truth." In dealing with "Early Christian Preaching" -Acts, I Peter, and James- the author finds greater emphasis on eschatology, although much less than do many recent treatments. This greater emphasis is due, he thinks, partly to what he calls a desire to compensate for the ap- parent failure of Jesus in bringing in the king- dom, partly to the inability to forget the old apocalyptic conceptions. Paul had no "con- sistent eschatology." His emphasis "fluctuated between present blessings and future consum- mation." The author has a fine vision of the primarily "ethical" drive of Paul's letters. He- brews reinterprets eschatology in terms rather of "value" than of "time." The New Testament contains almost no information on the nature of the individual's life after death, although this is one of the many questions which interest Christians and to which they vainly try to force an answer from Scripture. Guy has provided one of the best introduc- tions in English to this complicated subject, ex- plaining fairly and with sufficient completeness the pertinent New Testament passages and the main lines of present interpretation. The exposi- tion is unfortunately limited by the utter lack of all use of literature in languages other than Eng- lish. Kiimmel's Verheissung und Erfiillung, to mention a single instance, would have added much to the discussion. Bultman has now writ- ten as fully on Paul and Jesus as in the earlier and translated book on Jesus. Again, it is doubtful whether Guy has fully appreciated the ancient use of figurative lan- guage, especially of metaphor. Details of the story of the rich man and Lazarus are a ques- tionable source of Jesus' ideas on the nature of life after death. There is an unusually apprecia- tive review of the Book of Revelation, showing that author's skill as an artist and his basic in- terest in the main themes of the New Testament and in the religious life of the church. But one wonders whether this deeply religious and skilled writer was as much the slave of his meta- phors as even Guy seems to admit. Jesus came, 3I6</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS is here, or will come-all are true, each in its own sense. The New Testament knows that God's victory is sure and sometimes dates that victory in the cross, sometimes in a coming age. From the point of view of these writers, there is no contradiction. There are numerous tensions between the various ideas of the different au- thors, and these tensions exist even in the phrases of the same author, but there remains a striking unity in the main underlying ideas, and this unity is, after all, what has given the New Testament its unique worth. JOHN W. BEARDSLEE, JR. New Brunswick Thelogical Seminary Prayer in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha: A Study of the Jewish Concept of God. By NORMAN B. JOHNSON. Philadelphia: Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, I948. 77 pages. $i.oo. A man's prayers uncover his beliefs! Some such assumption forms the basis of this careful review of the prayers in the Old Testament Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. By this "in- direct approach to theology ... we catch a man off guard," and, without the distortion of con- scious consistency, his prayers reveal what char- acter he assigns to God. The author pursues three lines of inquiry: (i) What do the Jews pray for? (2) What inducements do they offer God to grant the petitions? (3) What response do they expect from God? The discussion of each section includes a citation of Old Testa- ment usage and a reference to New Testament or rabbinic prayers as abutments for the inter- testamental bridge. I. The aims and objects of Jewish prayer in this period are found to cover a wide range, from help in time of war through the supply of daily needs to righteousness and pure praise. Each goal reflects some aspects of the character of God. 2. Many readers will be startled to see listed among the "Means of Inducing God To Heed the Prayers" "The Appeal to God's Bargaining Instinct" and "An Appeal to God's Love of the Beautiful." And a greater question may be raised as to whether Jesus in Matt. 6:15 recom- mended forgiveness of men as a "reasonable way of gaining [?] forgiveness" from God. 3. Prayers in this period found response in voices, angelic visitation, dreams, or direct ful- filment. The audible voice response suggests an anthropomorphic idea of God, the angelic re- sponse a transcendent God, the dream response a God near at hand. A direct response exerts less control on the concept of God in relation to the world. In drawing his conclusions, the author recog- nizes the range and inconsistency in the Jewish thought about God, and he is content to outline the broader bases of belief. He is aware also of the fact that beyond the record the actual prac- tice of prayer was a living experience of the Jewish people. The deductive method of this monograph yields important results for the Jewish concept of God. The method has been put to very lim- ited use in discovering Jesus' vivid experience of God or the New Testament sense of God's act in the coming of the Kingdom. PAUL E. DAVIES McCormick Theological Seminary Sublimation. By J. TREVOR DAVIES. New York. Macmillan Co., I947. I48 pages. $1.75. Can thwarted persons be both ethical and healthy through sublimation? Dr. Davies surveys various views and con- cludes that neither free expression nor depres- sion is necessary. Inhibition-in other words, suppression or conscious control-is possible and harmless up to a certain point, depending upon the soundness of the individual. Deflec- tion of energy is possible too; deflection into activities that satisfy not only particular in- stincts but the whole self. People must inhibit some instincts at times, and they should deflect the energy into morally desirable, beneficial ac- tivities. In Davies' view, sublimation is such diver- sion of instinctive energy (not more libido) into higher and socially useful processes. It is effect- ed by objective values, through man's devotion to them. Moreover, sublimation may be con- sciously directed; and it may be applied not merely to man's surplus emotional energy but to all his instinctive energy. Thus sublimation is more than a safety valve for superfluous energy. It is also more than a "second-best way." Sub- limation is "as natural as the direct gratification of the instinct"; art, music, learning, and reli- 317</page></plain_text>
