<plain_text><page sequence="1">[RA 84-1990] 33 NOTES ON SOME HORNED BUILDINGS IN IRAN, MESOPOTAMIA AND ARABIA by D. T. Potts In a recent volume of this journal P. Amiet has, with characteristic perspicacity, focused interest on the subject of ancient Iranian buildings decorated with horns.1 The examples to which he has referred are as follows. First, there is a two-tiered Fig. 1. — Late Uruk cylinder seal impression from Susa (Sb 2125) showing a building with three (pairs of) horns emanating from the sides after Amiet, RA 81 (1987) building (fig. 1) with three horns2 emanating from each side of the upper story, shown on a well-known Late Uruk cylinder sealing from Susa.3 Second, an equally well-known relief from Room I of Assurbanipal's palace at Nineveh4 shows a three 1.

This seems reasonable in view of the fact that, in ail other cases with whieh I am familiar the horns of cervids, bovids or ovicaprids are always used in pairs for décorative purposes. 3. P.

Prof. Amiet's article was prompted largely by a recent study of J. Margueron7 in which the identity of the alleged temple platform shown on the Susa sealing was challenged. As for the horns on the building, Margueron did not dispute the traditional belief that these can be interpreted as a mark of divinity,8 an interprétation which, in this particular case, can be traced back to R. de Mecquenem.9 Amiet, on the other hand, is less sure of this point than previously. Indeed, in earlier works, he had accepted the religious significance of the horns,10 though not without some hésitations.11 Such doubts, however, did not surround the interprétation of the horns shown on the Elamite temple, whether or not it is a ziggurat,12 shown on the Nineveh relief.13 As for the depiction of the fortress at Kisesim, Amiet rightly noted that the alleged antlers seem to belong to a différent tradition than that of the horn as a divine symbol.14 Arménien, Kurdistan und Westpersien nach den babylonisch-assyrischen Keilinschriften, ZA 15 (1900), p. 340 342 with full references, to which should be added L.

Amiet, Ziggurats et "Culte en hauteur" des Origines à l'Epoque d'Akkad, BA 47 (1953), p. 28, wrote of the building in the seal-impression, "son caractère d'édifice religieux est indiqué par 6 grandes cornes accrochées aux murs". 11.

Andrae, Altmesopotamische Zikkurat-Darstellungen, MDOG 64 (1926), p. 38, did not beleive that the building shown was meant to be considered a ziggurat, and wrote "der Kiinstler meinte: 'Ein kleiner Bau mit Hôrnerpaaren geschmilckt (vielleicht sogar ein Heiligtum) liegt von drei Ringmauern umgeben auf einem Hiigel. Hier sind aile drei und der Bau inmitten zu sehen!' ". 13.

This seems largely to have gone unnoticed by later scholars, but on examining the KiSesim relief again after reading Billerbeck's description one is struck by the fact that the "antlers" rise</page><page sequence="4">36 D. T. POTTS [RA 84 Rather, they recall the horns attached to the houses of local rulers in Luristan, described by R. de Mecquenem.15 In concluding his study, and returning to the Late Uruk sealing from Susa, Amiet left open the question as to whether the building depicted was a "temple du dieu-patron", along the lines of the Neo-Elamite ziggurat at Susa, or a "résidence du chef ennemi", adorned in the manner of the later tribal lords of Luristan. The subject of horns used for the décoration of religious and secular building is far from exhausted, and it may be useful to provide some additional literary and ethnographie examples which could contribute to the elucidation of the Iranian cases noted already. Although they are surely not unrelated phenomena, divine horn crowns16 and horned altars17 will not be treated here. The dictionnaries, of course, provide an introduction to the subject (s.v. qarnu) and refer to the relevant literary examples. As these are not necessarily well-known to archaeologists interested in the subject, however, and as their applicability to the iconographie study of the extant monuments is not always admitted, it may be worth recalling several of them. The Babylonian epic of création, Enuma élis VI 66, contains a reference to the horns of the Esagila in Babylon,18 and on Cylinder A, Gudea boasts of having raised the horn of the temple of Ningirsu.19 To these literary up out of the towers, and are not attached to them. The possibility that these "antlers" may be flames emanating from the besieged city appears to me highly plausible, and I will therefore not oonsider the Kiâesim relief further in this context. 15.

Amiet has himself drawn attention to a stamp seal impression on pottery from Shahdad, in Kerman province, which shows a rectangle, divided into small squares by two sets of parallel lines, the whole of which is topped by two curving projections.23 This he rightly identified as a crude représentation of a building topped by two horns, comparing it with the Susa, Nineveh, and Khorsabad représen tations referred to above. By far the most vivid ancient allusion to horns on a building, however, is contained in the Rassam Cylinder account of Assurbanipal's sixth campaign against Elam. Here the Assyrian monarch boasts of destroying the ziggurat of Susa, and breaking the horns of shining copper ofï the tower of the temple.24 Although Streck expressed bewilderment at this allusion in his édition of the Assurbanipal texts,25 Th. Dombart had already pointed out in 1915 that a parallel existed between this reference and the image of a temple with two pairs of cattle horns depicted in the relief from Assurbanipal's palace at Nineveh, noted above.26 Indeed, this was the 20.

T. POTTS [RA 84 basis of his suggestion that the Nineveh relief actually showed the ziggurat of Susa before its destruction by Assurbanipal in the autumn of 646 bc.27 While this proposai cannot, on the basis of present evidence, be verified, it is certainly a sound one. Moreover, if we consider alternative Elamite sites which might be depicted, it is worth noting that the relief showing Madaktu,28 for example, has no ziggurat, nor do the many texts from Tchoga Zanbil concerning the construction of the ziggurats there29 contain any references to horned décoration. Thus, on the face of it, Dombart's hypothesis remains perhaps the most likely. Parenthetically, it should be noted that Syndey Smith drew a comparison between the horns on the Esagila in Babylon and those of the ziggurat at Susa as early as 1928.30 But our purpose here is not to treat the Nineveh relief in any greater détail, rather it is to examine the phenomenon of buildings decorated with horns. We have already seen, both from the archaeological and literary attestations, that the horn occurs at Susa, Babylon and perhaps Mari on temples and at Isin on a city gâte. The symbolic use of the mounted horns of a wild beast is, however, much more widespread in the Near East, much more ancient, and continued much later. One thinks immedi ately of the early shrines at Çatal Hoyùk, in which wild cattle horns were used, mounted in benches or plaster wall reliefs.31 But there are equally late survivais, recently studied by the Arabist R. B. Serjeant, which are just as important. As Serjeant writes, "Horns have never ceased to be fixed on to buildings not only in southern Arabia but in many other parts of the Islamic world".32 According to one Hadïth, the Prophet Muhammad "prayed in the Ka'bah, and he saw two horns hung up in the Ka'bah and ordered them to be veiled (takhmïr), i.e. covered, lest they distract the person praying, through looking at them". Further, we learn that the horns were painted red.33 In the late eleventh century, the Saljuq sultan Malikshah built a minaret at al-Subai'ah, on the pilgrim route from Kufa to Mecca,34into which he is said to have 27.

Mortensen fixed the horns of gazelles and the hoofs of wild asses which he had hunted on his way there. Henceforth the minaret became known as Manârat al-Qurun or Umm al-Qurâ. The minaret was still standing in the mid-fourteenth century, and its former existence is today reflected in the toponym Umm al-Kurun.3B A somewhat similar usage is also noted by Serjeant in southern Arabia, where horns were affixed to a pillar (mud'a) erected to a local saint named Kuwaib, while cattle horns set into an anthropomorphic column have also been reported from Sudan. Serjeant also reports that ibex horns were set into the tomb of the highly esteemed ancestor of a family of judges in Yemen, and he observed a similar practice at a tomb in the Balkh région of Afghanistan.36 Horns have also been observed as décoration above a doorway in southern Arabia.37 35.

POTTS [RA 84-1990] This recalls their use on the houses of khans in Luristan, the phenomenon observed by de Mecquenem and illustrated here in fîg. 4.38 Whether the underlying belief can be considered one of divine protection by supernatural forces is not clear, but certainly possible, especially in view of the fact that the horn has long been considered a symbol of divine power and strength39 Finally, the practice of mounting the head of an animal at the corners of a building's roof after a successful hunt, followed by feasting and célébration, is attested in southern Arabia, where it is part of an entire ritual hunt which appears to have survived from the pre-Islamic era.40 This practice, or one like it, may lie at the root of horn displays on secular buildings in other parts of the Near East. The only conclusion which I wish to draw from the foregoing is that the use of wild animal horns in elevated, conspicuous positions in both religious and secular architecture in the Near East is more widespread, both spatially and temporally, than has generally been acknowledged. Thus, the presence of horns on the Late Uruk sealing from Susa, or the Neo-Assyrian relief from Nineveh, should not be over looked, nor its significance underestimated. Even if the spécifié rationale behind such displays generally éludés us, it is clear that the symbolism involved is one of long standing, which must, I think, be bound up ultimately with notions of divine power and protection. And this applies equally, I suggest, to the ziggurat of Susa, the Ka'bah in Mecca, the commemorative pillar of a saint, the tomb of a revered member of the community, or the house of a local ruler. RÉSUMÉ La présence de cornes sur des bâtiments publics ou religieux a été remarquée par nombre d'érudits. Mais l'usage de cornes n'a jamais été l'objet d'une enquête en tant que phénomène général dans le Proche-Orient ancien. Nous avons tenté de ramasser quelques exemples, archéologiques et littéraires, et de démontrer que l'usage de cornes sur des bâtiments est plus répandu dans l'Antiquité orientale qu'on ne l'a généralement admis. Il est plus fréquent aux époques pré- et postislamiques, et apparemment lié d'une manière générale aux idées d'une signification divine, représentées par les cornes.
