Eco highlights the pun, while Kristeva favours the eucharist, as the defining practice of the metaphoric process. This study primarily concentrates on the models employed by each thinker to delineate their theory of metaphor, and to a lesser degree, metonymy. I examine in detail the implications of each model for a more complete understanding of the tension that exists between their respective semiotic theories. In addition, I provide a literary reading of the language adopted by Eco and Kristeva to explicate their theory of metaphor. I link the mechanistic and computer imagery of Eco to his Peircean understanding of'unlimited semiosis', but also to his refusal to accommodate any extended discussion of the signifying subject in the semiotic field. Kristeva's religious and corporeal imagery, on the other hand, is indicative of her insistence on the inclusion of the speaking subject in any theory of language. I demonstrate that Kristeva's Proustian inspired understanding of metaphor, with the eucharist as a distinguished type, provides her with a markedly Christian ethical model for the psychic operations of the subject. I conclude with an examination of the bounds of semiotic study itself. X. OF LOVE AND TECHNOLOGY: METAPHOR In a burst of confidence for technological advancement, Umberto Eco, in his widely-read text, The Role of the Reader, declares that the possibility now exists for a computer to comprehend the basic structure of metaphor, conceiv ably cognisant not only of its semantic formation, but also of metaphor's creative potentialities.1 This metaphor-machine would be capable of systemat ically generating the progeny of poetic imagination, as well as the conceptual metaphors that frame our everyday thought processes—Zarathustra's 'worn soles'—and even the monotony of catachresis ('foot' of the mountain, 'head' of the class), through a computer-program that dictates the grammatical rules of substitution and contiguity in the signifying chain.2 © Oxford University Press 1997</page><page sequence="2">94 ECO AND KRISTEVA Eco's understanding of metaphor could not be further from that of Julia Kristeva, who places 'transubstantiation' at the core of the metaphorical process, augmenting the hnguistic model with affect, synaesthesia and the possibility for identification and subjectal renewal. In Kristeva's system, it would be impossible to dehumanise the metaphor, since metaphor is grounded in our physical being and lies at the base of our religious and cultural constructions. While Eco makes clear the combinatory activity of the meta phorical process, Kristeva focuses on the metaphor as a vehicle for psychic renewal Kristeva examines the sensual hning from the merger between semantic features, characterised by the ritual of the eucharist, while Eco's text is simply an apologia for a formalist faith in binarisms, illustrated by his examination of the production of the pun. But how can two contemporary theorists nursed on similar philosophical texts, once weaned, adopt such diverse trajectories? Both Kristeva and Eco locate much of their semiotic sensitivity in Jakobson, that prodigy of the Prague Circle, who thoroughly reformulated the metaphor-metonymy rela tionship. But where Eco adds Peirce, Kristeva adds Proust and, despite their shared hnguistic framework, their fundamental understanding of metaphor becomes irreconcilable. Eco dreams of a Peircian unlimited semiosis, repres ented by a computer gushing metaphors from its rigid métonymie code; Kristeva talks of amatory idealisation in linguistic osmosis, semantic units entwining, then metamorphosing, a Proustian 'cool after warmth': that is, an understanding of metaphor based on love.3 II. UMBERTO ECO AND THE METAPHOR-MACHINE The very suggestion of a 'metaphor-machine' is surprising coming from a theorist who is not primarily interested in language as a fixed structure but in the point of intersection between the language code and the language user.4 Eco is not concerned with language in stasis, but has developed a theory that accounts for mobility within the linguistic system itself. His contribution to the study of semiotics aims to account for the ability of the language code to be renewed by those who use it and rejuvenated through the operations of the system. How is it possible, then, armed with a somewhat organic theory of language, for Eco to propose that a machine might be capable of producing the time-honoured material of poetry, prose and philosophy—the fulcrum of human creativity—the metaphor? Is the concept of the metaphor-machine not precisely the definitive anathema to an Eco-based theory of semiotics? Eco's understanding of the Peircean triadic activity of semiosis (the inter change between the sign, the interprétant, and the object) will elucidate his understanding of metaphor further:</page><page sequence="3">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 95 By semiosis I mean an action, an influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object and its interprétant, this tri-relative influence not being in anyway resolvable into actions between pairs.5 This definition is notable primarily because of Peirce's insistence on the inclusion of the operations of the interprétant in any theory of signs. Eco augments and refines Peirce's interprétant in a non-anthropomorphic frame work, indicating that it is that aspect of the sign which intends something other than itself. It is important not to mistake Peirce's interprétant for the addressee. The interprétant is both an element of the sign (its intention, idea) and the starting point for the establishment of a new sign (its production in the mind of the interpreter—its meaning—another representation).6 That is, the interprétant is not simply the meaning or idea that a sign conveys but the creation of another sign, the moment where the understanding of one series of signs is produced only through another system of signs in an infinite 'textual matrix'.7 The elaboration of the operations of the interprétant in the semiotic sphere becomes Eco's contribution to a Peircean unlimited semiosis, where language is defined as being equipped with self-referentially defining terms that augment, clarify and connect one to the other. Perhaps Eco is not aspiring, in positing the metaphor-machine, to a regulative understanding of metaphor, but is presenting a means to discern the possibility for 'unlimited semiosis' as outlined by Peirce. The 'unlimited' in the Peircean expression does not literally indicate that a given text contains all possible meanings, but that the structural organisation of the signification system provides the potential for a text to have a variety of meanings (for different readers or for the same reader). It accounts for the facility of a single sign to carry multiple meanings. It is not a 'free for all' theory of interpretation, where any and all renditions of the text are possible, but indicates the proclivity of signs to extend toward other signs, organised through contiguity in the semantic sphere. Eco's elucidation of Peirce's interprétant becomes the foundation for this theory of unlimited semiosis. It is an understanding of the linguistic system where each sign is part of a larger design of métonymie relations in the chain, permitting a multiplicity of meanings within a given text, 'each term is explained by other terms and where each one is, through an infinite chain of interprétants, potentially explainable by all others'.8 This 'openness' to polyvalence, however, is not interminable but provides what Eco terms the 'field of oriented possibilities', where each reading is both open and yet bound by the contiguous structure of the semantic field.9 It is interesting to note that Eco borrows his main semiotic paradigm from the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to elucidate his organic theory of signification.10 From Ross Quillian's work in AI, Eco assembles The Quillian Model (Model Q) to depict the poly dimensional labyrinth of connected</page><page sequence="4">96 ECO AND KRISTEVA interprétants in any signifying system. This model is constructed very much like the Internet's World Wide Web, where from any point in the network every other point can be reached. Model Q demonstrates the operation of unlimited semiosis within the bounds of all possible reference, demonstrating the pre-determined relations of combination that underlie all linguistic con struction. This is a graphic representation of Eco's ambitious aspiration to map out all of the contiguous relations in the language code: the model therefore anticipates the definition of every sign, thanks to its intercon nection with the universe of all other signs that function as interprétants, each of which is ready to become the sign interpreted by all the others: the model, in its complexity, is based on a process of unlimited semiosis.11 Quite literally, Model Q is the assemblance of all possible signifiers connected to one another through bonds of association, begetting a massive web (infi nite, perhaps) of signification. Model Q, by aggregating the sum of signifiers through relation, is able to foresee all possible uses of the code. Each sign in the linguistic system is structurally linked through the intending faculty of its interprétant (the idea and meaning of the sign), to all other signs in Model Q. It is a complex network of all possible meanings and interpretations—the ultimate fantasy of a formalist linguistics. Eco, however, proposes to fashion this diagram to reflect the flexibility of the general community of language users to accommodate habitual alterations in the combinative field. The series of contiguous relations in the semantic code is perpetually evolving, responding to changes in cultural stimuli. Model Q demonstrates the ability of the linguistic system, structured through contiguity, to both generate and adapt to multiple shifting. Model Q allows for the inclusion of new components to the semantic field, yet every sign (and by extension its application—all acts of signification) is dependent upon pre-existing relations in the model. This flexible structure is not unlike Kristeva's theory of intertextuality, which chronologically precedes Eco's Model Q. Intertextuality demonstrates the ability of a sign system to permit an infinite number of conjunctions with another sign system, resulting in new meaning productions. And like Deleuze and Guattari's rhizomatic struc tures, Model Q imposes a logic without being limited or organised definitively by its own form. As Teresa de Lauretis states, the rhizome 'has no centre, no periphery, and no exit, and is virtually infinite'.12 But where Kristeva and Deleuze and Guattari wish only to depict a pattern and organising principle in certain semiotic operations, Eco wishes to definitively map out the entire semiotic sphere within his model. He must concede, however, that his rhizomatic Model Q can only ever be a 'regulative hypothesis', due to the proclivity of the relations in the code to shift and change.13 Just as the</page><page sequence="5">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 97 construction for the model would be completed, it would already have to be altered to accommodate the modifications made to the estabhshed paths of connection between signifiers. What, then, is the 'motive for metaphor' as Northrop Frye so aptly inquires?14 Eco's response is clear: unlimited semiosis. The proposition of the metaphor-machine is the means through which Eco is able to theorise the metaphor as the vehicle for the process of unlimited semiosis. In Eco's vision, an automaton operating on binary logic would be capable of tracing all metaphors back to the chain of contiguity that is internal to the linguistic system. Eco appeals to the structural operations of the metaphorical process, demonstrating that the signifiers conjoined in metaphor have a relationship that is independent of the phenomenal world. That is, the metaphoric process is linguistic, an operation between signs in an ordered sign-system. Metaphor is not based on a similarity between things in the concrete world, but is an example of'infro-' or 'inter-sememic connections'.15 The metaphoric process is determined by the code itself, structurally inscribed through the linking of interprétants delineated in Eco's Model Q. Linguistic connection through mutual resemblance—the 'this is that' of the Frye-metaphor—is not created as such by an individual, but involves a drawing together of signifiers already associated in the métonymie chain.16 Metaphor is first grounded in metonymy, the organising principle of the semantic arena. Metonymy is generally defined as the substitution of one sign for another associated sign (commonly referred to as 'the part for the whole'). In 'The Semantics of Metaphor', however, Eco uses metonymy very much in the way Jakobson and Lacan employ the terms, where metonymy is related to contiguity between signifiers, their linear sequence and 'semic interdepend ence'.17 This métonymie relation is what Jane Gallop calls, 'the forward push to finish signification'.18 No signifier ever ends, as such, but perpetually extends toward its interprétant in the contiguous web of signs. As Lacan states, 'in the chain of the signifier the meaning insists but none of its elements consists in the signification of which it is at the moment capable'.19 The Model Q, with its inter-connected, criss-crossing mass of associations is a mapping of the structural métonymie principles enmeshed in the total signifying arena. Creativity exists, but only in a semiotic motility, finding resemblance in pre-existing linguistic relations. With Model Q as its program, the 'hypothet ical automaton' need only map the available web of binary choices to create a series of meaningful metaphors.20 Metonymy in Model Q is fixed by structure, and therefore, mechanistic, codifiable, capable of being pro grammed onto a computer chip. Or, as Eco would have it in his latest novel, The Island of the Day Before, Padre Emanuele's Aristotelian Machine—an elabor ate assemblage of card catalogues which create endless metaphors by fusing</page><page sequence="6">ECO AND KRISTEVA 21 associated terms under the organisation of Aristotle's ten categories. Padre's machine, like Eco's Model Q, is an ambitious attempt to encompass all possible signification in a single model, providing metaphor-on-demand. I am, however, inclined to agree with Richard Rorty's observation that, while Eco's semiotic theory appears to 'read hke an attempt to crack the code of codes', his novels appear as satirical invocations of his own semiotic theories.22 As Teresa de Lauretis has noted, The Name of the Rose follows a seemingly facile structure patterned on the murder mystery genre. William— Eco's medieval Holmes (both in method and physical appearance, and complete with substance addiction)—progresses in a linear fashion, semiotically tracking clues to discern the hidden connection, that is, the underlying structure, that binds them. Though William solves the crime through this system he finds in the end that 'there was no key: every crime had a different author or no author at all: there was no single plan'.23 The novel deconstructs the semio tician's desire for general laws, structure and organisation. Commenting on Foucault's Pendulum, Rorty states, 'I interpreted the novel as a send-up of structuralism—of the very idea of structures which stand to texts or cultures as skeletons to bodies, programs to computers, or keys to locks'.24 By extension, I would like to submit that Padre Emanuele (literally 'Father-God-with-us'), the slightly demented 17th Century Jesuit Priest from The Island of the Day Before, is Eco's latest cameo appearance, the contemporary semiotician as the latter-day priest, a self-sketched caricature of Eco as the taxonomous theoreti cian. Clearly Eco's formalist aspirations are ridiculed in his prose texts, though not rejected as fully erroneous, as The Name of the Rose demonstrates, when a false system paradoxically provides the means to reach an accurate conclusion. Yet even in his theoretical work, Eco's purpose is not to develop a formally rigid model of the metaphoric process, but to elucidate further the flexibility of Model Q to respond to the operations of unlimited semiosis. In the Quillian model, Eco proposes to establish that the possibilities for metaphor, through combination and resemblance in the Q paradigm, are not limited by the structure, but incalculable because of the organising pattern: that is, they are fixed, but not finite. A metaphor is a metaphor because it discloses previously existing métonymie combinations, but culture provides the signifying system with its network of contiguous relations. Metaphor, therefore, is always the product of an ever-changing 'culturalized contiguity'.25 These relations, determined by societal forces are not fixed signifiers, but connections established through language in use, in context. The entire 'problem' of metaphoric creativity, as Eco calls it, is not elimin ated by the establishment of Model Q, but merely becomes 'susceptible to translation in binary terms' and, consequently, easily transferable to a computer program.26 And yet, Eco maintains that metaphoric creativity does not consist</page><page sequence="7">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 99 in generating new elements into the linguistic code but by making anterior bonds visible: Apparently, one entity is in the place of the other by virtue of a mutual resemblance. But the resemblance is due to the fact that in the code there exists already fixed relations of substitution which, in some way or other, link the substitute entities to those substituted for.27 A metaphor-wielding artist is not a deity, creating new forms, but an explorer, traversing the intricate pathways inscribed in the bnguistic system. A 'creative metaphor' in Eco's vision, is the recognition of identity between terms in the bnguistic chain that have not yet been integrated by a community. The connection appears original, unprecedented, when it is a direct acknowledge ment of what has always been latent in the sequential organisation of the signifying system. The metaphoric process is not a simple recognition of métonymie links in Eco's Model Q but a revolutionary process of anticipating combinations not foreseen by the linguistic order. These are combinations which are inscribed within the system but not yet acknowledged by the culture. In a related essay, Eco states that 'epiphanies' which feel magical, fantastical and ground-breaking, follow this same pattern of exposing preced ing linguistic relations that were not readily visible. It would seem that by extension Eco suggests that a computer is not only capable of providing the creative component of metaphor, but is also able to generate the mystical quality of the epiphany.28 Metaphor demonstrates the 'unlimited' semiotic potential depicted in Model Q. The metaphoric process is internal, residing within the signifying system, established through resemblance from terms within the métonymie code. The metaphorical process is therefore always semiotic and, by extension, makes statements about the nature of the signifying system itself Eco delineates a theory of metaphor from within, a linguistic phenomena, bound by contiguous relations in the code, while self-referentially evaluating the code itself. It is interesting that both Eco and Kristeva turn to Joyce to elucidate their theory of metaphor. Eco employs Finnegans Wake, (which he designates a 'textual machine') with its miniature but intricate Model Q, to demonstrate that the pun is the most poignant example of the semiotic movement to occur in the metaphorical process.29 Eco argues that the pun is a double metaphor which flagrantly exhibits, rather than conceals, the contiguous arrangement that establishes similarity between signifiers. The terms conflated in a pun form a particular kind of metaphor where both the vehicle (the substituting word or words) and the tenor (the substituted word or words) are connected by phonic or semantic affinity.30 A pun, more clearly than a metaphor, reveals the complex substratum of metonymy that binds the terms</page><page sequence="8">100 ECO AND KRISTEVA together in a single embrace. The 'ghost signifier(s)', implied but not explicit in the metaphor, are glaring in the pun and qualify the present signifiers in a reciprocal arrangement of both identity and difference. These reciprocally defining terms contribute to the multiplicity of meanings generated by the pun, making the pun both 'vehicle and tenor' and therefore a multiple metaphor.31 For example, Eco creates his own pun using an expression from Joyce; he refers to Joyce's Finnegans Wake as a 'slipping beauty'.32 The phonetic and semantic links are manifold: 'slipping', may be a reference to the linguistic operations ofjoyce's text, but it also extends phonetically toward 'sleeping' (is this a reference to the quality of the text?), but 'sleeping' also intimates the fairy tale 'sleeping beauty', where 'slipping' may then imply a loss of charm or innocence, a loss of mythic tales with happy endings. In any kind of metaphor, but in a pun particularly, there is a condensation of properties, a reciprocal transference of features between several terms. The conflation of terms affects the cultural network by either renewing or develop ing new associative links in the signifying chain. While the metaphor is constituted by the contiguity of terms, the pun makes this relationship most manifest. The contiguity is violently thrust upon two or more signifiers in a pun, resulting in an overt polyvalence that qualifies the metonymy which generates its existence. The metaphor-pun has the capacity to simultaneously temper the métonymie chain at the same time as the métonymie chain supports the metaphor-pun. The pun 'short circuits' the signifying system by assimilating various connections that previously existed in the Quillian Model.33 Instead of following the sequential métonymie connections in the Quillian web, the pun jumps rapidly in a 'leap of faith', a faith in the certainty of the contiguous chain that grounds its metaphorical operation.34 Eco's theory of metaphor, with the pun as a distinguished type, is quintes sentially semiotic. He describes metaphor in purely linguistic terms, its systemic nature determined by societal norms and cultural practices that are reflected in the linguistic code. Eco's theory also allows for the possibility of metaphor, and pun specifically, to create 'metasemiotic judgements' that interrogate the validity of the semantic structure illustrated in the Quillian Model.35 Metaphor not only demonstrates that the semantic system is capable of self contradictions, ('once we begin to substitute D for A by métonymie connec tions we discover that D has some semes in contradiction with those of A'), but it produces innovative semiotic information by demonstrating the before unseen métonymie connections that inherently bind the two or more terms together.36 Puns make visible the codification that was previously unrecognis able and in so doing, elucidates the very operations of the Quillian Model. The question then becomes, not whether an automaton would be adept at generating metaphor, but whether a computer would be able to allow its program to be modified by both the continual influx of cultural information</page><page sequence="9">KATHLEEN O'GRADY ioi and the very metaphors it generates. It would be one feat to program a computer with the entire Q Model—the sum of culturally inscribed contigu ous relations in the linguistic chain—(which Eco indicates could only ever conceivably take place hypothetically) but it would be quite another feat for a computer to be competent to fashion 'metasemiotic judgements' on the level of human metaphor. It is not surprising to find that less than five years following the publication date of 'The Semantics of Metaphor', the essay in which Eco states that 'it would be possible ... to construct an automaton capable of generating and understanding metaphors', he forcibly reverses his position and concludes an extensive chapter on metaphor in Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language with the following caution, 'No algorithm exists for the metaphor, nor can a metaphor be produced by means of a computer's precise instructions, no matter what the volume of organised information to be fed in'.37 Of course, it is the right of every living philosopher to change his or her mind. III. JULIA KRISTEVA AND THE POST-THEOLOGICAL EUCHARIST Eco's definition of the pun as a conflation of terms that do not eradicate one another but exist together in mutual modification, is closer to Kristeva's definition of metaphor generally. While Eco provides a grand metanarrative for the operations of the metaphoric process, Kristeva examines the subjective effect of metaphor, the knowledge granted from the interaction between linguistic elements, endowing metaphor with an archaic, prelinguistic quality that other theories do not (fully) account for. The Kristevan metaphor initiates a subjective process that transports identities by blurring boundaries without cancelling difference, resulting in a metamorphosis: the ideal representation for a forever, fragmented, identity. In a rejection of Lacanian psychoanalysis with its emphasis on metonymy and desire, Kristeva returns to Freud (the 'original Father') to enrich her pre Oedipal construct for understanding early subjective formation (primary iden tification). Unsatisfied with the descriptions of an autoeroticism that permeates the mother-child symbiosis prior to the mirror-stage of development, she seeks to augment the pre-specular relationship by outlining the archaic foundations for the acquisition of language. She finds an undeveloped refer ence in Freud's Moses and Monotheism and The Ego and the Id to a third party that is capable of enriching her knowledge of primary identification: the father in individual prehistory' (père de la préhistoire individuelle).38 The symbiotic union between the child and the maternal container is disturbed by this third element, not a person, but a non-anthropomorphic, social, and linguistic representa tion of the love that the archaic mother expresses for someone outside the mother-child dyad. Despite their names, neither the archaic mother, nor the imaginary</page><page sequence="10">102 ECO AND KRISTEVA father are gendered subjects, since sexual awareness does not occur prior to the emergence of the Oedipal ego. Rather, the third party is someone for whom the mother expresses desire, someone other than the child and it is this ternary structure that diverts the homogeneity between the mother-child entity. Central to the operations of this tertiary economy is the understanding that the love expressed by the mother toward the imaginary father is commun icated through language, a discourse that disturbs the undifferentiated body of the mother-child and propels the child toward a 'speaking other'.39 Without this third element the subject would forever fall into abjection, unable to fully separate from the unity with the archaic mother and unable to cultivate completely an individual subjectivity. Kristeva does not so much critique Lacan's mirror-stage (much to the chagrin of many feminists), as amplify the identification process. She asks: 'Does the 'mirror stage' emerge out of nowhere?'40 and implies, 'does the archaic mother have no role in language acquisition'? Not satisfied with the over bearing position that Lacan grants the Symbolic (the Law of the Father) in the development of the speaking subject, Kristeva describes an earlier identificatory process. This primary identification involves the heterogeneous conveyance of identity from maternal fusion toward the object of the mother's love—the imaginary father. It is not a full separation, a complete subjectivity (which Kristeva still believes only occurs during the mirror-stage) but a multiple identification that provides the substratum for the speaking subject. This movement is not one of possession or need—I must have object a— but a movement toward identification with a loved other. It is not a motion to 'have' but a gesture toward 'being like' (être-comme), that is, a metaphoric identification.41 The imaginary father provides an early transference of drive energy toward the language of an other. The identification, a conglomeration of the archaic trinity (mother-child-father), is drive-laden, bubbling with heterogeneous forces that simultaneously disperse and unify the (not-yet) subject. Kristeva's new triadic pattern restructures the psychoanalytic notion of primary narcissism, and places a metaphoric identification at the heart of the subject. This firm dismissal of Lacanian metonymy of desire allows Kristeva to remove the mother's body from the sphere of objectai relations, while simultaneously placing primary identification in the domain of love.42 Critics (of which Eco is one) have mistakenly understood Kristeva's theory of language as regressive and her theory of metaphor overly ontological— ontological because it emphasises the subject outside of language over the operations of signs in the signifying system. This view is based on a complete misreading of the Kristevan project. Though she undoubtedly emphasises the power of metaphor on subjective formation, her concept implicitly remains linguistic. Metaphoricity is defined by Kristeva, as an examination of a 'given number of specific states of the subject of the utterance act ... who demonstrates</page><page sequence="11">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 103 by means of metaphors the complex process of identification'.43 This defini tion highlights the operations of idealisation in discourse, a replication of primary narcissism, a discursive echo of the pre-Oedipal triadic relationship. Yet tacitly manifest is Kristeva's concept of the 'subject'—not an external corporeal entity or a physiological internal process, but always already a speaking subject. The operations of subjectivity and intersubjectivity are linguistic, referential, encoded in and by the signifying system. In Kristevan analysis, there is no subject without language, and consequently there can be no analysis of language without the subject. It is not surprising to find that both Kristeva's semiotic and psychoanalytic writings are motivated by an understanding of aesthetic textual productions. In linguistic creation Kristeva discovers the space where the subject plays within the ambiguity of the signifier, 'a place for excess and absurdity, ecstasy and death', a place for enacting the cacophony of pre-specular subjectivity.44 Idealisation is perpetually actualised in literary production, indicating the necessity for the continuous renewal of the linguistic subject. Metaphoric production, with its capacity to obscure the border between signifiers, best illustrates the operations of primary identification in the linguistic contract. But the conflation of semantic features compressed in a single trope not only obscures the boundaries of the discursive subject but problematizes the univocity of the sign. The sign is dispersed, made ambivalent; a paradox, metaphor is both one and the other, neither this, nor that. It is equivocally consolidated in difference yet bound by similitude, causing meaning to shift and open up, sliding toward an 'infinity of the signifier'.45 The metaphor strains the signifying system to bursting: 'The "like" of the metaphorical conveyance both assumes and upsets that constraint and, to the extent that it probabilizes the identity of signs, questions the very probability of the reference'.46 Nothing could be less ontological. The metaphoric movement refuses to allow the illusion of presence in the signifier. The terms conjoined in a single feature have no clear object of reference, but entertain a semantic slippage which takes place within the signifying system. Is it possible that there is a meeting place, after all, between Eco and Kristeva? Is not Kristeva's understanding of metaphor, like Eco's, quintessen tially semiotic? Kristeva dehneates the metaphor in purely linguistic terms: semantic features thrust together in a marriage of identity and non-identity, where signification is confounded by this doubling, elaborated and augmented but ultimately dispersed and propelled forward. Metaphor designates 'not an ontology, that is, something outside of discourse, but the constraint of discourse itself'.47 Kristeva endows the metaphoric process with a self reflexive capacity, capable of initiating 'metasemiotic judgements' on the level of Eco-metaphor. The metaphoric process, by destroying the univocal identity (never truly present anyway) of the sign, exhibits openly all the</page><page sequence="12">104 ECO AND KRISTEVA perforations in the operations of the semantic arena, the slippage, the ambiguity, the movement forward implicit in any act of signification. Metaphor becomes the site where the referent and, by extension, the entire operations of the linguistic process both destroys and renews itself through its association with other semantic terms in the signifying arena. Kristeva finds in poetic metaphor the best example of the conjunction between both semiotic and subjective metaphoric operations. The speaking subject, Kristeva demonstrates, is irredeemably linked to the discursive Other by means of metaphor. This sublime Other, however, is neither the identity of the originary term (vehicle) nor the identity of the second term (tenor), nor even the coupling of the two (metaphor), but the 'very space of metaphor ical shifting', the place where meaning floats in gende waves between loosely linked signifiers.48 The identificatory process is motivated by the conglomera tion of the terms fused in metaphor, while the heterogeneity of significance is simultaneously mimetic of the same (idealisation) process. Metaphorization brings the subject to speech and to poetic and artistic representations particu larly, with their multi-layered polyphonous and polysémie capering. It oper ates through a textual imaginary process, a reverberation of the first imaginary process (that longing for the pre-Oedipal father) which provides the originary ground for the subject of language and imagination. It is a reciprocal construction and deconstruction of the subject in language. It is Proustian metaphor particularly that discloses, for Kristeva, a linguistic illustration of that flexible, plastic subjectivity that a metaphorical transaction not only allows but demands.49 This polymorphic subjectivity, fuelled by the metaphoric process, is a merging not only of images or ideas, but of time, memory and space. It is a fusion of contradiction and paradox in a single term, assaulting the subject 'like a bolt of lightening'.50 This amalgamation of sensations engenders a subjectal metamorphosis: a movement with the ability to transform, 'incarnate', 'transubstantiate'.51 It is not incidental that Kristeva employs religious language to identify the Proustian trope. Proustian metaphor is elemental, pregnant with synaesthetic power, a 'complex abracadabra' that can transform the subject, drawing it back toward the archaic Other, that which is sacred and divine.52 In Kristevan theory metaphor becomes the linguistic search (or jouissance, for articulating that archaic Thing (that sublime space which cannot be articulated). It is a reaching toward the unnameable, the absent: 'Mamma is the starting mechanism [of metaphor], a central erotic secret'.53 The Kristevan metaphor is mater-phor. Kristeva inverts standard feminist theories of the eucharist, like those espoused by Naomi Goldenberg,54 which depict the ritual as the consumption of the male body of Christ to displace the female body. Kristeva's understanding of the eucharist instead links the metaphoric movement, and thus the eucharist itself, to a consummation with the maternal body.</page><page sequence="13">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 105 Kristeva is one of those strange hybrids, so common among contemporary French thinkers, who, having discovered religion, discards God. In allegiance with this spiritual agnosticism, Kristeva in her essay, 'Identification and the Real' designates the eucharist as the metaphoric rite 'par excellence', the 'fulcrum of all other identifications'.55 In early Kristevan analysis, religious discourse was rejected, represented as the symbolic aspiration to homogenise difference. In her most recent works, however, Kristeva re-examines Christianity (Catholicism specifically) as a dramatisation of the internal strangeness (difference, otherness, foreignness) found at the base of every subject. As she states herself, 'I speak of religions because the question of the other is fundamentally, I think, a religious question'.56 The eucharist becomes the perfect enactment of the Kristevan metaphorical process providing a succession of polymorphic states of subjectivity based especially in an identification with the body of an Other.57 As Cleo McNelly Kearns has noted, Kristeva's focus on the material aspect of the sacrament and its relation to the 'signifying word' are inspired by Aquinas.58 The eucharist, in Kristeva's vision, involves a crossing-over, a conflation of both physical nutrition (bread and wine) and the signifying body (the Word), an intersection between the physical and the psychic.59 Kristeva scorns those who rationalise transubstantiation as a semblance of passage from bread to body. The eucharistie rite is an actual assimilation of the Word, the body of Christ, a 'phantasmatic identification' that conflates both drives and verbal repres entations into a single moment.60 In order to open our self up to the other, it is necessary to renew the self through an identificatory process that allows for the internalisation of foreignness. This subjective process is not a mimetic imitation of an other, not a comparison, but the actual absorption of other into self, a 'mystical metamorphosis' in the spirit of Baudelaire.61 The eucharist is the perfect combination of divine and human, a sacred movement encom passing the real, imaginary and symbolic. It is an identification from the body toward language and return. Clearly Kristeva is not interested in creating a eucharistie theology, but in describing an identificatory process that is both natural and mystical, both of the body and language. And so it is to literature that she turns for her examples. Proust's famous 'Petites Madeleines' comprise for Kristeva an excellent example of an aesthetic sacrament, which describes by means of metaphor an epiphanic transformation. In the cold of winter, Proust accepts the offering of tea and cake from his mother. The sensation of the warm liquid mixed with the plump cake summons an earlier impression. On Sundays before mass, Proust recalls his aunt Léonie dipping 'the litde scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds' in a lime tisane.62 Sensations fuse—the fragrant lime, the scalloped shell heavy on the thick of the tongue, the warm body of mother, of aunt Léonie, body and blood ingested on a</page><page sequence="14">io6 ECO AND KRISTEVA mass Sunday—in a eucharistie movement, like love in all of its intensity, involving the transportation of the 'I' to the 'sublime Other'.63 Tea and cake, a domestic communion, as Proust's Madeleine, conjoined with the tisane, draws the subject toward the essence of an other. Proust describes his altered state: At once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory—this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this was not in me, it was me.64 Both spiritual and corporeal, the invocation of the Petites Madeleines through memory is accompanied by an affective intensity, a transgression of bodily boundaries that divides the subject in order to grant it a fusion, but a fusion based on the heterogeneity within the subject. And this metaphoric unity, through difference, is what guarantees a healthy individual subjectivity. The condensation of terms affords a jouissance. It is the result of a subjective merging: the I is both I and other, 'without being able to distinguish the dividing line', a kind of possession, both imaginary and real, with an efficacy that impacts on the vitality and strength of subjectivity.65 The self, having been wrenched from its stasis within the maternal container, 'leaves its resting place and attempts to rise ... I can feel it mounting slowly ... I can hear the echo of great spaces traversed'.66 This eucharistie movement is an enactment of an imaginary relationship, in psychoanalytic terms, a transferential identi fication that provides the conditions for a dynamic psychic renewal. James Joyce also affords an entrance into the eucharistie movement for Kristeva.67 But it is with Joycean prose that Kristeva focuses her atten tion, a prose style that incessandy spells out a series of multiple identifications. While Eco highlights the punning in Joyce, Kristeva points to the innumerable eucharistie condensations throughout his work. 'Contras magnificandjewbangtantiality' is a word that aligns so many signs through phonic and semantic association that it threatens Eco's webbed Model Q with collapse, giving way to an infinite black hole. Kristeva notes that Joyce delights in challenging and transgressing the logic of language, what she terms, 'the symbolic'. This comprises the referential and communicative facet of language. The 'semiotic', on the other hand, is a linguistic expression of the drive force that disrupts the syntactic and semantic functions of language.68 Some critics have mistakenly understood Kristeva's semiotic-symbolic exchange as an elaboration of the binary computer model, but her theory is structured more on a mutual interaction of terms than on a o-i structure.69 Kristeva herself indicates that the logic of the semiotic in dialogue with the symbolic ('poetic language') defies the o-i binarisms of the computer model.70 Similarly she rejects the idea that her theory is in any way similar to the</page><page sequence="15">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 107 analogical-digital debate. She states, 'The heterogeneity between the semiotic and the symbolic cannot be reduced to the well known distinction between the analogical and digital ... [It] is analogical and digital at the same time'.71 Very early in her semiotic work Kristeva distanced herself from mechanistic and computer imagery generally and, even in her most recent work, continues to favour corporeal metaphors to explain the operations of the semiotic-symbolic exchange. Joyce employs this 'semiotic' realm, a logic of rupture, rhythm and con densation in place of the referential and sequential logic of the 'symbolic'. He makes use of the dynamic, material component of language, its playfulness and illogicality. 'Contrasmagnificandjewbangtantiality' opens up the subject of language to ambiguity by supplanting linearity and univocity, and by interrogating the notion of a unified subject (either reader or writer). Kristeva provides a theory of language that endeavours to account for alterity at the base of the speaking subject. Joycean condensations (a type of metaphor metonym conglomerate since they are joined by contiguity and association) incorporate the psychic identification process of Christian ritual not only through content (since Joyce talks incessantly of the eucharist) but more importantly, stylistically. The semiotic libidinal drives (expressed through affective language) transform and relativize the denotation of the symbolic realm, dissolving the fiction of a unified identity by creating a dynamic subject that is open to difference. Joyce becomes Kristeva's post-Christian, finding in discourse a place to communicate the operations of eucharistie identification, the motivation for his literary style.72 But what stimulates this eucharistie movement which is not comparison or mere analogy but the transport of both drives and signs? What gives the host-metaphor this sensory, affective power? Agape. Kristeva finds in Christian agape—a term she interchanges freely with primary identification and primary narcissism73—an unconditional love which becomes the vehicle for the fusion of 'l'amour sublimé' of the metaphorical process.74 Agape provides a spiritual enactment of the loving that exists in the pre-Oedipal triad. I am never autonomous, but always structured by this gift of love from an other. I am always already the 'subject of the other' and it is this love that makes me a subject and thus grants meaning to my speech. With such a privileging of the metaphoric-eucharistic movement, it is perhaps not surprising to find Kristeva balancing her psychoanalytic notion of subjectivity on a theological understanding of love: Christian love: paternal, narcissistic, maternal, finds utterance in all fonts of individual lapses, and offers perhaps the richest mosaic of words that the human being, that precocious, possessed person, that lover, ever need hear.75</page><page sequence="16">io8 ECO AND KRISTEVA The Kristevan focus shifts from an exclusive examination of avant-garde aesthetic practices to a theory of subjectivity based on the triadic economy ('paternal, narcissistic, maternal') that grounds religious language. The eucharist is the primary example of this metaphoric osmosis, this doubling, this becoming one in love: Kristeva quotes Jesus, 'He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him'.76 The eucharistie rite is a dramatisation of the metaphorical movement internal to primary narcissism, providing a symbolic replenishment for the individual, an epiphanic re-enactment of subjective formation, not just identification, but tran substantiation. Her Proustian inspired understanding of metaphor, with the eucharist as a distinguished type, provides Kristeva with a markedly Christian ethical model for the psychic functioning of a subject that both rejects and desires the other. The metaphor grants a means for identification with the other through condensation without the erasure of difference; it creates a subjective space for heterogeneity by uncovering internal foreignness at the site of the self.77 Kristeva's understanding of metaphor offers up the possibility (not fully developed in her own texts) for a highly individualised subjectivist ethics (knowledge of the stranger within) as a foundation for intersubjective relations in the contemporary world. Kristeva's theory of metaphoricity curiously, for a philosopher who was once so vehemently against any form of religion, aligns her directly with theological interests. It is the great 'eternal return to divinity' that appears contagious among her French philosophical contemporaries.78 For her part, an assessment of Western subjectivity necessitates a detailed understanding of religious texts and practices. She now includes in her exhaustive examinations of literary texts, a sympathetic account of the role religion plays in the development of subjectivity, indicating that both literature and religion offer a means to access the place of that 'sublime Other'. And Kristeva now regards atheism as the most severe form of repression. Atheism is depicted as a condition that is based solely on a repudiation of the 'father in individual prehistory'—a wistful reckoning back toward the undisturbed mother-child dyad of the pre-Oedipal state.79 Atheism is a severe rejection of the meta phoric coupling that Kristeva believes is the foundation for a healthy, fully developed subjectivity. Furthermore, Kristeva also commonly aligns the posi tion of the psychoanalyst with that of the priest, indicating that primary identification through metaphoricity can and should be replicated for the health of the subject, 'by the priest or by the therapist'.80 A convoluted agreement arises between Eco and Kristeva on this point, as they both playfully depict themselves, semiotician and psychoanalyst, in priestly robes. As Eco finds his way through semiotics by means of Artificial Intelligence, Kristeva finds her</page><page sequence="17">KATHLEEN O'GRADY 109 way through psychoanalysis by means of theology, entitling her theory an 'esthetic religion,' a 'religion of the imagination'.81 IV. conclusion: establishing the bounds of semiotic study I have taken us down two divergent paths. Is it possible that they could ever have started in the same place, both thinkers consuming similar texts, breath ing in the same intellectual time and space? I have not attempted to simply place one theory against the other, an exercise which annihilates the particular to the general. Instead I have tried to highlight Eco's holistic search for unity in structure by means of the metaphor. A contemporary explorer of technology, he has all the faith in conquest of the early explorers. But his triumph would be a total assimilation of all possible meaning, nothing less. Kristeva is also undertaking that search for the 'One', but her path leads to a resurrection of psychoanalysis, that most pious of faiths. Her metaphor, grounded wholly in the body, charts the corporeal suffering of division. Is it really so strange that the man thinks through the machine and the woman through the body; the man through unity and the woman through division? While I have examined in detail the different strategies used by Eco and Kristeva to delineate the metaphorical process, I have also provided an examination of the models that each employ to ground their respective semiotic systems. What becomes clear from this study is the fundamental divide between Eco and Kristeva on the boundary for semiotic study itself. Eco has developed an elaborately formal study of semiotics. Though his theory incorporates the ability of the code to shift and change to accommodate a community of users (both a synchronic and diachronic understanding of the sign), he refuses to accommodate the speaking subject in his analysis. Instead, he prefers to conserve its 'ghostly presence' and declares his opposition toward any study of the subject within the scope of semiotic theory: Any other attempt to introduce a consideration of the subject into the semiotic discourse would make semiotics trespass on one of its 'natural boundaries'.82 Eco prefers to isolate the sign, to separate it from human contamination and understand the laws that engender its production. Subjective and inter subjective semiotic theories perpetuate an idealism. A semiotics can only be 'testable', he insists, if it is taken in isolation, in quarantine.83 A properly scientific study would acknowledge the presence of an empirical subject, but contend only with the performance of signs themselves in the signifying system. Eco expresses a clear hostility toward those theories which prioritise the subject of signification. In particular, he targets Kristeva's theory as a 'degener ate notion of [the] linguistic sign' and suggests that this is a deviation from</page><page sequence="18">no ECO AND KRISTEVA the 'most mature' philosophies of language.84 However, As Vincent Colapietro has noted, Eco's rejection of subjectivity in signification is a curious departure from a Peircean conception of semiotics. In fact, anticipat ing post-modern philosophy, Peirce not only acknowledged the subject of sign production and reception but was 'sensitive to the divided character of the human subject' in the discursive process.85 Eco's dehumanising movement is a firm rejection of the Peircean agenda. His attempt to formalise fully the linguistic process has culminated in the total effacement of the subject from the signifying system. Eco professes that this is purely a 'methodological' and not a 'metaphysical' presumption but the claim is weak.86 As both Colapietro and de Lauretis have noted, 'rather than avoiding idealism, ...he appears to lapse into it'.87 By effacing subjectivity from the signifying process, Eco reflexively replicates the pre-eminence granted to the transcendental ego of both structuralist and formalist linguistics; there could be no greater 'meta physical' supposition. Eco's utopie vision of computer generated metaphors is not haphazard or random but contingent upon this idealism. Tire mechanistic and computer terminology that saturates all of Eco's texts is a direct consequence of this refusal to accommodate the subject in signification. The computer alone can provide Eco with that unified cogito, a synthesising and totalizing, yet disem-bodied entity that can initiate programmable signification. Nothing could be further from a Kristevan semiotics which places at its centre a critique of the transcendental ego inherited (most recently) from structural linguistics. In this ego's place, Kristeva puts a linguistic subject that is based on dialogism and alterity. She formulates a split-subject (semiotic symbolic) that is marked by both physiological drives (that constitute part of the signifying process), as well as by the cultural structures that modify and motivate linguistic operations. As if addressing Eco directly (though it is likely that Chomsky and the Grammarians were her original targets) she states: The theory of meaning now stands at a crossroad: either it will remain an attempt at formalizing meaning-systems by increasing sophistication of the logico-mathematical tools which enable it to formulate models on the basis of a conception (already rather dated) of meaning as the act of a transcendental ego, cut off from its body, its unconscious and also its history; or else it will attune itself to the theory of the speaking subject as a divided subject (conscious/ unconscious).88 Kristeva's project rejects the pseudo-mathematical formalism that threatens to topple linguist study and instead works to unite the body with language, signification with physiological drives and historical-societal forces. Issues of gender, in particular, can enter the semiotic arena with the Kristevan frame work, while they find no place in an Eco-based semiotics which substitutes a gendered speaking-subject with a computer (a contemporary version of</page><page sequence="19">KATHLEEN O'GRADY in philosophy's long tradition to escape from the corporeal body). Kristeva's 'transubstantiating metaphor' is a direct result of this insistence on the inclu sion of the divided subject in any theory of language. The corporeal and religious language which suffuses her texts is consistent with her desire to reconcile the social and the physical, cultural constructions with libidinal drives, body with text. The eucharist provides an ideal means to theorise the meeting place of drives and signs within a rich cultural practice. Eco views Kristeva's theory as an example of what semiotic theory should reject; a proper semiotic study does not include the signifying subject. He insists that any study of the subject of signification is 'beyond the semiotic threshold' and that practitioners of semiotic studies should simply 'accept this limit'; Kristeva's work on subjectivity, Eco states, is a 'threshold-trespassing semiotics'.89 Eco's use of territorial language is revealing. Kristeva's theory 'trespasses', it is 'beyond' and outside the confines of semiotics, it 'confuses' and mistakes; Kristeva does not 'accept the limit' that Eco himself outlines for semiotic theory. Eco aims to surgically separate the function of the sign from that of the subject. He wants no mixing or muddling of borders. He wants clean edges, clear spaces and neatly contained contents.90 He does not invalid ate the necessity for such work (in those lesser subjects such as psychology, sociology), but indicates that it is beyond the bound of the (real) semiotic frame. The question emerges: why does Eco feel it necessary at all to delineate a specific territory for the study of semiotics? We can, perhaps, attribute much of the blame to Saussure for initiating this marking of territory. Often great thinkers are not described as such for providing succinct and totalizing philosophical systems, but for simply asking the right questions. Saussure was one of these great 'enquiring minds'. The findings in Cours de linguistique Générale have provided the foundation for much of contemporary semiotic and linguistic studies. Yet perhaps his greatest contribution was extending the realm of linguistics to a broader theory of the sign. Saussure framed his study and shaped the ensuing generation of the humanities and social sciences simply by asking: what is the domain of semiology?91 Eco and Kristeva have each taken up the Saussurian quest, though it may well be true, as Terry Eagleton has stated, that 'if Saussure could have foreseen what he started he might well have stuck to the genitive case in Sanskrit'.92 Most of Eco's texts could be read as part of an encyclopedic project to map out the scope of semiotic study. What this has sometimes resulted in has been the closing and protecting of self-imposed boundaries that privilege the form and structure of semiotic systems. Kristeva, on the other hand, has taken Saussure's project as an invitation to subsume new areas in the name of semiology. She continues to extend the domain of the semiotic inquiry to encompass subjectivity in all its linguistic manifestations. What one sees as a</page><page sequence="20">ECO AND KRISTEVA confused mingling of the disciplines, the other sees as the central focus of any science of signs; what one rejects, the other embraces.

Frye is echoing a Wallace Stevens poem here. Frye's understanding of the 'motive for metaphor' is the anti thesis of Eco's.
