KRIEGER DISTRIBUTED very widely through the Southeastern United States, a rich assemblage of specialized artifacts has long impressed archaeologists as being representative of an exotic ceremonial influence. For sixty years or more a succession of authorities has suggested or insisted that the inspiration for these objects came from Mexico or, more cautiously, from "Middle America". Reference usually has centered on such specimens as the shell gorgets and copper plates from Etowah, for these depict ceremonially garbed human figures with great wings, and are thus commonly held to portray an idea analogous to that of Eagle Men in various codices of Highland Mexico. However, these figures are but part of an extensive list of objects evidently of a ceremonial nature in Southeastern archaeology. Phillips' has discussed the general aspects of Middle American influence on the "Middle Mississippi" culture, into which the bulk of this material falls. Soon after, Ford and Willey3 published a brief but tantalizing sketch of what they termed the "Southern Cult", a powerful and rapidly spreading religious movement in the Southeast. The presence of this cult was deduced from an impressive list of spectacular artifacts which seem to appear suddenly in various parts of the Southeast: During the Temple Mound II stage there appears to have arisen a curious cult which shows little relationship to anything which has previously transpired, and which spread rapidly over the entire Mississippi Valley area, although most common in the south. The paraphernalia from which the presence of this cult is deduced show a high degree of similarity all over the area. Included are such items as conch shell masks marked with the winged or "weeping" eye symbol; copper and shell pendants with circles and crosses engraved, repousse, or with background cut out; engraved conch shells or thin 1 The writer is much indebted to the following for reading and freely criticizing the original draft of this paper: A. J. Waring, Jr., George C. Vaillant, A. V. Kidder, Ralph Linton, Gordon R. Willey, George I. Quimby, Jr., James B. Griffin, J. Alden Mason and George C. M. Engerrand. Waring has very generously supplied me with new data and ideas, and aided in rounding out the material presented here so as to be integrated with further studies which he is planning. Thus it is to be hoped that the problem of the "Southern Cult" will be approached from time to time from different angles by different persons. 2 Phillips, 1940.

Some items of this paraphernalia have been found at nearly every site of this period which has been thoroughly investigated. However, some of the larger centers have be- come well known for the quantity of these materials which they have yielded. Outstand- ing are the Kincaid and Angell sites near the mouth of the Ohio River, the Etowah site in north Georgia, Moundville in central Alabama, and Spiro in eastern Oklahoma. Although the cult which spread these objects probably flourished about 1600, there are some finds showing that certain features, at least, lasted until after 1700. The suggestion of Mexican influence in these objects has been recognized [by Phillips]. Aside from that, there is a great temptation to interpret these objects as evi- dence of some sort of religious revival quite similar in purpose to the well known Ghost Dance cult of the Plains. This, also, may be the evidence of a reaction to the rapid decimation of the population of a formerly vigorous and thriving culture. This cult was only of incidental interest to Ford and Willey in their larger scheme of interpretation. It is notable that they imply an indigenous origin as a religious revivalism, an alternative to the usual belief in Middle American inspiration. Recently, Griffin4 has presented an interesting suggestion that the Spanish expedition under Tristan de Luna in 1559-1561 furnished the means whereby Mexican Indians could have acted as the agents for the introduction of a ceremonial cult directly into the central parts of the Southeast. This argument presumes that the archaeological material such as that mentioned by Ford and Willey (above) actually denotes a single, cohesive, ceremonial complex which spread from a single source; and that. its inspiration was derived from somewhere in southern Mexico. If one accepts this much, the following points are in favor of the De Luna thesis: 1. The date of the expedition agrees on the whole with what is considered by some Southeastern archaeologists the most probable time of the cult spread. That is, the specimens considered can unquestionably be correlated with the shell-tempered pottery horizon from the Mississippi valley to central Georgia. The work of Lewis and Kneberg' in eastern Tennessee, for example, has brought about the tentative opinion that the shell-temper and cult-bearing Dallas Focus communities existed at about the time of De Soto's explorations; that is, roughly the middle 16th century. 2. It is the first concrete proposal as to the ways and means of late Mexican influence in the Southeast which helps to overcome the difficulties inposed by the lack of clear Mexican traits north of the Tampico region. To the present * Griffin, 1944. 5 Lewis and Kneberg, 1941, pp. 18-19.</page><page sequence="3">xRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 485 day there is no evidence whatever that any elements especially characteristic of Middle America were diffused overland or along the Texas Gulf coast to the Mississippi valley. Not until early in 1945 did a real analysis of the late Southeastern "cult" material appear in print. Up to this time, there had been much talk about the cult, and archaeologists seemed to assume that everyone knew what was to be included by this term. The account by Waring and Holder,' however, now gives us a solid basis on which to carry on the fascinating problems raised by this material. These authors list, illustrate, and describe what they consider the direct and indirect manifestations of a religious cult. These elements are traced through the three great centers of Spiro, Moundville, and Etowah, together with certain other occurrences. They are grouped under four heads: I. Motifs, II. God-Animal Representations, III. Ceremonial Objects, and IV. Costume. Also for the first time, some of the amazing Spiro Mound material, scattered over the land in many collections, is made available to archaeologists. It will be supposed through the following discussions that the reader is familiar with the elements and definitions given by Waring and Holder. The present paper is concerned with (1) broad areal distinctions in the specimens which are taken to represent a cult (or series of cults); (2) a comparison of stylistic treatment, especially in regard to the human figure, between the Southeastern specimens and depictions in Mexico proper and the Maya area; (3) a consideration of the, possibilities for indigenous development of the Southeastern art styles and "cult" objects; (4) indications that the religious phenomena which these objects seemingly represent reached the fullest point of development some time--perhaps a century or so--before the time of De Soto and De Luna, and then continued locally with diminishing intensity, lingering in some cases until European times. My own position on this problem is that of an archaeologist working in that region which is most frequently speculated upon in the matter of overland connections between Middle America and the eastern states, and between the Southwest and Southeast. Further, the entire matter of establishing the time of the cult spread is of considerable importance in the alignment of culture complexes in Texas in relation to adjoining areas. THE NATURE OF THE SOUTHERN CULT Although the primary interest of the present paper is historical, i.e., whether the Southern Cult was of Middle Anierican or of indigenous origin, it is necessary first to try to determine the nature of the religious phenomenon with which we are working. The basic question, to my mind, is whether or not all of the material in the late Southeast which seems to be of a ceremonial nature can be taken to represent the workings of a single "cult". Or, do the * Waring and Holder, 1945.</page><page sequence="4">486 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 specimens represent a series of cults, each of which was locally emphasized? This question cannot be answered at the present time, but in time it may be, through more such strict and detailed studies as that of Waring and Holder. These authors take the view that despite the fact that "The motifs appear disproportionately from site to site... " ... there exists at the core a basic group of elements and a basic stylistic similarity in all of the material. The same motifs, the same god-animal representations and the same ceremonial objects are present. The same conventionalizations of the rattlesnake are seen, the same drafting of the human profile, the same ear [eye?] treatment and the same treatment and grouping of motifs... Another important point is the ubiquitous manner in which elements of the complex appear again and again in the midst of otherwise unrelated groups ... Thus it would seem that the complex represents something late and specialized, something which could reappear essentially intact in unrelated groups a thousand miles apart. In short, the complex reflects the existence of a pre-Columbian cult which swept through the late prehistoric Southeast very much as the Ghost Dance swept from tribe to tribe across the Plains in the late nineteenth century ... 7 This is to say that all of the Southeastern ceremonial objects reflect the spread and local interpretation of a single "core complex". The local differences are then "explicable in terms of the previous ceremonial life and basic eco- nomics of the subareas under consideration." While I admit the logic of the stand taken by Waring and Holder, I am unable as yet to shake off the impression that the Southeastern material as a whole represents the operation of several interrelated ritualistic complexes. The principal reason for this lies in the considerable areal differences in emphasis or preoccupation with certain forms and motifs, to the exclusion or neglect of others. These shifts in emphasis are actually much greater than can be shown with a table of presences and absences. Further, such intermediate areas as the St. Francis and Tennessee-Cumberland, not discussed by Waring and Holder, provide many notable contrasts with the great centers of Spiro, Etowah, and Moundville, and will no doubt have something to say as to the content and time of occurrence of the cult. Some of the areal differences in cult material which seem most significant follow. For example, in the Tennessee-Cumberland culture, and especially in the recently defined Dallas Focus of eastern Tennessee,8 there is a decided pre- occupation with the making of conch-shell gorgets on which are engraved such motifs as the rattlesnake with its body divided into four segments by small circles, the body forming a loop with the head in its center; with the looped square. which supports bird heads on its sides; the spider, the woodpecker, turkey, and perhaps other birds; disks with lobed perimeter and "voluted" 7 Idem, pp. 21, 28, 29. 8 Lewis and Kneberg, 1941, pp. 12-20.</page><page sequence="5">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 487 center; variations of the cross and swastika either ipcised on or cut through the shell; the chunkee player; and such preternatural human representations as the "anthropomorphized eagles" or "eagle beings". The last-mentioned are essentially human figures but are equipped with very large, almost body- length wings, claws on hands or feet, deer-antler headdresses and other paraphernalia. They are shown in various postures: seated cross-legged, kneel- ing, dancing, fighting (identical pairs face to face), or holding a long blade in one hand and a severed human head in the other. In this area are also found most of the shell masks or "mask gorgets" with the forked eye symbol and/or zig-zag lines running down the cheeks.9 Other items which probably had only an indirect connection with the Southern Cult, such as pottery jars modeled as death heads, vessels represent- ing the full human figure with ribs showing (indicating death?), and negative- painted pottery,1' all seem to be concentrated in the Tennessee-Ctimberland and central Mississippi (St. Francis) basin. The ceremonial material from Mound C, Etowah, reveals some parallels with Tennessee-Cumberland, as might be expected on the basis of proximity. These parallels are, however, quite restricted. The "anthropomorphized eagle" gorgets mentioned above are well represented, as are the woodpecker and turkey. On the other hand, the rattlesnake, spider, chunkee player, hand-and- eye, looped square, "voluted" disk, shell mask, winged serpent, and several other elements listed by Waring and Holder are evidently absent from this association.11 Where birds are depicted at Etowah, they are executed in very different manner on the two.media of copper and shell. On the gorgets, small birds such as the woodpecker are carved in identical, opposed pairs in side view. On the copper plaques, a large aggressive-looking bird usually referred to as an eagle is embossed in full view centered on the underside, with large oval spots on the body and the head turned to either the right or left side. Other embossed plates show the dancing figure or "anthropomorphized eagle" hold- ing a trophy head, which, together with the bird plates, form a striking Etowah trait very rarely found elsewhere. 9 A good range of conch-shell gorgets from the Dallas Focus may be seen in Lewis and IKneberg, 1941, pl. III. For others from Tennessee and Kentucky see Holmes, 1883; Peet, 1903, figs. on pp. 265, 285, 308. Many of these are reproduced in Phillips, 1940, and Waring and Holder, 1945. 10 See Willey and Phillips, 1944, and Phillips, 1940, pp. 358-359, for discussions of this technique in the Southeast and its possible connections with Middle America. n There are rattlesnake gorgets from the Etowah village site in the museum of the R. S. Peabody Foundation, Andover, Massachusetts. Waring informs me that there are shell masks from Etowah village in the hands of the Tumlin family, owners of the site, and of Mr. Wofford of Atco, Georgia, and that there is a fragmentary specimen at Andover. Waring believes the village specimens to be of later date than the ceremonial material from Etowah mound C, thus representing specializations in the cult complex after its main development.</page><page sequence="6">488 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 Moundville likewise reveals many distinctions and shifts in emphasis which lend it an artistic and ceremonial character of its own. Its copper work was devoted principally to pendants, some oblong with disks and eye-ip-hand symbols incised or cut-out, others with curvilinear designs or eye symbols embossed upon them, and cut-out disks with crosses in their centers. Although at least one splendid copper standard or "hair ornament" was found by Moore, the copper plates and shell gorgets characteristic of Etowah and Tennessee- Cumberland are on the whole quite foreign to Moundville. True, the "eagle" itself is present, but appears in such representations as a limestone effigy pipe, and as one of many unique engravings on pottery and stone palettes. These motifs include winged serpents with tuft-like protrusions from the head which may be plumes or horns; skulls; hands; eye-in-hand; arm and leg bones, etc.12 Waring and Holder have pointed out that the bi-lobed arrow motif is common here and rare elsewhere, and that cult designs "were used freely on the en- graved grave wares in village site burials as well as mound burials throughout the site"-i.e., at Moundville they seem to have been the property of com- moners as well as of specialists or priests. Thus the Moundville material reveals many striking objects of copper, stone, and pottery, and a strong predilection for winged serpents, death, and eye symbols, while shell work was neglected. Further, one notes little concern with the winged being, and no portrayals of deer or of trophy heads at this site. Turning to Spiro, much of the "capriciousness and abandon" discussed by Waring and Holder was probably due to the fact that Spiro artists used the greater surface provided by whole conch shells and trimmed-down conch bowls, rather than gorgets.13 Design elements which are used throughout the rest of the Southeast with consider- able conventionality and restraint are used at Spiro with what appears to be utter capriciousness and abandon. Such technical, innovations as full face representation, bas relif, and shell carving in the round are seen. Many of the old, familiar elements are distorted into new and bizarre forms. Thus we see serpents with seven deer's heads, copper-covered wooden representations of flint knives and human beings with serpent bodies issuing from their backs. The designs on the conch shell bowls are completely wild and many strange and unrelated elements appear... Although gorgets are comparatively rare here, the turkey is easily recog- 12 Moore, 1905 and 1907. For the northern Alabama area see Webb and De Jarnette, 1942; note that in the data presented in table 45 for six Pickwick components related to Moundville, the engraved death symbols did not occur. 13 The Harry M. Trowbridge collection from Spiro Mound, housed in the Kansas City Museum, contains 63 whole and fragmentary engraved shells and only one gorget. However, the T. M. Sanders site in Lamar County, Texas, has yielded more gorgets than whole shells. Here the gorgets agree with Spiro (turkey, full human face in relief, etc.) but the shell bowls bear only simple lines and triangles. Three decorated bowl fragments found by C. H. Webb in Belcher burials, northwest Louisiana, are being described by him.</page><page sequence="7">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 489 nized. The innovation of full view of the human face appears on both gorgets and whole shells. Other extremely interesting depictions include a Puebloan- like zig-zag lightning (?) symbol over the head of an anthropomorphized bird with wings in place of arms; a scene in which two facing figures hold their hands toward an upright forked pole (possibly a maize stalk?) while speech symbols (?) emerge from their mouths; and another showing two human figures from whose backs emerge two intertwined rattlesnake bodies differ- ently decorated, while at their feet is a third rattlesnake, coiled.14 These fig- urations are indeed startling and unique, especially in the vigor of their treat- ment. What is more, Spiro seems to provide nearly all of the few Southeastern elements of the ceremonial complex which are closely comparable to Middle American motifs. While Spiro shows remarkably close connection with Etowah in its copper work, especially in the occurrence of embossed plates showing the winged dancer with trophy head, and the warrior (?) head shown in left profile, the shell engravings in these two centers are quite distinct. The cross-legged dignitary with wings and deer-antler headdress has not appeared at Spiro, nor has the "fighting warrior" motif. There is nothing like the Moundville death symbols (skulls, bones) engraved on pottery and stone disks, nor copper gorgets and pendants. Shell masks, shell temper in pottery, negative-painted ware, and human effigy pottery are also probably absent. These differences, though admittedly given very sketchily, could be multiplied. There is no question, on the other hand, that many artifacts, motifs, details such as the forked eye and barred-oval symbols, and a generally free, lively style are surprisingly similar in these areas. The question raised is one of process: are we dealing with local selection, reinterpretation, and specialization operating within a single rapid religious movement; or, do we have a springing to life, as it were, of several mythological and ritualistic concepts through the ability of some Southeastern tribes to portray them in naturalistic fashion? In other words, granting that these artifacts represent religious concepts, it is equally remarkable that these people could produce accurate, lively, and lifelike illustrations of the things they felt about creatures of nature, man, man's relationship to these creatures, and even the accom- panying ritualistic paraphernalia. The possible source of this ability is thus no less of a problem than the nature and origin of the motifs and representa- tions themselves. One of the fundamental precepts of archaeological thinking should be that specimens are not so much objects to be classified, but the concrete, overt expressions of the mental and social world in which their makers lived. Thus, the depictions executed on shell, copper plates, in modelings and sculptures, 14 Kelemen, 1943, vol. II, pls. 280b, c; Waring and Holder, 1945, fig. Vb, e, h.</page><page sequence="8">490 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 are actually but the surface indications of certain mental patterns. In the present case they seem to reflect beliefs in ritualisms, in supernatural creatures and their magic powers, division of the universe into quarters or "winds", perhaps also matters of social status, rank, heraldry, and other aspects of the mental life of the times. Certainly many profound concepts of cosmogenesis and the spirit world were fostered all through the New World, and with the general spread of agriculture became modified or intensified in various ways. The main point is that the Southeastern "cult" objects should be considered as expressive of more deep-seated social phenomena than the mere manu- facture of the specimens found by the archaeologist.15 The kind of religion represented by the Southeastern artifacts should be determined, if possible. Certainly ethnological studies have brought to light a rich variety of religious complexes in North America. Though I am not closely familiar with any of these, several possible analogies come to mind: messianic cults such as the Ghost and Prophet Dances; warrior-exploit cults (such as Toltec and Aztec "warrior cults"); ritualisms devoted to nature spirits (like the California Kuksu cult); god-impersonations, usually per- formed with masks (Puebloans, Middle Americans); rituals of propagation and fertilization (Puebloans, Middle Americans); mythological dramatizations (e.g., Hidatsa bird ceremony dealing with constant conflict between the Thunderbirds and water monster); complex festivals of heterogeneoits pur- poses (Sun Dance); etc. In two cases cited above, the rapidity of spread of the Southeastern cult has been compared to that of the Ghost Dance. Aside from the fact that the Ghost Dance diffusion was facilitated by comparatively modern transporta- tion, it may be questioned that the Southern Cult was also of a messianic nature. Ford and Willey, we have seen, suggest that this was the case, this "religious revival" taking place as "a reaction to the rapid decimation" of a formerly vigorous population. Griffin16 has taken exception to this view, suggesting that the spread of the cult took place when Southeastern culture was "at its apogee". To judge only from its western outposts in eastern Oklahoma and northeasit Texas, I would agree with Griffin, for here the cult specimens have been found in sites which evidently were occupied by a comparatively rich and prosperous people. There is, moreover, no hint of contact with Europeans at this time; when the historic horizon is reached there are no specimens to be found in this region which can be referred to the cult. 15 In this connection, Spinden's A Study of Maya Art, esp. pp. 236-245, should be read by everyone interested in the problem of the "Southern Cult". Though more than thirty years old, Spinden's lucid and sensible discussion of religious art and symbolism, the tremendous distribu- tion of beliefs in plumed and horned serpents and their possibilities as artistic subjects over and above religious meaning, is still quite applicable to the present problem. 16 Griffin, 1944.</page><page sequence="9">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 491 Waring and Holder have already listed some of the Southeastern cult elements as god-animal representations, among them the "anthropomorphized eagle" and the "anthropomorphized rattlesnake". Besides these, there are such incongruities as the serpent with six deer heads from Spiro. While it is too early in this study to make any conclusive statements, it appears to the writer that the Southern Cult material represents rich and varied mythological conceptions and god-impersonations as well. In other words, possible analogies to the messianic Ghost Dance, "warrior cults", rituals of propagation, and the like, do not, to me, appear as likely as those dealing with animal spirits and mythology. With the foundation for thi5 approach already laid by Waring and Holder, further work should result in most interesting disclosures on this fascinating subject. The entire problem of the Southern Cult is of first-rate importance in American anthropology. Approached carefully, it provides a superb op- portunity for specialists in archaeology, religion, mythology, linguistic rela- tions, etc. to combine their efforts in the solution of a complex problem. It embraces practically all the methodological tools and points of view in anthro- pology: diffusion versus parallelism, outside influence versus originality, problems of change, elaboration, selection, reinterpretation, rate of spread, and the like. There is no easy solution. Some matters of stylistic comparison with Middle America will now be considered. It may be emphasized again that these notes are only suggestive and by no means conclusive. COMPARISONS WITH MEXICO AND THE MAYA The Southeastern ceremonial artifacts reveal fully as much interest in various creatures of nature as in man himself. The more common representa- tions are of the deer (as seen in antler headdresses), the rattlesnake, horned17 and winged serpents with rattlesnake tails, eagle or eagle-like bird, woodpecker, turkey, spider, and cat-like animals. The only attitudes of violence are in fighting "eagles" or "eagle men". Certain dancing figures hold severed heads but their attitudes do not suggest any fierceness. The rattlesnakes and winged serpents nowhere reveal the oppressive ferocity of Middle American forms, nor does a human being ever appear emerging from their mouths. There is nothing present like the jaguar in its manifold Middle American forms, though this of course may be due to geographical factors.18 There are no gods or 17 Although Waring and Holder listed the plumed rattlesnake for Spiro, Moundville, and Etowah, Waring has recently written me that whereas serpents are definitely shown as horned in all localities, there is nowhere a clear case of a plumed serpent. This point may have unusual significance in the field of comparisons with Middle America. 18 The famous stone "cat pipes" such as that shown by Moore from Moundville (Moore, 1905, figs. 1-3) somewhat suggest a jaguar but this is conjectural.</page><page sequence="10">492 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 goddesses of destruction, bloodshed, sacrifice; no female figures of any kind. We see no scenes of interaction such as homage, punishment, or processional ritual, nothing comparable to the swarming activity of Mexican murals and codices. The Southeastern shell gorgets usually portray but one human figure. In the few cases where two are shown, such as the "fighting eagle men", the figures are identical and face one another in bilateral "mirror symmetry". Designs on Spiro whole shells and dippers do not quite conform to this prin- ciple, some dual figures being much alike but not exactly so.19 In general, birds are shown either as units or in bisymmetrical pairs, rattlesnakes likewise, spiders singly in the center of a disk, and so on. Copper plates show only single "eagles" or "anthropomorphized eagles", except in rare cases where a reversed composite is affected.20 Where dual figures are seen, whether human, bird, or rattlesnake, the effect i? automatically pleasing to one's sense of balance. What impresses one more is the skillful control of balance in single human figures. The running man on a Spiro shell, for example, is perfectly executed in a series of com- pensating planes-right forearm with left thigh and foot, left forearm with right thigh and left lower leg, shoulders with knees, and so on. Likewise, the copper-plate dancing figures of Etowah are expertly balanced and counter- poised-the wand or mace in the right hand counterbalances the heavy head- dress, the trophy head in the left hand counterbalances the upraised right knee, and the two great wings equalize the whole background. It may not be far wrong to state that those who argue most strongly for Middle American influence on this art base their case mainly on the skill and technical virtuosity with which these representations are drawn. It is thus inconceivable to some that such an art could have been achieved independently of the influence of Middle American masters. Yet Phillips has considered the matter in these terms: The Southwest, I believe, has passed through a similar experience--has only lately achieved a grudging independence from the Middle American hegemony. Will the Southeast be able to do the like? Let us compare style in these areas in more detail. Pre-Conquest codex figures from Highland Mexico, which have been a favorite source of reference, are for the most part awkward looking, drawn in stiff, flat-footed poses, with oversized heads, noses, and legs. The feet appear too large, with toes spread out, though this is not always the case. Costumes are commonly shown with 19 Note the Spiro engravings shown by Waring and Holder, fig. Ve, h. In e there are differ- ences in facial markings, and in h discrepancies can be seen in the belts, objects held in the out- ward hands, the oblong objects behind the heads, and decoration of the serpent bodies. 20 This difficult technique of reverse opposition is like that on the face cards of a playing deck. Examples may be seen in Etowah Papers, fig. 9; Moore, 1907, fig. 9.</page><page sequence="11">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 493 stiff lines without good perspective, and the whole figure greatly overburdened with a multiplicity of plumes and exaggerated appendages. Withal, a sort of impishness pervades this graphic art of the late Highland tribes, and also appears in the earlier murals of Teotihuacan. In Mexican stone sculptures and relipfs, two figures shown in opposition may balance well, but the persons and their paraphernalia are rarely, if ever, identical,21 or executed in the "mirror symmetry" of the Southeast. In striking contrast, the treatment of the human figure in the Southeastern area gives an impression of grace and realism. Head, arms, torso, and. legs are drawn in good proportion, the feet small and well formed. Whether the person shown is seated, kneeling, dancing, or running, the legs are separated and flexed in an easy, lifelike manner. The perspective is good, and in some cases what amounts to a quarter view is accomplished when the head is turned in the opposite direction from that ip which the body is facing. In spite of the fact that masks, wings, claws, complex headdresses with mounted standards, scepters, and other insignia are shown in these depictions, they do not interfere too much. with the essential cleanness of line which characterizes all this work. There also appears to be a strong tendency (Spiro again excepted) to show the head of single human figures in left profile, no matter which way the body is drawn. In this basic cleanness of line, lifelike posturing, good proportion, oc- casional use of quarter view, preference for left profile of the head, and freedom from flamboyancy, the Southeastern treatment of the human figure is decidedly more suggestive of certain late Maya styles of Yucatan than it is of Mexico proper. While Yucatan culture was heavily influenced by Mexico, such cities as Chichen Itza reveal an artistic development which, in freedom of line and naturalism, seems to be quite independent of any Mexican tradition.22 When the art of Chichen Itza is compared with that of the Southern Maya and of the Nahuas, it must be acknowledged that, at his best, the Chichen artist equals the best Mexican work, but is inferior to the best in the southern area. It is, however, im- portant to add that he was an original artist. This is a thing that is often denied, it would seem, because of confusion between subject-matter and style. There is no n Examples of this balance in dual portrayal, but with differences in detail on the two sides, may be seen in Caso, 1928, esp. figs. 50, 52, 55, 80-84, 93, 94. For dualism which is very close to bisymmetry, see the Mexican bas-reliefs in Monumentos Arqueol6gicos de Mexico, pp. 139-142. 22Compare, for example, Highland Mexico codex drawings with frescos on the Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itza, as reproduced in Vaillant, 1940, pp. 54-55; also Spinden, 1913, fig. 12. Edward H. Thompson, 1904, presents reproductions in color of murals at Tzula (pl. II) and Chacmultun (pl. VIII) which, in their lifelike postures, freedom of line, and slight amount of clothing, might be compared with the Southeastern human figures. Morris, Charlot, and Morris, 1931, figs. 25, 27, 289, also illustrate this tendency toward simplification. A convenient com- parison of "pure Maya murals" and those at Chichen Itza may be seen in Kelemen, 1943, vol. II, pls. 262, 263.</page><page sequence="12">494 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 doubt that many, though not all, of the details in this work (god-masks, garments, weapons) can be traced to identical representations in the Southern Maya area or in Mexico, but it is also true that this by no means affects the originality of the Chichen style. There is great disparity, in fact incompatibility, between the acute realism of the Warriors Temple art and the idealism of the Southern Maya style. A comparison with Mexico is even more striking. The extreme elongation of the Chichen figures is absolutely incompatible with the Mexican's love for short, squat representations. These are two very different concepts of beauty. The few sculptures found in Teotihua- can, also, when compared with Chichen carvings, are found to be utterly unlike. The Mexican sculptures show a love for abstract geometrization carried to extremes, es- pecially in the treatment of the human figures, a tendency typified by the Goddess of Agriculture in the National Museum of Mexico. The Mexican transformed his model into a new form that retained only a few points of contact with natural appearances. In Chichen, on the contrary, a most exact love of nature predominated. Beyond a doubt, whatever foreign influences reached the Chichen artist were grafted upon an already vigorous native style."3 While late Maya art in the Yucatan peninsula presumably agrees better in time with the Southeastern "cult" figurations, it may be well to point out that the criteria of "cleanness of lipe, good proportion, use of quarter view, freedom from flamboyancy", etc., are somewhat better answered in relief carvings of certain older Maya cities of the Usumacinta region than they are in Yucatan. Thus, Spinden24 has discussed a number of low reliefs at Yaxchilan which, he says, constitute an interesting departure from the usual Maya front and side views in that they are quarter-view and "the attitudes are all ex- ceptionally free." The same authority also notes a similarity in masterful carving in the full round and in a "three-quarter view" in such early Maya cities as Piedras Negras, Copan, and Quirigua.25 He speaks of a "new desire for realism" in the art of Piedras Negras, illustrated by Mason26 in certain remarkable carvings which employ a technique of high relief in which the figures stand out from the background. It is precarious, however, to attempt close comparisons in artistic styles applied to such different media as plaster, stone, and shell. Moreover, Southeastern art does not employ a grouping of several human figures in the Maya manner. In this connection, the portrayal in the Southeast of a dignitary in seated position with legs crossed, shown in full-front view with head turned to the viewer's left, ip also of considerable interest. There is, of course, no lack of such a seated figure in side view in the reliefs, frescoes, and codices of Mexico, but the front view with turned head seems to be peculiarly Maya in reliefs, jades, and pottery decoration alike."2 At the same time, the seated Southeastern Morris, Charlot, and Morris, 1931, p. 343. 24 Spinden, 1913, pp. 29-30. 2 Idem, pp. 190-192.

This incongruity of antler headdress28 combined with a bird (?) mask and large wings may indeed lead one to ask whether the "eagle men" of the South- east are really analogous to the Mexican figures disguised as eagles. In the Mexican codex drawings, and in such carvings as those on wooden drums, there can be little question that the bird depicted is the eagle, for it is presented in very realistic fashion. The same applies to men covered from head to foot with an eagle disguise. In the Southeast, on the other hand, the large birds and "eagle men" are portrayed in an entirely different fashion. Where the bird alone is depicted, as on the copper plates of Etowah, the wing feathers are drawn with long, nearly straight lines, which curve only at the tips and shoulders. The tail is indicated by a fan-shaped area without individual feathers. The body is spotted with oval areas, and the eye has the typical forked "tear-drop" area. "Eagle beipgs" embossed or incised on copper and shell bear wings and tails drawn in exactly the same fashion as those on the copper birds themselves. A gorget figure in profile may have but one wing, a front-view seated figure two, but the wings are drawn with the same straight-line symmetry in all cases.29 Both copper and shell figures are also equipped with claws on the feet or on one or both hands. Sometipmes they are apparently masked with bird- like beaks. It is also important to note that the Southeastern men, in addition to being equipped with these very un-Mexican wings, do not have any ap- parent feather headdresses. Instead, headdresses consist either of large two- lobed standards and other peculiar objects, deer antlers, or (rarely) a simula- tion of a sipgle plume. Thus, if Southeastern and Mexican "eagle men" are set up for comparison, there is very little in common except that they are men and are shown in Thompson, 1939, figs. 83, 84, 89, etc., illustrates vessels with this motif that belong to San Jose V, the Mexican-contact period. The cross-legged dignitary in front view has been found as a repeti- tious unit in relief on the temple of Xochicalco, Morelos, Mexico. The stylistic treatment with flamboyant scroll work is, however, more Maya than Mexican. Vaillant, 1940, p. 31, reproduces this temple with the note that it is of "Nahua architecture" while the frieze is in "Mixtec-Zapotec art style". Nuttall, 1932, pp. 141-142, also recognized this posture as strange to Mexico proper. 28 It has been suggested that these "antlers" may be plumes that happen to look like antlers. There is no doubt in my mind that they are antlers. Waring has recently uncovered a shell gorget in the Bureau of American Ethnology Archives which indicates almost beyond question that a deer is represented by this headdress. This specimen, probably from Big Toco Mound in eastern Tennessee, shows the usual "anthropomorphized eagle" with trophy head and flint knife, while over the left shoulder is a small deer head with its own antlers. 29 Thomas, 1891, p. 307, while claiming many points of comparison between Etowah figures and "Mexico" and "Central America", nevertheless says of these wings: ". . . the artist had in mind the angel figure with wings rising from the back of the shoulders-an idea wholly foreign to Mexican art."</page><page sequence="14">496 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 ritualistic relationship to a great bird of some kind.30 Spinden's suggestion31 that "these Southeastern eagle men may be no other than the miraculous thunder birds of mythology" will bear serious consideration. Willoughby32 informs us that a Creek migration legend involves two wonderful beings in the form of birds: one, the eagle, the other a great blue bird even swifter than the eagle. Holmes,33 in commenting on the shell figures, mentions the great extent of North American myths involving a large and powerful bird. It seems possible--in fact, probable-that the copper birds and the "eagle beings"34 in shell and copper actually express a mythological concept held in common with many other peoples, including Middle American tribes. Such similarities as may be seen may thus easily be due to convergence rather than borrowing. That some of the "eagle beings" clutch trophy heads does not require a Middle American explanation either. Much the same thing may be said about the horned and winged serpents in Southeastern art. The light manner in which these are drawn does not compare closely with Mexican or Maya serpents, but is more remindful of those painted on some Puebloan and Peruvian pottery. At any rate, the Southeasterners undoubtedly shared a common belief in the powers of mythical water monsters and serpents with all of agricultural America, and with non-agricultural peoples as well.35 There are, on the other hand, a few elements which may prove to be more indicative of direct Middle American influence. Among these are the symbol- izations of death, quite apart from trophy heads. It has been mentioned that these are found most frequently in the central portions of the Southeast, most notably at Moundville, and do not appear to be a constant part of a general cult throughout the Southeast. 30 No greater contrast could be made than that provided by Zelia Nuttall (1932, fig. 90) to illustrate the "resemblance" in the "eagle lords" in the two regions. Likewise, the Maya codex figure selected by Shetrone (1936, fig. 73) for placement with the two Etowah copper birdmen "to indicate the similarity" appears to me little less than ridiculous. This grotesque creature is no more like the Etowah dancers than a random selection from any part of the earth. 31 Spinden, 1913, p. 246. 32 Willoughby, 1932, p. 54. 33 Holmes, 1883, pp. 280-281. * I have so far refrained from a commitment as to whether or not the winged figures on the coppei and shell objects represent eagles and anthropomorphizations thereof. Waring and Holder have called attention to the forked-eye symbols on these creatures as a natural marking of the Falconidae. Possibly this marking was first derived thus from nature, then subsequently applied to other figures as a designatory symbol. On the other hand, I believe it possible that the great birds are not specifically eagles but merely possess some attributes of the same. "Eagle being" is perhaps a suitable term, although "winged being" would be less committal and could also include the winged figure with antlers. 35 E.g., Radin, 1932, p. 296, describes a sacred wheel of the Arapaho which combined sym- bolic representations of a water serpent, thunderbirds, eagles, sky (blue beads), world quarters, etc.</page><page sequence="15">KRrEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 497 The depiction of skulls, death heads, arm bones, and crossed bones is of wide distribution in southern Mexico and the Maya area. The death head was a day sign in the calendars of both areas. Skulls were carved in long rows on the walls of such widely separated places as Tula in central Mexico and Chichen Itza in Yucatan.3 It seems impossible to pin this principle down to any particular locality as a most likely source-and there is no assurance that the elements carried the same functional significance in these areas. Yet of all cult elements supposed to have been derived from "Mexico", skull and bone symbols provide the closest analogy and the most likely evidence for a direct introduction. Another intriguing matter concerns the masks shown on gorget and plaque figures. In most cases the mask seems simply to indicate a bird beak, but a gorget from New Madrid County, Missouri," plainly shows a runner wearing a mask with a long, curved projection which conceivably might be compared with that of the Maya "long-nosed god""38 or its Nahua counterpart, the rain god Tlaloc. Against these few specific points of comparison, many typical Maya and Mexican accessories are notably absent from the Southeastern work. The following are the more obvious: glyphs; speech scrolls;39 long, body-length feathered staffs held in one or both hands with the butt end sometimes resting on the ground; spears; shields; banners; atlatls; atlatl darts; "Maya" nose sticks; "Nahua" nose plugs; clothing other than a knotted loin cloth; altars; seats or thrones; steps; maize; trees; direct contact with serpents; and probably many others. There is no scroll work whatever either upon the figure or in the background. Major differences in subject matter and style have already been mentioned. 36For an analysis of death heads and death masks in relief in the Temple of the Chac Mool and the Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itza, see Morris, Chariot, and Morris, 1931, figs. 196, 226, 290, 291. Certain distinctions in stylization are correlated with the two buildings. Various representations of bones and death in the codices and Maya art may be found in Spinden, 1913, fig. 115. 37 Thruston, 1897, pl. 17. 38 Morris, Chariot, and Morris, 1931, figs. 197, 199, 227, 228, illustrate a variety of grotesque bird-masks and god-masks which take somewhat different forms at the Temple af the Chac Mool and the Temple of the Warriors. Hands and long-nosed masks, both of copper sheeting, have been found in the Gahagan Mound in northwest Louisiana, a site which has not yielded any of the "Southern Cult" material (Webb and Dodd, 1939, pl. 29). Similar copper masks were found by Moore in the Grant Mound on St. John's river, Florida (Moore, 1896, pp. 486-487). The noses on these masks are straight, unlike the scroll-shaped mask on the Missouri gorget figure. It may also be noted that anthropomorphized bird-beings with large wings and long-beaked masks are portrayed on Peruvian pottery (Montell, 1929, figs. 48-49). 39 Shetrone, 1936, fig. 246, illustrates one of the engraved creatures on Moundville pottery with what "are believed to be speech symbols." These projections do not seem to be anything but tongues. The Spiro dual figures shown by Waring and Holder, fig. Ve, provide the only close analogy to speech symbols so far found in the Southeast.</page><page sequence="16">498 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 Southeastern accessories which are unique include the short "bilobed arrow" standards and "badges" shown- mounted on the heads of dancers holdipg trophy heads; tasseled wands or standards held in the right hand of the same figures;40 peculiar rectangular objects fastened to the headdress, which presumably represent still other insignia; the beaded forelock; and an odd pointed object hanging from the belt or loin cloth (Spinden's "heart- shaped apron"), possibly intended to be an ornamented conch shell or a beaded pouch. While the hand is a common enough subject for artistic expression among primitive peoples, the use of an eye symbol centered in the palm seems to have had a special magical meaning in the Southeast. Regarding now some of the more material aspects of possible "Mexican" origin of the more spectacular items in the Middle Mississippi horizon, Mason4' and Webb and DeJarnette42 have reviewed the distribution of certain artifacts. Mason concludes that only the most general resemblances may be seen be- tween such "elements" in Mexico and the eastern United States as: seated human figures, sculptured idol heads, truncated pyramids, spool-shaped ear- plugs, tripod vessels, plumed serpent, art of engraved shell gorgets. Though I think there is more to the possibilities for comparison than Mason did, he is correct in his opinion that Nuttall, Moorehead, and Spinden were able to build only very flimsy (over-general) cases for diffusion by some vague warrior cults coming out of "Mexico". He also argued that the chance for independent development of some of these items is high. Webb and DeJarnette have compiled distribution data and mapped the occurrence of five "special forms" of artifacts in the Southeast, the Indies, and Middle America. Theiy study reveals the astonishing fact that not a single example of any of these forms has been authentically reported from Mexico, including Yucatan. Three of them-circular stone palettes with incised designs, "stone images",43 and copper pendants with disks and hands incised on them-are evidently confined to parts of the Southeast and are therefore indigenous.44 Yet the three have very distinct total distributions even here. 40 For these various batons, standards, "badges" or whatever they are, see Etowah Papers, figs. 17-18, 20-21. It is interesting that these symbols portrayed with the human figures have themselves been found as copper plates. 41 Mason, 1937, pp. 120-129. 42 Webb and DeJarnette, 1942, pp. 286-300. 43 These differ from stone idols in that they are sometimes found in graves and appear to represent attempts to preserve the features of inidividuals; idols are sculptures erected in sacred places. 44 Webb and DeJarnette, table 38, include two small images reported by Holmes from Panama as the only examples from outside the Southeast. The two examples from western Mississippi might possibly be the heads of stone effigy pipes rather than "images", thus throwing the principal distribution far inland from northwestern Georgia (Etowah) to southern Illinois (Kincaid). Nuttall, 1932, p. 144, commenting on one of the remarkable stone sculptures or "im- ages", stated only that "in a general way, it recalls the primitive idols of Mexico, [yet] it has distinctive characteristics that are strange to me."</page><page sequence="17">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 499 The "spatulate" or "ceremonial" axe was found to occur also in the West Indies, British Guiana, Ecuador, and northern Peru; the "monolithic" axe in the West Indies, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The authors suggest that in view of this distribution such axes may have been "introduced into this country by way of the West Indies". The writer suggests that, in view of their relative frequency and compact distribution in the Southeast and the widely scattered, isolated occurrences in lands to the south, it is equally plausible that they might have originated in the Southeastern states and were traded or diffused from there. However, Southeastern monolithic axes are plainly copied after wooden-hafted copper celts found associated with them, always have an "eyelet" hole in the handle, and may not be related to the more southerly axes at all.45 It has long been recognized that nothing like the hammered repousse copper plaques of Etowah, the Tennessee-Cumberland culture, and Spiro is known in Middle America. The shell masks of Tennessee-Cumberland are also apparently unknown elsewhere. However, the principle of incising and cutting through shell gorgets is known in some scattered instances. A pair of shell disks has been reported from Holmul, Guatemala.46 Each reveals a portrait view in profile of the same person, but from opposite sides so that they form a matching paiy. The style is typical flamboyant Maya. Thompson47 has described in detail a group of ten shell disks from a burial at Tzimin Kax, British Honduras. Some of these bear cut-out designs, and one matching pair bears incised decoration featured by a central cross. This pair of disks was painted in four colors and they were evidently once glued to other objects, possibly to wooden ear-plugs. The burial belonged to a Holmul I period, but Thompson presents evidence that Holmul I may have lasted at this site (or did not reach here) until shortly before Holmul V.48 That is, the shells might be roughly dated at prior to the last quarter of Cycle 9, or about 750 A.D. in Thompson's correlation table.49 From Mexico engraved gorgets have been reported by Starr5o from near 4 The list of monolithic axes compiled by Webb and DeJarnette does not include the largest series yet found in a single locality in America. Mason, 1936, pp. 175-178, pls. LXXXII- LXXXIII, describes twenty-eight complete and two fragmentary specimens from the Pueblito site, and two complete axes from Nahuange, both in the Tairona region of Colombia. Several of these, like the Southeastern specimens, plainly represent hafted celts, while others were more crudely made, the axe blade being carved at right angles to the handle or crossing it like a T. The butts of many of these axes are flanged and pointed in a manner similar to the Southeastern speci- mens, but they seem not to bear the "eyelet hole". Neither does the distal extension of the handle present a curve resembling a bird head or beak. At any rate, this matter has no bearing on com- parisons between the Southeast and Mexico. 46 Merwin and Vaillant, 1932, fig. 29 and pl. 36 d, f. 47 J. Eric Thompson, 1931, pls.

These Mexican gorgets have often been held up as evidence of Middle American influence on the Middle Mississippi. Those in the Huasteca area, however, are still about one thousand miles from the nearest Southeastern specimens in extreme northeast Texas. The degree of resemblance to South- eastern gorgets is a matter which individuals will have to decide for themselves. Aside from the fact that the gorgets are incised and cut out in very much the same manner in both regions, the writer can see almost no resemblance in their depictions. It is true that both deal in part with the human figure, but the postures, style and supplementary elements are almost totally distinct. The circular gorget shown by Saville from near Tuxpan portrays a person in the act of fire drilling. This, together with the presence of a nose stick and many other details carefully noted by Saville, shows striking parallels with a Maya codex deity. Saville further remarks that "In the Nahuatl codices no deities of a like character are found." The paired shell disks shown by Beyer, like the Maya specimens cited, may not be gorgets but ornaments once glued to wooden ear plugs. Set "A" bears cloud symbols and death heads with speech scrolls. Other Huasteca gorgets are of a long triangular shape. The carving and incising are wonderfully intricate, the whole triangular space being filled with the human figures and elaborations of costumes, headdresses, and parapher- nalia. The faces of these figures are often painted. In at least two cases two intertwined serpents with upward-opened jaws fill the lower part of the field and emerge from a body of water. With scroll work in the background, presence of the nose stick, and a great many details of dress, masks, and paraphernalia, these depictions have been compared by Beyer with several deities of the Mexican codices. The style is not specifically Aztec, evidently being a Huaste- can specialization.55 51 Holmes, 1903, pp. 97-99. 52 Saville, 1900, pp. 99-103. 5 Beyer, 1933, pp. 155-213. 4 Meade, 1942, figs. 56-58, 211. This work also contains quartered disks or "Suns" with serpent heads in their centers, carved on sculptures of Tamuin (figs. 187-191), which may possibly bear on the quartered shell disks of the Southeast. 5 The two anthropomorphized serpents with differently decorated, intertwined bodies, seen on a Spiro shell (Waring and Holder, fig. Vh) are oddly remindful of the intertwined serpents carved oh several Huastec triangular gorgets (Beyer, 1933, pls. I, VIII, fig. 37). In the latter cases, the serpents are 'anthropomorphized either in the sense of growing out of human bodies (the reverse of the Spiro figure), or of full human figures being drawn above their widely-opened jaws. While the total composition is very different in these two widely separated instances, the Spiro specimen is the only one in the Southeast, in my opinion, which can be said to approach the Huastecan depictions.</page><page sequence="19">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 501 Since practically all of his shell artifacts from the vicinity of Tampico were found at Las Flores, Ekholm believes that the gorgets reported by Beyer and others belong to Period V in the Tampico sequence.5 This period Ekholm correlates with Aztec I-Mazapan.57 Even allowing for some time lag between the Valley of Mexico and Tampico, the ending date of Period V could hardly be later than 1300 A.D., or 1400 at the very extreme. This still falls some two hundred years short of the supposed time of appearance of "Cult" gorgets in the Southeast, but it may be that, as Griffin remarks, "some of our ideas of dating in the Southeast may be in for a change." Let us not insist, however, that the matter of decorating gorgets, like every- thing else unusual, "came from Mexico". We have here another example of compact distribution and relatively great frequency in the central parts of the S6utheast versus scattered distribution and great rarity in Mexico and the Maya region-and the style, shape, and function of these objects is notably different in each case. Furthermore, undecorated shell gorgets were in use in the eastern states as far back as the Archaic and Burial Mound I stages. Holmes58 has pointed out a looped square in the Vienna Codex which bears a striking resemblance to the looped squares with bird heads on gorgets of the Tennessee-Cumberland. The Codex square lacks bird heads on its sides. Holmes goes on to discuss the enormous distribution of cross and square symbols, implying thereby a strong chance of independent development. In summary, the differences between Southeastern figurations in shell and copper, and those of the codices, murals, reliefs, and shell carvings of the Mexican and Maya cultures seem to far outweigh the occasional similarities in certain details. Obviously, the interminable discussions on "Middle American influence" hinge upon what each person conceives of as a "similarity" or "resemblance". Personally, I feel that the Southeastern ceremonial representa- tions form, on the whole, a distinct development in aboriginal America, instantly recognizable when compared to the products of any other region. At the same time, it would be foolish to deny summarily that it had been subjected to any outside ipfluence. The question, rather, is what influence, where from, and when? The points which present the greatest difficulties in defining a plausible picture of Middle American influence on the late Southeast are: first, those few elements which are generally comparable in the two regions are seldom, if ever, strictly comparable; second, the Southeastern elements which, in one way or another might be taken to indicate contact and borrowing, do not consistently fall together in any particular culture complex; and third, no definite trade pieces from Middle American cultures have yet appeared in the eastern United States. " Ekholm, 1944, pp. 482-483. 37 Idem, pp. 503-504. 58 Holmes, 1883, p. 285, pl. LIX.</page><page sequence="20">502 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 47, 1945 To answer the first of these objections with the claim that culture traits are altered and re-integrated by the receiving peoples calls for an extraordinary stretching of the processes of selection, at least in the case of the "Southern Cult". As Waring has pointed out in correspondence, it may have been physically and socially impossible for highly elaborated Mexican rituals to have been borrowed and perpetuated in greatly simplified form by other groups far away. The second matter, that of the diffuse manner in which elements possibly derived from Middle America appear in the Southeastern area (whether or not they are connected with the ceremonial complex) might be explained by very occasional, small-scale communications between the two regions. Perhaps one could say that these peoples had some vague knowledge of one another, and that individuals from the Southeast may even have visited at certain of the great Mexican or Mayan ceremonial centers, returning with impressions or knowledge of techniques which were put to some use. This is speculative of course, yet it might explain the vagueness and lack of concentration in space and time of possible Middle American introductions.s5 Against this, the possibilities of a degree of convergence in ceremonial depictions, arising from social and mythological factors held in common, should be thoroughly ex- plored. The third point, lack of identifiable Middle American trade objects in the eastern states, is not conclusive evidence that the two regions were completely out of contact. The occasional visits suggested above may have taken place without any trade routes being established. It is also possible that a few such objects will eventually turn up in private collections or future excavations. For the present, if one were to make a choice between Mexican and Maya cultures as the more likely source of certain elements in the ceremonial material, the writer would strongly favor Maya for reasons mentioned throughout the discussion. Thus the generally free and lively style and good proportions in drawing the human figure, the dancing or "prancing" attitude, the full-front depiction of a dignitary in seated position with the legs crossed, masks possibly related to those of the "long-nosed" god, the symbolizations of death and perhaps some of the insignia of office, might be traced to such a source in preference to the artistic traditions characteristic of known cultures in Mexico proper. In these respects, there is considerably more agreement between the Southeastern treatment of the human figure and certain fresco 69 This stand is at variance with that taken by Phillips (1940, pp. 366-367), who sees in Middle Mississippi "a considerable number of characteristics that can only be interpreted as the result of more or less direct contact with Middle America; and that although some of the features may have been inherited from earlier cultures in the Mississippi Valley (and therefore may be regarded as only remotely Middle American in origin) the more unequivocal ones, and those which give the culture its special flavor, seem to have been introduced directly into the Southeast at a comparatively late time." What, exactly, are these "unequivocal" features?</page><page sequence="21">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 503 styles of Yucatan (such as at Chichen Itza) than there is between Highland Mexico and either the Southeast or Yucatan. An even greater resemblance in control of line and naturalistic proportioning may be observed between South- eastern figures drawn on shell and certain specialized high reliefs at such early Maya cities as Piedras Negras. However, temporal factors, as we now view them, rather preclude the possibility of Maya influence on the art style of the Southern Cult, other than during Late Empire times.60 But to reiterate: the Southern Cult ceremonial material as a whole could not possibly be confused with any other development in native America. Its perpetrators may be credited with a very significant accomplishment, in which direct contributions from Middle America were probably slight. COMPARISONS WITH HOPEWELL The possibility that the bulk of the late Southeastern artistic conceptions may have evolved indigenously from earlier horizons can be but barely touched upon here. In some ways it may prove to be the most fruitful ap- proach to the whole problem. It must be emphasized that the following notes only point to a field of inquiry which is well recognized but has always taken a back seat to the more alluring-and always elusive-Middle American explanation. For present purposes no distinction will be made between Adena traits and Hopewell. It will be understood by "Hopewell" that some of its content may have been present or incipient in the still earlier Adena. While few Hopewellian artifacts are strictly comparable to those of the late Southeast or "Southern Cult", most of the concepts and techniques which characterize the latter were already present in the former. To account for the differences between outward forms of artistic expression in the two horizons we have to hypothesize considerable metamorphosis for which there is little direct evidence on hand. That this is not at all improbable, however, is shown by accumulating evidence of gradual evolution in ceramic styles from Hopewell and even earlier cultures on into Early and Late Middle Mississippi (Temple Mound I and II). 60 In this connection it is important to note that Vaillant, 1932, pp. 18-20, concluded that certain ceramic traits of the Mississippi valley area provide a closer agreement with the early "Q complex" of Central America than with the later cultures of Mexico proper. However, there is no evidence of a continuity of "Q" elements along the gulf coast to Louisiana such as Vaillant hypothesized, and they appear to be substantially later in the western Mississippi valley than in Mexico or to the south. Better control over dating in the eastern United States might eventually reconcile this difference. An interesting sidelight concerns the notorious eccentric flints of north- east Oklahoma, which have been compared to eccentrics of the Maya in Honduras and Guate- mala. Not all the Oklahoma specimens are to be regarded as frauds, and some have evidently been found under trustworthy conditions at the Spiro Mound site. For a summary see Ellis, 1940, pp. 121-127.</page><page sequence="22">504 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 47, 1945 In Hopewellian times there was already an excellent development of stone carving and polishing, mainly in the form of monitor pipes with bowls carved into beautifully realistic birds and animals. It might be supposed that a continuation of this technique eventually led to the sculpturing of pipes in human and zoomorphic forms such as those found in the lower Mississippi valley and at Spiro Mound. This would be possible if the platform idea were dropped from the pipe while the sculptured figure was enlarged. Likewise, the same techniques of cold-hammering, cutting, and embossing of copper, so well developed in Hopewellian times, probably continued into the later cult horizon. Shetrone, for example, when comparing copper work in the Ohio Hopewell sites, usually includes some reference to the Etowah plates. The two complexes are on the whole quite distinct, Hopewellian work being preoccupied with stylizations of the cross, swastika, curved "plumes", and complex curvilinear patterns such as "serpent heads" with tongues. Nevertheless, it is extremely pertinent that large birds ("eagles") and human heads are sometimes depicted in left profile in the Hopewellian copper plates."e Thick, flat axes of copper, nearly rectangular or taperipg toward the pole, with either straight bits or flaring, convex ("spatulate") bits, are so nearly alike in both Hopewellian and Middle Mississippi times that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them. The use of copper with earspools is also con- tinuous, but evidently with changes from bi-cymbal forms of sheet copper to spools of stone, wood, shell, and pottery with thin copper covering. Mica cutouts also characterize Hopewellian art, but are not known to continue into the Mississippian horizon. They are of interest here in that, along with various conventional pendants, scrolls, etc., some cutouts represent a full-length human figure, a human head in left profile, a hand with long slender fingers, an eagle's (?) foot with curved talons, crouching animals, and even a serpent with plumes or horns sweeping back from its head.62 A representation of a horned monster with rattlesnake tail has been found carved in stone at the Turner Group.63 The bodies of this and a similar carving are covered with bands of finely cross-hatched lines. Still other Hopewellian artifacts which reflect their artistic sense are the beautifully incised bones (usually human limb or skull bone) and stone e1 In the Peabody Museum of Harvard University there is a copper breast-plate from the Harness Mound Group near Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. This is cut out to resemble an eagle (?) head in left profile, with open beak and tongue; the eye, a long streamer running down from the eye, and the beak are outlined with rows of tiny dents. Shetrone, 1936, figs. 71-72, illustrates whole "eagles" cut out and embossed in copper, ranging from realistic to conventional forms. On p. 395 he states that "Eagles incised on the sides of a number of Moundville vessels bear a close resemblance to eagles cut in sheet copper from the Hopewell Mound in Ross County, Ohio." Shetrone, 1927, fig. 138, shows a human head realistically wrought in left profile. 62 Willoughby, 1922, figs. 30-31, pl. 15; Shetrone, 1936, fig. 62; Shetrone, 1927, figs. 139-146. * Willoughby, 1922, figs. 32-33, pl. 19.</page><page sequence="23">xRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 505 "marbles". The designs on these objects are done in complex curvilinear patterns in which a highly perfected bilateral symmetry is achieved. Some of these seem to be floral but others are highly conventionalized animals, birds or wipgs.4 On at least one of these bones there is clearly an attempt to depict a near-human creature with a pair of large wings and a set of deer antlers.65 A close connection between man, deer, and bird, as we have seen, is one of the ritualistic concepts appearing on Southeastern gorgets. A similar conception might underlie the headdress of copper-covered wooden antlers found by Moorehead on a burial in the Hopewell group.66 A wooden mask with antlers, also once copper-covered, is illustrated by Kelemen67 from the Spiro Mound in eastern Oklahoma. Such instances at least point toward a connection in ritualistic background between Hope- wellian and the late Southeast. Conch shells were in fairly common use in Hopewellian times, being trimmed into receptacles by removing the columnellae. These occur in graves, usually near the head.68 Conch shell was also used for a variety of beads, small disks, and gorgets, but neither these objects nor the receptacles seem to have been decorated. Evidently attention shifted from bone to shell as a decorative medium in later times. The use of pearl beads continued from Hopewell times into such cultures as those represented at Etowah and Spiro. Elaborately chipped and presumably ceremonial artifacts in the Southern Cult complex reflect a virtuosity in chipping technique which also has a counterpart in the Hopewellian horizon. In the latter, very large spear (?) points and blades were beautifully chipped from flint and obsidian far beyond utilitarian requirements. Moreover, as in the case of many polished stone artifacts, the innovations in form which appear in connection with the cult material in the Temple Mound II horizon cannot be satisfactorily traced to any known source outside the eastern states. In summary, most of the basic techniques which underlie the Southern Cult artifacts were already well developed in Burial Mound times, as seen in the wonderful Hopewellian work. These techniques include the cold hammer- ing, cutting, embossing, and incising of copper; working of conch shell; and well-developed chipping and polished-stone industries with non-utilitarian elaboration of forms. The trade routes by which copper and conch shell were obtained had also been established in the earlier period, but for some reason the use of mica, obsidian, and silver seems to have been abandoned. It is also possible that a negative-painting technique had been established in the eastern states in connection with Hopewellian culture.69 64 Idem, pl. 2, figs. 23-24; Shetrone, 1927, figs. 136, 147-149; Shetrone, 1936, fig. 77. 16 Peet, 1903, fig. on p. 304. 1" Illustrated in Shetrone, 1936, fig. 121. 67 Kelemen, 1943, pl. 271a.

In this interesting discussion it is brought out that.</page><page sequence="24">506 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 Ceremonial objects and motifs already developed in Hopewell times include cut-outs of human heads, "eagle" heads, and "eagle" claws in left profile; stylizations of the cross and swastika; ritualistic use of conch-shell receptacles; carvings and cut-outs of horned water-monsters and rattlesnakes; curved plume-like objects of sheet copper; copper celts with straight and convex, flaring bits; general use of earspools; conceptions of a great and powerful bird, and of a human form equipped with large wings and deer antlers. A practice of taking trophy heads is also evident in the burial of humanl heads in Hope- wellian mounds. Hopewellian copper work reveals a strong sense of bilateral and quadrilat- eral symmetry. Bisymmetry occurs when two "eagle" heads or scroll motifs are duplicated back-to-back in the cut-outs. Quadration occurs in various floral,(?) motifs and representations of the square, cross, and swastika. This sense of perfection in balance and symmetry is carried to the extreme in the complex patterns incised on bone. The same culture also produced a simple and effective naturalism in some of the exquisite monitor pipes. The Southern Cult depictions do not reveal the Hopewellian love for abstract stylizations, but a similar tendency toward order and balance in bilateral and quadrilateral "mirror symmetry" is quite evident. Thus the so- called "fighting warriors" or "fighting eagle men" seen on Tennessee-Cumber- land and Etowah gorgets are as much a study of mirror symmetry for aesthetic effect as they are of ritualistic combat. Two facing birds provide another example. It is also evident that the cult figures present an odd mixture of near realism and conventionalization. On the one hand, human figures with their ceremonial paraphernalia such as batons, chipped blades, headdresses, trophy heads, etc., are often drawn with such accuracy that one instantly identifies them; yet at the same time the postures and wings are drawn conventionally. Again, serpents, birds, spiders, deer heads, and the like are portrayed in conventional manner, with certain identifying features such as rattles, crests, and the Falconidae eyemarking evidently drawn from nature. Where skulls, bones, hands, crosses, and the like are found, they are strongly conventional- ized. Many of the associations represented are no doubt cosmogonic and magical, and we will probably never know their original meanings, yet the since textile fragments from Etowah and Spiro were decorated in a lost-color technique, and those from the Hopewellian Seip Mound suggest a similar method, and moreover, incised decoration on some Hopewell pottery creates negative designs, ". .. negative painting may have been present in, or in some way connected with, Hopewellian culture." This gives rise to another interesting and important consideration in connection with the Southern Cult artistic work: might not a transfer from perishable to durable media account, at least in part, for the sudden appearance of the fully developed and skillfully controlled art in copper and shell which characterizes this ceremonial complex? More attention to this aspect of the problem might bear very fruitful results.</page><page sequence="25">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 507 sureness of the work indicates that the artists were very familiar with the subject matter. Speaking broadly, the greatest shift in emphasis from Hopewellian art to that of the Southern Cult lies in the far greater interest shown by the latter in the human figure. Whether this was due to some outside influence, or canme about internally is not clear at present. On the other hand, interest in large birds, closely associated with the human element in the Southern Cult, must have been of considerably greater antiquity in the eastern states. An example may be seen in the carving of a bird on a stone vessel from Poverty Point in northeastern Louisiana, found in a non-ceramic culture which may be related to the Tchefuncte complex.6ea HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The most obvious objection to the suggestion that the De Luna expedition may have provided the impetus to the spread of a ceremonial cult is that no Mexican or European objects have been found in proved association with the Southern Cult where it reached its earliest and richest development. The same may be said of the De Soto explorations. It has often been observed that, had such comparatively wealthy and sophisticated centers as Moundville and Etowah been flourishing in the middle 16th century, word of them would likely have reached De Soto, and he would probably have attempted to visit them. A similar argument may be applied to Spiro, for both Coronado and De Soto may have approached near enough to have heard of it from their guides. There remains a remote possibility that the cult centers were not established until about 1600 or after. On the other hand, there is much to indicate that they reached their culmination well before 1540. Waring and Holder have presented a convincing outline of chronological relations in the cultures which contain the ceremonial complex from the lower Mississippi valley eastward to the Atlantic seaboard of Georgia: Waring has also prepared a supplementary note on the chronological position of the cult in Georgia.70 Briefly, in Georgia the ceremonial complex occurs in three sub- divisions of the latest archaeological horizon; that is, they are "Middle Mississippi" or affected by "Middle Mississippi" and include shell temper in the pottery. The three periods are: (1) Macon, in which "a raised dais in the shape of an eagle with a Forked Eye plainly puddled in the baked clay" was found at the rear of a ceremonial earth lodge, opposite the tunnel entranceway; (2) the time represented by Etowah Mound C and the basal mound at the Hollywood site; and (3) the Lamar period, during which contacts with 6a Clarence H. Webb, 1944, fig. 31-1. 70 Antonio J. Waring, Jr., The De Luna Expedition and Southeastern Ceremonial, submitted to "Facts and Comments", American Antiquity.</page><page sequence="26">508 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 Europeans began. The Macon discovery "shows the complex in an early and formative stage and also points unmistakably to a Mississippian origin of the ceremonial" because of the influx of other Mississippian material into the Macon area at this time. The Macon site remains the only one known, so far, that shows a formative stage of the specific cult idea regarding the eagle with the forked eye. The Etowah Mound C-Hollywood stage shows the cult in full bloom, the "period of greatest elaboration". In the Lamar stage, cult elements are scarce and show "neither the elaboration nor stylistic assurance seen in the preceding period, and they appear only on a small range of cere- monial objects" (shell gorgets with rattlesnake and cross motifs, human-head -.ffigy pipes, and negative-painted bottles). Lamar was followed in Georgia by the period known as Ocmulgee Fields, which is dated by English trade materials falling into the period 1690 to 1715. Lamar itself has been cross-dated with the period of Spanish attempts to establish missions along the Georgia coast between 1560 and 1670. It is strongly indicated, then, that the ceremonial complex was in a state of full development at Etowah before the De Soto and De Luna expeditions. Waring and Holder also cite some evidence that De Soto's men observed items already in use which may have had connection with this cult. The Koger's Island stage in northern Alabama, with which the Moundville ceremonial material may be correlated, seems to overlap the Macon and Etowah periods. Several of the elaborated ceremonial elements are common to Moundville and Etowah. At least some of the Tennessee cult material also falls in this period. Ford and Willey have stated that Moundville may first have been settled at about 1400, that is, at the beginning of their Temple Mound I stage, but the efflorescence of the ceremonial complex occurred there somewhat later.71 They also believe that the Coles Creek period extended from about 1400 to 1550 in the lower Mississippi valley, but was about over when De Soto reached the Mississippi. Recent studies on the Plaquemine culture, however, indicate that its development out of Coles Creek may have taken place by De Soto's time.71 In the lower valley, elements of the ceremonial complex have been found only in the Natchez period which succeeded Plaquemine. Possibly this means that the cult was diffusing in that direction after it was fully developed farther inland. Turning to the Spiro culture, recent researches73 west of the Mississippi 71 Ford and Willey, 1941, p. 350. This position of Moundville is, however, open to question. James B. Griffin has informed me that "Moundville is an extraordinarily homogeneous site, much more so than Etowah, and that it can hardly belong in what was called the Temple Mound I and in the period of the cult also." 72 Correspondence with George I. Quimby, Jr. 7 Alex D. Krieger, Chronological Relationships between Southwest and Southeast, to be pub- lished, and Archaeological Horizons in the Caddo Area, to be published.</page><page sequence="27">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 509 have shown that the Spiro Focus was at least partly contemporaneous with Upper Republican in the central Plains. Wede174 has presented considerable evidence that Upper Republican had in the main disappeared before 1500, and that by Coronado's time the "kingdom of Harahey", probably referable to early Pawnee peoples, had become established in eastern Nebraska. Moreover, Spiro almost certainly belongs to the earlier of two great blocks of cultural development in the "Caddo area". The later of these, the Fulton Aspect, includes several foci which correlate with St. Francis, Plaquemine, and Natchez on the one hand, and with protohistoric Pawnee and the "Quivira" of Coronado on the other. Thus certain evidence on the western side points to the Spiro cult material having been developed before 1500. Vessels which apparently belong to the Coles Creek period have been found intrusively at Spiro, tending to bear out this chronological position. Though shell tempering may have lagged in the time of its distribution west of the Mississippi, it is notable that Spiro Focus is without such temper, though it appears in a succeeding complex in this area. Another interesting tie-up is afforded by intrusive Puebloan sherds in Plains cultures. Thus, Rio Grande Glaze sherds datable at about 1525-1650 have been found in association with the "Quivira" complex in central Kansas.75 This culture can be shown to have been contemporaneous with the Henrietta Focus in north-central Texas. The latter reveals no glaze intrusions but there are a few instances of Chupadero Black-on-White.76 Material from the Henrietta Focus has been found stratigraphically superimposed on the Sanders Focus component at the T. M. Sanders site in Lamar County, north- east Texas. This Sanders material includes engraved shells and gorgets similar to those of the cult at Spiro, and there are intrusions of Sanders Focus pottery types at Spiro. Thus Spiro, Sanders, and Upper Republican give evidence of having existed more or less contemporaneously in a general horizon preceding that of Henrietta, Quivira, and Pawnee. The projected dateline which roughly divides these horizons is shown by Puebloan sherds to have been close to 1500. Farther east, sherds of St. Francis types have been found intrusively in foci of the Fulton Aspect in northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas, showing that St. Francis was somewhat later than Spiro; how much later, it is hard to say. It is thus notable that chronological factors involving the Southern Cult shape up in remarkably similar fashion in the western and eastern portions of the Southeastern region. Moreover, they are reached by independent methods of reckoning. It is evident that we can look to a time perhaps a century earlier than the time of the Spanish entradas for the inspiration of the Southern Cult. The detailed evidence for this view must still be presented in the various parts of the Southeast, but it should be of general interest that there is little, if any, "4 Wedel, 1940, pp. 328-334. 76 Wedel, 1942, pp. 6, 9. 76 See note 73.</page><page sequence="28">510 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 proof on hand that the cult must be relegated entirely to a post-1540 period. If a Middle American origin or influence on the cult can be objectively demonstrated (contrary to the argument presented here), a rough temporal agreement with the century preceding the Conquest is apparent. The 15th century was a time of great unrest and disruption in southern Mexico and the Yucatan peninsula. Aztecan conquests and terrorism on the one side, and civil wars, droughts, hurricanes, and abandonment of cities on the other, make it quite unnecessary to settle on the Spanish conquest as a stimulus to the migration of peoples out of southern Mexico. CONCLUSIONS It has been questioned whether the late Southeastern artifacts of an evidently ceremonial nature demonstrate the general distribution of a single religious movement. In the first objective analysis of this material, Waring and Holder have set forth the hypothesis that a single ceremonial core- complex spread rapidly over the Southeast. They further suggest that in the course of this spread the original core was subjected to local modification according to economic status and previous social and religious organization of the receivers. The writer has suggested the alternative that areal and temporal differentials in the occurrence of ceremonial elements may indicate the development of a series of interrelated religious concepts; that these concepts come to life, as it were, with the ability of the Southeastern Indians to record them objectively on durable media. No particular conclusions are reached on this matter, it being urged that more study be directed toward this highly intriguing problem by specialists from different points of view. It has also been questioned that the religious phenomenon responsible for these specimens was messianic in nature. Not only do the greatest centers fail to reflect decimation through Caucasian inroads, but many of the figures themselves lend reason to the belief that their basis lay in the yowers of certain nature spirits and their relationships with man, rather than in reaction to death and cultural decline. In the matter of Middle American influence, there is no particular necessity to postulate any direct contact to account for such depictions as large and powerful birds and anthropomorphizations thereof, horned and winged rattle- snakes, winged and antlered men or beings, and such symbolizations as the hand, eye, trophy heads, and variations of the cross and four-quarters idea. Furthermore, many of the associated artifact types, such as stone images, circular stone palettes, effigy pipes, repousse copper plates, monolithic axes, and engraved shells and gorgets are either exclusively Southeastern or of questionable affiliation with other regions. It has also been shown that many, if not most, of the concepts and techniques which underlie the Southern Cult artifacts were already known in Burial Mound II times in Hopewellian</page><page sequence="29">KRIEGER] SUPPOSED MEXICAN INFLUENCE ON A PREHISTORIC "CULT" 511 material. This seems especially significant to one working in Texas, for it is often speculated that evidence of diffusion of ceremonial elements from Mexico will be found in this state, while actually none is yet forthcoming. This, of course, does not preclude the possibility of some movement having taken place across Texas which was too rapid to have left traces, or of having taken place by some other route. This is by no means a denial of Middle American influence on the cultures of the eastern states. It is entirely possible that from time to time, and perhaps by different routes and means, elements from the south reached the eastern area and were modified to suit the particular needs and tastes of the receivers. One cannot deny that with the spread of agriculture and pottery- making into the eastern states, various ritualistic and artistic ideas must have accompanied them. The principle of building temple mounds may well have been introduced from Mexico. It is simply that, where the main body of ceremonial objects grouped under the term "Southern Cult" is concerned, the writer sees little specific resemblance in subject matter and stylistic treatment with the known cultures of Mexico proper. We continually read of "strong Mexican re- semblances", that "the Mexican origin of this material has been recognized", and so on. If such statements are to be accepted, their value will have to be demonstrated on a much more objective basis than has so far been offered. In freedom of line and naturalistic proportioning of the human figure, one may see more reasonable counterparts to the Southeastern art in some late Maya frescoes, such as at Chichen Itza, than in styles of the Mexican High- lands and coast. Certain earlier Maya reliefs, such as at Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan, provide even greater resemblance in control of line and naturalism in the human figure, but are presumably too far removed in time from the Southeastern work to provide historical connections. Of the elements included in the cult complex by Waring and Holder, the following appear to approach most closely to depictions found in Mexico and the Maya region: skull and bone symbols, found in by far the greatest fre- quency at Moundville; long-nosed masks; and the special Spiro elements which include dual human figures of slightly different postures and paraphernalia, intertwined serpent bodies differently decorated, and one case of what seems to be the use of forked speech symbols (not speech scrolls) combined with a forked pole which might represent a maize stalk. It does not follow from these few similarities that the main body of artifacts and ritualistic concepts seen in the Southern Cult material owes its origin to direct influence from Middle America. The relationships between the elements which may be foreign, and those which probably are not, depend upon further careful analyses of the whole Southern Cult problem, and especially upon more specific association of cult elements in space and time throughout the Southeast. As Linton has pointed out in correspondence, much depends upon the relative time of</page><page sequence="30">512 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 47, 1945 appearance of cult elements in the eastern states; that is, do they all appear together suddenly within a narrow time horizon, or do some appear before others even though the total time represented is short? By a "short" time, do we mean in this case a dozen years or a hundred? We have shown that many of the techniques, artistic concepts, and ritualistic associations which underlie the Southern Cult material were already well developed in Hopewellian times. The degree of dependency of Hopewell on Middle America is a matter which has not been attempted here. It is my present belief that the late cult owes considerably more to Hopewell than it does to any specific late influence from Middle America, yet there are also a number of new traits which seem characteristic of the Southern Cult alone. The Puebloan Southwest should not be overlooked as another possible source of ceremonial influence. In all of this, there is little purpose in underrating the ability of Southeastern Indians to produce an elaborate and complex religious movement of their own, with only moderate help from the south or any other direction. Meanwhile, postulation of "warrior cults" or the like, transferred in some manner from the southern civilizations to the Southern states and there providing the germs of another religious cult, oversimplifies the entire matter. It by-passes the knotty problems of culture process and selection, with con- sequent readaptation of elements to new uses and new associations; it fails to account for the general absence of clear Middle American artifact types; it perpetuates the illusion that other American cultures were unable to produce anything of note without direct help from the great civilizations to the south. Only more study, and especially more critical examination, will eventually produce the most reasonable answers. I do not claim to have found any of the answers in the present paper; these are questions and considerations only.77 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ANTHROPOLOGY DEPARTMENT 77 This paper had been completed before I read the study by Bennett (Bennett, 1944). Where Bennett stresses the point of economic and structural development in Southeastern cul- tures before they were sociologically ready for the acceptance of Middle American traits, I agree entirely. On the other hand, I cannot share his belief in the great strength of a very late thrust of influence from Middle America in his Period IV. It is the religious cult itself which provides the basis for his "push" of influence from the south; without it, there would be no more influence apparent than in the Hopewellian period. In several respects the treatment and terminology are veWy uncritical. Thus, to use without explanation such phrases as "bird-serpent-jaguar" com- posites, "deity face-painting", "ceremonial atlatls", "pri6sts and warriors with feather cloaks" (the figures with two large wings ?), "warriors locked in ceremonial combat", "ceremonial pyramidal mound-warrior-priest complex", seems to me to assume analogies with Mexican traits which are highly questionable. Can anyone be sure that the winged figures of the Southeast represent warriors or priests?

Bennett refers to late Period IV ceremonial elements as "easily identifiable Middle American (Mexican) traits" and suggests that the religious cult came from somewhere in the Vera Cruz-southern Mexico area. If this is supportable, one could wish for the original data. Likewise, if it is true that "These traits also appear first in the extreme southern portion of the Southeast, which strengthens the case for diffusion from Middle America", it is highly desirable that archaeological evidence be presented to show that the southernmost sites with the cult are earlier than those farther inland. And from Bennett's own point of view, he would not have had as much trouble reconciling the differences in dating between the Southeast and Middle America had he not insisted on a post-1540 age for the cult.</page><page sequence="32">514 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 47, 1945 MEADE, JOAQUfN 1942 La Huasteca.
