'What surmounts the reach / Of human sense, I shall delineate so, / By likening spiritual to corporeal forms', says the angel Raphael in John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost. Although this is a poem about the Fall of Man, most of the agents and events that figure in its narrative are beyond the realm of human experience. Angels narrate the drama and recount the angelic war in heaven that precedes the creation itself: Raphael, the 'heavenly guest, ethereal messenger', sits down with Adam to describe creation; Michael, having driven the sinful pair from © The Author 2011.

Anthropomorphic protagonists and a dramatic story are part of the process of accommodating divine realities to the limited comprehension of human beings. Angels themselves have been a vital part of the same process of making the spiritual accessible, as Joad Raymond explains in his intriguing study of Milton, angels, and seventeenth-century ere ativity. Angels exist to praise God, carry his messages, bear wit ness, and act as ministering spirits, but, as Raymond observes, Milton's angels have a much more complete life than this: they 'sing, watch, play games and exercise, eat, sleep, make love, bear messages, interpret, bear witness, move the universe, and, above all, talk. They make mistakes... They are agents with freewill, responsibility, and leisure time' (p. 272). These sentient, free, material angels have created numerous problems for the tidy-minded readers of Milton's great poem over the years. Their very status is troubling: what kind of spir itual being needs to don armour and fight with swords and fire arms? In fact these angels are material beings but they are not embodied, rather their matter has its 'own' 'proper' shape. Milton's angels were made and fell before the creation; they fell of their own free will: but if the fallen angels had acted freely, could the remaining angels fall in future? And where was the hand of God in all this? Raymond asserts that one reso lution of such anxieties has been for commentators to draw a sharp distinction between Milton's 'argument' and 'imagination', between 'doctrine' and 'story', and to dock the poet marks for doctrinal defects while awarding him stars for the poetical power and purpose of the angels who bestride his epic. Some would even argue that the theology deadened the poetry. Raymond, however, will have none of this. He wants to integrate 'argument' and 'imagination' by showing that they are mutually reinforcing. And key to this integration are the principles of 'accommodation' and poetic 'inspiration'. The first brings divine truths down to the human level and the second authorizes the 'poet-prophet' to re-imagine those divine truths. For Milton—claims Raymond— the creative process resembles 'accommodation' and poetic rep resentation can extend what is known theologically. Raymond vindicates these claims and his reintegrative ap proach on two broad fronts, by analysing the understanding of angels in early modern English culture and by close scrutiny of Paradise Paradise Lost and other of Milton's writings. The first half of the book is given over to an examination of how angels were</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 398 comprehended by Milton's contemporaries and this is both a necessary preliminary to Raymond's later argument and an en thralling cultural archaeology in its own right. Raymond is too canny to look for a single unified theory of angels. Systematic, free-standing expositions of the doctrine of angels, such as the Baptist Henry Lawrence's Of our Communion and War re with Angels Angels (1646), are apparently rare; but while there are few 'angelologies' as such, there are numerous scriptural commen taries that treat the subject. Much is to be gleaned from Aquinas, Luther, and Calvin, from the Westminster Assembly's Annotations,Annotations, Andrew Willet's Hexapla in Genesin (1605), or more obscure works such as the Devon minister George Hughes's An Analytical Exposition of the Whole First Book of Moses Moses (1672). Thus the common core of the understanding of angels can be established, but this literature permits a great deal of latitude for speculation and elaboration in those areas that might be termed angelic adiaphora. Once Raymond opens the discussion up to the mystics, prophets, and others who had 'con versed with angels' the subject takes flight. The mid-century visionary John Pordage ate manna with angels and could tell the bad from the good angel by their odours. His son, Samuel, published a long epic based in part upon these visions in 1661, just six years before Paradise Lost appeared. Some of these in dividuals were eccentric, but the depth of material that Raymond provides amply supports his contention that angels were a force in seventeenth-century Protestant culture. True, they were no longer visually present in churches, but they were imaginatively available, and Raymond makes a persuasive case that ways of writing about angels were proliferating rather than dwindling as the century progressed: a point neatly hammered home by the example of Dryden's rewriting of Paradise Lost. The second half of the book addresses Milton. There are close readings—much is made, for example, of Abdiel's speech at the end of Book V which, to Raymond's mind, suggests an angelic 'untruth' that must in turn be a clue from Milton about his views on poetic representation, truth, falsehood, and instruction. There are learned and discursive chapters that relate Milton's angels to themes such as nationhood or guardian angels or to the natural philosophy and optics of the seventeenth century. The alleged conclusion is almost a separate essay about the dissoci ation of sensibilities in seventeenth-century literature and the changing interpretative models of literary scholars.
