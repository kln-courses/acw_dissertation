<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SERMON AS A METHOD OF TEACHING R. LOFTON HUDSON Peabody Graduate School Millions of people assemble every week to hear sermons. As long as this is true it cannot be doubted that preaching is an im- portant part of modern education, particularly adult education. It seems rather obvious, too, that the sermon is a method of teaching. The minister may prefer to think of it in relation to the worship program as a whole and rather resent the prosaic suggestion that he is merely a teacher of a lesson. Be that as it may, when the minister stands up to preach he is primarily a teacher. He belongs to a tradition which extends at least back to the prophets of Israel; and though it forecasts no millennium of results, it could hardly be said to be on the wane. Leaders in religious education avail them- selves of many novel devices and techniques in presenting their messages but the one invariable method is the sermon. Fathered by the oration and sheltered in the household of the "literature of thought" it has tended, like the essay, and because of its very nature, to remain relatively static. Nevertheless, though its form and content have varied but slightly through the centuries, the sermon has been received by rich and poor, educated and illiterate, bond and free. A congregation has been likened to a group of jugs set side by side and uncorked. The sermon is an attempt to fill them by splash- ing a bucket of water in their direction. That is not a very profound figure but it does epitomize the difficulty of assaying to fit the sermon method and material to the diverse needs and susceptibilities of the people. There sit before the preacher the saint and the sinner, the tempter and the tempted, the conservative and liberal, the humble and the defiant, the senile and the adolescent, the capitalist and the laborer-"the good Lord made them all." One needs comfort and encouragement while another must be shaken out of his lethargy and complacency. One lay awake last night wondering if there is a God and if He has any purposes for each puny life; while sitting beside him is a calloused soul who winks at all spiritual exercises and hardly apprehends why he has come to church. Then there are those who want their sermons a la mode with literary allusions and learned quotations; and beside them sit virile "unwashed" people who want the gospel clothed in plain Anglo-Saxon garb with an additional touch of crudity. If this is not an exaggeration of the problem facing the preacher, one must admit that he faces a para- 12803</page><page sequence="2">SERMON A METHOD OF TEACHING mount task with but a worn (if not out-worn) tool, the sermon. From the standpoint of evolution the sermon should have become anathema along with the "lecture method" in education. One should not overlook the fact, however, that the lecture method has not be- come extinct and even progressives continue to recognize it as one of the indispensable ways of educating. In religious education, simi- larly, it is not necessarily the best way to impart certain kinds of religious knowledge, and certainly not an exclusive method, but no one has found an entirely satisfactory substitute. Among both secu- lar and religious educational theorists the principal objection urged against the lecture method is that it does not allow sufficient place to the importance of activity in learning. Of course, learning never takes place except where there is activity. But it would be a carica- ture of educational psychology to assume for a moment that this activity must be physical or bodily activity. Skills are learned by physical activity, but such is obviously not the case with apprecia- tions, reasoning, etc. Though there is a touch of anthropomorphism in speaking of "manipulating thoughts," one must necessarily think of learning as involving activity in which the past experiences, con- cepts, images, etc. are rearranged in the mind, for want of a better word. This is the psychic activity on which the lecture and the sermon rely. The lecture has its advantages. A. D. Mueller, professor of educa- tion at the University of Tennessee, has pointed them out: 1. The first and foremost use of the lecture is to provide informa- tion not already known and not easily available to the group. 2. The lecture economizes time. 3. The lecture provides a means for balancing perspective. 4. The lecture makes possible explanation and interpretation of data leading to the development and defense of a given view- point or course of action. 5. The lecture arouses interest and enthusiasm and gives inspiration. 6. The lecture serves as a means to challenge thinking.' There is no attempt here to defend any one method in education. Rather, it seems wise to remember that for some phases of teaching there is no better method than the lecture, and that it still avails as an important aspect of modern education. The same can be said for religious education, with particular application to the sermon. In all educational work the method must be determined by the objective. What, then, is the objective of a sermon? A famous definition of 1A. D. Mueller, Principles and Methods in Adult Education, p. 254. 281</page><page sequence="3">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION a sermon describes it as "an oral address to the popular mind, upon religious truth contained in the Scripture, and elaborately treated with a view to persuasion."2 One might find a dozen substitutes for the word "elaborately," but the word "persuasion" is well chosen. Probably more sermons are preached to persuade men and women than for all other reasons combined. The sermon attempts to per- suade men to follow a way of life, to accept a dogma, to make a decision, or to aspire after certain heights of moral and spiritual idealism. If the apostle Paul may be used as an example, he re- marked of his own attitude that "knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men" (2 Cor. 5:11 RV). This persuasion may be direct as in exhortations of various kinds; or indirect, by use of de- scription, praise, condemnation, illustration, and the like. We shall not concern ourselves here with the ultimate objectives of religious education. Instead, let us survey the immediate aims of sermons in terms of types of learning. Some sermons have as their aim the remembering of certain material. There are few of these, but an example would be a sermon on "How to Be Saved?" by a holiness group which would list formal steps such as repentance, belief, confession, baptism, and sanctification. In this case there would be the element of rote learning. These five steps must be learned in the order given as a prerequisite to the experience of religion. An- other type of learning, trial and error, figures little in preaching inasmuch as the sermon must necessarily conserve time by prescribing the thought content. A third type, associative, plays a part in every sermon. This association may be emotional or logical. In the case of the former, new facts, ideas, or experiences are related to those deeply embedded in the mind. This may be illustrated by the tra- ditional evangelists' appeal to the sentimentality related to "the dear little mother back yonder on her knees, etc." The logical as- sociation consists of showing that one thing is the cause of another, is a part of a larger whole, or is like another. For example, the work of the church is usually considered to be a part of the kingdom of God, whereas the particular sin attacked must be related to the kingdom of evil. The effective preacher relates his new knowledge, desirable attitudes, and proposed experiences to such factors in the hearers experience as will make them meaningful. A similar type of learning is conditioning. This is the principal kind of learning in- volved in church attendance, both in worship and in listening to the sermon. A famous example of the conditioning of an audience is to be found in Massillon's sermon on "The Small Number of the 2Quoted in Andrew W. Blackwood, Preaching From the Bible, p. 35. 282 [March</page><page sequence="4">SERMON A METHOD OF TEACHING Elect" preached before Louis XIV's dissolute court. Horror and dismay caused the guilty worldlings to cry out in alarm as his ter- rible eloquence opened to them a vision of the judgment for which their own sins had been amply preparing them. The "Grand Monarch" remarked to Massillon that when he heard other preachers he had been highly pleased but when he heard him, he went away displeased with himself, for he saw his own character. A fifth type of learning has to do with signs. The words and visible symbols used in religion must be explained, distinguished, and magnified. The sermon often has this as an immediate aim. A last type of learning is insight. This is by no means the least of the functions of a sermon. In Luther's famous sermon, "The Method and Fruits of Justification," he explains that "justification pertains to man, and not to works," thereby setting forth the idea that it is not works that determines man's salvation but God's mercy. This is a type of insight into the meaning of a doctrine. Insight into the problem of evil may be gained by hearing a sermon on the providence of God. Thus we see that in the hearing of a sermon we have essentially the same types of learning found in other educational procedures.3 Looked at from the standpoint of educational outcomes the sermon aims principally at the matter of attitudes and appreciations and secondarily at knowledge. This means then that the technique used must be mainly what has been called the "appreciation technique," that is, to help the pupil develop such tastes, interests and attitudes as will promote the most complete and effective life. Religions, all of them, have their criteria for measuring the effectiveness of a life. Also they have some insight into the means of reaching the pre- scribed end. Generally, the sermon, as one of the means, aims at (1) setting forth the ideals of the particular religion, (2) illustrating the worth and practicableness of the ideals, (3) and stimulating the active participation in the ideal life. To attain these objectives the preacher, like the teacher, must be both artist and artisan. As artist he brings that intangible touch of personality into his work, which defies analysis. Like genius, it can be observed and admired but never completely defined. His art is nearest the art of the stage, with the preacher playing the role of both playwright and actor. The poet or the painter may leave his art behind, but the art of the preacher dies with the artist. Therefore all written sermons are but the shadow of a lost reality. Again, great preaching like all great arts must awaken the imagina- tion and help man "to see life steadily and see it whole." If it 'The outline of types of learning follows Coleman R. Griffith, Psychology Applied to Teaching and Learning, (Farrar &amp; Rinehart, Inc., 1939), pp. 160-175. 283 1943]</page><page sequence="5">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION fails in this, it becomes the jargon of theological or university lecture rooms, or of scholarly books, put together in an unimaginative manner. The language of the preacher like that of the novelist, the dramatist, the autobiographer, and usually the poet, is what Wordsworth called "the language really used by men." He must throw over it "a certain colouring of the imagination" but this is always to be guided by his ultimate criterion that the hearer be affected. The preacher, like the teacher, must stay close to what is called the "experience level." His approach, his language, as well as the content of his sermon must be based on the religious, social, political, and economic experiences of the congregation. It is this that makes the Bible of such paramount interest and value in the sermon. It is folk literature which reflects and records the universal problems, aspiration, conquests, and despairs of the soul. Other books serve similar purposes in other religions. In addition to the written traditions, the one other most common source material is the preacher's own religious experience and that of others with whom he is ac- quainted. The sermon is the product of the tradition and current religious experiences plus a fair degree of interpretation in the light of the environment. This last aspect, environment, might best be described as the orientation of the material. It should be noted that viewed as a whole, Christian sermons have been largely of the textual type. The text is a sentence or part of a sentence, usually from the Bible, which epitomizes, illustrates, or suggests a larger topic. If it is a well known passage, it serves the purpose of a peg on which to hang the thoughts. If not well known but highly imaginative, the text may become an excellent introduction by which the attention of the audience is captured. If the text is obscure, and many that were once well-known are now obscure, the result is that more time must be spent on elucidating the text and context. It may be pointed out, therefore, that when a text is an asset to the sermon it is so because it is closely related to the experience of the audience. The same principle applies to a topic or title. The content of the sermon, it should be pointed out further, is religion. This is one of the distinguishing marks of a sermon. The line of demarcation between a sermon and a lecture is not always clear, yet the material rather than the form or method of delivery seems to be a more nearly satisfactory criterion. One may hear an occasional sermon on a topic rather remotely related to the religious life, but both the layman and the clergy will be found contesting its place as a sermon. The material of sermons varies from age to age, depending on the emphasis, but the one invariable factor is the religious nature of the sermon subject. For example, during the [March 284</page><page sequence="6">SERMON A METHOD OF TEACHING Medieval period the homilies (kind of sermon) consisted largely of allegorical interpretations of the scripture which emphasized the place of the church, its life, duties, liturgies, and demands; whereas in the Reformation era more emphasis was placed on current sins, controversies over certain doctrines, and the literal interpretation of the Bible. Today, there is an increasing interest in sermons of a psychological nature, dealing with problems of mental health. But it would be easy for the historian to show that these are all related to and outgrowths of the same human problem-generally speaking, man's vital adjustment to what he considers to be the ultimates of life. Sermons vary in form even less than in content. It may be stated rather formally that they have almost always had an introduction, a main body, and a conclusion. Actually, though, this is no more true of the sermon than of the essay or the lecture. Since preach- ing has been done largely by men who have received a fair amount of formal literary training, the sermon has followed a set literary form more often than not. Early Christian preaching consisted of unpreten- tious talks or homilies without much logical order, and with little indi- cation of a previously prepared outline. In contrast to this stands the monotonous, extensive, ultra-logical outlined sermons of the scholastics, such as Thomas Aquinas. An example of how dry and dull they may become is the Parson's Tale of Chaucer-a desiccated harangue on repentance and the seven deadly sins. The tendency in the modern era is to give more attention to the psychological rather than the logical form. Dr. William L. Stidger of Boston University School of Theology has been particularly successful in popularizing this type of sermon. He takes a theme which may be illustrated by some text and a quotation from poetry, then develops the various aspects of it very much as a musician does in a symphony. He calls these "symphonic sermons." Other attempts at variety and originality have done little to change the traditional form of the sermon. The pulpit today is largely rid of the artificiality of numerous "points" or "heads," but the modern clamor for simplicity and brevity has done little more than make the form inconspicuous and natural. We still have an introduction of an average of about one-tenth of the entire sermon, a main part consisting of a few main ideas, and a conclusion somewhat shorter than the introduction. It should be noted in closing that the crux of the matter of effective preaching is the motivation furnished by the sermon. By motivation we mean the conditions that push or pull the individual in a given direction. On the biological level we refer to such drives as hunger, thirst, sex, etc. From the standpoint of teaching or preaching we 19431 285'</page><page sequence="7">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION must think in terms of "wishes," "desires," "emotional needs," "in- terests," or "wants." These words have been used to designate both the innate and acquired motives which have been found to be almost universal; and at least are dominant in our civilization. One may prefer the five interests (health, sociability, knowledge, beauty, and righteousness) of Albion W. Small,4 the five wants (food, comfort, mate, power, approbation) of Daniel Starch5 and others, or the more penetrating wishes (new experience, security, response, and recogni- tion) of W. I. Thomas.6 No two psychologists or sociologists would agree entirely on any one of these classifications, but all must agree that if the preacher is to be effective he must attempt to satisfy some religious needs of the hearer. We may learn from the advertisers here. The modern advertiser first takes inventory of the needs, real and artificial, of his clients, then determines his product and sales appeal on the basis of these needs. One need not be cynical about this approach to religion. Every religion proposes to satisfy the needs of its devotees, and a realistic interpretation of most re- ligions requires that we account for the existence of their doctrine and rituals on the basis of the needs of the people. We can only sell or teach that which someone wishes to buy or learn. It is possible that much poor preaching has been due to the fact that many have tried to preach about something that had only a marginal appeal. There was no "readiness" because the material did not deal with fundamental human needs. For example, few people would be interested in the distinction between such abstract terms as "sentiment" and "attitude," but all except a few cynical intellectuals would be intensely interested in a discussion of the possibility of a happy life hereafter. Such a discussion would be directed toward what Thomas calls the wish for security. Some will no doubt affirm that there are things which people need to know that they do not wish to know. This may be so. But it will be a safe guess that unless there is some active or latent motive that may be appealed to, the pulpit need not trouble itself with a discourse. James Harvey Robinson once defined a college as a place where there is a great deal of teaching but little learning. A similar in- dictment may be made against the pulpit unless the preacher has the proper concept of human nature and adheres to his concept when he prepares his sermon. 'Albion W.
