<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tillich's "Two Types" and the Transcendental Method John C. Robertson, Jr. For all his truly remarkable help to us in our attempt to think about religion within a wide setting, Paul Tillich has saddled us with a typology that is of only limited adequacy. I refer to Tillich's famous two types of philosophy of religion, according to which he distinguishes between the "ontological" and "cosmological" approaches to God.' Tillich's method in dealing with the problem is broad, inasmuch as he attends not only (or even primarily) to the questions of formal or logical validity of vari- ous "proofs" but also to what might be called, in a loose sense, phenomenological and existential concerns: that is, to the question of what the self is doing and suffering in its approach to God according to one or the other of the various options. I find Tillich's basic idea rich and promising in conception, but I must confess to finding it disappointing and misleading as it is worked out. In this paper, I will try to explain why I fault Tillich's argument, and I will try to improve on his position, or at least to describe resources for such an advance. In short, I will argue the need for a third type of philosophy of religion and will indicate how this type is being formulated. I First, let us consider Tillich's twofold typological account. Tillich charac- terizes one of the types, which he refers to as the "cosmological ap- proach" and attributes chiefly to Thomas Aquinas, as beginning with the external world or the world of nature as it is given to us in sense experience.2 One notices certain features of this world-for example, its 'This typology runs throughout the Tillich corpus.

Robert C. Kimball (New York: Oxford University Press, 1959), pp. 1o-29. 2For Tillich's description of the cosmological approach, see especially Theology of Culture, pp. 16-19, 26-27. 199</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion movement, apparent teleology, or contingency-and then, with the aid of certain principles (causality, 'sufficient reason,' identity, etc.), reason tries to move inferentially and conjecturally to a First Cause and Su- preme Being, which both explains and transcends the world. Even apart from questions of formal validity, Tillich judges this ap- proach inadequate. His most important objection is that the cosmologi- cal approach inadvertently makes God into a "stranger." The existence and character of God are, on this approach, less certain and intimate to man than the external world and his own powers of reason. God arrives, so to speak, too late: that is, only after the self has already constituted itself in a purely autonomous way. Moreover, the dynamics of the cos- mological approach are such that the total self is more or less left behind; the person is not brought along with the movement of the intellect. There is no unfolding or progressive illumination of the existent self, and the result is, at best, that man is brought to a merely intellectual assent to the bare proposition that there is a God after all. But richer and more existentially engaging "information" is to be sought elsewhere, perhaps by way of a "special revelation" which must be believed on authority. And faced with such an authority (e.g., miracles, inspired scriptures, infallible church, or whatever), the self is left to seek reasons for crediting this authority rather than another or for crediting any authority whatsoever. In this case, however, the authority becomes all but irrelevant, since it is one's autonomous reason that is actually trusted and followed and not the authority at all. Or, alternatively, the self can blindly submit to the authority, which is, of course, destructive of the critical and rational process and crippling to man's fullest personhood (in Tillich's language, this involves a heteronomous crushing of the self).3 In any case, on its best showing, the cosmological approach is inadequate because not self-contained, for it fails to comprehend an adequate resolution of the religious quest. And on its poorest, the cos- mological approach breaks down altogether, if in fact reason is finally unable to move from beings to Being-Itself (here Tillich is doubtless thinking of Kant's argument) and succeeds only in reaching a "being alongside of other beings," of the same modal status as a stone or a star, a 3Kant is, of course, a forerunner of this sort of criticism that argues on behalf of the autonomy of the person, and one to whom Tillich is greatly indebted. As is well known, Kant argues against the cosmological type of proof in the first Critique, argues for human autonomy in the second, and in Religion within the Limits rejects the idea of "special revela- tion" as a heteronomous interference with man's autonomy-i.e., as either irrelevant or destructive to the self. For short statements of Kant's position regarding revelation, see Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, trans. and introduction Theodore M. Greene and Hoyt H. Hudson (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., Torchbooks, 1960), esp. pp. 8o, 100-105.

Building on Tillich's critical insight, it seems that the cosmological ap- proach could easily lead to a ruinous state of affairs, for it is all but obvious that it is only a short step from the cosmological approach to man's dropping the quest for the Transcendent altogether. With the lack of fulfillment of the approach at its best and the utter disappoint- ment of it at its worst, it is easy for man to lose interest in the question of God altogether and to seek his satisfaction solely in the scrutiny of the external world, which may appear to him the only solid and intelligible reality there is, his only access to and locus of the real. In this case, he retains the cosmologist's starting point without retaining his aspirations for transcending it. What remains is bare reason confronting sense data-lifeless and devoid of ultimate purpose or value. A world so con- structed is only extrinsically related to the self (at least the self as reli- giously conceived). The scrutiny of this world becomes simply the activ- ity of a "value-free" science, a mode of apprehending the world that does not involve the self at its core-the heart of man with its passions, needs, concerns-with the result that the total self is neither profoundly challenged, moved, nor illuminated. In short, reason and that center of the self where acts of believing and valuing occur are split asunder and left to go separate ways. What is most real is the public, the external, the "out there," and the inner world-what remains of it on this account-is reduced to an existence basically parasitic upon the outer, a mere shadow of the external, the public. Technical reason has privileged ac- cess to the real, which in the nature of the case is "facts" devoid of objective "values" (to use a modern word) or "excellencies" (to use a classical one). However, the real (if the religious account or anything like it is true) center of the self-the interior believing, willing, valuing self-does not go away simply because a theory does not account for it. It does not disappear, but it can be left in a purely private, structureless realm, where it remains untouched by critical intelligence and where its func- tions can become purely arbitrary. In this case, the fact-value bifurcation is complete; it only remains to be noted that while the facts are acknowl- edged as objective, the values are reduced to an emotive status, subject only to idiosyncratic choice. 4Tillich, Theology of Culture, p. 18. 201</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion I think this particular modern tendency is a probable outcome of the earlier cosmological approach. This characterization goes a bit beyond Tillich, but I suspect he would not find it a misuse or illicit extension of his own insight that the dissolution of the cosmological approach leads to a lapse into "self-sufficient finitude."5 The other of the two approaches Tillich calls the "ontological ap- proach," and, as he found in Aquinas a representative of the first ap- proach, he finds in Augustine and Bonaventura representatives of the second, to which he himself adheres." He shows that the ontological differs from the cosmological approach in a number of important re- spects. Whereas the latter begins with the external world, the former finds its point of departure in the self's own experience of itself. The approach to God is not a journey without but a journey within, so to speak-through the many levels of self-consciousness to the inner chambers of the mind, where God is found as the ontological prius, present antecedent to the actualization of the self 's potencies, under- girding the self's awareness of itself. So we can say that if the cosmologi- cal approach aspires to God as the final term which stands at the end of the rational process, the ontological approach confesses to find God at the outset, at the base of one's experience, as an unmediated immediacy always already present to the self 's acts of self-constitution. The rational process is not one of inferring to God; rather, it consists of a progressive and illuminative unfolding and clarifying of the self's original con- sciousness of being grounded in the Unconditional, in Being-Itself, within which it lives, moves, and has its being. The superiority of the ontological approach over the cosmological approach is obvious, in my judgment, for both philosophical and religious reasons. The approach does not neglect the total self, for it includes not only the intellectual dimensions of man but also the more existential dimensions. In other words, the rational process is such that the self is not excluded but brought along with the acts of reflection. Moreover, God is so under- stood as to preclude man's feeling His presence to be that of a "stranger," since the God reflectively grasped at the end of the rational process is none other than the God who was present to the self 's awareness at the outset (and all along) as an "ingredient" of man's basic experience and as the law of his essential being. Hence, the self-conscious realization of the reality of God is neither irrelevant to nor destructive of man's autono- mous existence; indeed, the discovery is of the nature of a "homecom- 5For a penetrating analysis and critique of this "dissolution," to which I am indebted, see Iris Murdoch, The Sovereignty of Good (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1970), passim and esp. pp. 1-45.

Such a God, we may conclude, can concern the self ultimately and save him finally. Given, then, only the cosmological and the ontological approaches, Tillich's argument for the superiority of the latter is persuasive. I believe that it is only relatively superior, however, and this qualification is due to what I believe to be a serious flaw in the approach. The flaw stems from what I take to be a significant oversight on Tillich's part: he overlooks, I submit, the mediation of the experience of God (or Being-Itself, the Un- conditional, etc.). Tillich's ontological approach assumes that God, who is immediate to us perhaps in the "order of being," is also immediate to us in the "order of knowing." The self has only to turn within to ap- prehend immediately Being-Itself (ipsum esse)-unnuanced and, so to speak, all at once. I do not think that this direct form of introspection is an adequate account of the human cognition of anything. Attending only to what we may regard as phenomenological and existential con- cerns, however, and leaving aside the issue of formal or logical validity, it seems to me that Tillich's ontological approach is seriously deficient because, in effect if not by intention, it disengages the self from nature (within which, also, we "live, move, and . . .") and denies the mediating role nature has in our basic experience and thought. In fact, Tillich comes close to speaking as though the external world per se is irrelevant to our awareness of God, though perhaps he does occasionally allow that intersubjective relationships are important for religious knowledge. Even so, this qualification, if it is in fact to be found in Tillich, is insufficient, for the world which mediates to man his consciousness of himself and God is surely a world of both history (intersubjectivity) and nature. So, even if Tillich (unsystematically) allows for the mediating role of history, it is still the case that he neglects the parallel role of nature, and the result is that we find in Tillich's account one more version of "the soul and God-nothing else" (Augustine) that has so plagued Western religious consciousness. In short, I suggest that if the ontological approach gives us some knowledge of God and the self, it is a truncated and distorted achieve- ment, gained by a somewhat private, pietistic, and mystical flight from nature. Whatever its advantages over the cosmological approach, the ontological approach does perhaps even less to head off the modern reductionism of nature to bare, value-free stuff, simply "at hand" for man's disposal. This criticism may seem strange to one aware of Tillich's personal love of nature, his Lutheran quarrels with the Calvinists, and his rather romantic ways of speaking of the natural order.' Nevertheless, 7For examples of Tillich's more or less informal and nonsystematic expressions of ap- preciation for nature (indeed of something approaching nature mysticism), see his power- ful sermon, "Nature, Also, Mourns for a Lost Good," in The Shaking of the Foundations (New 203</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion whatever the value of such factors-which is great, we may readily admit-the point is that it is not clear that they are entailed by or con- tained in Tillich's account of the ontological approach. The only thing that would seem to follow from the ontological approach per se would be one form or another of the religious injunction against idolizing nature or anything else (since God alone is the Unconditional Ground of the self ). Naturally, we will not want to belittle the importance of the injunc- tion (nor underestimate the difficulty of keeping it). But we will see, I believe, that it alone is not remarkably illuminative of nature, of nature's real even if limited excellence, or of man's place in and responsibility for the world of relative existents." Tillich has short-circuited the movement from the self to God, and at a high price. (Granted, Tillich might invoke other types of religious insights to deal with this sort of question; but this would have the effect of showing that the ontological approach is not a self-contained account of an authentic approach to God after all-which is one of the charges leveled against the cosmological approach.) In light of this unhappy result, it is reasonable to assert that, if the positivists are only a short step from the disappointing outcome of the cosmological approach, the existentialists are only a short step from the disappointing outcome of Tillich's ontological approach. I mean that for many existentialists the "turn within" begun by the ontological approach has become so radical as to result in an anthropomorphism in extremis, with the result being that the external world has come to be regarded as altogether extrinsic to man (in Sartre's Huis Clos even other selves are so understood); nature has come to be regarded as either a mere object at man's disposal or even a nausea-producing "surd." And the upshot is York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1948), pp. 76-86; and his "Autobiographical Reflections," in The Theolog ofl Paul Tillich, ed. Charles W. Kegley and Robert W. Bretall (New York: Macmillan Co., 1952), pp. 3-22. One can hardly doubt that Tillich wanted to affirm the connection between philosophical-theological thought and nature. It is not at all clear, however, that his systematic thought really provided a very significant way to do this. The issue can be sharpened by comparing Tillich on this point with an empirically oriented thinker such as Tennant or Bertocci (or perhaps Wieman). Tillich speaks of "the Uncon- ditioned of which we have an immediate awareness, without inference," which we can trace out and "recognize in the cultural and natural universe" (Theology o fCuliure, p. 26). Ten- nant, by contrast, insists that one should "let the Actual world tell its own story and offer its own suggestions; not silence it while abstractive speculation ... weaves a system of thought which may prove to conflict with facts. The explicanda which [one] investigates, and the results of his investigation, alone will determine the content or essence of the explicative idea of God to which he is led .. ." (F. R. Tennant, Philosophical Theologn [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1956], 2:78). There is an obvious difference between "tracing out" or "recognizing in the cultural and natural universe" a content already derived else- where and actually allowing empirical data to lead one to the discovery and conception of that content itself. "James M. Gustafson makes a similar point when he writes, in discussing the tasks and accomplishments of Christian ethicists, that most "Protestant giants" have been stronger in proclaiming the dangers of confusing the relative with the absolute than they have been in helping us understand the true, even if limited, value of "various relative existents" ("The Transcendence of God and the Value of Human Life," Proceedings oJ the Twenty-third Annual Convention of the Catholic Theological Society, 23 [June 1968]: 97-98). 204</page><page sequence="7">Tillich's "Two Types" that the intrinsic, though relative, excellence of nature is lost and reason itself is disengaged from an objective structure; the locus of and access to the real is then sought solely within the interior of the self. Finally, even the substantial structure of a perduring self is swallowed up in a solitary and momentary event, the core of which is only unstructured freedom in an all-but-omnipotent will. The "self " arbitrarily wills and creates its values; the only value that stands over and against the self (and this minimal concession, which is usually only implied and not recognized, introduces some logical incoherence into the position) is the value of sincerity in the arbitrary creation of all (other) values.9 In sum, if it is the tendency of the cosmological approach to exalt the external world (objectively studied) in such a manner as to neglect, if not destroy, the interior world of the self, the ontological approach tends so to exalt the "turn within" as to neglect, if not destroy, the external world.10 In short, what is common to both approaches is the tendency so to divorce the inner and outer that religion and nature become mutually irrelevant. (This, of course, is not unrelated to the modern sundering of fact and value that has had such disastrous results in the contemporary Western world)." On the cosmological approach, the study of nature remains unillumined by whatever wisdom religion might offer, and on the ontological approach, the religious quest is resolved without the instruction of nature. Tillich, it appears obvious, manifests an under- standing of the former problem but not of the latter. If we do in fact judge both the options Tillich presents us with as seriously (though unequally) inadequate, and if we also continue to cred- it the religious quest, we are naturally prompted to seek a more adequate type of philosophy of religion or approach to God. Let us ask, then, whether it is possible to convert our understanding of the peculiar deficiencies of the two approaches, as well as of their respective strengths, into a sort of heuristic structure capable of directing our further inquiry and helping us assess possible alternative candidates. But, of course, we should not be inclined to accept an approach that did just this unless it was also capable of avoiding the curses of a shallow eclecticism, namely, logical incoherence and artificiality. Is there in fact such an option? 9Murdoch, p. 8. Schubert M. Ogden has forcefully shown this "logical incoherence" in The Reality of God (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966), pp. 126-43- 101 find support for this criticism of the ontological approach in John E. Smith, Experience and God (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), pp. 121-57, esp. pp. 122-34.

Certain qualifications must, however, be made at the outset. First, the approach I have in mind can be designated the "Tran- scendental Method"; however, as with the two approaches discussed above, it should not be understood as a precise description of a "school" of thought. Rather, it is a label which may be used for certain purposes to point to a basic line of thought that various members of a movement share. The Transcendental Method has already been developed in a variety of ways and continues to develop.12 Second, employment of the Transcendental Method is, in fact, basically a phenomenon among con- temporary Roman Catholic thinkers. There is no necessary connection between the Transcendental Method and the Roman Catholic faith; it is a philosophical method, which, while proving fruitful when applied to an analysis of religion, does not rest upon any sectarian articles of faith, nor is it another example of that hybrid thing called "Christian philosophy." And, although the Transcendental Method has not yet gained much attention outside of Catholic circles, there are already signs of its influence on a few of the more important non-Roman Catholic theologians.13 Nevertheless, that the Transcendental Method happens to be employed primarily by thinkers within the Catholic tradition creates two minor problems. On the one hand, Tillich's argument re- ceives less attention from them than from Protestant writers; hence, the relation of the Transcendental Method to Tillich's typology is not ex- plicitly dealt with in any of their writings so far as I am aware. On the other hand, the style and language (indebted to and shaped by medieval literature and specifically Catholic concerns) with which the Transcen- dental Method is usually developed and employed are not generally those fashionable among most Anglo-Saxon philosophers and non- Catholic theologians; hence it is difficult to be certain that one has grasped its full meaning and import for such purposes as ours here.'4 Finally, however, these comments are not meant to be pejorative or 12So writes Bernard Lonergan, perhaps the most important "Transcendental Methodologist," in describing the movement (Collection, ed. F. E. Crowe [New York: Her- der &amp; Herder, 1967], p. 203). 13See, e.g., Schubert M. Ogden, "The Challenge to Protestant Thought," Continuum 6, no. 2 (Summer 1968): 236-39; Langdon Gilkey, Naming the Whirlwind: The Renewal of God-Language (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1969), pp. 77, 226, 413, 423; George A.

His truly remarkable book Insight, while immensely demanding of its readers, is still more likely to speak to the Anglo-Saxon mind than many of the other works of the movement. This is the case both because, unlike most of the other works, it was originally written in English and, more important, because it deals with many of the issues that now engage British and American 206</page><page sequence="9">Tillich's "Two Types" patronizing. I, who am not a Roman Catholic, have found the Tran- scendental Method which some Catholics have discovered and articu- lated to be of immense interest and help with common problems (as I trust the argument below will show); in fact, I find it far and away one of the most promising options for dealing with many philosophical prob- lems, not the least of which is the one discussed in this paper.15 My comments are meant only to explain the limitations placed upon the discussion that follows. How shall we characterize the Transcendental Method?16 We can begin historically, by observing that it is a philosophical method that arose out of a rediscovery of certain central aspects of Thomas Aquinas. The thinker most often credited with initiating the rediscovery is Joseph Marechal of Louvain.17 Marechal's work, and the work of those influenced by him, has developed as a challenge to the traditional under- standing of Aquinas, for example, that of LaGrange, Gilson, and Mari- tain (and, derivatively, Tillich). Marechal has challenged the view of Aquinas as a dogmatic realist who must be understood as standing in direct opposition to the critical turn of philosophy begun by Kant. The Marechalians have argued that the traditional view of Thomas Aquinas is both historically misleading and philosophically unnecessary. Tradi- tional Thomism is unnecessary, they believe, because in a sense Aquinas himself initiated a critical turn in cognitional theory in his effort to ground a doctrine of existential being in the discovery of the "interior word."'8 Moreover, it is undesirable, since Kant's question concerning a critical grounding of knowledge is a legitimate philosophical question. So the Marechalians are defined by a positive response to the Kantian challenge. This does not mean that they have simply become Kantians, for they have not; they have found Kant's solution inadequate. Nor have they tried to trim Aquinas to a Kantian mold; rather, they have discovered resources in Aquinas which are, although underdeveloped philosophers. The other works, which are largely European, are more involved with con- cerns largely peculiar to German and French philosophy (Insight: A Study of Human Under- standing [London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co.; New York: Philosophical Library, Inc., 19571). 1'5 also find Whitehead's and Hartshorne's understanding of the "reformed subjectivist principle" a promising alternative to the cosmological and ontological approaches. In fact, I have tried elsewhere to show the remarkable and, I might add, seldom-noticed similarity between it and the Transcendental Method as developed by Rahner (John C. Robertson, Jr., "Rahner and Ogden: Man's Knowledge of God," Harvard Theological Review 63, no. 3 [July 1970]: 377-407). '6A comprehensive account is, of course, out of the question here. For such an account, see Helen James John, The Thomist Spectrum (New York: Fordham University Press, 1966); and Otto Muck, Die Transzendentale Methode in der Scholastischen Philosophie der GegenLart (Innsbruck: Verlag Felizian Ranch, n.d.). 17His key work is Le point de dipart de la mnitaphysique, 5 vols.

But the correction of Kant is possible, not by rejecting the Kantian problematic as a case of taking a "wrong turn" (Maritain) but by solving its difficulties from within; that is, it can be solved only by critically grounding a metaphysics of being. A complete account of this effort, especially one providing the full panoply of supporting data, is out of the question here.19 I should like, however, to highlight some of the salient conclusions of this line of interpretation and argument which are especially relevant to the discus- sion of this paper. The Marechalian line of thinking arises out of a sustained hermeneu- tical effort to discover the real Thomas Aquinas, the meaning of his thought within his own historical context. Previously a rather ahistorical understanding of Aquinas had prevailed (and still prevails in many quarters). Aquinas was read through the bifocals of the manualist tradi- tion of the seminaries, at worst, or perhaps, at best, simply through lenses not sufficiently refined to differentiate between Aquinas's pecu- liar emphasis and that of his several medieval contemporaries (as if Aquinas, Scotus, John of St. Thomas, et al. represented precisely the same line of thought). The careful ways in which, for example and by contrast, recent biblical scholars were working to understand, say, Saint Paul within the context of early Christianity and its "contemporary set- ting" had not been even approximated by students of Aquinas (or of other medieval figures, perhaps). This unhappy situation began to change with Maretchal and later with Rahner, Coreth, Lonergan, and others.20 The result of the new historical investigations was and is significant. Three of the chief findings have been delineated by George Lindbeck as follows: (i) The contemporary setting of Aquinas was thoroughly dominated by Augustinian Platonism and forms of Neo- platonism. (2) Aquinas's Aristotelian insistence on the a posteriori character of human knowledge was directed only against what Aquinas judged to be the excesses of the contemporary Platonists. And (3) it is more than likely that Aquinas should be interpreted as differing funda- mentally with his Platonic setting only when he explicitly affirms his difference; in other words, one should think of Aquinas as being a good deal more Platonic (and Augustinian) than would be readily apparent to us who live in an age which is quite different from Aquinas's (i.e., an age 1"For a good brief account and an examination of the Marechalians' historical interpre- tation of Aquinas, see Lindbeck (n. 13 above). 20The reasons for this change would be a topic in itself; doubtless, the refinement of the methods of historical research, attention given to the philosophical issue of hermeneutics, and, of a different order, the new atmosphere created by Pope Leo XIII's program of vetera novis augere et perficere played an important role. Gilson's work also should be noted, for, although one defining characteristic of the Marechalian interpretation of Aquinas is a definite break with interpretations such as Gilson's, some of the current Marechalians express indebtedness to Gilson's initial historical spadework. 208</page><page sequence="11">Tillich's "Two Types" dominated by scientific and empirical mentality rather than by Platonism).21 Aquinas, as seen in this perspective, differs in important ways from the Aquinas of Tillich's account (which was dependent upon the widely prevalent older account of Aquinas held by Thomists them- selves). A complete justification of the new view of Aquinas would, of course, require a full discussion (and justification) of each of the points just stated. This is, of course, beyond the scope of this paper (and my ability). (For that matter, new theories, even in the natural sciences, often re- quire the combined effort of generations of scholars to achieve definitive verification or falsification.) Here, however, I should like to explain something of its meaning, especially as it relates to the issues and ques- tions set before us by Tillich's typological scheme. I will also give some indication as to why it may be judged plausible. Point 1, regarding the prevalence of certain forms of Platonism in the thirteenth century, is not likely to be contested once attention has been drawn to the historical evidence for the assertion. Besides, since the other two points rest upon it, whatever can be offered to show their force will concomitantly supply about as much in its favor as can be offered in this limited context. So let us assume its truth for now. In regard to 2, the Marenchalians agree with the conventional convic- tion that for Aquinas all knowledge begins, in some respect or other, with empirical experience. Indeed, considering the ample textual data, it would be impossible not to do so. Aquinas clearly agreed with Aristotle on this, as is shown by his famous and oft-quoted adage, "Nihil est in intellectu, quod non prius erat in sensu [nothing is in the intellect which was not previously in the senses]."22 The general idea of this adage is clear enough; however, its exact, refined, and complete meaning is not so clear. If it is simply taken to mean, as the conventional interpreters have taken it, that Aquinas was anticipating John Locke in saying that the mind is a tabula rasa and that literally everything that the intellect could contain is simply the result of an (unexplained) association of sensations, then one must wonder about other things Aquinas affirmed. For example, where does he think we get the first principles of the mind, the principle of causality, the principle that the whole is greater than a part, the principle of contradiction, etc.? One could assume, of course, that Aquinas was either careless on this point, simply letting these first principles slip in sub rosa, or guilty of affirming the uncritical position that somehow or other the mind "extracts" these principles from neces- sarily limited samples of empirical data. Either of these explanations is possible, of course, but the price of accepting either involves assuming that Aquinas was not a very careful thinker. There is also some strong 21Lindbeck, passim. 22S.T. I, 84-85. 209</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion textual counterevidence: namely, Aquinas's sparse but unequivocal references to the "light of the agent intellect."23 (References to this "light" increase and assume an even more prominent place in the later stages of Aquinas's development.) The metaphor of "light" rightly puts one in mind of Plato and Augus- tine. The latter spoke of God's presence to the mind in the act of think- ing as being analogous to the sun's presence to the eye in the act of seeing. It is, in short, only because the metaphysical principles of being (of which God is the ground and "chief exemplification") are present to the mind a priori that the mind can make anything of its experiences at all. This is true for Augustine and Aquinas. Augustine characteristically speaks of the "lumen intellectus" and Aquinas of "lumen animae nostrae" (and both speak of "participatio creata lucis increatae"). The similarity is striking. Augustine discusses the role of the "light" more than does Aquinas. This could be taken as a warning against doing too much by way of Augustinianizing Aquinas. Or one might assume that, because of the prevalence of Augustinianism in the air, Aquinas did not feel a need to belabor an Augustinian point. Indeed, his intention was to balance Augustine's Platonism with Aristotle's empiricism. The reader will have to make up his own mind. The Mare'chalians strongly favor the latter interpretation. At any rate, there remains the problem of internal coherence. On the one hand, there is the commonly recognized a posteriori, empirical side of Aquinas, associated with the adage quoted above. On the other, there are the newly discovered but nevertheless indubitable a priori elements in Aquinas's cognitional theory: the first principles and the "light." Can they be put together? They can hardly be put together if we accept only these two "terms" and try to interpret one by way of the other. The deliverances of sense experience cannot be deduced from a priori factors (not even Hegel tried to do that, Herr Krfig to the contrary notwithstanding). Nor can a priori elements meaningfully be said to be inferred from limited samples of sense data. Are we to say that Aquinas tried to ride two horses, one Augustine's and the other Aristotle's? Fortunately, no; the resolution comes from recognizing a third term. I refer to Aquinas's doctrine of the conversio ad phantasma. The newer studies help us to see that this doctrine took on more and more importance in Aquinas's development and that it is the doctrine in terms of which the a posteriori and a priori elements are to be rightly understood.24 23E.g., 1 Sent. 17, 1, i, c; De Verit. 9, 1 ad 2 and 14, 8 ad 4; S.T.

The doc- trine is elaborate, hence a detailed discussion is not possible here. It is possible and necessary, however, to call attention to several aspects of the act. (1) There is no knowing of anything whatsoever apart from the act. (2) The act is triggered by sensory experience. (3) The act of knowing, as the word conversio would warn us, is not a merely passive affair whereby an inert tabula rasa merely registers sensations. Rather, the active intel- lect energetically converts the sensations into imaginative images. (4) The act of converting is possible only by virtue of the presence to the mind of the previously discussed "light" and the first principles. In short, the act of knowing involves a posteriori and a priori elements; however, the latter, no more than the former, can be known to be apart from an (a posteriori) experience of man with the world which activates the process. In this perspective we can understand the adage about nothing being in the intellect that was not in the encounter between man and the world: no experience, no knowledge of anything. Our knowledge of whatever we know (including God) is "abstracted" or "unpacked" from the conversio ad phantasma. This way of seeing Aquinas, of course, puts one in mind of Kant's account of cognition, whereby knowing, while dependent upon a pos- teriori percepts (Anschauung), is also equally dependent upon a priori factors (concepts and regulative ideas of reason). This is at first, no doubt, a startling conclusion, but it is one of the central contentions of the Marechalian line of interpretation. To be sure, it is an exaggeration indeed to claim that Aquinas was Kant before Kant or even that he exactly anticipated the German philosopher's critical philosophy. This would be as ahistorical a way of interpreting Aquinas as the conventional interpretation was in the opposite direction. It would, moreover, be to claim not only too much in one (obvious) respect, but also too little in another: it would fail to show how Aquinas provides the basis for doing any more than Kant himself was able to do by way of developing any "future metaphysics." After all, as Marechal puts it, "... metaphysical affirmation will victoriously maintain itself.., only if it can show that not only is it 'morally' or 'practically' necessary, but that it is also 'theoreti- cally' necessary."25 Kant, as is well known, failed to do this. Without underestimating the difficulty of going beyond Kant in this regard, the Marechalians boldly proclaim that there are resources in Aquinas sufficient to permit an advance on this front and that it is possible to establish an ontology even while affirming the critical turn in philosophical method. This is the agenda of most of the constructive (as opposed to historical) work of the Marechalian program. It is beyond the limits of this paper to describe in any great detail the steps in their 25A Markchal Reader (n. 17 above), p. 5. 211</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion argument, much less assess its claim to success. My point here is more modest: namely, to draw attention to this new understanding of Aquinas with regard to the problem Tillich has focused on and thereby to indi- cate why one can no longer assume the obviousness of the sheer opposi- tion conventionally made between Aquinas and Kant.26 Nor, more im- portant for the topic under discussion here, can one safely assume a sharp opposition between Aquinas and Augustine. Tillich can hardly be blamed for seeing only the opposition between the two, dependent as his interpretation was upon the understanding of Aquinas so prevalent only a few decades ago. Given the continuing influence of Tillich's typological scheme, however, and given the availability of the relatively recent Marechalian work on Aquinas, Tillich's view cannot go unchallenged.27 In Tillich's view, it will be recalled, the a posteriori aspects of Aquinas's thought are emphasized to the total neglect of the a priori aspects. I have attempted above to show why this might well be regarded as a distorted view. Tillich also argues that in Aquinas's account God is reached, if at all, only at the end of an inferential process and then too late and as a "stranger." In light of the above correction, I should now like to indicate why I believe that this also is a misinterpretation. To understand the way in which the mind and God are related to each other in the new interpretation, let us attend again to the metaphor of the "light" of the mind. How is God's presence to the intellect analogous to the sun's presence to the eye in the act of seeing? How is God present to the mind? Recent advocates of the Transcendental Method specify at least three ways. First, God functions as something of a "lure" (to use Whiteheadian language); that is, the dynamism of the rational process of seeking to understand and know the world is activated by what Karl Rahner calls a Vorgriff aufesse, an anticipatory awareness of, or prelogical and preconceptual trust in, being and that which grounds being.28 One is reminded of Whitehead's similar contention that reasoning is possible only by virtue of a "trust that the ultimate natures of things lie together 26Examples of the "opposition"' theory are too numerous to mention. For one of its best expressions, see Etienne Gilson, Rialisme thomiste et critique de la connaissance (Paris: Vrin, 1939); see also almost any of Maritain's works. 27Clark M. Williamson has recently written an article with much of which I have some sympathy and appreciation ("Tillich's 'Two Types of Philosophy of Religion': A Reconsid- eration," Journal o Religion 52, no. 3 [July 1972]: 20o-22). Williamson accepts Tillich's account of Aquinas uncritically, however. If Tillich can be excused on account of the respective dates of his education and the availability of the new studies on Aquinas, it is more difficult to excuse a current writer. This oversight seriously detracts from Williamson's otherwise thoughtful presentation. 28Rahner, esp. pp. 142 ff. This emphasis of the time is most prominent in Rahner and Emerich Coreth. See the latter's Metaphysics, trans. Joseph Donceel (New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1968), passim, esp. chap. i. The emphasis is not so prominent in Lonergan, but it is not absent (see "The Natural Knowledge of God," Proceedings of the Twenty-third Annual Convention of the Catholic Theological Society 23 [July 1968]: 54-69; and his discussion of '"genuineness" as the prerequisite of rationality [Insight, pp. 475-79])- 212</page><page sequence="15">Tillich's "Two Types" in a harmony. ... "29 The point is that reasoning is not a self-contained activity. (Nor is Aristotle's "pure desire to know.") A "step back" from such activity reveals that prior to it is a love of and trust in the Good. Put differently, the effort to know being is elicited by and dependent upon a prior confidence that reality is worth knowing and patient to our at- tempts to know it. Such a trust is at least implicitly a trust in that which grounds the order of being which is to be known. Second, God is present to the understanding as a standard in terms of which reality can be defined. The attempt to understand is a struggle; we strive for the real, but we realize how imperfect our grasp of the real really is. Hence, we realize that the awareness of the imperfection of our understanding (which we try to overcome) presupposes an awareness also of a noncoincidence of reality understood and reality as it is. Yet "reality-as-it-is-and-yet-unknown" is an odd notion, and it is useless as a standard of knowledge, for real truth (or reality) cannot be defined apart from reference to some mind. Truth must be defined with refer- ence to an adequate form of knowing, that is, being clear, coherent, comprehensive, certain. The perfect exemplification of these traits, then, gives us the only adequate definition of perfectly adequate knowl- edge and hence of truth and reality. The real (what the mind aims at) cannot be defined simply as "reality" without involving circularity. The real, then, must be taken to be the content of perfectly adequate, coher- ent, and certain mental activity. Knowing what and how things are means knowing that coincides with ideal knowing. Things as they really are means the contents of perfect knowledge. The upshot, then, is that when we understand our efforts to understand, we understand more than we may explicitly understand that we understand. We understand that reality is always more than we have grasped. So we are aware of a comparison, one that involves two terms: our imperfect understanding vis-a-vis a perfect understanding and knowledge. And our striving to understand better, more clearly, with less bias, with a wider comprehen- sion, etc., is a striving to overcome the gap between the two terms. We try to bring our minds into a correspondence with truth as defined by a perfect mind, that is, God's (ipsum intelligere). To be sure, this ideal is beyond our reach, but it does function heuristically in the work of our disciplined and guided intelligence. It is an ideal that functions from the beginning to the end of our mental strivings.30 Third, God is present to the mind in the final and decisive stage of cognition, namely, that of judgment, as that reality which the mind affirms in affirming that anything is so. I referred above to Aquinas's 29Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modern World (New York: Free Press, 1967), p. 18. See also Schubert M. Ogden's development of this point (The Reality of God, esp. pp. 120-43). 30Lonergan, Collection, pp. 221-39, esp. p. 228; Insight, chap. 19. 213</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion doctrine of knowing as the conversio ad phantasma. If we dwell a bit on this, we can perhaps understand the sense of God's presence I am now referring to. To know is to convert raw sensation into a phantasm (to objectify it) and to affirm it. But the objectification is possible only by virtue of a screen, or horizon, against which, so to speak, the real but limited character of the object can be grasped. Such a horizon is a priori in the sense that it is not itself an "object" of experience; it is rather the luminous background for the objects. To judge that a given object (or state of affairs) is so is possible only by also coaffirming that its horizon is real.3' Of course, there are limited horizons: for example, the table of elements in chemistry, aesthetic standards in art criticism, the idea of the good society in politics. To affirm that any relative thing is real, however, whether it is an "object" or a limited horizon, is to affirm that the whole of which these are parts is also sufficiently real to be able to warrant the limited judgment. In a word, all judgments coaffirm the reality of the thing explicitly judged and the ultimate horizon of being implicitly pres- ent. "God," of course, is the name of the ultimate horizon. In this sense, we can understand Aquinas's statement that "all knowing beings know God implicitly in everything they know."32 The above, obviously, is far from a complete account of the newer understanding of Aquinas and the line of thought I am referring to as the Transcendental Method. Still it can serve to define the contours of the general stream. Let us then begin bringing the present exercise together and ask how this interpretation (of Aquinas and the cognitional opera- tions) stands with regard to Tillich's typology. In one respect, the Tran- scendental Method begins at the same point as Tillich's ontological ap- proach: for if the latter can be said to begin with a "turn within," the former can be said to begin with a "turn toward the subject."33 This means that both the ontological approach and the Transcendental Method welcome the post-Cartesian (and biblical) insistence upon the human subject as man's privileged access to the real. But there is also a difference. This "turn" does not mean for the Transcendental Method introspection or any attempt to gain, by way of a Platonic remembrance, a blissful state that supposedly precedes ordinary a posteriori experience (against Tillich's ontological approach). Rather, it means an attending to and appropriation of what is involved in and revealed by ordinary acts of experiencing, understanding, judging, deciding, and acting. In Kantian language, it seeks to discover and explicate the transcendental condi- tions involved in man's knowing objects in time and space. So, in this respect, the Transcendental Method is similar to the cos- mological approach. It argues against Cartesianism, rationalism, on- tologism, certain forms of mysticism, and, by implication, Tillich's on- "3S.T. 1, 85, 3; 1, 86, 1.

Without it we know nothing; and without experience of the world there is no conversio. This insistence makes the Transcendental Method similar to the cosmological approach, but there is a difference. The Transcendental Method does not hold that the place it accords a posteriori encounters excludes the possibility of coming to know a priori factors that may be ingredients in cognition. As a matter of fact, this account claims that the analysis of cognition discovers in the act of knowing both a posteriori (empirical and contingent) and also a priori (transcendental and necessary) factors. Let us now focus on the issue of the discovery of .God. It will be remembered that Tillich characterized the cosmological approach as follows: (1) The mind begins with observing the physical universe; (2) it then infers, with the help of the category of causality, etc., the existence of God as an explanation of the world (or at least as a "rational probability");35 (3) hence the encounter with God is not "immediate" (as Tillich's ontological approach would have it) but "mediated." Tillich's judgment is that this approach "delivers" God too late, as a "stranger," who because of his mediated and only probable arrival cannot concern man ultimately. His reality is of the same modal status as that of other beings or objects: "...[it] brings God's existence down to the level of a stone or a star, and it makes atheism not only possible, but almost un- avoidable. .. .",36 Against this, however, the Transcendental Methodologists insist that, while our knowledge of God, like our knowl- edge of anything else, requires the conversio ad phantasma, which in turn requires encounter with the world, reflection on the cognitive process reveals that God has been and is present to the self all along as that reality which grounds and illuminates the mind, whether he is explicitly recognized or not. It is only because of the presence to the mind of the ultimate horizon that the mind can function at all. For example, we can recognize the many, the conditioned, the finite, the contingent, etc., only by seeing them against the backdrop of that which is one, uncon- ditioned, infinite, necessary, etc. As Coreth puts it, "All of our knowl- edge contains an original, immediate knowledge of the necessary and 341t is true that most advocates of* the Transcendental Method tend to understand "experience" primarily in terms of sensations. I recognize that this classical form of empiri- cism can be forcefully challenged, in different ways, by fiollowers of Hegel, Bergson, Whitehead, Dewey, James, Heidegger, and lphenomenology in the name of a broader concept of experience. See, e.g., Smith, pp. 20-45; and Schubert M. Ogden, "Lonergan and the Subjectivist Principle,"Journal of Religion 5 1, no. 3 (July 197 i): 155-72. 1 happen to agree with their contention, although I do not feel that it is pertinent here, since the Transcendental Method asserts primarily that some experience of the world is the sine qua inon of' cognition, however experience itself is understood. 35Tillich, Theology o Cultlure, p. 19. 36lbid., p. 18. It is instructive that Tillich relies explicitly on Gilson's interpretation here, as elsewhere. 215</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion absolute character of being.""3 This is, to repeat, the meaning of Aquinas's insistence that God is always known implicitly in everything that is known.38 The rational activity of the mind, then, is not at all an inferential movement to a distant term (whose existence is only probable at best). Rather, it is a clarifying and unpacking activity, whereby the a priori and necessary ground and structure of all a posteriori knowledge are clarified, thematized, and appropriated.39 Now let us dwell for a moment on the issue of the "immediate" versus the "mediate." Tillich claims that on the ontological approach, which he favors, God is present to the mind in an immediate way. He quotes Bonaventura with approval: "God is most present to the very soul and immediately knowable.'"40 Knowledge of God is "not mediated by in- ferential processes."4- He charges the other approach, the cosmological, with advocating a "mediated" way of knowing God. It should now be clear why neither of these ways of thinking adequately describes the Transcendental Method. On the one hand, it would be misleading to speak of God as being known immediately, since we never know God without at the same time encountering and knowing finite entities. In other words, God is co-known with the world. There is no experience or knowledge of God that is not also and at the same time experience and knowledge of other beings. On the other hand, it is equally misleading to speak of our experience and knowledge of God as being simply mediated. To speak in such a way suggests that God is not experienced from the outset but is only inferred from something else. But, in the Transcen- dental Method, as we have seen, God is co-present to the self from the outset. The Transcendental Method begins with an experience, the conversio ad phantasma, and seeks to make explicit the presence of a reality, God, who was implicitly present from the outset. Clearly, then, neither of Tillich's terms adequately describes this approach. Doubtless it is possible to find a third term. Coreth has spoken of a "mediated immediacy."42 And John E. Smith, in a very illuminating and critically appreciative discussion of Tillich, acknowledges the need for a third term and suggests the word "direct" (as opposed to "immediate").43 However it stands with regard to finding an adequate third term, the main point is that we should regard the Transcendental Method as a 37Coreth, p. 174- 39De 'erit. 22, 2, ad i. 3"". . . [T]he knowledge of God does not really represent a passage of our mind to something hitherto wholly unknown but only an explication and development of our knowledge.. ." (Coreth, p. 175).

In this account these realities are inseparably given; they are always co-known. We know our- selves only as selves engaged with the world and God; we know nature only as it is coram Deo; we know God only as he is given "in, with, and under" the beings of this world. Even beyond showing that this is so, it seems to me that this new approach suggests rich possibilities of developing a far-reaching pro- gram of thought and a cooperative effort between metaphysics and the special sciences. This is so because it permits a remarkable division of labor and unification of knowledge in the inquiries concerning God, man, and nature. Lonergan seems to me to have best helped us to see how this might be. I will only sketch here some things that, to my under- standing, are involved in his reflections on method. First, metaphysics as the most general science can do some things but not others. What it can do, hopefully, is grasp and explicate the invariant structure of human cognition, that structure which is present in all specific acts and departments of knowledge (e.g., in common sense, mathematics, the physical and social sciences, theology, etc.). It can thematize what all cognitive acts have in common, including the tran- scendental conditions of their possibility. If it succeeds, the achievement is important indeed. By so doing it manifests the backdrop or ultimate horizon within which our labors can have ultimate worth. Moreover, by grasping what all our cognitive acts have in common it prepares the way for the further understanding of the respective distinctive traits or specific types and departments of knowledge and their respective roles in the unfolding and dynamic drive of the exigent self toward self- actualization in knowing. Put differently, by grasping and clarifying the ultimate horizon of cognition in general, it is thereby also possible to grasp and clarify the various relative horizons that are peculiar to specific cognitive acts and disciplines.44 This is the possible contribution of that most general science of metaphysics to the special sciences and common sense. But the interplay between such a general science and the special sciences is a two-way affair; the special sciences can add to the deliverances of metaphysics in man's efforts to understand and know reality. By this I mean that the subject of metaphysics is of necessity bare, general, and abstract. (It grasps the "whole" that is in knowledge but not the whole of knowledge.) But reality is, naturally, more than such in- variant principles; reality is these principles plus concrete, contingent, specific, and factual determinations. Such facts, moreover, can only be known by specific experiences, understandings, and judgments: in short, by the special sciences (and everyday experience). Hence, while 44See David Tracy on "horizon analysis" (The Achievement oJ Bernard Lonergan, foreword Bernard Lonergan [New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1970], chap. i). 217</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion metaphysics can make its contribution to human knowledge by clarifying its ultimate horizon and invariant structure and by unifying its specific "moments" in a hierarchically ordered structure, the special sciences can contribute by delivering the richer and more specific determinations of what happens to be so in a variety of concrete and particular cases. With reference to the religious question, metaphysics can clarify and vindicate our right to believe in the reality of God. Moreover, it can thematize our "natural" (or better, original) knowledge of God in his, so to speak, necessary and general features. But empirical studies (of na- ture and history) can conceivably add to this general knowledge further understanding of God's actual and contingent dealings with the world. They can do so by being taken up into the discipline of philosophical theology, which aspires to grasp the contingent facts of being and the necessary principles of being in their mutual relatedness in a com- prehensive vision of reality. To be sure, this is an ideal which can only be remotely approached; but, of course, even a remote, asymptotic ap- proach is worth striving for. It is just such an achievement that the Transcendental Method seems to me to promise and give some indica- tion of making possible.45 45Central to Tillich's criticism of the cosmological approach is his contention that it is not self-contained, that the connection between the approach to God via "general" experience and the approach to God via "special" revelation is extrinsic and hence artificial, forced, and arbitrary (Theology of Culture, pp. 17 ff.). This criticism loses its force when applied to the Transcendental Method, for at least two reasons. First, man does not know God apart from encounter with the "natural" and historical universe. Man is naturally oriented to- ward God, to be sure, but of necessity to God as He is disclosed in the world. Hence man is also constitutionally oriented toward the world, within which all revelations, both "general" and "special," occur. Second, man's general metaphysical knowledge of God can easily recognize itself as being incomplete and open to augmentation. That is, metaphysical knowledge discloses only the bare essence of God, the a priori "outline" of the Transcen- dent. But God, like finite persons, is more than a bare essence. His being is necessarily constituted by necessary essence plus contingent and freely instantiated self- determinations. Since these determinations are contingent upon his free election, they cannot be known by metaphysics, which deals only with what is necessary and a priori. They are known only via a posteriori encounters. But while metaphysics cannot tell us what these contingent determinations will be, it can alert us to the fact that there will be some (in addition to the initial self-determination of the creating of the contingent universe as a whole). So it follows that (a) general knowledge orients us toward whatever "special" revelations there are or will be in nature and history; and (b) while "special" knowledge of God is more than "general knowledge," the relationship between the two is intrinsic, not extrinsic; special revelation fulfills the incomplete nature of metaphysical knowledge (con- trary to Hegel). As a matter of fact, this line of criticism can easily be turned against Tillich's own ontological approach. It could be argued that the tightly self-contained character of the ontological approach makes any "special" revelations superfluous: every- thing that could be known about God is already given, on the ontological approach, prior to any encounter with the contingencies of the world order. Faith only "traces out" in the contingencies of the world what is always already given by the self 's meditations on its own necessary structure. Contingent revelations, then, can only be mere re-presentations or re-publications of truth already fully known. If Tillich wants to understand revelation as being more than this (and he may), it is difficult to see how he could make this move and still claim that his ontological approach, unlike the other approach, is self-contained and complete. 218</page><page sequence="21">Tillich's "Two Types" To summarize, in the first section I tried to show that Tillich's ontolog- ical approach is inadequate, while agreeing with his faulting of the cos- mological approach. I concluded that section by showing the need for another approach. In the second section, I argued that the Transcen- dental Method provides a third and superior option and hence that Tillich's typology is not exhaustive of significant options. Incidentally and ironically, it seems clear on the basis of the discussion above that the thinker who Tillich claims to be the chief representative of the ill-starred cosmological approach, Thomas Aquinas, is the chief inspiration for what is perhaps the right candidate for a needed breakthrough on this problem. It simply is no longer possible to regard Aquinas in the way in which Tillich characterizes him, as the historical studies accompanying the recent development of the Transcendental Method have shown. And it is no longer possible to regard Tillich's typology as exhaustive of important approaches to God or his ontological approach as the most adequate approach. The systematic development of the Transcendental Method is demonstrating this, or, at least, so it seems to me. 219</page></plain_text>
