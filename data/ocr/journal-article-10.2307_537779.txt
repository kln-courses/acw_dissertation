SIMMONS Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales ~~~A INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM LTHOUGH folktales have been recorded and studied by many scholars, the study of the culture of a society as reflected in its folktales has been primarily the concern of anthropologists. Two central problems arise in any attempt at assessment of culture reflected in folktales: (1) are all cultural aspects reflected with equal em- phasis, and (2) does the cultural content of the folktales accurately reflect ethno- graphic data? These problems can only be investigated by actual comparison of the cultural information obtained by systematic analysis of folktales with ethnographic data. This paper compares cultural data reflected in the folktales of the Efik, a West African society located in Calabar Province, Nigeria, with ethnographic data on the Efik obtained from field work and historical documents.' As early as 1834 William J. Thoms, who coined the neologism "folk-lore" in 1846, noted that fables were of value for the depiction of society in which they occur.2 However, the first known attempt to utilize the cultural content of preliterate folk- tales as ethnographic data is Rink's 1875 analysis of Eskimo traditions,3 while the first major attempts at correlation of ethnographic data and folktale content were those of Franz Boas in his 1916 and 1925 investigations of Tsimshian and Kwakiutl mythology.4 Subsequently, detailed studies of the relationship between ethnography and ethnographical content of folktales and myths have been made by Ehrlich (1937) for the Crow,5 Spencer (1947) for Navaho origin myths,6 and Elbert (1956-7) for the role of the chief in Hawaiian mythology.7 The results of the aforementioned studies vary. Boas states:8 It is obvious that in the tales of a people those incidents of the everyday life that are of importance to them will appear either incidentally or as the basis of a plot. Most of the references to the mode of life of the people will be an accurate reflection of their habits. The development of the plot of the story, furthermore, will, on the whole, exhibit clearly what is considered right and what wrong. From these points of view it seemed worth while to review connectedly those ideas which are either implied or described in detail. Material of this kind does not represent a systematic description of the ethnology of the people, but it has the merit of bringing out those points which are of interest to the people them- selves. They present in a way an autobiography of the tribe. On the basis of Boas' studies, Herskovits asserted that "... a substantial body of folktales is more than the literary expression of a people. It is, in a very real sense, their ethnography which, if systematized by the student, gives a penetrating picture of their way of life."9 Herskovits later states that ". . . this reflection of culture, how- ever, is not the equivalent of a scientific ethnographic description, any more than myth can be considered as the equivalent of written history."10</page><page sequence="2">Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales The conclusions of Ehrlich's Crow study support Herskovits' 1948 viewpoint, since she states:11 The picture of Crow life drawn from their folklore is very nearly as complete as that given in the ethnological accounts. And in a few instances the tales are the richer source. While the folk tales occasionally suggest an interpretation differing from the one given by the ethnologist, there are no conspicuous omis- sions or ambiguities .... If we were to lose the ethnological studies made of the Crow Indians and re- tain solely their folklore, we could still reconstruct with surprising accuracy the culture of the tribe. An occasional and minor phrase might be shrouded in vagueness and certain details missing, yet the fundamental scheme would be retained, with the cultural traits seen in a dynamic setting. Spencer, although finding substantial agreement between recorded ethnography and information on Navaho social life abstracted from the Navaho origin myth, notes that a number of discrepancies occur.12 Elbert also detects differences between Hawaiian ethnography and the customs reflected in Hawaiian mythology,13 while Wittfogel and Goldfrank find that the important Pueblo elements of agriculture and irrigation do not receive commensurate recognition in Pueblo mythology.14 The general methodology of these studies is, firstly, the collection and analysis of a body of folktales in order to systematize the cultural data contained therein, and, secondly, comparison of the abstracted cultural information with ethnographic data in order to ascertain similarities or differences. The problem of cultural reflection in folklore can theoretically be analyzed in several ways. Firstly, folklore and ethnographic data may be obtained from a single individual, thus giving information as to the reflection of idiosyncratic cultural content in idiosyncratic folklore. Secondly, folklore (or ethnography) may be col- lected from a single individual and compared with ethnography (or folklore) obtained from several individuals. Thirdly, folklore collected from several indi- viduals may be compared with ethnography obtained by standard ethnographic techniques utilizing multiple informants. The initial two approaches have largely been ignored in past studies, probably because ethnographic interest centers on societal norms of behavior rather than on idiosyncratic behavioral norms. However, the first approach could be utilized in studying the development of an individual's knowledge of folklore-how a folktale develops in plot complexity as the individual himself matures. Such a study could be commenced by collecting folktales from children and then collecting the same tales from the same individuals at subsequent intervals; this, however, requires an extended period of time to complete. The present writer has initiated such a study by collecting tales from Efik children, whom he hopes to contact at a later date. This study of Efik folktales also represents the third approach, and is based on an ethnography obtained by standard ethnographic techniques and a collection of folk- tales derived from many informants of different ages. In addition, previously pub- lished collections of Efik folktales are used. No attempt was made by the present writer to collect folktales from some pre- conceived viewpoint as to the "real" nature of mythology and the folktale. Rather, all types of tales, myths, legends and traditions were transcribed without any attempt at artificial selection. Neither has an attempt been made to distinguish between kinds 127</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore of Efik folktales; the indigenous classification of myths, legends, and historical stories as mbuk while animal folktales are denoted along with riddles, proverbs, tongue twisters and puns as jke, does distinguish between animal-tales and other types of folktales, but this distinction has not been utilized in the present study (for the complete Efik classification of their folklore see Simmons'5). The sources of the Efik folktales are four: (1) The present writer's manuscript collection of 134 folktales, comprising approximately 673 pages of interlinear trans- lated Efik text and contained, along with miscellaneous ethnographic texts, in six quarto volumes,16 (2) Elphinstone Dayrell's 1910 published collection of 40 folk- tales,17 (3) one extensive folktale published by Richard F. Burton,18 and (4) one short folktale published by Gaskin.19 COMPARISON OF EFIK CULTURE AS REFLECTED IN FOLKTALES WITH ETHNOGRAPHY ANIMALS. Mention of geographical features and meteorological data rarely occurs, although flora and fauna receive frequent citation and allusion to all Efik domestic animals occurs. Animals are anthropomorphized in many folktales, but no correspondence exists between the roles culturally assigned animals, especially in connection with the ukparj animal-soul beliefs and various omens, and those roles relegated to them in folktales. The fact, for example, that tortoise is repeatedly depicted as a folkloristic trickster does not prevent Efik from sacrificing it. Similarly, although the atakpot lizard possesses the folkloristic status of a diviner, it lacks any known divinatory function in ethnography. AGRICULTURE. The main agricultural pattern receives accurate delineation, especially details of farm making and yam cultivation. The information includes the location of the farm outside the town, preparation for planting by clearing and burning the bush, and crops of maize and yam, the latter being planted with yam- sticks in February. The absence of reference to manioc, bananas, plantains and taro is noteworthy in view of their importance nowadays. The absence of reference to manioc is probably due to the recentness of its importance in Efik agronomy; pos- sibly the same reason explains the fact that taro is unmentioned. The reference to farm produce being transported home in the daytime might indicate danger in travelling at night, especially under aboriginal conditions of ubiquitous slave catchers, warfare, and voracious animals. Of more interest, perhaps, is mention of the woman who planted a large farm even though she was childless, thus permitting an inference that farm size may have been correlated with family size. Mention of slaves as farmers refers to conditions extant prior to 1914 when the status of slave existed and the majority of slaves were employed as farmers. HUNTING AND FISHING. Reference to hunting and fishing are in inverse pro- portion to actual importance, since fishing is seldom mentioned. Accurately por- trayed is the use of the bow for small animals, the gun being reserved for larger game, such as antelope and monkey. Arrow-poison is mentioned in one folktale but does not now occur and undoubtedly refers to a time prior to the introduction of firearms. Because of their use of tephrosia fish poison, their varied materia medica and the widespread use of arrow-poison among neighboring Ibibio, Ekoi, and Ibo, it is extremely probable that Efik once utilized it, although memory of its use is now forgotten, the bow itself nowadays being a mere child's toy. 128</page><page sequence="4">Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales Although trapping is mentioned in the form of pit traps and bamboo fish traps, the diverse types of animal traps are omitted, as is mention of the crossbow. FOOD AND FOOD PROCESSING. The information on food and food processing de- picts the general ethnographic pattern but omits most of the detailed recipes found in the ethnography. The folktales reveal, however, the importance and diversity of food, the pattern of feasts given by the chief, and the human desire to possess an always-available supply of food as shown in such tales of magic drums and magic yam trees. Needless to relate, such drums and trees have no real counterpart in Efik material culture. The mention in one folktale of poison being put in food undoubtedly reflects the Efik belief that usage of poison is widespread. Whether this belief is factually based constitutes a moot question, but it is believed to be so by the Efik, who frequently warned the present writer not to drink palm wine always at the same place in order to obviate any attempt at poisoning him. OCCUPATIONS. All occupations mentioned in the tales now occur with the ex- ception of obot esio 'pot maker'. Although Efik slaves were once employed as pot makers, pots are now imported from Ibo villages located in the Afikpo region of the Cross River. MARKETS. Data on markets are ethnographically accurate. Special market days existed for each market, and women who traded regularly at a market possessed their own stalls. The goods displayed for sale at a market, however, are much more ex- tensive in type than indicated by the few references in the folktales. Moreover, there is no reference in the tales to the fact that markets never occur on akwa ederi 'Calabar Sunday'. HOUSES. The information on houses contained in the folktales presents an ac- curate picture since doors, crossbar, roof, mud walls, and yard receive mention. Chicken coops and goat sheds are located in the backyard, as is the latrine, while fences frequently are built around houses. The only acculturative influence noted in the tales is the enyaj two-storey house, which, however, has been present among Efik since at least 1785 (see Simmons20). No mention occurs of recent housing de- velopments, such as the use of concrete blocks and tin roofs, nor are shutters men- tioned. Shutters are probably a recent development, since they are lacking in the houses of many neighboring groups which have had less European contact than the Efik. CLOTHING AND ORNAMENTATION. The patterns of Efik dress are fairly-well de- lineated, and clothing differences due to status are indicated, although no con- clusions can be drawn as to the exact type of everyday dress. Aside from mention of gold and silver ornaments, there is no indication of change in clothing due to ac- culturative influences. MEDICINE. Main diseases, presence of medical specialists and the use of clysters are indicated in the folktales, but the majority of herbal medications, as well as their specific composition, receive no mention. The ethnographic data give a much superior picture of actual remedies than can be obtained from folktales. MATERIAL CULTURE. The items of material culture incorporated into the folk- tales reveal that materiel is well-reflected. The following list includes all material items mentioned in the ethnography but omitted in the folktales, except for certain recent items and food and medicinal recipes. 129</page><page sequence="5">Journal of American Folklore abaj3a abasi udo ekoi afara afia ebirj afia inuen afia ndiduok afia iyak akarjka3j akparjkpari akpara atat eborjko ayarj ayara bzwut ndom ebekpo ebia ebomo eborjko eduat edu iban ekak ekanem obon ekarj ekara ita ekorj ekorj ukwa ekorj unana eka ekorj itok ekpat obzn ekporoko ekpuk uruk esik ata abasi esik obu esik ukoi iyak eso ntibe etimai etioro ewat idibij ifiet ifim mbakj ikerj ikim ikon ikpafak ikut ikpari isim iso ekpo itiat uwam itam mbor) itembe chisel special costume sail porcupine trap kind of bird trap kind of bird trap kind of automatic fish trap double-headed iron signal gong brass tray pennant Leopard Society costume large broom gourd cup special bowl filled with chalk used by rjkuhD 'fattening' girls European-type throne seine needle yam hill Leopard Society costume spear bend knot ring used in ekak game kind of costume kind of costume loop knot kind of headdress headdress of ukwa society costume of unana eka society costume of a boys' play sacred rattle of obon society costume of Ekpri Akata society knobknot shrimp net trawl net sco,' ', net kind of special pot kind of knobknot small bells used on leglets Turk's head knot property mark kind of broom special Leopard Society stool fish gaff with one hook hollowed gourd compound xylophone wedge boys' play costume wicker basket Leopard Society costume mask kind of fishing apparatus sleeping mat kind of membrane drum 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. 46. 47. 48. 49. 50. 51. 52. 130</page><page sequence="6">Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales itor) iwomi ibak kwa imuk mbofat mbutu mfine mkpanuen ndo ubup mkpete mkokobi mkpoho mkpokporo mukana nabikim ndido uruk ndo nimba nsa nsa ebak nsa nsadari nsak nsan nsihede ntat nsim ntari ntimi ntinya ntirj obon nyamkpe ikene jikikan jkorj rjwemme obufim oku akama okuriso ndem okpo okpo okpoho okpoho ubDk okporjkrorj omum ikpat omum itor) oti owuk kisorl far3) isin ofor) mkpa akpaor otombe otonyum sitim udok isor automatic-door fishtrap kind of trumpet kind of special cup patchwork cloth sansa deadfall engagement ring conical fishtrap chain sinnet conical basket fishtrap boys' play costume large fish net human effigies used in boys' play musical bow kind of large bead conical fish trap cup-like depression of game seed anklet bamboo sticks used in game rattle pitfall loop knot conical fishtrap fish weir gourd stamping-tube Efik crown kettle drum Leopard Society costume iron announcement gong kind of tray iron gong memorial shed round basket Leopard Society costume ceremonial mirror boys' play costume game apparatus consisting of sand wrapped in cloth to which raffia streamers are tied Leopard Society costume bracelets special costume kind of animal trap kind of animal trap circular gong large umbrella loin cloth shroud kind of fishhook arrangement cannon kind of costume copper wire currency kind of animal trap 53. 54. 55. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67. 68. 69. 70. 71. 72. 73. 74. 75. 76. 77. 78. 79. 80. 81. 82. 83. 84. 85. 86. 87. 88. 89. 90. 91. 92. 93. 94. 95. 96. 97. 98. 99. 100. 101. 102. 103. 131</page><page sequence="7">Journal of American Folklore ufvk obon ukwa ukwoho umen abari mmin umia obot unana eka uruk ebot usam uruk uyit owo utiha ekwa uto uyet iso uyo ekpri akata uyo enarj uyo ikwot uyo nsek eyen uyo ikwok uyo obon bozn society shed sword tin food grater combination knot flat-sided wood tool used for smoothing mud sodality costume buntline hitch fish gaff with two or three hooks hangman's knot crossbow yellow chalk mourning shed kazoo bullroarer toad-sound simulator mechanism simulating sound of crying baby mechanism simulating buzz of bee kind of sacred rattle KINSHIP TERMINOLOGY AND KIN GROUPS. Kinship terminology used in folktales contains all consanguineal terms except those for maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, paternal grandmother and grandchild. Affinal kin terms include terms for 'husband' and 'wife' and the correct term for 'in-law' but omit the descriptive terms which distinguish various kinds of in-laws. From the terms incorporated in the folktales, however, it is possible to determine that Efik kinship terminology is Sudanic. There exists a notable lack of data on kinship groups, such as the ekpuk, ubon and uftk. Creek Town ward names occur only in the historical legend; it would be impossible, solely on the basis of their occurrence in the folktale, to determine what the names actually represented. Folkloristic information on kinship groups permits the inference that the polygynous family is the basic kinship unit, but does not permit any inference as to whether more extended kinship units exist. MARRIAGE. Reflected in the folktales are the girl's right to negate a parentally- chosen spouse, payment of brideprice by the groom which is later refunded to him if the woman commits adultery, polygyny, capital punishment for adultery, ideals of female beauty, rJkuh3 "fattening" seclusion, jealousy of co-wives, divorce pat- terns, the use of love-medicines on husbands, and the jealousy of a husband for his wives. It is unclear from the data whether or not the village is exogamous; in actu- ality, neither village endogamy or exogamy is prescribed, and both occur. Only one instance of incest is recorded, and this in the creation tale given by Burton (1865)-a tale undoubtedly the product of an Efik acquainted with the Christian origin myth as introduced by Presbyterian missionaries.21 In this tale, brother-sister incest occurs and represents an explanation of how the offspring of the first man and woman found marriage partners; it is probable that this creation legend is idiosyncratic and not part of normal Efik folklore. Unmentioned in the tales are incest prohibitions, detailed procedure of bride- price prestations, coition rights of polygynous wives, sex practices, odirjp 'acquaint- anceship' alliances, and clitoridectomy. CHILDREN. The folktale data corroborate the ethnographic information on chil- 104. 105. 106. 107. 108. 109. 110. 111. 112. 113. 114. 115. 116. 117. 118. 119. 120. 121. 132</page><page sequence="8">Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales dren. Efik fear to die childless since then there will be no descendants to sacrifice to them; moreover, a childless wife frequently loses her husband's love. Pregnancy also represents a time of anxiety as shown by the instances gleaned from folktales. Although twins were always killed, twin infanticide is mentioned only once in the tales. The use of folktales as a medium of moral instruction is clearly shown in those tales which concern rewards for good actions and punishments for bad actions. FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. The information on family relationships reveals the normal love for children felt by parents and also the conflict which family life can engender. The instances of poisoning of an elder brother by his younger brother with inheritance as a motive, and the instances of murder within the nuclear family are not representative of normal Efik behavior; the reason for their occurrence in folktales undoubtedly is psychological, and such acts presumably instance desires normally repressed. Also reflected is the Efik realization, frequently referred to in proverbs, that anyone without a family must fend for himself. The familiar step- mother motif is present, she being depicted as partial to her own children and fre- quently maltreating the children of a deceased co-wife. NAMES The denomination of individuals, based on the name of the day on which they are born, is represented in the folktales, all male day names occurring but two of the four female day names (Ikwz and Afia3J) being omitted. Many of the names are common Efik personal names, but a few, such as Ikrikrj, are uncommon. Names involving the morpheme abasi 'God' are not actually names used by real individuals, but simply humorous cognomens. The custom of disliking to have one's name shouted appears to be reflected in one tale. Most of the neighboring groups are represented in the folktales, although the Oron, Ekoi, and Efiat are unmentioned. PLAYS AND GAMES. The Efik propensity for plays and games is depicted in the plays, dances and wrestling matches mentioned in the folktales. No reference, how- ever, is made either to the many ceremonies held by Efik sodalities or to the four- teen out of fifteen children's and adults' games mentioned in the ethnography. FOLKLORE. The folklore abstracted from the folktales reveals the existence of tales, stories, proverbs, songs, tongue twisters, nicknames and curses, and some type of recitation, although failing to notice riddles, tone riddles and commemorative poetry. Thirty-one children's songs, none being previously recorded in the ethnographic collection of songs, reveals that the folktales represent an excellent source for chil- dren's songs. Thirteen of the twenty-two proverbs contained in the folktales do not appear in the collection of 655 proverbs, but nine do appear either in exactly the same form or with slight textual variation. Explanations of natural phenomena in folktales are incorrect from a scientific viewpoint, while the explanations of Efik social customs shed no information on the origin or rationale of the behavioral norms. Three of the eight customary greetings appear in the folktales, although the eti- quette pattern requiring inquiry of the individual's health is totally ignored. The presence of a few nicknames is adequate evidence of their occurrence in everyday life, but it would be impossible to determine their relationship to drum- signalling solely on the basis of their appearance in the folktales. 133</page><page sequence="9">Journal of American Folklore FUNERAL, BURIAL AND MOURNING. The folktales reflect the human sacrifices which formerly accompanied burial of a high-statused individual, special inhumation practices for the chief, memorial feasts, disposal of slaves' corpses by simply throw- ing them into the bush, and ritual wailing of female mourners (undoubtedly alluded to by mention of a woman raising a cry at cockcrow). Unmentioned in the tales are burial of freeborn males in the house, mbukpisi mourning for widows, the utim udi ceremony, rjkz society burial ceremony, erection of rjwemme memorials and uyet iso sheds, and the modern burial practices of Efik Christians. CHIEFS, GOVERNMENT, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. The role of the chief in enforcing laws and adjudicating disputes before the Leopard Society, his wealth and power, is accurately depicted, as are the various capital punishments employed. The chiefs Eyo Nsa, Archibong Edem, Effiong, Adam Duke, Ephraim Duke, and Eyamba are known to have been actual individuals, and this is probably also true for other chiefs mentioned, except for certain chiefs whose existence is confined solely to folktales and who usually bear some form of the name abasi. The coronation ceremony of the chief received no mention in the folktales. Laws against murder, adultery and accidental homicide coincide with ethno- graphic reality, but such laws decreeing capital punishment for defecation within town limits, argument, anyone named Ekpenyong, and the like, are simply to pro- vide plots and lack any ethnographic counterpart. WARFARE. The data on warriors and warfare are correct, although information on the ekpa women's ceremony, the warriors' ediyzor ekr3j ceremony, and the patterns of surrender and treaty-making are absent. It may be noted, however, that the number of fisheagle feathers worn in the warrior's panache is given as three in the folktales but is unmentioned in the ethnography. Also unmentioned in the ethnography is the practice of throwing magic-medicine on the roof so that it can drain off on the warrior's head-similar customs being noted only for the chief's coronation and the aboriginal marriage ceremony. The use of drums as signalling devices is clearly demonstrated in the folktales. SECRET SOCIETIES. The importance of the Leopard Society is reflected in the folk- tales, the society being assigned the functions of enforcing the chief's commands and inflicting punishment. However, mention occurs only of the rjkanda Leopard grade, the four other grades being omitted. Description of the various costumes worn by members is also lacking, although the wearing of a peacock feather to sym- bolize Leopard Society membership and the origin myth of the mb3kb, the secret noisemaker which stimulates the leopard's roar, are correctly indicated. The obon society is mentioned, although its function is obscure, but the various grades and costumes of the society are omitted. No reference is made to the ekpri akata, ukwa, enana eka, and ekaij men's societies, or to the iban isarj women's society. AGE GRADES. The folktale data indicate the presence of age grades, and reveal how the agemates of an individual aid in mourning a member's deceased relative. The use of the morpheme da between members of the same age grade does occur in tales, but its usage probably would not be discerned by anyone not previously acquainted with it. SLAVE. The two major classes of freeborn and slave are mentioned in the folk- tales and, although the former are not specifically designated by the customary term of eyen isor 'child of the soil', the inferior status of the latter is apparent in the tales, 134</page><page sequence="10">Analysis of Culttural Reflection in Efik Folktales which reveal that possession of slaves indicated wealth, parents could enslave a child or themselves, slaves were used in canoes, the murder of a slave was interpreted as an insult to the slave's owner, and the fact that slaves sometimes plotted against their masters. FRIENDSHIP. The best-friend pattern is reflected in the tales, which indicate that one's best friend is usually a member of the same age grade. The blood-oath to in- sure faithfulness and prevent treachery among friends also receives mention, as does the Efik realization that friends may quarrel and even prove false. RELIGION. In the folktales appear data on belief in a supreme deity, supernatural powers, akarj 'vow', magic-medicine, soul-affinity of men with animals, two types of divination (afia aran and esere; for an ethnographic analysis of Efik divination see Simmons22), sacrifice, oaths, prayers, witchcraft, importance of the number seven, belief in ghosts, and the sacredness of certain days on which work is forbidden. Al- though there is a paucity of information on variant types of divination and omens and reincarnation remain unmentioned, most of the major Efik supernatural ideas can be successfully reconstructed from the folktale data. Mentioned in the folktales but absent in ethnographic reality, are work on akwa ederi, various magical items of materiel such as magic trees and drums, and a lizard associated with divination. Work on akwa edeni day is strictly forbidden, and the explanation for the breaking of this taboo in a folktale is presumably psychological. The lizard has no known connection with divination among the Efik; one specu- lative suggestion is that the idirj crown worn by Ibibio diviners is covered with lizard skin-however, informants were unable to state what type of skin actually covers the Ibibio crown. Incidents involving dreams are rare in the folktales, which possibly may correlate with the difficulty the present writer encountered in his attempt to elicit information on informants' dreams. HISTORY. The Efik historical legend agrees with known linguistic and historical facts except that there is no evidence for the assertion that Efik were originally Ibo who came from Ibom, Arochuku. Unfortunately, information on the Ibibio and Aro inhabiting the Arochuku area is scant, but there is a possibility that Efik represent the Ibibio group driven out of the Aro country by the famous Ibo warrior Oke Nnachi (see Simmons23). It is improbable, however, that the majority of Efik were ever speakers of the Ibo language. PROPERTY AND WEALTH. Efik pecuniary interests find reflection in the folktales where mention occurs of aboriginal rod money, loans, individual ownership of property, and concepts of wealth, especially as a criterion of high social status. The ethnographic correlation of wealth with prestige undoubtedly accounts for the Efik 'Horatio Alger' success motifs where poor orphans obtain sudden wealth through the beneficence of some chief, stranger or old woman. Absent in folktales are such customs as ukpe okuk, property marks, incorporeal property concepts, acknowledgement of debt before witnesses, udu3k mmou, and etibe saving societies. EMOTION. The data on emotions depicted in folktales shed some insight into acts which occasion fear, gladness, grief, hatred, and annoyance. Although no specific recognition of emotion occurs in the ethnography, information can be gleaned con- cerning annoyance, anger, jealousy, insultive behavior, sadness, contempt, embar- rassment, and variant personality traits. 135</page><page sequence="11">Journal of American Folklore ANALYSIS OF CULTURAL REFLECTION IN EFIK FOLKTALES Comparison of culture reflected in Efik folktales with Efik ethnography reveals that folkloristic data may be grouped into three main categories: (1) similar to ethnographic data, (2) present in folktales but absent in ethnography, and (3) present in ethnography but absent in folktales. If ethnographic information were unavailable, the folkloristic data on Efik culture would appear to constitute a veritable ethnographic treasure trove illumi- nating many phases of culture previously obscure, since reflected in the tales are numerous traits concerned with agriculture, medicine, hunting, domestic animals, food processing, crafts, economics, folklore, musical instruments, kinship termin- ology, social stratification, political organization, and events of the individual life cycle. Indeed, comparison of the ethnographic information obtained from folktales with Efik ethnography as known in 1950 (cf. Forde and Jones24) shows that the folk- loristic data are more informative. Incidents occurring in folktales but absent in ethnography are the assignment of anthropomorphic roles to animals, capital punishment decreed for such crimes as defecation and argument, several humorous cognomens utilizing the morpheme abasi 'God', rapid success in obtaining wealth and status on the part of poor orphans and good children, homicide within the nuclear family, and work on akwa ederi day. The anthropomorphic roles assigned to animals require little explanation in terms of Efik ethnography; such roles are widespread among Ibibio groups, who are the closest relatives of the Efik, among other African societies, and among Euroasian societies. Efik customs do not explain why such roles should be assigned animals, and the explanation presumably lies in the realm of cultural diffusion since the phenomenon is widespread in the Africo-Euroasiatic folktale area. The folkloristic laws which possess no ethnographic analogues are explicable on the basis of either humor or usefulness in plot development. Certain of these folk- loristic laws reflect sarcastic jibes at the propensity of chiefs to pass proclamatory laws. Similarly, the names involving the morpheme abasi also represent a sublima- tion of aggressive sarcasm against chiefs by attributing both humorous names and stupid actions to chiefs extant only in folktales. In ethnographic reality, no Efik would dare make sport of his chief; only in folktales can a chief be portrayed as stupid, humorous, and the possessor of such a typically-human proclivity as jealousy. The motifs of rapid success in accumulating wealth and high status undoubtedly owe their existence to daydreams and wishful-thinking; every society, such as the Efik, which places a status-premium on wealth will undoubtedly possess such motifs so that its members can enjoy vicariously what, in actuality, is seldom experienced. The frequent references to homicide within the nuclear family are likewise explic- able as outlets for aggressive impulses directed towards parents and stepparents. The ethnographic facts similarly contradict the folkloristic incident mentioning work on akwa ederi-the Efik religious day on which work was expressly forbidden; this violation of a well-established taboo presumably gave an emotional shock to the hearers, possibly even representing a psychological outlet for a suppressed desire. Many cultural traits lack mention in the folktales. Completely omitted are refer- ences to manioc, bananas, plantains and taro, details of many Efik food recipes, the majority of herbal medicinal recipes, one hundred twenty-five items of materiel, the ekpuk, ubon and ufAk extended kin groups, fourteen of fifteen children's 136</page><page sequence="12">Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales games, incest prohibitions, details of the brideprice prestations, coition rights of polygynous wives, adiorjp marital alliances, circumcision and clitoridectomy, sexual practices, riddles, tone riddles, commemorative poetry, house burial, mbukpisi mourning for widow, utim udi memorial ceremony, rjko society burial, rjwemme memorials and uyet iso memorial sheds, modern burial practices of Christian Efik, coronation ceremony of the chief, ekpa ceremony, warrrior's ediyzrz ekorj ceremony, patterns of surrender and treaty making, four Leopard Society grades and their respective costumes, the ekpri akata, ukwa, enana eka, ekarj and iban isnj sodalities, omens, belief in reincarnation, and several kinds of divination. Also unmentioned are the economic practices of ukpe okuk, property marks, in- corporeal property, acknowledgement of debts before witnesses, uduDk mmDor and etibe saving societies. Various hypotheses may serve to explain the reasons so many culture traits lack mention in Efik folktales: (1) the sample of folktales is inadequate, (2) un- mentioned traits are regarded as unimportant by the Efik, (3) unmentioned traits constitute recent innovations, (4) unmentioned traits are simply behavioral norms which Efik take for granted, and (5) unmentioned traits are unsuitable material for folktales. The hypothesis of inadequate folktale sample asserts that omitted culture traits would have received mention if additional folktales had been collected. The im- plicit assumption of this hypothesis is that folktales accurately reflect ethnography, and, hence, omission of traits is prima facie evidence that the folkloristic sample is too small. This hypothesis, at present, can neither be confirmed nor denied since it has not yet been established what constitutes an adequate sample of folktales. It appears a priori obvious that the greater the opportunity for culture traits to be mentioned, the greater is the probability that they will be mentioned; however, since no agreement exists as to what number constitutes an adequate sample, the only scientific method is simply to state that the conclusions represent the results of analyzing a specified number of folktales. The hypothesis that cultural traits unmentioned in folktales are unimportant, with its implied corollary that mentioned traits are important, is susceptible to verification. The corollary was evidently first enunciated by Boas, who stated:25 The underlying thought of this attempt was that the tales probably contain all that is interesting to the narrators and that in this way a picture of their way of thinking and feeling will appear that renders their ideas as free from the bias of the European observer as is possible. Wittvogel and Goldfrank have previously challenged the verity of this hypothesis since they did not find the culturally vital factor of irrigation reflected in Pueblo mythology.26 Efik traits omitted from mention in Efik folktales reveal that many important items, as well as many items of lesser and minor importance, lack mention in the folktales. As for the "importance" of some unmentioned traits, it may be noted that Efik have successfully resisted both missionary and governmental opposition to clitoridectomy, and their resistance signifies that the trait is evidently of im- portance to them. Similarly, many Efik still adhere to house burial and now resort to the subterfuge of burying an empty coffin in the cemetery in order to obviate 137</page><page sequence="13">Journal of American Folklore any difficulty with the authorities over their retention of this illegal custom; the subterfuge which Efik practice argues that this custom is highly valued by them. Other customs which lack mention in the folktales and yet are of undoubted im- portance to the Efik include extended kin groups, incest prohibitions, brideprice prestations, coition rights of wives, sexual practices, the utim udi ceremony, and the ijko burial society. Consequently, it may be concluded that the hypothesis of cultural traits being unmentioned in folktales because of their unimportance lacks universal validity since some unmentioned traits are definitely important. Mention or lack of mention of a trait in folktales does not ipso facto imply its importance or unimportance. The data do not substantiate the hypothesis that traits mentioned in folktales represent traits which are older than unmentioned traits. As regards age of traits, three chronologic periods can be conveniently distinguished for the Efik: The first is the time prior to the occupation of the Calabar area by the Efik, which com- menced about 1650, plus or minus fifty years; this period will subsequently be re- ferred to as the "archaic" period. The second period represents the interval be- tween 1650 and the advent of Presbyterian missionaries in 1846. The third interval is that demarcated by the arrival of Presbyterian missionaries until the present. It is usually possible to assign traits to the appropriate chronologic category on the basis of (1) distributional evidence, (2) nature of the trait, (3) historical docu- mentation, and (4) native tradition and testimony. For example, judging from their present distribution among Ibo, Ibibio, and other societies of the lower Niger area, such unmentioned traits as circumcision, clitoridectomy, and house burial represent Efik customs of considerable antiquity, undoubtedly possessed by the Efik prior to occupation of their present position in the Calabar area. Of the nonmaterial culture traits mentioned in the folktales, the majority rep- resent traits present in the archaic culture. Traits which entered the cultural in- ventory between 1650 and 1846 include the use of cloth for clothing, various Leopard Society costumes and grades, and, probably, the esere Calabar bean ordeal. Modern traits include the church, school, English words, and English mode of calendrical reckoning. The majority of nonmaterial Efik culture omitted from reference in the folktales similarly stems from the archaic period, while only the coronation ceremony (some elements of which are undoubtedly archaic) and the Leopard Society grades entered Efik culture in the interim between 1650 and 1846. Of ninety items of materiel mentioned in the folktales, sixty-eight represent items possessed by Efik in the archaic period, eighteen were introduced into the cultural inventory between 1650 and 1846, while four entered Efik culture subse- quent to 1846. Of one hundred twenty-one items of materiel unmentioned in the folktales, one hundred one represent items possessed by the Efik in the archaic period, sixteen entered during the interim between 1650 and 1846, and four constitute recent introductions. Concerning the hypothesis that unmentioned traits in folktales represent be- havioral norms which are simply taken for granted, Spencer writes:27 That important aspects of culture should be treated thus in myth is a priori somewhat unconvincing and is certainly not consistent with the conclusions of empirical investigations. Malinowski's analysis of Tro- briand origin myths shows that they convey and express "the fundamental 138</page><page sequence="14">Analysis of Cultural Reflection in Efik Folktales fact of local unity and of the kinship unity of the group of people de- scendent from a common ancestress." Actually, however, this hypothesis is by no means a priori unconvincing to the present writer, who thinks that it may be valid for certain traits. In every society there exist some traits which are applicable to every member, as well as other traits which apply only to a major or minor percentage of the group. It is precisely in the area of universal behavior norms that the taking-for-granted of traits would be expected. Thus, for example, the fact that all male and female Efik are respectively circumcised or clitoridectomized may account for the absence of any reference to circumcision and clitoridectomy in Efik folktales-Efik simply assuming these traits for the personae of their folktales. A similar explanation would account for the absence of incest prohibitions in the tales. The hypothesis that certain traits remain unmentioned in folktales due to their general unsuitability as folkloristic material, together with its corollary that mentioned traits constitute suitable material, is very difficult to prove or disprove. It probably can best be investigated by crosscultural comparison of mentioned and unmentioned traits in order to determine if there exist some types of traits which are consistently excluded from mention in folktales. If a trait frequently appears in the folklore of many societies, it evidently constitutes suitable folkloristic material. The converse also is true; if a trait is frequently unmentioned in the folklore of many societies known to possess the trait, it is probably unsuitable as folkloristic material. In general, what types of traits are suitable or unsuitable folkloristic material will probably be found to constitute a statistical question once enough comparative studies of cultural reflection in folklore have been made to permit percentage computation of presence or absence of traits. The ethnographic data incorporated in Efik folktales reflect many facets of daily life with accuracy, especially in the realms of economic activities (agriculture, domestic animals, food processing and hunting), kinship terminology and family relationships, folklore, social stratification, political organization, behavioral norms of the life cycle, and supernatural concepts. With the exception of folklore, these categories are similarly well-documented for the Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, Hawaiian, Navaho and Crow societies.28 Kinship terminology may illustrate a single trait which consistently appears mentioned in the folktales of societies. While not all terms may be reflected, the majority of a society's kinship terms, especially those concerned with the nuclear family, will occur in its folktales. This is true for the Efik, and for the Tsimshian, Hawaiian, Navaho and Crow.29 The apparently universal appearance of kinship terms in folktales is explicable by the universal functional importance of kinship for social relations. Folktale personae do not act in a cultural vacuum, but are placed in typical social settings of the society. Since reflection of kinship terms in folktales occurs for all analyses of cultural reflections, it would be of exceptional interest if folktales of a society ever failed to reflect its kinship terminology, and such failure would require a special explanation phrased, presumably, in terms of some special aspect of the society's culture. As regards nonmaterial traits which apparently are unsuitable for folktales, it may be noted that manufacturing and technological processes are rarely described in Efik folktales; a similar observation on Hawaiian tales has been made by El- bert.30 The probable reason for this lack of mention of manufacturing and tech- 139</page><page sequence="15">Journal of American Folklore nological processes is simply that they lack the dramatic quality necessary to capture and hold the audience's attention; a surfeit of descriptive rendition of commonplace technological processes would bore the audience. Systematization of cultural data reflected in Efik folktales does not approximate, in any sense, an ethnography of the Efik. Comparison of the folkloristic culture with ethnographic data clearly reveals that the latter is by far the better source for description and understanding of Efik customs. If, as Ehrlich once suggested for the Crow, ethnographic data on the Efik were lost and the abstracted cultural in- formation obtained from folktales retained, the general culture pattern of the Efik could be accurately reconstructed, but much interesting and important data would be missing due to its omission in the folktales. The fact that so many traits, important and minor, can be omitted from folk- tales, emphasizes the general principle that such omission per se can never consti- tute valid ethnological evidence. Thus, for example, Elbert states that the rarity of infanticide in Hawaiian myths is evidence that infanticide was infrequent in ancient Hawaiian culture.31 No doubt exists that Efik deliberately murdered all twins, but mention of twin infanticide occurs only once in the folktales; without knowledge of the actual occurrence of twin infanticide, it would be impossible to determine whether or not the folkloristic instance represented ethnographic fact since it might simply be another instance of folkloristic murder with the nuclear family. Even if it were correctly interpreted as evidence for the occurrence of twin infanticide, its single occurrence would probably lead to the erroneous conclusion that it represented idiosyncratic behavior. Consequently, it may be enunciated as a general principle that omission or infrequent occurrence of a trait in folktales never ipso facto represents valid evidence for ethnological inferences. Possible explanations for the discrepancy between the results of the analysis of cultural reflection in Efik folktales and Ehrlich's conclusions respecting cultural reflection in Crow mythology32 are: Firstly, it may be that just as societies vary in culture, world view and emphasis, so do they differ in the amount of culture con- tent reflected in their folktales and, consequently, the answer to the question of amount of folkloristic cultural reflection differs from society to society, ranging along a continuum of variability, from a small amount to a relatively large amount of cultural reflection. Secondly, possibly societies which possess elaborate mytho- logical systems are predisposed to include a greater amount of folkloristic cultural reflection than are societies, such as the Efik, which lack elaborate mythologies. Thirdly, perhaps there exists a process which, for want of a name, may be desig- nated folkloristic feedback-simply meaning that mention of a trait in folktales insures it greater chance of remembrance under conditions of radical culture change than possessed by a trait which is unmentioned.33 Thus, under conditions of extensive culture change, such as have occurred to the Kwakiutl, Tsimshian, Crow, Hawaiian, and Navaho, a narrator of folktales might be forced to give didactic explanations of a trait occurring in his folktale in order to make it intel- ligible to hearers of younger generations.

It is not unlikely that some explanatory matter has been included in the tales that in olden times would not have been present. On the whole, however, my impression is that only a slight amount of descriptive material has been introduced in this way. University of Connecticut Hartford, Connecticut</page></plain_text>
