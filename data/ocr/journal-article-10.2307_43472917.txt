<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAY HAREL "It's Dogged as Does It": A Biography of the Everpiesent Canine in Charles Darwin's Days "Polly died/' Emma Darwin, Charles's wife, noted in her diary for Thursday, April 20, 1882. That was the day after Darwin himself died. Polly was a terrier mix who first belonged to their daughter, Henrietta. When Henrietta married, she entrusted Polly to her father, as others had done with their superseded dogs. The grand man of science doted on Polly, according to his son Francis, and taught her cute parlor tricks. Polly became "perfectly devoted" to Darwin after a litter was taken from her, Emma wrote her daughter, and guessed that she had adopted him as her puppy. Polly licked Darwin's hands with an "insatiable passion," he wrote in The Expression of the Emo- tions in Man and Animals. She followed him underfoot, as certain as a shadow in a desert. Days she spent in his study in a pillowed basket on the hearth. Nights Emma had "to drag her away" from his side, she told Henrietta. Just about when Darwin suffered the heart attack that proved fatal, Polly "became very ill with a swelling in her throat . . . creeping away several times as if to die," Francis wrote. The canine urge to suttee is the stuff of dog legend, of course. Non- dog-people will persist in calling such events apocryphal, no matter how many diaries and memoirs recount them. Maudlin hogwash, they will harrumph. They will see as the cold cause of Polly's death a hap- penstance illness or Francis's consequent euthanasia. But "the word 'cause'. . . is an altar to an unknown god; an empty pedestal," William James told us, and dog people will say Polly died of heartbreak. They will say, too, that even the drunkard's dog story is true. The dog stories in Darwin's life are the usual - sad and silly, mundane and inspiring. Some stories sparkle with Darwin's joy in dogs, some shimmer with tears, and some light up the ordinary depths of canine companionship. But all glow with the radiant passion of a man who saw "one living spirit" in the myriad forms of life, as he confided in</page><page sequence="2">Harel /369 a notebook, a man who took a most profound pleasure in the ant, the orchid, and a thousand and one other organic oddities. Because the plain fact of the matter - as embarrassing as it may be to a few - is that the evolutionary theorist who upended modern Homo sapiens culture way back when, was, when it came to dogs, a sentimental sap. And every dog he ever knew knew it too. Pranks, Guns, and Biophilia The child Charles was the father of the observant experimen- talist. And dogs, as he commented decades later in The Descent of Man, offered "the best opportunity for observation." Francis recalled one of his father's boyhood stories, about a prank he would play on a hunting dog. Charles would have a confederate restrain the dog out of sight while he ran around a garden then climbed up a tree. The dog was then released, and Charles "had the fun of watching it" seek and find his scent, sniff along to his tree, and sight him perching. To an ethologist, interested in animal behavior in the field, the game doubles as a nicely controlled experiment, cleanly demonstrating the tracking skill of the dog. The child Charles also understood the heart of dogs. He was "an adept in robbing their love from their masters," he boasted in his otherwise modest autobiography. Growing up, he repeatedly stole the affections of his sisters' dogs - family lore that no doubt eased Henrietta's decision to leave Polly in his care. In college, he reprised this stunt: Living in the same residence hall as his cousin, he beguiled his cousin's dog to sneak out of his master's rooms at night to sleep under Charles's blankets - at his feet, where else? This deep connection with nonhuman animals - and all nature - is a trait Edward Wilson today calls biophilia, a trait that people have more or less or none of. It runs in families, like other traits. Although Charles's kinship with animals surpassed that of various family mem- bers, others did have it. His brother, Erasmus Darwin, who socialized with the cultural titan Thomas Carlyle, was admired by Carlyle's wife for his way with dogs. And a Darwin cousin, Francis Sacheverel Darwin, wrote a book called Gamekeeper's Manual that was praised by Charles's son for "keen observation of the habits of various animals."</page><page sequence="3">370 / Southwest Review Charles, however, was the one who could win the loyalty of even a misanthropic dog. An odd counterpoint to all this is a confession early in Darwin's autobiography. Once as a very little boy... I acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from enjoying the sense of power,- but the beating could not have been severe, for the puppy did not howl, of which I feel sure, as the spot was near the house. This act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown by my remembering the exact spot where the crime was committed. It probably lay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a long time afterwards, a passion. The child's temptation to cruelty may be common, but succumbing to a lifelong guilt over it must be less so. Throughout his life, among his family, neighbors, fellow travelers, and scientific colleagues, Darwin was known for his compassion for horses and dogs. Modern Darwin scholars have pointed to a mad-scientist streak in his suspicions that plants have brains and in his awe at the intelligence of earthworms. They have clucked too at the anthropomorphism of his writing and thought - a trait verboten to the typical scientist. These sister quali- ties ensue from his biophilia, which he must have first felt as a child who loved dogs. The biophilia perhaps caged up in his memory the errant "sense of power." It certainly must have exacted this confes- sion in a document Darwin first drafted as a private history for his descendents. Darwin's communion with dogs deepened in his teens. He learned to hunt, passionately and well, and to deploy dogs in time-honored ways. The hunting season of the English leisure class was the glory of many years for Darwin, until his father, annoyed with his lackadaisi- cal college career, was provoked to accuse: "You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, &amp; rat-catching, 8k you will be a disgrace to yourself 8k all your family" - surely a classic among mistaken forecasts. Those testosterone days pricked Darwin's conscience, as he mused about them in his autobiography: "I think I must have been ashamed of my zeal for I tried to persuade myself that shooting was almost an intellectual enjoyment: it required so much skill to judge where to find most game and hunt the dogs well." Darwin soon ceased senseless</page><page sequence="4">H ar el / 371 killing for sport, and in later decades, as in the incident of the puppy, he felt guilt at inflicting suffering. But however benighted the pursuit, hunting gave him more intimacy with the ways and wiles of animals. His excuse did, then, contain a grain of truth. And however attenuated the English hunt was qua hunt, Darwin acquired enough outdoorsmanship to hold his own among men for whom hunting was tantamount to survival. When he traveled the world as the naturalist on a mapping expedition funded by the British government, such men guided him in the rough and un-English wilder- nesses. Dogs trekked along with Darwin throughout South America as he and his Gaucho companions threaded through jungles, galloped across plains, and slogged up and down mountain and ravine. He was always on the lookout for dogs: As he made his landings and found his species throughout the five-year voyage, many of his field notes contemplate the presence and absence and character of dogs. Darwin's outdoorsy skills no doubt aided a bond with the guides he employed, as seen in Voyage of the Beagle. (Darwin had nothing to do with the naming of the ship, though he delighted in joking that it was in fact a dog.) Darwin described the Gauchos' use of the lasso and its cousin, the bolas, a thong weighted with balls at its ends. Thrown in a whirl at prey, the bolas wrap around it in a stranglehold. Darwin detailed his own buffoonery in learning to wield this tool. The main difficulty ... is to ride so well, as to be able at full speed, and while suddenly turning about, to whirl them so steadily round the head, as to take aim: on foot any person would soon learn the art. One day, as I was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the balls round my head, by accident the free one struck a bush; and its revolving motion being thus destroyed, it immediately fell to the ground, and like magic caught one hind leg of my horse,- the other ball was then jerked out of my hand, and the horse fairly secured. Luckily he was an old practised animal, and knew what it meant; otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself down. The Gauchos roared with laughter; they cried they had seen every sort of animal caught, but had never before seen a man caught by himself. Obviously he risked and reaped the ridicule of his employees. But Darwin was an easy-going type, never self-important, and likely effaced</page><page sequence="5">372 / Southwest Review his being the employer. More to the point, he was, I think, confident of their respect. As he journeyed and bivouacked with these men, they must have remarked his savvy in the primal arts: his sense of horses, command of dogs, sharp marksmanship, and willingness to dine on the day's quarry - be it puma or ostrich eggs. These must have counterbal- anced the klutziness of the rube, his malodorous colonial origins, and his congeries of outlandish tools and scientific protocols as he collected his thousands of specimens of flora and fauna, fossil and rock. There is a lovely sociological irony in Darwin's being belittled as a dilettante in his own culture for practicing arts essential in another - and essential also to his work as a naturalist. That is three cultures clashing at one nexus. The story also highlights an often elusive side of Darwin: We are wont to think of scientists as nerds and Darwin as a sickly recluse, but back in the day he was one macho jock. Dog Manners and Morality Darwin's return to England was followed by a few dogless years. We may never know for sure, but this lack may explain why, as Darwin began to jot down the pros versus the cons of marrying Emma, among the pros was "better than a dog anyhow." Decades later, Darwin men- tioned in a book that among the Turuma Indians, men paid the same price for brides and good dogs, and we can only believe, based on this churlish remark, that Darwin would buy the wife before the dog. It seems, however, it would have been a close call. Still, Darwin listed other pro reasons, more generic and more romantic, and ended by proving marriage logical, even scrawling "Q.E.D." below the dueling columns, a nineteenth-century Dr. Spöck. Meanwhile, Emma's reasons for accepting her cousin included that he was "humane to animals," as if she knew they were never far from his humanity. Emma's appreciation of this key aspect of his character boded well for their union. Thus, during the forty-three years of an astonishingly devoted marriage, their household was home to at least five dogs. Over the course of those decades, Darwin reduced his traveling, becoming a stay-at-home country squire, a venerable bump on a log. He did take walks almost daily, to think and exercise, usually with a</page><page sequence="6">Harel /373 dog. For years, this was the surly Bob, intractable to all other humans but fanatical about his outings with Darwin. Then, as Darwin aged, the sprite Polly monitored him on his walks, sometimes braving a pelting rain for his sake. In those years, too, Darwin was neighborly with his neighbors, exchanging cordial letters swapping adorable-bad-dog stories for ex- ample. Here is Darwin replying to the local vicar: "Thanks for the very curious story about the dog &amp; mutton chops. They are wonderful animals, &amp; deserve to be loved with all one's heart, even when they do steal mutton chops." Indeed, his reputation for concern with animals was common cur- rency in the neighborhood, Francis recounted, telling of a visitor en route to their home who told his cab driver to go faster. The driver chastised the visitor: "'Why/ said the man, 'if I had whipped the horse this much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would have got out of the carriage and abused me well.'" Francis and many others knew of Darwin that "The two subjects which moved my Father perhaps more strongly than any others were cruelty to animals and slavery." But these two phenomena have one origin - a rampant "sense of power" that Darwin had managed to lock away safely in himself. Britain's national debate about research on animals provoked him to step into the limelight in 1875. This was the very same Darwin who ducked the worldwide brouhaha over evolution; who let other scientists - such as Thomas Huxley, a friend who nicknamed himself "Darwin's bulldog" (no comment) - duke it out with the public and the clergy,- who exulted in his autobiography, "I rejoice that I have avoided controversies," as he had been advised to do by Sir Charles Lyell, who had been beleaguered for his research on the age of the Earth. Though Darwin himself did not conduct the type of research at issue, he drafted a bill that earned informal approval among eminent scientists, and he lobbied for it in various corners of government and society. At a frail sixty-six years of age, Darwin even traveled to London to testify before a Royal Commission examining the issue. Darwin offered a nuanced view unappreciated by both sides, one of which could disregard the pain of animals as a phenomenon off the moral scale, while the other could not tolerate a cat in a cage. Displeas- ing the first side, he did not condone painful experiments for sheer curiosity, and felt that causing animals to suffer wronged life. The hu-</page><page sequence="7">374 / Southwest Review man animal should never inflict "useless" pain on any other organic being, he felt. He wrote to Henrietta, "I would gladly punish severely any one who operated on an animal not rendered insensible." Displeasing those who would forbid any animal research - whose ranks included Henrietta for a time - Darwin believed that it was essential for understanding human disease and developing cures. He perceived that many diseases cross species, and he argued that animal research also benefited animals. Several months after the letter to Henrietta, he wrote to a colleague that his goal was "to protect ani- mals, and at the same time not to injure Physiology." Darwin held this complex balance. In April 1881, a year before his death, he published a letter in several venues deploring "useless suffering" in animals and proselytizing for their use in research. "I know that physiology cannot possibly progress except by means of experiments on living animals, and I feel the deepest conviction that he who retards the progress of physiology commits a crime against mankind," he wrote. It's All Relative But a contradiction lurks between the pragmatic scientist and biophile humanist, and it is located in the world useless. If Darwin loved animals so well, why allow any experiments on animals, or why not be vegetarian? He guessed, for example, that the Hindu might ban animal research out of spiritual respect for life: "I can understand a Hindoo, who would object to an animal being slaughtered for food, disapproving of such experiments, but it is absolutely unintelligible to me on what ground the objection is made in this country," he told the government panel. To Henrietta, he groused that the pastimes of "the gentlemen of England . . . entail a hundred or a thousand-fold more suffering than the experiments of physiologists," which also shows his disavowal of his past with the hounds. Darwin's ideas about the utilitarian "struggle for existence," I think, encompass animal research and a carnivorous diet. Both enact "nature red in tooth and claw," survival of the fittest. The logic seems to be: The nonhuman animal eats other animals to survive, so why should the human be any different? And why is conquering disease any less an imperative of survival than an iron-and-protein-rich dinner? For</page><page sequence="8">Harel /37$ Darwin, maybe the naked ape is no different from its less complex relatives in instinctively placing a premium on survival, even killing for it. That is how profound our kinship is. That Darwin acquiesced to this law of the jungle at least once may be seen in one of the most shocking passages in his oeuvre: Savages often suffer from famines, and are sometimes expelled by war from their own homes. In such cases it can hardly be doubted that they would save their most useful animals. When the Fuegians are hard pressed by want, they kill their old women for food rather than their dogs; for, as we were assured, "old women no use - dogs catch otters." The same sound sense would surely lead them to preserve their more useful dogs when still harder pressed by famine. Mr. Oldfield, who has seen so much of the aborigines of Australia, informs me that "they are all very glad to get a Eu- ropean kangaroo dog, and several instances have been known of the father killing his own infant that the mother might suckle the much-prized puppy." Is it "sound sense" to commit matricide and infanticide? To kill the helpless is the very antithesis of rational compassion. But here, in extremis, compassion for the weak individual may be counter to the survival of the group. The "sound sense" of these practices, it seems, is in their survival value, like the carnivorous diet. Red meat and human triage and animal research, it seems, are "useful" in Darwin's view, acceptable because they contribute to survival. Varying the amount of gruesome detail, Darwin told this compelling tale three times - in The Origin , Variation, and the Journal of Researches. And he was not a man who liked to repeat himself. Darwin usually cringed at what he saw as the Fuegians' brutal ways, but here where the "savage" gives no sanctity to the individual life, neither does he. It is thus not a typical moment for Darwin, who maintained that our most refined morality developed from the parental love of simpler animals. Darwin felt for the women, writing in his obscure Journal of Researches : Horrid as such a death by the hands of their friends and relatives must be, the fears of the old women, when hunger begins to press, are more painful to think of; we were told that they then often run</page><page sequence="9">376 / Southwest Review away in the mountains, but that they are pursued by the men and brought back to the slaughter-house at their own fire-sides! Darwin sees the human suffering - with no misogynistic view that a woman's life or pain is trivial - in this brutal and bizarre moment. Still, the group's sacrifice of baby and grandmother to survival makes evolutionary "sense" to him. He accepts the brutal side of nature, including, of course, human nature. Indeed, the very evolutionary theory that posits the brutality of the survival of the fittest also posits the altruism of "mutual aid." Animal research clearly had and has medical benefits for many species, and for Darwin to see its sense is no more than to see that the brutal and the altruistic may co-exist in one act as in one theory. But the question remains: What is so vital that it is worth our inflicting suffering on "our brethren" as Darwin once called nonhu- man animals? What does he see as more important? Homo sapiens ? Darwin was never one to rank Homo sapiens above other life forms, to see animals as servants that our species has the right to abuse. Quite the contrary. Again and again, in books and letters, he complained of "Man's" chutzpah in elevating Himself above other species, his hubris as seeing Himself as better, God-like. He castigated those who would on the basis of such indefinite terms as the soul, "place Man in his own order of reception," a phrase he borrowed from Huxley. Darwin tried to purge his thought of the concept of "higher" and "lower" regarding species, substituting phrases like "less-complex," leveling differences between plant and animal, amoeba and us, with his trademark democratic terms, living creature and organic being. Later in life, he changed organic being to organized being, which somehow gives the referent beings more clout. Darwin was not a man to be cavalier about taking the life of even an earthworm, let alone a mammal endowed with thought and a loving family. Is knowledge, then, as imperative as survival, worth the sacrifice of life and compassion? Perhaps it is no wonder that a man who can accept one group's sacrifice of a baby or grandmother to survival can also accept another group's sacrifice of an animal to knowledge. But to pit knowledge against suffering is to start down a most slippery slope. Even Darwin struggled in this ominous place. Darwin revered knowledge, as most scientists do, and abhorred suffering, as most</page><page sequence="10">Harel /377 humans do. His policy prefigures today's ethos, which allows animal research while ensuring maximum utility, minimal suffering, and scrupulous fidelity to the ideal of palliating all suffering. This tries to reconcile imperatives, strives for the greatest good. Darwin wished to be as kind as he could be, as good-hearted as a good dog. What the Dog Had to Say Darwin emulated the dog in his benchwork. Sheer "dogged- ness" spurred decades of experimentation in his homemade labs and hothouses, according to his son. Darwin had his own ways of work- ing - with scrupulous records, nimble fingers, skinflint efficiencies, a zest for the morning's news from his bench. The engine for Darwin's experimental productivity was, Francis wrote, his power of sticking to a subject; he used almost to apologise for his patience, saying that he could not bear to be beaten, as if this were rather a sign of weakness on his part. He often quoted the saying, 'It's dogged as does it/ and I think doggedness expresses his frame of mind almost better than perseverance. Perseverance seems hardly to express his almost fierce desire to force the truth to reveal itself. Not unlike a pointer's fierce desire to reveal a bird, or the herding dog's fierce desire to force the coyotes away. Experimentation was Darwin's instinct for hunting bioculturally transformed. Darwin knew his own doggedness. In his granddaughter's edition of his autobiography, he writes of how his older sister, assigned to tutor him, chastised him so much that he had to "make myself dogged so as not to care." In academia today, it is a truism that even the scientist's percep- tions are, willy-nilly, influenced by the ideas he or she holds. So, for example, the Darwin scholar Dov Ospovat has written: Even when Darwin was in his closest contact with nature, as on the voyage and during his research on barnacles, his interaction with nature was mediated by assumptions and ways of perceiving nature that he derived from other naturalists . . . and from the culture in which he was educated and carried out his work.</page><page sequence="11">378 / Southwest Review This is less true than it seems. Because his intimacy with barnacles notwithstanding, Darwin's closest contact with nature was perforce when he was a child, when theory had no toehold in his mind, when logic would not dare restrain imagination, when the puppy love for life begins, and no a priori assumptions or well-thought-out philosophies "mediate" sensation, perception, emotion, or reaction. Nor could cul- ture have determined a love for the nonhuman organic being. Attitudes toward dogs within his culture were so diverse that a child might pick and choose which to "derive," which instincts to ignore and which to heed: the drive for power that can lead to cruelty? the fear of other that can lead to phobias about the four-legged? biophilia? Darwin derived from the dog his first sense of the "one living spirit" that courses through all life forms. In the love of the dog, Darwin first felt our common animal heart. And that heart - as much as any fossil or fact - spoke volumes in his ears. Polly did right to die in his honor.</page></plain_text>
