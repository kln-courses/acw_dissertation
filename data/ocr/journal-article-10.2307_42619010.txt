Though not professedly commentaries, and without any bibliogra- phical apparatus, these volumes present in meaty preface and succinct footnotes the most up-to-date and reliable answers to many exegetical problems rising out of the sacred text. The price of the volumes, high by accepted standards, is reflected in the exquisite paper and typography. 1. Père de Vaux begins with a " General Introduction to the Pen- tateuch ". A reaction against Weyhausen is seen to have dominated these past twenty years, and now " traditions " are judged of more im- portance than " books ", on s'oriente certainement vers une conception moins livresque, plus proche des réalités vivantes. Readers will doubtless assume that the " reaction against Wellhausen " means a rejection of the J K P D documents; but de Vaux refers rather to the normative cha- racter of the living oral transmission of the text or saga (Nyberg-Kn- GNEljtf). Doublets and inconsistencies are a valid proof, not of material documents, but of " traditions " J, K, and P (D forming a class apart), legitimating Quellenscheidung even in the middle of a verse (2, 4; 35, 22). J and E are variants of the same account, which goes back to the time when Israel was constituted a people and dominated by the figure of Moses. Any J text will never be fully understood except in the light of other J texts, " situated in the development of this tradition and inter- preted in function of its tendencies and its doctrine " as the notes will specify; though in the unity of its ultimate redaction the book has also a general sense, and as such is the foundation of the Jewish phase of the revealed religion: sc. the choice of Israel, by promises and alliances. The religion of the Patriarchs consisted in this: Yahweh turned to himself by a theophany such sanctuaries as Bethel, Sichern, Mambre, Beersheba, where other divinities were probably honored previously (p. 33). Abraham is dated 1850 B. C. and Joseph 1700. Between Gen 1-11 and paleontology there exists no nexus whatever, only " either an</page><page sequence="2">94 Iya Sainte Bible traduite en français unreal opposition or an artificial agreement " (p. 35). The sacerdotal account of creation is traced according to scientific notions as yet em- bryonic; " all effort at concordism with our knowledge today must be renounced, reading in the text its eternal lesson ' ' (p. 39) ; perhaps it is too little to say that the only impression derived from comparison with ancient oriental cosmogonies is ¡the transcendence of the Bible. The Garden of Eden, though described as a desert-oasis, is localized if anywhere near the sources of Tigris and Euphrates in the mountains of Armenia. The Age of the Patriarchs was calculated, according to de Vaux (p. 53d), on the assumption that human longevity diminished progres- sively in successive epochs; it would be interesting to note here with Breuii, that of the 157 earliest humans known to science, only half reach- ed the age of 20 and three 50. The deluge-story, woven of a yahwistic and a priestly narrative, " does not depend upon any one of the Baby- lonian accounts but draws from the same source as they: the remembrance of one or several disastrous inundations of the Tigris-Euphrates valley, which the tradition had magnified to the dimensions of a universal ca- taclysm " (p. 57b). The curse of Canaan, rather than Ham (9, 22), seems to reflect the historical situation at the time of Abraham when Canaan was inundated by a new Semitic invasion, accompanied by some (Japhetite) elements from Asia Minor. In P, Canaan is attached to Ham ( = Africa: Egypt, Ethiopia, Arabia) because of the Egyptian domina- tion there; whereas in J the Babylonians are Hamites and the South- Arabians Semites. Gn 10, 14 makes the Philistines sons of Egypt. The name Hittites 23, 3 is used in a wide sense for some non-Semitic (Hur- rian?) group; there never was a Hittite population in Palestine. In chapter 27 is denied the distinction of two sources, Jacob deceived in J by the smell of Esau's clothes but in E by the touch of shaggy skin; these traits are complementary, and the art is too skilful to reflect such a melange; certain details may be redactional. Both the shepherd Jacob and the hunter Esau are termed " agriculturalist ". Ephrata of Rachel's tomb 35, 16 is more probably in Benjamin (= Rama!); Joseph's coat of many colors is rendered " long-sleeved tunic (en tout cas, un vêtement princier) ". The " blessings " or rather oracles of Jacob do not come from J, E, P, or D, but were composed in part before the kingship of David and edited definitively in his time; ftlius accrescens Joseph.... filiae discurrerunt 49, 18 becomes " un plant fécond [or, jeune taureau] près de la source, dont les tiges franchissent le mur [or, ses pas se dirigent vers une fontaine]. " In general the notes give expression to a ma- gisterial erudition, eclectic but concise and always colorful. 2. Père Couroyer admits the four traditions in Ex, but the divi- sion of the text among them is more difficult than in Gen; the notes will only indicate sous toute réserve the attributions (which have been or are commonly) proposed. The date of the Exodus is probably under Ramses II after 1250; data of archaeology are justly recognized as fra- gile regarding Jericho but are considered conclusive regarding the distinct- ive occupation of Transjordan and Palestine about 1200. Solidly probable are the localizations: Ramses at Qantir [which Alt in Zucker- Festschrift</page><page sequence="3">La Sainte Bible traduite en français 95 (Berlin 1954) 7 plausibly suggests as palace-area (20 km S) of Tanis]; yam suf is connected with pa-sufi, an Egyptian post between Tanis and el-Qantara near Lake Menzaleh, though the actual crossing took place at the south of the Bitter Lakes then part of the Suez Gulf; Mount Sinai is Jebl Musa. Not merely Exodus and Hammurabi but also the Hittite, Assyrian, and Lipit-Ištar code similarities derive from a homogeneous social and juridical atmosphere, from a droit coutumier which had become partially a common possession of the Ancient Near East. Ex 3, 14 is rendered "Je suis celui qui je suis ", Yah weh admits four possible ety- mologies, " he breathes, destroys, fells, speaks " [omitted is the possibi- lity, " he causes to be or is "I am he who is " represents a kind of preliminary metaphysicis; but allowance is made also for the variant " I am that which (or he who) I am ", i.e. that is my secret. Ex 4, 16, of vital importance for the biblical notion of prophetic inspiration, " he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God ", is rendered " as if he were thy mouth and as if thou wert the god who inspires him It is preferable never to employ the terms reve- lation or inspiration in rendering an Old Testament expression because this inevitably takes issue on exceedingly complex theological problems for which the Old Testament has no technical term but only concrete and anthropomorphic descriptions. One would regret] to see " I have upheld you on wings of eagles " 19, 4 replaced by " vulture- wings " (explained Dt 14, 12: there is question of a carrion-eating bird). Only two of the variant verse-divisions of the Decalogue 20, 1 are mentioned; that of Philo- Josephus-Greeks- Protestants is declared " more natural ". 3. A sane framework of discoveries in the history of religions serves M. Cazelles for incorporating his views on the composition of Leviticus, not neglecting its relationships with the Mass (intimate) and the liturgy (remote). The laws of sacrifice 1-7 are a summary of all the phases of worship which influenced the Hebrew race: the animal- worship of cave- dwellers, the flock-sacrifice of nomads, the cereal offering of farmers, the Foi of Abraham and the Loi of Moses. The priesthood is seen to be organized by David, though Leviticus would imply that it goes back beyond him to Moses (ce n'est pas à David que le Lévitique entend faire remonter le sacerdoce yahviste, mais à Moïse, p. 9); virtually here the translator acknowledges a considerably post-Da vidic date for his text; on p. 15 his view is that there are several different strata of composition implied in the book, but that " il n'y a pas encore à ces problèmes litté- raires une solution qui ait rallié tous les suffrages Since the post- Ezechiel compilers are " conservative spirits, more intent on preserving the pre-exilic way than on reforming it " (Lods), c'est vraiment de l'esprit mosaïque que procède leur œuvre (p. 18). Just stress is placed on the charité fraternelle profonde et exigeante of Lev 19, 18. A sound psycholo- gical analysis makes priesthood flow from the instinct of sacrifice, and from cultic priesthood flows the notion of the organ of manifesting God's will to men and thus uniting them to him. The notes are very rich and suggestive, though one senses that they are scarcely interested in sources other than Assyrian or Egyptian. We must indeed see Israel in its Old</page><page sequence="4">96 La Sainte Bible traduite en français Testament backgrounds so as not to impose later concepts upon the sacred text, warns Anderson, Hebrew Religion 285; but " it is possible to be so engrossed in the background that it becomes foreground . . . to use the non-Israelite evidence as the basis of our reconstruction, and then to fit the Israelite evidence. . . into the structure ". 4. Numbers, also rarissime in liturgy, is a powerful doctrinal syn- thesis: the community is directed by God but through human authorities and in constant interaction with a human environment. The power of priest and ruler united in Moses is divided with Josue, who must seek from the Aaronic priesthood Yahweh's will through the Urim. This doctrine is due chiefly to the ultimate Esdran or at least post-Ezechiel redactor, who chose the desert- Wändering cadre to interpolate most of those late laws which are more obviously post-Sin aitic; but he conserves many of the ancient prose and verse texts of even pre-Mosaic origin. The reader of Cazelles ' pages is ever conscious of being in contact with a superior quality of exegesis; among the many details which arrest at- tention, some inevitably will invite query. ' ' Speculations ' ' on the num- ber of persons in the Exodus Nm 1, 46, might perhaps have been replaced by two or three concise probable opinions (including the data of Nm 3, 43; 4, 48) with the translator's conclusion as to the likeliest actual number. We would have welcomed some hint of why the " lamentation mauvaise " 11, 1 is the mourning-rite for a vegetation-god (cf. Ez 8, 14) instead of the usual discontented murmurs. Moses' Cushite wife 12, 1 is not an Ethiopian but a Midianite Sipporah of Ex 2, 21; Egyptian texts and Hab 3, 7 call a bedouin (Midianite) tribe Cushite. The list of Nm 13 is different [later] than Nm 1; many of its names were used by contempo- raries of David. Hebron 13, 22 was founded 7 years before Tanis, and Tanis about 1730 B. C., both during the Hyksos invasion of Egypt: an exceedingly useful precision. " I, a mer de Sûph " 14, 25 is not an im- provement on " Red Sea "; better " Reed Sea Schilfmeer ; in 21, 4 " Mer des Roseaux [traduit Sûf] " is not the Suf of the Exodus, but the Sûf of 21, 14 (near Arnon) and Dt 1,1 (in the region of Edom). 5. The preponderant part which Cazelles assigns to Moses in Dt consists in his having legislated the basic principles and arranged for them to be applied by the Invites as guardians of his spirit and his law. It is chiefly these later " decisions " (plus some " laws and customs " already expanded by Moses p. 34b) which constitute the bulk of Dt: much relative to the centralization of cult must be linked with Josias and Jeremias, but chapters 1-4, 28, and 31-32 prove a second redaction under the influence of the Exile and the Second Part of Isaias, and in- fluencing in turn the redaction of Kings. In Dt 33, 8 we encounter the plural article les Ourim; tes Our im, tes Toummim; as also in Abel's Maccabées 305 des Ourim et Toumim; unaccountably the common French rOurim et le Toummim is retained in Ex 28, 30; Lev 8, 8; Nm 27, 21 and p. 10. For a general evaluation of Cazelles' position one may refer further to his own article in Biblica 35 (1954) 279-298. 6. Abel's Josué is not altogether in the tradition above outlined; the notes are much scaintier and could not really be said to touch all urgent</page><page sequence="5">A. Bruno, Jesaja - Genesis- Exodus 97 problems of the text; the version also seems businesslike rather than li- terary in language: " Yah vé avait en effet decreté. . . Bref, Josué s'empara de tout le pays, exactement selon les insti uctions " 12, 20-23; " C'est par inquiétude et pour le motif suivant que nous avons agi " 22, 24. The marvels of Josué are a supplementary ornament (viendra-t-il décorer) to the passage of the Jordan, imitating the narrative of the Red Sea passage p. 10; cf. p. 12, schematic and edifying artistry (adding?) details to brl'ng out the "spiritual sense". Despite the (anticipated?) Deutero- nomic monopoly of cultus, Yahweh is a mountain-God; the altar on Ebal (or Garizim) continues the patriarchal worship of Sichern, Hebron, Beer- sheba. The localization of Bethabara and Gilgal at the same point is connected with the (Origen, Theodoret) mystic interpretation of Josue and the Passage as a figure of Jesus and his Baptism. The Canaanites expelled in 3, 10 fled to Africa; Procopius of Caesarea claims to have seen at Tangiers a -stela bearing in Phoenician the inscription " we are those who fled before the face dì the brigand Josue son of Navé Abel laudably retains the now international term tell both for the curse of Hai, " un tell éternel, une ruine jusqu'à aujourd'hui " 8, 28, and for the towns of Ga- lilee " qui restaient debout sur leurs tells " 11, 13 with the note " This notion of the tell, found also in Jer 30, 18, is altogether Palestinian Serious consideration is given to the view that Baalbek, generally held to be at earliest slightly pre- Roman, may be Baal-gad of 12, 7; 13, 5. The map of the tribes, p. 64, without any place names is attractively clear but not very informative; Dan is assigned to the Jaffa seacoast (19, 46 le Yarqon et Raqqon avec le territoire en face de Yapho); but no coastline is allotted to Zàbulon, though Gn 49 and Dt 33 are invoked to complete these geographical details (p. 70b). The series as a whole will undoubtedly be of great influence in modern exegesis. R. North</page></plain_text>
