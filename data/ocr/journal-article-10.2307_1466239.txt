<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion 66/1 A f ARTICLES Explanatory Pluralism William H. Austin SUPPOSE TWO PEOPLE, working from within different theoretical frameworks, offer explanations of the same phenomenon (event or state of affairs). What can we say about the relation between the two explana- tions? Are they rivals, so that at least one must be wrong while the other might be correct and even complete? Or could both stand as "partial" ex- planations, at least compatible and perhaps capable of being somehow combined into a "fuller" explanatory story? Suppose further that the phe- nomenon in question is a "religious" one and that one of the explanations is "religious" while the other is "naturalistic." Would that alter the range of viable answers to the above questions? An exchange in the pages of this journal between Wayne Proudfoot and G. William Barnard (Proudfoot 1993; Barnard 1993) provides a good starting point for reflection on these questions. Proudfoot had argued in his book Religious Experience that naturalistic explanations of religious phenomena are perfectly legitimate and in order, attacking as "protective stratagems" various influential arguments to the effect that such explana- tions must fail. Barnard read him as saying that only naturalistic explana- tions are in order and countered with "a sustained plea for the necessity of a plurality of approaches to the study of religious phenomena" (Bar- nard 1992:253), including some that are not naturalistic. Proudfoot re- plied that his book endorsed and exemplified explanatory pluralism, while allowing (1993:802) that he himself sees no need "to appeal to any cause beyond the natural order." Unsurprisingly, Barnard is not satisfied with such circumscribed pluralism. "My quarrel is not with Proudfoot's William H. Austin is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204. 13</page><page sequence="2">14 Journal of the American Academy of Religion attempts to formulate any number of naturalistic hypotheses for religious experience. What I have difficulty accepting is his tendency to turn rea- sonable hypotheses into conclusive, authoritative explanations" (Barnard 1993: 810). So it appears that both authors are for pluralism, differing only as to its scope. It isn't so clear that Barnard would endorse explanatory plural- ism, i.e., the view that (sometimes at least) the best account of a phenome- non will include several partial explanations. He seems leery of the idea of explaining religious (or any other?) phenomena at all. The contrast he draws between "reasonable hypotheses" and "conclusive authoritative explanations" suggests that to him the phrase "partial explanation" would be an oxymoron: to claim to give an explanation is ipso facto to claim completeness and finality. Proudfoot plainly does not mean to claim so much when he speaks of explaining things. So one way in which he and Barnard are at cross-purposes is that they use the term "explanation" dif- ferently. We will be in a position later (Section 4 below) to say a little more about the nature of this difference in usage. In this paper I will be using the term in Proudfoot's way, which seems to me more usual. My aim in this paper is to explore the logic of the ideas of partial explanation and explanatory pluralism with the help of analytic tools developed in the course of the extensive discussion of explanation by philosophers of science in the last half-century. In the first of the follow- ing sections I will introduce some of the more basic of these tools and use them to formulate and to resolve a prima facie difficulty in Proudfoot's argument, which if not resolved would seem to render the whole discus- sion moot. What it means to say that an explanation is partial, how there can be several correct explanations of the same phenomenon, and how these explanations might be related to one another are the questions taken up in Section 2. The proposed answers are there illustrated with everyday and scientific, not religious, examples. I try in Section 3 to show how the analytic machinery just developed can be used to clarify the relations between different naturalistic explana- tions of religious phenomena. It would be nice to be able to show in what ways Freud's and Durkheim's theories, say, really conflict and in what ways they are complementary. I cannot undertake anything so grand (certainly not within the scope of this paper). Instead I offer, as a case study, an analysis of two apparently conflicting explanations of the biblical ban on pork, viz., those offered by anthropologists Mary Douglas and Marvin Harris. What a "religious explanation" might be, and whether religious expla- nations can be related to naturalistic ones in the same sorts of ways that</page><page sequence="3">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 15 naturalistic ones can be related to one another, are the topics of Section 4. A promising idea of Bas van Fraassen's is introduced-with the caution that a lot of work will be needed before we can tell how helpful it will be. The exchange between Proudfoot and Barnard was titled "Explaining the Unexplainable." This was also the main title of Barnard's earlier paper. In a brief Epilogue I explore ways of making sense of that paradoxical expression. 1. REDUCTION: DESCRIPTIVE VERSUS EXPLANATORY Anti-reductionists say that naturalistic accounts of religious phenom- ena necessarily fail to capture the phenomenon they purport to explain. Proudfoot counters with a distinction between descriptive reduction and explanatory reduction. The former is "the failure to identify an emotion, practice, or experience under the description by which the subject identi- fies it" (1985: 196). Explanatory reduction "consists in offering an expla- nation in terms that are not those of the subject and that might not meet with his approval" (197). Anti-reductionists are right, Proudfoot says, in holding that descriptive reduction is unacceptable. But they are wrong in thinking that explanatory reduction is likewise tainted. You can have one without the other. But can you? On the familiar analysis of explanation offered by Carl Hempel, it would seem that explanatory reduction would necessarily in- volve descriptive reduction. According to Hempel, the basic structure of an explanation is that of an argument, in which a statement (the expla- nandum) describing the phenomenon to be explained is derived (deduc- tively or with high inductive probability) from another set of statements (the explanans). But it will not be possible to carry out the derivation if there are terms in the explanandum that do not appear in the explanans. So before we can carry out the derivation we must redescribe, in the vo- cabulary of the explanans, the phenomenon to be explained. This redes- cription would seem to be a case of descriptive reduction after all. I have laid out the argument with reference to Hempel's well-known account of explanation, but analogous arguments would hold for any analyses in which an explanation is taken to consist in placing a descrip- tion of the phenomenon in a wider linguistic context. The problem is heightened by Proudfoot's insistence, throughout his book, that the con- cepts in which an experience is characterized are "constitutive of" the experience. If so, it would seem that in attempting to redescribe the ex- perience one must end up describing some other experience (actual or possible). Nevertheless, I do not think the problem is as great as it initially seems, though it does require the statement of some conditions that a</page><page sequence="4">16 Journal of the American Academy of Religion reductive explanation must meet if it is to be satisfactory, and these condi- tions may not always be easy to meet. Plainly enough, if the reductive explanation is to be sustained, the redescription it requires must be justified, i.e., we must be given grounds for assurance that it really is the same phenomenon that is being de- scribed. To see how the justification might be carried out, I will first con- sider a scenario elaborated from an example Proudfoot frequently uses. That scenario will suffice to show how the necessary redescription can sometimes be justified. But naturalistic redescriptions of religious experi- ences pose further problems and in considering them we will need to examine closely the "constitutive of" issue. To show both how reductive explanations can be acceptable and why descriptive reduction is not, Proudfoot frequently uses the example of a hiker who mistakes a log for a bear and is afraid. For my purposes, I will modify the example a bit. A hiker, Hank, and his friend, Fran, are back- packing along a mountain trail. Hank has gotten ahead and rounded a corner, when suddenly he comes pelting back down the trail, crying "Run! There's a bear up there!" Fran, unlike Hank, is familiar with the region and knows that up ahead there is an oddly-shaped boulder that from certain vantage points in certain lighting conditions is easily mistaken for a bear. The locals call it Bear Rock. (Perhaps Fran sent Hank ahead in anticipa- tion of his reaction.) How shall we describe Hank's experience? "I was afraid of a bear" is how Hank might well describe it. If he were asked for an explanation of the experience, that would be his explanandum, and his explanans would include the statement "There was a bear up there" as well as reasons for being afraid of bears. Fran's explanans would not include the statement that there was a bear there and would not be acceptable to Hank, who at this point is sure he saw a bear. So she is engaging in explanatory re- duction. But what is Fran's explanandum? It can't be simply the same as Hank's, because according to her there is no bear to be afraid of. It can't be "Hank was afraid of a boulder," because he doesn't fear boulders (unless perhaps they are perched precariously on ridges, as this one isn't; and anyway, he doesn't think he saw a boulder). It can't be merely "Hank was afraid," for while both would agree with that statement, it doesn't capture the specific quality of the experience. It would have to be something like "Hank was afraid of something that he took to be a bear but is actually a boulder." The reference to the bear is needed to avoid descriptive reduction; the ref- erence to the boulder is needed for the sake of the logical link with Fran's explanans. So the reductive explainer's redescription must include an appropriate reference to the "intentional object" mentioned in the subject's explanan-</page><page sequence="5">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 17 dum. The justification must include an explanation of why the subject- Hank, in our story-could be expected to have described the experience as he did. In this case it would include the boulder's resemblance to a bear and Hank's unfamiliarity with Bear Rock. We are inclined to accept Fran's explanation and the redescription it incorporates, because we can easily imagine Fran taking Hank to Bear Rock and his agreeing that that was what he saw. Even if circumstances prevent that (Hank is too shaken to go there right away, night is falling, and his plane leaves early the next morning), we can agree that Fran's explanation is legitimate and quite possibly correct. We can agree to that because we know of similar situations in which people who have had appropriate facts pointed out to them have come to accept explanations they initially rejected. But will this example sustain the weight Proudfoot puts on it? In the first place, is Fran's explanation really reductive? It is in the sense that Hank didn't initially accept it and might never accept it. But it is not so clear that the other clause in Proudfoot's definition, i.e., that the terms of the explanation "are not those of the subject," is satisfied. In our scenario Hank made no mention of boulders, but "boulder" is in his vocabulary, and reference to them is part of his explanatory repertoire-if he saw Fran running down the hill with a boulder bouncing after her, he could easily explain her fear and her flight. Suppose we agree that Fran's explanation does count as a case of explanatory reduction. Then some explanatory reductions are legitimate. But is the analogy with naturalistic explanations of religious experiences close enough to warrant concluding that they (or at least some of them) are in order? There seem to be two marked disanalogies between the case of Fran's explanation of Hank's fear, on the one hand, and cases of natu- ralistic (e.g., Freudian or Durkheimian) explanations of religious experi- ences, on the other. For one thing, it is not easy in the latter cases to say exactly what would be the analogue of "going over the terrain together" and not easy to carry out that operation even if one does succeed in speci- fying what it would amount to. The other disanalogy is that in many instances crucial concepts in the naturalist's explanans will not figure in the explanatory repertoire of the person whose experience is being ex- plained. (Both difficulties would be particularly acute when it is distant historical figures whose experience is being explained.) Nevertheless, people do sometimes come to accept naturalistic expla- nations of experiences they had regarded (and in some cases continue to regard) as religious. This raises a severe difficulty for anyone who tries to press the disanalogies so far as to conclude that naturalistic explanations of religious experiences must always be out of order or mistaken. For this would entail that the people who have come to accept naturalistic expla-</page><page sequence="6">18 Journal of the American Academy of Religion nations of their own experiences have all been wrong-hardly a palatable consequence. Why should it be assumed that their first explanations must be better than their later ones? Thus,it seems wiser to take the disanalogies as pointing to difficulties that must be overcome, case by case, if particular naturalistic explanations are to be vindicated, not as proof that such vindication is impossible. Let us explore a little further the nature of the difficulties, since they are likely to loom large in any case where they are not "trumped" by the subject's acceptance of the explanation. We can start with Proudfoot's claim that the terms in which an experi- ence is described and explained are "constitutive of" the experience. There is an ambiguity in this expression. It could be taken in a relatively innocu- ous way, as meaning simply that the terms mark off the experience as being of a certain kind or falling into a certain class. Redescription would then amount to reclassification. Hank (in the scenario wherein he is taken to see Bear Rock and is convinced) comes to place his experience in the class "fear of something that appeared to be a bear" instead of the class "fear of a bear." The person who initially classifies her experience as "reli- gious" and then comes to accept a naturalistic explanation of it thereby puts it into another class instead or in addition. (If she thinks naturalistic and religious explanations are compatible, she will assign the experience to two distinct though overlapping classes.) No great problem here. But sometimes Proudfoot seems to have in mind a stronger sense of "constitutive," as when he argues that Buddhist and Catholic mystics have different experiences (1985: 120ff.). It won't do, he says, to hold that they have the same experience but interpret it differently. Their respective doctrinal schemes enter too intimately and pervasively into the fabric of the experience. Abstract from the doctrinal schemes, and there is no cog- nizable experience to be assigned to one (doctrinal-scheme-independent) class or another. Why not? Because an experience must be identified or referred to under a description, and the description will contain terms whose meaning is determined in part by the interrelated set of doctrinal propositions in which they also occur. This line of thought is strongly reminiscent of the extensive re- cent discussion among philosophers of science of the "theory-ladenness" of observation and the "incommensurability" of theoretical frameworks. Notoriously, T. S. Kuhn has argued that there can be no fully neutral ob- servations to adjudicate between theories or to give decisive reasons to prefer one over its rivals, because any observations must be identified and referred to under a description that will incorporate terms drawn from one or another of the theories. Equally notoriously, critics have charged that, on Kuhn's showing, theory choice is a thoroughly irrational business,</page><page sequence="7">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 19 and they have dismissed Kuhn's qualifications (partial communication, no fully neutral observations, meanings determined in part) as having no grounding in his theoretical apparatus. At this point Philip Kitcher, a philosopher of science more sympathetic to Kuhn than many in the guild, has a helpful suggestion. Kitcher points out (77f., 101-105) that for each term used in a scientific community and for each member of the community (including pro- ponents of rival theories) there will be a variety of ways of using that term to refer to things. In Kitcher's terminology, these "modes of reference" together provide the "reference potential" of the term, and it is the hetero- geneity of the reference potential that allows for successful communica- tion and rational persuasion across theoretical divides. The "descriptive mode of reference," in which the speaker's intention is to refer to some- thing that behaves in accord with the principles of a given theory, is not the only mode of reference. If it were, Lavoisier speaking of "oxygen" could not have been referring to the same substance that Priestley spoke of as "dephlogisticated air." The references of these terms would be fixed by their roles within incompatible theories. But both Priestley and Lavoisier can and do use their respectively favored terms to refer to what they can also agree in describing as "the substance that is emitted when the red calx of mercury is heated," for example. That is why they are not locked within their respective theoretical schemes, doomed to talk past one another. None of this challenges the point that phenomena are always iden- tified or referred to "under a description." Kitcher reserves the term "de- scriptive mode of reference" for cases of one particular type of descrip- tion, and that may be an unfortunate terminological choice. But the point is that a phenomenon can be identified under several descriptions, not all of them involved with controverted theories, and each identifier will recognize that it is the same phenomenon under each of his or her own descriptions. Proponents of rival theories can successfully commu- nicate, then, and argue rationally, so long as there is at least one descrip- tion under which both refer to the phenomenon at issue-as there usually will be. Thus, if anyone wants to argue for the incommensurability of reli- gious doctrinal schemes (or of religious with naturalistic explanatory frameworks) on the basis of an analogy with the alleged incommensura- bility of "paradigm" theories in science, a way to counter the argument is at hand. Redescriptions of phenomena can be justified, and there is noth- ing paradoxical about people coming to accept naturalistic explanations of their religious experiences, or about the Catholic mystic's converting to Buddhism and reinterpreting her experience accordingly. More exactly: if there is something paradoxical about such things, it must depend on</page><page sequence="8">20 Journal of the American Academy of Religion special features of religious experiences or religious doctrines, not on in- commensurabilities of diverse theoretical schemes in general. Perhaps enough ground has now been cleared so that we can pro- visionally assume the legitimacy of naturalistic explanations and turn to consideration of how explanations can be partial and plural. 2. PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS What does it mean to say that a phenomenon has been "partially" explained? Under what conditions can we combine partial explanations into complete or "less partial" ones? What would prevent such combin- ing? In this section I will introduce some analytical tools with which to tackle such questions and give examples of their use. Before I do that, let me briefly distinguish the sense of "partial expla- nation" I shall be exploring from another with which it might be con- fused. Sometimes when an answer is offered for a why-question, the questioner will respond with another why-question. ("Why X?" "Because Y." "OK, but why Y?") In some such cases the questioner might be willing to say that the original answer was a partial explanation of the phenome- non asked about. That is not what I mean by "partial explanation." As I shall be using the terms, "because Y" could be a complete explanation of X, even though we might then want to treat Y as another explanandum in its turn. The primary purpose of the analytic machinery I shall be introduc- ing is quite simple. A major source of confusion in discussions of the re- lations among explanations is unclarity as to exactly what it is that is being explained. Two people who ask "Why X?" may not be asking the same question, and two people who offer answers may not be answering the same question. Thus two explanations that initially seem to be either al- ternatives or incomplete might, in fact, be complete answers to different questions. Nonetheless, there is also a sense in which they could be re- garded as partial explanations of the same phenomenon. How so? We often speak of explaining events (e. g., the eruption of Mt. St. Helens), collections of related events (the demise of the dinosaurs), trends (the shift in the U.S. economy from manufacturing to service in- dustries), or standing conditions (the numerical preponderance of hydro- gen atoms in the universe). In each case the explanandum is identified by means of a noun phrase. This usage is standard, but it does pose a prob- lem for the would-be explainer. If I ask you to explain the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, you may well reply, "What is it about the eruption you are asking me to explain-its timing, its volume, .. .?" If the explanans is to be finite, the explanandum must be indicated by a sentence describing an aspect of, or stating a particular fact about, the event in question.</page><page sequence="9">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 21 The contrast between explananda-as-noun-phrases and explananda- as-sentences is Carl Hempel's way of drawing the needed distinction. Re- gardless of terminology the crucial thing is to recognize the difference between "explaining an event" and answering some specific why-question about it, i.e., explaining some particular aspect of or fact about the event. The former sort of explanation could never be complete; the latter could be. A complete answer to a specific why-question concerning a phenome- non could then count as a partial explanation of the phenomenon consid- ered as a concrete event, or standing condition, etc. I said that one could never completely "explain an event." The point requires qualification. An indefinite number of why-questions could be raised about any given event, so no finite discourse could ever completely explain it. But a particular individual might be interested in only a finite number of those questions, and a finite discourse could answer them all. Thus, a number of complete answers to specific why-questions, each a partial "explanation of the event," could together comprise a complete explanation of the event-but only relative to the interests of a particular questioner at a particular time. Could a specific why-question have a partial answer? Hempel pointed out a plausible sense in which it could: a why-question has been given a partial answer if a complete answer to a less specific version of it has been provided. His example (Hempel: 415f.) is an explanation Freud gave for a certain slip of his (Freud's) pen. Hempel points out that at best Freud has explained only why some slip or other, expressive of a certain wish, was to be expected. But we might take it as a partial explanation of the particular slip that occurred. As Hempel notes, that example raises a lot of issues besides the one he is interested in. Here is a hypothetical example with fewer side issues. Someone asks a geologist why Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1980. The geologist can't answer that specific question but does manage to assemble information on the basis of which it was quite likely that the vol- cano would erupt sometime in the latter half of the twentieth century. That would be a partial explanation in Hempel's sense. In certain cases two explanations that are partial in this sense can be combined into a complete one. Hempel (418f.) discusses such cases under the heading of "overdetermination" and gives a simple example, which I will elaborate a little. Suppose a copper wire is simultaneously heated and subjected to longitudinal stress. Each operation lengthens it. If someone now asks why the wire is longer, we have two (complete!) explanations. If the question is why the wire is 1.3 centimeters longer, we have two partial explanations. If each is now spelled out further, so that we learn the heat- ing was enough to lengthen the wire by 0.8 centimeters, and the stretching sufficed by itself to lengthen it by 0.5, the two partial explanations would together provide a complete one.</page><page sequence="10">22 Journal of the American Academy of Religion It seems unlikely that explanations from diverse theoretical frame- works would dovetail as neatly and simply as the two explanations in the copper-wire example. The more diverse the frameworks, the less likely it is that we could construct a common scale on which the respective con- tributions of the explanatory factors could be parceled out quantitatively. For an extreme example, consider the conversion of Stephen Bradley (a well-known case of William James's, discussed by both Proudfoot and Barnard, to which we will return in Section 4). It would surely be ludi- crous to suppose that we could attribute 70% of the increase in Bradley's heart rate to natural causes, the rest to the action of the Holy Spirit. But why-questions have further subtleties to be explored. Bas van Fraassen has pointed out (126ff., 141ff.) that even when a why-question is spelled out in the form "Why is it the case that X?," where X is a sentence, it is still elliptically framed. Two or more quite different questions could share that incomplete formulation. For an unambiguous formulation of the exact question, we need to specify a "contrast class" and a "relevance relation." The notion of a contrast class is the clearer and less problematic, so let us consider it first. (We will return to the matter of relevance rela- tions in Section 4.) Van Fraassen's idea is that why-questions, when fully specified, always ask why X rather than one of a set of alternatives Y, Z, .... Sometimes the alternatives are explicitly stated; more often they are left implicit, being considered to be obvious from the context. Two people who ask "Why X?" are asking different questions if they have different contrast classes in mind, and an attempted explanation will misfire if the explainer's contrast class is not the same as the questioner's. An old yarn about the legendary outlaw Willie Sutton, retold by Alan Garfinkel (21f.), illustrates this nicely. A priest asks Sutton why he robs banks. "Because that's where the money is,' replies Willie. The priest wanted to know why Willie robbed banks instead of earning his bread by honest toil. Willie's answer explained why he robbed banks rather than candy stores, dry goods emporia, etc. He an- swered a question that could be elliptically expressed, "Why do you rob banks?" (perhaps it was the only such question he could think of), but not the question the priest meant to ask. The Sutton story also illustrates another, closely related point. In any why-question some things will also be taken (usually tacitly) as given; the question is why X, given A and B. Sutton took being a robber as given; for the priest, the given was only that he had to make a living somehow. If Sutton had inherited money, a friend who knew his distaste for labor might have asked why he robbed banks (rather than live a life of coupon- clipping ease). What will qualify as an adequate answer to a why-question will thus depend on what the questioner takes as given and what the alternatives in</page><page sequence="11">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 23 the questioner's intended contrast class are. Thus, three people might ask why Sutton robbed banks. The first of them, like the priest in the story, asks the question in that form because that is, in fact, what Sutton did, but what this questioner really wants to know is why Sutton became a crook. The second person takes that as given and wants to know why he special- izes in robbing banks. For the third questioner the alternatives include Sutton's holding up saloons, his becoming a riverboat gambler, and vari- ous other ways of making a living, some of them reputable. Now some- one offers an account of Sutton's deprived childhood, bad company in his youth, and other circumstances that show how unsurprising it was that he should take up a life of crime. For the first of our questioners that will be a fully adequate explanation. For the second questioner it is no explanation at all. For the third it is a partial explanation; it eliminates some but not all of the alternatives in the contrast class. It would need to be supplemented by a further explanation of the sort the second ques- tioner is asking for. This simple example illustrates how the same answer could be a complete explanation, no explanation at all, or a partial explanation- depending on the exact why-question with its implicit contrast class. If we attend carefully to contrast classes, we can discern yet another sense in which an explanation can be partial. It does not show up in the Sutton ex- ample, because there each questioner has just one contrast class in mind. But when the object of explanation is a complex phenomenon, the expla- nation-seeker may have several distinct questions. As we have seen, a com- plete answer to one of the specific questions would then count as a partial explanation, for that questioner, of the concrete phenomenon. Now we can see a further way of differentiating questions: the questioner may want to know why X rather than Y or Z, and why X rather than P or Q or R. To illustrate the point, let us consider (in a very drastically simplified and schematic way) the extinction of the dinosaurs. As everyone knows, this is a much-debated topic. But let us, simplifying, suppose that the al- ternative explanations are 1) that the extinction was caused by the impact, circa 65 million years ago, of a comet, and 2) that it was caused by long- term climatic changes over a period of several million years. Let us take as established that there really was a major impact and that the long-term climatic changes invoked by the proponents of that hypothesis really did take place. And, finally, let us suppose that the number of dinosaur genera declined according to the following pattern (Eldredge: 109f., slightly sim- plified). Up to 70 million years ago the number was steady at just about 30; thereafter, at million-year intervals, the dinosaur-genus census figures were 22, 18, 12, 7, and 0. Partisans of the climate theory will say the dinosaurs were on their way out anyway; the bolide impact just speeded up their exit a bit. Thus,</page><page sequence="12">24 Journal of the American Academy of Religion if the contrast class is simply "dinosaurs long since extinct" versus "dinosaurs still here," the climate theory provides a sufficient (complete) explanation. But, if it is taken as given that they were in decline, and the question is why the dinosaur line terminated around 65 million years ago rather than later, the impact provides a complete explanation. Finally, if the explanandum is the whole pattern of their decline and extinction, we could say that each hypothesis provides a partial explanation and together they give a complete one. So far what we have is a pretty close parallel to the Sutton example. But in the case of the dinosaurs there is another why-question, with a quite different contrast class. Why was it the dinosaurs that went extinct, while the turtles, the crocodilians, and our small mammalian ancestors all survived? That is another question, and our combined climate-change plus comet theory might not answer it. On the other hand, there might be a hypothesis that would not have provided sufficient grounds to have expected the dinosaurs' actual demise but would show why they were more vulnerable than the crocodilians and the turtles. That hypothesis would then provide an explanation of why, given that one of those rep- tilian groups would go extinct, it would be the dinosaurs. In the dinosaur case we see how two quite different theories, usually thought to be in opposition, can be combined to provide a fuller explana- tion than either alone could give. The analytic machinery introduced by van Fraassen and Garfinkel thus promises to be quite helpful, at least in analyzing the relations between two naturalistic explanations, even when they draw on significantly different theoretical resources. Those who hold that religious explanations have a radically distinctive character may still doubt that that distinctive character can be elucidated by reference to contrast classes and the like. Deferring discussion of specifically religious explanations to Section 4, in the next section I will consider a case of a religious phenomenon for which two very different-seeming naturalistic explanations have been offered. 3. THE BIBLICAL BAN ON PORK: A CASE STUDY Why was pork forbidden to the Hebrew people? Two distinguished anthropologists, Mary Douglas and Marvin Harris, have offered strikingly different explanations. Their explanations look like rivals, but we are now in a position to see how they answer different questions and actually com- plement one another rather nicely. Both explanations are, in fact, naturalistic and indeed reductive by Proudfoot's definition. So we shall be looking at a case of partial, comple- mentary explanations from the perspectives provided by two naturalistic</page><page sequence="13">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 25 theories. It is not a case study of relations between naturalistic and reli- gious explanations. Yet one thing that makes the case particularly inter- esting is that people with a visceral antipathy to "reductionism" are likely to find Douglas's account much more congenial than Harris's. Harris explains the prohibition as a matter of down-to-earth econom- ics. Though pork is temptingly tasty, it is a difficult and costly business to raise pigs in climates like that of ancient Israel. They are descended from forest boars and are not adapted to heat and aridity. Further, not being ruminants, they cannot digest cellulose; where cattle and sheep can live on grass and straw and other tough fibers, the nutritional requirements of pigs are more like those of people. Moreover, unlike cattle and sheep, pigs have no uses other than to provide meat. A simple cost-benefit analysis shows that the Israelites should eschew raising swine, and they won't be tempted to raise them if they aren't allowed to eat them. Douglas, on the other hand, speaks of meanings and levels of mean- ing, symbols and resonances of symbols made possible by shared struc- tures; and she explicitly disavows reductionism. (I am not sure how she would define that term; clearly her definition is not Proudfoot's.) Her answer to the question why pork was forbidden was first presented in a famous chapter of her book Purity and Danger (1966: chapter 3), and was extended and somewhat modified in two later essays (1975: chapters 16 and 17). Douglas set out not only to explain specifically why pigs were con- demned as "unclean" but to uncover the principle underlying the whole range of clean/unclean classifications in Leviticus. Very briefly described, the pattern Douglas found was this: the clean animals are those that pos- sess the full range of attributes characteristic of the class to which they belong; those that fail to fall clearly within a class are unclean, as are those that have only some of the critical attributes of their class or embody attributes characteristic of more than one class. The paradigmatic marks of a proper terrestrial vertebrate are cloven hoofs and cud-chewing; pigs are defective and unclean because non-ruminant. Proper water-dwellers have fins and scales; so shellfish are unclean (as are sharks). And so on, not only for dietary laws but for all the many requirements and prohibi- tions that specify what is clean and what is unclean, all hinging on an underlying idea of wholeness. How is all this a matter of "meaning"? Since all the laws express and uphold the themes of purity and wholeness, by observing the laws one celebrates and honors those themes and becomes holy: "If the proposed interpretation ... is correct, the dietary laws would have been like signs which at every turn inspired meditation on the oneness, purity and com- pleteness of God. By rules of avoidance holiness was given a physical</page><page sequence="14">26 Journal of the American Academy of Religion expression in every encounter with the animal kingdom and at every meal" (Douglas 1966:57). In a later essay Douglas acknowledges that her explanation in Purity and Danger was incomplete, in the sense of inviting further why- questions-which indeed were not just further questions but essential to a proper formulation of the original questions: "It was even against the whole spirit of my book to offer an account of an ordered system of thought which did not show the context of social relations in which the categories had meaning" (1975: 261). Why did the Israelites, unlike many other peoples, make purity and separateness the hallmarks of the sacred, abominating hybrids and boundary-crossers? (Contrast the Lele of cen- tral Africa, for whom the pangolin-a tree-dwelling mammal covered with scales-is sacred precisely because it combines so many features that belong ordinarily to members of different classes.) To see the reason for the difference, we must consider their respective relations with their neighbors. Where the Lele way of life involves a complex pattern of peace- ful trade and marital exchanges with the inhabitants of foreign villages (Douglas 1975: 297ff.), the Israelites had constantly to defend a land they had won by conquest. Sharpness of taxonomic boundaries stands for, and acquires the emotional weight of, their constantly threatened physical boundaries (269). (It is here that Douglas reassures her readers that what she is espousing is not reductionistic; unfortunately she merely says she is "not here reducing the dietary rules to any political concern," without indicating what such a reductive account would look like.) These bald, sparse summaries do not do justice to either author's explanations, of course; but they will allow us to see some of the ways in which the explanations complement one another. They certainly differ in tone, and that tempts one to think it would be hard to accept both. But let us consider exactly what why-questions each answers and what each takes as given. Douglas tells us that certain animals are unclean because they have boundary-crossing combinations of qualities or fail to exhibit the full range of qualities paradigmatic for the cosmological domain they inhabit. And she tells us why boundaries and wholeness were important to the Israelites. But she takes as sheer givens the particular combinations of traits that are paradigmatic for each class. These, however, are not exactly self-evident. Why should the combination of chewing the cud and cleav- ing the foot be the norm for terrestrial animals? Harris can answer that question, up to a point. As we have seen, Harris shows that it made excellent sense for the Israelites to forego pork in favor of the flesh of ruminants. But why are cloven hoofs important? Harris's answer is that the class of ruminants</page><page sequence="15">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 27 includes camels; the cloven-hoofs requirement was added in order to rule them out of the ranks of the clean. But why should they be ruled out? Harris answers that camels were not a significant factor in the economy of village-dwelling Israelites, so nothing is lost if their flesh is forbidden. Fair enough; but why would a ban be needed? The camel is just one example of a general limitation on the ex- planatory scope of Harris's theory: Leviticus forbids a lot of things that no one would have any inclination to eat anyway. It's true that no nutritional harm is done, but it is equally true that no nutritional harm would be done if these things were permitted. We can put the point this way: given that every animal is to be ruled clean or unclean, Harris can show how the crucial rulings follow what a good cost-benefit analysis would call for, and none of the rulings conflict with what a cost-benefit analyst would recom- mend. But as to why there should be explicit rulings about everything, Harris has no answer. Douglas seems somewhat better placed to answer that question. For each specific rule reinforces the themes of wholeness and boundary-maintenance and provides more occasions for "meditation on the oneness, purity and completeness of God." On the other hand, as we have seen, Harris has a plausible explanation for something that Douglas must take as given, viz., the particular combi- nation of characteristics that Leviticus takes as definitive for "clean" ani- mals of the land. What of the air and the sea? No more than Douglas does Harris attempt to explain why the combination of fins and scales is the hallmark of cleanliness for water-dwellers. Birds are difficult to deal with, because the unclean ones are merely enumerated, with no criterion speci- fied. But the merits of Harris's explanatory scheme as a complement to that of Douglas show up clearly again in the intriguing case of the locusts. Whereas Deuteronomy 14:19 declares all winged insects unclean, Leviticus 11:21 makes an exception: "among the winged things that go on all fours you may eat those which have legs above their feet, with which to leap upon the earth." Why are the boundaries gerrymandered to allow locust-eating? To answer this question Harris appeals (165-170) to "opti- mal foraging theory," a set of principles originally developed by ecolo- gists to account for the dietary habits of nonhuman animals but easily extended to humans. This theory "predicts that hunters or collectors will pursue or harvest only those species which maximize the rate of caloric return for the time they spend foraging." For humans, insects will usually not be worth bothering about, but under certain circumstances locusts are an exception. Uniquely among insects, they can be a significant food source for human agriculturalists for two reasons. First, they come in huge swarms and are relatively large to begin with, so many calories can be gleaned with little effort. Second, their very destructiveness moves</page><page sequence="16">28 Journal of the American Academy of Religion them up in the food-source rankings: they aren't as good a source as your crops, so it wouldn't be worth seeking them out, but when your crops are gone they can provide a stopgap substitute. The nutritional consequences of banning their consumption could be serious. (One of Harris's most telling general points is that no people's dietary taboos pose a nutritional threat in their circumstances; and the spread of Islam encountered firm resistance precisely where pork was a staple of the local diet.) There is an interesting point of convergence between Harris and Dou- glas, and it raises one further matter of some importance. They both think (Douglas 1966:54; Harris 74f.) that the dietary laws were very prob- ably codifications of pre-existing dietary patterns. If so, we can see the relative strengths of their respective explanatory accounts in a new light: Harris explains the dietary patterns, and Douglas explains why they were codified and sacralized. The situation calls to mind a point that Stephen Jay Gould never tires of making in the context of evolutionary biology: to show the current utility of a trait (organ, behavior pattern, etc.) is not to explain how it came about in the first place. If we want to explain (as fully as possible) why a trait is now present, we need to answer several questions. First, we must explain how it came to be fixed in the population. If it is no longer adaptive in the way it was then, we need to ask whether it is now adaptive in some other way. If so, the question is how it acquired its new function. If not, the question is how it came to be so locked into the developmental pattern of the species in question as to persist in spite of selection pres- sures against it. It would be interesting, but would take us too far afield, to explore how far the biological analogy can be carried through in a discus- sion of the Jewish dietary laws-and the Islamic ones. I will merely note that to show how observance of them promotes a distinctive group iden- tity and contributes a certain quality of dedication to life is to offer only a partial explanation. It leaves unexplained 1) why these goods are achieved by means of a set of prohibitions and requirements, rather than in some other way; and 2) why, given that it is to be a matter of prohibitions, these particular foods are the ones to be prohibited. I said at the beginning of the section that both Harris's and Doug- las's accounts are naturalistic-and reductive by Proudfoot's definition. God appears in Douglas's explanans but only as the intentional object of the Israelites' beliefs and attitudes. A nonbeliever could accept either her explanation or Harris's (or, I have suggested, both.) Both explanations are presented "in terms that are not those of the [believers] and might not meet with [their] approval." Both authors reject two explanations that have been, at various times, popular among believers: the Maimonidean theory that pork is unhealthy to eat, and the view that the prohibitions are to be read allegorically, as having to do with vices suggested in one way or</page><page sequence="17">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 29 another by the habits of the proscribed creatures (Harris: 68ff.; Douglas 1966: 29ff., 46ff.). On the other hand, Douglas is careful to deny (1975: 309f.) that her explanation undermines the credibility of the Israelites' beliefs. She rhetorically asks her readers to think of a better way for a deity, with the objectives Yahweh was held to have for Israel, to achieve them. Her expla- nation might not meet with a believer's approval, but she sees no reason why it shouldn't. The believer would presumably regard it as incomplete but need not think it wrong. The believer could think of what Douglas has done as explaining (in part) why God issued these particular commands. Of course, the very same thing could be said of Harris's explanation: God forbade pork because He knew it would be economically harmful for His people to raise pigs. In either case, we have an interesting variation on a pattern of partial explanation that I briefly mentioned, and set aside, at the beginning of Section 2. There I said that "because Y" might be considered a partial explanation for "why X" by someone who felt a need to press the further question "why Y." Suppose that question were then satisfactorily an- swered, "because Z," and the questioner felt no need to ask "why Z." That questioner would then be in possession of a complete explanation for X. (As we saw, completeness is relative to questioners' interests.) An interest- ing feature of our anthropologists' explanations of the ban on pork is that, from the believer's point of view, they answer "why X" with "because Z," skipping Y. They show how it was in the Israelites' interests to have a rule forbidding pork but don't say how the rule came to be promulgated and adopted. Either a believer or an unbeliever might consider such an expla- nation incomplete, though, of course, they would disagree as to what sort of answer should fill the role of "Y." At first glance it might appear that we had found a simple model of a way in which naturalistic and religious explanations might be related, albeit a surprising one, in that God seems to be functioning as the proxi- mate rather than the ultimate cause. For that and other reasons, many theologians and theorists of religion-certainly those that Proudfoot criticizes-would find the model (and the sort of "religious explanation" it incorporates) too simple and anthropomorphic to be satisfactory. So the question of the relation between religious and naturalistic explanations remains to be addressed. 4. WHAT IS A "RELIGIOUS EXPLANATION"? We have developed some tools for analyzing the relations among dif- ferent explanations of a phenomenon, and they appear to be helpful, at least where the explanations in question are "naturalistic." But will they</page><page sequence="18">30 Journal of the American Academy of Religion help us to understand the relations between a "naturalistic" and a "reli- gious" explanation? The obvious first step toward answering that question would be to find answers for the prior questions: What is a "religious explanation"? Among the various explanations people offer, which ones count as "reli- gious"? Let us first consider two types of answer, each of which figures prominently in Proudfoot's book. One seemingly straightforward answer is that a religious explanation is one in which concepts distinctive of some religious community are employed. That invites the further question, Which communities count as religious? But perhaps we can bypass that one: the well-known border- line cases raise no problems (pertinent to the issues we are discussing) beyond those raised by the paradigm cases. That answer in itself gives no reason to expect that the range of rela- tions that could hold between a religious and a naturalistic explanation would be greatly different from the range of relations for two naturalistic explanations. But many theologians and religious studies scholars will be dissatisfied with it. One reason for dissatisfaction comes to mind when we reflect on the following series of questions: Why does the raccoon wear a bandit's mask? Why did a volcano erupt, destroying Sodom and Gomor- rah? Why are the planetary orbits in our solar system nearly circular and nearly coplanar? Why are momentum and energy conserved? Why is there a cosmos at all; why not nothing, or a chaos? Answers to all these why- questions have been put forward from within, using the conceptual re- sources of, religious communities. Nevertheless, many interpreters would now say with regard to several of them that religious answers were never appropriate, that it would be a mistake to think of the proffered explana- tions as genuinely religious. Communities that we think of as religious have among their early traditions some that should be considered proto- scientific; and some more recent thinkers (Newton, for instance) have mistakenly treated statements about God as though they were scientific hypotheses. If the people who say such things are right, it will not suffice to define religious explanations as those that emerge from, and employ terms characteristic of, religious communities. Some other type of defini- tion is needed. A second answer, central to the "protective strategies"' of the authors Proudfoot criticizes, is to say that religious explanations (whatever their exact nature) are those that are appropriate for religious phenomena, and 1 I think that Proudfoot is quite right in characterizing various proposals of Schleiermacher, Eliade, and others as protective strategies. But the strategies are two-sided. Some of the authors who have adopted them have been as much concerned to protect the sciences from interfering theologians as to protect the tender shoots of religion from the cold harsh winds of science.</page><page sequence="19">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 31 religious phenomena are precisely those that cannot be explained, or can- not be fully explained, in naturalistic terms. If this answer is right, the analytic machinery developed in previous sections might well seem to have little applicability to the relation between religious and naturalistic explanations. Obviously it makes a great difference whether the criterion is "cannot be explained" or "cannot be fully explained." To say "cannot be fully ex- plained" is to allow that naturalistic theories can provide partial explana- tions of religious phenomena and to invite the further question whether religious explanations thereof are not also "partial." Some proponents of the criterion we are considering might be content to say that reli- gious explanations are partial too, but I suspect that most would think this puts the naturalistic and religious explanations too much on a par and undercuts the project of sharply differentiating religious phenomena from others. But they will have to tread carefully. For how could it be that the religious explanation was complete, while the naturalistic ones were only partial? The obvious way would be for the former to incorporate the latter; and while some theologians might welcome that solution, it can hardly be congenial to those who want to keep religion and the sciences at a safe dis- tance from one another. So they might, on reflection, prefer to say that religious phenomena are those that cannot be even partially explained naturalistically. But there is a pitfall in defining religious phenomena that way. In the absence of an independent identification of certain phenomena as religious, an uncom- promising naturalist can cheerfully accept the definition and blandly con- clude that there are no such things as religious phenomena and thus nothing for religious explanations to explain. What we really seem to need is a more direct characterization of what a religious explanation is. If, as we have been assuming, an explanation is an answer to a why-question, perhaps the most promising approach would be to try to determine which why-questions should be counted as religious ones. It is often said that religious explanations answer different questions from those answered by scientific (or, more generally, natural- istic) explanations. We found in Section 2 that often explanations that seem to be competitors are actually answers to different questions, which sound identical only because elliptically formulated. And we saw some ways of explicating the questions so that their distinctness, and some of their mutual relations, become apparent. So perhaps the analytic machin- ery developed earlier will suffice to differentiate religious questions from others, and perhaps the relations between religious and naturalistic expla- nations will after all be closely analogous to those that can obtain between one naturalistic explanation and another.</page><page sequence="20">32 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Perhaps so. But many will feel that some further means of differentia- tion is needed. Religious questions seem to be not just different questions but somehow "different in kind," motivated by a different kind of interest. At least I think that is (a large part of) what the naturalistic-explanation- resisting interpreters of religion are trying to say. The distinguishable questions answered by different hypotheses as to the demise of the dino- saurs, for instance, do not seem to be comparably "different in kind" from one another, nor do the questions answered by Douglas's and Harris's hypotheses. Obviously, this locution "different in kind" urgently needs explication. Alas, I cannot provide it. But van Fraassen's notion of "relevance rela- tions"-mentioned above, with its exposition and discussion deferred- may provide some pointers toward the needed explication and a handy way of applying it once it is achieved. To see what van Fraassen means by a "relevance relation," it will be helpful to back up and recall Hempel's basic model. According to Hempel, an explanation is an argument, in which the explanandum-statement is inferred (deductively or with high inductive probability) from a set of premises, the explanans. Hempel distinguishes between "potential" and "true" explanations: we have a potential explanation if the explanandum- statement can be inferred from the explanans, a true explanation if in addition the explanans is true (338). Generalizing Hempel's distinction (since not everyone-not van Fraassen, for instance-would agree that an explanation is an argument), we might say that on any account of expla- nation there will be an explanatory relation (analogous to inferability), and the question whether or not the explanatory relation holds between explanans and explanandum is distinct from the question whether the explanans is true. If the relation holds, and the explanans is true, we have a "true explanation." If the relation holds, and the explanans is not known to be false or excessively unlikely, we have a "potential explanation." An answer to a why-question could be an explanation in either of the two senses, depending on its truth-status. The terminology of "true" and "potential," though quite natural, is misleading in a way. It is worth a short digression to see how. Often, in academic writing and everyday discourse alike, people speak of "explana- tion" simpliciter when the context makes it clear that they are claiming only that the explanatory relation is satisfied. Logicians recognize, and many attach great importance to, an argument form known as "inference to the best explanation." In an argument of this kind, a hypothesis H is inferred to be true (or probably true) on the grounds that it provides a better explanation of the relevant data than does any of the alternative hypotheses (see Lipton). Obviously, the term "explanation" is not there being used in a sense that requires that H be already established as true.</page><page sequence="21">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 33 The point is worth mentioning because the fact that "explanation" is used in both senses is a fertile source of misunderstanding. In particular, I suspect that one reason Proudfoot and Barnard are somewhat at cross- purposes is that Barnard takes "explanation" in the "true explanation" sense, and Proudfoot often uses the term in the "potential explanation" sense. In introducing the idea of "relevance relations," van Fraassen is, in effect, saying that there is not just one "explanatory relation" but sev- eral. Van Fraassen defines a relevance relation as a "respect-in-which a rea- son is requested, which determines what shall count as a possible explana- tory factor" (142). Relevance relations come into the picture because people who ask why-questions are often looking for a particular sort of information-about the events leading up to the explanandum-phenome- non, or the purpose it served, for example. As these examples hint, van Fraassen regards Aristotle's theory of the four "causes" as a promising early typology of relevance relations (131). He holds that a more exact, com- plete, up-to-date typology is needed, but he has not attempted to provide one. I cannot here attempt to fill that lacuna in van Fraassen's theory, but some useful observations are possible even so. There are distinct relevance relations because a variety of (types of) interests motivate people's why-questions. As the Willie Sutton example in Section 2 showed, people's diverse interests often lead to their why- questions' having different implicit (or explicit) contrast classes. But not always. Van Fraassen's point is that identically-phrased questions, with the same contrast classes, will still be different if the interests motivating them are sufficiently different to involve different relevance relations. An answer to a why-question could thus be complete, relative to a given relevance relation, but partial if several relevance relations pertain, as could happen if the questioner has more than one kind of interest in the explanandum- phenomenon. (Note also that for some combinations of explananda and relevance relations there might be no possible answer that satisfies the relation.) The idea that there are distinct relevance relations can help us under- stand situations in which whole families of what some people regard as good explanations are dismissed by others as completely non-explanatory. When people say things like "science doesn't explain, it only describes" or "science tells us how things happen, not why," they presumably have in mind one particular relevance relation and recognize no other. Their why-questions tacitly include a stipulation that only an answer in terms of (ultimate?) purposes served will be relevant. On the other hand, people who say "science tells us causes, religion meanings" can be understood as recognizing two distinct relevance re- lations and holding that information of the sort scientists can provide</page><page sequence="22">34 Journal of the American Academy of Religion satisfies one of them, while the other requires religious answers. In gen- eral, people who want to maintain the autonomy of religious explanations while acknowledging the legitimacy of naturalistic ones can do so if they can establish that among the various relevance relations there is a dis- tinct religious one. Religious and naturalistic explanations would thus be orthogonal to one another, so to speak, and there would be no question of better and worse, for it is only under a particular relevance relation that one (potential) explanation can be better than another. That last point is important. For one thing, it means that inference-to- the-best-explanation arguments are applicable only in contexts where only one relevance relation need be taken into account. For another, it raises interesting questions about cases in which people come to accept naturalistic explanations of certain of their experiences, instead of the reli- gious explanations they had accepted hitherto. Are they making a mistake, failing to recognize that there are distinct relevance relations involved? Maybe so, but there are other possibilities. To illustrate them, let us sup- pose (implausibly, but it's only an illustration) that at some point Stephen Bradley had come to accept a naturalistic explanation of the experience he had previously attributed to the work of the Holy Spirit. One scenario in which this could happen would be that Bradley's religious fervor had so far cooled that he had completely lost the interests that underlay his original why-question. There would then be, for him, no relevance relation in terms of which his palpitations had an explanation, and he would be open to other explanations with other relevance relations. On the other hand, if our hypothetical Bradley was making a mis- take, it may have been a quite understandable one. After all, what sort of explanation religious explanations are supposed to provide is one of the things people learn in the course of their religious training. If Bradley was brought up in a tradition within which religious questions were not clearly distinguished from quasi-scientific ones, he might never have had reason to suspect that there is more than one explanatory relation. In terms of the relation he knew, the religious explanation might have been the only possibility available to him, and a naturalistic explanation might have seemed better when one came along. Whether or not this scenario is plausible for Bradley, it surely fits many actual cases. Van Fraassen's "relevance relation" idea opens up intriguing possibili- ties for anyone looking for a way to articulate the intuitive sense that reli- gious and scientific explanation answer different "kinds" of question. But the sober truth is that nearly all the work remains to be done. It would be "deeply superficial"2 just to stipulate that there is a relevance relation that 2 The phrase is borrowed from Richard Dawkins (241), who uses it in a very different context (though he would doubtless agree with the point made in the text).</page><page sequence="23">Austin: Explanatory Pluralism 35 only religious answers can satisfy and then draw the desired conclusions. One would have to work out a typology of relevance relations, which in turn would require producing a cogent taxonomy of genuinely distinct explanatory interests. And, of course, one would need to show that among these interests is a distinctively religious one. These are not trivial tasks. EPILOGUE: EXPLAINING THE UNEXPLAINABLE Finally, let us see what sense we can make of the paradoxical phrase, "explaining the unexplainable:" It crops up now and then in article titles and other contexts, but what can it mean? The least interesting occurrences of the phrase are those in which one of the key words is embraced in tacit quotation marks, i.e., where an author is 1) trying to expose as spurious a purported "explanation" of something the author regards as genuinely unexplainable, or 2) offering an explanation of something that others mistakenly believe to be "unex- plainable." Can the concept of explaining the unexplainable be given a coherent interpretation in which both terms are meant seriously, without quotation marks? I want to suggest two ways in which this could be done. The first way becomes visible when we take van Fraassen's relevance relations into account. A phenomenon might be genuinely unexplainable under one relevance relation-there may simply be no propositions that bear that relation to the explanandum-and explainable under another relevance relation. The paradox disappears when the different relevance relations are made explicit. The second way requires recognition of a distinctly peculiar sense of "explanation," which nonetheless seems defensible (provided its odd- ness is kept clearly in mind). In order to introduce it, let us consider the fact that sometimes people "explain" an event by attributing it to chance (that is: "it happened by chance" is their answer to the why-question). Is that just a disguised admission of inability to explain? Not necessarily; not exactly. Let us define an "explanation in the standard sense" as a satisfac- tory answer to a why-question. And let us define an "explanatory quest" as a search for such an answer. Now sometimes it is possible to give good rea- sons for thinking that, in the current state of knowledge at least, a particu- lar explanatory quest is extremely unlikely to succeed, so that the rational thing to do is to abandon it. With that in mind, let us define an "expla- nation in the broader sense" as any set of considerations that give good reasons for terminating an explanatory quest. An explanation in the stan- dard sense would thus also be an explanation in the broader sense but so would a set of good reasons for thinking that the quest is futile (at least for the foreseeable future). A broader-sense explanation that is not also a</page><page sequence="24">36 Journal of the American Academy of Religion standard-sense explanation might be called (in recognition of its oddity) a "stretched-sense" explanation. "It happened by chance" might then be an acceptable shorthand for a stretched-sense explanation, if the speaker was prepared to supply good reasons for thinking the explanatory quest futile. It is interesting to note that in cases where "the unexplainable" has been "explained" in the stretched sense, the paradox recurs in an agree- ably heightened form: not only have we explained the unexplainable, we have explained it by showing that it is unexplainable! Of course, the para- dox disappears when the distinction in senses of "explain" is recognized. But its temporary recurrence does underscore the oddness of stretched- sense explanations. However, they are not mere oddities, for it is possible that some or all religious explanations are stretched-sense explanations. That suggestion would tie in well with the familiar thesis that religious symbols and ideas have to do with "limiting situations." To spell it out sufficiently to see what it comes to would be a major undertaking, beyond the scope of an Epilogue. One key question would be, What sorts of reasons for abandon- ing an explanatory quest are required if we are to have even a stretched- sense explanation? Evoking a general sense of mystery and contingency would not seem to qualify, nor would convincing someone that there are better things to do in life than to ask why-questions. REFERENCES Barnard, G.
