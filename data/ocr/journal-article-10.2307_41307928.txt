Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2006, XVIII + 278 S., 2 maps, 75 figs., 18 pls., ISBN-0-226-24044-4 (cloth), $60.-. The Late Bronze Age was a highly active period of cultural interchange throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. The movement of people in war and peace, in battle and trade, as individuals and in groups brought about a movement of goods, in particular from the middle of the second millennium BCE onwards. Supra- regional contacts seem to have led towards a development in artistic production characterised by copying or borrowing, adapting or blending techniques, forms, and motifs across media. The difficult task of dating, separating traditions, locating places of origin, and find- ing explanatory frameworks for the distribution of objects has attracted much attention over the years.1 The written evidence, however - mainly from the "Amarna Correspond- ence" - is sparse and biased while the archaeological material is widely distributed and heterogeneous. Much attention has been paid to the artistic phenomenon during the Late Bronze Age whereby similar ornaments and motifs are found across media.2 The Egyptologist W. Stevenson Smith was the first to call this phenomenon "International Style" in his monograph "Interconnections in the Ancient Near East". According to Smith, an "International Style" developed in the 16th century BCE from an increasing amount of diplomatic gift- exchange between palaces that came to a climax in the Amarna-Period.3 It should be noted that Smith introduced the term "International Style" into Near Eastern Archaeology rather casually, with very brief commentary. He considered "style" not in the art-historical sense but as "common habit". Thus, "International Style" referred to the "supra-regional" use of certain motifs in predominantly small-scale objets dyart, such as two gold bowls from Ugarit, a silver bowl from Enkomi, a silver bowl from Dendra, the ivory bed-panel from Ugarit, ivory inlays from Assur, and a wall-painting from Nuzi.4 Smith highlighted the common repertoire of certain plant ornaments in particular (pp. 18, 45, 107, 1 13). Following Smith, the label "International Style" was used in different ways, some- times in a rather narrow sense,5 sometimes in a broad one,6 and sometimes rather 1 Most recently in the exhibition "Beyond Babylon: art, trade, and diplomacy in the second millennium B.C.", New York, November 18, 2008-March 15, 2009 or the conference "Qatna and the networks of Bronze Age globalism", Stuttgart, October 17-20, 2009. 2 R.

Crowley, who tried to confine the term "International Style" to small-scale objects of precious charac- ter dating to the Late Bronze Age.8 According to Crowley, such objects display "cohesive integrated designs", but lack "distinct national style" and thus prevent direct allocation to place of origin (p. 221). In order to form "cohesive patterning", Crowley suggested that (foreign) elements have to be accepted by and "incorporated" into a local style. Foreign elements which do not blend into an overall design are considered "intrusive" (pp. 202-213). She wrote that artisans were able to make a deliberate choice between international and national styles (pp. 226, 228-229 n. 17). Problematic to her analysis, however, is the fact that any notion of "cohesive design" is bound to reflect the opinion of archaeologists of today. Marian Feldman has more recently entered the subject with a PhD dissertation, two articles,9 and the monograph under review.10 The introduction to the book serves as a summary of all aspects to be discussed.11 Part I, chapter 1, has an axiomatic layout where the term "International Style" is discussed with a new label. Chapter 2 introduces the concept of visual hybridity, chapter 3 comments on iconography and meaning in images, and chapter 4 considers style and manufacture. Part II deals with objects, types of luxury items, and diplomatic gifts (chapter 5), their material and manufacture (chapter 6), and their distribution in time and space (chapter 7). This section concludes in chapter 8 with a short overview of international correspondence during the Late Bronze Age. In Part III, Feldman offers an interpretation of "International Style" items when used in diplomatic gift exchange (chapter 9), and concludes the book by using the petty kingdom of Ugarit as a case-study for her broader ideas (chapter 10). The many illustrations of Marian Feldman s book are a distinct advantage, and it has been widely praised for that. Helpful would have been a catalogue of items discussed, as well as objects considered by Feldman to be of "International Style." Such a catalogue was part of the PhD dissertation, but it was omitted in the monograph. However, we 111, 112-113 [discussion]; D. Preziosi/L.A.

She claims to give a new definition and critical review of the term and, by employing a multidisciplinary approach, to suggest a new explanation for the phenomenon. Yet, she never asks the basic question: does a concept of "Interna- tional Style" hold true. From the beginning, she posits that "International Style" objects play a role in diplomatic exchange, in a world where "... kings of culturally disparate states interacted with one another in an idealized rhetorical mode of parity and reci- procity" (p. 8). "International Style" is thus regarded as a visual manifestation of the cultural interaction taking place in the Late Bronze Age community, which, according to Feldman, had become a distinct socio-political entity (p. 8). Hybrid character of this style, which suppressed any local prevalence, needed to incorporate neutrality to be accepted by all participating parties (pp. 13-17, 159-164). It is this view that sets the scene for Feldman s research and the way she selects and interprets the material. In our opinion, Feldman starts a critical discussion of "International Style" by simply renaming the phenomenon "international artistic koine" coming close to her notion of the phenomenon as an "adopted set of shared cultural forms across cultural boundaries" (p. 30). This definition covers a coherent artistic tradition that shares motifs and themes, composition, "idiom", techniques, materials, and types of objects (pp. 56-58). However, this definition presupposes that such criteria were considered and acknowledged among the ancient participants, an assumption which cannot be proved - as Feldman concedes herself (p. 30; this will be discussed in more detail below). In Feldman's opinion, "In- ternational Style" is a term far too formalistic, one that inhibits contextual approaches (pp. 3, 25, 29). However, in our view, it is not the term that guides research, but the use of that term. Thus we maintain the use of the term "International Style" throughout this review. Feldman is not the first scholar to use the term "koine" with respect to the Late Bronze Age period. Kantor and Poursat applied that expression to describe the extent of Mycenaean culture, that is, Mycenaean art within cultural boundaries.13 It is rather the more recent notion of "eastern Mediterranean koine" that apparently influenced 12 This article is an abbreviated version of a longer essay by E. Fischer, UF 39 (2007) 803- 886 and a summary of D. Wicke's discussion of the Middle Assyrian material from Assur related to the "International Style" (D. Wicke, Kleinfunde aus Elfenbein und Knochen aus Assur, WVDOG 131 [Wiesbaden 2010] 52-55). The authors would like to thank E.A. Braun- Holzinger (Frankfurt a.M.), A. Busch (Mainz) and C. Lilyquist (New York) for their helpful comments. Any responsibility, of course, lies with the authors. 13 H.J. Kantor, The Aegean and the Orient in the second millennium B.C., AJA 51 (1947) 79: "... the Mycenaean koin£, which, despite local variations, enveloped mainland Greece as well as cities on Rhodes and Cyprus, in a common culture." Feldman misquotes Kantor when referring to her koine as something taking place along the Levantine coast and Cyprus (p. 26). Moreover, Feldman uses the works of Kantor and Poursat rather freely or even mistakenly when stating that Kantor should have developed her concept of a Mycenaean koine on the specific evidence of ivories (cf. H.J. Kantor, Syro-Palestinian ivories, JNES 15 [1956] 171). Poursat did not consider all ivories from mainland Greece, Crete, Rhodes, Cyprus, and the Aegean as Mycenaean per se - as implied by Feldman - but sought to distinguish between "Mycenaean" and "Mycenaeanizing" (J.-C. Poursat, Les ivoires myceniens: essai sur la formation d'un art mycenien [Athens 1977]).</page><page sequence="4">Buchbesprechungen 243 Feldman.14 In our view, such a broad application of the term koine contains several dangers and disadvantages: it suggests a community of (elite) social groups throughout the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East that is very difficult to prove and rather unlikely. The possibility that cultural traits could have been developed indigenously and locally is not entertained.15 Furthermore, a broad understanding of koine does not consider the possibility that formal similarities do not necessarily express similarities in content and meaning. Worst of all, it invites the scholar to disregard the necessary distinction of local traits in works of arts, and because of that, to avoid the tedious art- historical work of tracing motifs and elements to their origins. This basic art-historical work is overtly missing and without regard in Feldmans book. Findspots : A second problem concerns provenience. As the reader finds halfway through the book (p. 129), the author considers objects only with excavated origin. Thus two prominent objects are excluded which are otherwise considered part of the "Interna- tional Style" by Crowley (Nos. 501, 492): a gold disc said to be from Izmir (Chicago, OIM A29188) and a bronze applique said to be from Tyre (Paris, Louvre, AO 11601). Feldman tacitly ignores many more items without findspots, thus reducing her data considerably.16 This is somewhat surprising, since one characteristic feature of "Inter- national Style" objects is that they are impossible to localize because of their hybrid character (p. 5). Thus it does not make sense to ignore objects without proven findspot. A far more sound reason for exclusion would have been doubts on authenticity, but that factor is not discussed at all. Since Feldman reduces the corpus of koine items to luxury goods per definitionem , it becomes obvious that most of the objects will derive from elite contexts, such as palaces and royal tombs - an obvious vicious circle that raises considerable doubt on Feldman's main argument. It is easy to argue for an elite context when consciously omitting objects of common material. Types of Objects: We consider now the types of objects enlisted. Feldman defines koine objects mainly as small-scale, easy to carry luxury goods - such as clothes, vessels, furniture, weapons - made of precious and costly materials, e.g. gold, silver, ivory, alabaster, and faience. But we find her criteria for inclusion or exclusion of certain types of objects often hard to understand and even contradictory. For instance, earrings in the shape of bulls' heads - which were considered part of the "International Style" by Crowley because of the composite plants (No. 493) - are rejected by Feldman, since morphology and imagery of the bull-motif are typically Cypriot and distinct from any hybrid koine tradition (p. 201 n. 18). On the other hand, round ivory discs from Kition and Kouklia (cf. Feldman, figs. 20-23), which 14 Cf. S. Sherratt, Comment on Ora Negbi, The "Libyan landscape" from Thera: a review of Aegean enterprises overseas in the Late Minoan IA period, JMA 7 (1994) 237-238; A.B. Knapp, Review of S. Gitin (ed.), Recent excavations in Israel: a view to the West (Dubuque 1995), JAOS 117 (1997) 607; S.W. Manning, From process to people: longue duree to history, in: Cline/Harris-Cline (eds.), Aegean and Orient, 319. 15 It is difficult to understand Knapp who speaks - in the very same context - of "cultural distance", "otherness", "exotic", "iconographic koine", and "hybrid forms of elite art", yet con- cludes with an "international helleno-semitic, artistic koine of exotica and iconographica" (A.B. Knapp, Mediterranean Bronze Age trade: distance, power and place, in: Cline/Harris- Cline (eds.), Aegean and Orient, 195-198). 16 Cf. Fischer, UF 39 (2007) 869-875 tab. IV.</page><page sequence="5">244 Buchbesprechungen Feldman considers distinctly Cypriot (p. 43), are part of the koine, as are ivory combs in typical Mycenaean shape with lions and bulls (from Mycenae; cf. Feldman, pp. 46, 204 n. 67). This contradicts Feldman s definition of hybrid objects as being without traceable origin. Another example of inconsistency is an electrum signet-ring from Ugarit which has a winged lion in front of a composite plant.17 The object is excluded without reason (p. 8 1 ). At the same time, cosmetic-vessels and elements of toiletry are included because they have an "overt association with luxury" and elite status (p. 123). However, the desire for, and use of, cosmetics as well as jewellery was present in lower social classes, too, if only on a more modest scale. In Feldman's interpretation, it is not the type of object that is conclusive, but the material and execution. The large group of Ancient Near Eastern seals is also ignored by Feldman, although seals and their impressions convey images and artistic conventions over a wide area. The wall and floor paintings at Tell el-Daba, Malqata, Amarna, Nuzi, and Kar Tukulti- Ninurta form another category with important aspects that Feldman completely ex- cludes. Material: It comes as no surprise that gold is the prevalent metal among all koine artifacts mentioned by Feldman; bronze only occurs once (the well known axe from Semna (p. 214 n. 4; albeit from a child's grave at the Second Cataract) although there are quite a number of objects made of bronze that display the motifs of her artistic koine.18 Glass and faience are considered to be of equal value (pp. 117-1 18), to us an unjus- tified assumption. In Egypt, for instance, glass vessels were made in royal workshops,19 but they certainly could be found in elite graves of people who had nothing to do with international exchange. As for faience, objects such as amulets, rings, or little trinkets displaying "koine motifs" were widely distributed throughout various contexts. Man- ufactured in moulds, such objects were produced in large numbers. Only coloured faience-vessels were more luxurious, but sophisticated faience technology is known outside palace centers, such as Beth Shan.20 When dealing with ivory, Feldman follows Caubet's and Gachet's opinion of hip- popotamus ivory as being of lesser prestige than elephant ivory (pp. 10, 119).

We have found that the choice of material is often related to the type of object;21 moreover, carvings of hippopotamus ivory can be found in highly prestigious contexts such as the royal tomb of Kamid el-Loz.22 In any event, in many instances a determination of ivory-type has yet to be done. Similarly, it is an ill-founded assumption that all round or semi-round toilet boxes found in Egypt were made of hard (= luxury) woods (pp. 140-141). In fact, many objects were manufactured from locally available woods such as acacia or tamarisk. Those "cheaper" objects, however, employ the "koine" imagery too, and derive - where documented - from non-elite tombs 23 Motifs: We find a further problem when Feldman posits that certain motifs occur only on luxury items, as defined above. She points to dynamic battles between wild animals and "composite creatures", sometimes associated with anthropomorphic hunters. A second major group of motifs she favors is related to the composite plant which, in Feldman's view, is mainly symmetrical, occasionally paired with wild or fantastic creatures, and devoid of any narrative element. She finds narrative scenes are avoided in general (pp. 10, 30, 74, 207), and that common stylistic elements comprise an emphasis on contour, linear stylization of anatomical details, and framing patterns such as a spiral band, guilloche pattern, or rosettes (p. 57). Feldman's choice, however, is highly selective and corresponds to her interpretation of koine motifs as expressive of royal iconography, namely military prowess and control of natural forces (p. 13). Outside of her axiomatic definitions, it is difficult to understand why she includes hunting on foot but excludes the chariot hunt (pp. 65-67). Both contain a similar amount of narration or "non- narration" and depict single individuals 24 Another contradictory example is found among the ivories from Middle Assyrian Assur, tomb 45 (pp. 132-133; more explicit in her article, cf. n. 9). The author correctly acknowledges a common place of manufacture for a tall ivory pyxis and an ivory comb from that tomb, for these objects form a set, as others have noted. However, Feldman finds only the pyxis displaying an "unusual artistic connection to the koine", not the comb. The latter reveals "an entirely Assyrian character" according to Feldman, for its narrative composition displays a procession of women. Interestingly, besides the motif, one of Feldman s arguments to attribute the pyxis to her "koine" is its shape. That shape, however, is distributed all over the ancient world and is not particular to a Late Bronze Age privileged class.25 21 Wicke, Kleinfunde, 65-66. 22 E.

This line of argument clearly turns into another vicious circle.27 The concept ofhybridity: A major focus of Feldman's approach is hybridity as the major relevant and discriminating factor in her "international artistic koine" (pp. 60-62). Drawing upon results from biology and the human sciences, she transposes the idea of hybridity - in the sense of mixing "pure conditions" - into archaeology by proposing that interdynastic marriages - an intermingling of bloodlines - is analogous to the "International Style" as an intermingling of artistic traditions (a "biological reality", p. 70). Her final analogy of visual hybridity in costly objets d'art and biological hybridity brought about through interdynastic marriages is nothing but modern intellectual gedankenspielereiy far-fetched and without relation to the archaeological material. It can hardly be taken seriously.28 We have problems with this approach. Firstly, Feldman insinuates that many previous archaeologists used "hybrid" with a negative connotation,29 whereas "hybrid" is usually employed in a neutral and descriptive manner, denoting a composite or mixed state in objects, illustrations, cultural forms or traditions that is equivalent to German "misch-" or French "composite/mixte".30 Negative connotations of "hybrid" occur more often with respect to an opposition of originality versus copying,31 not aiming at "purity" versus "impurity". Based on an incorrect preconceived notion of a negative sense of hybridity among earlier scholars, Feldman writes: "The marginalization of iconographic 26 Cf. M.-H. Gates, Mycenaean art for a Levantine market? The ivory lid from Minet el Beidha/ Ugarit, in: R. Laffineur/J.L. Crowley (eds.), EIKON: Aegean Bronze Age iconography - shap- ing a methodology. Proceedings of the 4th international Aegean conference, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia, 6-9 April 1992, Aegaeum 8 (Li&amp;ge 1992) 77-84. 27 Feldman's bold description of a maritime entrepreneurial network in order to explain the cultural context of the lid is pure speculation. 28 Completely overdrawn is Feldman's conclusion towards a creation of composite creatures, which combine elements of various beings (lion, hawk, bull, human): "Drawn from creatures that are incommensurate, the various body parts coexist with one another in a precarious balance that seems to echo the uneasy relations among the Great Kings, who want and need to cohabit the international world, yet also maintain their peculiar ideologies of sovereignty within their own states." (p. 68) 29 She refers to the work of P. Demargne, Die Geburt der griechischen Kunst: die Kunst im agai- schen Raum von vorgeschichtlicher Zeit bis zum Anfang des 6. vorchristlichen Jahrhunderts (Munich 1965) - to whom she alleges even a colonialistic concept in the description of the Mycenaean sphere and - S. Wachsman, Aegeans in the Theban tombs, OLA 20 (Leuven 1987). Wachsman discusses the authenticity of depictions of foreigners in Theban tombs of the 18th dynasty, but applies the term "hybrid" as neutrally as possible and simply in the meaning of "mixed". 30 Cf. in particular H.J. Kantor, Plant ornament: its origin and development in the Ancient Near East (Diss., Univ. of Chicago 1945) 221: "South-flower hybrids" for a description of Egyptian composite plants; id., JNES 15 (1956) 166-167: "Hybrid Canaanite-Mycenaean Ivories"; Frankfort, Art and architecture, 269 describes composite sphinxes. 3 1 Mainly referring to later "Phoenician" art, e.g. E.M. de Vogue, Seance du 14 Juin, CRAIBL 23 (1895) 249 - an assumption that has characterized the appreciation of Iron Age Levantine art ever since. In more recent years the creative effort of the "Phoenicians" has become a focus of research, leading to a rethinking of "Phoenician" art in general.</page><page sequence="8">Buchbesprechungen 247 and minute stylistic analysis stemming from negative judgements of these pieces has caused subtle yet significant distinctions among the works to be overlooked, which in turn has led to less-than-consistent classifications" (p. 5). She thereby dismisses and discredits many former scholarly achievements. She also tends to confuse the categories of hybrid motifs and hybrid artistic traditions, when stating for example "... scholars generally consider these works decorative and, as such, empty of meaning. This latter belief is linked to a general assumption that 'hybrid' art, since not 'pure' or 'true', lacks coherence and significance" (p. 207 n. 1). A second problem with hybridity is that while Feldman states that for true koine ob- jects it is impossible "... to disentangle the separate threads of cultural indebtedness ..." (p. 24), she does little to investigate the situation in a thorough motivgeschichte , a basic art-historical method. Contrary to her position, we believe it is possible to disentangle a large number of threads, as many scholars have done in the study of origins for motifs such as sphinxes, griffins, and composite plants.32 In particular Feldman's treatment of sphinx and griffin is superficial and defective, with little reference to ancient Near Eastern art history and detailed studies. Neglecting the works of Kantor and Poursat, Feldman considers a number of objects that earlier were recognized as Mycenaean, Levantine, or Syrian for good reasons as "international koine". A third problem with Feldman's hybridity is that "International Style" motifs - with their general and generalized reference to kingship - embrace the "paired aspects of protection and benefaction" (pp. 13, 87). This notion maybe understood and acknowl- edged by all participants of the koine but is impossible to demonstrate. There is a long history of hunt and battle scenes in Egypt, the Ancient Near East, and the Aegean, and it is very difficult to be sure that formal similarity in motifs across regions corresponds to similarity of content. Very close attention needs to be paid to local variants and cultural differences across regions. It may be that Feldman recognizes alternative international traditions (pp. 67, 194), but she does not elaborate on this. Therefore we see a major flaw in Feldman's approach - reflective of her modernist thinking - in how such an artistic koine was created. She refers to the committee choice of a design for the new European currency (p. 6) that allows Euro-notes to represent European art history from Roman to modern times depicting imaginary bridges and facades. How could such a creative act be envisaged in antiquity? It is highly unlikely that the leading court artists accompanied by diplomats and specialists on "royal ideology" gathered together - maybe even sent by their patrons - to decide on forms of arts for international diplomatic exchange.

Her argument - artistic koine objects contributed to the creation of a 32 For example Poursat, Ivoires myceniens; not to forget contributions such as Kantor, Plant ornament; C.

The fact is that the koine motifs, as summarized above, are far too common and widely distributed across time, space, and media to fit Feldman's narrow bounds. Many items in fact do not come from royal or palatial contexts.33 Her correct observation that the artistic koine is a rather shore-based Eastern Mediterranean phenomenon in contrast to the rather inland Near Eastern phenomenon of the Amarna-correspondence (p. 144) should have raised her suspicions, but it remained without further comment. Behind this is a fundamental problem in Feldman's book, namely, that "Interna- tional Style" elements have no traceable origin. Quite often, this argument is employed when trying to avoid difficult art-historical investigations into the history of motifs. It reveals little familiarity with Egyptian and Levantine art and appears to be a simplifying excuse. To reduce the objects under consideration a priori to small-scale items made of precious materials with known provenance leads to an artificial selection fitting the preconceived assumptions. It simulates a small and coherent corpus but makes any further conclusions and interpretations highly speculative and disputable. There is yet another basic deficiency in the definition of koine objects as prestigious items for diplomatic gifts between "Great Kings". In order to explain "International Style" objects in Ugarit - which did not play a part in the league of Great Kings but was a Hittite vassal - Feldman suggests two possible interpretations in her concluding chapter: 1 ) koine objects also circulated among lower-ranking kings who imitated Great Kings, or 2) the king of Ugarit tried to raise his status by employing koine objects. As Feldman herself acknowledges, objects are ambiguous in their meaning and depend on context. They may represent gifts, tribute, booty, trading-goods, or simply locally manufactured goods, transmitting "oscillating valences" with "multiple superimposed meanings" (pp. 168-169). However, while Feldman uses this ambiguity when referring to non-equal relationship, she refrains from transposing her way of reasoning onto objects in diplomatic exchange. There are a large number of possible relationships between owner and donor, difficult to read from the object unless it is written on it, but impossible to use for extensive interpretation. In fact, tempting as it is to correlate "International style" objects and objects men- tioned in the "international correspondence", even Feldman admits that it is impossible to identify any such object (pp. 17, 164). 34 She omits the very interesting instance men- tioned in EA 14, II 11-14, where pharaoh sends a statue of himself, his wife, and his 33 Objects were found in association with sanctuaries such as the Artemision at Delos, the Egyptian temple-site of Tell Basta, and the Fosse Temple at Lachish. They have also been found in rich - but not necessarily royal - burials, as the tombs of Yuya and Tuyu, Mycenaean chamber tombs, Assur tomb 45, and various Cypriote tombs; cf.

Cochavi-Rainey, Royal gifts in the Late Bronze Age, fourteenth to thirteenth centuries B.C.E.: selected texts recording gifts to royal personages, Beer-Sheva 13 (Beer-Sheva 1999) 211-218; Feldman quotes Sherratt, JMA 7 (1994) 237-240 and Knapp, in: Cline/Harris- Cline (eds.), Aegean and Orient, 193-207, but misses E.

These images will certainly have been executed in Egyptian manner, with Egyptian costume, and regalia. The Egyptian court would not have con- sented to a neutral appearance according to latest "International Style" fashion in order to keep a political balance. A second instance is EA 27, 19-20 where Tushratta requests statues of himself and his daughter executed in pure gold from Egypt. It remains open to discussion whether Tushratta expected to receive the figures in Mittanian costumes and royal iconography - which presupposes Egyptian craftsmen being knowledgeable in that style - whether Tushratta was interested in an Egyptian version of his image - which may have contained some "exotic aesthetic quality" - or whether he was simply interested in gold. In the end, Feldman diminishes many achievements of earlier scholars at the same time that she fails to advance the definition of a more coherent corpus of "International Style" objects. She stays within the circular argument outlined at the beginning of her research and thus comes to her assumed conclusion. It needs to be stressed, for example, that it is neither true nor legitimate to interpret the koine motifs exclusively as part of royal iconography. When describing koine objects as a "combination of a contextually determined classification of objects and the indeterminacy of visual associations, within a system of highly formalized conventions," (p. 190) the question remains of who is giving evidence to any classification and contextualization. With respect to the book under review, it is Feldman. For a long time the concept of "International Style" has generally been accepted and used uncritically and in different ways. Recently, a detailed study of the use of the term "International Style" in Near Eastern archaeology was offered by A. Lanaro, and she concludes that we must give up that term completely.35 It is our strong belief that the concept of "International Style" is far too vague a term to be used to evaluate cultural contact. It cannot contribute to an explanation of the exchange mechanism taking place in the major and minor arts during the 2nd millennium BC, and - lacking a solid definition in itself - needs further inquiries. Feldman s claim to give a new definition and interpretation of the phenomenon called "International Style" by a multidisciplinary approach initially raises high expec- tations but fails to fulfil.
