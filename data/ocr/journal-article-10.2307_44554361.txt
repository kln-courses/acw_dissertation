<plain_text><page sequence="1">650474 Recent Developments in Penetration Resistance of Windshield Glass J. C. Widman Ford Motor Co. THE SAE AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY GLAZING MANUAL states, "The term safety glass means safety glazing materials pre- dominantly ceramic in character, so constructed, treated or combined with other materials as to reduce, in comparison with ordinary sheet glass or plate glass, the likelihood of in- jury to persons by objects from exterior sources or by these safety glazing materials when they may be cracked or bro- ken." (1)* The adoption of safety glass in automobiles in the 1920's was one of the earliest innovations in the growing campaign for traffic safety. The glass used prior to this time was an- nealed plate; it was structurally so weak that one had to use care when closing the car doors because the glass often shat- tered from such impact. In addition, moderately light con- tact with the glass by a passenger would produce lacerations, and in most cases, such lacerations would be more severe than that warranted by the seriousness of the accident. There- fore, when laminated safety glass was introduced, it was hailed as a major step in the vehicle safety field. Unfortunately, a wide assortment of glass was introduced, and the properties were so varied that the beneficial effects of adopting safety glass were often discounted by adverse results. Many organizations, including local and state gov- * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. emmental agencies attempted to write specifications for the new glass which made it virtually impossbile for the manu- facturers to meet all of the various requirements. The American Standard Safety Code, for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways, was introduced in 1935 as a tentative standard. The code was written under the auspices of the American Standards Association and in conjunction with many author- itative organizations, including the SAE. It became an ap- proved standard in 1938. The publication of this document and its recognition by the majority of agencies established uniformity in the Safety Glazing field. This ASA Code, which standardized specifi- cations and test methods, succeeded in establishing, a product that has been accepted throughout the United Statesand Can- ada. Today, this code is incorporated into the statutes of many of the states and provinces. Two types of safety glass are commonly used in vehicles today; tempered safety glass is used in side and back win- dows of United States products and in all locations in many foreign cars; and laminated safety glass is required in wind- shields of domestic and foreign vehicles operated in the United States, primarily to insure visibility in this critical area. Both types have advantages and disadvantages. Tempered safety glass minimizes the potential of serious lacerations, in that when it breaks, it has relatively dull edges and a small ABSTRACT A twofold improvement in penetration resistance of lam- inated safety glass for use in vehicle windshields has been achieved.

Its main disadvantage is that sometimes, when it is struck by a sharp object and broken, the crazing effect produced by the small particle size results in the loss of trans- parency. Although the broken glass can readily be pushed out thus restoring visibility, the momentary loss of visibility may be critical in a windshield while it would not be else- where. The advantage of laminated safety glass is that when it is cracked, it results in only slight visibility loss. However, the broken edges are very sharp and as a result, serious facial lacerations can occur to the driver or passengers during an accident. These pros and cons have been debated in safety and technical papers and meetings for several years but wide- spread experience in the field indicates that the use of lam- inated safety glass in windshields and tempered safety glass elsewhere offers the best safety combination and the new laminated glass improves the overall efficiency of the com- bination. Ideally, the glazing material should be hard surfaced to resist abrasion from cleaning and windshield wiper operation and, to minimize injury, it should either crumble into small pieces with dull edges (such as tempered safety glass) or it should provide a yielding surface to minimize penetration. In addition, for windshields there should be a minimum loss of visibility when the glass is shattered. In the Fall of 1962, the SAE Glazing Committee reviewed a paper published by Dr. G . Rodloff of Deutsch Tafelglas of Germany. Dr. Rodloff stated that the resistance to penetra- tion could be improved in laminated glass by increasing the moisture content of the interlayer. (2) It has been the practice of American glass manufacturers to hold the moisture content of the interlayer to less than 0.5%. This has provided a high degree of adhesion of glass to interlayer and excellent weathering properties. It was agreed by the SAE Glazing Committee that improved pene- tration resistance was desirable and could be achieved by loosening the glass to interlayer bond slightly. However, prer vious experience has shown that increased moisture content would cause premature aging and poor weathering properties. Since excellent aging and weathering properties had been an outstanding feature of American -made laminated glass for many years, most glass authorities were reluctant to de- part from this position. Accordingly, the plastic interlayer manufacturers were asked to study the possibility of developing a new material that would contain the same moisture, while at the same time would improve the penetration resistance without im- pairing any of the existing desirable properties. The SAE Glazing Committee established the performance standards based on the force involved when the occupant of a vehicle contacts the windshield during an accident. The plastics companies supplied the test materials to the lami- natore, who in tum provided flat test samples and windshields to the car manufacturers for evaluation. ASA physical strength tests are based primarily upon the 1/2 lb ball, the 7 oz dart, and the 111b shot bag, falling spe- cified distances and impacting a 12 x 12 in. glass specimen. These tests were originally devised as a means for quality control and have served well over the years to determine whether or not a manufacturer's material and process would meet the required ASA standard. Fig. 1 shows the ASA Code Impacting Test Items. There is little correlation however, between these tests and the primary consideration, that is, that of the human head coming in violent contact with the windshield glass. Therefore, an investigation was initiated to develop a test- ing device that would be reasonably accurate in representing the situation encountered in an automobile accident involv- ing a windshield. The primary objective was to develop a windshield material which would be at least twice as pene- tration resistant as the existing windshield glass without im- pairing any of its present qualities, such as spalling, separa- tion or increasing the deceleration forces. The desired result was expressed in car speed -- that is, mph. The test sample size was selected as 2 x 3 ft since this would be representative of one -half of a windshield in most Fig. 1 - ASA code impact test items</page><page sequence="3">PENETRATION RESISTANCE OF WINDSHIELD GLASS 657 standard size American cars. See Fig. 2. This piece of glass was to be impacted by a "headform". This headform weighs 221b, which represents the weight of the human head and a portion of the upper torso, the total weight which would be impacted against the windshield. The headform is cov- Fig. 2 - SAE laminated glass test device ered with a synthetic mbber to simulate the scalp and has an instrument cavity within the headform sphere. The edge of the glass test piece is held between sponge rubber strips, but is not cemented in place. The edge of the test frame must be held by weights or clamps to prevent any pulling inward of the glass edge during impact. This clamping force will vary, depending upon the glass or mbber surfaces and other factors, but it has been found to have little effect on the results as long as the glass test piece is substantially re- tained in the test frame. The upper portion of the test fix- ture is removable for loading and unloading and a centering device is located at the bottom f or properly locating the fixture in relationship to the tower. The glass test sample in Fig. 3 was constmcted with the present standard interlayer material 0.015 in. thick. The 22 lb headform was dropped 2.5 ft, equivalent to 8.5 mph. The break is typical of many automobile windshields after hav- ing been impacted by an occupant's head during an acci- dent. Note that there are relatively few cracks and that the hole in the glass is reasonably circular in shape, correspond- ing to the size and shape of the headform. The hole has been punched out quite cleanly which would allow a passenger's head to pass through and come in contact with the sharp edges of the glass. In many accidents, the vehicles do not come to an im- mediate rest. In such cases, the vehicle is lurching over curbs, through ditches, and in general, gyrating in an uncon- trolled fashion, causing repeated contacts between the pas- senger and the edge of the broken glass. Fig. 4 shows the test results of laminated safety glass con- structed with the new vinyl interlayer material 0.030 in. thick. Fig. 3 - Standard 0.015 in. interlayer - 2.5 ft drop (8.5 mph)</page><page sequence="4">658 J. C. WIDMAN The drop was from 22 ft, corresponding to an impact speed of 25.6 mph. The 221b headform contacted the glass in the center, as indicated by the large mass of cracks, but it did not break through the glass. Note also that the entire area of the test sample shows extensive Cracking, which indicates that the impact load was spread over a larger area, produc- ing a lower unit loading. In contrast , upon striking the standard interlayer, the head- form will crack only a small amount of glass and, the high degree of bond between the glass and the interlayer causes ruptures in the interlayer early in the breaking process, al- lowing the headform to penetrate the glass. In samples with the thicker interlayer material, the glass will crack extensively, but due to the thicker interlayer and the slightly modified bond, a small portion of the interlayer material can detach from the glass and allow greater elonga - tion of the interlayer, which is a desired result. As the head - form progressively penetrates the glass plane, more and more cracks form outwardly from the point of impact, each crack in tum providing more elastic material available to stretch. This mechanism can be seen in Fig. 5. Thus, two factors account for the higher penetration re- sistance of the new windshield glass. The first is the in- creased thickness of the interlayer material, 0.030 in. instead of 0.01 5 in. and the second is the controlled adhesion quality of the interlayer. In combination, these two factors create a more flexible and penetration resistant glass assembly when impacted. Fig. 6 illustrates the overall improvement that is obtained by using the thicker improved, interlayer. The bar at the left indicates the test results using glass constructed with standard production polyvinyl butyral 0.015 in. thick. The drop height of the headform was equivalent to 8.5 mph. The second bar represents the new material of the same thickness, 0.015 in. The improved material of the same thickness did increase the speed required for penetration to approximately 12 mph. The third bar represents the test results from test samples of laminated glass with 0.030 in. standard interlayer mate- rial. This provided approximately the same degree of im- provement as the new material only half as thick. In the fourth test set, the penetration resistance was greatly improved, as indicated by the final bar.

The 22mph penetration speed will vary with different test samples, but it is believed to be sufficiently conservative for a tentative minimum standard. Moisture content and temperature are two variables which must be closely controlled during the laminating process. Residual moisture in the interlayer has an effect upon the adhesive properties of the new polyvinyl butyral laminated glass. This, in turn, has an effect upon the mean break height. The most common way in which adhesion is tested in the laminated glass industry is by the "pummel" or "crush" test. Laminated glass samples are chilled to 0 F and then beaten with a ball -peen hammer for observation of the amount of glass retained on the interlayer. Results are compared to master samples and ratings applied from 1 through 10. Rat- ings of 3 and below are considered deficient, while a rating of about 6 is desirable.

The samples from which the low "pummel" values were obtained have too much moisture in the interlayer and would result in poor weathering. The central area of the chart indicates reason- able "pummel" values and will correlate with the test data that follows. You will note from the caption that the impact tests were conducted using a 51b ball and 12 x 12 in. glass samples, not the SAE headform. It is customary, when evaluating a material to check it at room temperature and both higher and lower than room temperature. (OF and 120 F are usually chosen.) Existing equipment in the glass plants would only accommodate the standard ASA 12 x 12 in. test size, not the much larger 2 x 3 ft SAE test samples. Accordingly, a test using the smaller ASA glass samples was desirable to avoid delays in the test program. It was found that a 5 lb steel ball, used with the standard ASA test size glass, provided test results which correlate well with results from the new SAE test using a 221b headform and 2 x 3ft test samples. The conformity of the two tests will be shown in a later exhibit. A graph showing the relationship of the height of drop of the SAE headform versus moisture content is shown in Fig. 8. For comparison purposes, the chart also includes plots repre- senting the performance of the standard interlayer material in different thicknesses (4). The dotted line designated as 15 mil standard interlayer extends nearly horizontally across the chart, indicating that moisture content has little effect on glass performance, as measured by the mean break height. When the interlayer is increased in thickness, as shown on the plot marked "30 mil standard interlayer", a corre- sponding increase in the break height occurs. However, there is a negligible effect as a result of the moisture content of the material. The new interlayer material, however, shows a far differ- ent reaction to moisture content.

C. WIDMAN material. Starting at the left, it is noted that low moisture content does not affect the physical properties of the new material any more than the 30 mil standard vinyl interlayer. However, at approximately 0.2% moisture, there is a substan- tial gain in the mean break height. In the area of 0.5-0.6% this gain levels off and approaches a constant value. It is probable that the laminatore will confine the mois- ture to the central portion of the curve for optimum results. Below these values, the adhesion of the glass to the inter- layer is too high, and a lower breaking strength is exhibited. Above these values, adhesion may be lowered, and weather- ing qualities may be adversely affected. Both the standard and the improved interlayer materials exhibit physical variations due to temperature at the time of impact. Maximum benefits occur at approximately 7 OF, with some deterioration at both cold and elevated tempera- tures. Composition of the interlayer can be altered to favor one end of the scale or the other, but previous practice within the industry has been to use a material which is fairly well balanced, with approximately equivalent results at OF and 120F. The test results in Fig. 9 are those obtained when the mean break height was compared to temperature variation (3). These tests were all made on the 2 x 3ft SAE test sam- ples. The bottom line depicts the results obtained with lam- inated glass made with 0.015 in. standard interlayer. The slight peak in the central portion of the line at 70 F coincides with a mean break height of 2.5 ft, equivalent to about 8.5 mph. Some dropping off occurs at the ends of the curve, which is characteristic, as previously mentioned. The two lines in the center of the chart represent a stand - ard interlayer of 0.030 in. thick and an improved interlayer 0.015 in. thick. As discussed earlier, you will note that the 70 F points coincide, with the temperature extremities drop- ping down some in mean break height. Also, the chart shows that the improved interlayer drops more rapidly than the standard material at each end. The upper curve in the chart shows the test results on glass laminated with the new inter- layer material. The peak at 70 F coincides closely with pre- vious data, and shows the fine improvements over the lower curves. At each end of the temperature scale, there is, again, an appreciable drop off, but in no case is the mean break height reduced below the present material. As measured by 8 to 1, while at OF and 120 F the improvement is about 4 to 1.

Wayne State University conducted a series of tests on both types of windshields. There were two important considera- tions to be investigated. First, was the lacera tive potential of the new glass improved, and, second, would the decelera- tion forces be low enough? Wayne State University's Biomechanic Research Depart- ment is one of the foremost investigation centers in this coun- try on the subject of human tolerance to impact forces. Their equipment is extensive and modern, and their medical and engineering schools have cooperated closely in tests and inter- pretations. Fig. 10 shows the test arrangement which was used to as- sess the effect of the windshield glass on occupants. A body front end assembly was used to mount the windshields. The windshields were securely fastened with metal clips and were not allowed to detach from the mounting when impacted . This imposed the most severe conditions on the test glass, since any detachment of the glass would have lowered the impact and deceleration forces. The test subject is shown seated in a conventional automobile seat, mounted on a sled. The sled is projected forward and when it is in the ap- propriate relationship to the windshield, the sled is abruptly 200 rir i i i i O CIRCLED POINTS INDICATE HEAD PENETRATION OF GLASS ,s° 1 1 I 15 MIL STANDARD &gt;, ¡ HEAD WINDSHIELD !

C. WIDMAN stopped and the test subject (not restrained by a seat belt) is catapulted into the windshield. The test is believed equiva- lent in severity to a frontal impact into a barrier. Note the instruments mounted on the rear of the test subject's head and the numerous high speed motion picture cameras and associated equipment. The results of these tests have been reassuring. Deceler- ation forces are reduced at all impact speeds below pene- tration when compared to the standard windshield (5). The results of Wayne State testing are shown in Fig. 11 (6). It should be noted that as soon as the windshield glass is penetrated by the subject's head, the deceleration forces increase. This is caused by the head contacting the edge of the broken glass, which results in a much higher loading than that caused by the flat surface. This is particularly no- ticeable in the case of the 0.030 in. improved windshield glass. Deceleration forces are quite low until breakthrough occurs, and then the forces reach a level equal to the stand- ard interlayer material. The possibilities of severe facial lacerations are also reduced with the improved windshields, since penetration does not occur until much higher speeds are reached. Fig. 12 shows a graphic comparison of the two materials (5). The left hand group of three photos is of the present pro- duction windshield material, while the right hand group is with the new improved glass. The top pair of photos were taken at an impact speed of 8mph, the centerpairat 14mph, and the lower pair at 24mph. In frontal impacts, the dum- my's head usually enters the glass at a point rather high on the windshield and then proceeds downward in the plane of the glass, as the torso rotates about the hip joint. Severe facial damage usually results. With the new glass material, breakthrough does not occur at these test speeds because of its increased penetration resistance. This means that at rela- tive head speeds up to 24mph, in a frontal impact, an occu- pant would probably sustain only superficial head cuts. At higher speeds» however, the possibility of lacerative in- jury should be about the same with both types of interlayer. The new interlayer has no noticeable effect on the optical properties of the windshield. Both laboratory and "in car" tests have indicated satisfactory results and comformance to all optical standards. Manufacturing and field experience with the new inter- layer material is incomplete, but thus far has proven to be excellent. Revisions in processing are required; accurate moisture control is necessary, and the proper equipment to provide this control constitutes the biggest plant revisions. Additional storage facilities are also required due to the greater bulk of the new interlayer material. The Cornell Automotive Crash Injury Research statistics, published in 1962, show windshield glass to be responsible for about 15% of all automobile injuries (7). Now that all cars are equipped with seat belts, the rate of injury attribut- able to the windshield will certainly be substantially re- duced. A reserve could be provided by this new develop- ment which would benefit persons in severe accidents who fail to wear seat belts, and for those who come in contact with the windshield, despite the wearing of seat belts. In conclusion, as Chairman of the SAE Glazing and Stand- ards Committee, I should note that this program, as with other SAE technical programs undertaken in the public in- terest, has had the effective support of all parties involved. Their cooperation in this program has been outstanding. REFERENCES 1. "Automotive Safety Glazing Manual - SAE J906." Pub- lished by Society of Automotive Engineers, March, 1965. 2. Dr. G.

PATRICK Wayne State University RESEARCH ON INJURY POTENTIAL of automotive glazing was initiated at Wayne State University in 1958 with a re- search project to compare the injury potential of tempered and laminated side windows in automobiles. The results of this program showed that tempered glass is not likely to cause more head injuries than the laminated glass (1).* This was contrary to the predictions of those opposed to the use of tempered glass as they felt the increased strength of the glass would cause concussion and internal head injury. The va- lidity of this conclusion has been proven by statistical ev- idence of accidents involving both types of glass (2). These investigators can find no significant difference in the injury production from the two types of side windows. The extensive development program undertaken jointly by the automobile, glass, and plastic industries resulted in a windshield which had a substantially higher penetration *N um bers in parentheses designate References at end of discussion.</page><page sequence="9">PENETRATION RESISTANCE OF WINDSHIELD GLASS 663 velocity than the standard windshield as evidenced by labor- atory experiments using a 22 lb headform and explained in Mr. Widmanłs paper. While the laboratory test with a metal headform resulted in a considerable improvement, the use of the new windshield could have side effects that would be undesirable. A research program was initiated at Wayne State University involving human cadavers in experiments more nearly simulating accident conditions. The laboratory device has been described briefly in Mr. Widman's paper and in more detail by Patrick and Daniel (3). The main ob- jectives of the research program were to: 1. Establish penetration velocity for the standard and ex- perimental windshields. 2. Compare the injury potential of the two types of wind- shields. 3. Compare test results of cadavers and anthropomorphic dummies. Table A presents a comparison of the penetration results for the WSU program and the SAE tests. The WSU penetra- tion velocities in the table are head -to glass velocities which are somewhat higher than the sled speed. For exam- ple, the penetration velocity for the 30 mil HI laminate wind- shield is 29.3mph, while the sled velocity was actually 22.7 mph. The head velocity at impact is greater than the sled velocity due to the jackknifing effects when the knees of the cadaver hit the instrument panel. The drop height listed in Table A for the WSU tests is a calculated value which will provide the head -to-glass velocity given in the table. The higher penetration velocities for both types of wind- shields can be attributed to one or more of the following: 1. The SAE headform may be too heavy. The SAE head- form weighs 221b, while the human head weighs about 11- 141b. Apparently, the 221b headform makes allowance for a contribution of the neck and torso to the equivalent head weight. The added weight could be too high. 2. The mounting conditions are different. In the SAE test fixture the glass is mounted in a rigid frame, while in the vehicle the glass is mounted in a less rigid frame. Also, the SAE test is conducted with a flat laminate, while the WSU tests are conducted with curved windshields. 3. The impact angle is different for the SAE and WSU tests. In the SAE tests, the headform strikes the glass in a direction perpendicular to it, while in the WSU tests ( and in real accidents) the head strikes the windshield at an angle. 4. The metal headform has different physical character- istics than the human head. While there is a significant difference between the pene- tration velocities found by the two test methods, the SAE method is conservative and is desirable from the standpoint of reproducibility, ease of testing, and cost of equipment. Injury potential was found to be about the same for the two types of glass at the subpenetration level and after pen- etration occurred. The difference is the velocity at which penetration does occur. At subpenetration levels the injuries were contusions, abrasions, gouges, and minor lacerations. After penetration occurred, severe lacerations and fractures of the facial bones were observed. The marked increase in penetration velocity will result in injuries being scaled down. At speeds where penetration would occur with the standard glass they will not occur with the improved wind- shield, and consequently the injuries will be in the less ser- ious category. Penetration to the forehead resulted in skin flaps which are commonly observed by accident investigators. Deeper penetrations cause fractures of the zygoma, maxilla, zygo- matic arch, rim of the orbit, and nasal bones. Comparison of results from dummies and cadavers showed that dummies can be used for establishing penetration speed, but are of little value in evaluating injuries. Additional work will have to be done to calibrate the dummies for in- jury measurements. Barrier -type conditions are simulated in the WSU impact sleds; that is, the barrier -type accident in which the vehicle is stopped before the passenger strikes its interior. This is the most severe type of accident and corresponds to car to Table A - Comparison of SAE and Wayne State University Windshield Tests Standard Windshield Experimental Windshield (15 mil laminate) (30 mil Ml) SAE Drop WSU (Cadaver) SAE Drop WSU (Cadaver) Variable Test Sled Test Test Sled Test Penetration 8.5 14. ia 25.6 29.3a velocity, mph Drop height, ft 2.5 6.6 22.0 28. 3^ a Relative head -to-glass velocity. b Drop height is calculated to produce the equivalent velocity.</page><page sequence="10">664 J. C. WIDMAN car accidents of considerably higher speeds. Muscle resist- ance will also increase the vehicle speed corresponding to the head to glass penetration velocity. Thus, the sled speed of 22.7 mph, at which penetration of the improved wind- shield occurred, might correspond to a car to car side impact collision in which the impacting vehicle is traveling at 45 mph or higher if the passenger anticipates the accident and braces himself in the vehicle. The significance of the improved windshield can be il- lustrated by statistics from ACIR (2) shown in Table B. Widespread use of the improved windshield will tend to move the injuries to a less serious category -- some fatal to dangerous, some dangerous to nondangerous, some non- dangerous to minor, and some minor to no injury. Most im- provement is expected in the nondangerous category. In or- der to provide an indication of the meaning of the nondangerous injury, the criteria used by ACIR are as follows: 1. "Deep" or "disfiguring" lacerations. 2. Extensive lacerations without dangerous hemorrhage. 3. Compound, comminuted fractures of nose. 4. Concussion with unconsciousness 5-30 minutes. No evidence of other intracranial injury. 5. Skull fracture without evidence of concussion or other intracranial injury. 6. Loss of eye. Although these injuries are not likely to cause death, those who suffer them are often disfigured and require extensive medical care. The criteria are listed to emphasize that "non- dangerous" may be interpreted differently by different peo- ple. A significant number of injuries will undoubtedly be moved up one or more categories toward the minor injury Table B - Casualties Attributed to Windshield (1964 estimated) Minor injuries 71. 2% 170,000 Nondangerous 25.0 % 60,000 Dangerous 2.7 % 6,500 Fatal 1.1% 2,700 100.0% 240,000 level. This will result in an important contribution to auto- mobile safety. It is hoped that development work will be continued to improve windshields still further. An increase in the pene- tration velocity to 35 -40 mph, if it can be achieved without causing closed head injury, will reduce the number of wind- shield casualties still further. REFERENCES 1. A. L.
