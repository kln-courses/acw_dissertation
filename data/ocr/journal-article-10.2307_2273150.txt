Let PO be the subsystem of Peano arithmetic obtained by restricting induc- tion to bounded quantifier formulas. Let M be a countable, nonstandard model of PO whose domain we suppose to be the standard integers. Let Tbe a recursively enumerable extension of Peano arithmetic all of whose existential consequences are satisfied in the standard model. Then there is an initial segment M' of M which is a model of T such that the complete diagram of M' is Turing reducible to the atomic diagram of M. Moreover, neither the addition nor the multiplication of M is recursive. The language of arithmetic is the first order predicate calculus with equality and with function symbols for addition, multiplication and successor, a constant symbol for zero and a relation symbol for "less than". The class of 28-formulas or bounded quantifier formulas is defined as the smallest class containing all atomic formulas, closed under propositional connectives and under bounded quantification: Vx (x &lt; y -+ 0), 3x (x &lt; y A 0). We set 110 = :8, and proceeding by induction, we define a Z?+i-formula to be one of the form 3x* 3x. 0 where 0 is no and a JIf+1-formula to be one of the form Vxj ... Vxv, 0 where 0 is T.0. By 2:-induction we mean the theory axiomatized by the defining properties of the primitive notions: Vx(x' # 0) VxVy(x' = -y x = y), Vx(x + 0 = x) VxVy(x + y' = (x + y)'), Vx(x 0 = 0) VxVy(x y' = x-y + x), VxVy (x &lt; y a: 3z(z O 0 A x + z = y)) together with the induction scheme for T:r-formulas Vx1 ... VxX[Ii0(0, xi, ... x") A (Vx(0(x, x1, *. x") 0(x', x1, x.)))] -* Vx0(x, x1, x)J], 0 in T:r. First order Peano arithmetic is then the union of the theories 10-induction, r = 0, 1, 2. In 28-induction, we can prove that addition and multiplication are associative and commutative and that the distributivity law holds; one can also show that &lt; defines a total strict linear ordering. The set N of the natural numbers together with the usual operations is a model of Peano arithmetic and is called the standard Received July 2, 1979; revised November 7, 1980. 403 ? 1982, Association for Symbolic Logic 0022-4812/82/4702-0012/$02.30</page><page sequence="2">404 KENNETH MCALOON model; a model of 28-induction which is not isomorphic to Nis called nonstandard. If M is a nonstandard model of 28-induction, the standard integers can be em- bedded in N as a proper initial segment; in this case we write N &lt; M; and, in general, if I is a proper initial segment of M we write I &lt; M. Also, if a, b e M and aEI &lt; Mbutb I,wewritea &lt; I&lt; b. Suppose M is a nonstandard model of 2O-induction and suppose F(x, al, ..., ak) is a 2O-formula with parameters a1, ..., a, k from M. Then if M ,= F(n, a1, ..., ak) for all standard n, we must have M k= F(a, a,, . . ., ak) for some nonstandard integer a in M. We refer to this phenomenon as overspill. Conversely, if E(x, a1, ..*, ak) is Mo and if M l= E(a, a1, ..*, a,,) for all nonstandard a, then M k= E(n, a1, ..., ak) for some standard n; this phenomenon is referred to as underspill. In this paper we shall study countable models of TO-induction for r &gt; 0 from the point of view of their complexity in the terms of recursion theory. So henceforth we say that a model M is given by two ternary relations on N denoted AddM, MultM, two binary relations denoted SuccM, OrdM and a distinguished integer denoted OM such that AddM and MultM are the graphs of total functions of two arguments and SuccM is the graph of a total function of one argument. If M is a nonstandard model of 28-induction, then OrdM has order type w + (w* + w),y and so OrdM and SuccM can be recursive relations on N. As we shall see this cannot be the case for AddM or MultM. We need one further definition before stating our main result. If I &lt; M we say that satisfaction in I is Turing reducible to M if the predicate a,, . . ., ak e I and I h F(a1, . . ., ak) on sequences of integers and formulas is Turing computable in the oracles AddM and MultM. The rest of this paper consists for the most part of proof of the following. THEOREM. Let Mbe a nonstandard model of B8-induction and let T be a recursively enumerable extension of Peano arithmetic all of whose existential consequences are satisfied in the standard model N; then (i) there is an initial segment I of M such that N &lt; I &lt; M, I is a model of T and satisfaction in I is Turing reducible to M; (ii) neither AddM nor Multm is recursive. REMARK. J. Quinsey has made two observations on strengthening part (i) of the main theorem. First, it is not necessary to assume that the given theory Textend full Peano arithmetic: it is sufficient that T extend TO-induction; at the very end of this paper we indicate how to emend our proof to get the stronger result by using results of Solovay [P, bis] and Dimitracopoulos [D]. Second, the initial segment I can be found so as to be a recursively saturated model of T; this is done by using the indicators of [K, Mc, M] in place of those of [K, P] and [K] in the proof of Proposition 2 below. REMARK. Part (ii) of the main theorem extends a well-known result of Ten- nenbaum which is usually stated to the effect that a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic cannot have both recursive addition and recursive multiplication. Kreisel observed in [E, K] that Tennenbaum's method could be used to show that the addition of such models is never recursive and this observation can also be made for multiplication. Lipshitz and Nadel [L, N] extend Tennenbaum's technique</page><page sequence="3">THE COMPLEXITY OF MODELS OF ARITHMETIC 405 and show that the addition of a model of Peano arithmetic is in fact recursively saturated. It can also be shown, using [C] for example, that the multiplication of a model of Peano arithmetic is recursively saturated. Examination of the proofs shows, moreover, that these last two results hold for models of 20-induction; what we do to obtain (ii) above is to combine Tennenbaum's technique with part (i) of the main theorem, cf. Proposition 3 below and the discussion following it. As for recursive saturation, in [C, Mc, W] it is shown that the addition of a model of 28-induction is, in fact, recursively saturated and that the multiplication is in models with exponentiation. Other results related to those here have been obtained by Paris, by Solovay and by Wilkie; and Macintyre has shown [Mac] that the finite fields Fp of a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic with p an infinite prime cannot have both recursive addition and recursive multiplication. REMARK. This paper owes a great deal to conversations we have had with George Wilmers. The ingredients of the proof of the main theorem include ideas of Kirby and Paris [K, P], [K], results of Paris and Harrington [P, H], [P], and, of course, the work of Tennenbaum [T] as well as results of H. Friedman [F] and Gaifman [G]. PROPOSITION 1. Let r be a nonnegative integer and let M be a nonstandard model of 28-induction. Then there is an initial segment I &lt; M which is a nonstandard model of 2O-induction. PROOF. First we note that there is a finite subsystem P1, ..., P. of Peano arithmetic such that /Xl&lt;i&lt;m Pi F- ZO-induction (cf. [Mc] for example). We can suppose that P1, ..., P7 are the defining properties of the basic notions and that P8, ..., Pmo are instances of the induction scheme. For 1 &lt; m &lt; mo - 7, let Pm+7 be VX1 ... VXh W0m(O x1 X.*.** XM) A Vxm(km(xm, xm, xM) m(Xm + 1, xM, ..., xM)) VXmOm(Xm, xM, ..., XM Set 31/m to be the prenex normal form of Om; so 3I/m is of the form Qmum ... Q mum Fm(Xm, xm, ... . x . um, ... * ) where Qm is either V or 3 and Fm is quantifier-free. We next set 3P* to be Qmum &lt; VM ... QmUm &lt; VfmFm. So the formula 3ITm is 2O with free variables vjm, ..., VkM, xm, xm, ..., xm. For O &lt; s &lt; kwe set Yr* to be Qm+ us+, &lt; vs+l ... Qmum &lt; vmFm( Xm, .x.*, UlM ... *, um). So Yr*mO = Yr* and r*= F mO m m~km- Recall that (x, y) -+ (x + y)2 + X is a pairing function for integers so that s = (b + (c + d)2 + c)2 + b expresses that s codes the ordered triple (b, c, d) = (b, (c, a)). When s codes the triple (b, c, d), we also can consider s as a code for a sequence of integers of length b; for i &lt; b, the ith term of this sequence, denoted (s)i, is defined as follows:</page><page sequence="4">406 KENNETH MCALOON ) r ifc= ((i + I)-d + I)g + rwithr &lt; (i + I)d + 1, ' " {O otherwise. It is well known that every finite sequence of integers can be coded in this way. So we introduce a 28-formula Seq(v) to express that v is a "properly functioning" code for a sequence number. Seq(v) 3b, c, d &lt; v [[v = (b + (c + d)2 + b)2 + b A Vb', c', d' &lt; v (v = (b' + (c' + d')2 + b') + b' = b A c' = c A d' = d)] A Vi &lt; b 3x &lt; v 3g &lt; v [(c = ((i + 1)-d + 1) g + x) Ax&lt;(i+ I)-d+ IAVx'&lt;vVg'&lt;v(x'&lt;(i+I)d+1 A c = ((i + I)d + 1) g' + x' -+ x' = x)]]. By a set of diagonal indiscernibles for a formula F(x1, ..., xt, Ut+1, ..., u, v1, ... I vk) we mean a set X c M such that for all e e X and for all pairs e1 &lt; ... &lt; ek, e &lt; ... &lt; ek of increasing sequences drawn from X with e &lt; e1, el we have (*) Ml h Va1, . . .,a &lt; e(F(a1, . . ., a,, e1, . . .,ek) +F(al, I *ai, e) .) . e We claim that for given F and infinite X c N there exists infinite H c X such that H consists of diagonal indiscernibles for F: in fact, partition [X]2k+1 into two classes by setting P(e, el, ..., el) equal to (*) if condition (*) obtains and equal to (**) otherwise. By the Infinite Form of Ramsey's Theorem, there exists H c X infinite and homogeneous for P. Let us verify that P is constantly (*) on H. For if not, then set eo = min H and define a partition of [H - {eo}]2k into (eO + I)i classes by setting Q(e1, ..., e*, e1, ..., e*) equal to the least sequence a,, ..., a, &lt; eo such that a1, ..., aj witnesses the failure of condition (*). Let K be infinite and homogeneous for Q and suppose Q is constantly equal to b1, .. ., bi on K; one reaches a contradiction by considering three sequences e1 &lt; ... &lt; ek &lt; el &lt; * ** &lt; el &lt; e' * &lt; e' drawn from K. Hence P is constantly (*) on H and it is easily seen that H is then a set of diagonal indiscernibles for F. Let us say that a set Y c M is closed for addition and multiplication if a, b E Y and a &lt; b imply a + a &lt; b and a * a &lt; b. Clearly there are infinite sets H c N &lt; M closed for addition and multiplication. Fix an infinite integer a in M. We want to express the following property in a 28-way: y &lt; a A 3 v &lt; a (v is a sequence of length y of diagonal indiscernibles for 1*0 1 ** ,k ' 70 * ' *o-7,km0-7 closed for addition and multiplica- tion and (v)O ? y). If this is accomplished for an infinite integer a this property will hold for all finite n and by "overspill" for 28-formulas this property will hold for some non- standard a e M; the sequence of length a of indiscernibles will then determine a model of P1, ...

By our previous remarks, we have M l= E(a, a) for some infinite a; so let s be such that M t= E(a, s). We have M l= n &lt; (s)o for all standard n. We now define I such that N &lt; I &lt; M by setting x E I F x &lt; (s),, for some standard n. Then I is closed under the multiplication, addition and successor operations of M and so I satisfies the universal axioms for these operations. Following [P], also cf. [P, H], [L] and/or [Mc, bis], we verify that I satisfies the induction principle for Yfl, . . .. YIMO_7 by reducing satisfaction of these formulas in Ito that of ? , . . ., f in M: set en = (s),, for n standard; then for all k, 1 &lt; k &lt; km, we have (by induction on km -k) that t=Qm um .

Therefore I satisfies the induction axioms P8, ... , Pmo and so I is indeed a model of P1, . Pm . The following proposition is an effective version of a result of Kirby and Paris [K, P], [K] (in the notation of Proposition 2, their result is (i) &amp; (iii)). PROPOSITION 2. Let T be a consistent recursively enumerable set of sentences of the language of arithmetic with no finite models. There exists a recursive function YT(x, y) = z such that for every nonstandard model M of TO-induction, YT is a total function in M and for all a, b, c in M such that M k= a &lt; b A YT(a, b) = c, the following are equivalent:</page><page sequence="6">408 KENNETH MCALOON (i) c is nonstandard. (ii) there exists an initial segment I of M such that a &lt; I &lt; b, I is a model of T and satisfaction in I is Turing reducible to M. (iii) there exists an initial segment I of M such that a &lt; I &lt; b and I is a model of T. PROOF. Following Kirby and Paris we define YT in terms of finite, perfect in- formation games. By a well-known trick of Craig, there is a primitive recursive axiomatization Al, A2, ... of the consequences of T. Henceforth we identify formulas with their Godel numbers. Let F1, F2, ... be a primitive recursive enumeration of the formulas of the language of arithmetic. Using these enumerations and working in 2?0-induction, we define games G,(a, b) for all integers a, b, c with a &lt; b in the following anthropomorphic way. There are two players A and B; the motivation behind the game is that player B tries to defend the thesis that there is an initial segment of the integers I such that a E I, b 0 I and I satisfies the axioms O1, . .. ., G of T, while A tries to convince B of the absurdity of this thesis. A "move" or "go" of A consists of a finite sequence e = (el, ... , e") of length n &lt; c of integers &lt; c and of a formula F = Fi(ul, . . ., uk) with k &lt; n and i &lt; c. The corresponding move for B is to answer whether or not all the e, lie in I, 1 &lt; i &lt; n, and if so whether I satisfies F(el, . . . , ek) or whether I satisfies -iF(el, ... , ek); what is more, if the play of B is that I satisfies F(el, . .. , e*) and if F(ul . .. , uk) is of the form 3x E(x, ul, . .. ., A then B must provide an e &lt; b (of which he asserts that e E I and that I satisfies E(e, el, . .. , ek)), and if F is of the form E0 v El, B must provide an integer i &lt; 2 (by which he asserts that I satisfies Ej(el, . .. , ek)). For the play of G,(a, b), player A makes a firstmove e, F and player B makes a corresponding move, player A goes again, player B responds and so on until each player has made c moves; at which point player B has won unless among the plays of B can be found either: (i) a play assetting -'An where n &lt; c (recall that Al, A2, ... is a primitive recur- sive enumeration of axioms for T) or (ii) a combination of responses which contradict B's thesis that there exists an initial segment I of the integers such that a E I, b 0 I closed for addition, multiplica- tion and successor; by this is meant a combination of assertions of one of the following kinds: the assertion that not all el, ... , ek lie in I and the assertions el E I, ... , ek E I; the assertion that el, ... , ek all lie in I and the assertion that not all el, ... , ek lie in I; dE I and e 0 I although e &lt; d; del,eelandd + e I; dE I, e E Iand dwe I; dE land d + 1 I; the assertion that I satisfies d + e = f although d + e # f; the assertion that I satisfies d * e = f although d * e # f; the assertion that I satisfies d + e # f although d + e = f; the assertion that I satisfies d * e # f although d We = f</page><page sequence="7">THE COMPLEXITY OF MODELS OF ARITHMETIC 409 or else (iii) a combination of plays which contradicts the definition of satisfaction; by this is meant a combination of one of the following kinds; the assertions that I satisfies F(el, . .. , ek) and that I satisfies -IF(el, .. ,); the assertions that I satisfies -,_3xF(x, el, ..., e") and that I satisfies F(d, el, . .. , e"); the assertion that I satisfies -, (E0 V E1) and the assertion that I satisfies E0 or the assertion that I satisfies E1. This completes the description of the games G,(a, b). These games are all finite perfect information games without draws; therefore for each G,(a, b) one of the players A or B has a winning strategy. We then define YT(a, b) = c *&gt; c is the largest integer &lt; b such that B has a winning strategy in the game G,(a, b), and we claim that YT is as required by the proposition. For the sake of precision, let us go back and formulate the notions leading to the definition of YT in some- what greater detail. The definition of a sequence number allows for infinitely many codes for a given finite sequence. For our purposes it is convenient to have canonical codes, so we make the following definitions. First, recall the definitions of the ordered pair (X, y) = (X + y)2 + X and of the ordered triple (x, y, z) = (x, (y, z)). We now define by recursion on n the class of n-tuples: first, the 1 -tuple &lt;x&gt; is defined to be the triple (1, x, x), and the n + 1 tuple &lt;xo, ... , x"&gt; is defined as the triple (n + 1, xO, &lt;x1, . .. , x &gt;). We then have &lt;x0, *.., = &lt;YO, *** Y.-,&gt; n = m and Vi &lt; n(yi = xi). Moreover, for every sequence number s with lh(s) = n, there is an n-tuple &lt;x0, . . ., xl &gt; such that xi = (s)i for all i &lt; n. A move of player A is an ordered pair (e, F) where e is an n-tuple n &lt; c, of integers &lt; b and F is a formula (we have identified formulas and their Godel numbers), F &lt; c, with no more than n free variables. A set of consecutive moves of player A is a tuple t = &lt;(l, F1), . .. , (en, F")&gt; with n &lt; c of moves of A. A move of player B is a triple (el, e2, e) where e1 &lt; 2, 62 &lt; 2 and e &lt; b; here el = 0 indicates that B asserts that the el, . .. , ek all lie in I, el = 0 and e2 = 0 indicates that B asserts that I satisfies F(el, ... , ek) and when e1 = 0 = e2, e is considered as a witness in I for 3xE(x, el, ... , ek) if F = 3xE and e mod 2 indicates which conjunct must be satisfied in I if F = E0 V E1. We introduce bounds for the possible plays of player A; let al(b), a2(b, c) and a3(b, c) be primitive recursive functions such that Vt Vn (t is an n-tuple, n &lt; c, of integers &lt; b -+ t &lt; al(b)), Vm (m is a move of player A in G,(a, b) -+ m &lt; a2(b, c)),</page><page sequence="8">410 KENNETH MCALOON Vt (t is a set of consecutive moves of player A in G,(a, b) -+t &lt; a(b, c)). A strategy for player B in G,(a, b) is a sequence number s such that lh(s) &gt; a3(b, c) which satisfies Vt (t is a set of consecutive moves of player A in G,(a, b) 3i &lt; lh(s)(3x (s)i = (t, x)) A Vi &lt; lh(s) (3x (s), = (t, x) -* x is a move of player B in G:(a, b)). A strategy a for B is said to be a winning strategy if for all sets t of consecutive moves of player A, no combination of assertions of type (i) or type (ii) or type (iii) can be found from applying oa to the initial segments of t. (We omit explicit details at this point; what we had to make precise were the notions of move and set of consecutive moves for A and of move and strategy for B.) The notions of strategy and of winning strategy for player A are defined analogously. Then if player A does not have a winning strategy for Gc(a, b), one can define a winning strategy for player B; hence the games are determined. Therefore YT(a, b) = c is a total re- cursive function. This completes the part of the proof which is carried out in 20-induction. Now suppose that M is a model of 20-induction, that a, b, c e M, that c is non- standard and that M = YT(a, b) = c. The standard integers N are embedded as an initial segment in M and this embedding can be computed effectively with Addm as an oracle : send 0 to OM and n &gt; 0 to IM + M * * . + M IM (n times). Since for- mulas are identified with their Gddel numbers, this mapping also sends formulas F to their images FM in M. If (e, f) is an ordered pair of elements of M, the corres- ponding(e,f)m is computed from AddM and MultM from the definition of ordered pair; similarly for triples (e, f, g) and for n-tuples &lt;el, . . . , es&gt;, n standard. Likewise given an n-tuple &lt;el, . .. , e"&gt; and a formula F, we can compute (&lt;el, ..,e"&gt;, F)M =((e, ***, en&gt;M, FM)M and given an n-tuple t=&lt;(el' . , el&gt;, Fl), ... ., (&lt;en *, en"&gt;, F.")&gt; we can compute tM using AddM and MultM. Furthermore, with the oracle AddM, we can decide whether e &lt; b in M: look for x 0 OM such that e + x = b or such that b + x = e if e # b. Since the field of M is N itself, we can recursively in AddM list all finite tuples of elements of M ? b and all pairs (&lt;el, . . ., e"&gt;, F) with e1, . . ., en &lt; b and with F a standard formula having no more than n-free variables; denote this list Q1, Q2, . . ., then list effectively in AddM, MultM the possible moves mi of player A where mi = Qi . (This way we list all moves of player A which are "of interest to us.") Let s E M be such that M V= s is a winning strategy for B in Gc(a, b) and let S1, s2 E M be such that M k= s1, s2 are sequence numbers, lh(sl) = lh(s2) = lh(s), and Vi &lt; lh(s)[(s)i = (t, (el, e2, e)) - (s = (t, 1), (s2), = (t, e2)].</page><page sequence="9">THE COMPLEXITY OF MODELS OF ARITHMETIC 411 For] = 1, 2 let lj, a', di E M be such that M Ad si = (Ii, ai, di) and so M ,= Vi &lt; lh(s)3g((sj), + ((i + 1)di + 1)g = a' A (sj)5 &lt; (i + 1)dj + 1). Now given an initial sequence &lt;Q1, *.., Qn&gt; of the above list of "interesting questions" we claim that we can compute the values sj(&lt;Q1, *.., Qn&gt;m) effec- tively from the oracles: one computes rl = (&lt;Q1, *.., Qn&gt;, O)M and r2 = (&lt;Q1 . . .

We define the initial segment I by a E I ' M F s1(&lt;Ql, *... Qn&gt;m) = 0 for some Qn of the form (&lt;a&gt;, F). We claim that for all a,, . .., ak E M and all formulas F(vj, ..., al,..., ak E I and I l=_ F(al, * * ., a*) . for some Qn = (&lt;a,, ..., ak&gt;, F), M s s'(&lt;Q' . .., Qn&gt;M) = 0 = S2(&lt;Q, Qn&gt;M). Since c is nonstandard and since M 1 s is a winning strategy for B in G,(a, b), the claim is verified by a straightforward induction on the complexity of formulas. It also follows from the way the rules of the games are set up, that if Qn = (&lt;a&gt;, A) where A is an axiom of T, then necessarily M 1= sl(&lt;Ql, ..., Qn&gt;m) = 0. Thus I is a model of T. This completes the proof of (i) - (ii). Since (ii) =&gt; (iii) is trivial, it remains to show (iii) : (i). So suppose that a &lt; J &lt; b and that J k T. We claim that M k YT(a, b) = c implies c is infinite. It suffices to show that M k YT(a, b) &gt; n for all standard n. Let r E M be such that M k r is a strategy for A in the game Gj(a, b). A move for player A in Gj(a, b) is a pair (e, F) where F is a standard formula and e is a tuple of standard length; by having B play according to whether or not e E J and whether or not J 1 F(el, .. ., e*), one can define a play of length n for B in the game Gj(a, b) that is coded in M and which frustrates the strategy '; so M k r is not a winning strategy. This completes the proof of Proposition 2. We shall also need the following lemma of H. Friedman. LEMMA. Let M be a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic such that all existential formulas satisfied in M are satisfied in the standard model N. Then for every non- standard a E M there exists an initial segment I of M such that N &lt; I &lt; a and I is isomorphic to M. For the proof of this lemma we refer the reader to [F] or to [Le]; we remark that we must add to these proofs a result of Gaifman [G] which implies that 20-for- mulas are equivalent in Peano arithmetic to existential formulas (this result uses in turn Matijasevich's theorem on the diophantine representability of 10-sets of integers). We shall now finish the proof of part (i) of the Main Theorem.</page><page sequence="10">412 KENNETH MCALOON Fix the nonstandard model M of 28-induction. By Proposition 1, there is an initial segment J &lt; M, J nonstandard such that J is a model of 2?-induction. Suppose T is a recursively enumerable extension of Peano arithmetic which is consistent with the set U of universal sentences satisfied in the standard model N. Let M' be a nonstandard model of T + U. For standard m, n and all nonstandard e E M', we have by Friedman's lemma that M' 1= YT(n, O) &gt; m, where YT is the function provided by Proposition 2. By underspill, for every n E N there exists kn E N such that M' 1= YT(n, k") &gt; n. By the construction of YT this function is absolute in the sense that if MO &lt; M1 are models of 10-induction, we have MO l YT(a, b) = c Ml# YT(a, b)=c for all a, b, c e Mo. Thus, N 1 YT(n, kf) &gt; n and J 1 YT(n, k") &gt; n. Let a e J be nonstandard. By overspill, as applied to E(x) x &lt; a A 3y &lt; a YT(X, y) &gt; x, there is nonstandard a' e J such that J &lt; a &lt; a A 3y &lt; a [YT(a', y) &gt; a:']. Let fi E J satisfy i 1= YT(a ', i3) &gt; a' A W3 &lt; a. Now by the method of proof of (i) =&gt; (ii) of Proposition 2, taking s, sl, S2 e J as in that proof, one shows that there is an initial segment I &lt; J which is a non- standard model of T such that satisfaction in I is Turing reducible to AddM and MultM. The following proposition is part (ii) of the Main Theorem. PROPOSITION 3. If M is a nonstandard model of 28-induction, then neither AddM nor MultM is recursive. PROOF. We use Tennenbaum's trick [T]. Let A and B be two recursively en- umerable nonrecursively separable sets of integers, defined in N by 3xa(x, n) and 3x,8(x, n), respectively, where a(x, n) and O(x, n) are 28-formulas. Let I &lt; M be a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic; such I exists by Proposition 2. Fix nonstandard b e I and consider A(v) -v &lt; b A 3x[a(x, v) A Vx' &lt; x ,8(X', v)]. Let Pl, P2, ... enumerate the prime numbers (in increasing order) and let c, c' e I satisfy I I=Vi(p I c i &lt; b A A(i)), I l= Vi(pj I c' i &lt; b A-A(i)), and let d, d' e I satisfy I = 2c = d A 2c' = d'. Consider the set A' of integers defined as follows: neA'.-&gt;I z3x(p,,x = c) M 3 x(p,.x = c). We have n A'"It=3x(p,.x = c') Mk3 x(p, x = c'). We can calculate p- x recursively from AddM by Addm-ing x to itself p"-times. Thus both A' and N - A' are recursively enumerable in AddM. Since A' separates A from B, AddM can not be recursive. As for multiplication, note that we have M l= Vx(xn &gt; x), for n standard; so</page><page sequence="11">THE COMPLEXITY OF MODELS OF ARITHMETIC 413 M = aPm = d implies that a &lt; I, for standard Pm. Similarly for d'. We have, by unique factorization in I, I -- Vx(xPM = d -+ 3y(x = 2Y A XP- = 2YPM)) and so I -- Vx(xPM = d -+ p, divides c). Thus nEA'tIk-3x(xPM = d) Mk3=x(xPM = d) and n A"I -3 x(xPM = d') Mk3=x(xPM = d'). Since xPn in M can be calculated from MultM by iteration, it follows that A' and N - A' are both recursively enumerable in MultM and so MultM is not recursive. REMARK. To obtain the result that AddM is not recursive, one does not need to involve Proposition 1 or 2; one can directly "overspill the Tennenbaum argument" using the same trick as in the proof of Proposition 1. However, for MultM we seem to need to have I, N &lt; 1 &lt; M, where exponentiation is defined and where unique factorization holds; i.e., by [C, Mc, W], we seem to need I where multiplication is recursively saturated. REMARK. It is clear from the proof of Proposition 1 that the Main Theorem holds for a finite subsystem of 18-induction. It then also holds for a finite subsystem of Primitive Recursive Arithmetic. It would be interesting to pinpoint exactly the kinds of function needed for the result to hold. REMARK. Let T be an extension of Peano arithmetic and let M be a countable existentially complete model of the V3-consequences of T, cf. [H, W]. By Theorem 1 of [Mc, ter], M is a model of the 1I2-consequences of T and hence of 18-induction. Therefore, the Main Theorem applies to M. One can extract somewhat more from the line of argument of Proposition 3. A set of integers X is said to be 20-definable in a model M if for some 10-formula 0 (v, al, ..., a*) with parameters from M we have n E X 4*M [- 0)(n, a,, * * ., a*). A set Y of integers is coded in M if there is a E M such that ne Y Mk p- Ia. Let M be a nonstandard model of 20-induction; it follows from overspill and part(i) of the Main Theorem that every coded set is recursive in AddM and in MultM; moreover, for every coded set X, there is a coded set Y which is not recur- sive in X. Hence AddM and MultM are not recursive in any coded set. When M is a model of 20-induction with n &gt; 1 every 20-definable set is coded and so AddM and MultM are not recursive in any 0-definable set of integers. Let us denote the set of (Godel numbers of) Tv-sentences satisfied in M by 3"(M). When M is a nonstandard model of 20-induction with n &gt; 1, 3"(M) is 20-definable and hence coded. Dimitracopoulos [D] has sharpened previous results and shown that for</page><page sequence="12">414 KENNETH MCALOON n &gt; 1, sets which are 92-definable in models of 10-induction are in fact 3f-defin- able. So putting things together, we have PROPOSITION 4. Let M be a nonstandard model of 20-induction with n 2 1. Sup- pose that either AddM or MultM is A0+1; i.e. recursive in 3"(N). Then 3"(N) is not coded in M and M satisfies a 3 -sentence which is not satisfied in N. This proposition in case n = 1 strengthens a result of Jeroslow [J], where the hypotheses are that the complete diagram of M be recursive in 31(N) and that M satisfy full induction. In case n = 2 it extends in similar fashion part of Corol- lary 3.3 of Hajek's paper [H]. That these do constitute refinements follows from (unpublished) work of Harrington. The proof of Proposition 3 shows that there are sets recursive in AddM and in MultM which separate effectively inseparable pairs of recursively enumerable sets, cf. [Ro]. This fact enables one to say even more about the complexity of AddM and MultM. PROPOSITION 5. Let M be a countable nonstandard model of 28-induction. Then there is a complete extension of Peano arithmetic which is recursive in AddM and similarly for MultM. PROOF. This follows from the implication (iii) -+ (ii) of Theorem 6.6 of [Sim] and the preceding remarks. The referee has pointed out that one can avoid invoking [Sim] and the underlying theorem of Jockusch and Soare and obtain the last result by means of an argument used by Lipshitz and Nadel [L, N] together with (i) of the Main Theorem: if I&lt; M is a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic the structure (I, +) is recursively saturated and so can be expanded to a recursively saturated model of Peano arithmetic; the complete theory of this expansion is coded therein and so is re- cursive in AddM and in MultM. Alternatively, one can apply Quinsey's remark that I can be found recursively saturated in part (i) of the Main Theorem. We conclude with remarks on how to refine part (i) of the Main Theorem. Clearly the proofs show that there are arbitrarily low initial nonstandard segments I &lt; M which satisfy the theory T. Moreover, the hypothesis that T extend Peano arithmetic can be considerably weakened as was observed by Quinsey; it is enough to suppose that the axiomatizable theory T extend 27 induction. For Solovay has shown that countable nonstandard recursively saturated models of Z?-induction are isomorphic to proper initial segments of themselves, cf. [P, bis]. Thus such models have proper and extensions to models of the same theory; hence we have, after noting that construction of the indicators can be carried out in 27-induction, T F- Vx3yYT(x, y) &gt; Fi, for all standard n. This result together with those of [D] can be substituted for those of [F] and [G] which are used at the very end of our proof of part (i) of the Main Theorem. BIBLIOGRAPHY [C] P.
