<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Recent Acquisitions of Modern Sculpture by Public Collections Supplement to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, February 1981 Cologne, Museum Ludwig. Fig.92. Martian Ears, by Mark di Suvero (b. 1933). Steel, 200 by 170 by 180 cm., 1975. A representative work of recent years, in which the American sculptor di Suvero combines humorous invention with formal ingenuity; outer-space imagery is transformed through cut and welded steel into something sinister and imposing. Fig.96. The Guitar, by Henri Laurens (1885-1954). Painted iron, irregular, height 44 cm, 1918. The Guitar belongs to the end of Laurens's most overtly adven- turous period, 1915-18, in which he was working as both 'sculptor' and maker ofpapiers collis, his subjects often repeated in both mediums. A papier coll of 1917-18 Guitar is related to the present work (coll. Claude Laurens, Paris). Until 1918 his work was strongly influenced by Braque and Gris's painting, although the two-dimensional pictorial method of assemblage in The Guitar also relates it to some of Picasso's constructions of 1912-15. Fig.93. Volton XV, by David Smith (1906-65). Steel, height 190 cm, 1963. After his highly open, least anthropomorphic work of the 1950s, Smith seems to have been returning in the two or three years before his death, to a more suggestively figurative man- ner of working, as exemplified by Volton XV. The Museum Ludwig also owns an extremely spare construction Untitled of 1953, thus providing an interesting comparison of Smith's development. Edinburgh, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Fig.94. Bird swallowing a fish, by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (1891-1915). Bronze, 31.5 by 61 by 28 cm, 1914. One of Gaudier's last sculptures, in which organic and mechanistic forms are synthesised. It was exhibited (cast in gun-metal) at the 1914 Allied Artists' Salon (no.45) and shown at Gaudier's Memorial Exhibition, Leicester Galleries, 1918 as Sea Bird (no.95). The original plaster is in the Kettle's Yard Collection, Cambridge as is an ink drawing of the subject. A slighter pencil drawing is in the Mus&amp;e National d'Art Mod- erne, Paris. Richard Cork writes that eleven bronzes were cast ('Vorticism and its allies', Arts Council, 1974, cat. no.210) while Roger Cole states that at least thirteen bronzes exist ('Burning to Speak', Phaidon, 1978, p.119). Fig.97. Nightscape, by Louise Nevelson (b. 1900). Painted wood, 258.5 by 347 by 42 cm, 1957-64. A representative and evocative assemblage by this veteran American sculptor whose work is too little known in England. Her recent eightieth birthday was widely celebrated in America culminating in a tribute at the Whitney Museum 'Atmospheres and Environments' last summer. London, Tate Gallery. Fig.91. Seated Figure on a Bench, by Willem de Kooning (b.1904). Bronze, 96.5 cm, 1972. Willem de Kooning first started making sculpture in 1969 and was encouraged by Henry Moore who saw his first attempts. The work continues de Kooning's preoccupation with the single female figure, its energetic modelling in clay running parallel to his recent 'rococo' handling of paint in similar sub- jects. This important new work was purchased in 1980. Middlesbrough Art Gallery. Fig.95. Wrestlers, by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (1891-1915). Her- culite, 72.4 by 92.7 cm. Monogram, one of an edition of nine casts; original plaster at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. 1913. Gaudier's best known treatment of a favourite theme. In the same year he designed an inlaid wood tray for the Omega Workshops (two vertical wrestling figures); there is an ink drawing at Kettle's Yard for the present work, and Gaudier's only known lino-cut, printed by Horace Brodzky, was a further version. Gaudier made studies at the London Wrestling Club off Fleet Street which he often attended with a sporting friend and patron Major Wheeler. The present cast was exhibited at the Mayor Gallery, London, January 1981 (Recent Acquisi- tions by Middlesbrough Art Gallery). Portsmouth, City Museum and Art Gallery. Fig.90. Head, study for 'Pax', by Frank Dobson (1888-1963). Terracotta, 23.5 cm, inscr. Dobson, 1934. This is one of three known studies of the head of Pax, a large female figure carved from Portland stone in 1935, and one of Dobson's most important works. In its simplifications, Pax bears some resemblances to the three large figure-sculptures by Epstein of a similar date, recently (November 1980) on show at Anthony d'Offay, but its whole rhythm and 'pro- gramme' are quite different. The study for the head shown here is not only indebted to Maillol (as is the final sculpture) but carries reminiscences of Sinhalese work which had impress- ed Dobson on a visit to Ceylon and India in the winter of 1924-25. The head was included in Dobson's third one-artist exhibition in 1935 at the Leicester Galleries; it was subse- quently in the collection of the architect Sir Edward Maufe. 128</page><page sequence="2">90.
