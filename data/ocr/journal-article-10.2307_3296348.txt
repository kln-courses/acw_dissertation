<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRD IMAGERY IN ROMAN POETRY The classicist interested in ornithology depends heavily on the works of D'Arcy Thompson for Greek and E. W. Martin for Latin literature.' Their interests, however, were limited to identification, usually of genus only, rarely can one name the species.2 Consequently they deal only with passages in which a bird is named or described sufficiently for identification. Their lists are therefore inadequate to an investigation of poetic imagery, since this can be achieved without mention of a particular bird. Martin draws a few general conclusions. He notes the Romans' awareness of birds, and claims a special awareness of the fall migration because at that time of year birds are more noticeable since they come and stay for the winter.' To support this he lists some seven- 1D. W. Thompson, A Glossary of Greek Birds (Oxford, 1895 and 1936). Thompson gives Latin equivalents for Greek names and thus contributes to Latin identification. Ernest W. Martin, The Birds of the Latin Poets, Stanford Univ. Publication, University Series 13 (Palo Alto, 1914), pp. 1-260. Martin's index is very difficult to use since it is full of error in line references (usually metathesis of digits or wrong book number). The many prose references included add noth- ing, and the hundreds of quotations (with no reference other than author!) from English and American poetry serves no useful purpose. Lockwood's review (CJ., 10 [1915], p. 190) noted these elements but missed the line errors. 2Some birds can be precisely identified because there is only one possibility (either only one species or only one possible by distribution). Among such are Alcedo (kingfisher), Ardea (heron), Coturnix (quail), Cuculus (cuckoo), Cygnus (swan), Epops (hoopoe), Fulica (coot), Merops (bee-eater), Passer Marinus (ostrich), Pavo (peacock), Phasianus (pheasant), Phoenicopterus (flamingo), Pica (magpie), Picus (green woodpecker), Sturnus (starling). More typical is the uncertainty of species within a genus or even of different genera. There may be several possibilities, some more likely than others. Among the uncertain identifications are Columba and Palumba (several kinds of doves and pigeons), Hirundo (swallow, swift, three kinds of martins), Haliaeetos (white tailed eagle or osprey), Mergus (very loose usage: grebe, cormorant, diver, merganser, even gull), Milvus (kite or black kite or black-winged kite), Noctua, Strix and others (uncertain application among little owl, long-eared owl, short-eared owl, hawk owl, tawny eagle), Parus (4 kinds of tits), Passer (any sparrow or fringillid), Vultur (probably the Egyptian vulture but could be the black, bearded, or griffin). 3Fall migration "made deeper impressions and aroused wider range of observa- tion" (p. 277). Martin argues that in spring "birds appear in smaller numbers and their stay as migrants was for a shorter time" and that in fall flocks were augmented by the young (p. 227). The number of birds is not a good argument, as normal mortality of adults in summer and of adults and young on fall migra- tion does not permit fall numbers to be appreciably greater (certainly not notice- ably to the indifferent Roman). Martin's claim that the autumn flight was associ- ated with good cheer and was pretty largely free from the sentimental associations of more northern lands where the fall migration was grouped in thought and feeling with the waning of summer and the coming of winter with its cold and gloom (p. 227), seems, if indeed true, utterly irrelevant. "Good cheer" is simply not so, and there are many references to cold winter. All of this is not convincing and Martin weakens his own case when he states (p. 224-225) "In the Latin poets recognition of the spring migration, spring song and nesting is somewhat more widely attested" [than in Greek] and emphasizes 1</page><page sequence="2">2 JOHN N. HOUGH teen passages. He seems to forget that the spring migration (for which he lists sixteen passages!) must be even more noticeable since it is marked auditorily by song (usually absent in the fall) and visually by plumage (in many species much more striking than in fall). Neither author is concerned with poetry, nor the uses to which bird material is put other than to list various categories such as song (joy or lament), nests, omens, food, carrion, coloring, hunting habits, etc., but they never examine the suitability or the effectiveness of a passage in context. Since these are subjective matters it is appropriate to illustrate the contrast between good and bad. In Apollonius' Argonautica 4.1479, when the wind brings a mysterious sound in the night, the Argonauts set out to find what it is, thinking it might be the lost Heracles. Lynceus the keen-sighted thought "he saw Heracles alone, far over the endless land, as a man sees, or thinks he sees, the new moon through the mist." This is a beautiful simile, but not at all suitable to the burly and muscular Heracles. In contrast Vergil (Aeneid 6.452) applied the self-same simile to Aeneas's vision of the ghost of Dido moving through the forest in the Underworld. Unsuitability can ruin the effectiveness of even a beautiful simile. In examining all passages, whether a bird is specifically mentioned or not, four categories emerge, only the fourth of which is significant and the subject of our inquiry: 1) A mere reference with no attribute, description or anything to enhance literary quality, e.g., a bird flies. 2) Reference to a myth which automatically conjures up a concept of a bird, but with no literary adornment, e.g., Philomela, Hal- cyon, Tityos. 3) Conventional epithet or attribute expressed usually by one or pos- sibly two modifiers-a cliche with no further adornment, e.g., dove of Venus, white swan. 4) A poetic image (simile, metaphor or description) of a bird or its activity usually to illustrate some object or action in the context. Passages of the first three types contribute to an author's "bird consci- ousness", as it were, but nothing to his skill or poetry. The total of all types is 724; type 4, 171 passages.4 Some genres may be quickly dis- "the wide sympathy which the Romans felt for the varied bird life of the spring time."

These are satire, occasional poetry and comedy. References in satire total sixty-five.5 Sixteen are allusions to birds as food; of the remaining fifty-eight only five even approach literary merit: crows calling others to food (Hor., Epist. 1.17, 50), gulls on broken timbers of a shipwreck (Pers. 6.27), Temple of Concord metaphorically twittering when a stork nest on it is saluted (Juv. 1.114), old men gape at food like a young swallow about to be fed (Juv. 10.231), Horace's metaphor for literary plagiarism, the crow in stolen plumage (Epist. 1.3, 19, the most elaborate bird picture in all satire, but it is not poetry). Of eighty-nine passages in Martial sixty-eight (thirty-three in Xenia) are mere references, eight allude to myth, eleven are conventional epi- thets and only two can conceivably qualify as poetry: 9.54, a list of common barnyard birds distinguished only for the colorful adjectives and a gentle picture (8.32) of a dove as herald of the longed-for return of an exile. In Statius' Silvae seventeen allusions yield but four poetic images. Two, swans claraque gaudentes plauserunt limina (1.2, 146) and the birds for people to catch at Saturnalia games (1.6, 75-80), are not im- pressive except for colorful modifiers.6 3.5, 57 is a picture of Alcyone and Philomela, more than mere myth and, by far the best, is a charming image of spring when brooks, trees and birds come alive.7 Among minor poets a lovely verse of Petronius is the only passage worth citing: Procne and the nightingale bearing witness to stolen love among the flowers.8 The unimportance of comedy is not surprising. Of forty-seven refer- ences in Plautus only four have any color, and no one would argue strongly even for them.' Terence has but two allusions, one of which 5Lucilius 1, Varro (Menip.) 2, Horace (Sat. and Epist.) 21, Persius 11, Juvenal 26. 6Flamingos from the Nile, pheasants from Phasis, guinea-fowl from Numidia and the colorful words gaudent dum nova lucra comparantur. 7Silv. 4.5.9-12 frondibus amnis crinitur arbos; nunc volucrem novi questus, inexpertumque carmen quod tacita statuere bruma.

HOUGH (Phor. 330) is Phormio's description of his sycophantic activity as a net spread not for hawks but for innocent birds; at least it conjures up a picture. Tragedy, employing more grandiloquent language, might be expected to provide more material. Pacuvius mentions roaming halcyons fre- quenting the shore (Frg. 149, Ribb.), but this hardly offers a basis for further speculation. In Seneca there are twenty-four passages, but only six rise to any heights of imagery. They include three passages dealing with spring (Med. 714, nests; Oed. 452, birds singing in trees; Oed. 605, ghosts numbered as great as birds leaving the Strymon in winter, which is not as good as Vergil's similar passage, see below). Phoen. 420 is an overdrawn hyperbole by Jocasta who envisages birds carrying her to the battlefield; Ag. 670-685 is a conventional lament of nightingale, halcyon and swan, notable only for its length; the only really good picture in all Seneca is Oed. 899 where Daedalus is stilled in mid-air watching for Icarus, as a bird watches for a hawk, but this is ruined for the ornithologist because it is the hawk who can hover, not the bird it pursues! This is a generous count for Seneca and unimpressive. One might expect more in choral passages, but of the six, three are in dialogue and three in chorus. Tragedy is nearly as disappointing as comedy. EPIC The firm position of simile in epic tradition assures broad opportunity for bird material, but there is great divergence among poets in suitability and effectiveness, as well as in selection of type. The following table shows totals and raw number of each type, and frequency (one example per number of lines for totals and for imagery only, proportionate to length of poem), and percent of p. i. to total: Per cent Type Frequency P I to Total 1 2 3 4 Total P I Total Statius (Ach.

Vergil is a clear third, and very economical. Valerius Flaccus is the same as Silius in frequency total but far ahead in imagery; Lucan is a poor last. The per cent of quality of image passages in total and the quality of these passages are far more significant than frequency and is the subject of our inquiry. Here Vergil clearly excels. Silius and Lucan are somewhat prosaic, perhaps because in historical epic there is an unavoidable tie to fact. Their straining for effect may be an attempt to offset this disadvantage and it might account for their low standing in all categories. Silius, although his long digressions on myth might seem to invite imagery, employs it no more than the less digressive Lucan. Even when they do, some will wish they had not. Silius is so inept in simile that of nine listed passages only three are really effective: a fall of a tree into which men had climbed likened to bird nests tossed by the wind (5.504); fear of fugitives terrified by the least sound, even birds on the wing (6.59); and, by far his best, Orpheus' music made birds forget their nestlings and hang motionless in air (11.467). Of the other six, four are only fair images of which one raises an interesting problem: that eaglets' genuineness is tested by whether they can stare open eyed at the sun (a thing all birds can do).xo Two are unbelievably bad and deserve note as such: a soldier springs from branch to branch to avoid attack but is pierced by a spear like a bird, hopping among branches but caught by fowlers' poles (7.672) and a man watching an enemy warily planning secret surprises likened to a swan floating with feet noiselessly swimming beneath the surface (13.189). This may be surreptitious silence, but it is not poetry! Lucan rarely uses birds, but can sometimes be very effective. He likens the silence of still weather to birds in winter (1.259); he numbers the deaths at Pharsalus-so many that birds became gorged and forced to delay their fall migration (artificial and unpleasant and, since Pharsa- lus was on August 9, rather hyperbolic but indubitably forceful x0All birds can do this, though there is no evidence that it is done for any pur- pose. For discussion of anatomy and morphology of the eye, see E. Streseman, Ares in Handbuch der Zoologie, ed. W. Kiikenthal, (Berlin, 1927), 7, pt. 2, p. 141. Perhaps because the eagle is the bird of the highest god, Zeus, and the sun is the major celestial body, it was imagined to be a test of worthiness (10.108, also Lucan Phars. 9.902). The three not discussed above are 5.280 (pursuit of prey), 12.59 (eagle attacks serpent) and 13.238 (spear cleaves the air as a bird).</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN N. HOUGH (7.831); and finest of all, the flight of cranes from the frozen Strymon to the Nile, in the pattern of which Palamedes saw shapes for letters in the alphabet, illustrates the disarray of ships that have lost their battle order (5.711). Lucan may be economical of material, and gory at times, but he is never inept." Valerius Flaccus uses fifteen bird passages (almost as many as Lucan in three-fourths his lines) but nine are commonplace. Even the six poetic images are rather badly chosen.12 Hercules' and Alcyone's lam- ents are compared (4.44) but they are hardly a suitable pair. Bloody death is likened to a bird caught in lime imploring the boughs and flapping its wings in vain (6.260). Venus leads Medea in terror through the city as birds teach their young how to fly (7.375; contrast Ovid. Met., 8.312 where with Daedalus the simile is better). The worst, per- haps, is Jason, standing alone in battle, even as a bird battling the burn- ing sands of the south, Rhipaean heights and snows of the northwind-- a fine picture but wholly unsuitable to a fighting warrior (7.557). Flac- cus can be just as tasteless with other material, e.g., the love-sick Medea like a mad dog and the Harpies are like the rain of Vesuvius' ashes (7.124 and 4.517). Though individual images have some beauty, Valerius uses them so poorly that he is unquestionably the most inept of epic poets. The Metamorphoses of Ovid has, because of subject matter, many references to birds. Of eighty, thirty-two are metamorphoses, many with no imagery. Of the twenty-five effective passages, fifteen are meta- morphoses, but the degree of effectiveness varies greatly. Contrasting suitability is well illustrated by two passages (4.361 and 714) in which eagles attack serpents. In 714 the picture is of a monster furiously chasing his shadow, but in 361 human sexual embrace is like the en- twined serpent, hardly as suitable as the immediately following com- parison to ivy clinging to an oak. But Ovid chooses well when a mother bird teaches her fearful young to fly, even as Daedalus did Icarus (8.213). On the whole he comes off with credit; there are few bad images and some are rich in effective detail (e.g., Procne, 6.666-674). His interests are varied; few similes are used more than once (eagle and prey, hawks and serpent, song of swans); some of the most effective are the silence of birds at midnight, the absence of birds roosting in flooded trees, and the water birds of the marsh."3 It will surprise no one that although moderate in number, Vergil, in suitability and quality of imagery, is superb. Neither Lucan nor Statius can compete and any comparison merely emphasizes the inferiority of Vergil's successors. Of seventeen bird passages in the Aeneid that con- "Though only an omen 5.555 is a very colorful description of birds' actions; in 9.902 eaglets stare again at the sun. 12The sixth, 1.156-160, is a conventional eagle carrying off a lamb, but it is quite colorful. 3aMetam., 7.185; 1.308; 8.624.</page><page sequence="7">BIRD IMAGERY IN ROMAN POETRY 7 tribute to poetic imagery, eleven are similes and by any criteria thirteen are unexcelled, three are rather ordinary and one, though beautiful, is an ornithological curiosity. This is the elaborate simile (12.473-477) in which Juturna goes through the enemy lines like a black swallow that flies through the house of a rich man and crosses high atria in quest of scraps of food, now in the empty portico, now in fishponds, so drives Juturna through thick foe and flies now here, now there. To an ornithologist the simile is hopelessly inept. No swallow eats food scraps and certainly not from the dining table; fishponds are fine places to catch insects on the wing, possibly also in the atria where insects might fly above a table, but not food scraps. No swallow in Europe is black; certainly it is a swift, and the blackness is intended to foretell the black doom of Turnus." Two others seem somewhat awkward: in 9.563 Turnus seizes Lycus as he hangs in mid-air, drags him down and with him a fragment of wall as an eagle takes in his hooked talons a hare or a snow white swan and soars into the sky. This is a fine image but rather out of place with Lycus and a fragment of wall.'5 Exaggeration does not replace beauty. 7.699-702 and 703-705 are separate, but adjacent similes. The first is an array of swans returning from feeding, but perhaps far too gentle for the catalogue of armies arrayed. Nor is the bronze clad army of the second passage quite suitable to the lofty nubem volucrum raucarum. The parent passage in the Iliad (2.459-466) is more elaborate and the similarity to flocks of great birds is spelled out in more detail. Possibly the passage is unfinished; 702 is a short line (pulsa palus); the grammar of 704-705 is awkward and the whole passage is not Vergil at his best. But even severe critics can fault no others. In contrast to the passages above here are two of the very best. The flight of swans attacked by an eagle is broken and likened to the confusion of Aeneas' ships in the storm of 1.392. The parallelism of some swans alighting and some already alit well illustrates the ships, some safe in port, some just enter- ing with full spread sails (like swans' wings?). This is superb. Finally (the choice is difficult) 6.309 likens the number of shades in the under- world to that of falling leaves in autumn and the birds flocking when winter drives them to sunnier climes. The Latin is more detailed and rich in the unspoken implication of death in fallen leaves and the fate of birds should they remain. Vergil's similes are varied but he uses good ones more than once Four passages compare warfare to attacks by birds of prey; six deal 14The European swift has black underparts, but it could also be the tan colored sand martin, which would look dark against the sky. Hirundo does service for all three. 15That Lycus apparently is the wall and dies in the simile does not seem to me to improve it. Cf. R. A. Hornsby, Patterns of Action in the Aeneid (Iowa City, 1970), p. 67.</page><page sequence="8">8 JOHN N. HOUGH with various aspects of bird flight; three refer to song or other sound; others employ the picture of omen, perching, carrion-but in all cases are highly suitable.16 Were there no Vergil, Statius' skill with bird material would rank even higher. Critical assessment cannot fault some sixteen of his twenty- six passages of poetic imagery and this is no mean literary score. Of the others nine are so long or elaborate that they transcend an otherwise conventional quality (e.g., twenty-four lines doggedly belaboring prodi- gies associated with birds of prey [Theb. 3.524-548]). One (Ach. 1.372) is such bad ornithology as to merit note here. The daughters of Ly- comedes welcome the disguised Achilles and make room for "her" even as Idalian doves, first in fear and then in joy, welcome a strange bird and hover joyfully around it and lead it to lofty perches. This may sound beautiful but it is ludicrous to one who knows that the peck system is aggressive and hostile action. Statius may be excused for his ornithological ignorance, but not for his false observation! His com- parison of Thetis' indecision where to hide Achilles (Ach. 1.212) to a bird's indecision where to build a nest, is less objectionable, but he might better have avoided comparison of birds to the mighty warrior Achilles! But these are the worst. Some are worthy of Vergil, among them the joyful exultation as swarms of swans in the spring when winter yields, return to praise the smiling Strymon. Or the hearts at rest (Theb. 12.515) as cranes, sped by wind at winter's end, with joyful clamor migrate north. A gruesome, but effective passage is the swarms of in- cestuous birds veiling the stars while the wind tells them from afar of corpses unburied and thither they greedily haste as the air resounds with flapping wings and lesser birds yield place (Theb. 9.27). Statius is forced, strained, colored by rhetorical conceit but he clearly liked ornithological material and even if highly anthropomorphic, used it well, far better than his silver age contemporaries. Of Statius' twenty- six passages eleven are descriptions, not similes." This is by far the least "6Attacks: 9.563, 11.721, 751; flight: 1.392, 4.255, 5.213, 6.309, 10.265, 12.473; song: 7.32, 8.456, 11.456; omen: 12.247; perching: 5.124; carrion: 6.595. 17All Statius' passages are well worth examining in some detail; all are descrip- tions unless a simile is noted. All references are to the Thebaid except the last one. 1.625 birds flee the sight of death. 2.39 desolation where no wing beats. 2.505 gory death of Sphinx. 3.113 bird vocabulary. 3.428 Fama with whirring wings. 3.506 colorful adjectives with raven, hawk and eagle omen. 5.9 simile of weapons through trees like cranes across sea. 5.599 simile of killing as snakes kill birds in nest. 6.97 birds leave when trees are cut. 8.205 quiet in which no bird flies. 8.616 simile of nightingale's lament.</page><page sequence="9">BIRD IMAGERY IN ROMAN POETRY 9 proportion of any author; might it mean he thought of birds more as reality than merely as poetic imagery? DIDACTIC Didactic poetry consists of Lucretius, Vergil's Georgics and the Astronomica of Manilius. The latter may be ignored since of eleven references (mostly to constellations) only one has any poetic value (5.558), Alcyon seeking to comfort Andromeda. Lucretius has twenty-four passages, of which eleven employ birds in language far more poetic than the needs of science require. In an other- wise unembellished discussion of men imitating birds' songs before making musical instruments (5.1379) there is no great imagery but the gratuitous addition of the single epithet liquidas to the avium voces does more for poetry than for science. Similarly the bald statement that birds have various notes for different purposes (5.1078) contains more poetry than necessary to make his point and several details show it. It is hardly necessary to the identification of the ossifragae and mergi as sea birds to add marinis fluctibus in salso victum vitamque petentes. And why did he modify cantus with the colorful raucisonos or refer to crows as cornicum saecla vetusta, or describe their activities as elaborately as aquam et imbris/poscere et interdum ventos aurasque vocare? These are fine confirmations of the too often forgotten truism that Lucretius, scientist and philosopher, is also ever the poet of nature. In the superb and totally unnecessary metaphor of 3.6 Lucretius, instead of simply saying "Why should I try to emulate Epicurus?" begins with quid enim contendat hirundo cycnis and re-enforces it with further reference to horses and lambs. Even the conventional suffering of Tityos can fill eight lines (3.984-991). The others all support the picture of a poet, interested in and devoted to nature as much as to science.s8 In the Georgics there are only fourteen references of which eight have some poetic imagery. The most impressive is the long passage (1.360- 8.674 simile of eagle attacking swan. 9.360 simile of Alcyon's lament. 9.858 simile of swan attacked by eagle. 10.91 silence of no bird song. 12.15 simile of fugitives hiding as doves from snakes. 12.478 simile of mourning as Getic bird's lament. 12.565 birds and carrion on battlefield. Ach. 1.555 simile of birds gathering. 18De R. N., 1.256, 2.799, 4.180, 544, 710, 1007; 5.818 is a long factual discussion of birds killed by the poisonous fumes of Avernus, yet done with much poetic imagery. In line 363 mergi is sometimes translated cormorant, which it could hardly be in this passage. Cormorants stretch their wings to dry in the sun, but this could hardly be called sicco ludunt. Coot is more probable. Similar confusion occurs in crows, etc.; cf. Martin, op. cit., p. 73, on cornix, corniculus, etc. Ameri- can usage is equally sloppy. Horace's Ars Poetica has two allusions, but no imagery.</page><page sequence="10">10 JOHN N. HOUGH 420) dealing with the times of year when various activities of nature take place. There are fifteen separate allusions to birds and all reflect keen observation, occasionally more poetic than scientific. There are two very fine short passages: 3.338; the evening dew falling from the moon and litoraque alcyonem resonant acalanthida dumi; and 4.511, a fine nightingale song. The others are all but conventional: 2.209 and 4.309, birds' nests; 2.328, song in spring; 3.546, birds die in plague; and 4.473, phantoms as many as birds that hide in foliage. This paucity of birds in Vergil may merely indicate that he is more sympathetic to the pragmatism of the Italian farmer to whom birds must have been, as they still are, an enemy to crops and fruit, pests to sheep and cattle and a source of food for man. There is hardly a hint of the future epic simile. PASTORAL One might expect shepherds, real or literary, to see and hear the creatures and sounds of nature, at least as much as do epic heroes or didactic poets. Yet the Vergil of the Aeneid is even further away from the Eclogues than from the Georgics. In 830 lines there are ten refer- ences, but only one strikes a picturesque note (1.58) where Meliboeus sees rustic happiness, hears the raucae palumbes and turtur ab ulmo, but this is scarcely better than the conventional eagle that swoops on sacred doves and the crows that call omens on the left which lead in anticlimax to Vergil's claim he cannot sing themes worthy of Varius or Cinna (9.13).19 Later pastoral is scarcely better. Nemesianus in 2.60 describes gifts to a lover, a conventional nightingale, but beautifully pictured vocalem longos quae ducit aedona cantis, and though a pet in captivity, the image of its freedom to fly and return to nature, even if somewhat "silver," is not unpleasant. In 4.39 is the unadorned, but sound, observation that birds do not sing in midday heat. In Cynegetica 312-320 the description of colored feathers for making snares is more detailed than net manu- facture requires, but hardly makes Nemesianus a bird lover. Calpurnius Siculus, on the other hand, does rather well in his small corpus: six fine passages in 759 lines. 6.58 states that rude Alcon can have defeated Nyctilus in song is as if the crow defeated the acanthis or the owl the nightingale. 2.11 is a more conventional beating of the air with wings, but 3.48 is a remarkable passage: non sic destructa marces et turdus olivae, in which the bird in a tree stripped of leaves carries overtones of age, "as I grow old for love of you." A gentle tenderness is derived (3.76) from putting doves in your lap and 5.16 is by far the best picture of song of birds returning in the spring to be found in all Roman pastoral. Finally "Do not put your sheep in summer pens until 19Ec. 1.1, 58 and 9.13 discussed above; two unadorned references at 3.69 and 8.77; three mythological 6.42 and 80, 9.36; three conventional epithets 7.38, 8.22 and 9.29.</page><page sequence="11">BIRD IMAGERY IN ROMAN POETRY 11 birds in their fragile nests think of calling sleep and chirp their laments in tremulous song" easily carries off the palm, such as it is, of disap- pointing pastoral.20 LYRIC, ELEGIAC AND LOVE POETRY Bird themes are not as widely used in love and lyric poetry as readers of modern verse might imagine. Coloration, flight, gentleness, prettiness, softness or other pleasant qualities associated with love are not entirely absent but take inferior place to omens, myth, or metamorphosis. In erotic and elegy we are dealing, presumably, not with the rustic fear and pragmatism, but with sophisticated urban society. Nevertheless we encounter the same mentality that, even if it no longer really believes in myth or augury, is unwilling to shed traditional clich6s in favor of ra- tional or imaginative lyricism. Consequently, because of the power of innate rustic conservatism, Romans seem not inclined to ornithological ecstasy and no such outpouring ever appears in Latin as "Whither midst falling dew, doest thou pursue thy solitary way?" or "Hail to thee, blithe spirit, bird thou never wert," least of all Keats' eighty lines to that same nightingale21 that in ancient poetry sings both sadly and joyfully and is a symbolic reminder of gruesome murder! All in all, except for a few caged birds, which neither concern us nor represent true nature,22 there is no poetry to or about birds, nor do birds represent emotions which we associate with them. The references to birds in poetry of these genres are 168, of which only thirty-seven employ poetic imagery.

The text presents much difficulty which has evoked emendations most notably tremuli tremebunda coagula lactis and dent mulctra coagula lactis, but the birds remain in line 64. 21A. R. Chandler, "The Nightingale in Greek and Latin Poetry," CJ, 30 (1934), 70, handles the various ways in which the nightingale is employed (symbolic of song, of the poet himself, spring, love, and in mediaeval times, praise of God). Chandler is not concerned with excellence of imagery. 22Caged birds are listed in type 1 (reference only). Even Lesbia's passer (with or without obscenity) offers no ornithological beauty, but stands for what Catullus wishes he had. Statius, Silv. 2.4 is no better.</page><page sequence="12">12 JOHN N.

In 68.84 the peck- ing of doves symbolizes the wantonness of a woman's kisses (but it is bad ornithology) and in 66.53 the lock of Berenice is carried by the ales equus of Locrian Arsinoe (presumably an ostrich) impellens nu- tantibus aera pennis, not very suitable for a flightless bird.23 Did Catullus or Callimachus err? Tibullus, for all his rusticity, is more concerned with omens (four times) and conventional epithets (three) than with imagery of birds. Only when he writes his own epitaph (1.3, 59) do birds enhance a pic- ture: Venus leads him to the Elysian Fields where hic choreae cantus- que vigent, passimque vagantes / dulce sonant tenui gutture carmen aves. Propertius' larger corpus yields but six instances of poetic imagery. The best24 is the thick foliage that hides the birds (4.9,30), but the most interesting is 3.3,31 where doves dip their red bills in the Gorgon's fount. There is no dove in Europe with a red bill. The Gorgon's fount, i.e., Hippocrene, is poetically red; it recalls Pegasus who sprang from the blood of Medusa. Therefore, although obvious only to an ornitho- logist, punica must be rather obscurely proleptic (tingunt Gorgoreo punica rostra laca). Combined with the green cave, pebbles, timbrels, ivy and roses that follow, this ten-line passage is the finest description of nature in Propertius. Horace is far better than the elegists. But, although he has eleven striking passages out of thirty, when examined they are rather disap- pointing. Is, for example, fortuna cum stridore acuto sustulit (1.34, 15) any more poetic than non usitata ferar / pinna biformis perliquidum aera (2.20, 1-2)? Convention seems to dominate. The swan following in lines 10-15 is better! The pleasant effect of bird song (Epod. 2.26 and C. 3.1, 20) doves taking cover in foliage (C. 3.3, 12), the fear for absent ones as the fear for birds' absence from the nest (Epod. 1.19) are the best of Horace's ornithology. Owls (Epod. 5.19 and 93) merely illustrate the evil of magic. Horace, as one would expect, can be effec- tive, but does not seem to wish to very often. Ovid, although varied in poetic types, shows no very great differences therein. Proportionately he uses material in the Fasti, and some of his very best are there. Birds in the spring (1.155 and 4.166), the long 23Actually the observation of nature may not be so bad, since ostriches do spread their vestigial wings, but they do it for sexual display, not in running, and do not flap them, but merely hold them out. 240f the others 1.2, 14 and 1.16, 46 are fairly conventional allusions to dawn and spring, but Propertius seems to show some feeling for birds here; in 3.13, 32 "birds of various spotted plumage" is not inspiring, but it is better than just "a bird." Alcyone in 3.10, 9 is more elaborate than just myth.</page><page sequence="13">BIRD IMAGERY IN ROMAN POETRY 13 description of the destruction of birds because they betrayed the secrets of the Gods (1.441-456), the 18-line tale of Proca and the owl (6.132- 168)-these are as good as any in Ovid. Nothing from elsewhere needs be mentioned;25 he is no more ornithological than Catullus or Tibullus. The highly lyric Pervigilium Veneris has three fine passages in a mere 110 lines. The two best deal with the bird sounds of spring (vere nubunt alites, 3 and canoras non tacere diva iussit ales, 84); the third (rauco stagna cycni, 86) is part of a longer section with fine allusions to animals and nature. It is tantalizing to speculate that later Roman poetry may have been more attuned to birds.26 Our conclusions are firm, but negative; clearly there is a basic lack of real interest in nature. Martin overstates his claim for "wide sym- pathy for the varied bird life," whether of spring or fall. Of all the passages here discussed not more than a dozen or so could possibly be called "wide sympathy." Skill in use of imagery is clearly greatest in Lucretius and Vergil, and only less in Statius and Lucan. We find the absence of birds exactly where moderns expect it the most: lyric, elegy and pastoral. The Romans' conventional views include the uncritical acceptance of anthropological attributions such as joy and sorrow, the wholly false assumption that pecking is evidence of love rather than ag- gressive intimidation, and that song, though it often sounds beautiful to man, is frequently the aggression of the territorial imperative. They did not really understand birds as being part of a brutal and ruthless nature. Even the superficial appearance of beauty, of which modems make so much use, they treat with indifference and employ it for poetic purposes only within restricted limits, almost totally controlled by con- vention and formality.
