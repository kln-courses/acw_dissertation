<plain_text><page sequence="1">Installation view of "Kilengi: African Art from the Bareiss Family Collection" at the University of Iowa Museum of Art. What perhaps was most striking about the Sukuma dance figures for some visitors was that they were so unlike the African "master- pieces" we have been conditioned to expect from museum exhibitions. In this way, they are representative of the uniqueness of the exhibition as a whole in highlighting East African art. Historically, East and Southern Africa have been marginalized, even ignored, in the Western-constructed canon of African art. This situation is slowly changing. The 1995 Royal Academy exhibition "Africa: The Art of a Continent," while problematic in many ways, was successful in laying the groundwork for the inclusion of art from these two areas of the continent. That show was preceded, in 1994, by the German exhibi- tion "Tanzania: Meisterwerke Afrikanischer Skulptur/Sanaa za Mabingwa wa Kiafrika" (Berlin and Munich), with its singular focus on the arts of Tanzania. If one examines the sections taxonomized in "Kilengi" and its accompanying catalogue, the thrust of the Bareiss collection and the cura- torial agenda are quickly revealed. Following the strengths of the collection, three sections in the catalogue are devoted to East Africa, six to Central Africa, and only one to West Africa. In an article for this journal on the Bareiss collec- tion, the curator, Christopher Roy, described his journey into what to him had been the "unknown" realm of East and Central Africa: "...like Pliny discovering Africa in 79 A.D., I discovered in the Bareiss collection dozens of powerful objects that challenged the worn-out canon of 'classical' African 'masterpieces'" (African Arts, Summer 1999, p. 57). In his catalogue essay ("Reinventing the Canon: New Forms and Functions of African Art"), Roy argues against a "western invented formalist canon" and suggests the need to con- textualize objects. He explains his criteria for selecting works for the exhibition: "Objects that are well carved, that demonstrate some age and signs of local use, and that are expressive, visu- ally exciting, intellectually stimulating" (African Arts, p. 57). Yet many would define these qual- ities as characteristic of the quintessential clas- sical canon, and in some ways this statement is at odds with Roy's desire to renegotiate it. Perhaps more important than "reinventing the canon," the objects in "Kilengi" break down assumptions that privilege West Africa and relegate places like Tanzania to a "sculp- tural desert." "Kilengi," which Roy suggests derives "from several Bantu languages of east Central Africa, means the enjoyment that comes from looking at beautiful objects" (African Arts, pp. 57-58). As the title suggests, the objects in the exhibition, starting with the Sukuma dance figures that welcomed the visitor, were meant for visual consumption, and these were excit- ing examples of African art far too little seen. Consider, for example, the anthropomorphic Makonde medicinal container with skin cov- 80 STEVE TATUM, THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA MUSEUM OF ART ering, the Kamba figure with woven cloth skirt and metal ornament, and the Maasai bas- ketry-covered calabash with anthropomor- phic stopper. Little is known about some of the objects and more research is required, as is evidenced by the unidentified male-female pair from South Africa or Mozambique. It was stimulating to see examples of arts that had not been published before, and although the majority of the pieces were figural, one hopes that later collections and exhibitions will include examples of nonfigural arts from East and Southern Africa. The exhibition displayed the visual power of these objects and attempted to contextual- ize them historically and culturally within a taxonomy of six geographical areas visually distinguished in the museum by pastel wall colors: Tanzania and Kenya in light blue; Southeastern Africa in light green; South Central Africa and Southeastern Congo in yel- low; Southern and Western Congo in gray; Northern and Northeastern Congo in light orange; and West Africa in ivory. In each of these sections, the objects were geographical- ly situated by large wall maps and contextu- alized with wall labels. Additional copies of the label text were provided in folders, color coded to match the geographical areas. The exhibition catalogue included Roy's essay along with lush color plates and black- and-white photos of each object accompanied by historical and cultural information, often from obscure sources. This section of the cata- logue in particular will be an important resource for years to come; scholars can only continue to add layers of meaning to the texts surrounding the objects. The 1999 PASALA (Project for the Ad- vanced Study of Art and Life in Africa) con- ference at the University of Iowa, which was titled "Crosscurrents: Art and Power in East- ern Africa," coincided with the opening of "Kilengi" at the university's museum and was greatly enhanced by the strong presentation of East African art in the Bareiss collection. The conference provided an invaluable cross- disciplinary forum for a dialogue surround- ing issues of East African art, archaeology, film, musical traditions, and popular culture. One can only hope that conferences such as this one and exhibitions such as "Kilengi" will lay the groundwork so that the arts of East and Southern Africa will be celebrated for the richness of their traditions rather than mar- ginalized as unique.

A CONGO CHRONICLE Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art The Museum for African Art New York City April 23-August 15, 1999 Reviewed by Steven Nelson This exhibition, originally planned to accom- pany the Museum for African Art's "Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History" (1996), was an intense examination of the ways in which Congolese visual artists have worked at the crossroads of history and collective memo- ry. The nearly fifty paintings on display by Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu and others are not only politically charged examples of Congolese alrican arts ? spring 2000</page><page sequence="2">urban art; they are also history paintings which, on a fundamental level, function in a fashion similar to that of works such as Jacques Louis David's 1785 Oath of the Horatii as well as his 1793 Death of Marat. To make such a com- parison is to underscore the affective power of the included work as well as the artists' ability to deploy the past as a means to articulate a present reality. What is most striking about this history is how artists molded the figure of Patrice Lumumba, the first elected prime minister of the Congo, into a metonym for Congolese history itself. Lumumba's dramatic rise to power and meteoric fall from grace became the foundation for an art of pain, an art of suffering, and an art of catharsis. Lumumba is canonized on canvas: he is the prophet ren- dered in paint. Guest curator Bogumil Jewsiewicki de- signed the exhibition in six sections: "Urban Art: Themes and Techniques," "Lumumba: Portraits of a Leader," "Lumumba: His Rise and Fall," "Lumumba Immortalized," "The Memory, the Legacy, the Appiopliation," and "Prophetic An- cestors." An introduction to the exhibition pro- vided the viewer with a timeline of Congolese history from Henry Morgan Stanley's 1872 crossing of the Congo River to Mobutu Sese Seko's 1997 removal from power and Laurent Kabila's subsequent seizure of it. The timeline gave the visitor a cursory-and very helpful- list of paradigmatic moments in Congolese his- tory and supplied a sociopolitical frame for the work on display. As part of this theoretical ori- entation, the exhibition also included a re-cre- ated "Congo Cafe," complete with tables and chairs, its walls adorned with a mural and pop- ular paintings. There one could read news clip- pings about Lumumba dating from the 1950s to his 1961 assassination as well as view a film, comprising documentary footage and inter- views, about this political figure and his importance in Congolese art and national cul- ture. All of these things resulted in a rich exhi- bition, allowing the visitor to examine a body of painting and to learn about its sources. Jewsiewicki went to great lengths to lead the Western viewer to understand the paint- ings as they would have been perceived in their own cultural milieu. The first section, "Urban Art: Themes and Techniques," func- tioned as a primer on Congolese urban art. Along with Kalume's wonderful portrait of Lumumba, Cast Your Votefor Lumumba. Election Campaign, 1959, Jewsiewicki chose to incude a scene of colonial barbarism, two Mami Wata paintings, street scenes, a generic landscape, and a generic portrait. Wall labels for the latter two acclimated viewers to another way of see- ing and took them to another realm of experi- ence. There was also a painting with its back displayed-to show the types of canvas, or rather sacks, that were used in many of these works. Other labels helped point out their syncretic nature. The one for Tshibumba's Lumumbashi, the new Chicago, holdup of31 March 1980 explored the use and meaning of Western references in this genre. In this section, the curator also defined urban memory, calling it "a selection of themes from both the present and the past. The painter's intention is not to formulate a per- sonal view. Urban paintings give shape and form to the people's knowledge of a certain event." This statement struck me as a bit odd, since Cheri-Benga's 1993 canvas I Love Mami- Wata is a self-portrait, depicting the famed mermaid goddess seated on the shoulders of the artist. Yet the section as a whole worked as a beginning for the show, although it could have used the space more economically. In going through it, it was too easy to be led away from the main point of the exhibition: the fig- ure of Lumumba in urban art. As part of the viewer's retraining in Con- golese ways of understanding urban art as Well as the role of the artist, the labels for the paintings emphasized the titles of works rather than the artists. This was not a particu- larly successful strategy. In Western culture we often want to know who made the work before we want to know its title. To have to reeducate oneself in the very reading of labels was-at least for this Africanist art histori- an-utterly frustrating, especially because in much of our field the opportunities to lear the names of artists are so few. In the remaining sections of the exhibition, the visitor was able to use the work to explore not only the life of Lumumba as depicted in paint but also the ways in which a body politic has been haunted by and inflected through memory. These canvases show how memory plays with the factual, reinterpreting it for other means. They articulated political opposition to the Mobutu regime, the pain of Lumumba's fall, and his ensuing martyrdom. One of the most powerful works was Tshibumba's 1970s canvas Zaire Independence, June 30, 1960, in- cluded in the section "Lumumba: His Rise and Fall." Here, Tshibumba used the inflammatory speech Lumumba had given in the presence of King Baudouin and the newly elected Congolese Parliament to create a tableau which retrospectively tapped into the elation of the newly emancipated state. He included some of the stock icons of politically charged Congolese urban art: Lumumba with a globe showing Africa, broken chains of slavery, and a hand upraised in victory. Like the paintings around it, it does not attempt to report an event per se, but rather to articulate its significance, a signif- icance that had a very charged meaning under the regime of Mobutu, which for many was interpreted as a return to slavery. A case on the opposite wall contained pho- tographs and news clippings of Lumumba's speech and the outrage it caused in the West. Above this were three Congolese paintings, ruminations on the panicked white response to Lumumba's charges. Given the importance of this event in the Congolese psyche, this dis- play would have been made even more pow- erful with the inclusion of a painting of the speech itself. One of the striking things about this body of work was the attention given to the audi- ence. In Abio's Lumumba Signing the Congo Declaration of Independence, the book Lumumba signed is upside down so that the viewer can easily read it. Many of these works-as in his- tory painting more generally-are not only political statements but also didactic tools, meant to educate the viewer to the significance of the past. In the realm of political protest, to educate could be seen as being a route to politi- cization as well as a way to make citizens. The final two sections, "The Memory, the Legacy, the Appropriation" and "Prophetic Ancestors," most overtly showed the place of Lumumba as a present-day symbol. In the Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu. Le 30 Juin 1960, Zaire Independant (Zaire Independence, June 30, 1960). Oil on fabric, 45cm x 62.2cm (17.75' x 24.6"). Bol Collection. spring 2000 ? african arts 81</page><page sequence="3">former section, some of the paintings made explicit metaphorical connections between Lumumba and heroes, present and past. Others represented Kabila as the new Lumumba, a leader breaking the chains of slavery under Mobutu. In the latter section, Jewsiewicki attempted to place Lumumba within an ex- isting Congolese practice of creating heroic visual icons. As powerful as many of these canvases are, some of their evocative force was lost in the manner of presentation. On one wall there were just too many pieces crowded together and grouped in a salon-like fashion; some of them were hung so high that they were diffi- cult to see. It was also difficult to figure out what some of the works were, as they were too far away from their labels. In addition, it was not always clear when one was moving from one section to another. Upon leaving the exhibition, I also had questions about the authorship and prove- nance of many of the works. A good number of the paintings were made by an artist who would sign another's name. It would have been helpful to know the reasons for this prac- tice. Was it economic? Were some artists get- ting better prices? Few of the labels revealed provenance. As a specialist, I assumed that those without such information belonged to Jewsiewicki, but the omission might have been confusing to a nonspecialist. As a whole, the execution of the exhibition did not live up to the show itself. "A Congo Chronicle" quite successfully raised provocative questions surrounding the relationship between facts and how they are col- lectively remembered. At times, however, there seemed to be an unstated desire to show the dif- ference between "real" facts and the artist's interpretation of them. Next to Tshibumba's canvas The Martyrs of Independence, January 4, 1959, the curator notes, "Tshibumba represents Lumumba as a leader of the January 4, 1959, riots although he was not directly involved." Such an "explanation," a sort of correction of the artist, undermined the evocative force of the piece. The factual is not important here. The ways in which it is understood is. On that level, should the exhibition have been called a "chron- icle," a record of events in the order that they happened? Perhaps not. Nevertheless, and to Jewsiewicki's credit, "A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art" was an important exhibition, revealing how, in a specific cultural milieu, memory as a visual language weaves complex metaphors that articulate the relation between past and present, tradition and modernity, and Africa and the West. The paintings on display are powerful, syncretic tableaus in which these oppositions come together on canvas to articulate changing social values, and they showed how the past can be utilized as a powerful tool in the construction of a present reality.
