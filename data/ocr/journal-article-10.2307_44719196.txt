Rudd and David Lessley University of Virginia Copyright © 2002 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT This paper presents a load distribution-specific viscoelastic structural characterization of the Hybrid III 50th percentile male anthropomorphic test dummy thorax. The dummy is positioned supine on a high- speed material testing machine and ramp-and-hold tests are performed using a distributed load, a hub load, and a diagonal belt load applied to the anterior thorax of the dummy. The force-deflection response is shown to be linear viscoelastic for all loading conditions when the internal dummy instrumentation is used to measure chest deflection. When an externally measured displacement (i.e., a measurement that includes the superficial skin material) is used for the characterization, a quasiiinear viscoelastic characterization is necessary. Linear and quasilinear viscoelastic model coefficients are presented for all three loading conditions. The elastic functions show that, for a given displacement, the diagonal belt loading condition generates the highest elastic force, followed by the distributed loading condition, and the hub loading condition. It is concluded that the area of force application is of secondary importance and that the specific structures engaged (e.g., the shoulder assembly) are more important in dictating the structural response. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND THORACIC INJURY AND INJURY PREDICTION IN AUTOMOBILE COLLISIONS - Thoracic trauma is a contributing factor in nearly 70% of all vehicular collision deaths and disabling injuries, and is the principle causative factor in approximately 30% (Mulligan et al. 1994). In passenger vehicle collisions, chest injuries rank second only to head injuries in overall number of fatalities and serious injuries (Cavanaugh in Nahum and Melvin 1993); they also rank second to head injuries in overall societal harm (Malliaris 1985). While the thorax may be injured in any type of impact, including side impacts, rear impacts, and rollovers, the design of many vehicle components is dictated at least partially by the requirement to reduce thoracic injury risk in a frontal collision. For example, deform instrument panels and stroking steering columns absorb energy during occupant loading and reduce thoracic injury risk for belted and unbelted occupants. Belt restraints reduce occupant excursion within the vehicle during an impact and reduce the relative velocity between the occupant and interior components. Belt restraints also strain under load, performing work on the occupant and increasing the time available for the occupant to reach a common velocity with the vehicle. Airbags dissipate the occupant's kinetic energy through venting and provide a distributed load to the thorax, thereby reducing localized areas of high stress. The efficacy of these occupant protection systems is assessed using a variety of tools. Human volunteer, human cadaver, or animal tests may be performed to compare restraint characteristics. These types of tests are typically expensive, laborious and of limited repeatability, so anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) are often used as surrogates for humans. These ATDs are instrumented to measure various parameters, including sternal displacement relative to the spine (chest deflection) and the rate of chest deflection. Chest compression, defined as the chest deflection divided by the initial chest depth, is also a common parameter. These and other parameters, or combinations thereof, are correlated with the presence of injury and used as predictors of thoracic injury risk for a given occupant, restraint condition, and set of impact characteristics. Injury criteria, developed in this manner, are then used for the assessment of restraint systems both prospectively (i.e., during the design process) and retrospectively (i.e., during consumer information tests or government compliance tests). Effective assessment and comparison of safety systems therefore requires ATDs that respond in a human-like manner, and injury criteria that are capable of differentiating among design options. HYBRID III DUMMY AS HUMAN SURROGATE - The Hybrid III 50th percentile male is the ATD most often used to assess injury potential for frontal impact restraint loading. The testing performed for the development of the Hybrid III ATD is summarized elsewhere (Schneider et al. 1989) and therefore the subject will not be 199</page><page sequence="2">presented in detail here. A brief overview of the testing is appropriate, however, since it illustrates the loading conditions for which the dummy is intended and also illustrates the developmental limitations of the ATD. The primary source of data used in the development of the Hybrid III is the test series presented by Kroell et al. (1971, 1974), supplemented by tests and analyses presented by Neathery (1974), Patrick (1981), and others (see Melvin and Weber 1988). The Kroell tests involved a circular, 15.3 cm diameter rigid impactor striking human cadavers at the level of the fourth interstitial space and were performed over a range of impact speeds (4.3 m/s to 10 m/s). The dummy was designed primarily as an injury assessment tool for chest/steering wheel impacts and chest/instrument panel impacts (Schneider et al. 1989). As a result, the primary design target for the chest response was the 6.7 m/s Kroell tests, with a secondary goal of meeting the 4.3 m/s corridor (Schneider et al. 1989). At the time the Hybrid III was being developed, very little test data were available for loading conditions other than the Kroell frontal, midsternal, blunt impactor condition. In response to this limitation of the Hybrid III, development work began in 1986 on an enhanced chest assembly (TAD) for the Hybrid III (Schneider et al. 1989). One of the goals with the TAD was to reprioritize the design specifications for the chest response. Matching the Kroell 4.3 m/s corridor became the primary goal, matching quasi-static tests similar to the Kroell tests (Stalnaker et al. 1 973, Lobdell et al. 1 973) became the secondary goal, and the 6.7 m/s corridor became the lowest priority. In addition, other loading types were considered, including belt tests presented by Melvin and Weber (1988) and L'Abbe et al. (1982), airbag tests (Gheng et al. 1982), and impactor tests performed with a larger surface area (340 cm2 and 500 cm2) than the Kroell tests (Schneider et al. 1989). Geometric and anatomical enhancements were also made, and measurement capability was expanded. This enhanced chest, a derivative of which has shown encouraging performance in biofidelity assessment tests (Shaw et al. 2000) is, however, still under development and has therefore not been incorporated into the Hybrid III dummy. As a result, federal compliance tests and new car assessment tests, in addition to restraint design and development tests, still rely on the Hybrid III thoracic response. It is necessary, therefore, to quantify the Hybrid III thorax over a range of loading rates when the force distribution on the chest is varied. A viscoelastic structural model, developed for different loading conditions, is a robust way to evaluate the load distribution dependency of the dummy's response. A viscoelastic material model is typically developed in terms of stress and strain using a continuum assumption for the material of interest. For the purposes of characterizing the gross response of the thorax, a structural model will be developed in terms of the applied force and the resulting mid-sternal chest compression since the compression is a good indicator of injury and the applied force-time history can often be estimated for a particular restraint/occupant/impact configuration. The models developed here, then, rather than being general constitutive descriptions of a material are simply the load-deflection characteristics of the thorax developed using a convenient viscoelastic formulation. As described above, the thoracic force-deformation characteristics developed in the past have used a less general form. Typically, a series of impact tests is performed at a given impact velocity and the resulting force and chest deflection are cross-plotted. The thoracic response is then bounded by performing tests on several different subjects and forming corridors that contain the individual responses (e.g., Kroell 1994). These corridors are then developed at discrete impact velocities (or impact energy levels) to describe the rate sensitivity of the thorax. The use of a viscoelastic form allows for a more generalized description of the response, since the force response to any deflection- time history can be determined. The viscoelastic characterization is also unique with respect to the apportionment of the elastic and viscous contributions to the force resulting from an applied displacement. VISCOELASTICITY THEORY - The response of many solid materials is modeled using classical elastic theory, which states that, as long as the deformations are small, the resulting stress is proportional to the applied strain and is independent of the strain rate. Some characteristics of elastic materials are that the force- deformation curve will follow the same path during loading and unloading (no energy dissipation), the deformation to an applied load is independent of the duration of the loading (no creep), and the force response to an applied step displacement is constant (no relaxation). In contrast, the stress response of a viscous fluid is often modeled to be proportional to the strain rate, but not the magnitude of the strain. Thus, one characteristic of a viscous fluid is that the stress response to a sinusoidal displacement input is 90° out of phase with the displacement. Each of these classical theories, however, does not adequately describe a large class of real solid materials. Many solids exhibit characteristics of both an elastic solid and a viscous fluid (i.e., they are sensitive to both the rate of strain and the magnitude of strain). The behavior of these types of materials is described using viscoelastic theory. A viscoelastic solid is characterized by both an elastic response and an energy-dissipating viscous flow response. Thus, a viscoelastic solid exhibits some amount of hysteresis, creep, creep recovery, and relaxation. As a result, the entire time history of strain affects the stress. Depending on the characteristics of a material, the form of the viscoelastic model used to describe it can include multiple spring and dashpot elements arranged singly, in series, or in parallel. The elastic and viscous 200</page><page sequence="3">characteristics of biological solids have often been described using a Maxwell model consisting of an elastic element in parallel with one or more Maxwell elements (Figure 1 ), where the characteristics of the springs and characteristics T Thorax / di d2 dß Figure 1 : Maxwell model of the viscoelastic thorax. the dashpots are material-specific. The force-deflection response of this model can be described using a differential equation for the force in terms of the time derivatives of the deflection. Experimental determination of the material constants, however, is facilitated by a hereditary integral description of the material's response to an applied step in deflection. The hereditary integral formulation results from the rule of linear superposition (see Flügge 1 967). For the ATD's thorax, consider the case of several displacements of different magnitudes applied successively. The force response is a function of the magnitude of each applied displacement and of all displacements prior to it. If the limiting case of a series of infinitesimal displacements is considered, the result is the hereditary integral description of the structural response: F(t) = J F„(t-r)^dr õt [1] õt where FR(t-x) is the relaxation function of the material, c(t) is the chest deflection divided by the initial chest depth, and F(t) is the force response to the applied displacement. No generality is lost with this description of the system (i.e., the hereditary integral contains all of the information in the differential equation). Developed to facilitate experimental determination of material constants, Fung's theory of quasilinea viscoelasticity (QLV) assumes function can be divided into a strain-dependent function and a time-dependent function (Fung 1981): FR(c,t) = G(t)-Felastic(c) [2] where Felastic(c) is the instantaneous elastic function (i.e., the force response to an instantaneously applied step displacement) and G(t) is a normalized, or reduced, relaxation function, which is a monotonically decreasing function of time. The elastic function may assume a nonlinear form and, for biological materials subjected to finite strains, a nonlinear form of the elastic response is usually required. Despite this nonlinearity in the force response of the material, the principle of superposition remains valid due to the assumption of time linearity, and the resulting hereditary integral is a general description of the response of a QLV material: F(t). 'l J G(«-r)02Í£)]É2(£)dr [31. J ÕC ÕT - 00 This convolution integral can be solved for the force response to any applied displacement time history. METHODS A 50th percentile male Hybrid III ATD was positioned supine on a fixed, rigid surface and subjected to an anterior-posterior ramp displacement using a materials testing (MTS) machine. The maximum loading rate for the MTS is approximately 30 cm/sec, which resulted in a chest compression rate of approximately 170%/sec. This generated 25% chest compression in approximately 150 ms - approximately twice the time required to reach that level of compression in a 48 km/h frontal impact with a belt restraint. An analytical technique, discussed in greater detail in the Viscoelastic Characterization section, was used to estimate the effect of the time constants that had decayed during this relatively slow (quasidynamic) ramp. Three different loading conditions were used (Figure 2): distributed loading (test H3VE1), hub loading (test H3VE3), and diagonal belt loading (test H3VE6). For the distributed loading condition and the diagonal belt loading condition, a cable-and-pulley system was used to apply the displacement. The distributed load was applied using a rectangular (203 mm by 432 mm) belt with a medial-lateral orientation on the subject (Figure 3a). The belt was attached to cables at either end, which fed through pulleys mounted to the plate behind the subject. The center of the belt was positioned midsternally at the level of the nipple. The limitations of the test setup precluded the application of force over the entire anterior surface of the thorax. As a result, unlike the loading from an automotive airbag, the most superior portion of the thorax was not loaded. For the diagonal belt loading condition, the pulley system and the upper loading arm were rotated 45°. The 201</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2: Schematic depictions of the three loading conditions used for the structural characterization tests. diagonal belt load was applied using a 51 mm wide belt oriented nominally 45° from the mldsagittal plane (Figure 3b). The belt passed over the shoulder and extended over the sternum, resulting In a diagonal belt orientation similar to automotive seatbelt loading (Figure 2c and Figure 3b). The hub load was applied with a 152 mm diameter steel circular plate, intended to mimic the most common loading surface described by Kroell (1994) (Figure 3c). In all tests, a force transducer was mounted between the posterior reaction surface and the base of the materials testing machine. The force measured by this transducer was assumed to be the force applied to the thorax. During preliminary testing, an accelerometer was mounted to the actuator to determine whether inertial effects were significant in this loading environment. The acceleration levels attained by the actuator were below 10 g's, so all inertial forces were neglected. The MTS platform displacement was measured using a linear potentiometer. Figure 3: Pretest photographs for alt ATD loading conditions (legs removed). 202</page><page sequence="5">The thorax was subjected to a ramp compression, which was held for ten seconds, then released. After waiting at least ten seconds for recovery, a second ramp, with approximately 75% of the displacement of the first ramp, was held for at least ten seconds. The two magnitudes were necessary for the evaluation of temporal nonlinearity (i.e., the reduced relaxation function must be independent of compression in order for QLV to apply). Ten seconds, which is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than any time range for which this model is desired, was assumed to capture all of the behavior of interest. Longer time behavior is not of interest since the dummy is used to study impact loading. It was assumed, therefore, that the response at 10 seconds was equal to the response at infinite time. In all tests, the system was preloaded to approximately 50 N to remove slack from the cables and to provide a common starting point for all loading conditions. The displacement-time history of the MTS platform and the geometry of the cable system were used to determine the external displacement-time history of the mid- sternum. In addition, the standard internal sternal potentiometer (slider) and a sternal string potentiometer array were used to measure internal chest displacement. The chest compression data will be presented as the externally measured or the internally measured sternal deflection divided by the initial, external, anterior- posterior chest depth, measured midsagittally at the level of the center of the loaded area (i.e., the nipple). The internal dummy deflection instruments do not include deformations of the superficial dummy skin, so comparison of the internal deflection measurements and the external deflection measurements defines the contributions of the dummy skin material to the overall thoracic response. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The Hybrid III response was found to be sensitive to the loading condition. For a given compression, the distributed loading condition and the diagonal belt loading condition generated more force than the hub condition (Figure 4). The externally measured force- deflection response exhibited slight nonlinearity as the skin material was compressed, while the force-deflection response based on the internal deflection measurement was linear. The thorax exhibited viscoelastic relaxation for all loading conditions (Figure 5). From this force-time data plot, the hub loading condition clearly resulted in more relaxation than the diagonal belt condition. Visually comparing the relaxation response for these two loading conditions with the distributed loading condition is difficult in Figure 5, however, since the magnitude of the applied force differs. VISCOELASTIC CHARACTERIZATION ELASTIC FUNCTION - The first step in a viscoelastic characterization of the above data is the determination of a function to describe adequately the relationship of the measured force to the applied compression form of Felas"°(c)). Several nonlinear constitutive forms have been used to model the deformation response of biological tissues. Perhaps the simplest, most commonly used form for large, uniaxial deformations is Fung's (1981) exponential form: Fe|as«c (c) = A • [Exp(B • c) - 1] [4a] where A and B are constants determined from experimental data. This form was found to be an adequate model of the externally measured thoracic force-compression response for all loading conditions. In the case of the externally measured Hybrid III chest compression, the nonlinear form was sufficiently better than a linear fit to justify its use (Figure 6). For the internal compression measurement, a linear elastic function was chosen: Felasti0(c) = Ac [4b], The effect of this assignment is that the force-internal compression characterization is a linear viscoelastic model, though the separable elastic and relaxation functions will be maintained to facilitate the numerical convolution technique described below. Figure 4: Force-compression results for the ATD using external deflection (upper plot) and the slider deflection (lower plot) for three loading conditions. Note that the diagonal belt condition was tested to a lower level of compression than the other conditions. 203</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5: Force-time results for the ATD - three loading conditions. Figure 6: Comparison of nonlinear and linear curve fits to Hybrid III force-compression data. As mentioned above, the loading rate used in these quasidynamic tests was approximately a factor of two lower than the rate that a restrained torso is loaded in a typical, 48 km/h sled test. This obviously has implications for a rate-sensitive characterization of the torso. In a QLV description of the response, the effect of a lower loading rate is that shorter time behavior, which is significant at higher loading rates, may have decayed by the time the maximum displacement has occurred at the lower loading rate. A QLV model fitting procedure, originally described by Martin (2001), can be used to estimate these shorter-time constants. MODEL FITTING PROCEDURE - Consider the definition of a QLV force response, F, to an applied step displacement, c0H(t) (where H(t) is the Heaviside step function): F(c0,t) = G(t)-Felastio(c0), where G(0) = 1 [5], Determining the true value of Felastlc(c0) is not possible experimentally because a step displacement cannot be applied over an infinitesimally small time. The elastic response must be determined experimentally using a displacement applied over a small, but finite, interval. Thus, the instantaneous force is approximated by: pelastic/ç ' ^ F(c0,tmin) ° G(U) where tmin is a theoretically attainable experimental rise time for the applied ramp displacement. If tmin represents the highest loading rate environment in which the material model will be applied, then only longer-time behavior (i.e., force at t &gt; tmin) is of concern and Equation [6] is an adequate approximation of the instantaneous elastic response. Unfortunately, the limitations of the MTS machine used in the thorax characterization tests were such that the experimental rise time, tmeas, was greater than a time range of interest. The experimentally measured forces may therefore underestimate the force at higher loading rates during the early force response (i.e., stress at t ź tmeas) because the force may have relaxed during the rise time In order to approximate the elastic stress response associated with higher loading rates, the experimental force must be scaled by some unknown, time-varying, value, A(t): p elastic /n ' ^ F(Co,tm¡n) F(c0,tmeas) (Co,~"G(n /n ' ^ min / g Tt meas r / min / meas / *A(t)-F(c0,tmeas) [7], So, the scaling factor, A(t), is the ratio of the reduced relaxation functions: t8] ^(^meas / and Fmeas(c0) = F(c0,tmeas) is the measured force response to c0 applied over the finite rise time tmeas. Using the approximation of Equation [7], A(t) Fmeas(co) serves as the elastic function in the hereditary QLV integral of Equation [3]. An iterative approach may be used to solve for A(t) using the entire time history of a set of experimentally derived data. The measured force is scaled by A(t) at each point in time and the relaxation coefficients are found that best fit the scaled data over the entire time history. The scaling function is partitioned into stretch and relaxation components: r G(t a)/G(t), 0 &lt; t &lt;tmeas (stretch) A(t)= i [9] L Gémeas ' a)/G(tmeas ), tmeas &lt; t (relax) where the factor a represents a loading rate greater than that obtained experimentally. Funk et al. (2001 ) showed that a ten-fold increase in strain rate (a = 0.1) could be adequately modeled using the above technique. 204</page><page sequence="7">This iterative solution technique requires a numerical description of the model. Representing the reduced relaxation function as a parallel assortment of Maxwell elements, a convolution algorithm can be used to determine the force at time Vi given a past history of deformation to time tj and an incremental displacement: t+dt elastic F(c,t + dt)= J (GjExpf-ßj (t + dt - r )] + )-z - d r 0 vT t op elastic t op elastic = GiExpi-ßidt) ÍExp[- ßj(t - t)]- d t + Gœ f- d t + 0 dT 0 dT t+dt op elastic t+dt op elastic G, jExp^it + dt-r)]^- op dr + G„ * f ^^-dr op tJ or * or = Exp( -ßidt) • S, (c, t) + S.

DETERMINATION OF MODEL COEFFICIENTS - To fit the experimental data adequately, three exponential terms were necessary in the reduced relaxation function: G(t) = ¿GlExp(-W)+G„ [14] i=1 where the coefficients G¡ and G» were normalized so that their sum is unity. A numerical iteration scheme was used to solve for the coefficients subject to t restriction that the reciprocal of the shortest constant, 1/ß3, was on the order of the experimental rise time divided by ten (i.e., the model cannot be applied at loading rates more than one order of magnitude greater than the experimental loading rate). As a result, ß3 was in the range of 44 s"1 to 75 s" in all cases. This limitation is not dictated by the numerical scheme. Rather, this is the greatest increase in loading rate for which the technique has experimental corroboration (Funk et al. 2001). Constraining the value of 1/ß3 also allows for the use of a constant value for a, which simplifies the curve fitting procedure. Thus, the entire QLV model consisted of nine coefficients (two for the elastic function and seven for the reduced relaxation function). All nine coefficients were determined for each loading condition. The procedure for determining these coefficients was as follows: 1. The elastic model of Equation [4] was fit to the elastic portion of the force-compression curve (i.e., the portion of the curve prior to the hold portion) using a non-linear (for externally measured compression) or a linear (for internal) regression scheme that minimized the mean square error (MSE) between the function and the measured values. 2. The reduced relaxation function coefficients were determined by minimizing the MSE between the calculated force-time-compression response and the entire measured force-time-compression history. 3. The elastic portion of the force-compression curve was multiplied by A(t) to approximate the elastic response that would be obtained if the test had been performed at an order of magnitude greater rate. 4. The elastic model of Equation [4] was fit to these scaled data using non-linear regression or linear regression, depending on the compression measurement used. 5. The model coefficient(s) found using the scaled elastic data and the reduced relaxation function coefficients found in step 2 are the final model parameters. The final model is assumed to be applicable at a loading rate ten times greater than the experimental loading rate. RESULTS OF MODEL DEVELOPMENT - The elastic response of the dummy was found to vary among loading conditions, in the magnitude of both the linear coefficient, A, and, where applicable, the nonlinear coefficient, B (Table 1). With the external compression measurement, the distributed condition and the diagonal belt condition had similar elastic responses (Figure 7, left plot), while the hub loading condition was less stiff elastically. The hub loading condition also decayed more quickly than the other two loading conditions (Table 2 and Figure 7, right plot) and had a lower value of G„. The diagonal belt condition exhibited the least long-time relaxation, and also decayed more slowly than the other two loading conditions. With the internal compression measurement, the distributed condition and the diagonal belt condition 205</page><page sequence="8">again had similar elastic responses (Figure 8, left plot), while the hub loading condition was less stiff elastically. The hub loading condition also decayed more quickly than the other two loading conditions (Table 2 and Figure 8, right plot) and had a lower value of G«. The distributed condition exhibited the least long-time relaxation, and also decayed more slowly than the other two loading conditions.

The specific structures engaged have a pronounced effect. For example, the diagonal belt loading condition, while it involved only approximately 250 cm2 of loaded area, generated approximately equal or more force for a given compression than the hub (which is to be expected since the hub engaged only approximately 180 cm2) or, more surprisingly, the distributed load, which engaged approximately 730 cm2. The diagonal belt engaged the shoulder structure, which was not engaged by either of the other two loading conditions. In addition, the diagonal belt condition engaged a large percentage of the superior-inferior dimension of the rib cage that, combined with the geometric orientation of the belt with respect to the long axes of the ribs, resulted in efficient superior-inferior load sharing among ribs. The finding that diagonal belt loading increases the elastic stiffness and reduces force relaxation relative to hub loading is supported by previous research (e.g., Bouquet and Cesari 1994). This effect has also been observed for the human thorax. Fayon et al. (1975) observed that thoracic stiffness under diagonal belt loading was approximately 1 .5 times the stiffness under hub loading in quasistatic tests of human volunteers. The elastic responses to the various loading conditions can therefore be reasonably well understood in terms of the structures bearing the force. The interpretation of the viscous findings is not as straightforward. There is a marked difference among the three loading conditions. Note, for example, that the chest exhibits more force relaxation under hub loading than under the other conditions. There is also a noticeable effect from consideration of the skin material. In fact, the ranking of loading condition in terms of force relaxation is not equivalent for the external and internal compression measurement (Figure 7 and Figure 8). At this point, the observed viscous responses cannot be completely explained in terms of the dummy construction and we conclude only that the Hybrid III chest does exhibit force relaxation and that the magnitude of the relaxation depends on the loading condition. It is important to consider that the models developed here do not include the inertial contribution to the thoracic force. The acceleration levels attained with the MTS machine were insufficient to generate large inertial forces and the constrained-back condition precluded acceleration of a significant percentage of the thoracic mass. In support of this statement, consider Figure 9, which compares the measured force and the model- predicted force for two triangular displacement inputs having approximately an order of magnitude difference in loading rate. The model prediction matches the measured force equally well in both cases, indicating that an inertial term in the model Is not necessary. Figure 9: Comparison of measured force and predicted force for slow (upper plot) and fast (lower plot) triangular displacement time-histories (internal compression measurements). The inertial contributions to the dynamic force-deflection response can be large, however - especially for the high-rate hub impact loading that has been used for much of the thorax characterization and model validation studies performed to date. For example, consider specimen 51 FM presented by Kroell et al. (1974). This test involved a back-constrained cadaver loaded by a 10.4 kg hub translating at 6.7 m/s. The sternal accelerometer measured 1200 g's approximately 1.8 ms after contact. For a reasonable effective sternal mass (Lobdell et al. (1973) proposed 0.32 kg), such a large acceleration undoubtedly contributed a significant amount to the measured force on the hub, which was approximately 3700 N at 1.8 ms. In fact, an effective mass of 0.32 kg accelerated at 1200 g's would generate a force of 3767 N - indicating that the early force peak may have been due only to inertia. It is not possible to apportion that measured force among the elastic, viscous, and inertial contributions, however, because the effective masses, stiffnesses, and damping characteristics of the torso can not be determined uniquely using the data available from those tests. Lobdell et al. (1973) presented a lumped-parameter model of the human chest based on the hub tests, in which they attempted to assign the inertial, elastic and viscous characteristics. The parameters of the model were determined using an iterative approach that 207</page><page sequence="10">converged to a non-unique set of effective mass, stiffness, and damping characteristics that matched the measured cadaver force-deflection corridor for two test conditions. Constant values were found for the effective masses, nriļ and m2. This model and its validation corridors are currently the primary source of validation data for new ATDs and computational human thorax models, including multibody models and finite element models. A more robust validation could be obtained if the elastic, viscous, and inertial contributions to the applied force could be determined. The models presented here provide a means to apportion these parameters since the inertial effects are not included in the models and the elastic and viscous characteristics are separated in the QLV formulation. Whether the dummy can mimic the human equally well for different types of restraint loading is of critical importance when a matched dummy-human strategy is used to develop an injury criterion. If the dummy's biofidelity depends upon the restraint condition, and the injury criterion being analyzed may depend upon the restraint condition, it becomes difficult to separate the two effects when the dummy is used to predict human injury for diverse restraint types. LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT The use of the scaling technique to estimate the short- time response is a limitation of the study. But, by allowing the short-time response to be estimated from a quasi-dynamic test (i.e., a test in which the inertial contribution is small), this scaling technique is the means by which the inertial responses were separated from the elastic and viscous responses. Several assumptions about the physical phenomenon are required when using this technique. The relationships in Equation [7] are approximations and the factor a was assigned based on previously developed ranges of applicability for this technique (Funk et al. 2001). Therefore, it would be useful to have validation data obtained at the higher loading rates since the validation studies presented by Funk et al. for human skin, while an indication of the utility of the methodology, have not been shown to be applicable to the torso. The use of a constrained back condition may result in different response than a thorax loaded only by its inertia, as it is in automotive frontal impacts. The effect of the posterior boundary is assumed to be limited to a possible increase in elastic stiffness due to constraint of rib motion. This increase cannot be quantified using the data presented here. In addition, the anterior boundary condition is not an exact representation of the restraint loading in an automotive environment. This limitation is likely of less importance for this dummy-based characterization than it would be for a human-based characterization, however, since the Hybrid III does not have the costavertebral articulations of a human. The use of the cable-pulley system is another limitation of this study because the pulley friction was present two of the loading conditions (distributed and diagonal belt), but not in the third (hub loading). This biases the elastic functions to a degree that cannot be quantified. Future research, which will involve comparison of dummy and cadaver responses in this test environment, will include improved experimental methodologies to remove this limitation. CONCLUSIONS The force-deflection response of the Hybrid III thorax depends on both the rate at which the load is applied as well as the specific thoracic structures that are engaged. When the force is distributed such that the shoulder and rib cage share the load, the mid-sternal deflection is less than when the force is distributed to the ribs alone. From these results, which show a stiffer elastic response for a narrow, diagonal belt than for a well-distributed force indicate that the area of load application is less important than the specific structures that are engaged. When an external compression measurement is used, a QLV model is necessary to characterize the response. On the other hand, when the standard, internal sternal potentiometer (slider) is used as the compression measurement, a linear viscoelastic model is sufficient. Matching the 6.7 m/s hub corridors (or even multiple corridors) is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for biofidelity. The dummy and human may match in those tests because, for example, the primarily inertial response of the Hybrid III matches the primarily viscous response of the cadavers - so the dummy's force- deflection response appears biofidelic for that specific set of conditions. The methodology outlined here could be used as a more robust assessment of biofidelity. The optimal technique for a load distribution-specific assessment of dummy biofidelity is to test both human cadavers and the dummy with varied loading conditions but, unlike the study presented here, decrease the time over which the ramp displacement is applied and perform the tests with a posterior reaction that does not constrain the costovertebral articulations. While there are obvious experimental difficulties with such an approach, it would provide for a robust assessment of viscous and elastic contributions to thoracic response and therefore a unique description of biofidelity. These experimental difficulties may be overcome with a posterior reaction apparatus that engages, for example, only the spine, pelvis, and extremities such that the costovertebral articulations are not constrained and by using a higher speed material testing machine than the one used for these tests. This research is currently ongoing and is intended to expand on the conclusions drawn in this preliminary study.
