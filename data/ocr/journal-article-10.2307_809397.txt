<plain_text><page sequence="1">For Individual Reading EDITED BY G. ROBERT CARLSEN TELEVISION WORKS LIKE THIS. By Jeanne and Robert Bendick. New York: Whittlesey, 1954. Pp. 64. $2.25. (Revised edition) In simple language with many dia- grams and line drawings, the Bendicks tell precisely how television operates both from the mechanical and the productional sides. The first edition of the book has already proved an immense success with young readers. The present volume adds some of the pertinent advances, particu- larly in the area of colored television. It would not be a bad idea if all English teachers were required to read this short volume so that they might converse a little more coherently with the young scientists in their classes. Certainly if you are teach- ing a unit on the mass media of communi- cation, this book will be indispensable. MOUNTED POLICE PATROL. By Roderick Haig-Brown. New York: Mor- row, 1954. Pp. 248. $2.75. When Dave Sloane's parents suddenly die, he finds himself uprooted from his Toronto slum life, where a cop was a con- stant enemy, and sent to live with an uncle in Western Canada who is a Cana- dian Mounted Policeman. While he is in- stinctively drawn to his Uncle Ken, he cannot quite root out his suspicion of policemen. As a consequence he fights an inner battle with himself which is re-</page><page sequence="2">476 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL solved against the background of modern police work. This is an excellent story on many counts: it deals with the conflict of values in a teenager's mind, a conflict real to many boys. It is an exciting adventure story laid in the ruggedness of Western Canada. It gives a good working picture of the kind of duties a modern police officer performs in a semi-rural com- munity today. In this last phase, it may well stand as an excellent vocational story. Possible interests: Values, Canada, police work. POWDER AND HIDES. By Val Gendron. New York: Longmans, 1954. Pp. 230. $3.00. Johnny Doane, son of an Army officer stationed at Dodge City, persuades the old mountain man, Jed Hardy, to take him on the last of the big buffalo hunts in the year 1873. Having grown up with typical fort attitudes toward the buffalo, the country, and particularly the Indians, Johnny's experience with Jed is a liberal education. He comes to despise the slaughter of the buffalo. He feels for the first time the tremendous beauty and power of the country, and he develops a real respect for the Indian as a human being. Probably the most thrilling incident in the book is the capture _of a band of wild horses from which Johnny chooses a beautiful golden stallion. This is a magnificient book. Though it deals with much-used subject matter, it treats it in an entirely new way, trying to interpret the broad movements of Ameri- can history, to show the beauty of the country as well as delineating the proc- esses that mature a young man. Possible interests: The West, Ameri- can history, maturation, man's role. THE SCIENCE BOOK OF WONDER DRUGS. By Donald G. Cooley. New York: Watts, 1954. Pp. 247. $2.95. Here is a simple straightforward ac- count of the whole group of modern drugs that have become household prod- ucts in the last fifteen years. The author tells of the exciting discoveries of the drugs, their development for extensive use. He describes how they work and what they are good for. There are three major groups described extensively: sul- phas, antiobiotics, and hormones. In ad- dition there is some account of the ad- vances in treating cancer, controlling vi- ruses, and the like. The book is marred by a very slow moving and somewhat dull introductory chapter, but after that it has the kind of reading that will be appealing to many potential scientists in classes. It may well serve as a good source of composition ma- terial for such students. THE MOTHER DITCH. By Oliver La Farge. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1954. Pp. 50. $2.25. Irrigation in the Southwest is the sub- ject of this short book. Told through pic- tures and simple text, it is the story of how the Spanish, the Anglos, and the Indians irrigate their fields and make the desert productive in the small community of Cerrito, just outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. While the account is primarily factual, one is introduced to the Romero family and feels that one lives with them through the growing season. Though intended primarily for the upper grades, this book has a dignity and beauty that will move any reader. It exudes a feeling for the nobility of the lives of the Spanish-American farmers and for the magnificence of the country. Don't miss it. Possible interests: New Mexican cul- ture, rural life, Spanish-Americans, ir- rigation. BANNER IN THE SKY. By James Ramsey Ullman. Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1954. Pp. 252. $2.75. Rudi Matt, the physically small son of a great mountain climber of the village of Kurtal, wants more than anything else to</page><page sequence="3">TEACHING MATERIALS 477 conquer the Citadel, the unclimbed peak that claimed his father's life. He is kept from climbing by his mother, who does not want a repetition of her husband's fate. But Rudi nevertheless runs away secretly to the mountains and eventually joins Captain Winters, who is determined to climb the unscaled peak. The story settles down to the superb adventure of the scaling of the peak and the human innuendoes that go with the task. While Rudi does not get quite to the top he conquers several things in himself. After getting off to a slow start, this is an excellent adventure story. Ullman does not ever let us down in writing of mountains and what they mean to man. Rudi's rebellion against his mother and uncle who would hold him back, his fail- ure even to do what Captain Winter com- mands him to will appeal to the adolescent, though they are somewhat questionable incidents in the adult's mind. Barring those incidents, this is unquestionably a fine boy's story, the best, perhaps, of this year's crop. Possible interests: Mountain climbing, Switzerland, independence. SHANE. By John McCormack. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1954. Pp. 214. $2.75. The story of Shane is told through the eyes of a boy, the son of a Wyoming farmer in the days of the struggle be- tween the homesteaders and the cattle barons. Shane was a strong man who came from nowhere, bringing with him a sense of great power. He stayed with the Starretts, drawn to them by deep respect, and he helped them in their final battle with Fletcher, the cattleman who wanted to drive them out of the valley. Shane is a superb book, as it was a superb motion picture. The prose is starkly simple, the symbols of the story are carefully chosen. There is a monu- mentual quality about the story brought about partially because Bobbie doesn't quite understand the tremendous things that are happening. The book should stand as one of the half a dozen classics among western stories and certainly will build a firm following among junior and senior boys in high school. Possible interests: Rugged independ- ence, the West, men's role. THE SOCIETY OF FOXES. By Patrick O'Connor. New York: Washburn, 1954. Pp. 184. $2.50. Sixteen-year-old Dick Wenting sud- denly finds himself elevated from an inn potboy to a guard on the King's mail coach. Here he becomes involved with the highwaymen known as the Foxes, and suddenly finds himself entrusted with a government mission to France. Here is an adventure story in the best English tradition. There is a pleasant aura of antiquity (the year is 1801). There is the cold and bitter English coun- tryside; strange and wonderful people emerge out of the dank mist; a prisoner is rescued from the bowels of a French prison; there are wild rides through the lowering darkness and fights in deserted cottages on the coast. The whole of the tale has the beautifully rhythmic style of the traditional English Adventure . something our American writers just haven't captured. Possible interests: Adventure pure and simple. GREEKA, EAGLE OF THE HEBRI- DES. By Joseph E. Chipperfield. New York: Longmans, Green, 1954. Pp. 236. $3.00. Greeka is a male eaglet, one of two hatched eggs high in the eyrie on one of the wilder islands of the Hebrides. Greeka grows to maturity, forms some affection for a stag, fights with a wildcat, finds a mate, and starts the whole cycle over again. There is a mysterious beauty about this book and a haunting prose style that will undoubtedly make it a great favorite of librarians and teachers. But let's face that fact that only a highly sensitive and ma-</page><page sequence="4">478 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL ture reader would plow through the acres of description or respond to the plotless account, simply to pick up the atmosphere. There is strong anthropomorphism in the handling of the animals that seems to the reviewer a defect in the story. Possible interests: Poetic writing, at- mosphere. THE MATING INSTINCT. By Lorus J. and Margery J. Milne. Boston: Little, Brown, 1950, 1954. Pp. 254. $4.50. Written by zoologists, The Mating In- stinct is a factual account of the sex habits of the animal world. Chapters deal with such things as the choice of a mate, court- ship, conquest, birth processes, parental care in the whole realm of living things, with only casual mention of man. Here one learns the customs of sea anemones, of insects galore, of fishes, and of mam- mals both like and unlike man. The ma- terial is written with a feeling for lan- guage and a sense of awe for the infinite wonder of the living world. It is a mov- ing book, though perhaps somewhat limited in its possible uses in the school's program. AJAX, GOLDEN DOG OF THE AUSTRALIAN BUSH. By Mary Elwyn Patchett. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1953. Pp. 172. $2.00. Ajax, the half dingo wild dog, is res- cued as a pup by the little girl. She finds him caught in a log during a terrible flood. Algy, the massive chested bulldog, and Ben, the little fox terrier, complete the trio of her constant companions in ad- venture. Matilda the kangaroo, Kiko the monkey, and Kaa the nine foot carpet snake add the different note that makes the story exciting. Each chapter is a com- plete incident. This is the story of the author's child- hood in the Australian bush country. The appeal of the story lies in the differentness of her life, the strangeness of the pets, and the easy style of the telling. It gets off to a slow start but once launched holds one's interest. Possible interests: dogs, Australia, strange pets, adventure. SING IN THE DARK. Maude Morgan Thomas. John C. Winston Company, 1954. Pp. 203. $2.75. Huw Griffith, a young Welsh boy, is forced to work in the coal mine when his father is crippled in a disastrous under- ground explosion. He tries to stifle his desire to sing and compose because his father has forbidden music in his house. After 12 hours of sorting coal from slate in the breaker, the lad has energy for little except sleep. His young Polish friend Joey is almost killed in the breaker and Huw loses his job for fighting the bully who had pushed Joey into the machinery. For months he spends his time in an old shack composing so that his father will not know that he has lost his job. Finally he is rehired but as a door boy deep in the mine. Then it is that he joins the male chorus and enters the competition in the Welsh music festival. He loses the voice contest but goes on to win a scholarship for his song of the mine and in the losing and winning he finds not only his own values but stimulates his father to try and work again and finds his true sweetheart. There is a lovely lilting style to the prose which catches the music of the Welsh tongue. The characters are well delineated and the story is fast paced. Mrs. Thomas has given a stirring picture of the life and rhythm of the Welsh im- migrants to the Pennsylvania coal mines. Possible uses: Coal mining, Welsh music, courage, romance. TUNNELS. By Marie Halun Bloch. New York: Coward-McCann, 1954. Pp. 95. $2.75. Starting with a brief history of tunnels of ancient times and their importance to man, the book takes up the details of modern tunnel construction under many kinds of conditions and through varying kinds of soil and rock.</page><page sequence="5">TEACHING MATERIALS 479 The book is obviously designed for the upper elementary grades, but its photo- graphs and general format plus the factual treatment of the information would make it useful for the junior high or for re- tarded readers in the senior high school. With the great number of tunnel building projects of the present time, this material should serve as a real source of informa- tion in many libraries.</page></plain_text>
