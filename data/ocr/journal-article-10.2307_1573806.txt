Rizzoli, New York, 1976. 236 pp., illus. $14.95. Reviewed by Joseph Adler* The 14 essays in this book all explore from their own particular perspectives the theme of bachelor machines. They present a bewildering journey through 20th-Century iconography and offer little assistance to any'newcomer to the mechano-morphic world of Duchamp and his contemporaries, except for the short biographical details that are included at the back. The book was published in conjunction with a series of exhibitions on the same subject and its copious supply of black and white illustrations give an intriguing insight into what can best be described as modern mythology. One of the book's more outstanding features is the diversity of its illustrations, which enable it to go some way towards fulfilling the editor's objective-'to visualise the myth!' For here the images of Saturn, St. Theresa, Barbarella, Frankenstein and many others are juxtaposed with an amazing collection of machine para- phernalia, thus compounding a fascinating view of 'bachelor machines'. The text, on the other hand, forms a major weakness. It is often tortured by translation or by the absence of any coherent thesis. There are discussions on the 'anthropomorphism of the machine'; on the writer Casares, Picabia, Roussel and on other correlated issues. Some of these are of a dull socio-historical nature, while others are lost in the penumbra of metaphysical confusion. This is not true of Peter Gorsen's interesting examination of the sexual symbolism of the machine, and Marc Le Bot provides relief with a pleasantly lucid discussion on the myth of the machine. Also included is Michel Carrouges's analysis in which he identifies the bachelor machine metaphor and traces it in the works of Poe, Jarry, Kafka, Duchamp and others. Furthermore, we are presented with a reiteration of Arturo Schwartz's alchemical interpretation of 'The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even', where Duchamp's esoteric work is dissected with a distinctly Jungian scapel. The book powerfully represents how ideas displaced from science and technology have permeated culture, in general, and the visual arts, in particular. Unfortunately, science and technology themselves have not been considered more closely in relationship to art. So what could have been a truly revealing discussion on the art-science nexus has turned out to be a nocturnal perambulation. Hyperrealism. Linda Chase. Rizzoli, New York, 1975. 76 pp., illus. Paper, $7.50. Super Realism: A Critical Anthology. Gregory Battcock, ed. Dutton, New York, 1975. 322 pp., illus. Paper, $6.95. Reviewed by Donna Stein** Two new books discuss the recent stylistic phenomena variously known as New Realism, Super Realism, Hyperrealism, New Realities, Photo Realism, etc. Hyperrealism by Linda Chase is an English translation of a book first published in French in 1973. In large format, it is profusely illustrated in black and white and contains numerous good color reproductions. Chase's essay considers how the painter uses a photograph: to make paintings about how the camera sees, to make paintings about how the eye sees and as a technical discipline. She weaves pertinent quotes by the artists into the text and carefully provides a vocabulary by which to analyze and comprehend the New Realist art. In addition to *Dept. of Liberal Studies in Science, The University, Manchester M13 9PL, England. **41 West 72nd St., New York, NY 10023, U.S.A. short biographies of the 23 artists discussed in the text, there is an amusing and cryptic introduction by Salvador Dali. Super Realism b.y Gregory Battcock belongs to his series of critical anthologies and is a compendium of articles divided into four parts-What is Super Realism; Theory and Criticism; The Artists; Gallery of Art Works. Some of the chapters were previously published in art periodicals. Each section of his anthology includes different views in an effort to present a complete picture of the movement. Before each article there is a short synopsis by the editor, detailing the basic approach of the author. Numerous photographs, mainly in black and white, illustrate the volume, providing a visual counterpart from which to understand the style. Both of these books are recommended for their usefulness in understanding the technical, aesthetic and iconographic concerns of this popular style. The World as Non-Objectivity: Unpublished Writings 1922-25. Vol. 3. K. S. Malevich. Trans. by Xenia Glowacki-Prus and Edmund T. Little. Troels Anderson, ed. Borgen, Copenhagen, 1976. 376 pp., illus. Paper. Reviewed by Ilya Bolotowsky: Malevich discusses at length how he views reality and the place that art, religion, science and technology occupy in the world. He relegates objectivity to science and technology and 'non- objectivity' to art and religion. Physical matter he considers to be neutral and unchanging. Science and technology deal with objects and phenomena and with problems of measurements, of objects in motion, of providing food and shelter. These activities he places, rather derisively, under the 'tavern system'. According to him, it is 'non-objectivity' in art and religion that produces the true, meaningful world and makes humans different from animals. On the other hand, animals take care of their needs without the encumbrance of technology. He makes a number of other assertions. Technology deals with work and rest. Rest, however, is not repose. The state of the repose, peace of mind and harmony, is achieved through art and religion. With the passage of time, science and technology suffer from obsolescence, while masterpieces of art do not. There is no such thing as progress in art. Old art in the museums still functions as art. An icon placed in a museum no longer functions as a religious symbol but lives on as art. Each new historical period must, however, develop its own new art form. Malevich inweighs against the barrenness in his time of the Soviet governmental policy of boycotting nontraditional 'avant- garde' art and of forcing Renaissance and 'peredvizhniki' (Russian 19th-century didactic realism) models on Soviet fine art. Such a policy he is convinced stifles cultural development and also has a detrimental effect in the political sphere. This was written in 1925, and I find that events have proved Malevich to be right. Malevich states that 'non-objective' architecture cannot be utilitarian. Undoubtedly, some in the Bauhaus who believed in the marriage of art and industry may have disagreed. A utilitarian building for Malevich is an engineering production. To find the closest to an example of 'non-objective' architecture, one may have to look for a constructivist work rather than a building. Yet, Malevich is opposed to Constructivism. He says it is a 'production art' and, therefore, not truly art, since production, unlike art, is an objective kind of activity. Malevich also disagrees with Mondrian, who wrote that subjectivism is dangerous and must be controlled by the conscious, objective intellect. Like Mondrian, Malevich considers repose and harmony to be the aim of art. But Mondrian rejects empty pictorial space as a mere void. He defines pictorial space with straight lines crossing each other at 90 degrees, which he asserts has equilibrium. Malevich's acceptance of empty pictorial space was prophetic of some developments in painting about 50 years later. In one of the essays Malevich attempts to 'non-objectivize' Lenin as the new savior and Leninism as the new religion. Was he trying to give unto Caesar what is Caesar's so that Caesar would relent and get the government to support the kind of work tP.O.

By this time, the artist himself seemed awakened to his own limitations: 'Aware that we are not getting to the heart of the matter, merely remaining at the level of organising our pictorial means, while touching the level of articulation.' In the final analysis, this often unreadable book provides one with a rare and valuable insight into the complexity, indeed I believe the futility, of attempting the articulation of that which cannot be articulated. Max Ernst: A Retrospective. Exh. cat. Intr. by Diane Waldman. Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1975.271 pp., illus. Paper.Max Ernst o la Dissoluci6 de la Identitat. Pere Gimferrer. Galeria Joan Prats, Barcelona, 1977. 206 pp., illus. Todo Dali en un Rostro. Luis Romero. Editorial Blume, Barcelona, 1975. 357 pp., illus. Reviewed by Norman Narotzky** Though Surrealism's influence waned during the late 1940s and early 1950s, it began to grow again with the automatic techniques of the abstract expressionists in the middle 1950s and more recently in the work of numerous figurative painters. These books about Surrealism's two most important artists are a reflection of the continuing and increasing interest in the movement. Dali achieved fame earlier, but lately Ernst's multifaceted creative genius has been receiving well-deserved and overdue recognition as shown by the large retrospective at the Guggenheim museum of which this first book is the catalog. Over 230 reproductions in black and white and color of drawings, paintings, prints, collages, constructions and sculpture illustrate the fertility of his mind both in imagery and technique, comparable to Picasso's inventiveness. The illustrations begin with early drawings and paintings done in his teens and showing the influence of Van Gogh, German Expressionism, Chagall and others and range through the whole variety of his production through 1974. The excellent introductory essay by the Museum's Curator of Exhibitions, Diane Waldman, who was instrumental in organizing the show, analyzes the development of Ernst's work in terms of his background, the artistic and intellectual ambience of his time, the various stylistic influences he underwent and his own individuality and inventive imagination that enabled him to transform all this into the expression of his own personality. Especially interesting is her discussion of the various uses to which collage was put by cubists and dadaists and of the sources of Ernst's imagery and techniques in this medium. The detailed explication of his methods in collage and his discovery of frottage and grattage is very valuable. In commenting on his proto-surrealist oils of 1921-24 she defends him against criticisms of the brittle-paint quality of their surfaces by claiming that he '. . . purposely sought refuge from the seduction of paint because he was still involved with Dada's anti-art stance'. This argument is not convincing, because, though Ernst may have been '... more than routinely adept at painting techniques... ', these techniques were not academic. To say, as she does, that 'Ernst wanted to avoid a return to the academically skilled but facile paintings with which he grew up' implies that the academic skills were his own whereas in reality they belonged to his father and were never demonstrated by Ernst himself in his painting. The assumption that an artist who manifests excellence and skill in one aspect of painting can do anything he wishes at any time in his development is a fallacy that many critics and historians fall into. A more logical explanation is that Ernst simply did not have the academic skill neccessary to make a more polished rendering such as that in which Dali later excelled. His skills took other directions and, though he was a technical innovator, the author rightly points out that 'Ernst always subordinates the technical and material aspects of his work to the larger meanings of his vision'. A list of illustrated books and documents, a chronology, a Malevich was interested in? Or is this essay a subtle Swiftian satire, a modern version of Dostoyevsky's 'Story of the Great Inquisitor'? The Soviet boycott of 'formalism' in fine art is still in force, but not in the 'decorative' arts. One can find subtle and sophisticated attacks on 'formalism', based on separation of form and content, in recent texts by Marxist critics of fine art in the U.S.A. I find the views of Malevich, a voice from more than 50 years ago, as important and timely today as then. They should help to preserve a balanced critical opinion and be useful and interesting to serious artists. Paul Klee Notebooks, Vol. 2: The Nature of Nature. Jiirg Spiller, ed. Trans. by Heinz Norden. Lund Humphries, London, 1973. 454 pp., illus. ?12.00. Reviewed by Frederick S. Levine* Paul Klee must certainly rank among the most cryptic and elusive artists of the 20th century. His work is permeated with an aura of mystery, a magical quality that stems from the depths of the artist's imagination and that ultimately impels viewers into a confrontation with unconscious processes that are difficult to enunciate in rationalized terms. 'Creative power', he said, 'is ineffable. It remains ultimately mysterious. And every mystery affects us deeply.' This book represents one of the artist's major undertakings, that of exploring and probing the origins of the artistic creative process as analogous to the creative principles that exist in the natural world. For Klee, an artist was the god of pictorial creation, one who could rival the God of Genesis in the process of bringing forth order from chaos, understanding from meaninglessness, sense from nonsense. 'We are ourselves charged with this power', he said, 'down to our subtlest parts. We may not be able to utter its essence, but we can move towards its source, insofar as at all possible.' Such is the point of departure for the present volume, which comprises essentially the notes and illustrations for Klee's General System of Pictorial Media Combined with Nature Study, on which the artist lectured at the Bauhaus during the winter of 1923-24. The text is copiously illustrated with more than 600 examples of the artist's works and there is a most noble (and generally successful) attempt on the part of the editor, Jiirg Spiller, to match the illustrations with relevant portions of the artist's words. Bernard Karpel's bibliography of over 600 entries referring to Klee, his career and work is masterful. Ironically, the one failure of this visually impressive volume lies in the confusing and often indecipherable writings of the artist himself. The limitations inherent in presenting any instructor's lecture notes are enormous, for the notes are often no more than shorthand comments or key terms that eventually will be broadened into meaning in the course of the lectures themselves. Here, the notes are presented as notes and one is left with statements that seem at best baffling, at worst mystifying. (Just one example: 'Another solution to the problem: the structural and individual elements might also be located by a process in which the individual experiences a structural articulation in his own body.... Vitally represented, say, by the weights of univalent to quadrivalent tonalities, with greater contrast at the centre and less disparity elsewhere.') Perhaps most revealing and informative of all this presentation is the underlying indication of Klee's recognition that he could not attain what he had sought at the beginning, for a rational codification of the natural origins of creativity was simply not possible. Towards the end of his search he wrote: 'Please draw no wrong conclusions from the symmetrical arrangement of these schemes-as though one could not manage very well without them. The reverse would be better-such strict symmetry should be avoided, precisely because it is rigid in character. In general, these examples have only specific meaning, serving to clarify insight by way of orderly orientation. They touch upon and open up many elements of the creative armamentarium but that does not mean that they breathe that deeper life that stems only from inner inspiration.' *Dept. of Art History, College of Arts and Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60201, U.S.A. bibliography and exhibitions list and various photographs of the **Corcega 196, Barcelona 11, Spain.
