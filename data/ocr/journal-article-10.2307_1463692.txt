<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion, LII/1 A RESPECTFUL REPLY TO THE ASSERTORICAL THEOLOGIAN STEPHEN CRITES To find myself on the business end of Julian Hartt's cudgel is no new experience. Having been Professor Hartt's student during the fabled fifties, I am put into a nostalgic state of masochistic ecstasy as his blows rain on my cranium, delivered with that unmistakable rhetorical flourish and logical thump. There are few teachers, and few colleagues in the years since, whom I honor so cordially. He will perhaps prefer that I not say he taught me everything I know. But his critique does remind me to whom I am indebted for my model of restraint in making large claims. Actually my claims are not so sweeping as Hartt suggests in ?IV of his article. I will not presume to speak for Stanley Hauerwas, who is more than capable of speaking for himself. Nor will I repeat here the analysis I offered in the article to which Hartt refers. But the article does not treat narrative as the only imaginative form, nor does it imply that all discourse short of pure mathematics is imaginative. Theology, for instance, is not a work of imagination but a hermeneutical discipline, a Wissenschaft charged with the critical interpretation of expressions that do take imaginative form, such as biblical narrative or personal vision. Still, I do not plead to be let off on grounds that I have been grossly misinterpreted. I am basically guilty as charged, your honor; but before you pass the hemlock, let me see what I have to say for myself. I surely agree that a merely expressive act cannot entitle anyone to assert a fact. But Hartt's central distinction between the expressive and the fact-assertive is much less theologically useful than he thinks. On the one hand, the category of "fact," in any strait-laced sense of the term, has a rather minor theological role. On the other hand, imagination is not merely expressive. Its expressive function, indeed, is founded on its more basic role in the formation of experience and the envisioning of possibility. Otherwise there wouldn't be much to express. Experience is our access to what-is, and imagination gives experience its aesthetic coherence. Spelling out these counterassertions and some related theological points will furnish my agenda in the following remarks.</page><page sequence="2">132 Journal of the American Academy of Religion I. IZZATA FACT? Professor Hartt is not to be put off by lyrical effusions and Schwiir- merei. Like a theological Sgt. Friday he confronts rapture with an impassive demand for facts. He does at one point (p.126) seem a little apologetic about draining theological claims of their vital religious juices, but he has driven his distinction between the expressive and the fact- assertive so hard that everything but the latter seems largely decorative. I should think that it might be assertive enough simply to recite the creed, tinctured though it plainly is by narrative form. But Hartt is having none of that either: we must assert not only belief in the gospel, but its truth (?II). Let us ponder this distinction a little. The former, I take it, is a statement about the believer, the latter about a putative fact. But I should have thought that a statement of belief refers both to the subject and to the object of belief. If indeed it can be said to unite the two, that is just what is wanted. It is at least what I should want. For a Christian who recites his creed in good conscience, what is problematic is not whether Jesus Christ was resurrected or whether it was God who raised him, but what the believer means when he asserts those beliefs. Where in the topography of human discourse are such assertions located? But here again Hartt offers us a stark choice: Is the statement true in a merely symbolic sense, as the con- tent of a purely expressive act on the believer's part, or is it a fact? Now my article nowhere appeals to the shifty notion of symbolic truth, and Hartt's alternatives put me in the position of a man who is asked whether he would prefer to be shot or garroted. Aren't there some other options? Something less deadly perhaps? Posing these stark alternatives makes Hartt's own choice seem clearer than it is. Does a statement become factual by being asserted? Perhaps, but only in its grammatical form, which precisely cannot distinguish veracity from verisimilitude, or from wishful thinking. In order to state a fact some material criteria have to be met. Its correctness must be open to any inves- tigator who examines available evidence, i.e., it must be falsifiable. The positivists were not wrong about that. They were wrong in making such facticity the measure of the meaning of referential statements. There is no reason to doubt, in general, that the class of actual events is much larger than the class of verifiable facts. But there is always reason to doubt, in any particular case, whether something has transpired that cannot be empiri- cally verified. Now, the New Testament is not particularly rich in verifiable facts. The residue left by two centuries of historical criticism, in particular, is not impressive at all. More important: even among the facts that an impartial investigator might be able to determine with more ample doc- umentary or physical evidence, one could not in principle find confirma- tion for any of the paramount claims of the New Testament. For the</page><page sequence="3">Crites: A Respectful Reply 133 prime sticking point concerns precisely the assumption of divine agency that, as Hartt rightly asserts, informs the entire New Testament message. Not one to make things easy for himself, Hartt boldly chooses the resur- rection of Jesus as an example. It does seem to be a fact that Jesus was crucified. That this certifiably dead man was resuscitated might at a pinch count as a putative fact, though the prospects of verifying it are not promising. But that God raised him from the dead is not a factual statement at all. It is either much more or much less. It is not possible, in the very nature of the claim, to provide evidence for it. So elusive is divine agency, from any empirical standpoint, that it is always subject to doubt. Whether I assert it, or whether I assert my belief in it, is from a factual point of view a distinction without a difference. It does suit the nature of the claim, on the other hand, that if I am to assert belief in this story I must undertake a moral responsibility for the assertion that is never required merely to acknowledge a fact: a convergence of this story with my own story, at once a hermeneutical and a moral task. Still, the assertion does not make it a fact. Hartt is entitled to the language of fact only if he is willing to submit his claims about divine agency to the normal procedures by which critical historians settle other matters of sober historical fact. Of this he gives no sign. I suspect that like other theologians of assertorical disposition he wants to have it both ways: to assert his claims as facts while denying the applicability of the usual fact-testing procedures. But that seems a textbook case of a cate- gory mistake. II. ROYAL METAPHYSICS Without yielding on this point, however, Hartt hastens to higher ground. The New Testament not only lays out the facts, but discloses meta- physical truth. "If the New Testament Story is true, it is God in Christ who sponsors, in one mode or another, all our transactions with actuality" (p. 126). Now there is an assertion so stout and so comprehensive that it might have been translated from the German. "In one mode or another," perhaps, but surely Professor Hartt would agree with Miss Jones and me, pious Methodists all, that you do have to make distinctions. For here again I find, if not precisely a category mistake, at any rate a confusion in forms of discourse. The gospel is a narrative, and from the language of narrative one cannot legitimately derive universally inclu- sive statements about actuality. However one judges the viability of metaphysics, its appropriate language is abstract, its method dialectical argument. Honest metaphysicians have undertaken through rigorous argument to penetrate the veil of appearance and to descry the true nature of things. The job is not done through evangelical assertion, as though that provided some privileged access. A Christian metaphysics is</page><page sequence="4">134 Journal of the American Academy of Religion in a class with such current absurdities as Christian geology or Christian economics. You either pay the price of admission, in the slow cultivation of a discipline, or you are not entitled to a seat. There have certainly been Christian thinkers, including Professor Hartt, who have amply paid that price, but there is always a significant logical hiatus between their Christianity and their metaphysics. The hiatus creates no problem so long as it is acknowledged, but if the authority of the gospel is invoked in support of a metaphysics (or a geological or economic theory) the resulting confusion infects both the discipline and the meaning of the gospel. The effort, on the other hand, to make the gospel meet an indepen- dent criterion of historicity, facticity, or metaphysical truth is, as Hans Frei has shown (The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, Yale, 1974), what has driven Protestant theology into that cul de sac in which it has been lan- guishing since the Enlightenment. For this move does violence to the form in which the gospel itself expresses its meaning. It seems innocent enough, for instance, to attribute personal agency to God. There is certainly nothing impersonal about the biblical God, if that were the issue. But for Hartt this quality of personal agency appears to express a general truth. Again, the issue concerns language. What Hartt calls the personal agency of the biblical God consists formally in the fact that he appears in the text in a series of stories, or is addressed in psalms and prayers. There are of course other biblical contexts, but to the extent that the narrative or lyric form of the language fades, so does the vivid sense of personal agency. But in the narrative God heads a cast of characters including men and women, angels, demons, and the like. He speaks, hears and answers, acts, he threatens Nineveh and then thinks better of it, and he teases Jonah when his prophet can't stand this change of heart. "Aha!" says the skeptic, "this God is anthropomorphic, or andro- morphic, patriarchal." "Aha!" says Professor Hartt, doughty defender of the faith, "this God is a personal agent." I think both of them are jump- ing to conclusions, confusing the exigencies of narrative locution with the generalized language of metaphysical definition. No doubt the story requires critical interpretation, but a hermeneutical theology will not be quick to dogmatize, either with the story or against it, about what God is everywhere and always. For now we see in a glass darkly, see something like our own faces looking back at us, though further enlightenment will disclose that we are not even seeing our faces all that clearly (I Cor 13:12). But beyond this formal problem there is a more serious difficulty in a metaphysical reduction of the narrative, a difficulty deriving from the actual content of gospel narrative in particular. He is born among cattle, he grows up in a carpenter's shop, he recruits a band of simple working folk and goes about preaching and telling stories in the open air, he runs afoul</page><page sequence="5">Crites: A Respectful Reply 135 of the authorities and is consigned to a miserable death at an early age. Now, this is the messiah, a king Davidic and in some sense divine. As if that claim were not bizarre enough, Paul says he is the image of the invisible God, John that he is the enfleshed logos through whom all things were made. King, Lord, Son of God, this crucified spinner of parables: make a metaphysics of that. The most sardonic critics of Christianity have had a better sense for the ironies of this story than its assertorical theologians have: consider Nietzsche, or Pontius Pilate. The gospel narrative turns everything topsy-turvy. It does not provide us a public ideology with which to do argumentative battle against the leading contenders in the game of world-definition. It ironically inverts any worldly wisdom. Lord-in-his- kingdom? Sure, look at his purple robe and his royal crown. It is the soldiers who pay him mock-homage, like a gang of boys torturing a cornered ani- mal, who ironically fulfill the gospel vision of divine kingship. There may be an "urgent engagement with actuality" here, but it yields no definition of actuality with which to replace some other enjoying public consensus. This story casually adopts the conventional framework of signification in order to invert and negate it. If I were a German theologian I might say that the gospel is a word of judgment against all public ideologies, all meta- physical assertions, all the kingdoms of this world. But let us just say that the gospel is one ironical story, an irony, in particular, against the triumph- alistic temptations of the Christian religion and its assertorical theologians. If there is a joke in this divine comedy, the joke is on them. For when a particular interpretation of our world achieves wide cur- rency, beyond the narrow circle of thinkers who have earned the right to their views, it is always relevant to ask in whose interest such a notion has gained currency. Not only a metaphysics: In whose interest, for instance, are all those literary and theological deconstructionists deconstructing with such ant-like zeal? Popular programs of construction and deconstruction are almost always employed in the service of one or another of this world's principalities and powers. Christian metaphysicians and moralists have contributed generously to this legitimizing program in the great ages of Christendom, and there are theologians politically both left and right who still seem to hanker after those good old days when their fathers in the faith could consider themselves the quasi-official ideologists of great nations, yea, of Western Civilization-and tomorrow the world! III. AN AESTHETIC COHERENCE In considering that the time is mercifully past for this sort of foolish- ness (not to be confused with what Paul called the foolishness of the cross), I do not mean that the gospel offers nothing in the way of a Christian life in the world. To the world-definers and their patrons it presents itself as nothing but ironical inversion, and yet it does have a</page><page sequence="6">136 Journal of the American Academy of Religion content expressed in an imaginative form integral to it. Shorn of trium- phalism and metaphysical pretension, of what Luther called theologia gloriae, Christianity does in fact hang together nicely. It does not need to be inflated into a system comprehending "all transactions with actual- ity," nor does it require diagrammatic elucidation in order to be coher- ent. The gospel story and Jesus' own stories and sayings are mutually illuminating enough to form the basis of a theologia crucis that retains all the earthiness and paradox that Luther invested in that term. The kingdom of God evoked in the parables, for instance, has the same topsy-turvy irony with respect to worldly kingdoms as Jesus' own king- ship has in the passion story, though told with a comic edge that gives the inversion a gentler tone. The comportment appropriate to that king- dom, furthermore, is entirely consonant with the character of that oddest of rulers, and equally at odds with the conditions of other kinds of citi- zenship. The sacramental heart of Christian worship unites the wor- shipper in one life, sacrificed and regained, with Christ crucified. This common life creates what Hauerwas aptly calls "a community of charac- ter," and in this outward-looking community the Christian life takes on a characteristic modesty and good humor, at once realistic about the vio- lence of the human condition and hopeful about the human prospect. I am almost embarrassed to offer such an obvious description of Chris- tianity. It certainly does not render rigorous theological work superfluous, perhaps not even diagrammatic elucidation! But I think my sketch at least suggests the sort of coherence Christianity has, a coherence that I am will- ing to bear the onus of calling aesthetic. It does not prove that the gospel claims about Jesus Christ are historical facts or metaphysical disclosures beyond the wit of heathen philosophy, but the life described does avow these claims in the appropriate way, by being of a piece with them. The same story that unites the life and death of the story-teller with the stories he told also incorporates the common life of those who hear and tell it after him. One could correctly call such a unity of life and belief moral if moral- ity were not conventionally so bound to the application of general princi- ples. Risking another sort of misunderstanding, I think it is more precise to call it aesthetic: a paradoxical story is brought to bear on the imaginative formation of experience. That is the process I tried to describe in the essay to which Professor Hartt responded. Such an aesthetic unity of life and belief, in which women and men have actually lived and for which some of them have died, comprises a logical circle which cannot be segmented into fact-assertive and expressive aspects, truth and symbolism, without doing violence to the imaginative coherence it comprehends. In quoting from my essay (?II), Hartt correctly infers that I do not think the incarnation is confined to the thirty-odd years of "phasic" time from the birth to the death of Jesus. Resurrection does odd things to phasic time. The life of the resurrected is not a mere extension of phasic time, but</page><page sequence="7">Crites: A Respectful Reply 137 a mode of availability to which phasic time is irrelevant. I think it does imply that the logos is made flesh, his flesh, wherever his story "is told, sung, sacramentally celebrated," or modelled in play-dough. He material- izes. If this communication of presence is metaphoric, it is not a mere manner of speaking; it is the integrative movement of one thing into another, a metamorphosis. I agree with Professor Hartt (p. 126) that "the engagement with God is always on the time-frontier," that it is action "running into the future," but it is precisely on that frontier that the metaphoric communication transpires. (Cf. pp. 174-79 of my essay.) It is not clear why "metaphoric imagination . . . cannot, and does not, move the will," unless imagination is understood to be a mere mental act, and metaphor to be a figure of speech. I am told that moving vans in Greece have METAPHOROS printed on their sides. Metaphor transports things from one place to another. Why should this mover of familiar household goods to a strange locale not move the will? Indeed, it may be a better term than "will" for the momentum in which our otherwise dissipated psychic and physical powers are integrated for action on the time- frontier. Take Polycarp or another second-century martyr, who certainly liquidated his holdings and signed on for the duration: If you attributed this startling move to his will-power, the evidence is that he would have protested that he had been moved by Christ himself to be united with him in his crucifixion and resurrection. Now there's a metaphor! And the martyr would have been right. 4. PITY AND PERSONAL AGENCY I want to complete this little Auseinandersetzung by splitting an exegetical hair with Professor Hartt. Unless, he says (?II), "the New Testament faith is ontologically true: what it says about God, and about human existence and its good and its destiny, is the case," then, he con- cludes, quoting Paul, "'we are of all men the most to be pitied."' Actu- ally Paul says that of Christ's resurrection, but that is not the hair I want to split. Let that crux of the story, the crux-surpassed, stand for the whole, as it has earlier in this discussion. So why are we Christians to be pitied if Christ is not raised? Surely not simply because we will be caught believing something that is not the case. Perhaps Professor Hartt can imagine nothing more pitiable than that. I concede that it would be embarrassing. I spent some of the least pitiable years of my life believing in Santa Claus, and still am not entirely grateful to the mocking second-grader who disabused me. Still, I yielded to superior experience of the world, then as now convinced that one should accept unpalatable truths even if the world turns a little grayer. Hartt usefully distinguishes between belief in the Santa-legend and belief in Christ's gospel, but only to insist that in the</page><page sequence="8">138 Journal of the American Academy of Religion latter case we are "of all men most to be pitied" if the story is untrue. Agreed, but not merely in the sense that we shall be found guilty of adding our pennyworth to the great weight of the world's nonsense. Two verses earlier (I Cor 15:17) Paul says, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins." But "sins" here are not merely my ill-doings, nor faith a falsifiable belief-system. If Christ be not raised, he is just a corpse and I am just the personal agent I was and am, apart from him. He lives not, neither at God's right hand, nor in the church (which Paul insists is his risen body [I Cor 12]), nor in Paul him- self ("it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" [Gal 2:20]), nor in any other believer ("if any one is in Christ he is a new creation; the old has passed away" [II Cor 5:17]). The Christ who lives has tran- scended the thirty-odd years of phasic time that ended on a Roman cross, and just to that extent has delivered me from my otherwise total confinement in that frail personal agency that Hartt so highly prizes, with its vulnerable belief-systems. That is why we are so pitiable if Christ does not live: we are still merely ourselves, still in our sins, still cut off from the divine life that created us. Suspending exegesis for the moment, I want to observe that the status of the personal agent, for which "I" employ this tall thin pronoun, raises the issue on which Professor Hartt and I appear to be most fundamentally divided, though Hartt joins this issue so indirectly that it is easy to miss its importance. For Hartt the self-identity of the personal agent, both human and divine, seems unproblematic. His argument proceeds from its assumed metaphysical standing. That is why he is so incredulous at my suggestion (quoted ?I) that imaginative activity precedes, in fact forms, personal iden- tity, instead of merely being an expressive faculty of a personal conscious- ness already formed. Whatever the merits of my explanation, I do want to insist that personal identity is something that needs explaining. Not only is it problematic theoretically: it is in another sense problematic from the point of view of the New Testament. In the latter sense it seems to be pre- cisely what "I" need to be delivered from. That is why I find Hartt's meta- physical commitment to the personal agent in phasic time so at odds with the Christian vision he so eloquently expresses in the closing pages of his reply. Not only is the contemporaneous presence of Christ unintelligible on that basis, but so is the closely related typological interpretation of scrip- ture discussed in my essay. And that, finally, is why Hartt's own account of typology (?III) is so unscriptural. The juxtaposition of Christ and Adam, for instance, in that same Pauline chapter to which we have been referring- "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive" (I Cor 15:22)-cannot remotely be accommodated to Hartt's formulation, that "the first Adam is" (sober pun forgiven) "an adumbration, in some essential aspects, of Jesus Christ." In Paul's typological usage these two figures have far outgrown the status of two individuals in phasic time, of whom the</page><page sequence="9">Crites: A Respectful Reply 139 language of adumbration might be adequate. They have become two living destinies contending on our own time-frontier. Now I do not want to claim canonical status for my theory of imagi- nation, developed, so far as I can tell, independently of my theological commitments. But it did occur to me that a serviceable theory of imagi- nation might offer some guidance in recovering the force of the tradi- tional typological hermeneutic that I suspect is integral to the gospel. I appreciate the attention of my mentor to this venture, and I acknowl- edge that he has, as always, succeeded in raising some acute critical questions about it. But apropos of being pitiable, I suspect that Paul himself voiced what for the New Testament was the most pitiable human predicament when in another famous passage (Rom 7:24) he cried out: Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of... personal agency, from this tall, thin, all-too-phallic pronoun. SOCIETY FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION, INC.
