Communication CHANGES IN THE NATURE OF WORK AND IN THE WORK FORCE PRESENT CHALLENGES TO COMMU- NICATORS. M. Goodman, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, vol 35, no. 1, Mar 92, pp 24-25. As Associate Editor for the "Issues in Corporate and Organizational Communication" department, Goodman in- vites original articles on "communication and quality pro- grams, cultural issues within a corporate or multinational context, communication among technical and business dis- ciplines, legal issues such as product documentation and liability, corporate image, and technical advertising. Communication of technical information to the public, par- ticularly in crisis or emergency situations, is of vital inter- est." - R. Reaves. MAKING COMPANY INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE: HOW TO DEVELOP AN ONLINE INFORMATION SYS- TEM. K. Rabin, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communi- cation, vol 35, no. 1, Mar 92, pp 2-6. New electronic tools are available to give people access to information previously buried in hard-copy or miscella- neous electronic files. Using these tools can shorten re- search time from weeks to days or even hours. In this article, I present a methodology you can use to create such a system to make information about your company accessi- ble to its employees. This procedure can be applied to de- veloping a variety of information systems, such as a company product and services information system, or, as I used it, for developing a company experience information system for proposal writers. - Author's abstract submitted by R.

Introduces the reader to a radically new way of inter- acting with computers by handprinting directly on com- puter screens without using the keyboard, cursor keys, or mouse. Also included is description of the mechanics of pen technology and its future in business and industry. - S. Hazari. Computer Documentation SEMANTICALLY EXTENDED DATA FLOW DIA- GRAMS: A FORMAL SPECIFICATION TOOL. R. France, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, vol 18, no. 4, Apr 92, pp 329-345. The popularity of the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) speci- fication tool in industry seems to stem from its use of intu- itively defined concepts and notation. The use of such concepts and notation gives flexibility to the tool and most often results in intuitively appealing specifications. The flexibility comes at a price - the lack of a formal basis for DFD concepts - and notation prohibits its use as a formal specification tool. On the other hand, a problem commonly stated as a deterrent to the use of formal specifications techniques in industry is the lack of intuitive appeal in the specifications, which has led some researchers to suggest that formal specifications be supplemented with less for- mal, more intuitive documentations of specified functional- ities. In this paper we describe a method for associating a DFD with a formal specification. The intention is to en- hance the use of the DFD as a formal specification tool, thus gaining a tool that can be used to document applica- tion functionality in an understandable manner, and, at the same time, be capable of producing a formal specification that can be used to rigorously investigate semantic proper- 646 Technical Communication, Fourth Quarter 1992</page><page sequence="2">Recent &amp; Relevant • Reaves ties of the application. - Author's abstract submitted by R.

Redesigning a computer user manual to be both com- prehensive and usable can be a question of finding what information to keep and what to cut. To produce a more efficient and portable user manual, a structured, three- stage design analysis was added to the prewriting strategy. To find what information users really needed, a needs as- sessment was used as part of the three-stage procedure. - Author's abstract submitted by L. Beason. WHEN IS DOCUMENTATION FINISHED? S. Pakin and Associates, Journal of Documentation Project Management , Winter 92, pp 5-10. Publications professionals suffer frustration because their work is never done. Managers can help staff have a more productive attitude and can work with staff to estab- lish formal ends to projects. It is important to establish standards that define when a documentation project is offi- cially done. - N. Shires. Editing CREATING WINNING PICTURE STORIES. J. Moore, Communication: Journalism Education Today, vol 25, no. 3, Spring 92, pp 20-22. Strong picture stories require narrowly focused subject shots, good photographs with tight editing, and effective page design dominated by a photo. Good picture stories have depth rather than breadth. They have a beginning, middle, and end. Page design is critical. The dominant photo should be supported by detail shots. - N. Shires. EDITING QUOTATIONS. V. Thatcher, Scholarly Publish- ing, vol 23, no. 2, Jan 92, pp 110-114. Editors must deal with legal and stylistic issues when using quoted excerpts. Legal issues include libel and fair use. Stylistic ones include appropriateness and effective in- corporation into running text. A short survey will help editors resolve style questions: form, length, indirect dis- course, source, alterations, and use of foreign languages. - N. Shires. Ethics DIGITAL IMAGING: A QUESTION OF ETHICS. W. Staples, Industrial Photography, vol 41, no. 4, Apr 92, pp 16-17, 40. Seamless, undetectable, photorealistic retouching is technically within reach of anyone using any number of new digital tools. With a bit of skill, a competent photo- synthesist could cobble together an invented reality with all the persuasion of a real photo. What's the morality (read "ethics") of such manipulation? This question and many others are posed and discussed. What's the respon- sibility of the photo-journalist? - M. Shelton. OVERCOMING THE ETHICAL DILEMMA: COMMUNI- CATION DECISIONS IN THE ETHIC ECOSYSTEM. D. Sturges, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, vol 35, no. 1, Mar 92, pp 44-50. Communication professionals face ethical dilemmas daily, although in many instances the ethical aspects of their decision making are unconscious or deliberately ignored because of the communicator's lack of understand- ing of how to judge the ethical dilemma. For communica- tors, the ethical dilemma ranges from judgment of personal behavior to the ethical appropriateness of design- ing communication programs with one ultimate objective: to change the behavior of a target audience. This paper suggests an Ethical Dilemma Decision Model that practi- tioners can use as a disciplined guide to evaluate decisions influenced by the "Ethic Ecosystem." - Author's abstract submitted by R.

There is often confusion (by both the artist and the buyer of the artwork) about what is considered authorized use of art- work in publications. This advice from an intellectual prop- erty attorney: "Unless rights are explicitly conveyed to a buyer, they belong to the work's creator." Includes a side- bar which shows an original piece of artwork and a new image created from the original by using drawing and im- age-manipulation art software. Who owns this new image? The legal answer is that the original artist holds copyright of the newly produced computer image because it is a "de- rivative work" as defined by the copyright law. The article also includes basic information on how to secure copyright of one's work at the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress. - M. Whittaker. ELECTRONIC PROCESSING: HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. (Feature Article). Photographic Processing, vol 27, no. 5, pp 30-31. Kodak's David P. Biehn addressed Digital '92 in San Francisco, which was sponsored by the National Press Photographers Association. Photographic images still mean quality, he said, but electronic and digital images provide additional freedom and accessibility. Digital images do not require time-consuming manual sorting of large files of hard copies and negatives. They move freely in the imag- ing chain, and are valuable resources for writers. - J. Haines.

Advanced Imaging, vol 7, no. 3, Mar 92, pp 13-14. A famous American artist asked a research team for as- sistance in cataloging a vast collection of artwork. The team developed its own scanner. In most cases, the com- puterized images were more faithful to the original artwork than published photographs. Such a system may replace standard artwork photography. Image processing can re- store faded art or photographs to the original artist's in- tent, and it is not perishable. - J. Haines. ILLUSTRATION SOFTWARE: A VISUAL ESSAY. J. Ash- ford, Step-by-Step Graphics , vol 8, no. 2, Mar /Apr 92, pp 110-121. Products of the best graphic programs are now indis- tinguishable from conventional art. The two basic types of computer illustration are bitmapped (paint or raster) and object-oriented (draw or vector). Paint programs include Pixelpoint Pro2, Studio 8132, and Lumena. Draw programs include MacDraw Prol and Canvas3. Combined programs are also described and illustrated. - N. Shires. PHOTO CD IMAGING. K.

First, bleach out tone on colored paper stock. Avoid expensive frisket cutting with bleaching /copying. Use a gouache lift- out technique to make corrections easy. Manipulate markers with spray fixatives. Paint directly on a blueline template. Finally, create mock oil paintings with gouache and acrylics. - N. Shires. Management ALL-PURPOSE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK. R. Wilkinson, Supervision, vol 53, no. 1, Jan 92, pp 5-7. Writers of employee handbooks need to remember the advertising principle: The impression of the reader is more important than the expression of the writer. Handbooks of- ten say too much with too many words and ignore the dif- ferences in the work and status of employees. A looseleaf format has many advantages and might include a wel- come, contents, map, description of company, pictures of its products, information on customers and competitors, and job information. - N.

Make sure that the internship program is well defined and structured before it begins. The motivations of all par- ticipants in the editorial internship program must coincide to support the internship. The process must include careful planning and personnel selection. The primary motiva- tion should be the education and training of new edi- tors. - M. Jarosz. HOW TO DO MORE BUSINESS IN 1992. J. Graham, High Volume Printing, vol 10, no. 1, Feb 92, p 28.

Is the equipment in your shop producing the highest quality possible for its capabilities? 2. Are you purchasing the best supplies for your money? 3. Have you invested in important automated auxiliary equipment? 4. Are you running all departments, including supervisory areas, as "lean" as possible? 5. Do you have the right employees in middle management positions? 6. Does your plant espouse a philosophy firmly grounded in the future training and retraining of employees? 7. Does your contract cover everything for your customer and your company? 8. Does your plant have the best flow possible? 9. Do you have optimal plant conditions? 10.

Blair, Advanced Imaging, vol 7, no. 4, Apr 92, pp 36, 38. The biggest obstacle to good color management in desktop publishing is when the image matches neither the system's input nor its output the same way each time. A Kodak project manager describes a new Precision Color Management System (CMS), a fully calibrated language for communicating color from the drawing board to final pro- duction. All major desktop device manufacturers must eventually support common-lauguage standards for color management. - J. Haines. PERSONAL PUBLISHING COMES OF AGE: FIVE LOW- COST DTP PACKAGES. L. Simone.

Teaching ADDING A NEW DIMENSION TO THE TEACHING OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS: CULTURAL AWARENESS. M. Subbiah, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication , vol 35, no. 1, Mar 92, pp 14-18.

CONTROL OF FEEDBACK IN COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION. D. R. Pridemore and J. D. Klein. Educa- tional Technology Research and Development , vol 39, no. 1, 1991, pp 27-32. In computer-assisted instruction (CAI), feedback may be "elaborated," which provides the correct answer with an explanation, or "verified," which tells only the Tightness or wrongness of an answer. Students who received elaborated responses performed significantly better on posttests than did those who received only verification responses. Learner control of feedback did not influence performance. Authors conclude that questions from computer-assisted instruction should have elaborated feedback. - P.

Journal of Chemical Education , vol 69, no. 2, Feb 92, pp 141-142. Metaphors put abstract concepts into students' realm of experience. Anthropomorphism, or assigning human quali- ties to nonhuman entities, can be used to create meta- phors. The instructor assigned nonmajors in large organic chemistry classes to treat molecules as people. The assign- ment uses writing to learn, requires creative and indepen- dent thinking, and enlivens teaching. - N. Shires. SURVEYS OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS AND COURSES IN THE UNITED STATES. E. McDowell, The Technical Writing Teacher, vol 18, no. 1, Winter 91, pp 29- 35. This study explores educators' and professional writers' perceptions of the curriculum needs of undergraduate and graduate technical communication students. The results re- veal that although technical writing, editing, document de- sign, and graphics courses are important for undergradu- ate students and graduate students with an undergraduate degree in an unrelated discipline, publication management, document design, testing documents, computer system documentation, instructional materials, and graphic design courses are the most important for graduate students with an undergraduate degree in technical communication. - Author's abstract submitted by J.

In 1945, Vannevar Bush described his concept of the fu- ture of information storage and retrieval for scientists. His vision has been modified significantly as new develop- ments in computer and telecommunications technology add capabilities beyond what he perceived as possible. The pursuit of a modern, multi-purpose workstation which would enable scholars to create powerful, flexible, and per- sonalized databases remains active. Today, a part of that vision has been translated into the concept of the "elec- tronic journal," a somewhat ambiguous, elusive, and ap- pealing goal to many within the publishing and library and information science communities, and among the many other scholars who would use such a tool. This paper pro- vides a history of efforts to develop and institutionalize computer-based systems for scholarly communication, fo- cusing primarily on peer-reviewed scholarly journals. Al- though it would be an exaggeration to claim that these emerging systems are the cause of proliferating inter- and intra-disciplinary research activity within "invisible col- leges," it is noted how such activity is enhanced by these developments. It suggests that the changes now taking place make it possible to broaden the scope of scholarly communication and perhaps reduce the impact of main- stream journals. However, it also suggests that disciplinary structures have an interest in suppressing or channeling the development of such technology to reduce its potential to subvert disciplinary control. - Author's abstract submit- ted by R.
