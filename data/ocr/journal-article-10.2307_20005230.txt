Lecturer in Christian Doctrine, Heythrop College, University of London BISHOP ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGYT 'A book', says Lichtenberg, 'is a mirror. If an ape looks into it, then obviously what looks back out is not an apostle.' It may be hoped that these reflections on looking into Dr Robinson's book on Christology2 will not entirely obscure either the sound points he frequently makes in criticism of traditional Christology, or still less, the good intentions that have led him to write his book. I shall simply be trying to point the way towards how God's human face might possibly be revealed still more clearly in Jesus than it is in Dr Robinson's Christ. Like all books, this book is not a mirror without distortions. It is, of course, written with typical vigour and verve. It contains what for most people, surely, is a characteristically over-stimulating richness of ideas and hints of ideas exuberantly expressed in language that is bound, and is perhaps even meant, to raise questions that go unanswered. Dr Robinson often writes in popular and therefore inaccurate and even slack language. He is much more at home in concrete and illustrative arguments than he is in abstract discussions. Often his views are expressed through the approving quotation of other writers who use very different kinds of language. Some of the important christological topics with which he chooses to deal are admittedly not fully thought through and worked out. So it becomes difficult to know how definitive he intends his views on them to be. If these shortcomings must be mentioned, it is by way of pointing out that such distortions as may be found in these reflections on the book may at least partly arise from the book itself. The book presents an uneven surface which is likely to distort. DR ROBINSON AND THE CHRIST In order to appreciate Dr Robinson's view of Christology, we must start with a consideration of his view of the Christ. Of prime interest and importance is surely his thesis that the Christ is not to be identified with Jesus. 1 Originally a paper read to the Theological Teachers' Discussion Group at King's College,.

Of course, it would never have been so styled had it not been for what Christians have seen in Jesus, and there are usually echoes of this identification to be detected. But it is im portant to insist that the two are not to be equated. The fundamental affirmation of Christianity is that in Jesus is to be seen the clue to the mystery of Christos of what the divine process is about and the meaning of human existence is. For those who call themselves Christians, this piece of history, continuing into present participation, is decisive for interpreting the Christ. Yet the Christ is bigger than Jesus-and certainly than the thirty-year event to which "the Incarnation" tends in popular parlance to get narrowed down. Of course it has always been recognised in Christian theology that there are elements in "the Christ" not included in the historical Jesus-the eternally pre-existent and post-existent Logos, the corporate Christ of his body the church, the Christ who is to come. Yet more than this needs to be said. The early Christian message was that Jesus is the Christ not that the Christ, or the Logos, the meaning of the mystery of life, is exclusively or exhaustively to be found in Jesus, so that the two are simply interchangeable.' (p. I o) In what sense Jesus is really the Christ if the Christ is in fact not to be identified with Jesus is only one of the questions that this remarkable passage raises. What exactly, for instance, did Christians see in Jesus? What exactly made that 'piece of history' decisive at all? These queries will come up later. For the moment we shall stay with Dr Robinson's view of the Christ. We are told that 'we should be more careful in stating the relationship between Jesus and the Christ than Christians in their period of "triumphalism" (that is, when Christian theology had it to itself) have cared or needed to be. Fundamentally the Christian claim is that the Christ subsists in Jesus. For those who would call themselves Christians the truth of the mystery is seen through Jesus, focused in Jesus and is not to be grasped apart from Jesus. He is the clue to the mystery of the Christ in the same way that the Christ is the clue to the mystery of God. Here, for them, is the centre wherever the circumference, the master key whatever other keys fit, the essential clue however complex the final solution.' (p. i I) For all that the Christ subsists in Jesus-and whatever this statement is meant to mean, it sounds as though Jesus and the Christ were identical and for all that Jesus is essential to the grasping of the mystery of the Christ, 'yet Jesus is not exclusively the Christ, as if he personally and individually constituted the entire "Christ-event"' (p. 2 I 3). So much Dr Robinson makes clear very frequently (cf. e.g., pp. 2I5, 225, etc.). The reasons for his taking up this position are never made clear. It seems to have something to do with the ending of what he chooses to call 'triumphalism' in Christian theology. Theologians, apparently, can no longer afford to backJesus only, but in their now limited and reduced circumstances are invited to spread their risks over a wider field of runners. It may be</page><page sequence="3">BISHOP ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGY 75 closer to the truth, however, to see hints of the real reason for Dr Robinson's position in a statement such as this, made in another context altogether: 'One of the most powerful reasons against admitting that Jesus was in every sense a man has been that if he were simply an individual human being, his life and death would merely be significant for what he himself was and did. But if he is to be the Christ, he must point beyond himself. He must . .. be the clue to the nature of both man and God. He must be a representative figure, standing for all mankind and standing for God.' (p. 67) If what is being indicated is that no individual man can have real signi ficance for others, and that only some kind of representative super-figure (which is in fact Dr Robinson's favourite categorisation of the Christ) can carry the meaning of man and God, then the statement is at least very questionable. In any case, it appears to be contradicted later: 'universality is not denied by particularity. The individual may be the antithesis of the general, but it is not of the universal' (p. 72). So presumably the refusal to identify Jesus and the Christ, so fundamental to Dr Robinson's whole theme, must have its roots elsewhere. It may be the case that views of Christ like that of Gordon Kaufmran, quoted with evident approval, have deeply influenced Dr Robinson. Kaufman dissociates, for instance, the resurrection from the finite man Jesus, and speaks of 'the new community which was Christjust as much as previously the historical Jesus had been' (p. I30). So that 'the finite objective historical reality correlative to faith was not in fact the reawakened Jesus of Nazareth but the new community of love andforgiveness, recreated and recognized under the impact of the resurrection appearances' (p. 131). Or perhaps the supra-individual concept of incarnation which Dr Robinson finds in Buddhism is an important influence on him. This concept Dr Robinson links with what he contends was the understanding of pre existence in late Judaism and early Christianity, where it was a matter in which 'a life, power or activity (whether divine or spiritual) which is not as such a person comes to embodiment and expression (whether partial or total) in an individual human being' (pp. I47-8). Frankly, in face of such syncretism, it becomes impossible to determine exactly why Dr Robinson feels he must distinguish the Christ from Jesus. There may be other reasons, as we shall see. But his view of incarnation seems to be of the individualised manifestation of a generalised form of being which (not 'who') is not to be found exclusively in any single in dividual man-in Jesus, for example. Hence he can say that II Cor. 5 : I9, 'God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself', with regard to Jesus,</page><page sequence="4">76 ROBERT BUTTERWORTH 'does not imply that God is exclusively at work in this man or even that there is a difference in kind rather than degree between his action here and elsewhere. Indeed, if it is God who is revealed in action here, he is by definition the one who is "behind" everything that ever happens and in everyone who has ever lived. To claim, however, of someone that he is the Christ is to claim that here we see the clue to God's action and presence everywhere else, because (to use absurdly anthropomorphic language) God "put himself into" this event in a way that was uniquely or specially revealing.' (p. i8i) This passage is particularly puzzling. As it stands, it appears totally to undermine the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. It displays, in effect, a close affinity with the christological shortcomings of the second-century Apologists, for whom the Logos had cropped up in numerous Old Testament theophanies, and indeed in all men of reason, in a way not all that different (and not really different in kind) from its appearance in Jesus. It is interest ing to note that Dr Robinson, in spite, surely, of his intentions, runs into just that difficulty in ascribing any definitive value to the manhood of Jesus that Harnack discerned in the theology of the second century.' On such a basis as this obviously Dr Robinson will not be able to maintain the finality of Jesus. 'The historical Jesus is not even the totus Christus, let alone the totum Christi, the whole of what "the Christ" means. Further, if Jesus Christ is totus deus-if, that is to say, God has wholly and not merely partially vested himself in Christ-he is, again, not totum dei. Jesus Christ does not represent everything of God in the sense that there is no revelation of God outside him. If he is final, it is because ultimately everything is summed up and included in him, not because he is exclusively the expression of God.' (p. 22 I) Whether or not the fact of non-Christian religions either calls for, or is in any way explained by, this quasi-scholastic but metaphysically unaccep table position, I do not care to judge. It appears that Christians may be allowed to claim a purely subjective finality for Jesus, but no objective finality or definitiveness in terms of the revelation of God. But perhaps this does not matter. After all, 'to call Jesus the Christ is to acknowledge that somehow he has that which has made men say, in their thousand different ways, "This is it". What we see in him, how we designate the truly human, depends on what speaks to us, on what for us says "This is the man". And that will differ to some extent with every generation and every individual.' (p. 75) So our view ofJesus does not depend on whether we believe that in him our God speaks to us and definitively reveals himself as in his Christ. But then in any case 1 Cf. e.g., History of Dogma, II, pp. 203, 207 f., 2I8.</page><page sequence="5">BISHOP ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGY 77 'the Christ has been in process-yes, in process-from the start, and in this sense we may speak of "the eternal generation of the Son". His birth in Jesus is indeed a decisive moment-yet it is not sudden or discontinuous, incidental or accidental, any more than that of the first man.' (p. 203) We might think ourselves back with Justin. But the next sentences transport us, via Paul, to Teilhard de Chardin and Jung. But still, as the mists gradually clear and we descend from the heights of the mountain on which Christ is transfigured in such company, we are faced with the unacceptable fact that Dr Robinson's Christ is not 'Jesus alone' (cf. Mark 9: 8). Dr Robinson's Jesus is a man in whom there 'is to be seen the clue to the mystery of Christos' (p. Io). He can be variously described in this and similar categories: 'the clue and the key to all reality' (p. I8); 'both a genuine product of the [human] process . . . and the clue to its total significance' (p. 66). He is 'but the clue, the parable, the sign by whom it is possible to recognise the Christ in others' (p. 239). And this clue-relationship between Jesus and the Christ does not stop there. 'We could say that the Christian sees in Jesus the clue to (though not the exclusive embodiment of) the Christ, who in turn is the clue to (though not the exclusive embodiment of) the nature of God as personal and the meaning of man's destiny as love.' (p. 229) So now the Christ, to which Jesus is but the clue, is itself 'the clue to the profoundest reality of how things are or it is nothing' (p. 23); or 'at one and the same time the clue to the meaning of human history and the meaning of God at work in it' (p. 99). History is thus a process of events 'shot through with, and seen as, the meaning of God. And the clue to this meaning was the mystery of the Christ, the Logos, secretly at work within it, coming out rather than coming in' (p. 195). Whilst it is difficult to be wholly out of sympathy with such forms of expression (perhaps because it is not clear exactly what they mean), it is impossible not to wonder about their implications not only for Jesus but also for Dr Robinson's view of God. At least it seems worth remarking that not only is God (contrary, surely, to Dr Robinson's intentions) getting extremely remote-hidden, as it were, behind a double layer of 'clues'-but, perhaps more seriously, it is hard to see how what is apparently impersonal can be the clue to the universe as personal. This is what Dr Robinson says: Christos is the mystery of theos incarnate, of Immanuel, God with us, the primal mystery as it is earthed, expressed, embodied in the processes of nature and history, reaching its fullest articulation (so far) in the meaning and destiny of man. It is "the Word" of the Johannine prologue-the divine-human clue to the universe as personal.' (p. 6)</page><page sequence="6">78 ROBERT BUTTERWORTH What a personal universe would be like, it is difficult enough to tell. But also how impersonal cosmic processes may provide the clue to what is personal. The personalness of God is of some importance; since Dr Robinson says, 'I call myself a Christian because I am persuaded of the ultimacy of the personal' (p. 230). Yet he can argue against the individuality or person hood of the Word insofar as it 'was thought of in sufficiently individual terms as actually to be able to constitute the individuality of Christ's human personality' (p. I03). He prefers to think of the Word 'as something more like "the self-expressive activity of God"' (p. I04) with Norman Pittenger, because he feels that an impersonal Logos, when incarnate in Jesus, will alone leave intact the full personal manhood of Jesus. He is, of course, maintaining a personalisation of the Logos in Jesus (cf. p. 2I8), taking his stand on Piet Schoonenberg's dubious exegesis of Hippolytus' well-known theory of the Logos' achieving Sonship in Jesus (cf. p. IO9, n. 44). To say the least, it is unlikely that Hippolytus supposed that the Logos of the Father was impersonal, or that he was doing more than construct an 'economic' theory of trinitarian revelation which had no metaphysical implications to do with personalisation. But be that as it may, it remains impossible to see how an impersonal Logos, active in the cosmic processes, is a satisfactory clue to a personal God. And since the Logos is equated with the Christ, how is the person of Jesus, in its turn, the clue to either of these impersonal principles ? DR ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGY It is not difficult to see what Christology is going to be for Dr Robinson. It is emphatically not Jesuology, which is what results 'when Jesus himself becomes the cause and centre of exclusivism' (p. 224). On the contrary 'Christology is logos about the mystery of Christos' (p. 6), a dashing enterprise which leaves Jesus rather behind; for 'the truth with which Christology wrestles is essentially of the absolute made relative-"the mystery", as Paul put it to his converts, of "Christ in you"' (p. 35, quoting Col. I 27). 'Christology has to start with the flesh of God now, with his prosopon in the present tense. For that is the Christ incarnate today. The clue to this is indeed the Christ who has been and the Christ who will be' (p. 241). Christology becomes a way of talking about a Christ who is 'a new corporate reality, at the level of spirit, around us and within-the Christosphere, the Christ-continuum, the divine field or milieu' (p. 237)-call it what you will. Indeed Dr Robinson sees the basic questions which face Christology as these: 'How do we speak of Christ in terms of this world? In other words, how do we interpret the cosmic Christ in terms of a Christic cosmos? How do we relate the</page><page sequence="7">BISHOP ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGY 79 totus Christus to the "huge and totally human hope" of today, to the "never-satisfied exigency of totality" in man which, says Roger Garaudy the Marxist to Christians, is "the flesh of your God"?' (p. 236) Here the Christ which is the subject of Christology seems to be no more than a rather out-of-date name for some supposedly cosmic element or factor to be found throughout the universe but perhaps especially in man, and therefore expressible in the misleading but poetic language of incarnation. Cut loose from its moorings in Jesus, Christology is free to drift and become the name for anybody's ability to say anything salvific, provided it is on a cosmic and ultimate scale. It is a new Gnosticism-an identification which Dr Robinson even appears to anticipate when he says: '. . . with all its threat to the once-and-for-all in space and time, Gnosticism spoke of something universal in man, and indeed was the first factor in lifting "the Christ" out of the narrow confines of Jewish messianism.' (p. 7) But what Gnosticism is said to have begun, Dr Robinson may be thought to have continued, and that in spite of his declaration that 'nothing ... has less attraction for me than the docetic, Gnostic tendency'; and of his wish not 'to sever the link of Christian truth with history' (p. 23I). His attitude to the earthly Jesus must surely make it difficult for him to claim to be all that anti-docetic. And so anti-messianist does he allow himself to become that he can say: 'Messianism is the most incredible and closed world-view of all. Many. . . are not looking for a Christ-figure at all-that is a dead category, an expired hope. The very name "Christ" gets in the way: at its mention men switch off. For he conjures up individual, past, static exclusiveness . . . to men in the mass . . . the Christ normally comes incognito, to those who do not "see" him and cannot "name" him. And in the culture of our day this is the usual form of his appearing an anonymous, elusive, yet strangely recognisable figure.' (p. 238-9; cf. pp. 8-9) But why and how recognisable, precisely ?-if not because the Christ is not as incognito or as nameless as Dr Robinson has been at pains to make out. Christians claim to see him and to know his name as Jesus. They will hardly find it necessary or helpful to work with a universalised or cosmologised Christology which has little need ofJesus, and which finds, in the end, even the idea of 'the Christ' an obstacle. Dr Robinson calls the ancient Gnosticism an 'anthroposophy' (p. 8). Might not his own Christology be justly called a 'Christosophy'? A number of possible reasons for Dr Robinson's attitude to Christology may be adduced. It seems at times, for instance, that he is more sceptical about the possibility of knowing anything about the historical Jesus than, at other times, he seems prepared to admit (cf. pp. 28; 30-2; 102: I23). A more</page><page sequence="8">8o ROBERT BUTTERWORTH serious reason is surely his attitude to the traditional language of Christology. Of course, the language of the Fathers, and especially that of Chalcedon, must present something of a sitting target to those who, because they feel themselves to be in possession of more adequate concepts and categories than 'nature', 'person', 'hypostatic union' and the like, imagine themselves to be in an overall better position to express the revelation of God in Jesus. Dr Robinson is right to draw attention to the language problem; and much of his criticism, often based on a biblical scholarship with which it would be difficult to take issue, is certainly well aimed at concepts such as, for example, pre-existence. But in his desire to speak 'functionally' of Christ, he follows a common tendency to dismiss too facilely both the mythological and onto logical language of earlier periods without bringing to bear on the problem some more consideration of the general problem of theological language, and in particular of how the meaning of that language has much to do with the use to which it is put. Here is not the place to rehearse all that Wittgen stein has had to teach the theologian. But it will not do simply to presume, for instance, that what was meant by the use of ontological terms can equally well be meant by the use of functional categories. What must be very carefully examined is the specifically religious need that led earlier theologians to speak in terms of the ontological identification of Jesus and God (in a word like homoousios): and the question then has to be considered whether a functional description of Christ as, say, the Representative of God can really fulfil that need. Of course, Dr Robinson will not feel the need, since he does not identify Jesus and the Christ, let alone God, in any even remotely ontological way. But has he despaired too readily of the meaningful use of ontological language? Can we in fact do without it if we are to begin to express the truth that Christians, from the start, believed they saw in Jesus ? Dr Robinson observes, with others, that Chalcedonian talk of two natures means not that there are two storeys or layers of being, divine and human, in Jesus, but rather that we need to use two languages, to tell two stories, about Jesus-the God-language interpreting the significance of what is said about Jesus in man-language (cf. pp. II3-I7). And, to quote an axiom of his: 'that of which the interpretation is the interpretation must have sufficient validity in the man-language series if the God-talk is to be credible' (p. I i9).1 But what exactly may be thought to sufficiently validate God-talk about Jesus short of the fact of his being, i.e. ontologically speaking, actually being God? His being less than God would, so it would seem, automatically invalidate the use, and therefore the possible meaningfulness, of God-talk in his regard. Christian belief discerned that in Jesus which not only gave God talk about him validity, but also made it mandatory. What it was that was I Cf. Dr Robinson's contribution to Christ, Faith and History, edd. S. W. Sykes and J. P. Clayton, Cambridge, 1972, esp. p. 42.</page><page sequence="9">BISHOP ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGY 81 (somehow) discerned cannot have been less than what was believed to constitute his personal divinity. Traditional christological statements which, use the concept of divinity may well have an abiding value irreplaceable by other non-ontological ways of speaking. But the most serious reason for Dr Robinson's defective attitude to, Christology lies in an area which is perhaps more difficult to define, and yet one which is clearly central in the formulation of any adequate Christology. It has to do with the question of what it is to be human. Dr Robinson has a number of ways of answering this question. For instance, he describes what he calls 'a sine qua non of personal existence' as a human being in terms of 'the nexus of biological, historical and social relationships with our fellow-. men and with the universe as a whole' (p. 4I). And he goes on, at some length, to spell out how Jesus was caught up in this nexus. Jesus is 'a genuine product of the process, with all the pre-history of man in his genes' (p. 42 and ff.), part of Sir Alister Hardy's 'living stream' (p. 5 I), 'linked through his, biological tissue to the origin of life on this planet and behind that to the whole inorganic process reaching back to the star dust and the hydrogen atom-as much part of "the seamless robe of nature" as any other being' (p. 54). On top of his, Dr Robinson next turns to 'the subject of sexuality as a good, because sensitive, spot of our testing for reality in this matter of the full humanity of Jesus' (p. 56); and he devotes a long section, of not inconsiderable interest, to exploring (necessarily somewhat inconclusively) Jesus' sexuality and even possible illegitimacy. But are not Dr Robinson's criteria for what it is to be truly human really very superficial ones? It may be that we have paid too little attention to the genetic and sexual make-up of Jesus. But this may be because the gospels can hardly be expected to invite us to attend to them. And after all, neither participation in the genetic process nor sexuality are of themselves exclusively human. Some more personal, more interior, criterion is what is really wanted to bring out the full and true humanness ofJesus-to test him, so to speak, for reality in human terms. Is there some aspect of Jesus, neglected by Dr Robinson,, which might furnish some such criterion?-some properly human aspect which might also serve as a basis for a better Christology? As Dr Robinson has rightly guessed, there must surely be found something within the range of what is strictly human ('in the man-language series') that makes it mandatory to speak of Jesus in terms of divinity. Otherwise it becomes, impossible to give any real sense to the truth that underlies the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation. But what might that 'something' be? A FRESH BASIS FOR CHRISTOLOGY? That Dr Robinson never treats of the faith of Jesus is certainly surprising.. It is a basic trait in Jesus' humanity that is commonly neglected by New</page><page sequence="10">82 ROBERT BUTTERWORTH Testament scholars and somewhat despised by their more dogmatic counter parts. A number of reasons for this could be suggested. To such an extent is Jesus viewed in the New Testament writings through the eyes of other people's faith, that his own personal faith can go largely unnoticed. Again, for exegetes and theologians of certain (e.g., Roman) traditions, Jesus' faith has long been a touchy topic. The soteriologically required perfection ofJesus' humanity has been so often seen in terms of a cognitional overload, consisting of every imaginable (and unimaginable) form of human know ledge, both acquired and infused, that in the dogmatic Christ no room has been left for 'faith'.' Of course, it is no easy matter to decide what exactly 'faith' and its cognates actually mean in New Testament usage. Some seem to have gone far astray in interpreting it simply in terms of the 'faith fulness' of God.2 Even for the linguistically well-equipped, this is not the place to propose alternative interpretations in detail. But what can be done is to make the serious suggestion that in view of the obvious fact that the widespread New Testament data relating to 'faith', and particularly phrases such as pistis Christou, still evade convincing interpretation, the way at least lies open for a thorough reconsideration of the data as possibly speaking more of the 'faith' of Jesus than of 'faith' in Jesus. A reconsideration of the data which was open even to the possibility of interpreting the data in this way (and it must be said that such openness is not common among exegetes) would, of course, be making its own contribution to the discovery of the meaning of the New Testament usage of 'faith' etc., since not only might Jesus' own 'faith' turn out to be a human characteristic of such centrality that it could be said to be definitive of being human as such (and therefore revelatory of man's God?); but then 'faith in Jesus' might also be inter pretable in a way that was more meaningful because more directly descriptive of the Christian's participation in Jesus' own 'faith'. Whilst this suggestion does nothing but point the way in a certain direction, it is not wholly or idly speculative. The way towards a fresh interpretation of 'faith' in the New Testament has been already at least essayed by some exegetes. Thus, for instance, Markus Barth,3 E. Fuchs,4 and, of course, G. Ebeling.5 Even Dr Robinson took the matter up briefly in his earlier master-piece on Pauline theology. Commenting, in a footnote, on Gal. 2 : 20: 1 It is significant that it is a first-rate exegete who has taken a saner (but still very tentative) line in this matter among Roman Catholic theologians-see: Raymond E. Brown, jesus, God and Man, London-Dublin, Chapman, I968. 2 E.g., A. G. Hebert and T. F. Torrance, as criticised byJ. Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Language, O.U.P., I961, pp. I6I-205. 3 'The Faith of the Messiah', in the Heythrop Journal io (i 969) pp. 363-70, with substantial biblio graphy. 4 'Jesus and Faith', in Studies of the Historical Jesus (Studies in Biblical Theology, 42), London, SCM Press, I964, pp. 48-64. 5 'Jesus and Faith', in Word and Faith, London, SCM Press, I963, pp. 20I-46; see also 'The Question of the Historical Jesus and the Problem of Christology', ibid., pp. 288-304.

But the possible implications of the 'faith' of Jesus for Christology seem not to have been worked out. For one thing, the notion of 'faith' has not been given the sort of treatment which might serve to bring out its human dimen sions in all their fullness. Until these dimensions are fully examined and clari fied, 'faith' will not be seen in its total humanity, and therefore cannot become christologically useful, let alone central. There are, however, some signs of a more radical appreciation of the humanness of 'faith'; but then these will need bringing to bear on Christology.2 Still: there is a way forward in Christology, via the 'faith' of Jesus, which remains mainly unexplored. That Dr Robinson has not explored some such approach is all the more remarkable in that he shows how capable he is of asking the sort of Christo logical question which would lead in that direction when he says: 'The mystery of the Christ is primarily a matter of recognition-not, Can you believe this individual to be the Son of God?, but, Can you see the truth of your humanity given its definition and vindication in him?' (p. I6). Whilst the two questions may be in fact more closely connected than Dr Robinson seems to suppose, the latter would encourage just that approach which has been employed in concluding: 'In the pages of the gospels themselves there meets us a man of radical integrity, obedience, courage, freedom and sheer victory-undeflected and undefeated by whatever man might do to him.' (p. 77) These qualities must surely come close to what is meant by 'faith': and is not the possession of 'faith' in some such sense-or at any rate the need for it-more radically definitive of humanness than belonging to the cosmic process? Again: it is all the more surprising that Dr Robinson does not deal with the 'faith' of Jesus in view of the fact that he lays such weight on the evidential value of the Letter to the Hebrews, which, he claims, 'reflects knowledge of good oral tradition', and 'is likely to be earlier than any of the gospels-certainly before A.D. 70' (p. 78). Yet no New Testament writing makes more obvious use ofJesus' 'faith'. What needs taking up is the suggestion, by no means alien to the writings of the New Testament when looked at with open eyes, that it is in the 'faith' of Jesus that his disciples, after the vindication of that 'faith' of his in what ever underlies the 'resurrection', saw the point at which it became imperative for them to speak of him in terms of a Christology. His 'faith' in God now struck them as such-in his whole work, suffering, and especially I The Body (Studies in Biblical Theology, 5), London, SCM Press, I957, p. 63, n. I. 2 E.g., R. Panikkar, 'Faith-a Constitutive Dimension of Man', in Journal of Ecumenical Studies 8 (1971) pp. 223-54.</page><page sequence="12">84 ROBERT BUTTERWORTH in his death-that it became necessary to speak of him not as something other, but as somehow more, than common man; as someone in whom the true dimensions of being human as such in this world of suffering, growing and maturing through the accidents of history became so clearly seen-and in an ultimately definitive fashion-that his disciples saw that sharing in his 'faith', having 'faith' in him, was the sole solution to the whole problem of being human, a solution that must have been worked by God himself in Jesus. In Jesus God was living human life in 'person'. In some such way the 'faith' of Jesus could give a fresh start to Christology. There are times when Dr Robinson does not seem far from making such a fresh start: 'The Jesus of history must have been sufficient to have evoked and sustained the response, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God" (Matt. I6: I6). The relative must have been such as to point through to the absolute, so that men could actually conclude that to have seen him was to have seen the Father. And there can be no question but that in Jesus men did sense what can only be described as a breakthrough. The entire evidence of the gospels shouts aloud that here was, in their judgement, a new development . . .' (p. 123) Or again, speaking of Paul's Jesus: '. . . he was a man who by total surrender of his own gain or glory was able to reveal or 'unveil' the glory of God as utterly gracious, self-giving love.' (p. I66) But what seems certain is that Christology needs grounding injesus. It needs to be given a basis in the historical Jesus which grounds and earths the God talk which alone does justice to Jesus' personal transcendance and to his unique and ultimate importance for mankind. The 'faith' ofJesus might serve as such a basis. And it must be the 'faith' of Jesus. Dr Robinson's Christology suff-ers very much from having (so to speak) cut its own throat by too often severing the nerve that links it with Jesus. To do this is to do what Dr Robinson would surely be the last person to do-solvere Christum: to loose the ties which in Jesus have bound the divine and the human irrevocably together, effectively to disincarnate the Christ (cf. p. 236). Some words of Gerhard Ebeling may serve as conclusion: 'The fact that we cannot . . . reconstruct from the sources a biography of Jesus surely must not be confused with the idea that the historical Jesus is completely hidden from us behind the New Testament witness and totally unknown to us. Were that really so, then all we should be left with would in very truth be only a Christological myth. In contradiction, of course, to Christian faith's understand ing of itself, for it is certainly interested in the historicity of Jesus-and indeed not just interested, say, in the mere fact of a man named Jesus, but thoroughly concerned that faith in Jesus should have a basis in Jesus himself . .. If the quest</page><page sequence="13">BISHOP ROBINSON AND CHRISTOLOGY 85 of the historical Jesus were in fact to prove that faith in Jesus has no basis in Jesus himself, then that would be the end of Christology. On the other hand it is not meaningless for Christology, but can be of great critical and positive im portance to it, if we can ascertain anything by historical means regarding the question how far faith in Jesus has a basis in Jesus himself. Would it not be significant if it could be historically shown that Jesus and faith are inseparably joined together, so that whoever has to do with the historical Jesus has to do with him from whom and in view of whom faith comes ?1 1 Word and Faith, p. 205.</page></plain_text>
