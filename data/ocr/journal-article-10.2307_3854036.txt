The following notes, which cover much the same ground as that article, and are in part intended as a criticism of it, were set down by me while editing for publication the inscriptional matter from our Society's excavations at Tell el-'Amarnah, 1922. I. THE ATEN AS THE OVER-KING. It would appear that not enough stress has been generally laid hitherto upon the theo- cratic nature of Atenism, which, although not explicitly formulated in the texts, is strongly emphasized by the names, titles, representations and cult of the Aten. In these no effort has been spared to proclaim him not only the supreme God, but also the supreme King. In the first place, of course, his name is written in two cartouches, corresponding to the two cartouches of the kings3. Further, these cartouches are regularly followed by the words rdy Cnh dt nhh, " given life for ever and ever," which regularly follow royal cartouches in other reigns4, and were perhaps at no other time applied to a god. The usual formula is 1 For translations see the end of the article.

Cited hereafter in this article as " SETHE " merely, with page number. 3 It may be significant that in the stone figured in The City of Akhenaten, P1. XXXIV, 1, 2, the Aten's cartouches differ from those of the King in being formed with a double lin stead of a single one. If, as seems probable, the cartouche (§nw) represents magical-surrounding-protection (9n) by a knotted cord, we may take it that the Aten's names are in such a case considered to be doubly so protected, and that he is thus in this respect even more a king than the King himself. 4 In the later period this phrase does not normally follow the cartouches of Akhenaten, who often con- tents himself with the more modest er m ihewf, "long in his life-time," i.e., " the long-lived,"-an epithet already adopted early in the reign; or rdy Cn4h ( mh (Cw.f.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON THE ATEN AND HIS NAMES 169 rdy cnh ml RC dt nhh, " given life like ReC for ever and ever "; applied to the sun-god, the mi RC is naturally omitted, and even so the epithet ill suits the supreme divinity, who, unlike the King, cannot be " given life " from a higher source. As regards the name itself, SETHE has pointed out (p. 117) that the later form, beginning cnh RC, "ReC lives," follows, superficially at least, the tradition of all kings from the Fifth Dynasty onwards, whose "throne-names" are sentences of which "ReC" is the subject (or perhaps the predicate); it might also be pointed out that, further, the next following constituent of the later form of the name, hkcl hti, "Ruler of the Horizon (or, of the two Horizons?)'," bears the strongest family likeness to hkl Ws't, " Ruler of Thebes," hkl IJwnw, " Ruler of Heliopolis," hkl m?C, "Legitimate Ruler2," h.k ntry, "Godlike Ruler2," figuring in the second cartouches of the kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty including " Amenophis IV " himself. In the name of the Aten the dominion is extended from a mere town to the whole world between sunrise and sunset. (Cf. the title nb snnt nbt Itn, touched on below.) Apart from the cartouches, several of the epithets in the titulary (for so, from its regular occurrence and stable form, it may be called) of the Aten are peculiar to kings rather than to gods. Such are ntr nfr, "the Good God," hrl hr mrlt, "taking pleasure in truth," nb hbw-sd, "Lord of Jubilees3," and nb snnt nbt Itn, "Lord of all that Aten surrounds." This last stock epithet of kings has been quite mechanically transferred to King Aten, without regard to the fact that the word Itn then figures very awkwardly in it: "Aten,...Lord of all that Aten surrounds "! Further evidence as to the royal nature of the Aten is afforded by the datings of records. In the tombs and boundary stelae his titles and names come immediately after the actual date; they are often followed by those of Akhenaten, who thus figures in a subordinate position. In these datings the preposition hr, "under," i.e., "in the reign of," which in all other times connects the statement of regnal-year, month and day with the king's titles, does not here occur, and as far as wording goes the Aten and the King are placed in an identical position with regard to the date, as though associated in a co-regency4. But the matter goes further than this, for records were also dated by the Aten alone. Thus in the tomb of Huya, DAVIES, Rock Tombs of El Amarnas, III, PI. 13, we have: "Regnal-year 12, II Pryt, day 8, may live the Father... Aten, given life for ever and ever. The King...and Queen... appeared upon the great litter," etc. And the datings on some of the boundary stelae are to be similarly understood. Thus on Stela S (DAVIES, V, P1. 26) we have, in four vertical lines in the centre of the upper part, quite apart from the rest of the text: "Regnal-year 6, IV Pryt, day 13, may live the Good God...Aten...who is within Per-Aten in Akhetaten"; the King's and Queen's names and titles begin the horizontal lines. On other stelae, e.g., A, K, Q, R, U, there is not this separation; but Q and R mark off the date with the name and titles of the Aten from what follows to this extent, that they make these fill exactly one line6. 1 See p. 173 below. 2 Cf. SETHE, U rkunden, iv, 601/10, 11. 3 See sect. II below. 4 It is tempting to regard the optative ¢nh which generally introduces the mention of both Aten and King in the datings as being substituted for hr (as suggested by SETHE, 112, note 1), perhaps under the influence of phonetic similarity (cf. hr &gt; g- in g&amp;aq- from hr-ir.f: optative ¢nh &gt; ye : hr written for optative ¢nh in demotic, see SPIEGELBERG, Sagemkreis des Konigs Petubastis, Glossar, No. 58); on the other hand the dating in DAVIES, II, P1. 29 has neither hr nor tnh. 6 Cited hereafter in this article as " DAVIES " only. 6 Stela X perhaps makes them fill exactly two vertical lines.</page><page sequence="3">170 BATTISCOMBE GUNN Records could be dated by the Aten or the King indifferently; this is shown by the fact that the same event that is dated in the tomb of juya to the twelfth year of the Aten alone (see last paragraph) is dated in that of MeryreC II (DAVIES, II, PI. 29) as follows: "Regnal-year 12, II Pryt, day 81: the King of Upper and Lower Egypt... Akhenaten." It is thus certain that the Royal Aten and the King were regarded as having commenced their reigns on the same day. Further features of the Aten's royal nature, presented by the inscriptions, are his celebration of Jubilees, and his title " Father " with the double determinatives of god and king; both of which points are discussed below. Turning from the inscriptional to the plastic material, we find that the radiating solar disk, by which alone the Aten is represented, always wears the royal single uraeus-a note- worthy innovation of the time2. Further than this Akhenaten could hardly go; the severely non-anthropomorphic representation of the god made it impossible to give him the royal crowns, or to seat him upon a throne. Finally, the excavations of 1921-2 brought to light an important element of the Aten- cult pointing in the same direction. The remarkable complex of buildings just north of El-IJawatah was known collectively as "The Maru of the Aten." I have pointed out in The City of Akhenaten, 156 foll., that the " Maru " is a building otherwise known only in connection with kings and solar gods of specifically royal nature; that it is the building from which the king or king-god showed himself at his "Window of Appearing" to his adorers; and that it is probably purely royal in origin, having been subsequently transferred to royal solar gods, to whom it was, however, somewhat inappropriate. II. THE JUBILEES OF THE ATEN. In the inscriptions containing the full names and titles of the Aten, the earlier form of the "didactic" name is regularly accompanied by the epithet -f-, variant - lll; and the later form of the name is regularly accompanied by 1z |, variant 1zI. The only exceptions are a few cases in which lmi hb-sd is abnormally associated with the later form of the name: these occur (a) in the tomb of Meketaten and (b) twice in the tomb of Mahu (DAVIES, IV, Pls. 15, 16); elsewhere in the latter tomb the later name is accompanied by nb hb-sd in the usual fashion. It may be pointed out in passing that the association of 1m4 hb(w)-gd and nb hb(w)-sd with the earlier and later forms of the name respectively often affords a criterion by which inscriptional matter may be dated to the period either before or after the change of name, in cases where the Aten's cartouches are missing or damaged. These two titles have hitherto been taken as referring to Akhenaten's jubilees; but the meaning of them directly conflicts with that view. Im . hb(w)-sd means "he who is in jubilee(s)." The term translated "jubilee" is of course literally "the feast of the sd" (whatever the sd may be), and to say that a god is m hb, "in the feast," means that his feast is being celebrated-compare the names Imn-m-hb, Hr-m-hb, P?-Itn-nm-hb, etc. Thus the title in question can hardly be anything but a reference to the celebration of the royal Aten's jubilee. The later title, nb hb(w)-sd, points in the same direction; for not only does 1 The dating is indistinct, but is certainly identical with that of Huya. 2 The uraeus cult at Akhetaten, and the profusion of uraei as decorative elements there, may be, at least in part, a celebration of the Aten's royalty-as also the apparent toleration of the cult of Wazyt in the Delta (The City of Akhenaten, 163).</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON THE ATEN AND HIS NAMES 171 nb mean " possessor of" and never, to my knowledge, " bestower of," but earthly kings who are known to have celebrated jubilees are also styled nb hbzw-d, " Lord of Jubilees "; thus Tuthmosis III, on the obelisk erected by him at his second jubileel, Amenophis III2, Akhenaten himself3, and Ramesses II4. The view maintained here is still further strengthened by the fact that on a rock-relief at Aswan, certainly later than the sixth year, the Aten is twice given the variant epithet r7 hbw-sd, "Celebrator of Jubilees5"; for Irt hb-gd is the stock expression for a king's celebration of his own jubilee6. What is the significance of the change in the hb-sd titles, synchronous with the change in the "didactic" name ? The Aten seems not to have borne the title imnl hb-sd before the King's first jubilee7, which occurred before the latter part of the sixth year8. The change 1 SETHE, Urkunden, iv, 587/9. 2 SHARPE, Egyptian Inscriptions, I, 24; BRUGSCH, Thesaurus, 1456. 3 On a scarab belonging to Mr Mond, which Prof. Sethe tells me he has seen. 4 Zeitschr. f. ag. Spr., 29, 128 (Berlin 5081). This reference and the second one in note 2 above I owe to Prof. Sethe. 5 MORGAN, Catalogue, I, 40, no. 174. 6 E.g., DAVIES, vI, P1. 21, line 5; SETHE, Urkunden, Iv, 254/1, 263/6, 261/10. 7 On the Oxford Jubilee slab (bibliography, J.E.A., vIII, 199), which was executed before the change in the King's name, the Aten is given the imz hb-sd title in an inscription at the side, which, judging by its very slight and rough cutting, may be a subsequent addition. However, the important Louvre stone (now republished by ASSELBERGS in Zeitschr. f. dg. Spr., 58, P1. I), which seems also to be connlected with the first Jubilee, shows at the broken top edge, behind the Aten's cartouches, clear remains on both sides of 1i_ i| i.e., [Itn rnh wr] imi [hb-sd...]. Among curious features of this stone is the fact that on the left the King's names (later form) are surcharged (see ASSELBERGS, ibid., 37: this is also quite clear from the photo. to anyone who has experience of such overworkings), while on the right they are clearly original, although also of the later form. The two royal figures are nearly identical duplicates, so that there is no question of Amenophis III having originally stood on the left, an idea which is also precluded by. the fact that both figures are alike being handed down "millions of Jubilees" by the Aten. I can only suppose that the sculptor had already begun cutting the stone on the left-hand side, with the earlier, Amenophis name, when the Inews reached him of the King's change of name, and that he accordingly surcharged the later form on what he had done, and then proceeded to cut the right-hand side. That the first cartouche, Nfr-hprw-RcI WC.n-Rt, which need not have been altered, is also overworked on the left, may be due merely to the frequent necessity of cutting down a larger area than that needing modification, with a gentle declivity from the surrounding surface, to avoid a too abrupt scooping-out of the offending portion. If this view is correct, we must assume the King's change of name to have been nearly, if not exactly, synchronous with his first Jubilee, everything depending, for a more precise determination, on whether the Oxford and Louvre stones were begun before, or during, or after the Jubilee. The profiles of both royal figures seem to have been overworked; further, the upper part of the abnormal bounding line on the left has evidently been roughly recut along a depressed surface. The presence of the Queen's name in the later form is difficult to explain (cf. next note) unless it is a later addition. So many overworkings of Akhenaten's monuments are now known that it will repay students to be always on the look-out for such alterations on the official documents of this reign, since they are in all cases historically important. 8 It is mentioned as having already happened (cf. SETHE, 123, note, ad fin.) on Boundary Stela K. Despite repeated examination, in various lightings, of the much weathered date on this stela, I felt unable to decide more than that the regnal year is probably not " 4." As the text of the " Earlier Proclamation " refers (K/20) to n? s'dm.i m (sic: my collation) hIt-sp 4, " that which I heard in the fourth regnal-year," the King must be speaking after the fourth year; and as the month (Iv Pryt) and day (13--sic : my colla- tion) are the same in Stela K as in the date of the sixth year, "Later Proclamation," it is quite possible that the two texts are synchronously dated. This seems to be the view now held; cf. SCHAFER in Sitzungsberichte d. preuss. Akad. d. Wissensch., 1919, 477 foll. The fact that Stela K gives the Queen's name only in the earlier, shorter form (see The City of Akhenaten, 150, note 3) need not militate against</page><page sequence="5">172 BATTISCOMBE GUNN from the earlier to the later cartouche-name of the Aten took place at about the same time as the birth of Nefernefruaten', at latest in the ninth year (see SETHE, 116, note), and not earlier than the middle of the eighth year2. It is thus quite possible for the Aten's name to have been altered, and the new epithet nb hbw-sd given him, on the occasion of the King's second jubilee, which would occur three years after the first; this assumes the King's two jubilees to have taken place in the latter parts of the fifth and eighth years, or in the earlier parts of the sixth and ninth years, respectively3. But for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph it is practically certain that the epithets Imn hb(w)-sd, nb hb(w)-sd refer not merely to the King's jubilees, as assumed by SETHE, 116, note, and by SCHXFER, (op. cit., 479), but to the Royal Aten's own jubilees4. We have e seen above that the Aten was considered as having commenced his reign as King on the same day as Akhenaten; there is thus every probability that his jubilees synchronized with the King's, his thirty- year sed-period being regarded retrospectively as having commenced at the moment when his future prophet and restorer to supreme rule as the Over-King was designated as Crown Prince. It may be more than a mere coincidence that the epithet nb hbw-sd is found associated with the second jubilee of Tuthmosis III. III. REMARKS ON THE " DIDACTIC " NAMES. The following are somewhat technical notes in connection with the cartouches in their earlier and later forms. 1. As has been mentioned above, SETHE points out that in both the earlier and later names the first cartouche begins with the words Cnh RC, which he compares with the traditional "throne-name" of the kings. It is possible that in the UtJI Oi) "ka' of CAnkh-Re" mentioned in the meat-jar graffiti (The City of Akhenaten, P1. LXIV, 75, 77, 79, 80, with p. 167 PETRIE, Tell el Amarna, P1. XXIII, no. 54, with p. 33) the "cAnkh-Rec" may be an abbreviation of the "didactic" name-whether ereely graphic or not is doubtful5. If so, this view; the so-called "Later Proclamation" was not inscribed until two years after the date which heads it (see e next note but one), while the " Earlier Proclamation" may have been inscribed much earlier, there being thus a considerable interval in which the Queen's name may have been changed. It will perhaps be well to speak of " Text A" and " Text B " of the Boundary Stelae rather than of the " Earlier Proclamation " and " Later Proclamation." 1 She was born a little before the death of Meketaten, which explains the exceptional use of bmn hb-sd with the Aten's later name, mentioned above: the tomb was made in the time of transition from one name to the other. The exceptions in the tomb of Mahu are perhaps to be similarly explained, in which case we have an approximate date for this tomb. 2 The addendum to Text B on Boundary Stelae A and B is dated 30/4/8 and uses the earlier form of the Aten's name. Stelae S, N and R mention the renewal of the oath on 8/5/8 in an addendum which was cut at the same time as the rest of the inscription (see DAVIES, v, 22, note 3). 3 Worth citing in this connection is the inscription of Pawah, Aeg. Inschriften aus d. kgl. MAus. zu Berlin, II, 126, in which he says to the Aten: "thou hast caused me to see him (the King) in his first jubilee." Like every text from Tell el-'Amarnah except Text A of the Boundary Stelae, it gives the Queen's name in the later form. It is likely that when Pawah had these words inscribed in the new city the first jubilee was still recent. 4 We find a " feast of the Aten " (hb Itn) of the seventh year, and a " feast of (Ankh-aten " of the tenth year, mlentioned in meat-jar graffiti (PETRIE, Tell el Amarna, Pls. XXIV, 87, XXIII, 46); but that these are connected with the jubilees is anything but certain. 5 (For the abbreviation of names at this time we have "'Wacnerec'" (evidently also phonetic) for "Neferkheprure(-WaCneree," the King's " throne-name"; and " Nefernefruaten-nefre(titi)," probably merely graphic, for the Queen's name (The City of Akhenaten, 166, with note 8).</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON THE ATEN AND HIS NAMES we have here two points of interest. Firstly, the official recognition of the ka' of the Aten would be shown. Secondly, as the earlier name begins Cnh R¢-.Hr-?ht1, "Ra¢-tIarakhte lives'," while the later has for this Cnh RC hki? hti, "ReC lives', Ruler of the Horizon," Cnh-RC would be more likely an abbreviation of the later name than of the earlier; now all the certain datings of these graffiti happen to be of year 9, and this fact would give s a termizinus post quem non for the change of name-which agrees, as far as it goes, with the chronological conclusions arrived at above. But the existence of a "House of CAnkh Aten" ouThe City of Akhenaten, P1. LXIV, 6-13, with p. 166; PETRIE, op it., . XXII, 29, 30) makes it possible that in cAnkh-Rec we have simply a reference to the sun-god by his older name. 2. SETHE considers (p. 108) that the ehts of Hr-)h.t in the earlier name is probably to be taken as a dual form, " Horus of the two Horizons," although he points out that it was still felt as a nisbelh-form ("Horus-of-the-Horizon") in the reign of Tuthmosis III. His chief ground for this view is the occurrence of h'ti in the ihk Ihti, which he translates "the Ruler of the Two Horizons," of the later name. But is it necessary to take p ht1 as a dual in the latter case ? I have pointed out above that hk? ?htz is the counterpart of several epithets, of which hkl is the first component, occurring in the cartouches of Eighteenth Dynasty kings before this time; and although "Ruler of the Two Horizons" would be a quite natural universalizing of the older, local titles " Ruler of Thebes," " Ruler of Heliopolis," it also may well be that in hk? }hti the second element is an adjective, "of-the-Horizon," ("Horizontal Ruler" renders the construction but hardly the sense) as in the hk? m?c, " Legitimate Ruler," hk? ntry, " Godlike Ruler," which are found in the second cartouches of Tuthmosis III. There thus seems to be no occasion to depart from the traditional adjectival interpretation of the word in Hr-?hti; and it must be pointed out that this view is strongly supported by the variant wriing in the first cartouche of the earlier form of the name, on a clay mould at Berlin, cited by SETHE (p. 113) in another connection2. 3. It is worthy of note that in the phrase hz1 m (ht, "who rejoices on the Horizon," the word h41 is regularly written i in the earlier and g in the later form of the "didactic" name. There are very few exceptions to this rule; a test search through the results of our Society's excavations last season, DAVIES' six volumes and PETRIE, Tell el Amarna, in which altogether the first cartouche, sufficiently well preserved to judge by, occurs some 133 times, revealed but eight such3, and it is possible that some of these may be due to oversights of the copyists. This distinction offers a further criterion (cf. p. 170 above) for the approximate dating of damaged or fragmentary inscriptions of Akhenaten's reign. 1 I now prefer (against my translations in The City of Akhenaten) to interpret the 'nh which begins the Aten's names as being in the present indicative, as is done by SETHE, rather than in the optative, because that is the traditional usage in royal throne-names, which contain a statement as to RYe's nature. 2 How far ?ht-itn, "Akhetaten ="_the horizon of Aten," has any direct connection with the titles Hr-Fhtl, hkAl hti, is doubtful. It may be recalled incidentally that the singular ?ht, " the horizon," always means the eastern one, and that the city would hardly have borne this name had it not been on the eastern bank. If the name of the city was decided upon in advance, the choice of a site was thus perhaps limited to the one side of the river. 3 Namely: earlier form without papyrus-roll, DAVIES, VI, Pls. 17, 19, 20 (once in each plate); later form with papyrus-roll, DAVIES, III, P1. 21 (but hatched ! later form written regularly eight times elsewhere in this tomb), iv, P1. 27, right, v, P1. 11, three occurrences with, symmetrically facing three without (Culte d'Atonou, PI. 27, gives papyrus-roll in all six cases). The apparent exception DAVIES vi, P1. 27, line 1, is shown by the photograph, P1. 41 (not to speak of Cilte d'Atonou, P1. 16), to be regular. 173</page><page sequence="7">174 BATTISCOMBE GUNN The writing with the papyrus-roll as the sole determinative of the verb is somewhat abnormal; either this, or considerations of space (| for | , to allow the greater room required above), will have been the reason for the sign's disappearance on the revision of the name1. 4. SETHE considers (p. 114) that the clause "in his name...," contained in the second cartouche, is to be taken as dependent on the words cnh RC etc. which begin the first, i.e., ' ReS...lives...in his name..."; adding that "it is more appropriate as the adverbial com- ponent of a sentence than as the attribute of a mere name." But it seems easiest of all to take the clause as adverbially dependent on the h4C m 'ht which immediately precedes it: "who rejoices on the Horizon in his name...." With the later form of the name this inter- pretation seems much to be preferred (see sect. 9 below), and we may therefore apply it also to the earlier form. 5. The constructioin mt rn f m, "in his name as," in place of the usual m rn .f nl, "in his name of," is strange and therefore noteworthy. The latter phrase occurs, of course, hundreds of times in the religious-magical texts from the earliest times; the former is perhaps found only in these cartouches of the Aten. There must therefore have been some definite reason for the adoption of this particular wording; some nice difference in meaning, obscure to us, may be thereby expressed, or the genitive ni may merely have been felt to be old-fashioned. It seems best to regard the m after rnf as the m of apposition, and to omit it in translation, as done by Mr DAVIES in his volumes. 6. Thus the earlier form of the "didactic" name may be rendered: "Re6 lives, Iarakhte, who rejoices on the Horizon in his name: 'Shu who is Aten."' The chief purpose of this name seems to be to establish the equation Aten = Shu - 1arakhte = Re C, which proclaims the identity of the Aten with the other purely solar gods of Egypt from the beginning of history, and so consolidates and legitimizes his position as the supreme god. Thus Atenism in its first phase, so far from attempting an entire break with the past, laid the strongest stress on the historic continuity of the new development and made a direct bid for the adherence of the older solar cults. 7. In the later form of the name the alterations appear to have been purposely confined to the minimum. Although the first two words " ReC lives " now occupy a place by them- selves at the head of the cartouche, they are still written )0, and not, as by alJ analogy we should expect in a royal name, 0 i. This writing is evidently a conservative retention of the disposition of signs in the earlier form, where the -, made very small, came first in a kind of sportive writing, the Horus-falcon having "life" set before him that he might breathe it (see SETHE, 111-2). In the first cartouche the verbal change is confined to a single word, one may even say a single consonant, Hk2, " ruler" being substituted for Hfr, " Horus." In the second, the words m rn'f m ... m Itn are retained; for Sw nti is substi- tuted a group of signs which SETHE shows (pp. 118-9) must be read AC, " ReC," It, " father," and ly, " he who has come (or, returned)." This severe economy in the changes may have been observed partly with a view to altering the name in already existing inscriptions with 1 The distinction is observed by SETHE in his drawings (pp. 107, 117) of the earlier and later forms of the name, but without comment.-The mention of these drawings seems a convenient occasion to point out that the sign \\ is not found at Tell el-'Amarnah, only I . 2 The ? of hk) had certainly disappeared by this time.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON THE ATEN AND HIS NAMES 175 as little trouble as possible. Such alterations seem, however, to have eventually been very little carried out in the inscriptions; for some examples found by the Society last season, see The City of Akhenaten, 149 (b). 8. SETHE translates (pp. 119, 120) the second cartouche of the later name: "in his name as Father of ReC, who has returned as Aten." But although " Father of ReC" is a justifiable interpretation of the signs 0(D as they stand, it is open to important objections in this context. In the first place the only " Father of Rec " really known to us in Egyptian mythology is, as SETHE points out (p. 120, note 1), the water-god Nun, who cannot be in question here. Secondly, that the sun-god should be called in the same breath " ReC" and "Father of Rec" in this carefully thought-out "didactic" name (i.e., "ReC...who rejoices... in his name: 'Father of R6e "'1) seems an intolerable incongruity, in spite of the fact that ArnenreC is called " the bull (i.e., husband) of his mother" (SETHE, 120-1). SETHE considers (p. 119) that the name " Father of Rec" is substituted for that of Shu because the god Shu in the Heliopolitan Ennead is frequently called " Son of ReC," and because this conception would later become distasteful to the reformers. But is it not doubtfll whether f &gt; , the second member of the Ennead, and ', the solar god, are identical ? In view of these difficulties it seems much more likely that the word it, "Father," is a title, and that the two words should be read Re It, " Re the Father2." No evidence need here be adduced for the pre-Atenist conception of the Sun-god as the Father and Creator of all things, the " Father of the Gods," the ' Father of the Fathers of the Gods," for it is perhaps the most prominent feature of Egyptian solar theology. Further, not only is the Aten himself called " the Father and Mother of all that he has made3," and constantly referred to as the Father of the King, not only is he alluded to as c m, "the Father4," but we have also the title [q D k ,1~ "the Father" preceding his cartouches very frequently in datings, state records and formal titularies of the Aten and the royal couple-not however in the hymns and prayers, thus resembling RC It in being an official or " didactic " appellation rather than a popular one. That the god- and king-signs in this word are both to be taken as deter- minatives, and that we are not to read itff I, " my (the king's) Father," is made certain from its use in datings, and in such cases as DAVIES, II, PI. 5 (east architrave), III, PI. 21, VI, Pls. 14 (architrave), 326. Important in this connection is the passage DAVIES, II, PI. 29, 1 SETHE translates (p. 120 with p. 114), "Rec lives... in his name as Father of Re'...," making m rn.f dependent on ^nh (cf. sect. 4 above), which makes the incongruity still more acute. 2 To read ® 0 r as it Re with the meaning "the Father Re'" is less easy, since the principle of " respectful graphic inversion" appears not to obtain with words in apposition. 3 DAVIES, IV, P1. 32, right. 4 DAVIES, vI, P1. 19, line 6 from left. 6 Variants (probably faulty) of the two last signs are j , t1 . 6 See the discussions of this matter DAVIES, I, 8, II, 15, n. 2, III, 9, v, 31, n. 9. Three different explanations of the group are there given, Davies' first view (that it was to be read "my Father") being twice modified in course of time. The second (that we have here two determinatives indicating the dual divine and royal nature of the god) seems to me to be the correct one, for his third, namely that "my Father " eventually became a standing epithet, used even where the " my " was meaningless, is vitiated by the fact that the group is already used in Text A of the Boundary Stelae, one of the earlier documents of Atenism.

" Father" seems indeed to be the official title par excel- lence of the Aten, corresponding to the ni.s4wt btil of earthly kings; cf. DAVIES, III, P1. 27, top middle. 9. In the later name as in the earlier (cf. sect. 4 above) it seems preferable3 to construe "in his name:..." as dependent on hci m ?ht immediately before, rather than on Cnh Re, since " ReC lives...in his name: 'ReC the Father"' gives a sense inferior to " ReC lives...who rejoices on the Horizon in his name: ' Re the Father."' 10. The sun-god had once been a more concrete sovereign, having ruled in Egypt as "king of gods and men alike4," and since the abdication of his earthly throne, occasioned by his old age and the temporary disaffection of his human subjects, he had never lost his royal character; as Amen-R&amp;C he was " king of the gods," and he could be styled " King of Upper and Lower Egypt, ReC," with the name in a cartouche5. As Horus he was essentially royal. But for a long time his sovereignty had been weakened by the existence of other mighty gods; now, by the agency of his son and prophet, he had attained undisputed supremacy as King of the Universe6. The accession of Akhenaten was thus (retrospectively at least) the occasion of a return to kingship for the sun-god, under the name of Aten; and this is what is referred to by the words "who has returned as Aten" in the later form of the name. 11. The following is my translation of the titles and names given at the head of this article: (a)7 May the Good God live, who takes pleasure in Truth, Lord of all that Aten encompasses, Lord of Heaven, Lord of Earth, Aten, the Living, the Great, who illumines the Two Lands, may the Father (divine and royal) live: "ReC lives, IJarakhte, who rejoices on the Horizon in his name: 'Shu who is Aten,' " who is given life for ever and ever, Aten, the Living, the Great, who is in Jubilee, who dwells in the Temple of Aten in Akhetaten. (b) ReC lives, Ruler of the Horizon, who rejoices on the Horizon in his name: "ReC the Father, who has returned as Aten." 1 Or [hms]t ?
