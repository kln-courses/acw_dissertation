London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., 1931. 12s. 6d. net. PROF. URBAN'S earlier publications, and perhaps especially his work on the nature of ' Value ', will ensure a welcome for this volumeonMoralPhilosophy. It is of the nature of a text-book; and the arrangement, scope and contents have been chosen as the result of many years' experience of teaching in American colleges. The book has, as we are told in the Preface, a twofold purpose: to guide reflection on the ethical aspect of important social problems; and to serve as an introduction to those metaphysical questions which arise for the moral theorist. It is, accordingly, divided into three parts, Moral Theory, Moral Practice, and Moral Philosophy; and the view guiding the arguments and conclusions throughout is that human values are fundamental, laws and institutions being regarded as subserving or embodying those values. Part I.: Morat Theory.-Though, historically, the formulation of moral theories is subsequent to the apprehension of moral facts (moral facts being judgements on conduct, not conduct itself), the author believes that an account of the various theories of morality, rather than an attempt to analyse and describe the moral facts, forms the best introduction to the subject. Beginning with the question, What is Ethics, and why should it be studied ? Prof. Urban answers that the study of ethics derives its value from the fact that it tells us how to act rightly; it tells us what actions are right and what wrong; what good and what bad. That the untutored 'healthy human understanding' does not adequately perform this task is evident from the moral difficulties and confusions often confronting us. The function of ethics is to clear away these confusions by -first making explicit the norms or standards implicit in our moral judgements, and then, by reflection on and criticism of those norms, attempting to for- mulate a standard with universal applicability. Ethics is thus, in the familiar terminology, a ' normative science ' or ' science of norms '. At any given period, Prof. Urban continues, there is general agreement among men that certain classes of actions are right and others wrong- though opinions may widely differ as to whether a particular action falls into a particular class; and these agreed or' conventional standards are the norms, built up by the experience of the race, which form the raw material or factual basis of ethical theory. To explain these facts two widely different types of ethical theory have been formulated: the For- malistic, which regards the ultimate standard as law; and the Teleo- logical, which conceives the standard in terms of end or value. But</page><page sequence="2">102 NEW BOOKS. within the Teleological theory itself we find that the end may be con- ceived as either Pleasure or Self-realisation; and, finally, Self-Realisation theories may be classified as either Naturalistic (giving rise to the Ethics of Evolution), or Spiritual (giving rise to the theory associated with the Idealists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). After some discussion of these various doctrines, Prof. Urban decides in favour of the 'Idealist ' theory, and the remainder of Part I. concerns itself with the exposition and defence of this doctrine. Part II.: Moral Practice.-The goal of practical morals, we are told, is to put the various values of life in their right order; and, for the Self- realisationist, this order is determined by the degree to which the various values contribute to complete self -realisation. The order generally accepted is (1) Bodily, (2) Social, (3) Spiritual (including aesthetic, intellectual and religious) Values (p. 161); and there are three principles operative in the determination of this order: (a) That intrinsic values are higher than instrumental; (b) That the permanent is higher than the transient; (c) That the productive is higher than the unproductive. Passing from these general considerations, and, in the light of them, discussing more concrete questions, Prof. ITrban deals with the relation of ethics to politics, and holds that the foundation of all economic and political organisation must be, in the last resort, ethical Custom and explicit social law, e.g., are concerned to secure at least the minimum of morality' necessary to the existence of society. This point leads naturally to the analysis of the natuLre of rights and duties-notions common to ethics and jurisprudence-and the author's treatment of these matters is fresh and extraordinarily illuminating. 'Rights', he holds, are logically- prior to 'Duties'. This does not imply the theory of Natural Rights. Indeed, that theory is based on a wrong conception of Right. Rights are "the legitimate expectations growing out of the functional relations of the individual to the social whole " (pp. 194-195). Rights are functional, not substantive or inherent. They do, of course, belong to individuals; but they are privileges accruing to individuals as members of society, not qualities inherent in them as human beings. Prof. Urban's criticism of the theory of natural rights and his conception of rights as social products are not new; but his handling is, I think, original. Discussed in relation to present-day practical problems such as the claims of labour and the institu- tipons of family life, the theory, in the hands of one who is, like Prof. Urban, highly sensitive to the claims of common humanity, not only throws light upon practical perplexities, but also itself gains enormously in weight of conviction. Part III.: Moral Philosophy, deals with the metaphysical issues raised by ethical theory. The postulates of morality are considered in relation to the postulates of science; and there is an interesting chapter on the Problem of Moral Knowledge. Both the Intuitionist theory and the Em- pirical theorv of conscience are rejected on account of their extreme one- sidedness. As against Intuitionism it is contended that conscience has, from one point of view, an historical development; and, as against Empiricism, it is held that there is yet an a priori element in morality-a view which Prof. Urban regards as supported by the present-day tendency to restore the a priori factor in the conception of knowledge in general. The notions of ' good ' and ' bad ' are undefinable in terms of anything else. They are ' logically primitive concepts-'. The sense of duty is unique and unanalysable. The principle that ' The greater value ought to be chosen over the less' is an immediatelv self-evident moral law.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 103 The last three chapters are concerned with the freedom of the will, the concept of moral progress, and the relation of morality to religion. From this summary statement it will be obvious that,Prof. Urban's introduction to moral philosophy is a comprehensive one. Part T. covers familiar ground, reproducing the strong and (I believe) the weak points of Idealism. Perhaps it is because one is traversing familiar ground that one feels there is lacking that hard, concentrated thinking characteristic of the earlier Idealists such as Green. And with regard to Part III., while there is much that is profound, an impression is occasionally left that far-reaching conclusions are rested upon arguments which will scarcely bear their weight. But these criticisms are perhaps misdirected. Prof. Urban is not, after all, writing to convert hardened heretics, but rather to direct younger minds to what he conceives to be the most fruitful lines of advance in moral philosophy; and that aim necessarily determines the extent to which the author can be expected to discuss what appear to him ultimately untenable theories. Limitations imposed by the purpose of the text are, as far as possible, rectified by a catholic selection of books for further reading at the end of each chapter. Reference may be made to three points of detail. (1) I feel some doubt as to Prof. Urban's conception of the nature and function of ethics. Does he distiriguish between a 'normative science' and a 'science of norms ' ? Ethics, conceived as a science of norms, would not necessarily be concerned to tell us how to act rightly; whereas, conceived as a normative science, I suppose it would. Prof. Urban does take it to be the business of ethics " to tell us how to act rightly " (p. 3); but there is, I should have thought, a real difference between a moral code or system of precepts and a moral theory. The author indeed appears to agree with this view when he says (p. 35) that " it is not the business of ethics to make a new morality, but rather to understand and interpret the morality we have ". Because of these two apparently different conceptions of the function of ethics, the argument of Chapter I. did not seem to me quite clear. But the two statements are quite compatible if Prof. Urban is contending that ethics, like other sciences, has a ' pure ' and an ' applied ' part, to neither of which the title of 'science' can be refused. (2) Prof. Urban asserts that the obligation to choose the good is axio- matic, and that the proposition " the greater value ought to be chosen over the less " is an immediately self-evident moral law. Many moralists would flatly deny both these assertions. They would certainly agree that, once I understand what 'good' means, it becomes evident that I always do aim at it, and that I always do aim at a greater over a lesser value; but the very meaning of good implies that to speak of any obligation in this respect is irrelevant and insignificant. Axioms and self-evident moral laws, like the philosopher's stone, have been sought in all ages; and several moralists have recently mined the earth or swept the heavens prosecuting that quest. Is not the search a vain one, and is it not inspired by an epistemology based on a misinterpretation of the place of axioms in mathematical thinking ? That at any rate was the earlier view in the tradition which Prof. Urban represents. But this is an iconoclastic age, and it seems we can no longer cling to the faith that Oxford is Oxford and Cambridge is Cambridge, and never the twain shall meet. (3) When considering the validity of the Naturalistic theory of conscience, Prof. Urban, unless I misunderstand him, holds that it explains primitive but not civilised morality, for " the two are quite different ". With regard</page><page sequence="4">104 NEW BOOKS. to the tribesman's conscience " it is quite proper to sav that on this level there is no individual moral self" (p. 373). It would be interesting to know whether the author was simply granting, for the sake of argument, a distinction between primitive and civilised morality, and maintaining that, even so, the Ethics of Evolution cannot explain our moral con- sciousness; or whether this view of primitive man represents his con- sidered conviction. Prof. -Urban is not unaware of Prof. F. C. Sharp's analysis of certain typical phenomena of primitive society (Ethics, Chapter XI.), and his prettv convincing conclusion that "the human conscience may properly be regarded as in the last analysis everywhere the same " ; or of a similar contention in Green's " Prolegomena " (e.g., pars. 190 and 201-205). The point is of such importance for general moral theory that one would have appreciated a slightly more explicit statement of Prof. Urban's own attitude. But, these more or less critical remarks aside, one cannot but feel under a great obligation to Prof. Urban for his most interesting and valuable analysis of moral practice in Part II. A great moralist in every sense, he has not only given his students insight into historical and systematic ethics, but has also brought a well-thought-out moral theory to set in perspective serious and delicate social problems which not everyone could handle in so dispassionate and yet illuminating a fashion. They are very fortunate Wvhose adventures in philosophy have been led by him. W. D. LAMONT. Opera hactenus inedita Rogeri Baconi. Fasc. XI.

THE questions on Met. A-r now published for the first time appear to be the latest work of Bacon on any part of the Metaphysics, and it is interesting to note that when he wrote them he, was aware that the whole contains thirteen books (of the existence of K he would seem not to have been informed). The editors do not explicitly say from what manuscript the questions are edited, but I infer from expressions in their Introduction that they are part of the contents of the Amiens MS. from which the materials of the last two fascicules have been derived. The silence of 'the editors presumably means that the same thing is true of the questions on the spurious de Plantis. I hasten to say that, so far as I can judge, the editing of these questions has been much better done than in some former volumes of the series. There is nowhere any stark unintelligibility, and if the -text is read with the corrections placed at the end of the volume, Bacon's sense is in the main faithfully presented. On the whole I con- gratulate the editors on their dealing with what is evidently a very in- correctly written MS. This is not to say that I do not think further corrections sometimes necessary, and I propose to add a few conjecturally in the hope that they may be found helpful. P. 3, 21, ut sciant id de quo ineantur- seems quite unmeaning; the context requires something like de quo in ea (tract)atur. P. 14, 13, meliori</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 105 modo quo eidem potest.? Quidem. P. 21, 25, the MS. ut quod moveat habeatur seems to me, by comparison with what follows, right against the editors' suggested moveatur. P. 32, 33, also, the MS. et hoc modo seems to me right against the proposed est hoc modo, which I can hardly translate. P. 67, 11, the MS. et potentie materie resolubilis is certainly unmeaning, but surely what is wanted for potentie is in potentiam (not potentia as proposed in the corrections). P. 75, 24, for - in rectitudinem non potest predicari must we not read in rectitudine ? P. 76, 24, distinguimus 10 homines etc. Qy. 10 homines a C. P. 77, 31, accidens vel passiones rerum. Qy. passio. P. 101, 31, res entis, 1. res entes. P. 107, 32 and elsewhere a familiar maxim is given in the untranslatable form propter unumquodque est tale, et illud magis. Must we not, in every case, insert a quod after the propter ? P. 108, 5, the sense requires the deletion of non. P. 116, 1, nec curet unde respondenti videatur vel non. 1. utrum for unde (a scribal error noted in another case by the editors). P. 139, 34, for hoc 1. hic (adverb). P. 149, 4, leads me to retract a criticism passed on a former volume of the edition, with apologies to the editors. I know now what is meant-or think I know-by the recurring phrase continuatio esse divini. It means the impartation of a remoter and remoter analogue of the 'being' which, in its fullness, belongs only to God, to the descending chain of the creatures. Hence I was probably in error in taking the phrase in a former instalment to be a transcriptional slip for continuatio essendi. It is not likely that the words are corrupt in all the half-dozen places where they occur in these questiones, and I therefore desire the editors to accept my retractation of my former strictures on this particular expression. P. 159, 13, mutationem makes such feeble sense that I rather confidently suggest imitationem. P. 160, 1, for solum vel I think we should clearly read vel solum. I could add a few more proposals, but these, I think, are the chief ones I have to make. I trust it will be understood that they are not made in any spirit of detraction, but simply from the desire to help forward the work of extracting a correct text of the author from the reports of hasty, careless, or ignorant scribes. I hope I shall not be thought unconscientious when I go on to state that I have not examined the text of the questions on the de Plantis. My acquaintance with even the version of that work from the Latin which figures in the Aristotelian corpus is slight and my knowledge of the problems raised by the text slighter, and it does not appear to me that any remarks of mine upon this part of the composite volume would be of the least value to any one. The version of part of the Metaphysics is apparently the most ancient at present known, the actual manuscripts from which it is taken (one at Avranches, the other at Oxford) being either older than, or little later than, the end of the twelfth century. The translation aims at being a verv 6lose word-for-word rendering, and I should imagine its publication should be of some value to minute students of the Greek textual tradition. (How far the editors have done rightly, in cases where actual Greek words are intro- duced into the text, in relegating the nonsense into which they have been depraved by the scribes of the MSS. to the foot of the page, and printing the true forms in the text, I do not feel competent to judge.) Perhaps I niay be allowed to offer a few suggestions for improvement to the editors on this part of their work also. P. 257, 5, it is not the second, but the first quod which requires to be omitted; ib. 1. 18, the suggestion to correct speculative to speculativi is certainly wrong; the word represents the Greek at ECOp?p-lKai correctly. P. 258, 8, the proposed correction of</page><page sequence="6">106 NEW BOOKS. 8ervilitibus to sensibus is required to bring the version into line with the Greek ala-0iro-feot. But can we be sure that the translator had not aito-Or-ov before him ? I think I should have preferred to leave the alteration dubious. The translator was, in any case, not perfect in his Greek. At 257, 30 he has a mysterious clause cum virtus sit due to misreading the atperT?v ovioav of his original as apETqbv oi5o-av, and immediately below he makes something like nonsense by rendering 'pXtKcrFPav antiquiorem (Met. 987a, 16). The /yEpav of 982b, 30, he oddly renders senium (by a confusion with 1yrpas), and these are only a few examples of the way in which he has distorted the meaning of his author. As the editors say, Bacon's apparently splenetic attacks on the tianslators of Aristotle be- come much more intelligible when we realise the sort of version from which he had to extract the Greek philosopher's meaning. I am not sure whether the editing of this part of the volume has always been done with the requisite caution. Some MS. readings which have been rejected will, I think, be seen to be sound, since, though they give a wrong sense, they correspond to the text of the manuscript of the Metaphysics known as E, and presumably represeit what the translator had before him. Thus at 259, 35 si aliquid [non] minimorum non men- suratur the non, though certainly wrong, corresponds to the OVtK of E, and the editors should therefore at least have thought twice before bracket- ing it. On the other hand, at 263, 13 amorem [et] desideriumne in his que sunt posuerit principium, the ne is senseless, and since the Greek is 'pcora 7) lEntOvpIav, we clearly should omit et and read desideriumve. The singular error at 258, 1, ob hoc, where the sense demands ab hoc, is presumably a printer's oversight. 264, 10 raises a pretty problem. The Latin runs Anaxagorasque enim mecho utiler intellectu. The editors, mindful of the ,uLqxavD of the Greek; not unnaturally prop6se to emend to mechanico. But since the Avranches MS. has a gloss, id est adultero, I take it the maker of the translation had before him a corrupt text in which Motxci was written for 1.LqXavf. In such cases, I take it, it is im- portant not to emend back to conformity with what we know to be the genuine Greek text. If we do so, we destroy the evidence as to the condition of the Aristotelian text known to twelfth-century translators. An odd example of the difficulties the student of Bacon's time had to wrestle with is given by.265, 34, where a guess has been made at the meaning of Aristotle's word O-vvEtpoFuLvi7v, with the result that it is turned into the absolutely meaningless Latin cumdictum (conglutinabant cumdictum omne ipsis esse negotium = -7rpoo-eyXtXovTo roi -vvEtpopeOvi7v 7raioav avirois etvat r)v 7rpay,IaTEtav). In a similar fashion the familiar statement about Socrates, - 7rEp't 6optou.Lov erito-rqo-avrov 7rpcoov nr)v &amp;aavotav appears as de diffinitionibus sciente primo intellegentiam. One really wonders at the penetration with which a man like Bacon could somehow get at the main sense of the author under such disguises. It would hardly be in place in MIND to go through such a version at length suggesting improvements on the text provided by the editors. Much more, in my opinion, needs to be done in the way of lesser improve- ments on their work before we can feel confident that we have the vetus as Bacon read it than is needed for the questiones, but I prefer to thank them for what they have done rather than to make ungracious complaints about what is left to do. I suspect, however, that this part of the work suffers throughout from neglect to take account of the variations of the Greek MSS., and to determine the precise affiliation of that from which the version was made, as also from a tendency to discount actual scribal</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. '107 errors in these particular MSS., or what amounts to much the same thing, misreadings of the MSS. by the translator. The editors, I think, are a little too ready to correct unduly w'ith a view to bringing the version into line with the Greek textus receptus. Still there are some puzzles'which should hardly have been set to the reader. What is meant, e.g., at 273, 30, by the word hee (Gk. oV'rol) ? At 274, 19 there is a typical puzzle for the editors. Messrs. Steele and Delorme print in their text the meaningless unde dicunt (Gk. ov'Uv Xeyovolv), giving nihil as an 'emetidation' at the end of the volume. But did the translator, I wonder, find ovIev in his ,original, and misread it as 0o'ev ? If not, how is a 'corruption' of nihil to unde to be explained ? A second puzzle occurs on the same page just below, at 1. 32, where 7rapa TrOV d'pt0po TOVTOV is represented by imparem numerum hunc.1 I could certainly wish the MSS. to be inspected again at this place, since it is so clear that what they ought to read is praeter. The hee of 276, 13 must surely be a mistake for hec (Gk. Ta,T7a, misread as TavTa). Also 278, 27, strictum is pretty obviously the scribe's accidental ,error for solidum (Gk. TO mrTEpedv) and multum at 29 a similar oversight for latum (TO5 7rXaTrV). Immediately below (33) the full stop after generi completely destroys the sense. Read Huic quidem igitur generi et oppugn(ab)at Plato (CGk. TOVT&amp;L, /EV OVlV T7( 7EVEL Kat &amp;EuaXETO aX7TWV). It would be possible to pursue 'the subject further to the point where the MS. of the translation breaks off at C 1007a, 31, but I doubt if the readers of MIND would have patience with me. As I have alreadv said, while grateful to the editors for this curious specimen of the sort of text Bacon had to work on, I feel that in some cases they have failed to exhibit all its peculiarities from a natural tendency to 'correct' it into agreement with the Greek 'vulgate'. But humanum est errare. A. E. TAYLOR. Philosophical Aspects of Modern Science, By C. E. M. JOAD. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1932. Pp. 344. 10s. 6d. MR. JOAD is almost the first to draw up the philosophical indictment of the speculations that the new physics has given rise to. He selects for exam- ination Eddington, Jeans and Russell. The last, treated with equal length but with less concentration, is dismissed on the grounds that his subjec- tivism rests on a surreptitious basis of realism, that his mathematicism ignores qualities, and that his neutral monism leaves no room for mind in its indefeasible quality of awareness. The author's interest is obviously fixed on the former two, as representing the van of the current movement from science to philosophy. Both have declared that the new physics leads to an idealistic metaphysics, and thereby encounter Mr. Joad's repudiation of all idealism, based on the charge, which to most of us will seem paradoxical, that it imperils the objectivity of values. Jeans' complete philosophical naivete makes him an easy prey. Unlike Eddington's, his speculation springs from the results rather than from the methodic principles of physics. He notes that the phvsicist's world has become a mathematical world in ingredients as well as in organisation, and reaches the idealist conclusion by first alleging the absence of materiality Can the translator have read 7rapa TOV as VepLtrrov ? In that case imparem should be kept. A. E. T.</page><page sequence="8">108 NEW BOOKS. in mathematical objects, and then by identifying these with thoughts, Thoughts, of course, presuppose a thinker. Mr. Joad's exposure of the slenderness of this argument would, I am sure, have added to its usefulness if he had turned his criticism also upon the superficial notion of materiality that is making the jump to idealism too easy. Surely the disappearance of bulk and figure do not constitute the atom into a spirit. When matter is defined as it should be, by the kind of law it exemplifies, it is seen to be still as far from mind as it was in the dualism of Descartes. Matter is so much of experienced fact as obeys mathematical laws. The mind's relation to these laws is altogether different, the relation not of obedience but of excogitation and recognition. Two kinds of entity may be identified when the laws of their behaviour are the same, not when the laws one embodies. are the laws the other thinks. Eddington is more formidable. His final constructive statement is precipitate, as he himself admits, but there is an arduous preparation for it, and the preparation is eminently philosophical in its technique. He mounts to speculation not on the basis of the achieved content of the new- physics but through an epistemological evaluation of its new methods and principles. The reduction of the objects of physics to pointer-readings is not for him, as it seems to be for Jeans, a mark of the finality of physics,. but the very opposite. The readings are too abstract to be real and too much the free work of the mind to be true. It is here that Mr. Joad inter- venes to uncover a serious ambiguity in Eddington's statement. The^ ambiguity may be expressed in various ways: one way is that pointer- readings are said sometimes to be the starting-point of scientific construc- tion and sometimes the result; another way, that they are adduced now as all that the physicist qua physicist knows and now as the cause of his knowledge; yet another way, that here they are affirmed to be the realities. screened by sense and common sense while elsewhere they are stripped of any pretensions to reality at all. The relations among the sensa, pointer- readings, mathematical constructions from the latter, the scientist's mind, and the cosmic mind-stuff suggested as the ultimately real are left vague. As Mr. Joad rightlv puts it, Eddington's weakness lies in his failure to deal with the epistemological problem of perception. It is by adding to, this weakness obedience to the anthropomorphic impulse that Mr. Joad accounts for-both Eddington's and Jeans's easy slide into idealism. Mr. Joad now proceeds to a summary statement of his own theory of perception, which, as is well known, he has presented more fully elsewhere. The theory is realism in its extreme form: every object of a cognitive act is independent of the act (which, of course, to yield realism, requires also, the reduction of mind to acts and of acts to awareness; but these dis- putable complications are not discussed). The other possible relations. between act and object are stated, examined, and rejected on the ground that they present more serious difficulties than the above one does. The rejected theories are rejected chiefly because they can give no successful account of the relation between the objects of sense and those of common sense or of physics. But when Mr. Joad himself comes to this problem he can only offer a very slight account indeed: the sensory object " suggests," bears our awareness to, common-sense objects, and these in turn suggest to minds of a higher stage of mental development the objects of physics. Even as a merely descriptive psychological statement this would be slight,. but the real defect of it is that it is only psychological, and therefore does not touch the question of validity. It is curious to be left with no relation except a psychological one among all the several kinds of object asserted</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 109 to be independent of all psychical mechanism. This result, and the vaporisation of mind into mere awareness that is largely responsible for this result, plainly invite criticism. This deliberately indiscriminate realism, it transpires, has been adopted by Mr. Joad as the only means of ensuring the objectivity of values. Being objects of awareness they, too, are independent of it. Values constitute another realm, " suggested " by the rest. Here I find the exposition puzzling, for Mr. Joad repeatedly insists that the apprehension of values is possible only to a mind that stands supernormally high in the evolutionary scale, and that even now such apprehension is relatively rare. Value must here miean something like a Platonic Form, a value that is nothing but a value, not a something that is valuable; and admittedly the pure intuition of value is highly abstract and therefore hard to come by. But my difficulty lies not so much in conceiving value in the abstract as in conceiving it to be real in this abstractness. I can think it to be independent of mind, but not to be independent of anything. It appears to be essentially, not accidentally, adjectival. The doctrine that value is not, a property of objects but is simply suggested by them, and yet is equally real or existent, only perplexes me, for such value has for me no value- content and therefore no content at all. Logically pressed, the theory involves the odd conclusion that neither subject nor object has value; the subject meets it only by contemplation, objects only by suggestion. This is the nemesis of taking objectivity in its -most obvious and purely descriptive sense, as overagainstness to a subject, as ultimate. The reason of it all is Mr. Joad's supposition that any attenuation of the dis- tinction of subject and object would engulf the latter in the former and reduce value along with object to something that appears in the objective field only because it has already been projected there by the apprehending spirit, the objection to which is that the moral and aesthetic life (of the religious life Mr. Joad is not so sure) requires us to postulate the indepen- dence on the part of value of the judgment that asserts value, and if we grant the independence here we must in consistency grant it of the object of every judgment whatever. Personally, I prefer to think that the concern for the reality of values is not for their reality simpliciter, but for their reality as integrated properties of other objects and of the subject itself; and that the epistemological analysis and interpretation of judg- ments of fact are best achieved directly, not indirectly as a deduction from the supposed requirements of judgments of value. I would prefer, too, a theory that would find for the term " reality " a meaning other than that of factual apprehendedness. It is, of course, easier to criticise a book than to write one, and I cannot close without paying a genuinely respectful tribute to the writing of this one. It is acute without being trivial, and lucid almost to a fault, though its hundred felicities of expression are never decorative but alwavs signi- ficant. The sections dealing with the theory of perception seem to me to be weak, because instead of solving the major problems of perception they virtually posit them as insoluble; but the rest of the book is altogether admirable. The early chapters form the best elementary introduction I know to the epistemological criticism of the recent quasi-scientific theories of the physical universe, and the last chapters, which sketch the author's somewhat Bergsonian metaphysics, rise under the pressure of unimpeach- able and resistless sincerity to a confessio fidei of deeply moving beauty. The book should be put into the hands of every student to give him the tools of timely criticism, the stimulation.of widening speculation, and an</page><page sequence="10">110 NEW BOOKS. example of how to write on abstract problems with the clarity and gface of natural speech. T. E. JESSOP. Philosophy of the &amp;iences; or the Relations between the Departments of Knowledge. By F. R. TENNANT, D.D., B.Sc., Hon. D.D. (Oxon.). Cambridge University Press, 1932. Pp. x, 191. 6s. IN these Tamer Lectures Dr. Tennant sticks closely to his brief, viz., " the philosophy of the sciences and the relations or want of relations between the different departments of knowledge ", and makes a resolute and in- structive attempt to be both critical and comprehensive. In a sense his conclusion is an approach to theism on the general lines that natural theology " entered on modernity with eighteenth-century deism " (p. 161), and that such a theology, based on a more liberal interpretation of all the sciences than was possible in the eighteenth century, is, if not the inevitable, at least a very plausible culmination of a wide, and withal of a critical, world-view. This point, however, is asserted rather than discussed in the present volume where theology, in the fourth lecture, is almost an intruder, and in the final chapter is, in the main, treated negatively in order to dispel the illusion of unique data in religious experience, such as the " numinous ", or Ritschlian misinterpretations of " consolations, upliftings, bracings of will, joy, peace, etc." (p. 179) (I like the " etc. " both here and on pp. 182 and 183). Regarding the major and non-theological part of the book, it is unneces- sary to inform readers of MIND that Dr. Tennant's knowledge of the sciences is wide and carefully pondered; and I propose to take for granted that these are valuable Tarner Lectures, sedulously planned and efficiently presented. I mention the point explicitly, however, lest any reader should misunderstand me when I maintain, as I mean to maintain, that, in my opinion, some of Dr. Tennant's ideas are very wrong indeed. Let me begin with a minor point. Dr. Tennant says (p. 131) that " realism, idealism and positivism " are refuted, and " phenomenalism " established, by certain elementary considerations about colour-blindness, and the like, mentioned here and in the neighbourhood of p. 70. Such a statement may very well be true, and the view is shared by many com- petent philosophers. On the other hand, these theories (except, perhaps, positivism which, incidentally, Dr. Tennant does not discuss) attempted to meet the alleged" refutations "-for their authors had become ac quainted with such objections with their first philosophical feeding-bottles-and so can hardly be refuted by the mere statement of what they themselves undertook to answer. Similarly, on the positive side, it is surely rather surprising that Dr. Tennant should accept so many of Dr. Ward's funda- mental tenets without any examination of them. It may be true that Dr. Ward has been too much neglected in Cambridge-I have heard Ward himself regretting, very wistfully, that his most eminent pupils seemed to have " gQt " so very little from him-and I am far from suggesting that Dr. Tennant's book is either Ward-and-Meyerson, or Ward-and-dripping. (Indeed, for all I have said, or am going to say, the book may be an admir- able sandwich where Ward is only the bread.) But Dr. Ward has been criticised; and some of Dr. Tennant's readers may be perturbed by the circumstance that Dr. Tennant seems to have paid no serious attention to very many of these criticisms.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 111 I pass to more serious matters. Dr. Tennant after drawing a valuable tripartite distinction between the ordo essendi, the ordo concipiendi, and the ordo cognoscendi argues that the last of these (or, in principle, a psychological and historical method) is alone legitimate (e.g., p. 43). His ground seems to be (p. 24) that this is the only method which possesses a certain " kind " of excellence in that it excels the others in respect of " involving no con- cealed assumptions or foregone conclusions ". So far as I can see, how- ever, this claim is abandoned (e.g., on p. 44) in favour of the quite different claim that psychology alone can elucidate the presuppositions of "know- ledge ". I suggest that the important matter is not how any philosophy begins, but what it can vindicate; and that it is reprehensible dogmatism to say that there is only one genuinely philosophical method. Again, Dr. Tennant is very much enamoured of his " presumptive" method. " I venture to think," he says (p. 76), " that the knowledge which I have set forth concerning the nature of our presumptive knowledge is as stably fixed as, say, the chemistry of water ". I venture to think, on the contrary, and also to hope, that it is as unstable as that fluid. Dr. Tennant's view is, in short (p. 38), " that we possess presumptive knowledge, the ultimate presuppositions of which may in turn be found to be presump- tive " or again (pp. 64 sq.) " probable belief the probability of which is in the last resort of an alogical kind ". If the latter statement means that there is no logic in the position, I should agree with it. The probability of a probability of a probability ... is a vicious infinite; and the apparent modesty of Dr. Tennant's theory is really incoherence. Lastly (although this is to come to an arbitrary stop), I should like to suggest that Dr. Tennant's defence of the thesis that origin does affect validity contains nothing whatsoever of substance. Firstly, he says, (p. 50) that his opponents in this matter have ignored the distinction between " truth " and " truth-recognition" or, as I should prefer to say, between truth and evidence (including "self-evidence ", if any); yet, instead of a reason, he simply asserts (p. 51) that we " generally " need to know something of the history of any known proposition " concerned with actual things and believed to be valid of things ". Nevertheless, on p. 60 he asserts that " certainly the logical connection of ideas is independent of the mode of origination of the ideas " (adding that their knowable applic- ability may depend in part on genetic considerations). Is this " certainly " anything different from " truth-recognition " on Dr. Tennant's part ? And if Dr. Tennant has good logical evidence for the relevance of his psychogenetic theory, would not the logical connection of this evidence be, and be recognised by him as, " independent of its mode of origination " ? Dr. Tennant further charges his opponents with being committed to the untenable views (a) that there must be radical discontinuity between the antecedents of a valid thought and a valid thought-product; and (b) that " immediacy " must normally be accepted at its face value. To (a) the short and sufficient reply is that there is no earthly reason why Dr. Tennant's opponents should not hold that evidence may grow, and be recognised to have -done so. It is ludicrous to suppose that they are bound to treat all the antecedents of sound thinking as non-logical cause- factors like a good night's sleep. And (b), I should say, also requires no answer. No one need hold that all evidence is immediate evidence, although it seems reasonable to maintain that in many cases in which knowledge is immediate, the acquisition of such immediate insight may have been preceded by many tentative and reflective attempts which just missed the point. JOH:N LAIRD.</page><page sequence="12">112 NEW BOOKS. The Mind and its Body. By CHARLES Fox. London: Kegan Paul, 1931. Pp. xii + 316. 10s. 6d. Tns is a somewhat rambling book. The main direction is indicated by the title. In the first four chapters Mr. Fox collects the evidence against the view ordinarily associated with phvsiological psychology. He dismisses localisation with ease, and passes on to the question: Is there necessarily something going on in the nervous system corresponding to everything that goes on in the mind ? This he answers in the negative. Intellection and imagery involve relations which cannot be paralleled by physical relations, and the idea of association centres and speech centres is due to an unfortunate prejudice in favour of an unnecessary hypothesis. It is thought that psychology can only be respectable if it speaks the language of physics or physiology, and this is the position that Mr. Fox very properly at-tacks. His main points are, of course, that no one has been able to point to the correlate of imagery in the brain, and that organisms can do the same sorts of thing-such as learning a habit-when different areas of the cortex are there for them to ' do them with '. Mr. Fox takes the line that the body is used, by the mind, rather than vice versa; that structure is determined by what has to be done, and therefore that mind has priority over matter. The arguments against psycho-physiological parallelism are, I believe, unanswerable. The weakness of the book lies in its giving us no really clear line of advance. Mental energy is quite different from physical energy; on that we may be agreed, but -what we want to know is: how are we to conceive of mental energy ? Professor Whitehead's notion of an organism of which mental events are constituents is noted with approval, but that is too static to be the whole account of the story. We must get the organism on the move. That is the fundamental problem of psychology. For Mr. Fox it is a body-mind carrying out " the spiritual purposes of the person. There are . . . four terms to the relation we are investigat- ing: namely, the person, or ego, spiritual forces, the mind, the living body." And we are told that " the mind is controlled by spiritual forces There are, says Mr. Fox, two senses of the word 'mind'; the 'psycho- plasm', which is closely connected with the body, and the ego which uses the body-mind. This ego seems to be free if freedom " implies the possibility of making a decision on grounds which previously made no appeal to the self ". This is, surely, a strange idea of freedom. If in the course of my studies I become curious about the problem of cellular division and decide to invite a boring biologist to tea in order to extract from him the required information, am I acting 'freely ' ? In some sense I am making that decision on grounds which previously made no appeal to me. Exactly where the spiritual forces come in is hard to say, unless, perhaps, they urge the ego in the direction of value which is apprehended by means of the intellect. X This is not explicitly stated as the direction of these forces, but there is a discussion of value immediately following the postulate of spiritual forces and it is fair to suppose that they have something to do with one another. To account for the humbler activities which fill our lives, we have the concept of 'appetite', but we are only allowed four appetites: hunger,</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 113 sex, herding and communication, and these are not enough to account for the behaviour which falls outside the high enterprises of value, which, after all, play a relatively small part in the lives of many of us. What of our desire for safety, and the satisfaction of curiosity ? Are the spiritual forces responsible for my activities when I buy a revolver in order to defend myself against motor bandits ? If the spiritual forces are responsible for all behaviour, then they are another name for that which has been called by other psychologists, 'libido' or 'hormic urge ', and it is mis- leading not to have said so. If this is not true, then there is a great deal of behaviour which is not adequately accounted for. The truth is that one gets the impression that the word 'spiritual' is being used as a challenge to scientific bigotry, rather than as the name of a concept which helps us to construct a hypothesis for the interpretation of human behaviour. There are other obscurities besides the general difficulty of getting a clear idea of the author's constructive theory. Sensation is much talked of. On page 287 we are told that: "Sensations direct me to objects but are not themselves objects for me ", but on page 293 we are faced by the dictum: " Known a sensation must be ", and how it can be known without being an object is not easy to see. And again it is confusing to be told that " sensations are the means whereby the mind apprehends objects" when two pages before hallucinations are said to be sensations which we have when " no object happens to be present ". There is also a theory of images which calls for elucidation. We do not reproduce exactly the impressions which we have received; this is obvious, but Mr. Fox holds that when we have an image, " what we revive is our subjective states ", and that when unscientific observers say they have vivid imagery, they are making some kind of mistake. We have already been told that subjective states " cannot be cognised but only felt " and yet in this experience we " are misinterpreting affective and conative experiences for cognitive ones ". That we can make mistakes is illustrated by reference to the fact that when we are sitting in a stationary train we often mistake the motion of the train beside us for the motion of our own. Obviously the two mistakes are entirely different. In the train incident we are mistaken in our judgment about the movement of our train, but we report truthfully our impression. In the image situation we are supposed to be mistaken in our introspection. This is plainly false. We cannot be mistaken about our experience, qua experience. It may be that certain affective and conative states must be reinstated for us to have an image, but when we have an image, there is no 'mis- take' about it. The most valuable contribution made by the book lies in the first four chapters. There the experimental evidence is admirably arranged and the argument is clear. In the succeeding chapters there is a great deal of useful information, but the organisation is unsatisfactory and the argument becomes confused, so that when one closes the book, one can say what the author does not believe, but when one tries to say, what he does believe, one is hard put to it to find an answer.

HOLLING- WORTH, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Barnard College, Columbia University. London: Methuen, 1931. Pp. xii, 556. 15s. THIs has the appearance and range of a large text-book, and may be profitably used as such. Besides treating of the generalities of the various schools, it gives a convenient map of the field, is rich in case-material, and provides an up-to-date bibliography. With this and McDougall's Outline of Abnormal Psychology, the student will find himself well introduced to more moderate views of the subject than those that have caught the public eye. After an historical sketch, the author undertakes a lengthy analysis of the chief contemporary points of view, which he designates the neuro- anatomical (which looks for lesions), the physiological (which subordinates neural to glandular, circulatory, etc., dysfunctioning), the psychological, and the psycho-analogical. Chapters follow on mental deficiency, the neuroses (with separate chapters on stage-fright and dreams, stammering, and aphasia), epilepsy, delinquency, the " functional " insanities, types of personality, and drugs. The scrutiny and judgment of these manv interesting details could be made only by a reviewer who has had a wide experience in the practice of psychotherapy. Fortunately it is not necessary, for the book is not a text- book, a compendiumn of results, but a treatise on the principles of the subject. Such a treatise has been urgently needed for some time. Abnor- mal psychology has spent its first years in a somewhat hurried scramble after results, justifiably spurred by the demands of sick souls. Emboldened by its success where medicine has failed, it has generalised with a freedom astonishing to those who are familiar with the logical austerities of science. This may be allowed to pyschotherapeutics, but not to anything that calls itself psychology. The real disaster in the masking of this distinction between an art, ruled by expediency, and a science, ruled by a logical ideal, is that general psychology has taken over untested many of the working guesses of psychotherapists. In consequence, psychology has become logically (not to say morally) impure. This is why it is so egregiously confused and confusing; it has no homogeneity of standards. The chief source of the confusion is psycho-analysis. The rise of biological, physical, and even (as in Spearman) mathematical methods has given rise to con- troversies, but these are fought out within a common though very general sphere of presuppositions; they keep to the realm of science. The strouble with psycho-analysis is that with the sciences it has only two points in common, namely, their naturalism and the hypothesis of universal causa- tion. It entirely lacks their inductive caution, distinguishing itself by the positing of highly imaginative hypotheses and by the use of extremely free analogical inference, so free that not even the germs of a new logic are discernible in it. It is, of course, possible that this alogical procedure is the right one to adopt when dealing with phenomena admittedly so peculiar as those of mind, and in any case the way of understanding has sometimes to be imaginative rather than scientific. But the results of such procedure cannot well mix with the results of scientific investigation; the two groups have no evidential relation to each other. Academic psychologists have no right to be so eclectic as to take over morsels of psycho-analytic doctrine and add them, by mere juxtaposition, to those properly psycho- logical facts and theories that owe both their discovery and whatever validity they possess to altogether different canons of evidence. The recognition of all this seems to me to underlie and be the raison</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 115 d'etre of Professor Hollingworth's book, which is best described as an attempt to restore to psychology its lost homogeneity, lost through the relatively recent widening of its field to include the abnormal. It tries to re-interpret the facts of abnormal mentality in the light of the ideas and principles of normal and orthodox psychology. The procedure is the reverse of Freud's. The attempt obviously requires a definite conception of the general nature of mental process. Professor Hollingworth claims that in his systematic teaching of normal psychology he has felt obliged to define the characteristic pattern of mental activity as response to symbols: a reaction originally evoked by a complex stimulus tends to be evoked by any re- currence of an element of that complex. This, of course, is really a definition of the vague word " learning ", in the wide sense the word has come to bear since the creation of comparative psychology. When the author adds that sagacity is a feature of it he is, I assume, defining normal learning. His present task thus becomes that of showing (1) that all abnormal mental processes exhibit the general pattern of learning in the above wide sense, and (2) that their abnormality consists in the absence of sagacity, or, stated objectively, in the efficacy of irrelevant ingredients of a former complex stimulus. It would require too much space to follow the author in the execution of this task. Most of it is a work of clearance. A neurosis, for example, is traced back to an experience that was a proper reaction to a stressful situation; but instead of giving the 'experience a continiued life in a sup- posititious unconscious, Professor Hollingworth thinks it sufficient to regard it as a moment in the individual's history, not itself persisting, but leaving a more or less persistent association. The only symbolism is that of a part of a stimulus operating for the whole. And the tendency to be swayed by inadequate stimuli, that is, lack of sagacity in response, is con- sidered to be a peculiarity of the individual's make-up, to be explained, if explicable at all, in terms of heredity and variation-a conclusion that seems to me inevitable in view of the patent fact that the situations that generate neuroses occur in the lives of all of us. Stimuli that make some men sick and leave others whole are clearly w6rking on different material. There is also a timely reminder that aetiology is not simply therapy looked at the other way round: successful treatment by glandular extraot, for instance, does not entitle us to infer that glandular trouble was the cause of the neurosis or hysteria or what-not. If devotion to facts, to logic, and to the principle of parsimony may be called levelheaded, the book is eminently sane and safe. It is all the more unfortunate that occasionally, under the stress of polemics, there is overstatement. To assimilate neuroses to normal oesthetic experience (p. 381) is surely an abstract sub- sumption that leaves out the specific nature of each. It is lack of clinical experience that makes those academic psychologists who are dissatisfied with fashionable tendencies modestly hesitate to speak out. Professor Hollingworth has the advantage of familiarity with both sides. His previous books as well as this one testify to long and first-hand work in clinics of many kinds; and it is extremely significant that he is still able to maintain the adequacy for abnormal psychology of the general principles that emerge from the purely theoretical and unhurried study of the normal mind. His thesis consequently deserves' the most careful consideration. T. E. JEssop.</page><page sequence="16">116 NEW BOOKS. Shakespeare through Fastern Eyes. By RANJEE G. SHAHANI. With an Introduction by J. MIDDLETON MuRRY, and an Appreciation by EM:ILE LEGouiS. London: Herbert Joseph, 1932. Pp. 190. 6s. SHAKESPEARE, though still more representative of British mentality, iss the author holds, an adequate expression of the European mind in general, to which the heroic spirit, the spirit of doing and achieving, pre-eminently appeals. This means that the East, with its more distinctive disposition to mysticism, must react differently to the poet's work. To trace the differences in some detail is the object of this very learned and interesting study. Though the antithesis is put very sharply in some places, yet, if we take into account all the qualifications, no very sweeping conclusion is arrived at. It appears that Indians, as well as Europeans, recognise the element of what I have myself ventured to call Indian illusionism in passages where the poet seems to give us a glimpse of his own ultimate thought. And the human element does seem to make the universal appeal that has been claimed for it. Siiakespeare's own freedom from local and temporal limitations of sympathy is illustrated by the popularity in India of the Oriental figures in his plays. There would be much to say on the side of literary criticism; but I limit myself to the philosophical points of com- parison. What appears to be antipathetic to the Indian mind is that Shakespeare in his tragedies has no religious solution to offer. Clear recognition of the fact that this is so, indicates, it must be said, freedom from a preoccupation which has led to many absurdities both in German and in English criticism. A striking example of this offered itself to me when I wrote in MIND (0.S., xiv., 155), a short notice of a work by a German author (written against Schopenhauer's theory of tragedy), in which he maintains that Shakespeare always metes out punishment in exact accordance with the precepts of " poetical justice ". In contrast with Sophocles, " the father of the fate-tragedy ", Shakespeare is " the philosopher of the moral world- order "; and,, by an Elizabethan Englishman, it would be felt that Cordelia was rightly punished for bringing a foreign army into England ! But here, for anyone not mastered by a thesis, is a case where universal feeling transcends differences of time and place. An Indian audience, Dr. Shahani says, rebels against the fate of Cordelia; and here it does not differ from an English or a European audience. Similarly, it is safe to say, no Hegelian thesis about Creon as representing the rights of the State would have made an Athenian audience see in the fate of Antigone an expression of cosmic justice. The fact is that neither -Shakespeare nor Sophocles aimed at representing the visible world as an expression of justice through and through. A:schylus had distinctly a speculative theodicy; which, however, would have required a profound transformation of popular religion. Sophocles and Shakespeare, without offending conservative Athenian or English feeling, gave dramatic utterance to the most profound questioning of the moral order of the world without even implying any solution. Now Indians, as Dr. Shahani points out, are accustomed to having an ultimate religious view set before them which, it is held, makes all things philosophically clear. Hence they in general prefer the romantic comedies of Shakespeare's latest period to a play like King Lear; for in those plays there is a solution, though it may be very artificially devised. (Perhaps the Philoctetes of Sophocles might be classed with them.) In what Dr. Shahani says on the question whether Shakespeare was a</page><page sequence="17">NEW BOOKS. 117 religious man, some apparent discrepancies appear; but these may be considered as part of a dialectical process. In the end, the author's position is plain. The assertion is italicised by himself that wherever Christian doctrines are introduced it is without any tincture of the poet's own person- ality. It may be that, as some have held, the thought behind all religion is that the world 'of appearances is illusory. In that case, Shakespeare is assuredly religious. " But, let us not forget, this is not a Christian view of life ". Nor, as he explains, is it an Eastern view, unless, beyond " Maya " and beyond any possible series of births, there is some Nirvana of the mystics, which would destroy the tragedy. That ultimate mysticism is wanting in Shakespeare, Dr. Shahani argues from a comparison between the stories of Hamlet and of Arjuna, which in some ways resemble one another. In the story of Arjuna, the hero's scruples about entering upon a war with kinsmen is resolved by the explanation of the god Krishna that sub specie aeternitatis slaying and being slain make no difference; his empirical duty is prescribed to him as a member of the military caste. In this he does not fail. Neither,.I would reply, does Hamlet fail on the same terms. When the time has come, he fulfils the duty of blood-revenge prescribed by the ethics of the northern heroic age. It might even be argued that he is all the more a hero because he shows himself ready at the moment without any such single-minded devotion to action as he admires in Fortinbras, and without any revealed solution of a kind that he could welcome. I am not sure that Dr. Shahani would disagree with me; and I find in one passage a suggestion that there is no intrinsic difference in aesthetic theory that is beyond reconciliation by argument between East and West. "Ideal harmony," he says, " is the goal of every 'true artist-in Europe as in Asia." Shakespeare has not less realised this than Sophocles. In both cases it is the Heraclitean harmony made out of discord. " I find this harmony in the tragedies of Shakespeare, and not in the so-called serene plays of his last period. But this is an entirely personal view, and few, if any, Indians will agree with me. For, let us remember, the tragic contemplation of life is not the same thing as the peace of Nirvana." T. WHTTAKER. Heinrich Scholz: Geschichte der Logik. Berlin: 1931. Junker und Diinnhaupt. Pp. vii + 78. EvERYONE would admit that Prantl's great work on the history of logic (1855-70), though not exactly out of date, needs considerable supplementa- tion in the light of recent developments in the theory of logic. It is a contribution to such a supplement that Prof. Scholz has apparently sought to provide. A comprehensive history of logic written from a' modern standpoint is much to be desired. The present work, however, consists of less than eighty pages, and might more appropriately be described as an introduction to the history of logistic than as a history of logic. Prof. Scholz writes throughout as an enthusiastic student of symbolic logic, or-to use the name more commonly employed on the Continent- Logistic. He has endeavoured, with considerable success, to show that, revolutionary though modern developments appear to have been, there has nevertheless been a continuous development from the logical doctrines first suggested by Aristotle to the logical theory of contemporary synwbolic</page><page sequence="18">118 NEW BOOKS. logicians. Indeed, in the opinion of Prof. Scholz, the two founders of Logistic are Aristotle and Leibniz. He recognises that Aristotle could not have formulated the problem of logic in the modern way, since he lacked the necessary apparatus (Riistzeug), namely the algebraic methods intro- duced by the Cartesians; but he goes so far as to assert: " wir die Behaup- tung ffir zulassig halten, dass Aristoteles selbst es so oder ahnlich formuliert haben wurde, wenn er tiber dieses Ruistzeug verffigt hatte " (p. 4). The importance assigned to Leibniz is shown in the following statement: " Wir sprechen von einem Sonnenaufgang, wenn wir den grossen Namen Leibnizens nennen. Mit ihm beginnt ffir die Aristotelische Logik, das 'Neue Leben', dessen sch6nste Manifestation in unsern Tagen die moderne exakte Logik, unter der Form der Logistik, ist. Man kann von den Alten nicht hoch genug denken; aber auch hier ist Leibniz der Mensch-und mit welchem Respekt vor Aristoteles !-, der so weit tiber die Alten hinausgesehen hat, dass etwas wesentlich Neues vor seinen Augen erschienen ist " (p. 48). In the opinion of the present reviewer, Prof. Scholz has done well to emphasize the continuity of the development from Aristotle through Leibniz to the present day, but he seems somewhat to underestimate the significance of the contributions of Frege and Peano, to both of whom surprisingly little space is given. He might well have saved the space taken up by his detailed list of Aristotle's logical writings. Owing to the extreme brevity of the book, and the large number of authors cited, Parts I. and II. (" Die Gestalten der Logik "; " Die klassische Gestalt der formalen Logik "), read rather like an annotated bibliography. Logicians who have not read Prantl's history may be surprised to learn that Stoic philosophers first gave the interpretation of If p, then q in the form Either p is false or q, is true. To the present reviewer this fact is of purely historical interest, since these earlier logicians do not appear to have drawn important conse- quences from this interpretation. In Part III. (" Die moderne Gestalt der formalen Logik ") Prof. Scholz, after a rapid summary of important names from Leibniz to Carnap, deals in his concluding section with the question what we owe to the new logic. His answer is, briefly, that Logistic is the first perfect, formal, exact, logic. Evidently he hopes great things from it. But he is anxious to dissociate himself from the views of the " Wiener Kreis ", who have used logistic as the basis of the metaphysical theory of logical positivism. He says: " Aber das ist bis heute durchaus nicht entschieden, dass eine wissen- schaftliche Real-Philosophie nur aus der Verbindung der Logistik mit einem solchen Positivismus gewonnen werden kann ". He adds: " Ich m6chte vielmehr sagen duirfen, dass es sehr zu bedauern ist, dass der von Carnap so eindrucksvoll reprasentierte 'Wiener Kreis' sich mit einem so fragwiirdigen Satze belastet hat; und sehr nackdrticklich m6chte ich hinzufuigen, dass ich nicht daran zweifle, dass Leibniz auch an dieser Stelle schon viel weiter gesehen hat, als diese in ihrem Felde so sehr zu beachtenden positivistischen Leibnizianer. In keinem Falle steht es so, dass ein iber- zeugter Logistiker nicht zugleich Metaphysiker sein kann, in dem streng determinierten Leibizischen Sinne eines denkenden Menschen, ffir welchen sogar die Gottesfrage als ein durch keinen noch so charaktervollen Posi- tivismus totzumachendes philosophisches Problem mit dem ganzen Gewicht eines solchen existiert ", (p. 65). With this protest the present reviewer is in agreement. No one, however, can deny that the present situation in symbolic logic is extremely interesting, and that it was inevitable that someone should develop these doctrines into such a metaphysic as that of logical positivism. IIf Prof. Scholz succeeds in awakening an interest in</page><page sequence="19">NEW BOOKS. 119 this school and in the modern developments of logic upon which it is based he will have performed a useful service. L. S. S. Die philosophischen' Grundlagen - des Naturrechts: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Rechts- und Staatslehre. Von Dr. JOHANN SAUTJER. Vienna: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932. Pp. ii, 231. RM. 16. To the author of this book the inquiry into natural right should be con- cerned, not only with the system (or systems) of rights supposedly natural to mankind, but also with the nature of 'right' itself; 'and what impelled him to write the book was a conviction that the inquiry cannot be effec- tively conducted, especially if it is construed in this comprehensive way, except in terms of ideas which are philosophical, and even metaphysical, as well as juristic and political. What he offers us, however, is not a direct argument in support of this contention, but an exposition of the ideas which have formed the background for the most important philosophies of right that have been evolved from Heraclitiis to the present-day,- though it is significant that he deals with no non-German writer more recent than Rousseau. In his Introduction, he distinguishes six different schools of' thought on the subject: Plato and Aristotle; the Stoics; St. Augustine and St. Thomas; the Individualists (the Sophists and Cynics, Epicurus, Hobbes and Rousseau); the thinkers of the Aufklarung; the German idealists. And although this catalogue, with some intro- ductory remarks on the Pre-Socratics in the first section, provides him with the main framework for his exposition, he modifies it in one important respect. Transposing the Individualists and the thinkers of the Aufklarung, he confines his consideration of the latter to Puffendorf, Thomasius and Wolff, and expands his consideration of Augustine and Thomas to include, under the comprehensive title of ' Transzendentes Naturrechl ', not only the remaining thinkers who might be supposed to belong to the Aufklhrung, but also the more recent, and even contemporary, representatives of German idealism. The reason for this procedure is no doubt that Puffendorf, Thomasius and Wolff enable him to exhibit, more fully than any other thinkers of that or any other period, the defects of a philosophy of right which neglects metaphysics; but it is unfortunate that a book, of which the only obvious unity is provided by the historical continuity of the authors with whom it deals, should neglect such important historical connections as that between Plato and the Sophists or the earlier and later representa- tives of German idealism. Nor are the expositions, except that of Puffendorf, Thomasius and Wolff, which is developed at much greater length than the others, and is obviously the most important to the author, really of any special value. Owing to his conception of the nature of his enquiry, he is bound to consider the ideas about natural right with which he is concerned in the light of the general philosophical systems of their advocates, and is thus offering not so much a history of these ideas as a history of philosophy in so far as it bears upon them. And though such a history of philosophy might be of considerable interest, we should hardly expect it to be so when confined to the 140 odd pages which remain to him after his consideration of the Aufklarung, at least unless it was characterised either by an original point of view or by unusual clarity of exposition. And although its erudition is obvious, especially in so far as German works are concerned, the book cannot be said to possess either of these qualities; the compression which</page><page sequence="20">120 NEW BOOKS. is forced upon it by the lack of space, no less than the style in which it is written, often makes the expositions difficult to follow, while its occasional deviations from the usual interpretations of the authors under discussion are not likely to commend themselves at all widely. Perhaps these defects will be to some extent remedied in the ' Geschichte der Rechts- und Staatsphilosophie ' which the author announces that he will be publishing shortly ; and no doubt the numerous typographical errors, especially in quotations from Latin and Greek authors, will be corrected in the next edition, if there is one. Presumably the absence, in the copy which I received, of pages 177 to 192 (which appear to contain alnost the whole of the discussion of Wolff), and their replacement by a repetition of pages 161 to 176, can be attributed to a binder's error. 0. DE SELINCOURT. Histoire de la Philosophie. By IIMTLE BREEIER. Tome II. La Philosophie moderne. IV. Le Xixe sieCle apres 1850, le XXC siecle. Index g6n6ral. Paris: Alcan, 1932. 25 fr. M. BREHIER is to be felicitated on having happily brought to a conclusion his comprehensive study of the history of European philosophy from Thales to the present day. (A supplementary part, in collaboration with Mr. Masson-Oursel, which is to deal with Oriental philosophies is promised for the near future.) It is astonishing to see how few of the names of any eminence right down to the present year have been omitted. France is naturally particularlv well represented, and among the sections devoted to living French thinkers, I would specially commend the pages on Bergson for their clarity and sympathetic appreciation. Germany comes off almost equally well, and there is an excellent treatment of Husserl in particular. Great Britain and the United States are perhaps not treated with quite the same fullness, though very few of the names one would look for are missing. There are a few occasional misconceptions, such as are only to be expected in a Continental writer dealing with a theme of such magnitude. Thus Henry Sidgwick rather strangely gets no mention at all, and both F. H. Bradlev and F. C. S. Schiller are described, with a slight technical inaccuracy, as " professors at Oxford," while the late Earl Balfour appears under the unfamiliar designation " M. J. Balfour." It is not exact to speak of Jowett, Mark Pattison and Baden-Powell as the sole authors of the once famous Essays and Reviews, nor to ascribe to McTaggart a belief in a "finite god and perhaps the account of the " philosophy " of the present Earl Russell suffers from a failure to realise that he has held several incompatible philosophies in the course of his life. It is a more serious matter that the sketch of Mill's Logic mentions only his four " direct methods of Induction," without any allusion to his much more satisfactory description of what he called the " deductive method ". And Boole and De Morgan, deserve perhaps something more than a mere passing reference to the titles of their chief works. (I note that the modem " logistic " of Peano, Frege and others goes unmentioned.) Darwin and Spencer are characterised briefly but skilfully and well, though in what is said of Huxley there is no reference to the remarkable volte-face of his Romanes Lecture. On page 983 it seems to me that a sentence introducing the names of F. A. Lange and his principal work has somehow fallen out of the printed text by accident. As the printed</page><page sequence="21">NEW BOOKS. 121 page stands, it passes from a paragraph dealing with Helmholtz to one about Lange without any explanation on the poipt who Lange was or what he was writing about, This abruptness is, I think, without parallel elsewhere in M. Brehier's 1140 pages. The, really remarkable thing is not that M. Brehier should lie open to these criticisms on small matters, but that in less than 250 pages he should have succeeded in saying so much about such a vast number of contemporaries. A. E. TAYLOR. Den Annen Front-Engelske Idealister. (" The Other Front-English Idealists.") 'By A. H. WVINSNES. Oslo, 1932. Pp. 167. 5.00 Kr. THIs history of the English Idealists from Coleridge to Bosanquet is by a Norwegian philosopher and historian who has himself written a biography of the only truly idealist thinker of his country, Niels Trechow. The title shows that the book is directed against the historical, biological and materialistic tendencies of thought that are at present the dominating ones in Norway. In this history' Winsnes has tried to work out the 'wholeness-aspect' of the philosophers he deals with. In the first part he considers Coleridge, Carlyle, Newman and Matthew 'Arnold, whom he calls the " anti-liberalistic critics of culture ". The chapter dealing with Carlyle's deep inner relation to Gxoethe is particularly impressive. The second part, which is headed " the Oxford circle ", deals with Green, Caird, Wallace, Ritchie, Bradley, and Bosanquet, and also contains refer- ences to Sorley, Taylor, and Muirhead. On'the basis of their method and their relation to Hegel, Winsnes characterises them as " anti-pragmatists and critics of abstractionism ". In both parts he pays particular attention to the views of the various philosophers on ethics and the philosophy of the State. Interesting and worthy of attention are the relationships he traces between the English Idealists and certain Norse philosophers like Trechow and Heiberg. The book is written in a very lively style, and deserves to be called the best history of English philosophy written by a non-Englishman since Hdffding. ERNST HARMS. Received also: B.
