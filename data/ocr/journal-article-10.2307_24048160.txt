Molded terra cotta horses. Bactria. 2d—1st c. b.c. generalized form that yet faithfully portrayed the beasts' distinctive characteristics and propor tions, were also widely popular. Typical of these are figures of horses, often carrying riders (fig. 1). There are historical reasons for the widespread production of these terra-cottas in the 2d and 1st centuries b.c. This is the period marked by the incursion of nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples from the northeast, across the Syr Daria, into the ancient urbanized regions of Central Asia. These Saka tribes, having destroyed the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, were in turn pressed by the Yüeh-chih, and one of its tribes, the Kushans, founded a pow erful state in the 1st century a.d. extending from northern Bactria to the Ganges valley in India. The next tribe to appear, the Kangui, established an equally vast, but unstable, state that included Sogdiana, Shash, and Khwarezm. Horse and rider played a significant role in the nomadic and semi-nomadic life of the people whom the Greeks called Scythians. The ceramic riders, modeled with markedly primitive faces and bodies, wear a soft hat rather than the classi cal helmet. Such figurines are generalized guard ian figures of the nomadic riders, most likely rep resenting the forefathers of their kin and tribe. Thus, the figurines are related to the cult of a steppe ancestor brought by the Sakas and Yüeh chih to Bactria.2 However, the popularity of terra-cotta horses (and they are as numerous as the equestrian fig urines) in a highly developed culture in Bactria and in other Central Asian regions could have an other, local, basis, for the horse was held sacred by the followers of the Avesta. It should be noted that I avoid calling this religion Zoroastrian be cause in different places it had local characteris tics different from those of orthodox Iranian Zo roastrianism. This point of view is supported by such archaeological data as the peculiarities of a funeral cult. This unusual celebration of the horse in the countries practicing the religion of the Avesta is related to the horse's role in the economic life of the people and to the importance of cavalry in warfare, as reflected in the Avesta texts. The horse is one of the avatars of Verethraghna, a god of vic tory (Bahr am Yasht 1), and Tishtria, the rain bearer (Tishtr Yasht 26). In their battle with Evil, they appear in the form of white horses, and Tish tria is opposed by a hairless black horse repre senting Apoashi, the cruel personification of drought, that awful specter in the eastern lands. The horse was also worshipped as a symbol of the divine substance, water. That is why the hymns devoted to Ardvi Sura Anahita, protectress of the fruit-bearing forces of nature and of water, speak of the sacrifices made to her by the kings and he roes who sought her protection. Such sacrifices included "a hundred horses, a thousand bulls, and ten thousand sheep" (Ardvi Sura Yasht). Here the horses, as the most valuable, take first place. An ahita herself is shown racing on a chariot: Four horses are in her harness All with coats of white The race is good, so is the height They leave behind the ill intentions of all enemies. Horses also were sacrificed for the souls of the fa mous dead to provide a place for them in the sun lit paradise.3 The horse cult acquired a broader meaning in Central Asia in the course of the first centuries b.c.—a.D., particularly when it was joined to the dynastic ancestor cult. If on the Greco-Bactrian coins of Euthydemus the image of a horse, or on the coins of Eucratides of a horseman/Dioscuros, has a Greek origin, then in later Bactrian numis matics the horse image comes from other sources. After the Yiieh-chih invasion of the northwestern regions of the country, a copper coin was minted that imitated the coins of King Heliocles, the last of the "great" Greco-Bactrian sovereigns. At first, Zeus was shown on the coin reverse, later to be replaced by a walking horse.4 This change may have been dictated by a chief of the Yiieh-chih tribe that had remained in the region, the horse being a more familiar and respected image for the people. It is quite understandable that the horse 16</page><page sequence="3">pugachenkova: Terra-Cotta Horses of Bactria-Tokharistan mixed debris but the majority from specific build ings (such as the temple of the Bactrian goddess at Dalverzin-tepe8 and the burial structure kata uncovered in Kampir-tepe9), have been recovered in northern Bactria-Tokharistan.

It is quite probable that these Chaganian horses, and those of northern Tokharistan in the foothills of Mt. Poly mentioned in the Chinese chronicles, belonged to the unique family of "Lo kai horses" raised in the valleys of the Surkan Darya, Vakhsh, and Pyandj, i.e. in Chaganian and Khuttal. The breed survives to this day. Horses easily adjust to mountainous conditions, unafraid in climbing and descending the rocky slopes. Hence, we may conclude that the ancestors of these horses "not less than two thousand ago car ried the heavy packs of merchants' goods in car avans along the mountain paths on the ancient international trade routes that connected Europe with China."23 Notes 1.
