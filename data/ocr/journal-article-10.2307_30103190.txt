<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGIN OF THE MINOAN COFFIN' AT the turn of the nineteenth century there arose an interest in the origin and development of the Minoan larnax.2 After many years of research it is understandable that we find the views published at that time inadequately furnished with arguments. The scholars of the past investi- gated only some selected questions, because their studies were prompted by the finding of a single tomb containing larnakes, as when in i890 the larnakes at Pentamodi and Vasilika Anogeia were discovered, and P. Orsi published a study on the origin of the chest-larnax. Nevertheless in the early stage of these studies no one could imagine that the coffin chest was a shape of short duration and one which was introduced into burial rites rather late. This is of some importance for the study of the origin of the chest-larnax. There is the very interesting problem of the theoretical background of the views expressed at that time, which we shall here pass briefly in review. The opinions published at the time were influenced by a general theory of culture which was rather vaguely accepted by scholars. The three main ideas were as follows (I) the theory of diffusion,3 (2) the belief in the evolutionary development of society, and (3) a supposition that there existed an interconnection of shape, plan, and to some degree of furnishing between grave and house. Thus three groups of opinions were expressed: (i) the larnax was a borrowed cultural phe- nomenon,4 (2) it was a copy of a Cretan house,s (3) the larnax was a domestic vessel6 (chest, I The materials for the study of the Minoan larnakes were collected by me with the aid of a scholarship from the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, which enabled me to work in Greece. In 1963 the materials were used in my doctor's thesis written under the guidance of Professor K. Majewski and discussed in the Institute for the History of Material Culture of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The present paper is based on the enlarged thesis: Larnaksy egejskie (Aegean Larnakes) (Warszawa-Wroclaw-Krak6w, 1966), in Polish with English summary. I wish to express my thanks to all who have made it possible for me r" complete this work. The paper is a modest expression of gratitude to the British School of Archaeology at Athens, where I was received as a student in 1960. I am also very obliged to the former Director of the School, Mr. Sinclair Hood, whose help proved invaluable in my studies. 2 We do not know the Minoan or Mycenaean terms for the coffins. There is a term in the Linear B tablets read as re-wo-te-re-jo which may denote a bath-tub (see J. M. Cook, 'Bath-tubs in Ancient Greece', Greece and Rome vi2 (1959) 35). But there is no indication that it was applied also to coffins. Some other terms, like pyelos, soros, theke, sarko- phagos, and larnax, are mentioned in ancient testimonia. The last term was the most general, it denoted a house- hold chest (kibotos), but often also a coffin or a receptacle for the cremated dead. It was rectangular, but may also have been oval (II. xxiv. 52, 228, 795; Od. ii. 337, xiii. 1o, 66 ff., xxi. 51 ff. See also S.

The supporters of this theory may have used the representations on some seals with types sometimes depicted as houses or 'rustic shrines' with sloping roofs (Evans, Palace of Minos i, figs. 493 and 494; BSA xl (1939/40) 46, fig. 24; G.

But the sloping roof is known from the oval hut-models, e.g. from Kato Zakro (BCH lxxxvi (1962) 892, fig. 9). 6 For the views of Evans and Bosanquet, see the litera- ture cited in n. 4; S.

In the opinion of the present author there is some truth in most of the expressed views, but theoretically he is inclined to accept that a cultural phenomenon is created as a result of many processes. But here a word of warning is relevant: very often we are not able to discover all the factors which influenced the appearance of some innovation. The most ancient coffins of the East Mediterranean world are known from Egypt. The proto- types of such burial, i.e. the custom of depositing the deceased on outstretched mats and skins, were found in the Neolithic Tasian culture in the fifth millenium B.C. In the Dynastic period the coffin was rectangular or anthropomorphic, made of wood or stone. The rectangular coffins, observed in all the Dynastic periods, were most frequent in the Middle Kingdom. From the Nineteenth and Twentieth dynasties onwards the anthropomorphic sarcophagos prevailed.7 Therefore from the fifteenth to the twelfth century B.c., when the Cretan chest-larnax was in vogue, there were in Egypt no sarcophagi with upper framework standing on feet.8 In the burial-cave near Khudheirah, Palestine, clay coffins were found in the shape of houses with sloping roofs and on feet. The associated pottery was closely related to Ghassulian ware (early fourth millenium B.C.).9 The larnax was also known in Mesopotamia during the Chalco- lithic age, and afterwards, in the Bronze Age. We might call attention here to the Early Dynastic sarcophagi of wicker-work and wood. Clay oval coffins with sloping or flat lids appear from the First to the Third dynasty of Ur and in the Sargonid period.I' In Crete the earliest larnakes appeared in the E.M. period, but then they were rarely used. Only from two areas, central Crete (Pyrgos), and the eastern part of the island (Sphoungaras and Pachyammos) have we some information. In the cave of Pyrgos" about 20 larnakes were discovered, but only two were complete. The coffins were elongated, and the short sides rounded (FIG. I, no. I). The shape of the larnax would suggest that it was a copy of a receptacle made of a tree-trunk. Possibly they were an independent local invention. The origin of the larnax from eastern Crete is another problem. The E.M. coffins from this part of the island are few, and not well known,12 but in the subsequent period they became more frequent. The M.M. examples are oval (FIG. I, nos. 3-7) and have many features typical of clay objects: lids of ceramic nature as in earthenware pithoi, handles, and, sometimes, knobs. The shape, number, and disposition of handles, usually in two rows, were nearly the same on larnakes and on pithoi. We do not observe any sign of wood-working influence in them.'3 In the cemetery of Pachyammos the jars and pithoi were often used as funeral receptacles; they were usually much worn, often with holes, and sometimes a heap of a child's bones was covered by half of a pithos. We have here a very important phenomenon: pithoi of domestic usage became sepulchral receptacles. But even in the most ancient part of the cemetery there appeared clay larnakes of oval shape which were very similar to small pithoi.'4 These small receptacles (FIG. I, no. 2) are evidence, so we 7 C. Hayes, The Scepter of Egjpt (Cambridge, Mass., 1953) i. 13; see also F.

So the larnakes of eastern Crete are domestic vessels slightly altered. This is proved by the following facts: the number of funeral jars and pithoi is much greater than the number of larnakes; a gradual decline in the number of funeral pithoi is quite noticeable, until in the L.M. period they were used only seldom for burials. It is clear that the earliest larnakes were used in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine. But this does not necessarily imply that the burial receptacle was an importation brought to the island of Minos. The coffins in those countries-as far as our knowledge goes-differ usually in detail from the Cretan examples. Even if we find coffins from the Near East similar to those from Crete, there is no connecting link between the two areas in question. So we must seek for other sources of origin of the Cretan larnakes. We observe that usually, perhaps except at Khudheirah, the larnakes appeared at a stage of social development when a rapid differentiation in property holding and a growing trend towards individualism in human needs developed. Such pheno- mena usually follow the development of urban or palace-urban civilization, which developed in Crete in the M.M. I period. Therefore the larnakes in the three main areas, Egypt, Meso- potamia, and Crete, appeared at various times but in a similar social setting, which is a most im- portant fact. That is why the clay coffin, a receptacle very simple in itself, could be an independent local invention. So we believe that the great East Mediterranean civilizations, which developed in close relation to one another, could produce certain parallel but independent phenomena. It was mentioned earlier that larnakes were more common in all the more densely inhabited regions of the island. In eastern Crete there are six cemeteries where larnakes were found; in central Crete, five; and in the Messara plain, three. s But they were not used as often as jars or pithoi. We might suppose that the scarcity of larnakes has some deep cause. We know that the custom of depositing the deceased in jars and pithoi was earlier than the invention of larnakes. These earlier burial rites were so strong and persistent that the new funeral receptacle was not easily acceptable. With the L.M. I period we come into an age when our information on larnakes is scarce.'6 Only a few clay coffins are known imperfectly from the period of L.M. I to early L.M. II. In effect there are three sites, one of which is of uncertain date.'7 It may be that the small number of graves known is due to a very imperfect knowledge of this period especially in the case of cemeteries. We should stress here that the culture of the M.M. III period had undergone a change, and had become more refined. This was chiefly caused by the wealth of the court officials and merchants, or of land-owners and, in the first place, of local kings. The desire to adorn the rooms in palaces and villas more sumptuously was one of the results of the new affluence. It is probable, then, that the wooden chest was introduced into the palaces and residences. We have no remains of wooden chests from this period, but the clay bath-tub from the palace of Knossos shows that wooden structures of considerable size were in use. The frame of one of these bath- tubs, the division into panels and the vertical beams indicate a wooden prototype.'8 It is a time when the tomb architecture is more splendid and gives an impression of the power and importance of the persons buried there. Only a few people could order the building of large 's The list of sites in my Larnaksy egejskie (Aegean Larnakes with English Summary) (Warszawa-Wroclaw-Krak6w, 1966) II6 ff. (later cited as RLE). 16 Hall, op. cit. 6o. 17 Fragments of larnakes dated to the L.M. IA period were shown to Evans in Pyrgos near Kanli Kastelli (Palace of Minos ii, 75); at Trypeti was found a fragment of a larnax with Linear A signs (Evans, op. cit. ii. 83; W. C. Brice, Inscriptions in the Minoan Linear Script of Class A, no. v. I). The chronology of the Kastelli Pediados larnax, dated by Pendlebury to L.M. IB-L.M. II (BSA xxxiii (1932/3) 80) was established from a description by peasants. 18 Evans, op. cit. i, fig. 424-</page><page sequence="5">THE ORIGIN OF THE MINOAN COFFIN 223 and imposing tombs like the Temple Tomb at Knossos. Magnificent sepulchral architecture was followed by more elaborate burial customs. It is probable that even then, M.M. III-L.M. IA, some people were buried in wooden coffins. But no evidence has remained from this period. The scanty remains of coffins are dated to a somewhat later age, the L.M. IB-L.M. II period. From the excavation of tombs on the Hospital Site and at Aghios Ioannis near Knossos we learn that wooden coffins in rich peoples' graves were probably constructed like wooden chests, with a sloping roof and with feet. They were painted in two or three colours (certainly in white and blue),I9 and probably adorned with carved details. This much might be inferred from the fragmentary wooden chest found in the Palace of Knossos.20 There is no doubt that the coffins then used were copies of wooden chests for domestic usage. The use of wooden containers was probably brought about by a new technical skill which made possible the construction of objects of considerable size, as, for example, a chest. Up to the M.M. II period the household objects were few: shelves for storing things, hooks for hanging clothes, earthenware vessels which could be closed and sealed and used as chests. We know, especially from the excavations at the Elias cemetery in Knossos,21 that at the end of the M.M. period various clay coffins were in use, mostly oval, but sometimes also rectangular. These clay larnakes were made like other earthenware vessels, with ceramic-type lids, many rows of handles, and without feet. One feature, the rectangular shape, was already present at times (FIG. I, no. 8); this perhaps shows the influence of wooden chests. We believe that the wooden coffin was a subsequent development of the M.M. rectangular larnax made of clay, but at the same time the new wooden coffins were manufactured by car- penters, so that the new receptacles displayed all the technical devices used in wooden construc- tion. We may therefore suppose that the former rectangular type coffin of the M.M. III period received-when built in wood-the typical division into panels and frame elements, with a sloping roof and feet. So the origin of the L.M. wooden coffin may have been twofold. After a certain period in L.M. I, when we know practically nothing of the clay coffins, a revival took place at the end of the L.M. II period. At that point of time two main types, the chest and the bath-tub were used (FIG. 2). The clay larnakes were really very popular. Nearly all cemeteries and most of the tombs were furnished with clay coffins. From the L.M. III period there are more than I40 sites from all over the island. No less than 500 larnakes were found in various tombs.22 At the same time the wooden larnakes were used rarely. The bath-tub and the chest were developed from earlier Cretan prototypes. The bath-tub- shaped coffin was a development of an earlier household utensil, and the chest-larnax was a continuation of the wooden coffins of which we have some information in the L.M. IB-L.M. II period. The clay chest-larnakes of the L.M. III period preserved a considerable number of elements of wooden vessels. The division into two or three panels, the firm side-element, the more or less sloping roof, the roof-element sometimes hexagonal in section,23 the feet, and the fact that stamped decoration was applied exceptionally24-all show how strong was the tradition of wooden chests. Sometimes we even find a trace of a still older tradition, e.g. the handles on a larnax from Gypsades25 are placed exceptionally low, a practice rare in the L.M. period but very popular in the M.M. period.

I-L.M. II period account for the larnakes being copied in the regions more exposed to Cretan influence.26 But in the funeral rites the use of coffins was of no great significance, possibly with one exception.27 In the chamber tombs at Mycenae only one fragment of a larnax was identified, and many hundreds of burials must surely have been deposited in graves with no coffin.28 The influence of Crete was also observed as far as Cyprus, where a fragment of a stone sarcophagus decorated with the 'horns of consecration' was found.29 A very rapid decline in the use of larnakes occurred at the end of the Bronze Age. But even later they were seldom used. The larnakes were out of use in the period of general changes in burial customs, when cremation was in vogue, i.e. in the Protogeometric and Geometric periods. But even then, as the finds from Rhotasion and Sikias30 testify, larnakes were sometimes used. In the Geometric period the larnakes were reused but seldom, which proves that the ancient burial receptacles were treated with due respect.3' The survival of the civilization of the Bronze Age into the Iron Age is much discussed. But it is difficult to prove the continuity in material culture between the Mycenean period and later Greek times.32 The scholars who believe that the survivals took place not in the main centres but in remote rural regions, especially in Crete, may be right.33 Far better studied are the survivals of some religious concepts and cult ceremonies.34 We know also that there are serious grounds for the belief that some of the myths originated in the Bronze Age. Here we may recall myths which could be interpreted as an echo of burial customs from the Minoan period. One of the burial ceremonies is probably reflected in the tale of Glaukos who, according to the myth, fell into a jar full of honey and found his death in it. This tale was widely known in ancient Greece and was many times illustrated by Greek artists. In this myth A. Persson35 sees a reality in the background which has survived from the Bronze Age. The placing of the dead, particularly children, in jars (possibly filled with honey), was a funeral rite very popular in Middle Bronze Age Greece. Another myth, also of great antiquity, is to be found in the tale of Agamemnon killed in a bath-tub or rather in a bathroom. Probably Evans was right in supposing that this myth reflects the custom of burial in bath-tubs of the Minoan Age.36 The myth of Danae and Perseus and others related to this also give important indications- in our opinion-of ancient burial customs.37 Danae, together with her child, was condemned to death, enclosed in a chest,38 and cast into the sea.39 26 Specially in Argolis, Attica, Boeotia, and Thessaly, and on the islands of Naxos and Rhodes; see E.

This custom survived down to the early Greek times, and later disappeared or changed radically.40 But the still living memory of the past was the chief reason why the legends were widely known. FIG. 3 (see n. 44) That is why the motive of enclosure in a chest-once a real and common custom-could denote that a person was dead. The enclosing in a larnax, a chest-coffin, was an allegory mean- ing that a person was dead. The Minoans believed that the deceased was on his way to the Island of the Blessed-hence so many marine motives on larnakes-and so it was necessary to cross the sea.4' The main elements of the earlier belief are found in proper disguise in the myth 'Golden Age'. Cook, op. cit. iii. I, 458, thought that the representation of the Danae chest (our FIG. 3), decorated with star-rosettes was related to the decoration of ancient coffins. But it is impossible to accept an influence of Mycenaean coffin decoration on the Athenian art of the fifth century B.c. 40 We believe that there was another tradition which influenced the Clazomenian sarcophagi. Neither did the sporadic use for burials of bath-tubs in classical Greece originate in Mycenaean usage. 41 The late Professor E. Grumach kindly sent me his paper 'The Minoan Libation Formula again' which was delivered at the Mycenaean Symposium at Edinburgh in 1966. He wrote: 'The dead (person) has to cross the sea or river of death in order to seek the Island of the Blessed . ...' We must also call attention to the unpublished larnax from Episkopi in the Ierapetra Museum. It has been mentioned many times: Fasti Arch. i (1946) 96, no. 767; Kretika Chronika i (I947) 633, 638; JHS lxvi (1946) I 18; BCH lxxxi/ lxxxii (1947/8) 441; Anz. Alt. (Vienna) iv (I951) 15; Kretika Chronika viii (i954) 219; RLE 218, no. 29 c. and discussed at some length by E. T. Vermeule, op. cit. 124. Here also there is-in our opinion-a reflection of the journey to the Island of the Blessed. The main panel possibly depicts a symbolic departure of the dead person, with his atten- dants who hold disc-shaped standards (not fans) on high sticks. The departed person drives the chariot himself. On the lower part beneath the harnessed animal there is a series of ornaments like reversed V's, which according to the convention prevalent in the Minoan and Mycenaean art denote rocky land (E. T. Vermeule believes they are waves). Above the chariot-pole there is also a row of orna- ments similar to those beneath the animal. Here it may mean another indication of the land or-which seems much simpler-a rope on the chariot-pole. In the left corner of the panel, between the harnessed animal and the chariot there is a polypod. In the upper right corner, above the animal, there are three persons with hands uplifted. One of them is holding a kylix, the other is just throwing down a kylix. We may recall that in many tombs the broken kylikes were found in the dromos. Therefore, as we believe, the whole scene could be interpreted as having a double meaning, real and imaginary. At the end of the funeral the li- bation was made, the mourners pouring out the liquid from the kylikes, and this was the real part of the funeral rite. At the same time the family of the dead believed that the deceased was going to the other world. The moment of setting out on the great journey was indicated and the prospective crossing of the sea marked by the polypod below the chariot. This was the imaginary part of the scene. Of</page><page sequence="9">THE ORIGIN OF THE MINOAN COFFIN 227 of Danae and Perseus. The enclosure in the chest, as a recollection of real fact, was combined with an element imagined only, the floating on the sea, and later discovery and rescue on an island. If therefore in early myths the motive of enclosure in a chest had a real meaning, denoting that somebody was dead, so later when the custom of burial in the chest-larnakes died out, the motive was hardly understandable. For the poets of the Classical period a chest was merely a piece of household furniture. Under the influence of early fifth-century poets42 the vase painters decorated their pottery with the Danae theme43 (FIG. 3).44 It is interesting that this motive with all its variants and modifications was also present in the Christian legends, especially of St. Barbara and St. Irene. BOGDAN RUTKOWSKI course, there are many other very important questions which will not be properly answered until the larnax is published. To the list of four L.M.
