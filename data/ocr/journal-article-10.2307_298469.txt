All, except the first, published by Librairie Gallimard, Paris. This series of monographs, all of modest size, has attracted a considerable amount of attention in the country of its origin and the views of its author have found followers both in France and, as I gather, elsewhere. It seems, therefore, worth while to criticize those views at some length, and I have gladly accepted an invitation from the editors of the Journal to do so. The author is a man of considerable linguistic ability, familiar with the classical languages and also Sanskrit, Old Persian, Irish, and other tongues of use to a comparative mythologist. He often, particularly in criticizing the views of opponents, shows not only acuteness in argument but also strong good sense; I would cite, as one instance out of several, his repudiation of the unduly wide conclusions which have been drawn by many writers from the existence in a given region of the rites of cremation- and inhumation, Naissance de Rome I33 if. If therefore I express total disagreement with his theories, I am not pointing out the errors of an incompetent pretender to knowledge but setting out to prove that a scholar has had the misfortune to wander into a blind alley of speculation. His fundamental position, as I take it, is in itself perfectly sound. The people, whoever they may have been and wherever they originally lived, who spoke the parent tongue of the Indo-European, or, as I prefer to call it, the Wiro group, had undoubtedly a culture of their own, though not a high one, as witness the absence of common names for most of the metals. When their idiom spread, something of their manners and customs spread with it, and therefore to examine the antiquities of one people speaking a descendant of the original language seems, at least a priori, a promising way of throwing light on those of another. All this is a commonplace, modified indeed by the advances in ethnology which have been made since the existence of the group of languages was scientifically established in the early days of comparative linguistics, but still recognized as containing a large element of truth. Hence, if Dumezil looks to India or the Keltic world to clear up the many difficulties and obscurities of pre-Republican Rome, there is no methodological objection to raise; his results must be examined on their merits. Before stating his position, it should be noted that he has two somewhat hampering deficiencies. He does not pretend to a competent knowledge of archaeology (Naissance I49), and the regularity with which he speaks of the Indo-Europeans as if they were ethnologically homogeneous, one people on the move, however much conquest and settlement in foreign lands may have later modified them, suggests assumptions now out of date. It is a fact, for instance, that Wiro speech reached Italy in prehistoric times; it is not an established fact that those who brought it were in any sense the blood relations of those who introduced the Hellenic language into Greece, or Goidelic and Brythonic into the British Isles. It is unfortunately true that we have scanty information, or none at all, of how the language spread, and especially what part was played in its distribution by the movements of popula- tions not originally Wiro who had adopted the tongue of Wiro-speaking conquerors or other foreigners. Hence all conclusions from known custom or belief to those earlier forms which a researcher may postulate as lying behind them are subject to the objection that the reconstruction which is true, for example, in India may be worse than useless when the country to be investigated is Greece, Wales, or Italy. With this much by way of preface, I now proceed to outline Dumezil's hypothesis. In India, behind the present intricate system of castes, there has existed from early times the fundamental division of the people into three great classes, the Brahmans, to whose order belong, originally, the kings also, the warriors (Ksatriya), and the cultivators and herdsmen (Vai9ya). All who do not belong to one of these groups are foreigners and casteless, C,udra, and therefore need not be considered when investigating the original society. He claims not only that such fundamental divisions exist, for instance, in Iran, but that primitively they were to be found in Rome, where they have left traces in the flamens (he accepts the etymological equivalence offiamen and brahman), the iuuenes, especially the equites, who perform military service, and finally the Quirites, whom he takes to be originally that portion of the community which tilled the soil and raised and tended the cattle. Within these classes there exists at least one very marked opposition, recurring again and again in legends and myths; it is that between the ' terrible' type of king, who is regularly a magician also, and the milder and juster monarch. In Indian mythology these are ' projected' as two great gods, later</page><page sequence="2">I 84 REVIEWS AND DIJCUSSIONS fused almost into one, respectively Varuna and Mitra. These Dumezil finds again in Juppiter and Fides, or Dius Fidius, while on earth they are to be seen as Romulus and Numa. Matters are com- plicated, for India, by a third deity, Indra, who represents the chivalrous ethics of the warrior class and on occasion opposes Varuna; in Italy he has his heavenly parallel in Mars, his earthly representative in Tullus Hostilius. Of the sundry Keltic and Germanic parallels adduced I do not mean to speak, nor will I criticize the justness of the conclusions so far as they refer to Indian mythology; I assume that the material preserved in Sanskrit and Old Persian has been correctly interpreted, and confine myself to the Italian field. For details of the scheme, see Mitra- Varuna i if. There is also, still in the Indian tradition, a disturbing element, the unruly Gandharvas, ' une bande d'etres surnaturels, un peu divins, un peu demoniaques .. . les hommes peuvent s'y agreger par une initiation.' Their name, still according to Dumezil, is etymologically the same as that of the Centaurs-an old suggestion-and probably also radically identical withfebruum (Mitra-Varuna ii), an etymology which I do not remember to have come across before. Leaving this philological question to others to decide, I note that all three countries, India, Greece, and Italy, are credited by the author with having a kind of disorderly secret societies, mythologized in two of them into super- natural beings, while in the third we have the purely human Luperci. Their alleged origin (in Ovid, Fast. ii, 365 ff.) from the pastoralis iuuentus which followed the Twins is stressed, also their rough fertility-rite, the striking of all whom they met with their goat-skin thongs; they are a ' fauve et brutale confrerie', one of those secret or half-secret organizations of men only which are to be found up and down the world in barbarous societies and ' n'effleurent (mais alors souverainement) dans la religion publique que pour prendre le contre-pied du jeu normal de cette religion ' (ibid. 8). I have seen many unlikely explanations of the Lupercalia, and do not for a moment suppose that my own (in Mnemosyne lx, 385 ff.) has satisfied everyone; but this strikes me as quite the most unlikely. The rite, whatever else it may have been, was essentially the tracing of a magic circle around the Palatine settlement, to keep wolves (and perhaps other evils) out, fertility in. The Luperci, as the names of their two subdivisions, Fabiani and Quintiliani, attest, were connected with two old gentes, suggesting that the rite was originally one of the many sacra gentilicia; there is not a word in any of our descriptions of them and their ceremonial which suggests either an initiation or any kind of disorder or removal of ordinary restrictions, such as we find in those quite numerous festivals (the Saturnalia appear to be a tame and worn-down remnant of one) in which, perhaps to the benefit of tne participants' nerves, repressions imposed by,custom are for the time being set aside. However, this is not a principal part of Dumezil's theories, and I return to his main argument. His three classes were to be found, he believes, in Rome, as already stated, and each class had its own god, respectively Juppiter, Mars, and Quirinus. To the demonstration of this the second work listed at the head of this review and a considerable part of the last are devoted. That Juppiter was closely connected with sundry priesthoods, notably with the office of his own priest, the flamen Dialis, is naturally no secret, nor does anyone dispute that this connection belonged to the old, pre- Capitoline god, before Etruscan influence came into play. But I cannot find in him any trace of the figure who apparently is visible to the eyes of our ingenious author. He compares him (Mitra- Varuna IOI, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus 8i) to a powerful magician, an Odin, appearing in the midst of a battle to break the sword of an enemy on his spear, which never is used as a weapon, and strike terror into the party destined to be overthrown. All this, apparently, on the strength of the tale that Juppiter answered Romulus' prayer to stay the rout of the Romans fighting the Sabines, and so got the title of Stator. Frankly, the only resemblance I can see is that there is a divine intervention, otherwise than by the epiphany of a god in the form of a warrior, in both cases. This is so common an occurrence in the mythology of all nations who have such a thing that it cannot characterize a god as being of any particular kind. If it makes Juppiter a celestial ' terrible king ', then the same thing must hold good no less for Mars, the Lares, the Indigetes and the rest of those invoked, in the formula of deuotio (Livy viii, 9, 6-8), ' uti populo Romano Quiritium uim uictoriam prosperetis hostesque p. R. Quiritium terrore formidine morteque adficiatis,' in fact to do at least as much as Juppiter did for Romulus. Yet Mars, when he intervenes, does so in a much more anthropomorphic fashion, or so Dumezil declares (Jupiter Mars Quirinus 8i), on the strength of the anecdote in Valerius Maximus i, 8, 6, as patently Hellenizing a story as ever was set down in Latin. If I cannot see the type of god Dumezil postulates in Juppiter, still less can I find any trace of a time when there was a caste or exclusive corporation of priests at Rome; indeed he himself admits (Naissance I75 f.) that the traces of any such classes are very faint, and supposes them done away with about the beginning of the Republic by a considered political process. The only facts with which I am acquainted tell me that, given patrician birth, in other words full citizenship, any adult male Roman might become a priest, and that, in the vast majority of cases, without losing touch with secular activities in peace and war; but that no one was ever a priest by right of birth, or even of a special</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS AND DISCUSS'ONS I85 course of study comparable to the conning by learned Brahmans of the scriptures of their nation According to circumstances and date, the priest was captus, elected, or co-opted to his functions' went through his formal inauguration, and so entered upon his duties. Mars, still according to Dumezil, was the god of the second class, the warriors, whether they were originally called celeres or by some other name. He insists on his character as a war-god, which in my opinion is a misconception; a war-god pure and simple is not easy to find anywhere in Europe, even Ares not being an undoubted instance. That Mars is a warlike god is as certain as that he is pan-Italian; it is not so sure that his name belongs to the Wiro language. Our oldest document, the Arval hymn, styles him ferus and prays that he will not let plague and destruction, luem ruem, go any farther, but himself take up his post on the limen, presumably the boundary-mark of the ager Romanus, to guard it (Ed. Norden, Aus altremischen Priesterbiichern I36 ff. ; I agree heartily with the dictum on p. 137, ' er [Mars] umfasste die Daseinsbedingungen des baiuerlich-kriegerischen Italertums '). Here, if we follow the lines of Dumezil's theories, we have the spiritual descendants of Romulus' own foster-brothers praying, not to the ' terrible ' divine king Juppiter but to the god of the second class of the community, not of their own, and furthermore, addressing the Semunes, whoever exactly they may be, and the Lares, who certainly are deities of the farmer-class, if ever such a class existed separately from the mass of the people. But this warrior-class, it would seem, had its initiations, in Italy and elsewhere, and they took the form of a ritual combat, regularly against an enemy who was in some way triple, whether three individuals or a monster with three heads or some such peculiarity, see especially Horace et les Curiaces 50 ff. The object, apparently, of this was to work up a desirable state of battle-rage, which could, when no longer wanted, be cooled down by physical or magical means. He cites (ibid. 34 ff.) the first exploit of Ciuchulainn, the Ulster hero, in which he fights and kills three brothers, returning home in one of his wild rages which the documents describe in wilder language. He is, however, abashed by the sight of naked women sent to meet him, and so is seized, plunged into cold baths and restored to normality. Here Dumezil finds a satisfactory Roman parallel, the story of Horatius, or rather the HIoratii, and the Curiatii. The death of his two brothers leaves the surviving Horatius with three opponents ; he emerges victorious, comes home and is confronted by his sister. She, poor girl, is obliged for the purposes of the theory to be stigmatized as une impudique, because she runs out into the crowd who are welcoming her brother and does not stay modestly in the house (Horace io6 ff.). Furthermore, her presence was ' une tentation sexuelle directe ' (ibid.), though nothing in Livy indicates that he thought her shameless or her brother a pathological case. By parity of reasoning, Verginia must have been a brazen little hussy, for' uenienti in forum . .. minister decemuiri libidinis manum iniecit', Livy iii, 44, 6. It is true she was accompanied by her nurse, ibid. 7, but nothing in i, 26, indicates that Horatia was unattended. Be that as it may, so far from helping to calm her brother's battle-fury (of which, by the way, his cool conduct during the fight had given no sign; he was ferox, 25, 5, feroci animo, 26, 3, but this is no more than confident and high-spirited, cf. for instance ii, 56, 6, where a good war record has made Laetorius ferociorem, thus moving him, not to kill anyone, but to force a bill through), she inflames it and he strikes her down for lamenting her betrothed. Then the story goes on approximately as for the champion of Ulster; Horatius indeed is not ducked, but his namesake Horatius Cocles ended his exploit by swimming the Tiber, and he himself has to submit, after his acquittal, to a ceremony of purification. To be frank, I can see neither a resemblance between the two stories close enough to justify anyone in presuming a common source, however far away in place or time, or the least hint in either that the original tale was the iEpos Moyos of an initiation into the military or any other class of any people. At all events the Horatii had already seen service, Livy i, 24, i, and the archaeological indications (ibid. 25, I4; 26, IO, 14) make it plain enough that the tale had grown, whether in popular belief or the speculations of antiquaries, from certain old monuments, tombs and a pillar, added to the strange ritual of the tigillum sororium (26, 13). The technique of finding an older legend in a newer one is surely familiar ; gaps and inconsistencies in the later narrative point to the places where it has been revamped to suit the taste or belief of its age. Livy's story, whatever his source may have been-Quellenforschung seems to lie outside Dumezil's province-is a perfectly self-consistent whole, producing the impression that it was turned out at one time by a single author. Who applied it to the ideal hard case in law, to be put right by the sovran prerogative of mercy exercised by the people, it is too late to inquire. I have no space to comment fully on another curious detail relative to Roman heroes, that Scaevola and Horatius Cocles are declared the local equivalents of sundry half-blind, one-handed or otherwise disfigured personages of the mythology of other peoples (Mitra-Varuna iII ff.), save to note the extraordinary argument by which at one point (ibid. ii6 ff.) it is supported. Cocles impresses his Etruscan opponents by his courage and his truces oculi (Polyb. vi, 55, 2 Livy ii, IO, 8, where clearly he is not one-eyed). This, apparently, is the Roman version of the elaborate</page><page sequence="4">i86 REVIEWS AND DISCUSSIONS grimaces and other magical performances by which the alleged parallels in other countries achieve their ends. Quirinus is the deity of Dumezil's third class, the Quirites, whom he supposes represented by the traditional Sabines under T. Tatius. So little is known of this local deity that it is hard to think of any plausible proposition concerning him which can be disproved by cogent evidence, and so when he is set down as an agricultural god and his people a farmer- and herdsman-class, a case can be, and is, made out for the theory. Yet it is noteworthy that some of the proofs adduced are of the very same kind which Dumezil rejects when he is dealing with Mars (Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus 9I ff.; the flamen Quirinalis is known to have taken part in the Consualia, the Robigalia, and the Larentalia, whereof two certainly and one perhaps are agricultural festivals; therefore he is con- nected with agriculture). However, the traditional Sabines are also the Tities, for the Roman view of history turned the functional classes into ethnological units making up the nation. Or rather (Naissance I28), they 'unissaient une idee ethnique et une idee fonctionelle des trois composantes de la Ville ', but the former was much the stronger, resulting in a reversal of the true picture of affairs in their primitive community. Traces, however, of what once existed subsist here and there, and one of the primary documents, if interpreted according to the right methods, i.e. Dumezil's, is Propertius iv, i, especially 27 ff. (Jupiter 136 fi.; Naissance 86 if.). Certainly the three tribes are mentioned there, and with some elaboration; it remains to be seen, firstly, whether Propertius is drawing upon anything more than his owI1 imagination for details, secondly if he really does hint at anything like a functional difference between Ramnes, Luceres, and Tities. He has been describing at considerable length the extreme simplicity of early Rome, a hut for the Twins to live in, the Senate meeting in an open field, the poorness of the religious ceremonies. In lines 9-26 the whole description is of the Ramnes, according to Dumezil (despite the Quirites of i3 and the arator of 25, which on his own postulates seem to go against any such idea). Now the description continues- Prima galeritus posuit praetoria Lygmon, magnaque pars Tatio rerum erat inter ouis. hinc Tities Ramnesque uiri Luceresque coloni, quattuor hinc albos Romulus egit equos. The first line he would interpret (Naissance 93) to mean that until the arrival of Lygmon-Lucumo, the founder of the tribes of Luceres, the Romans knew nothing of the art of war; he gave them their prima praetoria, first regular camp, although he still had no bronze or steel helmet to wear but only a leather cap, galerus. The author himself admits that other interpretations are possible, ibid., and on so fundamental a passage, for his theories, as this one, that in itself badly weakens a shaky case. At all events, why should prima praetoria not be ' his (Lygmon's) first camp ' ? That Lucumo, or rather the ' lucumo ' who brought his Etruscan contingent to Rome was warlike is part of the story and admitted on all sides. It gets us no nearer to a warrior class, especially as two lines farther on the Luceres are described as coloni, which means solely and simply ' farmers'. The herdsman class is to be represented by Tatius with his wealth consisting of sheep, and thus, although Propertius could not have known that functional classes once existed, ' la tradition dont il se fait l'echo se repre- sentait encore, sans comprendre le sens de ces liaisons, Tatius et les Tities comme des 6leveurs, Lucumo et les Luceres comme des guerriers, et le reste de la societe, les Ramnes, comme occupes surtout du gouvernement et de la religion' (Jupiter 140, repeated, Naissance 9I). Even if this were so, and it seems to me a most forced interpretation of Propertius' lines to take them thus, what is this mysterious tradition which finds its echo in him ? He, in his new enthusiasm for the early history of Rome, would turn to the antiquaries of his day, especially no doubt to Varro, and in them there was no popular tradition, but learned reconstruction, starting from facts of topography and cult and little, if at all, influenced by any kind of folk-memory. I have but given samples of Dumezil's arguments, omitting for instance the curious line of reasoning which, in Servius et la Fortune, seeks to trace a connection between that king's census and the Skt. root fams, which it seems develops the meaning of praise duly given a good raja who maintains the stability of organized society. I have said nothing of a multitude of details, not essential to the main hypothesis, which seem to me to rest upon absurdities and misunderstandings, for no author should be judged by small incidental slips, and Dumezil frankly admits several of his, Naissance 34. But it appears to me that the considerations urged in this sketch are enough to show the frailty of the foundations which are made to carry so imposing a superstructure. U. J.
