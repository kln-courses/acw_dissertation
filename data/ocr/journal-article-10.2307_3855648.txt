Through these scenes the king's battle-triumphs are seen to be blessings bestowed by the gods, and the implied link between religion and the nation's military prowess is, of course, a widespread phenomenon. J. GWYN GRIFFITHS Gott und Mensch nach den dgyptischen Tempelinschriften der griechisch-romischen Zeit. Eine Untersuchung zur Phraseologie der Tempelinschriften. By EBERHARD OTTO. Abhandlungen der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.-hist. Klasse. Heidelberg, 1964. Pp. I96. DM 36. Gott und Mensch stands out typographically as the substantive title of this work. As such, of course, it is too expansive, but an accurate complementary description follows. Lest even this might be deemed to be too ambitious a denotation, Professor Otto has added a sub-title, and in his introduction he explains that his study is based on the analysis of a large number of religious phrases and expressions emanating from the temples of the Ptolemaic and Roman eras. The phrases studied are derived mostly from texts relating to cult and ritual, and their selection is based on their relevance to the general theme. It is stressed that an exhaustive record is not intended and that this is not a 'phraseological lexicon of the temple-inscrip- tions'; furthermore, it was not possible to use the recent publications by Junker, Sauneron, and Firchow of texts from Philae, Esna, and Thebes respectively. A considerable range of material has none the less been included, and the results of a detailed study are presented under the headings 'Statements about God', 'Man and the World before Deity', 'The Role of the King', and 'The Idea of God and Cult Reality'. An excursus deals with 'The inter-relation of the polarized concepts wnmt--ibt (right and left eye); nh.h-dt (endlessness and eternity): nySwt-bity (King of Upper Egypt and King of Lower Egypt)'. There is a long (pp. 95-I63) alphabetical compilation of the more common expressions and epithets, followed by a word- index and an autographed hieroglyphic appendix. It is difficult to indicate in a review the usefulness of this wide-ranging study. In essence it is a careful and well-documented compilation which is equipped also with illuminating remarks on a large number of separate items. In addition the author attempts a general synthesis. A strongly anthropomorphic picture of the gods emerges, save that omnipotence, omniscience, and related qualities are often assigned to them. The claim to uniqueness is often ascribed too in expressions like nn wn mity.f, 'his like does not exist'. The formula is used of the king as well, and also of buildings; it is shown to derive from the biographical litera- ture of the Middle Kingdom. It follows that no monotheistic tendency can here be associated with the concept of uniqueness. A constant feature of the treatment is the attempt to correlate and derive the ideas encountered, and in this way the book is much more than a guide to concepts attested in the eras with which it is specifically concerned. Very often there are abundant earlier prototypes. An interesting exception is the idea of a primitive paradise in Edfou, v, 85 which Otto thus translates: 'Ma(at came from heaven to earth. She consorted with all the gods. Nourishment and food were abundant without limitation. There were no evil-doers (isftyw) in this land. The crocodile did not ravage, nor did the serpent bite in the time of the primaeval gods.' Similar allusions were collected by Sethe, Amun und die acht Urgotter von Hermo- polls, 63; cf. Sethe-Firchow, Urk. vIII, 76 and 8I. Otto concludes, 'with all due reserve', that the idea is not of Egyptian origin, and tentatively suggests that there may either be Gnostic influences, with an equa- tion of Ma'at and Sophia, or that Hesiod's scheme of ages may be reflected here. One is reminded of Walcot's thesis that the Instructions of (Onchsheshonqy reflect the influence of the Opera et Dies: see JNES 2i (1962), 215-19; certainly he has discovered some striking resemblances. It may be questioned whether Otto has given proper weight to the early Egyptian ideas of a primitive age of bliss when the gods ruled, notably Horus or Rec.I Whereas the texts of the Graeco-Roman era to which he refers introduce new details into the picture, the contrast between Macat and isft (cf. isftyw in the passage quoted) is as early as Pyr. 1775 b (N); see further Morenz, Agyptische Religion, 121 f. A remarkable feature of the king's role in these inscriptions is his frequent assumption, in certain ritual procedures, of priestly titles, a phenomenon which apparently occurs first in the Ptolemaic era. Otto notes In addition to Grapow, 'Die Welt vor der Sch6pfung', ZAS 67 (93), 34 ff. which Otto cites, cf. F. L. Griffith in Hastings, ERE i (1908), 192 a; J. Gwyn Griffiths, 'Archaeology and Hesiod's Five Ages', Journal of the History of Ideas, 17 (1956), 109-19; R. T. Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt (London, 1959), 263 f.</page><page sequence="2">222 REVIEWS that some of these titles, such as iwn-mwtf, si-mrf, and gm, had in origin denoted functions of gods, so that their earthly bearers derived an exaltation therefrom. In the Ptolemaic era a generally heightened valuation of priestly titles is observable in the sense that they are applied to both gods and kings. It is suggested that since the New Kingdom the priesthood achieved a measure of independence vis-i-vis the kingship and released itself from its merely representative position. At the same time the kingship became secularized, and in order to justify anew the king's essential ritual roles, he was received into the circle of the legitimate partners of deity, namely the priests. This is a convincing explanation of the change. Perhaps the most difficult of the tasks here essayed is the interpretation of the ideas implicit in the pro- cedures of cult and ritual. Offerings to a god are often made on the principle of Do ut des, while in other rites mythical events are enacted in order to maintain the universe in order. Otto feels that the approach of the Ptolemaic temples is somewhat different: there is now a special directness or immediacy of relation- ship between gift and counter-gift, and the prominence given to this idea is achieved by the exclusion of the mythical element. he presentation of the wdit-eye, for instance, in spite of its rich mythical associa- tions, concentrates its attention in these texts on the concept of physical health, which God is expected to preserve, and on the happy conjoining of God and man through light; one is constrained to give a very wordly sense to one's application of the term 'symbol' to the object of the offering or of the rite. At the same time the cult-object and ritual procedure achieve a new and wider currencv of meaning, even if it is fully anthropocentric; and the original intention of the rite is actualized in a new way. Otto cautiously adds reservations to this interpretation: the approach may be attested before the Ptolemaic era, and in any case it does not affect the context of the daily ritual or the mythological background of festival rites. There are acute remarks on the fluidity of the gods' functions and of their epithets in these texts; this is contrasted with the reality effected in the cult, a reality which becomes an expression of a new and direct cosmic relation between the deity, the cut-oject and the an orld. One wonders whether the interchange- ability of the gods may not be a mark rather of an attenuated belief in their distinctive powers. Otto well stresses that it is the rite that confers a particular association on the god, and not the traditional epithet which may be attached to him; for instance, the presentation of the eatfigure demands of the deity to which it is presented a care for righteousness and correctness even in earthly matters, without regard at all to whether this deity is primarily and mythologically connected with the concept of Ma&lt;at. Otto queries the value of applying terms like immanence and transcendence, or polytheism and monotheism, to the elucidation of Egyptian religion, but he has little doubt that the Egyptian gods are regarded in this era as being active in the world; their activity, in fact, is considered to be basic in the world of nature and man. The interpretative sections of this important study may seem to contrast with the objective wealth of its assemblage of material. While the interpretations are inevitably open to be debated, their speculative element is always related to data faithfully observed. J. GWYN GRIFFITHS Katoche, Hierodulie und Adoptionsfreilassung. By I,IENHARD DELEKAT. Miinchener Beitrdge zur Papyrus- forschung und antiken Rechtsgeschichte, 47 Heft. Miinchen: C. H. Beck, I964. Pp. xiv+ 9i. 4 Photo- graphs. No price quoted. The subject of temple-Kaaroxr has attracted considerable attention ever since the first publication of the large collection of Ptolemaic papyri from the Serapeum at Memphis. Delekat was led to examine the problem while preparing a book on Asylie und Schutzorakel am Zionheiligtum. He thus approaches it from a fresh angle and is able to relate it to its Near Eastern background and to compare it with what he be- lieves to have been similar practices in neighbouring lands. Basically the solution he arrives at is that first put forward by von Woess, that the EYKaTroXt were mostly Asylfiichtlinge, but he introduces many new ideas in presenting this view and in developing it further. In his first two chapters Delekat tries to establish that there were three sorts of EyKacroXOL in the Serapeum: those allowed to leave, at any rate temporarily, those confined to the Astartieion, and those who could not leave the temple precincts. The last group, which was probably the largest, consisted of people who had fled to the temple for refuge. As examples Delekat gives Heraclia, the Twins, Taus and Thaues, and (prob- ably) Ptolemaeus, the most famous of the EyKatroxoL. In Chapters III and IV, where Delekat introduces</page></plain_text>
