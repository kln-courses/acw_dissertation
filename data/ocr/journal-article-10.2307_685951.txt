PIKLER I Introduction THE mathematical concept of Utility does not belong in economic doctrine alone; it has deep roots in natural sciences also. Mathe- matically oriented Utility considerations in science were actually developed long before a mathematical theory of Utility had been established in economics. Whenever a behaviouristic model con- struction for physical phenomena seemed adequate, Utility con- siderations were introduced into physical hypotheses. Economic considerations entered especially two chapters in physics: first the theory of equilibrium in classical mechanics, and second the theory of entropy in thermodynamics. As analogues or models for Utility in classical mechanics already had a firm foundation, pioneers of mathe- matical theories of Utility in economics (Walras and Jevons in 1871, Edgeworth in 1881, Pareto in 1896) were noticeably influenced by physical models drawn especially from classical mechanics. Our historical survey will omit pseudo-economic interpretations in physicsl and pseudo-physical interpretations in economics." At various times, interpretations or analogies, which lacked mathematical basis, emerged. Utility theories in physics and mechanical analogies in economics will be of interest only according to their mathematical merits. Therefore, it seems opportune to outline briefly the nmathe- matical attributes of Utility. (I) Utility is a function with several independent variables. Its variations depend upon the allocation of stocks of commodities. (2) Variations of a Utility-function are considered in quantal steps. (3) Measurability of Utility on a numerical scale is not postulated; existence of comparable utility-levels is sufficient criterion. * Received I. xii. 52. 1 Examples : conservation of energy compared to barter ; energy compared to the currency of nature; Carnot's formula explained as tax to be paid to nature etc. 2 Examples : mechanistic theories of the physiocrats in the eighteenth century ; technocracy in our day. 47</page><page sequence="2">ANDREW G. PIKLER ?(4) UTtility-levels can be comprehended in the form of contour- maps of indiference. Each level is characterised by an index. (5) Utilities of commodities are additive. In the simplest hy- pothesis, additivity of Utilities is scalar in nature; in more complex cases, summation of Utilities is subject to vectorial considerations. (6) The Utility-function has a maximum or maxima with regard to given constraints. (7) The entire theory of Utility can, mutatis mutandis, be translated into terms of Disutility. 2 Utility theories in Classical Mechanics The theory of mechanical equilibrium dates back to ancient times. Mathematicians and physicists of antiquity knew and applied com- plicated conditions of equilibrium in numerous hypotheses. However, they did not possess a mathematical tool such as the concept of function and did not have insight into the variations of a function. Only after Descartes introduced functional considerations in natural science could economic reasoning enter the study of mechanical equilibria. Utility considerations in classical mechanics began with the great mathematicians of the eighteenth century who were already adequately prepared to consider mechanical equilibrium problems in terms of variations. The following question, known as the problem of many bodies, was formulated: 'A system subject to an arbitrary set of forces will pass from its initial non-equilibrium position to final equilibrium through a sequence of intermediate states. On the basis of known initial data, can a mathematically perfect description of equilibrium and the sequence of intermediate states be calculated ?' The problem of many bodies represents the fundamental question of dynamics in the eighteenth century. Its relationship to theoretical economics is obvious. Ifa mathematical determination of the problem of many bodies exists, it would universally translate the behaviour of complex systems and offer a model for the solution of complex economic systems also. Two distinct stages in the progress of ideas can be recognised. In the first phase, the Principle of Least Action was developed. The principle of the minimum itself can be traced to Hero of Alexandria (IS5o-IOO .c. ?). In the seventeenth century Fermat established the principle of least time and applied it to propagation of light. The leading mathematicians of the eighteenth century wished to reformulate 48</page><page sequence="3">UTILITY THEORIES this principle in terms of Newtonian mechanics and to generalise it as the fundamental law of nature. They were inspired by a rational consideration. Something which nature wishes to bring to its extreme value, must exist. Thus Maupertuis accepted the principle of least action as a rational postulate and further specified it for the propa- gation of light. In the formulations crystallised by d'Alembert' the law of the minimum appeared in the form of the Principle of Virtual Displacements.2 Every dynamical system is actually con- strained by its internal structural liaisons in its prospective moves. Henceforth, the ensemble of driving forces in a dynamical system could do work only in this pre-set, constrained framework of virtual moves. But will these forces actually work ? By d'Alembert's principle, the driving forces will do work only if in their ensemble they can produce a positive net amount of work.. Conversely, they will do no work if in each of the virtual moves, the summated virtual work is zero. With the aid of this principle, it becomes possible in numerous simple cases to test whether any proposed arbitrary situation does or does not represent an equilibrium. The proposed situation designates an equilibrium if all virtual displacements would lead to zero net amount of work. The test conditions for equilibrium can be written in the form of a system of differential equations to cover virtual work along all co-ordinates. It is understood that d'Alembert's model does not imply the flow of time. The mode of presentation is static and describes merely one position. The Principle of Virtual Displacements has an economic meaning. If formulated in an anthropomorphic manner, as it often was, the principle means: Nature takes no step unless, in terms of her policy behaviour, it is worthwhile for her. The logic of virtual displacements is by no means a specific tool in the theory of mechanical equilibrium. The principle has more general significance; its roots delve into the calculus of variations. In numerous hypotheses pertaining to extreme values the principle appears; a particular value of a function is considered an extreme value if no displacement in the neighbouring region of hyperspace is conceivable. The principle applies also to other types of extreme value specified in calculus. The phenomeno- logical meaning of the Principle of Virtual Displacements is: self- sustaining tendency of the optimum. Leibniz actually built his physics and 1 D'Alembert, Traite' dynamique, 1743 2 Before d'Alembert this principle had been stated by Jean Bernoulli and Leibniz. D 49</page><page sequence="4">ANDREW G. PIKLER metaphysics on the Principle of the Optimum.1 A century after d'Alembert and Leibniz the Principle of Virtual Displacements was rediscovered, from the standpoint of economics, by economist- mathematicians and, also separately, by non-mathematicians, represen- tatives of the Austrian School of marginal-utility doctrine." The second phase of the dynamical doctrine based on least action was inaugurated by Joseph Louis Lagrange in his Me'canique analytique (1788). Lagrange recognised the universal validity of the principle of the minimum and its applicability to any problem in Dynamics. He sought a new model based on a central characteristic function. Is such a central entity derivable which will vary monotonically through a series of intermediate states until equilibrium is reached, and which will attain its extreme value just in the state of final equilibrium of the system ? To follow the variations of such a central and characteristic entity through all intermediate states until equilibrium was reached a new calculus was needed. Lagrange developed the calculus of variations. Without this tool, which was lacking in the dynamics of d'Alembert and Leibniz, only conditions of equilibrium could be stated. Lagrange wished to solve the problem of many moving bodies in the most universal sense, i.e. to determine every displacement of every particle from the initial state of a system to its final equilibrium. He conceived the mathematical model of Field of Force into which he incorporated the Principle of Virtual Displacements and Newton's laws of gravitation. The Field-model was developed by Lagrange in the form of a certain configuration in hyperspace. Lagrange assumed that a centre of forces (e.g. a gravitational centre) assigns certain physical properties to the particular points of the surrounding space. By resorting to a four-dimensional continuum, it would be possible to associate each bundle of space co-ordinates with some kind ofa ' field-characteristic ', namely, in the form of an added fourth co-ordinate. The resulting four-dimensional configuration would then present comprehensive information regarding the physical properties ascribed to space and thus would represent the field of force. Does a similar configuration actually exist ? To build the fourth co-ordinate in connection with gravitation, Lagrange suggested introduction of the entity 'potential' (= work done by the force-centre when bringing a unit mass from 1 Leibniz, Essai de thdodice'e sur la bonti de Dieu, 171o 2 Carl Menger, Grundsatze der Volkswirtschaftslehre, Wien, 1871 (English edition 1934); Friedrich Wieser, Der natiirliche Werth, I889 (English edition 1938). 0So</page><page sequence="5">UTILITY THEORIES an infinite distance to the particular point of space). ' Existence' of the potential field can be best envisaged in the form of its projections from four dimensions to geometrical space. In a similar projection, points in space associated with equal potentials will be arranged in a distinct geometrical order, i.e. in the form of non-intersecting and ordered layers of contour-surfaces. The gradients of the four-dimensional configuration (expressing directions and magnitudes of the maximum change of the potential) can also be projected. Their projections will denote field-intensity (= force exerted on the unit-mass); the ensemble of the projected gradients will delineate a system of lines of force. The Field-model proves as a powerful tool in analytical mechanics for the description of particle-motions subject to a central force. Each change in the position of an ensemble of particles now can be thought of in terms of a corresponding set of paths between initial and terminal points. The central problem of analytical mechanics is calculation of the paths in the reference frame of a potential field. What is actually the course of a single particle from an arbitrary initial point of the field and where will its terminal point be located ? Vector analysis verifies that even in the case of the simplest (' conservative ') types of fields, two additional sources ofvectors, besides the forces of the field, will also intervene. First, the implication of constraints has to be appropriately treated. Namely, generally speaking, a field of force is not expected to operate freely, i.e. in an unobstructed way. A constraint can be formalised in the form of a constraining surface comprehending certain additional bundles of vectors imposed on the affected regions of the field. For the purposes of a unified computation of forces and constraints, Lagrange devised the technique of multi- pliers. Second, vector analysis will have also to include the vectors brought forth by the particle itself, by virtue of its kinetic energy. To treat this particular issue in the reference frame of a field, Lagrange introduced the L-function. On the basis of the above model the behaviour of a particle can be perfectly understood. The actual configurations of all vectors along all the infinitesimal path-elements will account for all kinematic properties of particle-motions. Lagrange derived differential equations for the solution of each separate problem. His fundamental equation formulates the general law of motion which describes the behaviour of a particle in a field of force. Lagrange's second fundamental accomplishment pertains to determination of the static equilibrium of 5'</page><page sequence="6">ANDREW G. PIKLER the particle. Disregarding the particle's own kinetic energy, the forces of the field would impel the particle down to the lowest attainable potential contour compatible with the constraints, viz. along the shortest paths on the surface of constraints. In the point of static equilibrium, by definition, the surface of constraint becomes tangential to a potential surface (see Fig.).

On the mathe- matical side, static equilibrium of a particle is determined by the minimum value of the potential function under the given constraints. Its computation is based on a certain system of differential equations derived from the potential function and supplemented by considera- tions translating the constraints. 52</page><page sequence="7">UTILITY THEORIES Lagrange's final accomplishment pertains to the description of the dynamical behaviour of the particle. It is understood that the particle, owing to its own kinetic energy, will not rest in the point of static equilibrium, but will remain in motion within a certain region of the field. Thus the Lagrangean concept of equilibrium allows, besides static equilibrium, the consideration of dynamical stability. A system is termed stable if constrained to a particular region of the field. The Lagrangean system was further developed by Laplace and applied with success in his Traite' de me'canique cde'leste (I799-1825) to particular problems in celestial mechanics. Lagrange and Laplace represent the eighteenth century's optimistic conception of ideally perfect mechanics. Nature's laws are completely determined. Everything is calculable and predictable; ' savoir c'est prdvoir '. Lagrange's and Laplace's attention was focused on the problems of the gravitational field that concern celestial mechanics. The use of their generalised co-ordinates was further developed by Hamilton in I834. It was understood that the Lagrangean particles do not interact; all particles hitherto were assumed to perform their motions independently. Such idealisation, permissible in celestial mechanics, is obviously unrealistic when describing terrestrial systems. Some further generalisation of the Principle of Least Action was needed to cover not only the motion of single particles but also universal inter- action among particles. According to Hamilton's Principle, the single particle tends to build over its actual path a certain time integral which has a' stationary 'value (in most problems encountered as a minimum) when compared with this time integral over all corresponding' varied' paths. This principle made possible a restatement of the equation of motion in its most general ('canonical') form and explained the behaviour of systems of particles, i.e. any kind of dynamical system involving mechanical forces. Hamilton developed also the new vector calculus needed for treatment of the arising dynamical problems, i.e. the calculus of quaternions. The next step, which was undertaken by Gauss in I839, was to apply the Field-model to electrostatic phenomena. Clausius in 1850 initiated the Field-analogy treatment of thermodynamical processes and formulated the corresponding Field-function in terms of entropy. A new chapter of Field Physics had its start and developed independently along its own ramifications. It is most instructive to realise that comprehensive tables of valid analogies can be established between the key-concepts of the theories of potential and thermodynamical 53</page><page sequence="8">ANDREW G. PIKLER entropy to demonstrate the common origin of the concepts in classical Field Physics. Two further steps helped the progress of Field Physics. To inter- pret the genesis and properties of waves in the Field frame of reference, Maxwell' established the model of electromagnetic Field and stated his field equations in 1873. Practically all known types of physical phenomena were already included in Field-models; however, all these different Fields were formulated separately. The following step in Field Physics already envisaged the coming unification of Fields. A thorough remodelling of the concept of' configuration of co-ordinates' became imperative. From the Principle of Relativity stated by Poincar6 in 1904 and by Einstein in 190o5 it was understood that a substantial part of our experiences both in the sectors of cosmic events and of the atom, are merely relativistic, i.e. dependent on the observer's position. To comprehend similar event-histories, a new type of Field-model had to be devised which covered relativity of time and space. From Lagrange to Maxwell, Field-models included time as a universal and absolute reference-frame of flowing events. In relativistic Fields, time constitutes a fourth co-ordinate associated with each particle to specify its position in the unified space-time continuum. Besides the geometrical properties of the gravitational field, the Newtonian laws of dynamics had also to be appropriately reconsidered to be fitted into the relativistic framework. After incorporating into the Field-model all the necessary 'relativistic corrections' (including equivalence of matter and energy and their joint conservation), Einstein derived the general law of motion in the relativistic field as a new variant of the Principle of Least Action. The world-line, which is the event-history of a particle, follows the shortest possible paths ('geodesics') determined by the curvatures bent upon the continuum by gravitational interaction. Subsequent formulations in relativistic mechanics expressed the Principle of Minimum Action in a new light. Hilbert stated that gravitation brings the total curvature of space-time continuum to a minimum. According to Whittaker gravitation represents a continued effort for the universe to straighten out. The Unified Field Theory suggested by Einstein is destined to represent the final generalisation of the Principle of Minimum with respect to all phenomena, including mechanics and electromagnetism. The essence of Field Theory can be summarised as follows : 1 Maxwell, Electricity and Magnetism, 1873 54</page><page sequence="9">UTILITY THEORIES (x) All event configurations happen in a topologically completely- ordered continuum. (2) The sequence of actual events produces some type of extreme value under the constraint of a certain law of conservation. (3) Dynamic interferences with a system can be described as curvatures bent upon the continuum. 3 Mechanical Analogies in Economics The classical concept of' configuration of co-ordinates' proved a guide in mathematical economics. After Cournot's' initiative (1838) in formulating the equilibrium of a single market, and Gossen's2 incentive (I854) to specify in a geometrical form a single in- dividual's economic behaviour, LtonWalrass was the first (1871) to recognise the feasibility of dynamic economic analysis in general. He attacked dynamic analysis of economic systems at three different levels. The first level implied solution of an individual's budgeting with a given income at a given price-level. This frame of reference merely denoted the solution of a particular type of equilibrium, i.e. partial equilibrium. The Marginal Utility Theorem stated by Walras with the methods of the calculus was only the starting point. Walras was first to introduce the conception of a general economic equilibrium to resolve the global result of the ensemble of partial equilibria. This was his second-level of approach. It was born under the auspices of the eighteenth century's M'canique rationelle. Walras aimed to establish a perfect knowledge of all markets considered simultaneously and formulated the model of Economique rationelle.' Perfect knowledge of all markets could be attained through a system of simultaneous equations representing constraining conditions for a steady state which can be identified as economic equilibrium. The problem of such equilibrium is considered as mathematically solved if the number of available equations equals thenumbers of unknown (the unknowns being the quantities exchanged and their relative prices). This second approach of Walras reflects the Principle of Virtual 1 A. A.

PIKLER Displacements borrowed from d'Alembert's Dynamics, although Walrus did not formalise the analogy as such. The ensemble of forces implied in a dynamical system does not produce work unless they can generate a net amount of work. Now, external economic forces can be identified with causes which modify existing flows of commodities supplied and demanded in the steady state. Without interference of such external causes, flows of goods would remain steady like the flow of a stream. The internal economic forces of supply and demand will become immediately activated if, for any reason, discrepancies between supplies and demands arise. Shifts will then materialise in the sectors both of supply and demand, and the system will attain its new equilibrium position ; supplies and demands become equalised once again. By d'Alembertian logic, economic equilibrium can be identified with a situation in which, under the given constraints of the free competitive econonmic system, no finite shift in any of the sectors of supply and demand can materialise. Walras formalised the constraints in the form of an equation translating the system's virtual variations; in a set of additional equations he comprehended all possible configurations under the driving forces of supply and demand. Finally he showed that in all specified types of general equilibrium models, the number of unknowns is equal to the number of functional liaisons. It is understood, however, that time- flow was not included among the co-ordinates; the Walras- d'Alemrnbertian model is timeless. To the problem of general equilibrium Walras formulated a second solution. He established the concept of a central entity which is expected to reach its maximum in the equilibrium position of the markets. He stated his Theorem of Maximum Satisfaction. Economic1 equilibrium secures the greatest possible satisfaction for society within the limits of constraints imposed on the system by free competition. Walras' system of simultaneous equations, interpreted as the determinant of the extreme value of a central characteristic function, undoubtedly pointed toward the Lagrangean Field Analogy. Field-interpretation of economic equilibrium represents the third level in Walras' dynamic analysis. Does a more specific structural analogy between Lagrange's mechanics and Walrasian economics exist ? The author of this study2 1 Walras, Ele'ments, pp. I33, 286 SA.

I-2 56</page><page sequence="11">UTILITY THEORIES advocated the possibility of such analogy in I932. Luigi Amorosox in 1948 stated the possibility of specifying formal parallelisms between the different groups ofLagrange's and Walras' equations. Analogies are tempting and therefore must be judged with circumspection. In a general and merely formal sense the mathematical analogy is undeniable. In both theories the problems focus on variations of a central characteristic function which are expected to be brought to their extreme value under their respective constraints. A group of liaisons which establish the functional variations of a dynamical system exists in the Lagrangean Field-Theory. Particular equations describe constraints which are manifest in the form of virtual variations. In the state of equilibrium, all functional variations are constrained to the minimum level of potential. Similarly, the Walrasian system implies a group of equations formulating functional economic variations; particular liaisons are stated to specify the virtual variations of the economic system. In the state of equilibrium all functional variations are constrained to the maximum level of'collective satisfaction '. This analogy is confined to static equilibrium. Walras obviously recognised the intricacies involved in a pre- sentation of the Analogy in more specific terms. At first sight, a difficulty appears in the mathematical sector. Lagrange's theory was built on a minimised function, whereas Walras felt bound to formulate a superfunction of the market in terms of an entity to be maximised. Were an inverse approach to be chosen, the entire economic model ought to be recast in terms of an artifact, i.e. the ' function of social disutility'; clarity of the model would be certainly overshadowed. Apart from such formal implications, the meritory aspect had to be really clarified, i.e. the 'existence' of the superfunction in the mathematical sense as an outgrowth of functional economic variations. Hereafter, phenomenological difficulties would accumulate if a speci- fication of the parallelisms concerning the variables were attempted. Namely, in Lagrange's theory 'configuration of co-ordinates' cover spatial distribution of particles; differentials mean infinitesimal displacements in space. In turn, 'configurations of co-ordinates' designate in the Walrasian model quantities of commodities supplied and demanded during a time unit, i.e. commodity flows; differentials represent their increments. Moreover, Lagrange's dynamics deals SLuigi Amoroso, ' Thdoric mathanmatique de l'dquilibre dconomique : Squations gindralcs de la dynamiquc ', Econom'tricaS, I95, 18, 64 57</page><page sequence="12">ANDREW G. PIKLER with allocation of particles in three dimensional Euclidean space, whereas no geometrical space in the Walras model is involved.l Also time was treated in a different manner in the two models. In ILagrange's dynamics, time was included in the formulation of con- straints; the kind of time implied was Newtonian, i.e. a general reference-frame of flow of events, universal in its validity and in- dependent from the observer's position. None of Walras' three models included the issue of time-flow among the co-ordinates; therefore no analogue to Langrange's equation of motion to specify temporal history of configurations could be obtained. Moreover, all Field-characteristics in Mecanique rationelle were drawn from issues in Newtonian physics (force, work, etc.). Field-characteristics in Aconomique rationelle must be based on specific implications of human desires and social constraints. Without even envisaging the possibility of analogies, the field- formulation was used by Walras with extreme caution. The Theorem of Collective Satisfaction was stated only as a corollary. Because of possible considerations regarding the concept of collective satisfaction and its measurability, Walras refrained from building his theories on a foundation of a Field-analogue kind. His conception, which was primarily based on causation through sets of forces rather than on the collective behaviour of the system, pointed toward the pre-Lagrangean approach in dynamics. The first two levels in his dynamic analysis, i.e. the solution of individual budgets and of general equilibrium by means of systems of equations, reflect a d'Alembertian approach. A nucleus of the Walras-Lagrangean analogy can also be traced. (To be concluded) 1 The ensemble of all markets may be thought of as a 'configurational economic space' which encompasses the aggregates of k different types of com- mnodities distributed among n individuals, i.e. a grand total of n x k 'commodity- stacks '. 58</page></plain_text>
