<plain_text><page sequence="1">BHÜ-VARÄHA SCULPTURES ( Indian art vis-a-vis the iconographie prescriptions ) By R. NATH The iconographie prescriptions of Indian sculpture laid down rules, in accordance with the respective mythologies, for carving images of gods and goddesses; they are injunctions of religious implication, prescribing their figures and postures along with the weapons ( ãyudha ) and ornaments (äbhüsana).1 Iconometry laid down the Tãlamãna or proportionate measurements in two dimensions, i. e. length and breadth. Various Šilpa- Šástras dealt with the subject with elaborate details. Images carved without observing these rules were deemed to be inauspicious, and, in accordance with the concept of Indian art as Bhadrakrta ( = auspicious ), such images were prohibited. These rules, certainly, prescribed the figure and its broad outlines, and sometimes the posture too, with weapons and ornaments, denoting a certain mythological reference and assigning the respective god or goddess its place in the hierarchy, each one representing and symbolising in essence an anthropomorphic form of a concept or doctrine. But, for all that matter, these rules were general guidelines for the sculptor - by way of distinguishing features - and were not rigid formulae of art. The Indians never imitated nature and never produced anatomical replicas ; their approach to art was idealistic. Nor did they confine their art to a rigid and mechanical adherence to a code of prescriptions based on myths and beliefs of their religion. The Hindu sculptor was moved by a subtle aesthetic feeling on the contemplative side and was guided in execution by his intuition. His work is tremendously subjective, inasmuch as it is the total sum of his contemplation. Thus the Šukra-Nlti-Sára of Šukrácarya enjoined that the artist would make use of the visual-formulae ( dhyãna ) proper to the god whose image is to be made before actually beginning the work. " It is for the successful accomplish- 1 . These iconographie injunctions applied only to the images and sculptures of gods and goddesses; ornamental sculptures, e. g. dancing, and sporting female figures, nymphs, dryads, chauri-bearers and sura-sundaris , which may be classed for convenience as non- sectarian, were carvcd without such injunctions at the discreticn of the sculptor as guided by his intuition and training, like other ornaments of the Hindu temple as k'rtimukha , vyãla figures, sãrdãla, Tchi ( wave or rhythm ), asta -mari galas ( eight auspicious symbols ), gapas (grotesque human forms), and mithunas (erotics).</page><page sequence="2">800 ABORI : Diamond Jubilee Volume ment of this practice ( yoga ) of visual-formulation ( dhyãna ) that the linea- ments ( laksana ) of images are prescribed."2 It is through visual contem- plation, and not through direct observation, that the sculptor can achieve his objective. The likeness to natural phenomenon is of no merit and the insistence is on visualization and ideal proportions. We know for certain that Iconography did not prescribe the depth of sculpture in the third dimension and there was enough liberty of action to the sculptor. More important is the fact that in spite of vague iconographie suggestions about the bhãva of the respective sculpture, the sculptor was almost free to bring about an expression, in other words, its total effect - as best as he could work it out and in this sphere his chisel was not restrained by any rule and he could exercise his intuition to the best of his skill. Sculptural aestheticism in India was simply outlined by the prescribed icon, it was essentially the result of the artist's genius and training. The point may be examined with reference to the depiction of Bhu- varãha incarnation of Visnu, which has been iconographically prescribed in detail and sculptures of which are also extensively available. Earliest references to the rescue of Earth by Visnu in boar form occur in the Šata- patha-Brãhmana and the Taittiriya-Äranyaka.3 Paurãnic literature abounds with its details. The mythology reads that God Visnu took the form of Varãha in order to save Vasundharã (earth goddess) from the demon Hiranyãksa. In essence, it signifies that the earth was submerged in water and there was threat of total extinction to life. Visnu at this crucial moment came to her relief. In the form of boar he dived deep into water, slew the demon, and rescued her. This was the established version of the mythology in the Gupta age, as is mentioned by the Agni-Purãna : WfSf qPWRHH I I I fèfà II ST^JrT HR 3 &lt;*&gt;«¿&lt;1)4. II (4.1-2) This is also testified by the Toramana inscription of Eran dated c. 484 A. D., e. g. 2. IV. 4. 70-74, Cf. A. K. Coomaraswamy, The Transformation of Nature in Art (Dover ed.), pp. 113-17. 3. Reference may be made, for details, to T. A. Gopinatha Rao? Elements of Hindu tonography, Vol. I, Part I ( 1971 ), pp. 128-33,</page><page sequence="3">NATII : Bhü-varäha Sculptures 801 • • • ( Hail, God Visnu in the form of Varãha who rescued the earth from the depths of sea, who set the mountains shivering and who is the sustaining pillar of this Universe ). The significant feature of this mythology is that, though it is based on an ancient thought, its symbolism as such belongs, root and soul, to the Gupta age which is noted for the revival of Brahmanism. Hence its profuse details in the Paurãnic literature, and its popular depiction in the art of this period. The iconography of this Cosmic event ordained the depiction of Bhu-varãha, also known as Ädi-varäha and Nr-varãha, the most important conceptional type of the avatãra, the other two being Yajna-varãha and Pralaya-varãha, with face of boar and human body in a standing posture, with four arms, with the customary weapons and ornaments of Visnu, the face being tilted so as to touch the bosom of the earth-goddess who is also shown in human form, mostly gracefully standing on the elbow of the boar near his tusks looking at him joyously at her deliverance. The Tãlamãna laid down various proportionate measurements. Thus the Visnu-Purãna gives details of the Bhu-varãha figure which is in the standing posture having four arms, two holding iamkha and cakra (weapons of Visnu); left leg being erect, right leg slightly bent resting upon the jewelled hood of the mythical Ädisesa; one left hand supporting the legs of Bhùmidevî and a right hand thrown round her waist.5 The Agni-Purãna gives the pratimã-laksana of Bhü-varäha as follows TTÜft I WP STÍ qifàr 3T II g i ( 49. 2-3 ) The Visnudharmottara-Purãna furnishes greater details of the avatãra and, surprisingly, it also touches the expressionistic aspect of the figure : ^TftsW sng: I 4.

The Vaikhãnasa-ãgama, the Aparãjitaprcchã, and the Šilpa-rainam, with minor difference of details, concur as to the icon of the Bhü-varäha. The 15th century work Rüpa-mandana is very precise in this respect and simply observes i -Troff i Črm. TOfTOt I w w II ( III. 24 ) ( Matsya and Kurma avatãras are shown in their respective forms. Varãha is in human form, only its head is that of a boar. It holds gadã ( mace ) and padma ( lotus ) and is of black complexion. It bears Prthvî at the front portion of its tusks ). Bhü-varäha sculptures are extensively available in India and a few representative examples may be examined in this context. The Udaigiri Varãha is the earliest. It is carved in bold relief, almost round, in rock in Cave No. 5. It belongs to the reign of Candragupta II Vikramäditya in the early 5th century A. D., i. e. in the prime of the Gupta age. Except that the Bhü-varäha has two arms instead of four, it closely corresponds to the prescribed icon. It appears that the concept of a four-armed varãha as an incarnation of the four-armed Visnu was a later development, or at least this had not come into vogue at the time when the Udaigiri Varãha was carved. As all iconographie prescriptions are later, it is possible that the icon was prescribed with the help of such prominent examples and the case was not vice versa. A more important aspect of the Varãha of Udaigiri, however, is the excellence of its execution and its total effect. The god stands to about 12 6, Cf. D. N. Shukla, Vlstu-Š astra, Vol. II, p. 90 ( Text ).</page><page sequence="5">NATII : Bhü-varäha Sculptures 803 feet ( 3. 66 metres ) height and is almost in round relief ( Plate-I ). Left foot of its human figure treads upon the kuttdala of Šesa, while the right leg is powerfully posed. Its left arm rests on the left knee and the right on the waist in an extremely assertive posture. The huge vaijayanti hangs below the knees and constitutes the chief ornament. The representation, i. e the total sum of figure, posture, and the deep relief, is vibrant with force and vigour, and at once gives an expression of confidence and assertiveness - to carry out the Cosmic mission of rescuing the earth from out of the deep waters. In comparison to this dreadful incarnation, the feminine form of Pfthvï standing on the tusks ( dantakoti ) of the Varäha has been carved delicately and slenderly in an extremely graceful posture. Though its head is damaged it is without doubt a beautiful sculpture. The idea of Prthvi looking with surprise and pleasure ( ãkaryotphullanayanã ) at her deliverance has been effectively conveyed. Every inch of it pulsates with life and the stone sculpture faithfully represents the underlying bhãvá. The symbolism has been variously interpreted. It has been suggested, for example, that Candragupta II subdued the Saka ruler and rescued Dhruvasvâminï, queen of his elder brother Rãmagupta who had surrendered her to the former; the Varäha represents the rescuer Candragupta and Prthvi Dhruvasvâminï. The Dhruvasvâminï episode may or may not have a bearing on its symbolism but it is certain that Candragupta II cleared the country of the Šaka usurpers and brought the region under his sway. Hence the occasion and site of its depiction. The adjoining Cave No. 6 at Udaigiri bears an inscription of Candragupta II dated in the year 82 of the Gupta era being equivalent to 401-2 A. D.7 Cave No. 7 also bears an inscription of Candragupta II. It contains such valuable references as : tawto ^T^F^čTTTÍ^(^T) (who acquired this earth by his might and prowess ) and : ( who came here while performing Digvijaya of the earth ).8 It thus seems certain that the reference is to Cardragupta's conquest of the earth, i. e. digvijaya. All these three caves (Nos. 5, 6 and 7) are contemporary and the Varäha sculpture also symbolises his digvijaya and Prthvi's deliverance at his hands. 7.

D.*, alludes to the same symbolism in the bharata-vãkya of his famous play Mudrãrãksasa, which, though it relates to the Maurya Candragupta ( c. 320 B. C. ), reminds one of Candragupta II Vikramãditya ( c. 400 A. D. ). It states : ■=1 Í^AHR-hčíi trfèfa I * ïïfr qïf%^55fr: Il 10 ( God Visnu, in boar form, recued the earth submerged in pralaya and she took shelter on his tusks. Likewise Candragupta has rescued this earth from MIecchas and she has taken shelter on his two arms. May he rale for ever on earth). The occurrence of the word pãrthiva in the bharata-vãkya of Mudrãrãksasa and in the inscription of Cave No. 7 of Udaigiri is noteworthy. Of greater importance, however, is the reference in the bharata-vãkya of two arms ( bhujayugam ) of the Saviour. It shows that the four-armed icon had not been laid down either when the Udaigiri sculpture was carved or when the Mudrãrãksasa was composed and the four-armed Varãha is a later concept. This is confirmed by the free-standing Varãha sculpture from Eran ( Sagar, M. P. ) which too is a masterpiece ( Plate-II ). It is also two-armed and possesses the same vigour which is reflected at Udaigiri. Abundance of flesh has, however, restricted the sphere of its graceful effect - particularly its Prthvi does not stand comparison to her Udaigiri counterpart. Nonetheless, its total effect is as powerful and assertive as it is perceived at Udaigiri. It seems that this symbolism was greatly in vogue in the Madhya-desh during the Gupta period. It was an age of revival and renaissance, and every ruler claimed to have liberated the earth from foreign usurpers in his own way and professed to have imitated God Visnu in his incarnation of Varãha. Pratihãra King Bhoja, who humbled the Rästrakütas, pushed them back into the Deccan, and liberated a large tract of this region, designated himself4 Ädi-varäha' in the Gwalior prosasti of 875-76 A. D. in imitation of the same mythological reference.11 He used this biruda 'Ädi-varäha' 9. This is controversial. A.B. Keith ( Sanskrit Nàtaka , tr. U. B. Singh, Delhi, 1971, p. 212 ) places him in the 8th century A. D. A. A. Macdonell ( A History of Sanskrit Litera- ture, Delhi, 1971, p. 309) concurs. But Bachaspati Gairola ( Sanskrit Sãhitya kä samksipta Itihâsa , Varanasi, 1967, pp. 577-83 ), after examining all the available theories, places him in the 5th century A. D. This seems to be nearer to the truth. 10. Mudrãrãksasa of Visãkhadatta, ( ed. J. G. Misra ) ( Varanasi, 1972 ), p. 482. 11.

' Srimad-ãdivarãha 'u The obverse side of these coins bears the figure of Varãha incarnation of Visnu.18 It is important to note that he even had an enormous sculpture of Bhü-varäha carved on the face of the rock inside the Laksmana gate of the Gwalior Fort, close to his rock-cut temple of Visnu as Vailiabhattasvãmin.14 It is strange that the later images of the god are in no way superior to the Udaigiri Varãha; on the contrary, in many respects they are inferior. The^arãha from Kutari ( Allahabad ) dated c. 5th century A. D., now in the Allahabad Museum15, holds Prthvi awkwardly by her hip and is effectless ( Plate-Ill ). Examples from south Indian temples also do not show any betterment. The sculptures from Aihole ( Ravana-Phadi and Durgä Temple)16 ( c. 7th century A. D. ) ( Plates IV and VII respectively) are weak and lack that effect of force and assertion which is characteristic of the Udaigiri image. Likewise the Varãha sculptures from Badami Caves No. 2 and 3 ( dated 578 A. D. ) ( Plates V and VI ) and Ellora Cave No. 11 ( c. 7th century A. D. )17 lack effect and appear to be stereotyped compositions rather than lively works of art. There are several Varãha sculptures, inde- pendent as well as forming part of the Dasã va tãra panels from Badoh, Suhania and other sites of Madhya Pradesh, now in the Gujari-Mahal Museum of Gwalior, belonging to the period from 9th to 12th century A. D. But they are disproportionate and ineffective. The Varãha in each case lacks that force and assertion and the Prthvi that grace and beauty which are the characteristic features of the Udaigiri composition. The Varãha from Nachna-Kuthara (Panna) (Plate-VIII) and the one from Allahabad (Plate-IX), both dated c. 10th century A. D., now in the Allahabad Museum, are dull and do not impress. It is surprising that, while the non-religious sculptures of Khajuraho are marvels of the art of sculpture and excel any other examples of their class on earth, its Varãha images now preserved in the Allahabad Museum and the Khajuraho Museum ( See Plate-X for example ) are effectless and appear to be msrely mechanical replicas. *In all respects the Udaigiri Varãha and, to a slightly lesser degree, the Eran Varãha, both 12.

This was mutilated a number of times according to the faith of the possessor of the Fort and now exists in an extremely defaced condition.

D., are the best examples of the depiction of this symbolism. It may by easily realised that the excellence of execution and grace of effect did not lie in rigid adherence to Sãstric prescriptions. The figuře, based on mythology, and, sometimes, the posture were prescribed, but the depth - in the third dimension - was not laid down. Depth and propor- tions were the determining factors of graceful effect of a sculpture and it was the sphere of the artist's discretion. The carver, who could play with stone in accordance with his visual formulation and skill, could work wonders and bring about a beautiful effect without violating the Sãstric zone. His inspiration which preceded his visual formulation was also a decisive factor. His freedom lay not only in the formulation of the lineaments of the figure, like the painter, but also in the treatment of the mass of stone in the third dimension, and it is in the manipulation of the mass of stone in the third deminsion - of course within the prescribed outlines - and the sacred inspira- tion which moved him to work - that the secret of Indian sculpture is to be discovered. Without doubt, the sculptor of Udaigiri worked out his ideals more ably, successfully, and effectively than the artist of the 11th century as far as the images or religious sculptures are concerned.18 Firstly, it is because of the Great Age which produced the Varãha of Udaigiri ; secondly, because of the incident of the emancipation of the land from invaders and the deep touch of feeling it bestowed upon the art; and thirdly, because of the regional heritage which, in Madhya Desh, is exceptionally rich in stone art. The folfowing plates have been reproduced by courtesy of the American Institute of Indian Studies, Varanasi. 18. The secular sculptures of the 11th century reflect as great an art as those of the 5th century, though this is beyond the purview of the present study.</page><page sequence="9">6 £ v a s s S,®.
