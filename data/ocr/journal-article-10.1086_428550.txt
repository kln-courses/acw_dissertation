      <p>The 1860s witnessed a heated debate between liberal theologians and their “positivist” opponents about the correct baptismal rite in the Reformed Church in Zurich. Connecting historical theology with ritual theory, Theodore M. Vial’s well‐written and stimulating book analyzes this liturgy war, which ended, in 1868, with a stalemate: the adoption of two baptismal rites.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the work of the Swiss theologian Alois Biederman, Vial’s historical analysis shows how Young Hegelian theology relates to the sociopolitical dynamics in rapidly modernizing Zurich. More precisely, the book argues that Biederman’s theology is part of a sociopolitical context that assumes a dynamic view of history and a strictly immanent view of historical agency. Enlightenment ideas about the moral foundations of democratic sovereignty and the changes in production processes both “regenerated” the structures of city and county government and formed a historical philosophy that sees humanity as the sole locus of change, agency, and (theologically speaking) redemption.</p>
      <p>In Vial’s analysis, Biederman stands between David F. Strauss and the politically conservative Old Hegelians, whose christology Biederman accuses of supernaturalism. For Biederman redemption is achieved historically through an act that all human beings can perform in principle. Thus, Jesus cannot be the unique “expression of God’s personality” (p. 69). In distinction to Strauss, Biederman retains the idea that Jesus introduces and makes accessible an absolute religious consciousness of the union of divine and human. Vial notes that this stance violates Biederman’s own methodology. Yet he concludes, “For Biederman the historically significant action of Jesus was the founding of the community through the force of his religious self‐consciousness. By joining this community one can encounter his religious self‐consciousness in any age” (p. 68). Vial contrasts this idea with Philipp K. Marheineke’s conservative contention that humanity’s development is completed in Jesus’ unique perfection. Vial argues that this violates the modern sense of historical agency. Biederman’s historical philosophy “locates the power to act … immanently across the entire human community.” Marheineke, on the other hand, locates historical agency primarily in individuals acting “by virtue of their special characteristics” (p. 72). This location is not only theologically contradictory; it also contravenes the political reforms of the liberal Zurich government. Understanding the differences between conservative and Young‐Hegelian christologies in terms of historical agency allows Vial to account for the battle over the baptismal ritual in Zurich. In particular, Vial aims to show why the liberals refused to address Christ directly or use the Apostles' Creed, while Biederman used such addresses in his sermons.</p>
      <p>In the second part of his book, Vial reads the two conflicting baptismal rituals using a combination of John Searle’s speech‐act theory and Robert McCauley’s and Thomas Lawson’s ritual competence theory. He finds that the liberal ceremony reflects an immanent historical agency in line with both the vision of history underlying the liberal “regeneration” government and Young Hegelian theology. The heart of the matter is whether and how Jesus can be considered an agent in history. The liberal rite must assume an understanding of Jesus’ agency that is strictly human and avoid talking about the God‐man of the Apostles' Creed or making requests of “someone who is dead” (p. 106).</p>
      <p>Why, then, could Biederman condone addresses to Jesus in his sermons? Vial argues, “While representational (or anthropomorphic) language serves legitimate perlocutionary ends, to insert such language at a point where the structure of the ritual demands descriptive (or factual) utterances threatens to invalidate the ritual” (p. 106). Vial places Biederman’s theology within its broader context and convincingly shows how theological and ritual changes are intertwined with political battles. His use of Searle allows us to see how words can do different things in ritual texts. In terms of general ritual theory, Vial reflects on the intentionality of ritual actors, critiquing Catherine Bell, for example, for disjoining ritual action from intent (p. 81). “Because theology is a component of the religious conceptual scheme of ritual participants, the lexicon of legitimate agents, actions, objects, and properties, such a radical shift in Christology [as evidenced in the theological debates surrounding Biederman] must effect a change in ritual” (p. 107).</p>
      <p>In Michel de Certeau’s words, we do not know, however, what the conceptual scheme of the actual consumers of the ritual are. In contrast to the strategies of those controlling the production of signification (theologians and politicians), the consumers of those strategies create a patchwork of desires and intentions that are “neither determined nor captured by the systems in which they develop” (<italic>Practice of Everyday Life</italic> [Berkeley, 1984]).</p>
      <p>Thus, I wonder how the intentional world of ritual agents can be analyzed prior to ritual performances and in textual terms (thereby equating intentionality of an act with semantics). Vial’s book presses an important point of discussion between those scholars who emphasize practice and those who search for a cognitive theory of ritual.</p>
