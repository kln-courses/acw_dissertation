Doing Science offers 35 laboratory experiments in ten subject areas that correlate with all major elemen- tary science textbooks. They come packaged in two program kits: "Physical Science" and "Natural Science!' Each is a complete teaching unit that lets youngsters work at their own speed, repeating an experi- ment until they fully grasp the concept. Each kit contains filmstrips, tape cassettes, labora- tory materials, Teacher's Guides and Laboratory Assistants' Guides. Children work on their own, performing simple experi- ments according to audio-cassette and filmstrip instructions.
