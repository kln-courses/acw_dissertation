AT THE EDGE by Michael Goldman. The Macmillan Com- pany, $4.95. ODES by Paul Carroll Big Table, $4.95. THESE FOUR VOLUMES REPRESENT A WIDE RANCE OF THE CURRENT- ly available styles in poetry. They happen to make a scale, from the deliberately traditional rhyme, meter and wit of X. J. Ken- nedy, through the greater variety but still traditional bent of Julia Randall, to the more open yet well-made work of Michael Goldman, and finally the sprawling inclusiveness of Paul CarrolL But one thing all four poets have in common: all are academy trained, at least through the master's degree. The first three are college professors, and Paul Carroll has been a college teacher as well as an editor and a publisher. The academy has absorbed most of the variety there is. Allen Ginsberg's remark in the anthology Naked Poetry, "The old library poets had lost their voices; natural voice was rediscovered," summarized a change that later took place inside the academy as welL Even X. J. Kennedy's poetry depends on the colloquial voice-to balance its fonnal surface. Here is an example of his characteristic ingenuity, from "Nothing in Heaven Functions as It Ought": But Hell, sleek Hell hath no freewheeling part: None takes his own sweet time, none quickens pace. Ask anyone, How come you here, poor heart?- And he will slot a quarter through his face, You'll hear an instant click, a tear will start Imprinted with an abstract of his case. There is a reflexive movement between the image of the clownish mechanical monster and the tone of colloquial tendemess in the line, "Ask anyone, How come you here, poor heart?" Kennedy</page><page sequence="2">144 REVIEWS is deft at releasing the energy of ordinary speech in the field of his outlandish imagination. His strength is a witty candor; his weakness, a merely fancy, uncandid wit. Sometimes a sort of neo-metaphysical gusto ani- mates his lines, as in "Birth Report": "When blam! my father's gun began the dash / Of fifty thousand tadpoles for one egg. . . ." But in "Scholar's Wife," for example, the whole figure seems contrived: All winter long, your book The Doric Mood Advanced while I lay sleeping in the nude Or reading, sucking caramels, on my back. I'd hear downstairs your typewriter attack The barricades of learning till, the skin Of suburbs pierced, your column spurted in, Shivering, I'd draw the bedclothes tight against my chin. Better, lighter, luckier, more a product of chance and para- doxically defter, is the little poem called "Lazy Plumbing": Letting the water run to get it hot, I lay back down on my cot And so did you. A bobolink Complained of the loss of water in the sink. Morning grew hot. Our coffeepot scorched through. And sometimes the capacity for surprising combinations reaches beyond comic surprise and touches awe, as in "Creation Mom- ing": Who would not start growth rings Breaking on shores of bark At the toss of a seed like a stone.... But the volume as a whole, despite its abundant playful energy, seems willful, cerebral, planned. Something is missing, something has been betrayed. What is missing can be explained by an observation of Iris</page><page sequence="3">PHILIP COOPER 145 Murdoch's: "Our sense of form," she writes, "which is an aspect of our desire for consolation, can be a danger to our sense of reality as a rich receding background." The desire to see around the dark comer can make the verse too neat. Julia Randall, however, despite her bent for tradition, including the consolations of religion, manages not to diminish the mystery of the world, but works to make it new. She is capable of the great religious lyric, in the tradition of George Herbert, brought home into her own time and place. Witness "Tallis' Canon." The dawn wind smelling of smoke from the smouldering trash gulley breathes me awake. I can imagine the lake rippling its dark taut silk a moment, and the breeze like a cloud-shadow moving to pick up its invisible particles of smoke. Dawn-wind, pick up my prayer coming awake from the dangerous dark bloodside of the world, and soon with the sun in the still unseen regular dawn forgotten: to feel the day flow into my limbs, coming back from sleep, or going away into love. Lord, that I am a moment of your turnings. The "Awake, my soul," that opens the hymnal (as the lyric "Talls' Canon" opens the volume Adam's Dream), a Liatin maxim that creation is smoke (nil nisi divinum stabile est; caetera fumus-which T. S. Eliot quotes in the epigraph to "Bur- bank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar"), the cycles im- plicit in trash, and in the purifications of buming, the cyclic re- tum of water like smoke into the air, the cycles of the musical round or canon, and of the blood, and of day after night and waking after sleep or love: the phenomena of books combine with the phenomena of unmade things into a sense of the whole</page><page sequence="4">146 REVIEWS -evidence of what Auden has surmised to be "a retum, in a more sophisticated form, to a belief in the phenomenal world as a realm of sacred analogies." Julia Randall, who loves the grand manner, the great voices of literature, can come down off those stilts like Crazy Jane. Or like some Joan of Arc, she can hold converse with the ghostly voices of Yeats, Blake, Rilke, Keats-fiercely, like an Old Testa- ment prophet, certain of her calling to speak among them. Here is a poem, "The Voices," about her calling. Two voices contend. One is an egotistical, individuating, ultimately (for her) false voice, and the other is the voice of her poetic character-the selfless "camelion Poet," in Keats's phrase. I remember the god in the green stone, But took another for my own. He sang and sang Of brother-beasts and straw-eyed children, Winter flights, trade-learning, Slimfire meals, ghost flurries, My life long He sang: it was my song. I remember the day my voice broke. Something died in the wind, in the oak. My brother and I Gazed deadly. Savage summer stilled, Ocean unhilled, And toadmouths clacked for bread in the straw chantry. I do not remember now how lungs breathed rock, Or piped up ghostly preludes to the tongue Of the new journeyman. The small god with no name But olive, iron, But summer passing, Cricket, worm- He sings up, love, from all the stones of time. That is the way the last line was originally punctuated: as in a love poem. In Adam's Dream the commas are deleted, stressing the transpersonal instead of the individual. But both are present, by ambivalence, in either version; and this ambiva- lence, in which private love, public religion, and professional vo- cation are conflated, is enabled by the resistant mystery of her</page><page sequence="5">PHILIP COOPER 147 song-its charming darkness, or openness-a sort of multiple perspective into the "rich, receding background," the sacred continuity of things. "The small god with no name / But olive, iron, / But summer passing," like the things named in Rilke's Ninth Elegy-like the things Adam named-"sings up love from all the stones of time" to be transforrned into her, to live in her voice. Among those things are the voices of the old library poets. To Emily Dickinson she writes, in "Derivative": I know a few things by heart: carpel from corm, how crocus grow, how blue is shut in the jay's egg, how my separate songs are yours also. She has a gift for formal song that can consort with Yeats's. Here is the third of her "Five Pieces for Dancing Perhaps": To dance, at last to dance, to print the sand and every element. To hang the stars upon your wrists, tq touch you, and to name the beasts. The formal song, the personal touch, blend as one. And, in "Sab- batical," she can bring her dark light home into the closet dust, into the perfectly conversational tone: I don't think it was failure or laziness always to repeat the same sonata, always to stare at the same mess in the closet. The dust has a business which the dust doesn't know. I will never (the dust tells me) play the piano. I will never write the article on Tennyson. I will never have children. I will never go to Greece. I will never see my mother again, or Brownie. The open, irregular form, with its humble, ghostly, accidental rhymes, is an outward sign of the faith in chance, in the mystery of things-the faith, as she says it in another poem, to "forget the headlong light, and see." The consolations of traditional form, like those of religion, may belong to the headlong light and have to be subdued, to make them new. Enigmatic darkness, or something like a new animi8m, moves</page><page sequence="6">148 REVIEWS through the work of Michael Goldman and rejuvenates Williams' principle of "no ideas but in things." The minimal statement of "Very Slowly" makes a clear example: This boat is going somewhere. The surface is oil-green. The wind is from my left, very light, but the boat goes ahead. Late sun, pollen on the water, a leaf eases past me. The water must be flowing out. This tree tore loose last night; its head is down in the water. The leafy branches arch like a swimmer's arms and go under. Now I am in with the rocks the flooded lake has half-covered. I take up my paddle and slow down. Backwater, backwater, I make her turn; we have stopped behind the floating trunk. A turtle gazes stupidly ahead. Out in the middle of the lake something jumps. There is no other comment than the anthropomorphic image of the tree, to center the strange excitement underlying the calm of the scene. The calm of the scene and the poem's calm are the same thing; in that calm, the imagination moves-with the water, with the fish-and in that movement the people and the stones are one. It is over the edges of the categories that separate things, or people and things, that perception occurs. The edges are like the doors of perception whose cleansing, Blake said, would reveal the infinite. The cleansing is a sort of suspension of ordinary logic-a heightened state of awareness, as when we say "the nerves are on edge," or perhaps look over the edge of a cliff-in whatever sense. The title of the volume, At the Edge, refers to such a threshold of experience. Here is a poem specifically about it: The brush comes up to us; we hear everything that moves.</page><page sequence="7">PHILIP COOPER 149 Under the shiny bushes- dry leaves. A bird is scratching through it like wolves. All over the hot sky there are cries and calls like calligraphy, like little worms; it is a scratchiness, a dryness we could drink like juice in the wires, switches we brush in our mouths when we taste wine. A frightened snake dives for his rock; in this house, in the woods, there is a chance of fire, a liquid, an edge like a nerve buried for miles. With his startling collocations, Michael Goldman is capable of extraordinary compression. His four-line poem "In the Woods" is an extreme but revealing example: "I grew like hair to your clothes." In the woods, red ivy marked the way. The ants streamed with nervous terror. My hand fled over her breasts like a vine. Once again Williams' project comes to mind: "through metaphor to reconcile / the people and the stones." The ambivalence of the first line, the enigma of its quotation, is just unsettling enough to jar the mind loose from conventional categories. The people and the things-hair, clothes, woods, paths, ants, hand, breasts and vine combine as male and female do, or as I and thou, or personal or transpersonal in the unified field of translogical excitation. Erotic energy becomes an animistic force-or per- haps it is the other way around. Either way the poem enters the world's mystery. Michael Goldman's poems are mostly small and well-made,</page><page sequence="8">150 REVIEWS achieving their openness by sudden dislocations of logic. Paul Carroll's "odes" deliberately sprawl beyond the limits of neat form, but their lack of economy brings diminishing returns, a diminished sense of the mystery of the world. Although evi- dently exhilarated by Allen Ginsberg, Tom Wolfe, and the changing scene, he has brought no gift of wit or song or insight to the party. The poems in Paul Carroll's little volume were written over a period of sixteen years. They include lines like these: We are going to drown like flies in the glue of God We are going to try on Claes Oldenburg's "Big Blue Pants" for size from "Where Do We Come From? Who Are We? Where Are We Going?" The one before that is called "Ode to Fellini on Inter- viewing Actors for a Forthcoming Film." It concludes: . . . The angels are ecstatic fish. Or helicopters. And you, Fellini, are a deep-sea diver, searching for the sex of God. Good luck. And the one before that is headed: "This Ode (on Penworth Neat-Erase Bonded Opaque 25% Cotton Fiber USA Paper) Contains 600 Happy (Remington Rand Noiseless Portable) Words for Claes Oldenburg on His Visit to Chicago in the Snows of 1963." It opens: Among the elegant yellow Shell gaspumps, the conservative Kotex pads used by Chicago's Muses of the Arts, the iceboxes opening and clicking shut with their muscular bare arms, the balloons of talk on Kup's Show and the PARK sign at the comer of Madison and State with its winking arrows zigzagging after one another like Powattomie upon a neon trail: you stride, Claes, in size 13 Florsheim shoes. Another, called "Ode to Sevem Darden About Angels, the Common Cold, Nuclear Disarmament, and Popcorn," is printed on a five-foot foldout. It opens:</page><page sequence="9">PHILIP COOPER 151 The weather today, Severn, is as blue as the cerulean blue of the lovely artificial blue of the plastic tulips in the window of the Woolworth 5 &amp; 10c It is like the mackerel which you bought at Burhop's and swaddled in a newspaper and forgot beneath the couch of sorrows in the office of your psychoanalyst Or like the odor of a 1937 Shirley Temple doll Or like a Goodyear tire about to have a flat Or like the fact that everybody is a poem. It is awkward to judge this by any standards that apply to the other three volumes under review. It derives from the work of Allen Ginsberg, chiefly, whatever method it has; but when Allen Ginsberg says all things are holy his voice is true. When Paul Carroll repeats it, it sounds like an echo. Mr. Car- roll's interviews with Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer, which he conducted for Playboy magazine, are superb. The Young American Poets, an anthology which he edited and published, like Odes, in his series of Big Table Books, is lively and fresh. But his verse can be banal: A poem can be the melancholy hard-on of an angel. It is often too stridently with-it. It needs to "forget the headlong light, and see." When it should be quiet, it is busy dropping names. What looks like open form in it is not. How- ever, this is only Carroll's first book of poems; it is Kennedy and Goldman's second and Randall's fourth. Taken all together, the four poets make a lively balance of tradition and expen- ment; but the two means greatly outweigh the extremes. Vb</page></plain_text>
