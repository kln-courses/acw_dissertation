<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rivka Horwitz FROM HEGELIANISM TO A REVOLUTIONARY UNDERSTANDING OF JUDAISM: FRANZ ROSENZWEIG'S ATTITUDE TOWARD KABBALA AND MYTH The beginning of the twentieth century was a continuation of the Age of Reason, and Franz Rosenzweig was part of this trend as he wrote his dissertation Hegel und der Staat. But not much later he reacted against the "possibility of the cognition of the All" by joining a new direction. He reacted against the proud rational philosophy and par- ticularly against the philosophy of Hegel. Rosenzweig sought for sup- port in the works of anti-idealists such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to reject that trend. He demanded the breaking of the All into three elements-God, man, and the world-and demanded a humility that not "all" can be known. At the very bottom of his philosophy myth appears in the form of paganism, not as the bugbear to terrorize but as the truth itself reduced to its elements. He then unified the three elements, present- ing them in the biblical mythical dimension in the form of creation, revelation, and redemption. That "new thinking" enabled him to present the dialogue between God and the human being and between one human being and the other. In the dialogue love is the central ele- ment, and rationalism, secondary. Those structures that Rosenzweig developed helped him to give a new picture of Judaism and Christianity. This was indeed a Copernican revolution. In that new thinking, Kabbala was conceived positively by him as Jewish myth and was used by him, as we shall see, in important parts of his philosophy. Scholars may ask, What is there to write about Kabbala when we know that Rosenzweig had a negative attitude toward mysticism? One can quote numerous critical expressions of Rosenzweig against mysti- cism. He presented the mystic as an almost immoral person and char- acterized him as a person who is open solely to God and closed off to the world; but Rosenzweig demanded the work of the human being in the world, here and now, to improve it and to help human beings. Rosenzweig's criticism was part of the spirit of his age, as he wished to distance himself from mysticism.' In his criticism of mysticism he may doi: 10.1093/mj/kjj003 O The Author 2005.

His description of the mystic is no doubt distorted; there were many mystics who were also working in the world. On the other hand, the interpreters of Rosenzweig should differentiate between myth and mysticism in Rosenzweig's writings. At one point in his life he even presented structures he developed within God, man, and the world using ideas taken from the Kabbala. One can see that Rosenzweig's knowledge of Kabbala was limited and that sometimes he quotes it incorrectly, but nevertheless he had a deep interest in it. Until now, I have presented Rosenzweig's interest in the myth of Kabbala. I also draw attention to his admissions of religious experi- ences, namely, that God spoke to him. Rosenzweig speaks of the fan- tastic idea that he was addressed by God. He, unlike Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber, Abraham Joshua Heschel, or Levinas, speaks of receiv- ing a revelation or a presence. Aside from Rosenzweig, Rabbi Soloveitchik and Rav Kook, too, speak of hearing a voice or of seeing a vision.2 Those extraordinary experiences that burst out of the depth of the soul strengthened them in moments of sorrow. Those admis- sions have parallels in mystical treatises. In Rosenzweig's case those experiences changed his life and were also central in his writings. Scholem, the greatest Kabbala scholar, wrote a beautiful apprecia- tive eulogy on Rosenzweig; though he did not touch on this personal element, he somehow had a critical judgment of Rosenzweig's attitude toward Kabbala. He was probably discontent with Rosenzweig's lack of complete devotion to Kabbala, a matter he deeply desired; at one point he compared Rosenzweig to a child captured by pagans. Rosen- zweig's critical and despising attitude toward the mystic may have hurt Scholem. No doubt Scholem, familiar with Rosenzweig's writings, was aware of the rudimentary knowledge of Kabbala in them. On the other hand, Scholem had a deeply positive attitude on Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption and his interest in myth and in Schelling. Around 1980 Idel, one of the most important young Kabbala scholars, discovered parallels between Kabbala and Rosenzweig. His extreme excitement led him to discussion with Scholem; yet this mate- rial did not convince Scholem.' Scholem no doubt did not appreciate Rosenzweig's interest or knowledge in Kabbala, whereas Idel pre- sented a pioneering essay on the similarities between Rosenzweig and Kabbala at the Rosenzweig Conference in Jerusalem in 1980. Idel's interpretation shows how Rosenzweig's construction of a theology of a mythical God is developed on the basis of midrashic and Kabbalistic sources. Rosenzweig wishes to replace the atheistic mythi- cal theology with a Jewish mythical theology. Idel brilliantly analyzes the article "Atheistic Theology" and "The Germ Cell" as they led to</page><page sequence="3">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 33 Rosenzweig's thought in The Star of Redemption. He also develops the idea of theomorphism, an interpretation that has parallels in Kabbala, and presents Rosenzweig's theory of language. I am starting with a presentation of Idel's thought and will develop it further. MY PLAN This article shows the use of Kabbala in Rosenzweig's writings as a basis for his thinking on Jewish myth. It then describes his positive attitudes to what one must define as mystical or religious experiences. I will thus touch on the following: The importance of his 1914 essay "Atheistic Theology" (reve- lation and redemption) From "Atheistic Theology" to The Star The importance of the 1917 letter "The Germ Cell," which explains creation Several aspects of Jewish Creation Rosenzweig's saying that "the true predecessors of my prob- lem are nevertheless in Kabbala"4 Theomorphism: Rosenzweig's theory of language5 Possible sources for Rosenzweig's learning of Kabbala Two major mystical experiences * The Star of David and its Kabbalistic meanings * A major religious experience of God that caused Rosenzweig's return to Judaism in summer and fall 1913 THE IMPORTANCE OF "ATHEISTIC THEOLOGY" Idel deals in detail with Rosenzweig's article "Atheistic Theology," the first essay Rosenzweig wrote after he decided in 1913 to remain a Jew. It was written in an attempt to replace the atheistic theory of the great and popular Martin Buber. Atheistic theology builds a myth around the life of Jesus, as one can see in the work of David Friedrich Strauss, or around the life of the Jewish people, as was done by Buber. Rosenzweig develops an alternative theory to that of Buber and Strauss. He con- siders their thoughts to be founded on ancient pagan myth that does not reach the absolute God. Rosenzweig instead uses Jewish mysticism for the structure of his philosophy. He criticizes the romantic pagan view, which saw no gap between God and man and no possibility for a commandment of God to man. Rosenzweig finds an absolute God and different possibilities of developing myth by using the theology of the</page><page sequence="4">34 Rivka Horwitz Kabbala. As Idel thinks, "Rosenzweig does not, however, divorce him- self completely from myth, but instead of anchoring the myth in the changing flow of life he anchors it, following the Kabbalistic mythol- ogy, in the life of God Himself, giving it an absolute speculative char- acter."6 For the young Buber there was no absolute God. It was related to me in the 1960s (by the old Hugo Bergman, who was my teacher) that in 1909, when the young Bergman received the learned Buber in Pra- gue at the railroad station, Bergman asked Buber how he conceived an absolute God. Buber answered: "I know no absolute God." His phi- losophy in those years was monistic, and the concept of God he had was a unity that was born out of human striving. (Years later, Buber actually accepted Rosenzweig's view of God.) Rosenzweig, on the other hand, claims that there is always an absolute God versus the lowly human being. Here starts Rosenzweig's philosophy of the dialogue. In his criticism of Buber, Rosenzweig comments that there is a desire for unity that is the highest goal of the Jewish people.7 Whereas Buber developed his theory in a way that dis- tances itself from the Jewish tradition, Rosenzweig claims that Judaism commands unity on account of God's revelation to the people. Accord- ing to Rosenzweig's essay, the founding principle of Judaism is receiv- ing the Kingdom of God, which precedes the acceptance of the commandments. Rosenzweig's ideas are influenced by Cohen and similar to those of Maimonides. The reciprocal relationship between the human being and God is a historical example of the yearning for unity that is implanted in the Jewish character through all generations. It develops a dichotomy between the metahistorical ideal of Judaism and its historical terres- trial expressions. This is the polarity between God and the Jewish peo- ple that is also related to the understanding of the idea of the Shekhina, an idea that is further developed in The Star. Rosenzweig explains, in the spirit of Cohen, that in Jewish tradi- tion the important idea of unity is transferred from the realm of dogma to that of ethics. That is, the unity of God is not a static declara- tion but a dynamic ethical one depending on human will and per- formed daily. This direction originated in times bygone; its source can be found in the writings of the prophets. In "Atheistic Theology," Rosenzweig relies on the important medieval book of Bachya ibn Paquda: Duties of the Heart. The philosophy of that book centers on the very important idea that God's unity is exemplified in the acts of the commandments. Rosenzweig shows that Kabbalists received their the- ory from Bachya, which, he notes, scholars had recently proved.8 In addition to emphasizing the identity of ethics with the unity of God, Rosenzweig also exemplifies the dialogue between the Jew and</page><page sequence="5">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 35 God, which he discovers in the blessings before the Shema prayer. These prayers express the mutual relationship between God and the human being in which the human being unifies with the maker and God unifies with the human being. In the blessings before the Shema, we say, "Thou has ... brought us near to thy truly great name, that we eagerly praise thee and acclaim thy Oneness."9 FROM "ATHEISTIC THEOLOGY" TO THE STAR Rosenzweig anchors his theology in Kabbala, which presented him with the dynamic mythical dialogue he sought. In "Atheistic Theol- ogy" he writes: "It is not by chance that the famous maxim of one of the masters of Kabbala [says], 'if you do not bear witness to me, then I am not' [viz., Isa. 43:12]-is spoken as the word of God, and read into the maxim by an exegetical device. God makes himself dependent upon the testimony of man."'o On this Idel comments, "The close relation or even the dependency of the divine on the human is expressed or rather revealed by God himself."" Here is a theistic per- spective that assumes a revealing God as the alternative. The midrashic quotation that Rosenzweig notes is from the "master of Kabbala," Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, to whom the Zohar is ascribed and who became a major figure in the thoughts of the Kabbalists. The saying is historically from an ancient Midrash (Pesikta de-Rav Kahana) older than the Kabbala, a fact that Rosenzweig may not have known. He quotes it as though it were Kabbala, and no doubt it fits that line of thought, because it shows that God's strength depends on human sup- port. Though Rosenzweig's knowledge of Kabbala was minimal, he understood its spirit and continued to develop major issues in which he wished to recapture the spirit of the Kabbala. What Rosenzweig writes in "Atheistic Theology" he develops fur- ther in The Star, where the central theme is revelation, dialogue, and love. In the middle part of the book he explains the midrashic quota- tion of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. Rosenzweig writes: The trusting faith of the beloved affirms the momentary love of the lover and consolidates it too into something enduring. This is requited love: the faith of the beloved in the lover. By its trust, the faith of the soul attests the love of God and endows it with enduring being. If you testify to me, then I am God, and not otherwise-thus the master of Kabbala lets the God of love declare. The lover who sacrifices himself in love is recreated anew in the trust of the beloved, and this time forever. When the soul is first overcome by the tremors of the love of the lover, it hears "unto eternity" in itself which is no self-delusion."2 Rosenzweig quotes and explains in The Star what he started to develop in "Atheistic Theology." He builds his philosophy on the idea</page><page sequence="6">36 Rivka Horwitz that God's love is renewed and strengthened by human love and is felt as being eternal. This is a Kabbalistic myth based on the Talmud, Midrash, and prayer. Continuing that spirit, Warren Ze'ev Harvey writes: "The Star may be described as an attempt to recapture and to reformulate the Judaism of 'the Master of Kabbalah."''3 Revelation is developed in the middle book of The Star, where one can see that the human being adds power to the divine and the divine adds power to the human being. This idea is presented from a differ- ent angle in the end of The Star in relation to redemption. In this spirit, Harvey thought that just as Rosenzweig at the outset of The Star shatters the totality of the All into the three fragmentary pieces of God, man, and the world, Rosenzweig explains toward the end of The Star that, by performing the commandment of the Torah in a Kabbalistic manner, the Jew redeems God, the world, and man. Harvey asks and I join him: "Is this not the theme-and the climax-of the whole book?" He adds: "Rosenzweig writes matter-of-factly that before per- forming the commandments of the Torah, the Jew-not the Kabbalist, but the regular unhyphenated Jew!-recites the formula: 'for the sake of uniting the holy God and His Shechina."''"4 Redemption plays a central role in the end of the book. Rosenzweig considers the Jew as an introvert having deep roots within him- or herself. But nonetheless one's religious experiences attach the Jew less to the external world and more to the divine. Rosenzweig writes: "The Jew cannot descend into his own interior without at the same time ascending to the highest.""5 According to Rosenzweig, redemption is the hopeful eternal unity between God and human beings. In the Torah we often find terrestrial rewards given to the righ- teous for fulfilling the commandments. In contrast to this philosophy, Rosenzweig quotes the words of the Mishna Avot (1:3): "Be not like servants who minister to their master upon the condition of receiving a reward."'6 Rosenzweig's explanation is taken from the Kabbala and is related to tikkun, a spiritual desire to redeem the world by uniting God and His Shechina. According to him, the Jew fulfills endless pre- cepts and commandments, for this purpose: "With this formula, the individual, the remnant, prepares his heart in 'awe and love' to fulfill 'in the name of all Israel' whatever commandment is at the moment incumbent on him. He will gather the sparks of the glory of God which is dispersed in countless places all over the world, out of the dis- persion, and one day bring them back home to Him." The fulfilling of the commandments is a kind of reunion: "The Jew calls it to unify God." It brings redemption nearer: "In the innermost constriction of the Jewish heart shines the Star of Redemption."'7 This line of thought is based on the Lurianic Kabbala, the Kabbala of Rabbi Isaac Luria of Safed of the sixteenth century, which was</page><page sequence="7">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 37 spread in Europe in the forthcoming generations. The idea is based on the concept that sparks of the Holy One were dispersed in the world and it is the duty of the Jew to gather the scattered holy sparks. The fulfilling of the commandments is considered a tikkun, the repair- ing and the unifying of God. Idel writes: "God who gives Himself over to suffering makes it possible for the Jewish people to redeem Him through a process of tikkun, . . . the loving God is rebuilt . .. through man's love."'8 Similarly, Rosenzweig describes the descent of the Shekhina and God upon man. "Mysticism," he writes (overlooking his critique of the mystic), "bridges the gap between the 'God of our Fathers' and 'The Remnant of Israel' with the doctrine of the Shekhina. The Shekhina, God's descent upon man and his sojourn among men, is pictured as a dichotomy taking place in God Himself. ... The idea of the wander- ings of the Shekhina, of the sparks of the original divine light being scattered about the world, this casts all of revelation between the Jew- ish God and Jewish Man, and thereby anchors both, God as well as the remnant, in all the depth of-revelation."'9 God's love to His people is so great that He is ready to send His sojourn to be with them, and the Shekhina joins them in their sorrows. Because He gives Himself to His people they therefore wish to redeem Him. Love and revelation are the central theme of The Star. In the central book of The Star, the interpretation of the Song of Songs is presented. It is seen as a dialogue between the lover and the beloved, the king and the shepherd, the bride and the bridegroom, an expression of the love between the human and God. The human being is the bride, and God is the unfaithful bridegroom. The very special Jewish interpretation of the divine love is in the end of The Star. The love is not only the secret biblical story of the Song of Songs, the love between the human soul and the divine, but the love of the entire Jewish people, "the Remnant of Israel," and "the God of our Fathers." THE IMPORTANCE OF "THE GERM CELL" Rosenzweig's interpretation of creation is based on thoughts he devel- oped only in 1917, in a letter to Rudi Ehrenberg called "The Germ Cell of the Star of Redemption."20 When one reads "The Germ Cell" one can see that Rosenzweig explicitly says that his interpretation of creation is based on Kabbala. But since most Rosenzweig scholars have no interest in Kabbala, and some even reject the consideration of any affinity between the two, it was not discovered. In 1914 revelation and redemption were established in Franz Rosenzweig's mind. At that time, he had ideas but no system. Only in</page><page sequence="8">38 Rivka Horwitz 1917 did he discover his system: the triangle, in which the three sub- stances God, man, and world would never merge to become one and yet relations would exist among the three. Thus, Rosenzweig estab- lished God as absolute, as the Creator of the world. In "The Germ Cell" he writes: "God exists before all relation, both between Him and the world and Him and Himself, and only this existence of God which is completely non-hypothetical is the origin of the reality of God." This is founded on the idea of the Zimzum (contraction): "God pre- cedes not only His revealed essence (Selbstentaeusserung) but his essence itself (Selbst) (as taught, to the best of my knowledge, by Lurianic mysticism, as I once told you)."21 Idel explains, "Here we have a clear testimony of a conversation that Rosenzweig held before 1917 which shows his familiarity with Lurianic Kabbala."22 Rosenzweig believes in the existence of an Absolute Divine beyond what Schelling calls the "somber basis." Rosenzweig builds his theory on an absolute God who precedes all relations, and only through the Zimzum, the contraction, of the divine to himself and to the world could creation take place. But the dialectic of Yes and No belongs to a pre-Lurianic period of the Kabbala. The Infinite, the Non-nothingness is beyond the Yes and No. The Yes can be seen as an allusion to Hokhma, an interpreta- tion of the term Bereshith, "in the beginning." The No alludes to Binah. Idel explains Rosenzweig's theory as resembling that of the Ismailia theology, where the infinite is "equally incapable of being affirmed or negated."" God is beyond the category of "Being" and that of "Not- Being." For Rosenzweig God is beyond the No, the point where German mysticism starts. German mysticism starts with a No, whereas Kabbala starts with a Yes. SEVERAL ASPECTS OF JEWISH CREATION In book 3 of The Star, Jewish content is poured into the more univer- sal dialectic of God and world that was earlier constructed. Here Rosenzweig shows how the world of the Jew is filled with Jewish lines of thought from the Bible, Midrash, and Kabbala. In book 3, Cre- ation, referring to the general creation of the world, becomes the spe- cific relationship between "the God of our Fathers" and the Torah. Mysticism, Rosenzweig claims, shows that the Torah is the bridge between God and the world. Some of the ideas developed here were repeated later in his popular article "The Builders." Rosenzweig, with his use of midrashim and Kabbala, wishes to form a Jewish world. He writes, "The Torah was thought to have been created prior to the world, and the world for its part [was created] on behalf of the</page><page sequence="9">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 39 Torah." In this conception of the Midrash, the Torah is not conceived as Law, and neither can the stories of the Bible be the essential Torah, but it is a consideration of a preexistential Torah that has a different foundation. As Rosenzweig writes, "It was really sensed as a funda- mental pillar of the world, and even the notion that God himself studies his Torah thus now gained a general, supra-Jewish sense."24 Rosenzweig connects the story of creation to the tale of the Chariot of Ezekiel. He writes: "Jewish mysticism bridges the gap between the 'God of our Fathers' and the 'Torah' in a special manner of its own. It replaces the general concept of creation with that of Ezekiel's Chariot."25 Idel explains, "Franz Rosenzweig admits that Jewish mysticism replaces the general concept of creation with that of the 'mysterious or hidden creations,' the 'tale of the chariot' as it is called in an allusion to a vision of Ezekiel."26 The world of creation is full of mysterious relations to the Torah, and the Torah does appear as a key to the enigma of the world. This is the very opposite of Spinoza's method of interpreting the Bible in a simplistic way. Spinoza's method roused the world to secularization and to Bible criticism. On the other hand, Rosenzweig relies on the Midrash, the ancient rabbinic interpretation, where it says: the Torah precedes the cre- ation, or God looked at the Torah and created the world. Rosenzweig thinks that the plain wording of the Torah conceals a hidden meaning that expresses the essence of the world. For the Jew, the Torah can replace the book of nature and even the starry heaven; this thought of Rosenzweig's can be an allusion to Psalms 19. For example, based on B Talmud Sukkah 55a and on Rashi there, Rosenzweig discovers that the seventy offerings on the Feast of Taber- nacles allude to the seventy "nations of the world," lending a universal character to this holiday. In addition, the seventy sacrifices are equated "by legend on the basis of Tabula Gentuim in Genesis.""27 He also shows how the legendary number of 248 bones in the human body is juxtaposed to the number of words in the prayer "Hear O Israel." In this way the words of the psalmist, "All my bones will say, 'Lord, who is like You?"' (Ps. 35:10), can be fulfilled.28 And thus the Jewish God and Jewish Torah embrace the whole creation. TRANSITION Kabbala can be found in all three books of The Star. In the third book we see it in relation to redemption; in the second book we see it with regard to revelation; and in the first book we shall see it now in rela- tion to the very construction of the dialectic within each element, in</page><page sequence="10">40 Rivka Horwitz God, man, and the world. In the first book of The Star, one finds a pre- sentation of the construction of Rosenzweig's system in relation to cre- ation. For him the absolute beginning is the Non-nothingness. He believes that within each of the three elements-God, man, and the world-there is an inner dialectic of Yes and No. Rosenzweig inter- prets this triadic dialectic in a way that resembles Kabbalistic terms. I tend to conclude that when he wrote The Star, the dialectic structure may have been influenced by the famous German philosopher Schelling and only later in 1922 he realized with joy that his predecessor in this dialectic construction is in Kabbala. In his Diary and only there, not in The Star, does he use the term En Sof. In the 1922 fragment, he speaks of the three elements, God, man, and the world, as having a Kabbalistic structure. His interpretation is very flexible when considering the three elements as "purely empirical," and there is an emphasis on fac- ticity.29 Nevertheless, the structure ofEn Sof, the Yes and No that are abstract and stem from the Kabbala, is then adapted by Rosenzweig to God, man, and the world. This dialectic structure of the three ele- ments can also be found in Kabbalistic treatises. Rosenzweig is saying: "The true predecessors of my problem are nevertheless in Kabbala.""o From his diary entry on June 22, 1922, it is evident that Rosenzweig at that time thought that the Kabbala was his true predecessor. What does he mean to say? I wish to suggest that the major novelty of the fragment is his use of the term En Sof, referring to the highest aspect of God. He may have learned it in more recent times, because it does not occur in The Star. Rosenzweig must have realized that the dialectic in The Star can be seen as Kabbala. This was also Idel's interpretation when he saw parallels between the dialectic of the Kabbala and Rosen- zweig's theory of Creation. On the other hand, in 1933 Else Freund interpreted Rosenzweig's dialectic as based on Schelling.3" Perhaps in the beginning, Rosenzweig himself also thought that his dialectic was based on Schelling, but in 1922, he concluded that the Kabbala was his real predecessor. THE TEXT OF THE DIARY Georg Lassons new Hegelianism depends steckt on a one dimension interpre- tation of the monad. While Hegel, as an idealist, could only have started with M [man], one could similarly start also with W [world] or with G [God]. The true predecessors of my problem are nevertheless in the Kabbala. However I show that the problem of Kabbala is not specifically theological (but En Sof appears in the same way with regards to M [man] and W [world]) and in the priority of the theological which the Kabbala presents, the real time can only be based on (that which really happens not that which unfolds itself, etc.) which contradicts the pure theory of Potency.</page><page sequence="11">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 41 My thought of harmonizing this [Kabbala] with the healthy human under- standing relates to 2 points: 1) The reality of space, that means the inadmissibility of coincidentia opposi- torum [coincidence of opposite]. God = World (not = man, etc.). 2) The reality of time, that means the inadmissibility of the category of eter- nity to enter somehow into the occurrence. My advantage toward the healthy human understanding is only, that I bring together the two opposite points which contradict each other. The antique idealism had denied, according to Philo, the time in order to be able to give the substances a metaphysical reality etc. I ostracize the concept of eternity out of the occurrence but I also ostracize the occurrence from the concept. I disclaim that the two greatest wisdoms of philosophy are "the unity of all beings" and "the plurality of occurrences." Interpretation of the Fragment Rosenzweig's point of departure is his rejection of Hegel's idealistic structure. In its place he constructs a philosophy of three elements. Although Kabbala is usually monistic and rarely has three elements, Rosenzweig founds his philosophy on a metaphysics of three ele- ments, G, M, and W. Why does he name a theory so different from Kabbala, Kabbala? No doubt he found a resemblance between his theory and the Kabbala that intrigued him. He sees Kabbala as a flexible term and discovers that the dialectic of the elements can be considered Kabbala. This is one of the most important points of his philosophy. The three elements, God, man, and the world, contain an inner dialectic of Yes and No (Kether and Chochma). Each of the elements has a structure. In The Star Rosenzweig does not yet have the concept of En Sof to work with, but in the fragment he does. As mentioned, Idel shows in a very persuasive manner how Rosenz- weig's theory in The Star resembles Kabbala. But Rosenzweig him- self expressed this only in 1922, when he became aware of the resemblance. On the other hand, Rosenzweig explains how he objects to seeing his philosophy as Kabbala. First, Kabbala is a theology, and he wishes to build a philosophy of God, man, and world. Second, Kabbala has a theory of Sefirot, which Rosenzweig calls potencies. These he negates. And finally, Kabbala deals with unfolding time, and Rosenzweig demands real-time occurrences here and now. With regard to space, Rosenzweig means to say that opposites, such as G and W, cannot coincide; no pantheism is possible. The W can only be worldly, and G can only be Divine, and no coincident of opposites can exist. In relation to time, Rosenzweig shows here his objection to eternity. He demands that one should consider things as</page><page sequence="12">42 Rivka Horwitz they happen in everyday life and not in abstraction. This idea remark- ably resembles the philosophy of Buber. Rosenzweig wanted to hold the rope on both ends: Kabbala and life, Kabbala and the here and now, which are usually considered con- tradictory. From Kabbala he took the dialectic within the elements, the Yes and No. In this fragment Rosenzweig admits for the first time that his dialectic is from the Kabbala. However, his philosophy is con- structed not merely on God but also on man and the world. Each ele- ment has an inner dialectic that resembles Kabbala. In 1922 he realized that this is the Kabbala present in his work. THEOMORPHISM Theomorphism is the theory of language that Rosenzweig develops in his writings. Idel told me that this theory impressed him deeply and was even the catalyst that brought him to study Kabbala in Rosenzweig's work. This theological linguistic theory of Rosenzweig's appears dar- ing in its opposition to the rational Spinozistic Hegelian approach that was accepted in Rosenzweig's time. Whereas Spinoza is the peak of rationalism and rejects biblical anthropomorphism, Rosenzweig sup- ports it, calling his theory theomorphism. God does not speak in the language of the human, but the human speaks in the language of the divine (see below). When language originates in God it is most real. Rosenzweig rejects the rationalist claim that the Torah speaks in human language but shares the Kabbalists' claim that the human being speaks in God's language. For Rosenzweig this theory is central in his interpretation of the dialogue. It is to be assumed that Rosenzweig did not know that his theory exists in Kabbalistic treatises such as the ones of Emmanuel Hai Rikki. But Idel was extremely surprised when reading Rosenzweig, and this called his attention. Hai Rikki's theory can also be compared to the view of Rabbi Joseph Gikatilia and that of Rabbi Joseph Ergas, who wrote that God in His mercy permit- ted us to speak in the language of the Torah, allowing us to call our eye an eye as a reminder to us of His providence. This view is opposite Maimonides' presentation and theory of language. Rosenzweig believes that "the word of man is in the word of God."32 He writes, "Man loves because God loves and as God loves."33 The Song of Songs is not a worldly song but a divine one. The idea of theomorphism, to which Idel pointed, is the founda- tion of Rosenzweig's theology. This is a radical attack on Greek philos- ophy. In Greek philosophy God is eternal and all knowing. This is unlike biblical thinking, where God is described as anthropomorphic: God creates the world; He loves, hears, sees; He does not know ahead</page><page sequence="13">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 43 of time what man will do; and He does what He had previously not known. Rosenzweig writes, "God contradicts his eternity with his tem- porality."34 Or, as it is written in Dostoyevsky's Karamazov, God contra- dicts himself with his world. THE STAR OF DAVID AS A KABBALISTIC SYMBOL The star has central meaning in Rosenzweig's life and thought. It is fortunate that in several letters he describes his visions of the star. In a letter dated October 4, 1918, he describes an experience at night while gazing at the stars.35 It seems that nights were sometimes quite frightening for him, and sleep did not come easily. Similar to the con- ditions of a soldier in the army, he was isolated in a lonely, very dark night. He was uncertain of his surroundings, fearing he saw ghosts. Thus the sight of the stars had a stronger impact on him. Rosenzweig's experience gazing at the stars inspired him to write The Star of Redemption. The book, in its entirety, was written in ecstasy, an outcome of these experiences. In this letter he also recalls the experience he had a year prior while writing "The Germ Cell" as well as his experience when he started writing the book. He mentions that during the transition between book 1 and book 2 of The Star, his experience was magnified. There were moments when "suddenly everything radiated bright": "The wealth of direct vision is the truth and its verification is later in its being carried out." He also wrote, "I saw the star, and most remarkable it turned around itself and within it could be seen all I had to write." The star he witnessed in heaven expressed his Jewish iden- tity. Rosenzweig presented his whole philosophy in a concise manner using the symbol of the Star of David. Rosenzweig develops the Star of David as an expression of his philosophic theory. He analyzes each triangle of the Star separately. The first triangle symbolizes the three elements: God, man, and the world. The second triangle expresses the relations among the ele- ments: creation, revelation, and redemption. Creation is the relation between God and the world. Revelation is the relation between God and the human being. Last, redemption is the work of the human being upon the world in order to redeem it. In this manner Rosenzweig uses the Star of David as an expression of the six major points of his biblical philosophy. Another component of Rosenzweig's ambivalent attitude to the Star of David lies in his complicated friendship with Eugen Rosenstock- Huessy. Rosenzweig had to defend his Jewish identity against his friend and opponent Rosenstock-Huessy, who wanted to convert him to Christianity. Rosenstock-Huessy called his major thesis "The Cross</page><page sequence="14">44 Rivka Horwitz of Reality." His theory is based on the four angles of the cross. His analysis may have been the catalyst leading Rosenzweig to develop a contrasting theory based on the Jewish Star. The usage of the Jewish Star on necklaces as a symbol of Jewish identity is typical for our age, showing our need for such an identity. The Star had several meanings for Rosenzweig. It was a philosophi- cal symbol expressing his metaphysical structure. It also expressed his deep Jewish identity. Finally, it expressed a deeper Kabbalistic symbol alluding to the myth with which he identified himself. We saw that Rosenzweig had a vague idea that the Star is a Kabbalistic symbol. This fact no doubt played a major role for him. After he finished the intense period in which he wrote The Star, he took time to check libraries, searching for the Kabbalistic sources of this symbol. Prior to his vision, Rosenzweig mistakenly thought that the Jewish Star, made up of two triangles, is an ancient Jewish myth found in the Kabbala. He wished to anchor his Judaism in this myth. In two letters, Rosenzweig discusses the figure of the Star of David as an allusion to his whole system. His first letter was written when he was beginning to write his masterpiece at a rapid pace. The second letter was written a few weeks after the completion of the work. Since we know the dates in which he wrote the book, we can know these details in precision." Three days after he started writing his great work, on August 25, 1918, he wrote a letter to Gritli, saying: "On every piece of paper that I have close by I draw my little star. I had never thought that I would once occupy myself seriously with that figure. Its usage in the synagogue always appeared to me indeed dif- ficult and not appealing (unsympathisch). However, the Kabbala had dealt with it. But I do not know any details.""7 Rosenzweig later drew the star on the cover of his published book and triangles on each part of the book. He wished to use the figure of the hexagram to allude to the structure of his philosophy as well as his Jewish iden- tity. The Jewish Star grew out of his deepest, innermost emotions and thoughts. Yet it was Rosenzweig's error that the Jewish Star has its sources in Kabbalistic thought. The second letter of Rosenzweig's dealing with the Star of David dates March 12, 1919-three weeks after the completion of his mas- terpiece. In this letter Rosenzweig relates his visit to a library in Berlin. He writes, "Dear Gritli, I just came home. . . . I was today for many hours in the community library (Gemeindebibliothek) and I was a real detective. After all (the investigations) however, I can determine the following: I have no forerunners with regard to the Star,-unfortunately. The basic concepts of the Kabbala are directly related to a figure of an anthropos. Too bad. I really have no more respect for what I have done, if it really starts only with me."38</page><page sequence="15">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 45 Gershom Scholem, the greatest Kabbala scholar, wrote an article titled "The Star of David: History of a Symbol."39 In it he shows that the hexagram is not an ancient Jewish symbol; it does not originate in the Bible or in the Talmud. According to Scholem, this symbol was first used in the Middle Ages in magic formulas, practical Kab- bala.40 Rosenzweig's usage of the Star of David as a symbol of redemption on his book may have added to its importance in mod- ern Judaism.4' The Nazis compelled the Jews to wear yellow badges with a Jewish Star on them-to denigrate the Jews. With the estab- lishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Star of David was put on the Israeli flag. Rosenzweig's historical research led him to the correct conclusion; the Star is not a Kabbalistic symbol. Rosenzweig's disappointment is evident when he realized that he had no forerunners in Kabbala sup- porting his original theory of the importance of the Star. I assume that as the result of this disappointing conclusion he then added in the end of the book an analysis of the Face, that is, the Face of God, which alludes to the anthropos combined with the Jewish Star. One can see that while writing the closing passages of the book Rosenzweig lived in ecstasy. It is interesting to note that he places the roots of this myth in the Blessing of the Priests of the Book of Numbers 6:25: "May He make His countenance shine upon you." Rosenzweig was familiar with this blessing, which is said during festi- val prayers in the Diaspora. These words may express an experience of God. But first Rosenzweig developed a fantastic myth to combine the Face and the Star. THE STAR OF DAVID AND THE DIVINE FACE It appears that the two symbols, the Star of David and the Face of God, are intertwined in Rosenzweig's descriptions. It could be that after his investigation in the library and his discovery that the anthro- pos plays a central role in Kabbala, he decided to bring the two images together. He explains, "Just as the Star mirrors its elements and the combi- nation of the elements into one route in its two superimposed trian- gles, so too the organs of the countenance divide into two levels. ... Thus it is not human illusion if Scripture speaks of God's countenance and even of his separate bodily parts. There is no other way to express the Truth. Only when we see the Star as countenance do we transcend every possibility and simply see."42 This interpretation of the bodily features of God is one of Rosenzweig's central themes, as we have seen previously with the idea of theomorphism.</page><page sequence="16">46 Rivka Horwitz As we shall see, in The Star he interprets the two triangles as separate organs of the Face. He differentiates between the passive and active organs. The active ones include the eyes that shine forth and the mouth "by whose words man lives." As we know, language and speech play a very prominent role in Rosenzweig's philosophy. The active organs are the dominant ones. Rosenzweig even separates the function of the left eye from that of the right and sees an asymmetry in the sight of each one. Rosenzweig condenses his whole philosophy into the Face and the two tri- angles of the Star of David. His philosophy is more anthropomorphic than any other modern philosophy. The six angles appear to him in the form of the organs of the human face. It is the divine Face, because the human is an imitation of the divine. He writes: The basic level is ordered according to the receptive organs; they are the building blocks, as it were, which together compose the face, the mask, namely, forehead and cheeks, to which belong respectively nose and ears. Nose and ears are the organs of pure receptivity. . . . The nose belongs to the forehead. In the sacred tongue [Hebrew] it veritable stands for the face as a whole [appayim]. The scent of offerings turns to it as the motion of the lips to the ears. This first triangle is thus formed by the midpoint of the forehead, as the dominant point of the entire face and the midpoint of the cheeks. Over it is now imposed a second triangle, composed of the organs whose activity quickens the rigid mask of the first: eyes and mouth. ... Just as the structure of the face is dominated by the forehead, so its life all that surrounds the eyes and shines forth from the eyes, is gathered in the mouth. The mouth is consummator and fulfiller of all expression of which the countenance is capable, both in speech as, at last, in the silence behind which speech retreats: in the kiss.43 The Kiss The kiss, alluded to here, can be interpreted as readiness for martyr- dom and/or a mystical attitude toward death. One can find the idea of the kiss in midrash Shir Hashirim Raba (1, 2), which deals with the inter- pretation of the Song of Songs, where it says, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth." The midrash explains that Moses and his brother Aaron died as the Torah says, al pi hashem, not by a command of God but by a kiss of God. There are two ways to interpret pi, "mouth" or "according." The midrash prefers the interpretation of "mouth." The Talmud in Bava Batra says that their sister Miriam, too, died by a kiss of God, though al pi hashem is absent in her case for rea- sons of humility (God did not kiss a woman). We can infer from here that the midrash explains the kiss of God in an anthropomorphic way. Rosenzweig ends this myth of the Face with a moving description of death brought on by a kiss from the mouth of God. He writes, "God sealed this completed life with a kiss of his mouth."44</page><page sequence="17">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 47 Maimonides brings together the ideas of death and the love of the Song of Songs. Rosenzweig strengthens this unification by alluding to martyrdom. Maimonides writes in The Guide of the Perplexed: "In the pleasure of this apprehension due to the intensity of passionate love. In this dictum the Sages, may their memory be blessed, followed the general poetical way of expression that calls the apprehension that is achieved in a state of intense and passionate love for Him, may He be exalted, a kiss, in accordance with the dictum: 'Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth' (Songs 1:2)" (111,51). Rosenzweig goes even further, quoting "Love is as strong as death" from the Song of Songs (8:6). By the love of God to his beloved, there is a readiness for her to die, in order to sanctify the name of God.45 Paradoxically love and life are realized through death. In the beginning of The Star, death and the fear of death are described as a most dreadful threat to the human being. As Rosenzweig describes, idealism has no answer to this fear and misleads the human being, saying, "Death is nothing." After shattering that philos- ophy, Rosenzweig builds his own in the middle of The Star, around the biblical dialogue. He discusses there the readiness to hear God and respond and love of God unto death. In the end of this masterpiece, Rosenzweig returns to this theme, in his presentation of the readiness for martyrdom, to die by the kiss of God. Michael Fishbane develops similar ideas to what we find in The Star in his book The Kiss of God.46 Fishbane shows how there is a transvaluation of values when one rec- ognizes that life without God "is death."47 And the major demand of Judaism is to love God! In his diary Rosenzweig wrote, on June 9, 1922, a note that was actually a will, demanding that the inscription on his grave be "I am always with you" from Psalms 73:23.48 Rosenzweig ends this section of The Star with a daring description of God's revelation to him: "God, who is the last and the first-He unlocked to me the doors of the sanctuary which is built in the inner most middle. He allowed Himself to be seen. He led me to the border of life where seeing is vouchsafed. 'For no man shall see Him and live.' Thus, that sanctuary where He granted me to see Him had to be a segment of the hypercosmos in the world itself, a life beyond life."'49 Rosenzweig's description can be likened to the High Priest on Yom Kippur who went into the Holiest of Holies and witnessed God. ROSENZWEIG'S RETURN TO JUDAISM Rosenzweig's conversion crisis is the central element in his biography. Mystical experiences surrounding these events triggered his return to Judaism. This dramatic story can be read in a new light based on</page><page sequence="18">48 Rivka Horwitz recently disclosed evidence. From this new evidence we can draw the following conclusions. First, there was no specific Yom Kippur experi- ence. This day was important for him; he had also fasted the year before; and he describes this day in extraordinary colors in The Star. Yet, as far as we can see, Yom Kippur played no specific role in 1913. Rosenzweig's return was a gradual process that took a number of months. Second, his hesitation in faith was founded on his deep desire not to sever ties with his Christian friends, primarily Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. Rosenzweig's dilemma was not based on his lack of belief in the truth of Judaism or on his sudden conviction in the truth of Christianity. The possibility of a dialogue between the Jew and Christian convinced Rosenzweig that there was no necessity to convert. Let me explain matters a little. On July 7, 1913, Franz Rosenzweig and Rosenstock-Huessy became involved in a heated debate in the presence of his cousin, Rudi Ehrenberg. Rosenstock-Huessy was a converted Jew. His powerful personality awakened Rosenzweig from the slumber of his liberal and rational thinking. Rosenzweig began to see the enormous powers of sincere faith. However, Rosenstock- Huessy identified faith with Christianity. He was determined to lead Rosenzweig to Christian faith. Feeling weak in his position, Rosenzweig promised his friend that he was ready to be baptized. In spite of this, he remembered later, in a letter to Gritli in 1917, that when he came to his room the following morning, he wanted to commit suicide with a pistol he had.5o It is not fitting for a person who promises to convert to have intentions of ending his or her life. Following this episode Rosenzweig left Leipzig, avoiding his Christian friends. He speaks of plans to visit archives and libraries in Heidelberg, Stuttgart, and Tiibingen. But we have no letters from him from July to October. It seems that in those critical months he was not in contact with his friends. "Uncle Adam," the most influential figure in his early Jewish life, died five years earlier. Gritli was not yet part of the circle. In The Star Rosenzweig writes: "Its flame must eternally feed upon itself. It requires no fuel from outside.""51 He was alone in his crisis. His Judaism was his treasure, but in those weeks he was still ambivalent about his conversion. In the Christian theology, the roles of paganism and Judaism are different. His friends, Hans and Eugen, though born Jewish, converted as pagans. Rosenzweig, on the other hand, insisted on converting as a Jew, probably in order to demon- strate that Judaism had finished its role in the world. In 1913 the High Holidays, New Year's and the Day of Atone- ment, were in October. That year, New Year's fell on Thursday and Friday, and the Day of Atonement, on Shabbat-October 11. Rosenzweig came to Kassel to spend the New Year's holiday with his parents. His mother did not know of his conversion plans, which shows how</page><page sequence="19">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 49 undecided he was.52 Once she found out, however, she thought it was inappropriate for him to attend synagogue. On New Year's he was nevertheless present at the synagogue, where Rabbi Dr. Max Doktor, an assimilated, unimpressive, weak person, officiated.5" (Years ago Kassel had the impressive Rabbi Dr. Isaac Prager, but he died in 1906.) Rosenzweig probably sat in the seat of his late "uncle" Adam, the family seat in the synagogue. This probably gave him a feeling of belonging, though he probably felt disappointed by the sermon of Rabbi Doktor. After the holiday he left Kassel and went to Berlin for the Day of Atonement. According to Bruno Strauss, Rosenzweig went to the German orthodox synagogue "Potsdamer Brticke," where Rabbi Dr. Marcus Petuchowski led the services.54 It was one of the important orthodox synagogues in Berlin. Petuchowski was a Vilna-born rabbi, known as a learned person, and a good speaker who had influence on the youth. Ten days later, October 31, 1913, Rosenzweig wrote Rudi the impor- tant letter: "After prolonged, and I believe thorough, self-examination, I have reversed my decision. It [the conversion] no longer seems nec- essary to me, and therefore, being what I am, no longer possible. I will remain a Jew." In the continuation of this letter we find Rosenzweig's theological description of the disparate roles of Judaism and Chris- tianity. In the same letter he writes, "We are wholly agreed as to what Christ and his church mean to the world: no one can reach the Father save through him. No one can reach the Father because he is already with him.""55 Six years later, in 1919, Rosenzweig tried to explain to his friend and Christian cousin, Rudi, what had occurred to him in 1913. In a letter dated August 25, 1919, he writes that on the day he arrived in Berlin, one of the days between New Year's and the Day of Atone- ment, he experienced the hope. That is, he reached the hope to remain a Jew and that there is a possibility for Jewish-Christian rela- tions. It was on this day that he decided to remain a Jew, thus starting to overcome his dilemma. According to what Rosenzweig presents in that letter, he was not drawn to Christianity by Christ but, rather, by his Christian friends. Because he loved his friends dearly and was deeply attached to them, he did not want to leave them. The source of his mistake, as he explained, was that he did not explicitly emphasize his Jewishness. They, unaware of it, pressured him to convert, especially Eugen Rosenstock-Hussey. Rosenstock-Hussey was a deeply religious person and a zealous missionary who could not "accept that a Jew is a Jew.""56 In a letter to Eugen, in 1916, Rosenzweig writes: "I find that every- thing that I want to write is something I can't express to you. For now I would have to show you Judaism from within, that is, to be able to</page><page sequence="20">50 Rivka Horwitz show it to you in a hymn, just as you are able to show me, the outsider, Christianity. And for the very reason that you can do it, I cannot. Christianity has its soul in its externals; Judaism, on the outside, has only its hard protecting shell and one can speak of its soul only from within.""' Rosenzweig later demanded from them to accept him as a Jew, which Rosenstock-Hussey sometimes did.58 The different approaches are clearly expressed in Rosenzweig's letter to Rudi in 1919. He writes, The facts are that there is an unbridgeable difference in faith which Eugen failed to recognize. But that was my fault. Because in my love to him I received him easily in his faith, whereas he forgot that his faith was not even a little bit mine. Therefore hard words were necessary, simply to put things back in the right order. Because if Eugen did not see things in their place, he destroyed everything that ties me and him because our roots are separate, only our tree- tops are grown into the other; if he uproots my roots, the treetop dies. I tried only this: to find again the tune which was in danger to get lost by the dogmatic notes. Those weeks were difficult for me. For Eugen too, but in a dif- ferent way. He did not suffer from me but from Judaism. And he did not have the strength to overcome his animosity to Judaism by his love to human beings. Reevaluating his dilemma of 1913, Rosenzweig mentions in his letter to Rudi dating to 1919 three cardinal experiences: faith, love, and hope. He writes: I have not experienced at that whole time, from August to September 1913 for one moment Christ himself, but always Eugen and next to Eugen a little bit you. But primarily Eugen. If it had been otherwise, then I would certainly, after all what I know be a Christian. But it was not so. My whole experience was also then [1913] not Christ, (an experience of faith) but Christians (an experience of love). My experience of faith remained all the time Jewish, as you know. And in the moment when I experienced for the first time the hope, once and for all, on the first day of my arrival in Berlin, there I found the objective basis: the contradiction between my love experience and my faith. (Emphasis added)59 On this all is founded. Rosenzweig reminds Rudi that his faith was always the Jewish faith. This was the treasure of his past that he always cherished. His problem, as aforementioned, was his desire for unity with his Christians friends and that he did not openly emphasize being a Jew. His relation to them he calls his love experience. That is his love to his friends and particu- larly to Eugen. He reminds them that they knew that he always wished to remain a Jew.60 In a letter to Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, dated August 27, 1919, Rosenzweig writes "das ... unaussprechliche Gltick, Jude zu sein," of his inexpressible joy of being a Jew.61 As he arrived in Berlin, he discovered that he could remain a Jew and share love and experiences with his Christian friends. The roots of each one are in his religion, and the treetops can unite. In this way,</page><page sequence="21">From Hegelianism to a Revolutionary Understanding of Judaism 51 he found hope for the future with the possibility of a Jewish-Christian dialogue. Rosenzweig adds in this letter that the greatest Jew for him was Herman Cohen and the greatest Christian was Gritli. A MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE Another letter dating June 15, 1920, that is crucial to our under- standing of Rosenzweig's return to Judaism is addressed to Gritli, Rosenstock-Hussey's wife and Rosenzweig's friend. In it, Rosenzweig is reminiscent of the difficult months in which he pondered the pros and cons of conversion. He describes his return to Judaism as a grace of God and as a long religious experience lasting months. He writes: It is a great act of grace that God has once torn me in my life out of my life. From July to September, 1913 I was quite willing to die, to let everything within myself die. But this cannot become a rule. Most people live simply according to their destiny and their vocation, nothing else. It is extraordinary in us that God, in our case, has not only spoken to us through our lives; but in addition, He has made the life around us fall down, like the wings of a theat- rical decoration, and on the empty stage He has spoken to us. We must know that this is something exceptional and we are not allowed to derive fixed rules out of it.62 Rosenzweig was not embarrassed to speak of religious experiences, yet there is no mention of one occurring on the Day of Atonement. Rosenzweig experienced a prolonged and sad process; the great crisis was an event not of one day but of many weeks and months. In his distress "the stage remained empty." No human being was there to help him. But he felt that he received the support of God. His usage of the plural in the letter can only be explained as pluralis majestatis because he had no company. The world appeared as noth- ing, as wings of the theater that fall away. Rosenzweig felt that it was an act of grace that God spoke to him and strengthened him in his loneliness. In Psalm 23 it says, "The Lord is my shepherd; I lack noth- ing. He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me to water in places of repose; He renews my life; He guides me in right paths as befits His name. Though I walk through a valley of deepest darkness, I fear no harm, for You are with me." CONCLUSION I think that Rosenzweig was one of the greatest figures of the last cen- tury. Scholem, in his article "Thoughts on the Possibility of Mysticism Today," touches on some of the problems we have dealt with here.63</page><page sequence="22">52 Rivka Horwitz He does not mention Rosenzweig by name but speaks in more general terms of unique persons of our time who had a mystical experience that suddenly lit up their world with a new light and a new interpreta- tion when they take in their vision from inner knowledge. Scholem identifies with what we have found in Rosenzweig's writings, that one needs to recognize the "Torah of Heaven" and that without it one can- not reveal novel interpretations. There are seventy faces to the Torah, and one can discover hidden lights in the words of the Torah. In a world of doubt and shadows Rosenzweig taught us that God is alive. He teaches through his philosophy that nothing should remain alien. His knowledge in Kabbala was minimal, but it played an important part in his system. He discovers the myth in the Bible Midrash and Kabbala and displays it in various ways. He returns to the everyday ethical life, as it is said in the conclusion of The Star, quoting Michah: "to do justice and to love mercy and walk humbly with thy God."

The sages made parallels between the members of the human body and the prayer. In Shulhan Aruch- Orach Chaim (61:3), the number of words in "Hear O Israel" is identical to the number of bones in the body. One has to watch for cleanliness, otherwise not all of one's bones can praise God. 29.
