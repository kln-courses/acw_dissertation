GERHARDT In first the fourth of Job's chapter three of friends the book to offer of job, comment, Eliphaz the suggests Temanite, that Job the first of Job's three friends to offer comment, suggests that Job cannot have been a righteous man; otherwise, he would not have incurred so dire a punishment. 4, 7. Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? 8. Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 9. By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 10. The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 11. The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. The "old lion" of v. 1 1 represents the Hebrew word [layish], meaning a lion1 . The Vulgate, however, translates tigris2 : 4, 1 1 . Tigris periit, eo quod non haberet praedam, et catuli leonis dissipati sunt. The Septuagint features in this verse the unusual word fxupfjnqxoXécov : 4, 1 1 .

The purpose of the following pages is to study the various interpretations and observations by which medieval authors have attempted to answer this question. MTPMHKOAEQN, A lion To proceed in good order, it will be necessary to find out first of all what the Greek translator of job may have understood by the word he chose. Now, for all and sundry animals mentioned in the Bible, it still is most rewarding to turn to Samuel Bocharťs hierozoicon1 (1663). In the sixth and last Book of his Second Part, the learned author treats De dubiis vel fabulosis animalibus , among which chapter iv is devoted to the Myrmecoleon . The summary that serves as a chapter-heading admirably sums up the problem as it rested at the time, and takes a firm stand as to what must be considered the most plausible interpretation : MupfA7)xoXe6&gt;v, myrmecoleon , vel formicoleon , Job 4, v. 11: al. animal- culum formicis infestum; al. animal ex formica et leone composi- tum; al. diabolus; al. scarabaei species. Imo leonis genus, Hebraice [lajish]. Huius diserte meminit Agatharchides. Múpfxrjxa vocant Strabo et Aelianus. Hunc cum formicis Indicis confundunt Soliņus et He- liodorus. Leo-formica [xúpjxyjÇ dicitur, quia utrursus [read : ut ursus !j formicis vescitur, aut ab Arabico hirmas , aut a Marmacibus Aethio- piae. Formicae majores in India. S. Bochart, Hierozoicon , 11, col. 813. In the body of the chapter, where all the information then obtainable on the subject is reproduced or referred to, Bochart gives excellent argumentation for his, undoubtedly correct, view that the term [xup(x7j- xoXécov in job 4, 1 1 denotes a kind of lion. He points out that the whole context, vv. 10 and 11, speaks of nothing but lions; that the Hebrew text reads [layish] , one of the words for lion ; and that more than one Greek author uses (xopfjnqxoXécov or [xupfjiYji; to designate the lion. Thus he quotes Agatharchides2 [2d c. B.c.]: "Eorum autem leonum qui vocantur myrmecoleontes , plerique a reliquis nihil differunt . . .", Strabo [c. 63 B.C.- 1 I used: Samuel Bo chart us, Hierozoicon , sive [...] de animalibus S. Scripturae. Lugd. Batavorum et Traj. ad Rhenum, 1707-17 12, 2 vols. The lasting value of Bocharťs work is well brought out in S. V. Carus, Geschichte der Zoologie , München, 1872, p.p. 315-316. See also F. S. Bodenheimer, Animal and man in Bible lands, Leiden, i960, p.p. 3-4. 2 Bochart always gives the original text and a Latin translation ; I quote the latter. 2</page><page sequence="3">19 A.D.]: "Arabiam Trog lody ticam abundare dicit leonibus qui Jormicae vo- cantur . . and Aelianus [c. 200 A.D.]: "Thoum foetus et tigridum catuli vocare soient, Jormicarum item et p anther arumn . The last quotation might just conceivably point to an explanation of the Vulgate rendering tigrisy inasmuch as lions, tigers, fiúpjnqxeç and panthers are here being put more or less on a par. - Among Bocharťs three hypotheses to explain the word-formation, the third deserves mention: Inter leonum species apud Arabes est hirmas, vel hirmis, vel haramis [...]. An hinc factum Graecum (xúp(i.Y)Ç, Sßnali in X mutato , ut in alphabeto Cadmi , et medio M initio addito 1 . Bochart denies any connexion between the (jLupfXTjxoXécov of the Septuagint and the alleged Indian (later: Aethiopian) 4 ants' that dig up and guard nuggets of gold. He refers to a number of authors, from Hero- dotus onward, who have reported on these elusive animals, with which we shall have to deal, if briefly, in this place. The largest amount of documentation on the subject is found in an article by G. Druce2, where numerous passages from classical and Hellenistic writers are summarized. Contrary to Bochart, who believes the creatures to be large ants, Druce concludes, rightly it would seem, that all the descriptions suggest a quadruped mammal of the burrowing kind; as far as I know it still remains unknown to science. Druce does not succeed, however, in making his identification of these quadrupeds with the lions occasionally called [xúpfjiyjxeç or [jiupfnrjxoXéovTeç plausible. And he certainly puts the cart before the horse in speculating that there might have been stories about their backing prey', which would account for the choice of word in the Septuagint as well as for the physiologus chapter to be discussed presently. I think, with Sbordone3, that the gold-digging animals called 'ants' may safely be dismissed from the whole cluster of (jLupfjiYjxoAeov problems. OFFSPRING OF ANT AND LION The various interpretations rejected by Bochart were those which most interested the authors of the first Christian centuries and of the Middle 1 S.

Thus, the 'animal ex formica et leone compositum 9 emerges in the Greek physiologus, the popular moralizing booklet on animals and their, real or imaginary, habits, of which the oldest known recension is generally held to have been constituted in Alexandria during the second century A.D.. Among the forty-eight brief chapters that make up this recension, one chapter (n° 20 in most mss.) is devoted to a supposed hybrid of ant and lion. From Sbordone's edition1, I quote the Greek text in question, together with the corresponding chapter from a recent physiologus translation2.

His chapter 20 is, at any rate, translated from the Greek text printed by Lauchert (op. cit., p. 2^3), not from Sbordone's, which has a slightly more circumstantial moralization. - I could not find the Physiologus translation of F.

Seel) From the Greek, this chapter passed into several Oriental Physiologi2, which translated it with little or no modification, except that sometimes the moralization is given a different turn, viz. that it is no good trying to serve both God and Satan*. The Latin translations, with very few exceptions*, and the later, Latin and vernacular, Bestiaries describe under the same name quite another animal, for reasons we shall presently see. The fabulous creature outlined in the physiologus chapter only the name in common with the lion alluded to in the Septuagini All the same it is evidently inspired by job 4, 1 1 , and particularly by the word [xup(JiY]xoXécov, which was analysed into [xúp[i.7)Ç and Xéoav. This analysis suggested a composite animal, which on account of its hybrid nature might very well 'perish for lack of prey'. Its chief function, however, is to present an embodiment of the moral duplicity reproved in several New Testament passages, notably matth. £, 37, of which the text carries an echo : Žcjtgí $è ó Xóyoç ujjloív * val vai, ou oö. Modern physiologus scholars, besides assembling documentation, which in many cases does not add anything to Bocharťs, have pronoun- ced some rather severe judgments upon this particular fxupfArjxoXécov. Thus for instance Sbordone : "The author of our text arbitrarily creates a new specimen of the mythical * dubia ammalia' that result from the combi- nation of incompatible creatures ; this is an especially shocking case : how are we to imagine half a carnivorous lion whose hind-quarters are those of a vegetarian ant?"* The answer is, no doubt, that we are not to imagine it. The text does not, or hardly, intend us to. 1 Sirach 2, 12-13 (note Sbordone; cf. O. Seel, transi, cit.. note 94). 2 The Aethiopian: see F.

To them, the questions that mattered were: what does the word employed in sacred scripture mean, and what does it signify? The chapter under dis- cussion aimed at answering these questions. It provided the biblical word with a satisfactory meaning that fitted into the context, and brought out its more far-reaching significance by interpreting it figuratively in the light of evangelical teaching. The question as to whether such a creature does, or even can, exist, has come to be of prime importance only in recent times. The medieval answer would have been that God could give off- spring even to an ant and a lion, if He so willed it. The whole of the physiologus does not contain a particle of correct information about animal life, except - and that very rarely - by chance. This being so, the reaction of disbelief and protest on the part of later scholars is justified in its own right, that is to say, on zoo- logical grounds. But, although it deals with animals, the book does not call for a naturalist's approach, least of all a modern one. In order to read it, approximately, as it should be read one has to accept, equally in its own right, the disregard of real conditions and of verisimilitude that was, for many centuries, a normal attitude. The adjustment is perhaps less difficult to make than it would seem. A recent study on the medieval view of the universe gives an enlightening example: "Most of those who helped either by speech or in writing to keep the pseudo- zoology in circulation were not really concerned, one way or the other, with the question of fact; just as today the public speaker who warns me not to hide my head in the sand like an ostrich is not really thinking, and does not want me to think, about ostriches. The mor alitas is what matters."2 The difference lies between the outward-looking eye and the inward- turned mind. A SHORT-LIVED INSECT In modern zoology, the term 'ant-lion' designates an insect, or more particularly its larva, on which medieval writers have ample information to offer, as we shall presently see. Meanwhile, the oldest known text 1 Although, if put to it, they certainly experienced less difficulty in doing so than we should, witness the vivid little hybrids and monsters of medieval art.

The history of this work as well as its manuscript tradition are extremely complicated, and its date of composition cannot be established even approximately2 ; it would seem to be contemporary, in the very broadest sense of the word, with the physiologus. Some of the numerous manuscripts have been published by Mély and Ruelle3, while more recently L. Delatte4 gave a critical edition of an important Latin trans- lation, dated 1 169. The second book of the koiranides is devoted to quadruped animals, among which nevertheless also figure spiders and ants. It is the first paragraph of the chapter on ants that interests us here. Mély- Ruelle offer readings from two Greek manuscripts, Delatte the Latin translation. On account of their slight, but interesting variants, the paragraph will be printed here in all three the texts.

(ibid., p. 294)1 If we gather up the information contained in these three redactions of the paragraph, bracketing those words or sentences that occur in only one of the three, it reads as follows : (The ant is a creature everybody knows.) There are seven species of ants : 1 . the well-known common ant, 2 . the (large) big-headed black ant, 3 . the small thin red ants called oxvítcç [wood-burro w- ers?], 4. the large winged ant, £. the medium-sized field ant, 6. the small ants of the road, 7. the so-called ant-lions, larger (than the others) and spotted, (with wings) ; these are carnivorous, (but) they do not live long. Judged on its own merits, this appears as a perfectly factual bit of natural history, aiming at completeness - the statement that there are seven species of ants is followed by seven descriptions - and at giving the necessary distinctive detail. Nevertheless, the possible relation between the ant-lion described here and the creature of the physiologus has been a matter of some controversy. According to Wellmann2, the koiranides passage suggests a judeo-hellenistic source; the last sentence of the description, as well as the physiologus chapter discussed above, hark back to a Jewish tradition, with which the verse in job as interpreted by the Septuagint translators is also connected. Sbordone3, on the other hand, is convinced that the physiologus served as a source for the, younger, koiranides ; he consequently explains the last sentence as a random interpolation, so curtailed as not to make much sense, borrowed from the physiologus chapter. This latter supposition seems less far-fetched than Wellmann's; but it has since been contended by Perry* that the parallel passages of 1 All additions not in square brackets are by the editors. 2 M.

Nevertheless, //.cit., he supposes a connexion between the fjiuppnqxoXécDV chapter and Alexandrine studies of insect life, as represented in the Koiranides. 4 B. E. Perry, article Physiologus in Pauly- Wissowa's Real- Encyclopédie der class. Altertumswissenschaft, neue Bearb., 39. Halbband, Stuttgart, 1941, col. 1 107. 8</page><page sequence="9">the KOiRANiDES and the physiologus can only be explained by a common source still unknown. However that may be, there is no denying that the three avatars of the (xupfXYjxoXecov we have examined up to now - the lion of the Septuagint, the hybrid of the physiologus, and the insect of the KOiRANiDES - present a kind of fleeting resemblance. This lies not so much in the particulars given about them as in the turn of words, and notably, in the recurring allusion to their death. Yet, to my mind, the texts leave no doubt that the respective writers had three completely different animals (two real, one fabulous) in mind. As regards the koiranides, there remains a question of another order: is the insect here described identical with those that have been labelled ant-lions ( Myrmeleontidae ) by entomologists of later times?1 It may be recalled that in the present sense of the term, an ant-lion is a larva which preys on ants, and has developed a spectacular device for capturing them. It hides on the bottom of a funnel-shaped pit in loose sand, waiting for ants to slide over the edge right into its strong jaws. When the ants try to climb out, it brings them down by quickly steepen- ing the sides of the pit. In wet or otherwise unfavourable periods it buries itself completely under the sand, being able to go for months without food. After metamorphosis a graceful neuropterous insect appears, not unlike a dragon-fly with (in most species) spotted wings, which flies by night, and dies as soon as its eggs have been deposited2. Now the koiranides text defines (xupfj/yjxoXéovTeç as carnivorous ants, but does not specify that they eat other ants, and does not mention the characteristic sand- traps. With some soliciting of the text it is possible to read: "Ant-lions are larger (than other) ants, spotted, winged; [the larva] is carnivorous, but [the adult insect] does not live long". This would fit perfectly, but the general scientific level of the koiranides does not for a moment permit the assumption of a knowledge of the insect's metamorphosis. At best, we might interpret: "The [larva called] ant-lion is larger than an ant, spotted, and [liable to disappear]", which, however, does not account for the word alatae in the Latin translation. On the whole, the identification of the koiranides' all too 1 Wellmann, Sbordone and Perry simply assume that this is so. 2 See: D. J. Borror and D. M.

Still, it does not seem impossible; all the more so as only a few centuries later, a text was to appear that described the myrmicoleon , as an ant-lion, with perfect clarity. TIGER AND ANT-LION, MORALLY Among the definitions of the word myrmicoleon , Bochart mentions in the first place ' animalculum formicis infestum* , for which he refers to St. Gregory's moralia in job1 . In this lengthy work (composed c. £79-58 $), no less than three paragraphs are devoted to the half-verse under dis- cussion. Although not all of them have an equally direct bearing on our subject, they demand to be quoted in full. St. Gregory's exegesis aims at explaining the biblical text according to the moral, the allegorical and, whenever necessary, the literal sense2, so that each verse or half-verse may be treated two or three times over; these different comments are complementary and must be studied jointly. In order to understand the context rightly, it must be remembered that in St. Gregory's interpretation, Job's friends represent heretics. They unjustly crush the blameless sufferer by insidious, but false, arguments, until in the end God himself puts them in the wrong, and they are converted. 4, 1 1 .

Saepe largitate, castitate, pietāte ex pulchra visione induitur, sed interfusa obscuritate superbiae notatur. Sicque ut fit intermistis vitiis dum mundum in se speciem hypocrita non ostendit, quasi unum colorem tigris habere nequaquam possit.

Praeda quippe est, cum aliena violenter auferuntur. Omnis autem hypo- crita, quia vitam justitiae simulans, justorum sibi laudem arripit, alienum profecto est quod tollit. Eliphaz itaque, quia beatum Job incolumi tatis suae tempore lau- danda egisse cognovit, percussione subsequente, haec ilium tenuisse per hypo- crisin credidit, dicens: "Tigris periit, eo quod non haberet praedam". Ac si aperte dicat: Variētas tuae simulationis exstincta est, quia et adulatio ļaudis ablata est ; et jam tua hypocrisis praedam non habet, quia percussus divinitus, hu- manis favoribus caret. Gregorius Magnus, Moralium Libri , v, cap. xx. The author quotes his text according to the Vulgate version, and proceeds at once to expound the moral sense of the word tigris. He starts from the notion that a tiger is spotted (not striped), as it was generally thought to be during the Middle Ages, and occasionally even afterwards1. The tiger's spots signify the vices of the hypocrites, who never succeed in presenting a completely blameless front, because they cannot prevent the hidden blackness from breaking out. This idea is worked out by aid of four examples, carefully built up into a sort of pyramid. The sentences are symmetrically grouped around the antithetic substantives denoting virtues and vices, so balanced and cumulated as to carry superbia ap- propriately on top; the verbs stress the visual element that is essential to the demonstration. The hypocrite's virtues are but outward show and ostentation: extollitur - speciosus ostenditur - decore vestitur - pulchra visione induitur; but the stains of vice are no less apparent : sorde foedatur - maculis inquinatur - fuscatur - interfusa obscuritate notatur. The fourfold repetition of the initial Saepe stresses that such examples are frequently encountered. However, it seems permitted to observe that the true hypocrite is he who, besides displaying virtues, keeps his secret vices well out of sight. St. Gregory, carried away by his tiger, as it were, gives a somewhat tendentious presentation of hypocrisy ; to the modern reader it rather recalls Molière' s Tartuffe, who deceives no one except his simple-minded host and a bigoted old lady. But the commentator firmly drives home his point: it is as impossible for an hypocrite to 1 Isidoras, Etymologiae, xii, ii, 7 : M Tigris . . . bestia variis distincta maculis , virtute et velocitate mirabilis." Still Linnaeus created, or in any case ratified, the name Cypraea tigris for a cowry-shell with con- spicuous black spots. Shakespeare perhaps implies a tiger metaphor where Lysander reviles Demetrius as a 'spotted and inconstant man*. ( Mids . Dream, 1, i). I I</page><page sequence="12">appear wholly pure, as it is for the tiger to be without spots. - There remains the word praeda and its moral sense. As the tiger ravishes his prey, so the hypocrite usurps praise that is not his due. For prey is, in the literal sense, what is forced from others. That is why Eliphaz, having implicitly compared Job to a tiger, adds that it perished for lack of prey. Ac si aperte dicat (St. Gregory's habitual formula for winding up the demon- stration), it is as if he said to Job, in plain words: in your prosperous days you were praised by the world, but now that the deception is ended, men turn away from you. It is apt that Eliphaz should be supposed to attack Job so harshly, since it has already been made clear that he speaks in sin. Through the Old Latin version, which he also employed, St. Gregory knew the alternative reading from the Septuagint, that is to say, the word |xop[X7)xoXécúv. It gets a paragraph to itself, quite on the same level with the Vulgate text1 ; the commentator feels no call to effect a choice between two equally well-authorized renderings of God's word, nor even to express a preference, since the one 'makes sense' as well as the other. 40. Myrmicoleon eos adumbrat qui timidi in fortiores, audaces in parvos sunt. Translatione autem Septuaginta interpretům nequaquam tigris dici tur, sed, "Myr- micoleon periit, eo quod non haberet praedam." Myrmicoleon quippe parvum valde est animal, formicis adversum, quod se sub pulvere abscondit, et formicas frumenta gestantes interficit, interfectasque consumit. Myrmicoleon autem Latine dicitur, vel formicarum leo, vel certe expressius formica pariter et leo. Recte autem formica et leo nominatur, quia si ve volatilibus, seu quibuslibet aliis minu- tis animalibus formica est, ipsis autem formicis leo. Has enim quasi leo devorat, sed ab illis quasi formica devoratur. Cum igitur Eliphaz dicit: * Myrmicoleon periit', quid in beato Job sub myrmicoleontis nomine, nisi pavorem et audaciam reprehendit? Ac si ei aperte dicat: Non injuste percussus es, quia contra erectos timidus, contra subditos audax fuisti. Ac si aperte dicat: Contra astutos te for- mido pressit, contra simplices temeritas inflavit. Sed praedam jam myrmicoleon non habet, quia timida tua elatio dum verberibus premitur, ab aliena laesione prohibetur. Sed quia amicos beati Job haereticorum tenere speciem diximus, urget necessario, ut haec eadem Eliphaz verba quomodo etiam typice sentienda sint intimemus. Gregorius Magnus, Moralium Libri , ibid . As myrmicoleon is a rare word, possibly unknown to his hearers, St. 1 Cf. B. Smalley, op. cit., p. 13: "When the version received by the Church, for Origin the Sep- tuagint, conflicted with other versions, he would not reject the former but would set them side by side and would comment on both. The habit of making double commentaries on double texts without choosing between them will become ingrained." I 2</page><page sequence="13">Gregory begins by explaining the literal sense, in a correct description that has rightly been commended. "An ant-lion is a very small animal, a foe to ants, which hides in the dust and kills the grain-bearing ants and devours them." This is indeed much better zoology than the spotted tiger, and one wonders in passing whether the author got his knowledge from books or, perchance, from observation. The former seems more likely. Already at the time of the koiranides an insect [xupfjnqxoXécov was known and described. St. Gregory's presumable source must nevertheless have been more extensive: 'hiding in the dusť clearly alludes to the sand- traps, and leaves no doubt as to the identity of the animal. Next, a double etymology is proffered to motivate the name. Formicarum leo is ambiguous; 'a lion to ants' would duplicate what follows, so 'a lion among ants' is perhaps preferable. "Or more precisely, at the same time an ant and a lion"; not after the fashion of the physiologus hybrid, but according to the viewpoint of other animals concerned, which is a very neat explication. Birds, for instance, eat it just as if it were an ant, but ants are eaten by it, so that it is to them what a devouring lion is to us. The moral sense of this intermediate status also rests on relativity and interrelations: by referring to the ant-lion, Eliphaz obliquely accuses Job of cringing before the great while intimi- dating the humble. But also this ant-lion lacks prey, now that Job is no longer in a position to do harm to others. The commentator ends his double exposition by announcing that this is not all: it remains for him to explain how Eliphaz' words, all the more so as they come from a heretic, must be understood according to the typical, or allegorical, sense. This interpretation, where tiger and ant-lion are taken together (along with the lions of the preceding verse) is found two chapters further on. It is linked up with an existing tradition, which we shall have to recall preliminary to the text of St. Gregory. SATAN Bochart, in surveying the misconceptions to which the word used in the Septuagint has given rise, also mentions the allegorical explanation that simply takes myrmicoleon to be a name for the devil. Sunt qui animal huius nominis ullum extare negent : Olympiodorus [6th c. ad] in Jobum [...]. Proinde ad allegorias confugiunt , et mjrmecoleontis nomine diabolum intellegunt , ut qui cum leone quaedam , et cum formica quaedam habeat communia , quod rursus 13</page><page sequence="14">varie exponunt. Eulogius Alexandrinus [...]; Augustinus in Jobum [...]; Beda in Jobum [...]. Contra , Olympiodorus diabolum vult esse piis quidem formica, impiis vero leonem1 . Among the authorities quoted by Bochart, the one which carried most weight during the Middle Ages certainly was St. Augustine. The passage in question is found in his annotationes in job2, which consist of one Book, covering the whole biblical text except for the last chapters. "Myrmicoleon perit eo quod non haberet escam": quia in novissimo non erunt, quos inducens comedat; separabuntur enim pii ab inpiis. Hic autem errat, quod ea quae de diabolo audierat prophetata de Job intelligebat. [sc. Eliphaz.] Myrmico- leon vero accipiendus est vel quia utrumque in eo est, cum et rapit et occulte persequitur frumenta, quae sublato oculo facit non germinare, vel quia avaris et in terra thesaurizantibus dominatur, vel quia iustos persequitur quasi formicas praeparantes sibi esca s aestate ad hiemem, quibus non pasce tur, cum boni ab inpiis fuerint separati. Augustinus, Annotationes in Job , ad cap. 4. To St. Augustine, the operative word of the half-verse evidently is perii, understood as a prophecy referring to the devil. The word myrmicoleon therefore has to designate the devil, as can be explained in three different ways. Satan ravishes (his prey), but also furtively steals the grain (of good works) and causes it to remain infertile ; he reigns over those who industriously amass wealth on earth; he persecutes the just who are provident and lay up (spiritual) treasures. - These arguments seem a little confused. The difference between the avari and the justi is implied rather than clearly brought out, and there is a suggestion of disparaging the well-known exemplary activities of the ant : gathering food in harvest- time3, biting the grains in two to prevent them from sprouting*. How- ever, the general idea is made plain : the mysterious myrmicoleon is Satan, who in the end will be balked of his prey. As might be expected, St. Gregory too adopts the application of the verses 4, 10/ 11 to Satan, who for a variety of reasons may rightly be called a lion, a tiger and an ant-lion. 4, 1 1 . Tigris peri it, eo quod non haberet praedam , et catuli leonum dissipati sunt. 43. Satan et leo recte vocatur, et tigris et myrmicoleon. Hunc vocábulo tigridis repetit quem leonis appellatione significavit. Satan quippe 1 S. Bochart, op. cit., 11, cols. 814-81^. 2 Migne, Pat. Lat., xxxiv, 825-886. Paris, 1887. See also: S.

Pliny, Natural history , Lib. xi, cap. xxxvi, 109. It has never been shown that ants do this, although they will chew their grain into a paste. 14</page><page sequence="15">et propter crudelitatem leo dicitur, et propter multiformis astutiae varietatem non incongrue tigris vocatur. Modo enim se sicut est perdi tus humanis sensibus objicit, modo quasi angelům lucis ostendit. Modo stul torum mentes blandiendo persuadet, modo ad culpam terrendo pertrahit. Modo suadere vi tia aperte nititur, modo in suis suggestionibus sub virtutis specie palliatur. Haec itaque bellua, quae tanta varietate respergitur, jure tigris vocatur, quae apud Septuaginta interpretes, ut praefati sumus, myrmicoleon dicitur. Quod videlicet animal absconsum pulvere, formicas, ut diximus, frumenta gestantes interficit; quia nimirum apostata angelus in terram de caelis projectus, justorum mentes, quae bonorum sibi operum re- fectionem praeparant, in ipso actionis itinere obsidet; cumque eas per insidias superat, quasi formicas frumenta gestantes improvisus necat. Recte autem myrmi- coleon, id est, leo et formica dicitur. Formicis enim, ut diximus, leo est, volatili- bus formica, quia nimirum antiquus hostis sicut contra consentientes fortis est, ita contra resistentes debilis. Si enim eius suggestionibus assensus praebetur, quasi leo tolerari nequaquam potest; si autem resistitur, quasi formica atteritur. Aliis ergo leo est, aliis formica; quia crudelitatem illius carnales mentes vix tolerant, spiri tales vero infirmitatem illius pede virtutis calcant. Haeretici igitur, quia de sanctitatis praesumptione superbiunt, quasi exsultantes dicunt: 'Myrmicoleon', vel certe 'tigris', 'periit, eo quod non haberet praedam'. Ac si aperte dicant: Vetustus adversarius in nobis praedam non habet, quia quantum ad nostra studia iam victus jacet. Idcirco autem myrmicoleontis appel- latione vel tigridis repetitur, qui jam contrito leonis rugitu fuerat designatus, quia quidquid per gaudium dicitur, saepe replicatur. Voces quippe ingeminat animus cum exsultat. linde et veraci laetitiae Psalmista crebro repetit hoc, quod se exauditum esse cognovit, dicens: Exaudivit Dominus vocem fletus mei ; exaudivit Dominus deprecationem meam , Dominus orationem meam assumpsit. (Ps. 6, 9/10). Gregorius Magnus, Moralium Libri , v, cap. xxii. Satan as a tiger is characterized again by the variety of his wiles ; as an ant-lion, by his treacherous slaying of the grain-bearing ants, the justi , who are laying up spiritual provision through good works. (St. Augustine's incipient confusion is firmly put right.) Still, if he remains a lion to those who yield, those who resist will find him as harmless as an ant ; the godly will be able to crush him under foot. This is more or less a repetition, in another key, of what has already been set forth in the earlier paragraphs. But now St. Gregory ends by reminding his audience that the whole biblical passage carries, as it were, a negative sign. It is the heretic Eliphaz who asserts that the roaring of the lion is broken and that the tiger has perished for lack of prey. He and his fellows think so highly of their own righteousness that they boast of having vanquished the old adversary. Their confident mood explains the repetitions of the verses 1 o and 1 1 , for, as the commentator rightly observes, repeating the same words is the sign of a rejoicing spirit. An example from the psalms is adduced to illustrate this stylistic point.</page><page sequence="16">But at the same time, the verax laetitia of the Psalmist is implicitly oppos- ed to Eliphaz' vain presumption. That St. Gregory should have been so remarkably well-informed on the behaviour of the ant-lion is a curious detail, of some interest to the history of zoology. The intrinsic value of his chapters lies, though, in the competent moralizing, which carries a conviction of its own. His moral interpretation - the ant-lion in pursuit of the weak, in fear of the strong - as well as his allegorical reference to Satan waylaying the just, are coherent, immediately intelligible, and in their way instructive. Even though these and similar medieval proceedings have become obsolete as a mode of reading the Bible, viewed as sheer intellectual exercise they still may command admiration and respect. On the other hand, the medieval penchant for seeking in nature spiritual and moral lessons based on supposed parallels to human con- duct has lasted well into modern times ; survivals of it occur even to the present day. In particular, the habit of applying notions of good and evil to animal behaviour dies hard with us all. In this respect it is inter- esting to note that the very ant-lion has continued to incur the reproach of cruelty and devilish cunning. One of its first modern observers, the great Réaumur, found his captive ant-lions "quelquefois sensibles au cruel plaisir de tuer plus pour faire preuve d'adresse ou de force, que pour appaiser leur faim"1 . Druce declares that "the ant-lion in nature is a wicked creature, and its method of capturing its prey diabolical"2. And a fairly recent monograph on the subject bears the title Demons of the Dust*. Allegory or mere conceit, the association of ideas is, as we saw, of venerable antiquity. TOWARDS A SCIENCE OF NATURE As Bochart shows, it was St. Gregory's definition that settled the meaning of the word myrmicoleon for later European authors. Under the latinized form Jormicoleon, it was included in Isidore of Sevilla's etymologiae* (early 7th c.) and from there started on a career that runs through the whole of the Middle Ages. Isidore, whether he knew ant-lions or not, 1 M. de Réaumur, Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des insectes , t. VI, Paris, 1742, p. 3^9. 2 G. Druce, art. cit., p. 363. 3 See above, p. 9, note 2. The author states: "the word 'demon' is here used metaphorically and in the modern sense of a 'malevolent being' .[...] The patron-demon of the creatures considered in this book is the ancient prototype of Satan, Set, whom the Egyptians [ . . .] believed to be personified in all desert animals." (p. 40). 4 Isidorus Hispalensis, Etimologi arum sire Originum libri xx ; ree. W. M. Lindsay. Oxford, 1957, 2 vols. l6</page><page sequence="17">must have liked the word for the transparency it had acquired thanks to St. Gregory's exegesis; while reproducing the very terms of his con- temporary, he makes as much as possible of the formica ¡leo interplay. Formicoleon est ob hoc vocatus, quia est vel formicarum leo vel certe formica pariter et leo. Est enim animal parvum formicis satis infestum, quod se in pulvere abscondit, et formicas frumenta gestantes interficit. Proinde autem leo et formica vocatur, quia aliis animalibus ut formica est, formicis autem ut leo est. Isidorus, Etymologiae , xii, iii, io. The same aspect - that is to say, the word-formation rather than the animal itself- interested the learned Aldhelmof Malmesbury (c. 640-709), who devoted one of his enigmata ex diversis rerum creaturis composita1 to the ant-lion. Myrmicoleon Dudum compositis ego nomen gesto figuris : Ut leo, sic formica vocor sermone Pelasgo Tropica nominibus signans praesagia duplis, Cum rostris avium nequeam resistere rostro. Scrutetur sapiens, gemino cur nomine fungar ! Aldhelmus, Enigmata , n° xvm. Aldhelm knew Greek; linguistically speaking, the name myrmicoleon had no secrets for him. So he stresses its metaphorical value, for the reader to puzzle over. His lines veil the object as well as the term in a haze of mystery, suited to the genre he chose to cultivate, but no doubt some- what bewildering even to those who recognized his sources. As a provider of data on animals, it is not before the thirteenth century that Aldhelm emerges again, misnamed Adelinus, in the work of Thomas of Can- timpré. In the meantime, authors were content with reproducing the ant- lion description that reached them through two works so famous and so widely read as the moralia in job and the etymologiae. This double source occasionally gave rise to a double treatment. Hrabanus Maurus, in his de universo2 (c. 844) gives myrmicoleon in a chapter on (four- footed) beasts, as a sort of supplement to tigris ; in the next chapter, on small creatures, he inserts formicoleon. For the first, the text is copied from St. Gregory, for the second, from Isidore. If the author realized that he was describing the same animal twice, he gives no sign of it. 1 Aldhelmus, De metris et enigmatibus ac pedum regulis , in Opera, ed. R. Ehwald, Berlin, 19 19, pp. 59-204. ( M.G.H., Auct. Ant., iç). 2 Rabanus Maurus, De Universo libri xxii. Migne, Pat. Lat., CXI, Paris, 1852. (see col. 219 and col. 227.) 17</page><page sequence="18">In the 12th-century treatise de bestiis et aliis rebus1, formerly attributed to Hugh of St. Victor2, the reproduction of Isidore's text appears a little wavering. Either it was one of the innumerable copyists of the ETYMOLOGiAE, or the author of de bestiis, who felt impelled to introduce some improvements of his own: a subjunctive, a simplifi- cation of the final etymology. Est et aliud animal, quod formicaleon dicitur, quod est vel formicarum leo, vel certe formica pari ter et leo. Est enim animal parvum, formicis ita infestum, ut se in pulvere abscondat, et formicas frumenta gestantes interficiat. Proinde leo et formica vocatur, quia sicut aliis animalibus leo, ita formicis aliis haec fortior est. De bestiis, il, cap. 29. On the whole, until the end of the twelfth century there is singularly little variation in ant-lions. The Bestiaries, which derive from the physio logus with, most often, a generous admixture of Isidore's ETYMOLOGiAE, contribute proof that the original conception of the Greek physiologus chapter had come to be eclipsed by the St. Gregory- Isidore tradition. The reason is probably that European authors consider- ed the latter as better authenticated, and not, that they preferred the less fantastic animal. Most Bestiaries, whether in Latin or in the ver- nacular (as, for instance, the early 12th-century Anglo-Norman besti- aire of Philippe de Thaon), insert at the end of the chapter on ants the ant-lion and the gold-digging 'ants', both after Isidore. In either case the descriptions suggest a half-fabulous creature, whose existence is mainly a matter of hearsay. It is, of course, in the great encyclopedic writers of the thirteenth century that one would expect to find new views on the subject. Michael Scot's (indirect) translation of the zoological works of Aristotle, soon followed by the compendium of Avicenna, gave a new impulse to nature study3. Had Aristotle happened to describe the ant-lion, his words 1 De bestiis et aliis rebus libri iv; ( Appendicis ad Hugonis Opera Dogmatica continuano). Migne, Pat. Lat., CLXXVII, Paris, 1879. 2 The question of its authorship has not, as far as I know, been settled, except for the attribution of Book I to Hugh of Fouilloy ; cf. F.

But this was not the case ; consequently, authors were left to their own devices for improving as best they could upon the familiar source-material. Particularly enterprising is Bartholomaeus Anglicus, whose de rerum propriet Atibus1 (c. 1 240) is now generally considered as the earliest of the 13th-century encyclopedias. In the eighteenth Book, which treats various animals in alphabetical order, there is an item De formicaleone: Formicaleon a formica et leone recepit denominai ionem, ut dicit Isido. Lib. 27, formica est et leo. Est enim animal parvum formicis infestum. Nam furtive earum promptuaria subintrans, granum comedi t formicarum, et sic per subtractionem victus, causa est quare simplices formicae in fine necessario moriuntur. Ab aliis autem animalibus devorantur, ut formica, nec potest [sic] se propriis viribus contueri ; et est species araneae. Quaere supra de aranea in litera A. Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De rerum proprietatibus , xvin, cap. Iii. I am unable to explain how Bartholomew came to misread Isidore's perfectly clear description in this way, or wherever he might have picked up the idea of an ant-lion that eats grain and causes the poor ants to die of starvation. It might be due to an unfortunate marginal gloss, or possibly to a recollection of St. Augustine's comments, which hint at the stealing of grain2. The addition et est species araneae looks like an afterthought; apparently, the author collected new information on spiders when the ant-lion chapter was already finished and in place. The long chapter on spiders, which is, on the whole, excellent, has for its chief authorities Aristotle and Avicenna, supplemented by Pliny. Bartholomew's avid reading of the latter caused him, however, to commit an error that confuses the issue still more. Est etiam aliud genus araneae nomine Mirmicaleon sive Mirmiceon, quod alio nomine dicitur formicaleon, formicae similis capite albo, habens nigrum corpus, distinctum maculis albis, cuius morsus vesparum dolore torquet, et dicitur for- micaleon, quia formicas venatur ut leo, et earum sugunt [sic] humiditatem, sed a passeribus devorantur et ab aliis avibus ut formica. Bartholomaeus Anglicus, ibid.y cap. x. A biting spider named myrmecion is indeed mentioned by Pliny, not in the book on 'insects', but in one of the books on remedies^. It is under- 1 Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De genuinis rerum coelestium , terrestrium et inferarum proprietatibus libri xvin. [...]. Francofurti, 1601 .

Thus he turned out a composite paragraph which combines Pliny's data with a reminiscence - correct this time - of the traditional ant-lion descriptions. What escaped him is the contradiction with his own formicaleon chapter. This is quite in charac- ter : the whole of his work gives the impression that he was too alert and eager to be always accurate. Chronologically1, we now come to Thomas of Cantimpré, whose de NATURis rerum is, strange to say, still unavailable in any printed edition, old or modern. One may turn to his translators, Jacob van Maerlandt and Conrad von Megenberg2. Moreover, a great deal of his work is reproduced in quotation by his contemporary Vincent of Beauvais. Thus, Thomas' information on the ant-lion is found there nearly in full3 . Vincent of Beauvais was, in the first place, a compiler; he aimed at making his speculum maius* a reference-book so complete that it would, as it were, represent a whole library5. The method of his work, for which he enlisted the aid of numerous collaborators, is well illus- trated by the chapter De formicaleone . IsiáoTus.

Qui dum adhuc parvus est et invalidus robore, pacem ac modestiam simulât, sed cum vires acceperit, prístina consortia despicit, et unam maiorum turbam comitatur. Itaque invalescens audacia, formicis ad usus convenientes laborantibus insidias delitescit, et qui sibi nihil in aestate paraverat, in hyeme labores earum diripit ac destruit. Vincentius Bellovac., Speculum naturale , xx, cap. cxxxv. The modern reader may find this way of writing a book depressing. The matter in hand is not carried any further by the uncritical juxtaposition of conflicting data (the ant-lion is said now to be small, now large; now to eat ants, now grain), while it seems rather superfluous to quote once more such well-known authors as Isidore and St. Gregory. But the ideal of the speculum was a cumulative, not a critical one;, it was to represent the sum of knowledge amassed up to then on any given subject. To a large extent, it has filled this purpose. Yet, lacking as it was in new data and synthetic views, it exercised hardly any influence on the. progress of medieval science. Even, Vincent's ambition defeated itself, in so far as the enormous bulk of his work was an obstacle to its dif- fusion. The previous attempts by Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Thomas of Cantimpré met with greater success; their encyclopedias, more compactly planned and less costly to multiply, came to be widely used. As regards the contribution, in Vincent's text, by Thomas of Cantimpré, this renovated ant-lion definitely falls into the category 4 histoire naturelle romancée'. Embroidering upon what he had read1, Thomas endows the animal with malignant gifts for scheming and trickery ; he ends up by suggesting that, having been improvident all summer, it lives in winter at the expense of the ants, pillaging and destroying the fruit of their labours. All this looks like sheer personal fancy, influenced perhaps by Bartholomew or, again, by a reminiscence from St. Augustine. The author's proposed aim seems to have been not so much a contribution to natural history as a moral pointer: even those harmless and praiseworthy creatures, the ants, have their insidious enemies. Ponder this fact, and it will yield more than one moralitas2. 1 The definition vermis de genere formicarum , sed multo maior , might conceivably go back to the Koiranides , which Thomas knew (in the translation of 1 1 69) and frequently used : Carus, op. cit., p. 2 2 1 . 2 Thomas himself moralizes (in Pitra's text) : Hoc genus animalium significai hipócritas et dolosos in claustro. Jacob van Maerlandt ( loc.cit .): Dus doen verdorvene edelinghe / Diene doene ghene neringhe... Konrad von Megenberg (loe. cit.) : Pei dem Wurm verste die müeziggängel , die den arbaitern nihts lâzent irs swaizes und irr arbait. Cf. Petrus Berchorius, Reductorium Morale , Coloniae Agrippinae, 1731, Lib. X, cap. vii (De aranea ), 18: a succinct description of the ant-lion, based on Bartholomew and Thomas, is followed by a lengthy moralization, in which this kind of 'spider' is explained as mali praelatiy or, as the case may be, ballivi , who despoil the poor, but in their turn will be crushed by vigilant princes. 21</page><page sequence="22">Turning, lastly, to the vast zoological work of Albertus Magnus, we see the knowledge of ant-lions suddenly advance with a bound. This progress appears all the more spectacular for the minuteness of the subject, in comparison with the impressive scope of the de animalibus1 . In the last Book, which describes in alphabetical order the small in- vertebrates then still lumped together as vermes , our insect gets the following paragraph: Formicaleon dicitur leo formicarum qui alio nomine murmycaleon vocatur. Hoc enim animal non est primo formica ut quidam dicunt. Expertus enim sum multo- tiens et ostendi sociis hoc animal engulas fere habere figuram et absconditur in sábulo, semisperam in sábulo fodiens cuius polus est os formicaleonis : et dum formicae causa lucri transeunt, ipsa s capit et devorat et hoc saepius aspeximus. - In hieme etiam dicitur cibos formicarum diripere eo quod in aestate nichil congregat sibi. - Filomenae etiam avidissime legunt formicas et ova earum çt ex illis convalescunt infirmae. Albertus Magnus, De animalibus , xxvi, cap. 16. What is new here is the attitude, as natural to present-day scientists as it was unfamiliar to medieval scholars, expressed by those verbs that are in the first person : expertus enim sum multotiens . . . ostendi sociis . . . et hoc saepius aspeximus . At last, a learned man has been looking at ant- lions instead of merely looking them up in books. A first result is the rejection of a long-standing error: the animal is not, "as some say", an ant. According to Albertus' observation it much resembles a tick2. If this is not a very apt comparison, it is largely compensated by the remarkably correct description of the sand-pit. The question of the animal's activities is settled once and for all : it catches ants and devours them, "we have more than once watched them doing so". Nevertheless, a previous authority - clearly Thomas of Cantimpré, as the verb diripere shows3 - is quoted in addition, perhaps to answer the unspoken question as to what ant-lions do live on in winter. But this dubious information gets a prudent dicitur , which sets it apart from the author's first-hand knowledge. - The last sentence apparently serves to repair an omission higher up; it ought to have figured in the foregoing paragraph (Formica), 1 Albertus Magnus, De animalibus libri xxvi ; nach der Kölner Urschrift hrsg. von H. Stadler. Münster i9i6-*2o, 2 vols. 2 Engulas , the tick, is described at the end of the preceding chapter: Engulas vermis est ex re nomen habens quia totum caput et guiam sanguini quod semper sugit , immergit et tantum trahit quod crepat; et ad- baeret labiis luporum et canum et vocatur a quibusdam pediculus silvae , vulgariter autem theca vocatur. s On Albertus' using the work of Thomas of Cantimpré - and not the reverse - see P. Aiken, The Animal History of Albertus Magnus and Thomas of Cantimpré , in Speculum , 22 = 1947, pp. 2oç-22ç. 22</page><page sequence="23">but finds a place hereby means of a connecting etiam: nightingales, too, are fond of eating ants. That our investigation should end on such a remarkable item is more or less a stroke of luck; that is to say, not all of Albertus' work attains the level of this particular paragraph. He by no means always verified his data in the manner displayed here, and took over a good many errors from his predecessors, even to Thomas of Cantimpré's mis- readings of Pliny. Nevertheless, his de animalibus leaves all earlier animal books (with the exception of Frederick the Second's work on falconry) far behind. Albertus was the first to grasp the subject in its entirety and to concentrate upon larger issues instead of merely gathering stray descriptions and curiosities. He certainly prepared the way for the zoological studies of the sixteenth century. As to the ant-lion, it still bears the name of the biblical (jii)p(XY]xoXécov, which was the primary cause of its attracting so much attention. Even though the term was never meant to designate an insect in the first place, and though the insect itself provoked a great deal of mistaken information and anthropomorphic comment, it may be said that medieval nature study shows rather to advantage in this instance. Not many small animals have been so correctly determined and described at such an early date ; nor, for that matter, are there many so aptly named. Utrecht, Oudwijkeilaan 21 23</page></plain_text>
