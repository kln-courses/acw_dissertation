Sa'd b. Ibrahim al-Khabbaz who received the work through three intermediate links from the author. The following</page><page sequence="3">ZIAUDDIN AHMAD 99 statement relates to a second reading of the book, part by part, before one Abu'1-Ghan?'im 'Abd Al-Rahm?n b. J?mi\ in Muharram, 577 A.H. Among the persons appearing in the chain of authority, the first three men were of great fame. Abu Ish?q al-Barmak? (d. 445/1055?6), a Hanbal! teacher at J?mV al-Mans?r in Baghdad had Ij?za from * Abd al-'Aziz Ghul?m al-Khall?l who transmitted the work from al-Khall?l. The other names occuring in the statements could not be found out in the available sources. The version ^ scribed towards the end of the first state ment gives the impression that the scribe has made an exact copy from the original work. It is not known whether the original copy belonged to the author, or to any of the transmitters. It is, however, evident that the scribe copied exactly what he found in the original work without any temptation to rectify even the simple grammatical errors. Abu Bakr al-Khall?l , known as the compiler of the teachings of Im?m Ahmad b. flanbal: Jr^ ! u^J^I belonged to the second generation of the Han?bila.3 He studied under a large number of Ahmad b. Hanbal's desciples of whom Ab? Bakr al-Marr?dh? (d. 275/888?89) was his principal teacher. The scanty data on al-Khall?l's life indicate that he undertook the difficult task of collecting the teachings of Ibn Hanbal which he left scattered with a large number of his followers. It was perhaps al-Marr?dh? who encouraged al-Khall?l to undertake long journeys to collect the Mas?'il of the Im?m from his desciples. It seems that al-Khall?l's strenuous efforts made the teachings of the great Im?m to survive from generation to generation. According to Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Khall?l compiled the teachings and opinions of Ibn Hanbal in a book entitled al-J?mV al-Kab?r comprising twenty volumes.4 To al-Khat?b al-Baghd?d?, al-Khall?l devoted his energies in collecting the ' Ilm of Ibn Hanbal for which he undertook journeys, wrote down what he received from both first hand and second hand sources and finally compiled them in many books.5 The work under reference, although named as Kit?b al-Musnad, should not be confused with the encyclopaedic collection of traditions by</page><page sequence="4">100 AN IMPORTANT HANBALI WORK Ibn rjanbal himself known as his Musnad. While containing a large number of Traditions, the present work has for its main object the views and utterances of the Imam in great detail in his own words on the religio political and dogmatic controversies which had been raging upto his time i.e. the middle of the third century of the Hijra. The opinions of the Imam are generally based on and supported by the verses of the Qur'?n the tra ditions of the Prophet and the precepts of his companions and also of the T?b??n. Repetition of traditions and other statements are frequent, although in most places with variations in the Sanad and the Main (text). Besides the statements ascribed to the Im?m. there will be found many versions, also supported by traditions, by both contemporary and early scholars. As is the practice of early Muslim scholars, especially the Muhaddith?n in the transmission of knowledge, each and every statement, irrespective of its being a tradition from the Prophet or from successors, is preceded by a Sanad (chain of authorities). Sources which provide information on the work of al-Khall?l or Ibn Hanbal give no indication of any of their works under the above title. Some Orientalists tend to believe that the present work forms a part of the celebrated al-J?mV al-Kab?r of Khall?l comprising twenty volumes and probably sub-divided into 200 parts.6 But in view of the non-existence of this great encyclopaedic work, it is very difficult to consider the above opinion as fully conclusive. The extant fragments or titles attributed in our sources to al-Khall?l are also of little help in this respect.7 However, another work of al-Khall?l, which also is not extant, entitled Kit?b al-Sunna, seems to have some similar contents with those in the present work which deals with all the dogmatic views of Ibn Hanbal in a very great detail in his own words. According to Ibn Taymiyya, the above Kit?b al-Sunna by al-Khall?l is the fullest possible source for a knowledge of Ibn HanbaPs dogmatic views.8 Both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim have profusely used the above Kit?b al-Sunna for the preparation of some of their theological discourses.9 Al-Dhahab?, a Hanbal? scholar of great repute, also quotes from this work in some of his treatises, 0 It is curious that in the present work there can be found many versions fully identical, without the slightest variation in the text and even in the Sanad, with similar versions recorded by all the above thne scholars</page><page sequence="5">ZIAUDDIN AHMAD 101 in their works. According to al-Dhahab?, however, al-Khall?Ps Kit?b al-Sunna comprised three volumes. 1 It is, then, likely that our Ms., if one may like to take it as the same Kit?b al-Sunna, was found in three volumes when al-Dhahab? used it, because, our work deals with almost all the topics that are usually discussed in works of similar nature. To add further, in some sources we also come across a number of quotations having been attributed to al-Khall?l's . al-Sunna, but these are not found in the present work.*2 Ihn HanbaFs Kit?b al-Radd 'ala al-Jahmiyya^ transmitted by al-Khall?l himself is also missing in our work. In view of the above facts, one can, therefore, conjecture that in the present work some fragments of the Kit?b al-Sunna by the same author might be missing. From a seal affixed on folio 3a above the title of the Ms., it appears that the work was in the possession of one Yunis. The seal reads thus : ij^ji ^ ^' &lt;S.Ul j?ljJI . Subsequently it might have been owned by one Mawl?na Khair al-Din b. Khalil (written in different ink below the title) who was probably a seller of revenue stamps ( J^ji : Pulce) 2 a. Both the seal and the above name indicate that the Ms. was possibly in Turkish hands. Nothing could be discovered from the British Museum records to shed light on this question. On October 27,1883, the British Museum bought it from Henry George Keene who acquired it from Henry Engleheart on January 21,1835. Henry Engleheart and Cams Cole appear to have acquired it on November 11,1821. The work, according to subject matter, may be divided into two broad parts. Fols 3b?86b (PP. 1?240 of the printed edition), excluding fols. 21a?38b (PP. 51?99), concerns the political controversies of early Islam, viz. the questions of Khil?fa and Im?ma, the legitimacy of the first four Caliphs and Mu' ?wiya for Caliphate, Khaw?rij, Raw?fid and certain other relevant matters. This part provides us with extensive information on the trend of the development of Sunnism and Shi'ism which started with a mere political controversy and culminated into theological antagonism and which greatly influenced the subsequent history of Islam. In this part of the work, as might be expected, Ahmad b. Hanbal, being a great Imam of Ahl al-Sunna, upheld the general Sunni position on</page><page sequence="6">102 AN IMPORTANT HANBALI WORK almost all the relevant controversies. It is, however, significant that in a number of problems the Imam appears somewhat inclined towards a moderate view and sometimes he took almost a different position. For example, besides the R?fidn* view of All's superiority to other Companions including the first three Caliphs, there appear to have prevailed a number of opinions among his Sunn? predecessors them selevs. According to some, Ab? Bakr and * Umar commanded a position superior to that of all other Companions including 4 Uthm?n and * All in respect of whom silence was observed. Yet there were a group of people who considered 4 All superior to * Uthm?n, but not superior to the first two Caliphs, 5 The present work discusses these opinions in great detail in the words of Ibn Hanbal whose own view appears to have been somewhat different. The Im?m considered the question in two perspectives, personal merit and the Caliphate. Refuting all the prevailing opinions with the aid of traditions and also by seeking an indication from the Prophet or his Companions the Im?m held that4 AK was not at par in excellence with the first three Caliphs, eventhough he did not clearly give the fourth place to 4 All while not objecting to those who wanted ' All to be given the fourth place in respect of merits ; this the Im?m considered yet to be in conformity with the Sunna.*6 Political rivalries between the * Alid's, the 4 Umayy?ds and the 4 Abbasids seem to have made Ibn Ilanbal to adopt this course. Al-Khall?l comments that Ibn Hanbal's consent to give 4 AH the fourth place in respect of merits, although he himself held a different opinion, was motivated by his desire of treading a middle way between the two extreme views, so that the Ahl al-Sh?m (Umayy?ds) might not invoke his support in their cause.*7 In discussing the question of Khilafa, Ibn Hanbal appears to have unequivocally upheld the legitimacy of their Im?ma in their respective order. He was very cautious in his remarks about' All's opponents and does not appear to have made any claim that there was Ijm?* in support of4 All's Caliphate. He sought his authority in the rather partial public support commanded by 4All and also on the basis of some traditions. He also did not consider the persons who questioned the legitimacy of 4AlFs Khil?fa</page><page sequence="7">ZIAUDDIN AHMAD 103 as violators of the creed of Ahl al-Sunna. To him, they were rather mis guided in their judgement. In his opinion, however, 4 AH was the worthiest man for the Caliphate after 'Uthm?n.i* Some sources inform us that Ihn ?lanbal considered Mu'?wiya and his followers as rebels (^k ) against 'All. While discussing al-Sh?fiTs formulation of laws relating to rebels on the analogy of the measures taken by 'Ali against Mu'?wiya, the Imam commented that, among the Compa nions of the holy Prophet, Mu'?wiya was driven to revolt. 9 But this work informs us that Mu'?wiya was not to be regarded as rebel; he was rather misguided in his judgement.20 In a version the Im?m even refused to acknowledge the authority of the statement : The just Im?m were only five the four Caliphs and 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Az?z.2* Many a times the Im?m harshly criticised some of his pre decessors for compiling narratives relating to the differences among the Companions. His moto was : " I do not like any one to write down these narratives in which the Companions of the Prophet have been dis paragingly mentioned. They neither concern Flal?l and tfar?m, nor the Sunna of the Holy Prophet. You must learn the Sunna, the Fiqh and what will benefit you".22 It will be seen in this work that Ahmad b. flanbal, unlike many of his predecessors who attributed even Kufr to the Rawqf??l and the Khaw?rij, held a rather belanced opinion about them. To him, the Iman of the Raw?fi4 was rather weak.23 With regard to the Khaw?rij, the Imam refused to hold any opinion beyond what the Prophet is related to have said in a tradition that they will stray from the path of the faith ( ??j+i Cr?) .24 This work also gives us ample information about the attitude of the Contemporary and early traditionists towards certain Umayyad personalities, such as M?lik al-Ashtar, Marw?n b. al-Hakam Yaz?d b. Mu'?wiya and al-Hajj?j b. Y?suf.25 Under the part : Fad?'il al-Nabiyy of our work (fols. 21a?38b, pp 51?99), at the beginning of which some rare qualities of the Prophet have been discussed, a long chapter has been introduced under the</page><page sequence="8">104 AN IMFORTANT HANBALI WORK heading :" Dhikr al-Maq?m al-Mahm?d." This refers to the verse: \sy?9iA Lliu uioj fS?Juj, ! (17 :81) The exegets almost unanimously held f &amp;JI to mean metaphorically Maq?m al-Shaf?'a al-Kubra, a sphere where theProph^t would have the honour of universal intercession for his Umma on the Day of Resurrection. But certain traditions (not from the Prophet), especially that of Muj?hid. were given to interpret f ^Jl " as the 'Throne of God : 'Arsh'* on which the Prophet would be seated beside Him on the Day of Resurrection.26 This is clearly an anthropomorphic version, and is unacceptable particularly to the Mu'tazilites. The Hanbalis who were laterly called as Hashwiya, and sometimes Mujassima,11 would inevitably oppose them. So far as it may be surmised from the Chapter under reference, it appears that a serious controversy was prevailing between the upholders of the above mentioned two theories regarding al-Maq?m al-Mahm?d. It seems that after the death of Ibn Hanbal, the problem of al Maq?m al-Mahm?d became a much disputed issue between his followers and a certain ' Tirmidhi ' who opposed their interpretation of the above verse. Ibn Hanbal, however, himself does not appear to have had any part in this controversy, except that his general opinion was to take such verses in their literal sense. Folios 94a?152b (PP. 262?437) of our work contains views of Ahmad b. Hanbal in a very great detail on Im?n, its increase and decrease, the meaning of Isl?m and some other related problems. His views are entirely directed against the Murjites and the early Hanafites. Some references to other individuals will also be found occasionally. It will appear that ' Abd All?h b. Mas'?d, a Companion of the Prophet and one of the fore-runners of the Hanaf? School, was made a controversial figure by the opposing groups on the question of Istithn?' i.e. to say &lt; Cx*y&amp;\ . This controversy arose in early discussions on the meaning of Im?n and Isl?m. According to the Hanafite version, Ibn Mas'?d might have once allowed the above phrase but later amended his opinion. To Ibn I-Ianbal, this was a distortion of the fact.</page><page sequence="9">ZIAUDDIN AHMAD 105 On the concept of Im?n and Islam, Ibn B?anbal, as this work strongly indicates, differed not only from the Hanafites but also from some fellow traditionists.28 To the Hanafites, Im?n and Islam signify two different meanings : Im?n is to believe and Isl?m is the confessed submission there to. They are, however, inseparable ; Isl?m could not be concieved of with out Im?n. In their view, Isl?m by mere profession could exist only legally. However, in their opinion, A'm?l (actions) have no share in Im?n. According to Bukh?r?, A'm?l are a part of both Im?n and Isl?m, hence the two are not different. al-Sh?fi'? also held this view29. For Ibn H?nbal, however, Isl?m is different from Im?n : the former means only Qawl and Iqr?r (profession of the faith), the latter signifies A'm?l (actions) including, of course, the A'm?l of the tongue.30 A considerably long portion of the section on Im?n and Isl?m of our work has been devoted to the refutation of the Murjite concept of Im?n, as well as to the establishment of Ibn Hanbal's own views. Accord ing to him, Murjites were those who held Im?n to be Iqr?r or Qawl and did not consider both Qawl and A 'm?l as parts of Im?n. To assert : Im?n is Qawl' was Bid'a ; no Salaf held this opinion. Ibn Hanbal, however, did not hold the Murjites to be K?firs. A juxtaposition of the varied versions made by Ibn Hanbal on the Murji'a would show that only the exclusion of A'm?l from the corpus of Im?n, not the denial of its increase and decrease, was the factor on the basis of which he decided whether a person was or was not a Murjite.3! It seems that the propagation of Ir ja9 was of more concern to Ibn Hanbal than the Bid'a itself. He advocated a social bycott against a MurjVi if he preached his Bid'a, or initiated a quarrel with those who dis agreed with him. Ibn Hanbal even recommended Khal* divorce for a woman from her Muji'i husband, if and when he invited the people to accept his views.32 In the chapters on the refutation of the Jahmiyya (Fols. 147a?153b, PP. 420?441), a general discucssion has been made on Jahm and the Jahmiyya. It includes discussions on Bishr al-Marls? and Aljmad b. Ab! Du'?d who initiated the infamoas Mifrna against the Imam alongwith a few contemporary persons of the same school. The chapter on the doctrines of the Jahmiyya (folios 154a?202a, PP. 442?516), mainly deals</page><page sequence="10">106 AN IMPORTANT HANBALI WORK with the createdness of the Qur'?n in great detail. It is curious to note that the name Mu'tazila is not mentioned any where in these pages, although the views discussed and refuted here were those held by them. It is not also clear why Ibn Hanbal always omits the word Mu'tazila, and employs the world Jahmiyya. It is , however, a fact that during the formative period of the Mu'tazalite movement, only the dogmas relating to Qadar and al-Wa'ld were discussed by thev Mu'tazilites. It was at a latter date that Abu'l-Hydhyl and al-Nazz?m of the Mu'tazilite school started dis cussions on the attributes of God already initiated by Jahm b. Safw?n over a hundred years ago. 3 3 Probably for this reason, the word Jahmiyya became a synonym for the Mu'tazilites who later denied the attributes of God. We know that Ibn rlanbal was a staunch upholder of the doctrine of the uncreatedness of the Qur'?n for which he had to face severe persecu tion by Mu'tasim at the instigation of Q?^? Arimad b. Ab? Du'?d, a Mu' tazilite bigot.34 But extensive informations available in our work reveal that in the beginning the Imam avoided as far as possible any attempt to take part in this controversy. To him, the Qur'?n was the Kal?m of God. It was not his concern whether it was created or uncreated. It is the extremism of his opponents which compelled him to advise his followers not to adopt a neutral role. One must categorically say that the Qur'?n is created. Once the Im?m is reported to have said, " Had the people (Jahmiyya and Mu'tazila) not been involved in this controversy, it would have been possible for me to maintain silence on this issue. Since they spoke about what they maintained, why should the other people not speak?" 3 5 We are told that after the death of Ibn Hanbal, a controversy as to the createdness and uncreatedness of the utterance of the Qur'?n was raging among his disciples. Both the contending groups made an endeav our to justify their view points with what they claimed to have received from their Im?m. 3 6 in order to clarify Ibn Hanbal's real position, al-Marr?dhl is reported to have compiled a booklet and read it before his disciples.3 7 It is certain that al-Khall?l based the last two chapters of the present work, which concerned ' Lafz al-Quran,' on the above mentioned booklet.</page><page sequence="11">AN IMPORTANT HANBALI WORK 107 In the present work two chapters have been devoted to the question of Lafz al-Qur'?n, in the first of which Ibn Hanbal refuted the Lafziyya, that is, those who held that one's utterance of the Qur'?n was created. And in the second and last chapter, he censured those who, in opposition to the Lafziyya, held that the ' Lafz ' was uncreated. We know that scholastic theology was an abonimation to Ibn Hanbal. He denounced ' Kal?m ' more than once and maintained in theology his devotion to Traditions and Precedents. He combatted all the sects-Kh?rijites, Murjites, R?ficlites, Qadarites, Jabrites** Jahmites and Mu'tazilites. He fought all independent thinking which sought to go beyond what the Salaf had believed. For him, theological truth could not be reached at by reasoning ' Aql Traditions (Naql) from the Salaf were the only ground on which words of the Qur'?n could be explained whose meaning was not self-evident. This was his position on legal matters as well.39 On all the above theological controversies, it appears that the present work is an encyclopaedic treasure of information on the positions taken by Im?m Ahmad b. Hanbal and the Salaf on which the creeds of Ahl al Sunna ultimately crystallized. NOTES 1. British Mus.
