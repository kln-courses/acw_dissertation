It from Darwin’s Finches and Other Birds may occur naturally, as with gravidity or large feeding events, The faces of vertebrates display a number of species-specific or artificially, such as with any weight lifting activity. Jumping and adaptive characteristics, which they acquired during with external loads has been studied in humans to determine evolution by natural selection. The classic textbook example of maximal performance, develop efficient training programs and adaptive radiation, natural selection and niche partitioning in define muscular properties. However, loading effects in animals animals is the fifteen closely related species of Darwin’s finches specialized for saltatory locomotion have not been thoroughly (Thraupidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity is in the studied. We examined the force-load relationship of Cuban tree size and shape of their beaks. This natural morphological frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) jumping to assess whether the diversity is associated with the exploitation of various mechanics of extrinsically loaded jumping are indicative of ecological resources and its developmental basis is not fully either a muscular or an elastic spring model. It was assumed understood. It is likely that this stunning diversity of beaks in that in jumps powered solely by muscle, the forces produced Darwin’s finches and cranial morphology in vertebrates more during a jump would increase with increased extrinsic load generally was produced by alterations in their craniofacial (F=ma). On the other hand, in jumps utilizing an elastic developmental genetics. We continue to discover high degree of mechanism, forces produced during jumping would not modularity in the developing finch beaks. For example, we increase with extrinsic load and would be a function of the recently discovered that two distinct regulatory and tissue constant elastic properties of the spring (F=kx=ma). Five modules regulate beak shapes. Such levels of modularity help individuals (body mass 15.1-32.2g) were jumped from a force to explain the levels of morphological variation observed in plate to quantify peak power, work, peak force, takeoff velocity Darwin’s finches. Moreover, we began analyzing beak shapes and jump duration. The frogs were loaded with removable using mathematical approaches followed by developmental custom made nylon backpacks placed near the center of mass studies in both Darwin’s finches as well as other groups of and filled with measured amounts of lead shot.

We found that animals. Finally, we are using a combination of morphometrics, these frogs maintain consistent work and peak force comparative and functional approaches to study evolution of performance across all loads. Therefore, we conclude that even the avian-specific cranial features during their evolution from under substantial loading conditions, Cuban tree frogs are more basal archosaurs and theropod dinosaurs.

A clear example of consequences. Moreover, recent budget cuts threaten physical developmental plasticity occurs in prefeeding sea urchin larvae, education programs in K-12 schools.

As we humans indicate that high childhood physical activity increases show here, increases in the size of this feeding structure the probability of adults being physically active (Telama et al improve food acquisition rates.

These results indicate that the developmental program standard cages (Swallow et al. 1998 Behav Genet), termed high combined with maternal provisioning predetermines the runner (HR) lines, and their non-selected control (C) lines to maximum feeding rate, independent of the environment. The investigate whether early exposure to a wheel affects activity food-dependent reduction in feeding structure size also levels as adults. Half of the mice were given wheel access decreases the expenditure of maternal lipids, providing a shortly after weaning for 21 consecutive days. Wheel access potential energy store to buffer future challenges or to invest in was then removed for 54 days, followed by 16 days of access for development towards the juvenile form. Thus, selective all mice. Early-life wheel access significantly increased pressures on maternal inputs and/or the developmental voluntary exercise on wheels during the first week of the program for increased feeding capacity must balance those second period of wheel access for all mice, with the effect operating on the food-induced dopamine-signaling mechanism tending to be greater in HR than in C. During this same time for conserving lipids that hasten development. The use of period, spontaneous physical activity inside the home cages dopamine in developmental plasticity in sea urchin larvae may was not affected by early-age wheel access, and did not differ have been co-opted from the use of food-induced dopamine between HR and C mice. These results support the hypothesis signaling in behavioral responses of diverse organisms from that early-age exercise can have beneficial effects on adult worms to humans. Preliminary results surveying Echinoidea levels of voluntary exercise, and have implications for public suggest that the putative co-option was an innovation of the policy.

Considering the different of pathogen co-evolution were experimentally infected in the evolutionary strategies giving rise to a prehensile tail (starting same captive environment.

To better understand experiments from the Lauder lab. mechanisms of limb bone loading in terrestrial locomotion, we correlated direct measurements of in vivo bone strain with muscle strain (via sonomicrometry) and EMG activation in a major hip extensor (Flexor tibialis internus) muscle of river cooter turtles (Pseudemys concinna) during treadmill walking. EMG recordings indicate activity prior to footfall that continues through approximately 60-70% of the stance phase. Large EMG bursts occur just after footfall when the muscle has reached its maximum length and is beginning to actively shorten, which it does through the first half of stance. At the time of peak bone strains (both principal and axial), the muscle fascicles are active but are no longer shortening, and remain isometric until late in stance when they passively lengthen occurs as the foot is preparing to be lifted from the tread. Peak bone loads therefore can be correlated directly with the action of limb muscles.

One solution is to break down extended periods of motion into a hierarchy of movement at different temporal scales. For example, the decomposition of movement into simpler building blocks has been used in robotic control applications and to describe kinematic and neural control features in both humans and animals. Recent work in flying insects suggests that specific combinations of rotation and translation form discrete units of movement that are then assembled to form more complex motion trajectories. We tested the generality of this model for flying animals by examining Anna’s hummingbirds (Calype anna) during periods of solitary and paired (competitive) flight in a large arena. The three dimensional positions and orientations were determined using a custom-designed automated tracking system capable of high temporal and spatial resolution. Unlike the previous description of insect flight modes, hummingbirds varied axial and torsional velocities continuously and no discrete units of movement were detected. However, the range of motions was constrained for both pure velocity components and for combinations of torsional and axial velocities. Comparing solitary to competitive flights across multiple days further revealed that the limits on movement vary by individual, behavioral manipulation and day of measurement. This suggests that a computational framework for describing free flight maneuvers can be used to study the limits to maneuvering performance.

LD-Alone birds sang more songs throughout the experiment and tended to sing earlier in the day than the other groups. LD-Alone birds also exhibited increases over time in the energy of their songs. By day 7, these birds were singing with more energy than the other groups. LD-Alone birds also increased the number of special syllables sung over time in a near-linear fashion, while the other groups did not. Another feature that distinguished LD-Alone birds is that they sang with higher entropy variance than the other two groups. Therefore, photoperiod and the social environment differentially regulate song output and structure in Border canaries: LD-Alone birds sang more songs and earlier than SD and LD-Paired birds and they sang louder and with less uniformity. We hypothesize that LD-Alone birds emphasize these changes in order to broadcast a complex signal to attract a potential mate. 51.4 AMIEL, Aldine; HENRY, Jonathan Q.; SEAVER, Elaine C.*; 89.4 ANDERSON, P*; RAYFIELD, EJ; RENAUD, S; Univ.

A geometric morphometric perspective when the immediate survival is threatened by stressful events. The turtle plastron (ventral shell) is covered by a series of This ELS redirects the individual away from the breeding stage keratinous scutes. Each scute is derived from one tissue so that it can cope with the perturbation and survive in the best condensation; therefore we might expect the scutes to be condition possible. At the proximate level, this ELS is promoted separate developmental modules. Similarly, the anterior and by an increased secretion of corticosterone and, during the last posterior plastral lobes of turtles with a hinged plastron may be two decades, most studies have been focusing on this stress separate modules because each lobe has to articulate with hormone.

One possibility is that waterborne cues some populations of P. occidentalis, regularly gather food while originating from a settlement surface may mix up into the water first brood develops (semi-claustral founding).

While substratum searching behaviors and queens of a naturally semi-claustral species in use of exogenous settlement selection in response to these cues have been food. I fed newly mated barbatus and occidentalis queens no described, experiments examining the effects of waterborne food, low food, or high food and measured the queen’s mass cues on larval swimming behaviors under natural flow lost during production of the first clutch, the size of the first conditions are rare. We are using digital video observations, clutch, and the size of the first worker. In both species, unfed larval tracking, and flow characterizations to examine how queens lost the most mass. In the claustral species, fed queens cyprids respond to waterborne cues in field-relevant turbulent lost more mass when they were fed less (low food) rather than conditions. Preliminary experiments in still-water containers more (high food). Fed semi-claustral queens, on the other hand, suggest that the average cyprid vertical swimming velocity lost equal mass regardless of the level of food provided. Food switched from upward to downward when a homogenously availability did not affect offspring size or clutch size in the dissolved waterborne cue was present. Subsequent experiments claustral species, but the semi-claustral species produced in a large racetrack flume examining changes in vertical larger offspring and clutches when exogenous food was swimming behaviors (e.g., velocity, tortuosity, sinking rate) as provided. Low and high food queens of both species produced larvae come into contact with filaments of cue in turbulent flow similar sized clutches and first workers. In conclusion, both will also be presented. claustral and semi-claustral queens can use exogenous food to maintain themselves during colony founding, but semi-claustral queens may be better than claustral queens at using exogenous food.

Conversely, the yellow stingray lacks cephalic specialization and its pores were more widely distributed across the body. Behavioral differences between the two species, rather than morphology, l ikely explain much of the discrepancy in electrosensitivity. Cownose rays are bentho-pelagic and spend much of their time in schools at the water surface, but prey primarily on benthic molluscs and may rely on cues other than electroreception until the last moments of prey localization. In contrast, the yellow stingray is exclusively benthic and feeds opportunistically on cryptic invertebrate prey, which demand greater sensitivity for detection. This study demonstrates that dramatic differences in sensory systems exist and that generalizations about sensory function may be inadequate, even within a closely related group.

However, the recent linearly with the time available for thermoregulation. description of a second species and new records from cold methane seeps suggests the need to re-evaluate Archinome from a taxonomic and evolutionary standpoint. This study examines the phylogenetic relationships of specimens identified as Archinome on a broad scale, including samples from the type localities of A. rosacea (Galapagos Rift) and A. storchi (Pacific Antarctic Ridge), as well as specimens from the Costa Rica Margin, Guaymas Basin, East Pacific Rise, Lau and North Fiji Basins, Mid Atlantic and Central Indian Ridges. Our results show that Archinome is monophyletic and includes at least six species, four of which are new to science. In the absence of clear morphological differences among species, the geographic distributions and diagnoses of species are re-delineated on the basis of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data and High-Resolution Melting Analysis. Distributional data of Archinome species indicate the potential for long-distance dispersal leading to broad distributions and the ability for larvae to cross a wide bathymetric depth range. Biogeographic connections between vents and seeps are highlighted, as are potential connectivity between populations from vent fields located in the northern Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

In contrast, populations of directly developing species may show more potential for local adaptation due to low levels of gene flow from outside the population. Local adaptation to current water temperature may make a species more vulnerable to warming global temperatures. I use species in the genus Crepidula to examine the role of larval type in local adaptation to water temperature using a common-garden experiment. C. convexa is a direct developer, while C. fornicata and C. plana have a planktonic larval stage. C. convexa is known to have high levels of genetic structure compared to C. fornicata. However, it is unknown if such neutral genetic structure corresponds to ecologically relevant differentiation in growth and survival at different temperatures. To test for local adaptation to temperature in Crepidula, I studied the effects of temperature on growth and survival of larvae from populations from the northern, middle, and southern parts of the ranges of C. fornicata, C. plana, and C. convexa. I collected adults from all three species from populations along the east coast of the United States and raised them in common laboratory conditions in a factorial temperature*origin design at 12oC, 20oC, or 28oC. There is no clear pattern of local adaptation in C. fornicata, but trends in survival in C. plana and C. convexa indicate potential local adaptation.

Hence, larval Phylogenetic clustering of commercially exploited fish swimming plays an important role in larval survival and species dispersal. Larval swimming is biomechanically constrained by Currently, over three-quarters of the world's fish stocks are the morphologies of larval bodies, which are often complex and depleted, overexploited, or fully exploited. Typical marine highly variable between developmental stages, and is strongly fishing practices tend to target the largest species in the food modulated by larval responses to environmental conditions. We web, which alters life history traits, such as age to maturity, combined a theoretical hydrodynamic model and experimental and increases risk of extinction.

Larval sand dollars systematically assessed.

This method calculates of food. Low tooth stress in juveniles and adults imposes the complexity of a 2-dimensional object and yields values mechanical constraints to puncturing and tearing, which are ranging from one (simple) to two (complex). At small sizes, circumvented by a preference for softer prey tissue or the trunk lateral lines in Xiphister are poorly developed resulting in inclusion of knotting behaviors for reducing tougher prey. low fractal dimensions (1.1-1.3). As Xiphister increase in size, branching of trunk lateral lines increases resulting in greater complexity and higher fractal dimensions (1.4-1.5). The implications of increasing fractal dimension of lateral line systems in Xiphister will be discussed, and comparisons to other fishes with multiple trunk lateral lines will be made. 33.1 CLEMENTE, CJ*; RICHARDS, CT; Harvard University; 104.2 CLIFFORD, MR*; RIFFELL, JA; University of clemente@rowland.harvard.edu Washington; cliffmar@uw.edu Limitations to swimming speed in drag based aquatic The role of pollinator olfactory processing in biasing systems floral scent evolution Within terrestrial systems, the fastest sprinters are neither the Chemical communication is an important and ancient method of largest, nor the smallest, but are intermediately sized.

Correlates in Six Terrestrial Lizard Species Mode of development in marine invertebrates has been largely Sprint performance is important to terrestrial lizards for viewed as a dichotomy between small eggs that develop into predator evasion, prey acquisition, and fitness. Because many free-living planktotrophic larvae and large eggs that bypass the terrestrial species encounter a variety of substrates during larval stage and develop directly into juveniles. Modes of locomotion, relationships between morphology, performance, development viewed as intermediate between these two and habitat use are ripe for research. Results from previous extremes include facultative feeding larvae, non-feeding studies suggest increased limb length and sprint speed is lecithotrophic larvae, and poecilogony where nutritional mode correlated with saxicoly. Results from studies on locomotion varies within a species. Available phylogenies, however, do not over compliant surfaces such as sand, however, are less clear usually show these forms in positions intermediate between despite psammophily likely imposing selective pressure. Sprint planktotrophs and direct developers, and recent optimality sensitivity, or the variation in sprint performance due to modeling efforts have also shown that “intermediate” differences in habitat or substrate use, has been useful in nutritional modes may be more evolutionary stable than studies of arboreal lizards. This study measured sprint previously believed. Are these forms truly transitional or sensitivity among six terrestrial lizard species that occupy intermediate, in evolutionary terms?

In experiment 2, sexually naive, ns females were paired with males that were non-stressed, stressed or severely stressed (exposed to additional handling). In these females, CORT was significantly higher only when the females were paired with severely stressed males. No relationship was observed here between CORT and neck grabs but CORT was significantly higher, on average, when the mate achieved a full copulatory sequence. In both experiments, female CORT was thus affected by the male stress status but in opposite directions. Comparison of the two data sets suggests that sexual experience may affect which male behaviors are perceived as stressful. While more controlled studies directly comparing and quantifying sexual experience will need to be conducted, these data highlight the complexity of the perception of male behaviors by females and a potential effect of previous experience. 52.1 DICKERSON, BH*; DANIEL, TL; RIFFELL, JA; University S1-1.7 DICKINSON, M.*; ZABALA, F.; POLIDORA, P.; ROBIE, of Washington; bdicker@uw.edu A.; BRANSON, K.; PERONA, P.; Univ. of Washingon, IORodeo, Shaken, not static: multimodal processing in the antenna Janelia Farm, HHMI, Caltech; flyman@uw.edu of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta.

Shortly after hatching the larger presumptive canal neuromasts or paedomorphic homologues are present. By 7 mm SL there are horizontal lines of SF present under the eye. At 9 mm SL the supraorbital canal above the eye has enclosed. Orthogonal lines of SF neuromasts have begun to form by 14 mm SL and by 30 mm SL the pattern of SF neuromasts reflects the adult pattern. In the mandibular region there is no enclosed canal, but there are two lines of SF neuromasts. One of those lines is in a groove, which is the first sign of canal development described in other fishes. More SF neuromasts may be advantageous because they are more sensitive to changes in velocity and they can detect lower frequencies. 35.5 DILLON, M.E.*; FRAZIER, M.R.; University of Wyoming, S6-1.7 DILLY, GF*; YOUNG, CR; LANE, WS; PANGALINAN, J; Laramie, U.S. EPA, Western Ecology Division, Newport, OR; GIRGUIS, PR; Harvard University, Mass.

That transfer function reveals a delay of approximately 50 ms and a high pass filter behavior with a 3 dB cut off at approximately 0.5 Hz. We also developed a physical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic-abdominal joint is used to redirect a constant lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering at time scales on the order of 5 ms. Our results agree with the behaviorally measured visual-abdominal transfer function of the moth, indicating that they may use a similar control strategy. Taken together, our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or “airframe” of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control.

Numerous ocean expeditions both before and after the legendary British Challenger led to a better appreciation of the complexity of marine ecosystems and the role of plankton while dispelling the notion of an “azoic zone“, “living fossils”, and the pantheistic concept that abiogenic processes fueled the evolution of metazoans from inorganic matter. This presentation will highlight some of the contributions of both the celebrated and lesser-known pioneers who helped establish the modern field of marine biology. 71.4 EERNISSE, D.J.*; KVIST, S.; BARRIO, A.; SIDDALL, M.E.; 42.8 EICHINGER, J.

(rapid ventilation). Both behaviors are marked by a large asymmetry between the inspiration and expiration phases, although the asymmetry is much more pronounced during cryptic ventilation. The relationship between the length of inspiration and expiration phases was also explored. Previously, authors have suggested that movements of the suspensorium and opercular series play little to no role in ventilation in Lophius. High-resolution video recordings, however, confirm that such skeletal movements are actively involved in the movement of water at the beginning of the suction phase and throughout most of  the pressure phase.  During rapid ventilation, movements of the suspensorium and opercular series make up a large portion of the ventilation cycle. When the jaws, opercular series, and suspensorium are not driving the movement of water during the inspiration phase, the hyoid slowly depresses and the branchiostegal rays slowly expand to increase the size of the buccal and opercular chambers. This slow expansion of the chambers frequently exceeds 60 seconds during cryptic ventilation in a pattern that maintains water flow across the gills.

However, eating other fish as asymmetries. Recently, we found that despite damaged wings, food typically requires overcoming what has been termed hawkmoths are able to maintain flight stability during hovering 'gape-limitation'. Because fish tend to be among the largest through neural modulation of muscle activity. Moths have to prey organisms eaten by other fish, a large gape, as well as constantly steer to counteract the torque produced by the wing mechanisms for manipulating the large prey for transport are asymmetry. Therefore, we expect to see a cost to this constant required. Many piscivorous lineages simply must grow into the steering on other aspects of flight performance such as piscivorous niche, waiting to attain a certain body size so that a maximum lift production.

Alternatively, costs by measuring (1) maximum load lifting capability and (2) several lineages independently have evolved jaw elongation oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during associated with piscivory. Jaw elongation allows for a larger hovering flight in hawkmoths (Manduca sexta).

Furthermore, when wing area is further reduced by clipping both wings symmetrically, vertical force production does not decrease below the levels measured for asymmetric clipping.

To further examine impacts on G. carolinensis we assessed the effects of Cu level on embryonic developmental rate from fertilization to free swimming.

For adults is strikingly inconsistent. For example, Aiken and Serranus tortugarum, a simultaneously hermaphroditic fish, Hailman (1978) found that adults were strongly photopositive, proportional male allocation (testis mass/total gonad mass) is whereas Bradley and Forward (1985) reported equally strong greater where local density and sperm competition are higher. negative phototaxis.

For photopositive in the Aiken design; likewise, photonegative controls, I included marked residents from each study site in adults were consistently so in both setups. Over 90% of our the experiment, and I also tested whether transplants across adults were negatively phototactic, as found by Bradley and similar densities would maintain similar sex allocation patterns.

Male allocation was increased through a reduction of Forward reared theirs from cysts (which requires regular relative ovary mass for Low to High density transplants and feeding). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that hungry adult was decreased through a reduction in relative testis mass for brine shrimp are more attracted to light than are well-fed High to Low density transplants. Respective increases in adults, and found this in fact to be the case: only 14% of relative testis mass or relative ovary mass with shifts in male individuals from a well-fed stock tank showed a positive allocation, which would indicate the trade-off assumed by photoresponse, but this proportion gradually rose to 60% by the theory, were not clearly shown. fourth day without food. These results provide a likely resolution for the contradictory results of previous studies: Aiken’s photopositive shrimp were hungry, whereas Bradley’s photonegative shrimp were not. This hunger-mediated phototaxis may be explained by the ecology of brine shrimp in the wild: light levels are highest at the surface of the water, where both phytoplankton (food for hungry brine shrimp) and birds (primary predators of brine shrimp) are in greater abundance. 107.3 HATTON, R.

Reconstructing these transformations requires these maneuvers, especially those beginning in a hovering or interpreting functional attributes of extinct forms by exploring slow forward flight state, are now regularly recorded in how similar features function in extant organisms. Yet attempts to understand the basis for these capabilities. extinct-extant comparisons are often difficult, because extant However, many factors contribute to the observed dynamics of adult forms frequently differ substantially from fossil material. the animal, complicating analysis of the recordings. These Here, we illustrate how postnatal developmental transitions in factors include sensory feedback which results in the animal living birds can provide rich, novel insight into the evolution of making changes to its wing kinematics and body configuration avian flight. As developing birds acquire flight capacity, to produce the maneuver or compensate for a perturbation, ontogenetic changes in feather and skeletal morphology tend to making the observed motions the result of a “closed-loop” parallel evolutionary changes in the theropod ancestors of feedback process. Additionally, passive effects such as drag and birds. Examining locomotor ontogeny may thus clarify potential the passive damping due to the interaction of basic (i.e. locomotor capacities of extinct theropods, by elucidating hovering) flapping kinematics with body motion also produce relationships between form, function, and behavior during forces which influence the dynamics of the animal. These obligately-bipedal to flight-capable transitions. To document “open-loop” or uncontrolled effects on the dynamics of the feather and skeletal ontogeny in the precocial chukar (Alectoris animal must be isolated and removed from the observations to chukar),  we (i) used a propeller apparatus to measure assess the animal’s active contribution to the observed aerodynamic forces generated by dried chukar wings over a movements.

Our results show that juveniles and adults with Manduca sexta to show how closed- and open-loop effects highly disparate anatomies employ remarkably similar skeletal combine in different ways. The first of these cases is an animal kinematics, possibly due to differences in aerodynamic force initiated pitch maneuvers and the second a response to pitch production. These findings are important for understanding perturbations. Despite the similarity of the maneuvers, the flight ontogeny and evolution.

Neurons in the MOB express costs. We tested this assertion by examining the effects of cannabinoid receptors, CB1R. The function of CB1R and their increases in perceived predation risk on the expression of endogenous activators, endocannabinoids, for neuronal inducible defences and their associated costs in larvae of the signaling in glomeruli is unknown.

We predicted increased action potential firing in PG cells, while CB1R the magnitude of inducible defensive responses of larvae would agonists inhibited PG cells.

Sex, weaponry and aggression in snapping Observations of walking in small children show that they move shrimp quite differently from what one would expect from downsized Sexual dimorphism in weaponry is often attributed to adults. Human adults are able to drive their legs actively with a intrasexual selection, wherein one sex maximizes reproductive frequency about 2-3 times of its passive swing frequency, success through competition. In snapping shrimp (Alpheus walking at 4/3rds of the speed achievable with passive swing spp.), sexual dimorphism in snapping claws – a deadly weapon – legs.

Finally, although sexual dimorphism is greater in A. angulosus, A. heterochaelis is more aggressive regardless of context. Female reproductive success is limited by body size; males, but not females, use claws as visual signals of size, suggesting that males may benefit from larger claws for functions other than their use as a weapon. Thus sexual dimorphisms in weaponry may result from differential advantages of investment in body vs. weapon size, rather than intrasexual selection for greater competitive ability in males. 22.8 HULSEY , C.D.; Univ. of Tennessee; chulsey@utk.edu 115.5 HUSAK, J.F.*; LOVERN, M.B.; Univ. of St. Thomas, Rates of Trophic Evolution in Lake Malawi Cichlid Fishes Oklahoma State Univ.; jerry.husak@stthomas.edu The cichlid fishes of Lake Malawi may represent the most Variation in circulating steroid hormones among rapidly diverging adaptive radiation of vertebrates on earth.

We also predicted that species of the same ecomorph category on different islands would have relatively similar testosterone levels.  That is,  trunk-ground anoles should have high testosterone levels compared to twig anoles on an island, with other ecomorphs being intermediate, and this pattern should be repeated across islands. We compared eight species within five ecomorphs from the Bahamas and Jamaica, finding significant differences among species in male and female testosterone levels. Even though the rank order of testosterone levels for the ecomorphs was not as we predicted, the order among ecomorphs was consistent across islands. When looking across species, we found no correlation between testosterone levels and corticosterone levels for males or females, but we did find a significant correlation between male and female testosterone levels across species.

Finally, the newborn and adult forms are similar to one another, but dramatic changes have taken place between the 20 mm stage and parturition. From my observations, I conclude that heart-tube looping occurs approximately one month into the 11-month gestation period and differs from heart-tube looping seen in anurans. The interatrial septum commences development shortly after heart-tube looping completes. No evidence of vestigial interventricular septum development is seen, but it is noteworthy that some vestigial development of the spiral valve (seen in anurans) appears to be a component during early development of the semilunar valves in the caecilian.

Finally, the use of Super Tutors (students maximum performance of diurnal geckos would not approach trained to tutor all 2-3 math/science courses being taken by a values of typical diurnal lizards.

Fishes can suppress invertebrate consumers that prey remarkably similar between slip perturbation trials and steady on bullfrog larvae, leading to higher bullfrog densities in fish state non-slip trials. Lower limb kinematics and COM dynamics containing ponds and thus considerable consumption of newts during slip perturbation and slip recovery will also be due to bullfrog tolerance of newt chemical defenses.

In order to characterize the columns (CCC) of the growth plate, and longitudinal growth histologic nature of this impressive hypertrophy, we compared rate (LGR) of the femur.

Contrary to our expectations, when running (stress, nutrition). Furthermore, intermediate levels of upside-down, cockroaches exhibit very similar COM kinematics developmental plasticity may enhance the ‘detection’ of cryptic compared to normal, upright runs. Nevertheless, our results do genetic variation in organisms the same way that intermediate highlight considerable differences in COM position and footfall levels of noise enhances signal detection in signal-detection patterns.

This study also shows that females are providing the same amount of albumen and yolk to all clutches but differing amounts of water. Due to the rainfall pattern, the decrease in water allocated to the eggs is compensated by the rise in rainfall during the incubation period.

Corticosterone, the a species transition from one mating system (e.g. dioecy) to primary stress hormone in birds, is of particular interest as a another (e.g. hermaphroditism).

We tested our hypotheses in two avian species -- zebra finches and laying hens. First, we administered a handling stress to zebra finches five hours prior to chromosome segregation and quantified sexes of the resulting embryos. Because laying hens often show dampened responses to handling, we instead elevated corticosterone in the physiological range using injections of corticosterone prior to chromosome segregation. Contrary to our hypothesis, neither zebra finches nor laying hens produced sex ratios that differed significantly from controls or hypothetical 50:50 ratios. Results of this study suggest that elevation of corticosterone concentrations within the physiological range for just a few hours prior to ovulation is not sufficient to bias sex ratios in birds.

In the past, continuous character (for example, limb length or body size). researchers have characterized shape diversity  with Standard practice in these analyses is to first generate a sample multivariate statistics and various simplified metrics of body of hypothesized historical rate regimes using a procedure called shape such as, elongation ratio (ER), fineness ratio (FR), and stochastic character mapping and then fit the model to each axial elongation index (AEI).

AEI describes the pipeline can sometimes lead to biased estimates of the morphology of the underlying axial skeleton but may have only evolutionary rates through time. a weak correlation with overall body shape. In this study, we present a new metric of body shape, the Vertebrate Shape Index (VSI), which describes shape using morphological features common to all vertebrate taxa: head length, the 2nd longest body axis (width or depth), vertebral number and the shape of individual vertebrate. We illustrate the usefulness of VSI on a data set of 140 species representing several major vertebrate groups (Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia). We also show how different animal preparations can be used to obtain the variables that comprise VSI by gathering data from radiographs, articulated skeletons, and cleared and stained specimens. Our study quantitatively describes body shape variation for a diverse sample of vertebrate taxa and highlights the relative importance of head length, second major axis (body depth/width), and vertebral characteristics as independent contributors to overall body shape diversity in vertebrates. 6.9 RICHARDS, Christopher T*; SAWICKI, Gregory; Harvard 109.5 RICHARDSON, C.S.*; CURLEY, B.; DAVIS, F.; University, North Carolina State University; Northeastern University; c.richardson@neu.edu richards@fas.harvard.edu The Effect of Circadian Disruption on Metabolic Rate and Power amplification in water: modeling muscle-tendon Immune Function in Vasoactive Intestinal Protein (VIP) dynamics during swimming Deficient Mice Models have demonstrated that the power required for some We investigated how the disruption of circadian rhythm affects animals to jump exceeds the theoretical limits of muscle power. basal metabolic rate (BMR) and immune function in lab mice Such work predicted that a muscle may store elastic energy in (Mus musculus).

Certain conditions produced power amplification where the m-t produced power ~18% greater than the limit for muscle alone. Surprisingly, k did not strongly influence m-t power output. For the heaviest limb, peak m-t power increased dramatically with ema, but was not influenced strongly by increases in fin area. For the lowest limb mass, m-t power output was highly sensitive to both ema and area, with maximum m-t power produced with fin area = 0.05 or 0.5 or 5 cm2, for ema = 0.025 , 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. These interactions suggest multiple ‘optimal’ morphological configurations for tuning m-t power which depend on interactions among limb mass, fin area and ema.

In Drosophila adult females JH regulates the timing of the onset of mating receptivity as well as egg maturation. Genetic allatectomy during adult development caused a delay in the onset of receptivity that was prevented by application of JH at eclosion. The loss of Met causes a similar delay. Expression of Met RNAi in brain neurons known to be involved in female receptivity delayed the onset of receptivity, suggesting that JH acts via Met to promote the maturation of these neurons. Thus, in the regulation of both metamorphosis and reproduction, JH acts primarily via Met.

Surprisingly, we found no change in HR during steady flights across a wide range of flight speeds (0-16 m/s), indicating that cockatiels do not adjust HR to alter oxygen supply to their flight muscles. Instead, HR remained constant across the entire range of flight speeds at 817 ± 5 beats/min (mean ± SD across all flight speeds), elevated about 2.3-fold relative to the resting value (356 ± 2 beats/min). We therefore suggest caution when using heart rate as a proxy for estimates of metabolic power during avian flight.

A general finding is that network interactions produce strikingly reliable, robust developmental mechanisms. Next, we identify specific network connections that arose in the euechinoid lineage. Crucially, these appear to have been layered on top of the pre-existing network while leaving ancestral functions intact, thus illustrating the evolutionary principle of accretion as opposed to wholescale replacement. We examine how the result is a complex, multi-layered network, with superficially redundant elements and a highly robust structure.

Female predicting how individuals will respond to changing and novel birds modulate egg size according to several factors, such as environments. Diet has been hypothesized to play a role in diet and reproductive experience, but the capacity for constraining the evolution of large, costly brains. This work modulating egg size in real time — as the eggs are being provides the first systematic test of this idea.

These results show the evolution of neural investment, at least in the short term. that females can use cues from the first-laid egg to modulate in real time the size of subsequent eggs, even egg two, which is already in the oviduct at the time the first is laid. In an effort to understand the adaptive significance of this capacity, I also discovered that, in unmanipulated nests, hatching delay increased as the egg deviated in volume from the clutch mean. Therefore, minimizing within-clutch variation in egg size through real-time modulation may benefit the female by reducing hatching delays. 115.3 SOMJEE, Ummat*; ABLARD, Kelly; CRESPI, Bernard; S4-2.3 SOTKA, E.E.; College of Charleston; sotkae@cofc.edu SCHAEFER, Paul/W; GRIES, Gerhard; Simon Fraser University, Selection, dispersal and the geography of phenotype in Vancouver, Canada, US department of Agriculture, Newark, the sea DE; ummat.s@gmail.com Population-level differences in phenotypic traits (a.k.a., the Sex ratio adjustment in a solitary parasitoid wasp geography of phenotype) have been the research focus of Sex ratio theory has yielded some of the clearest examples of evolutionary ecologists since and including the studies of adaptive evolution in animal behavior.

We tested the hypothesis that case studies. O. kuvanae exhibits LMC by investigating the effect of number, size and relatedness of wasp foundresses on egg masses with identical number of eggs. As predicted by the LMC theory, with increasing numbers of wasp foundresses on an egg mass, the proportions of emerging sons increased. In contrast, the presence of a sibling or a non-sibling female during oviposition, or the size of a female, did not affect the number or sex ratio of offspring produced. With no Local Resource Competition (LRC) among O. kuvanae larvae, the sex ratio of emergent son and daughter wasps is due entirely to the sex allocation by ovipositing wasp foundresses on host egg masses. This is the first study to have experimentally decoupled the effect of LRC from that of LMC.

Grasshoppers reared in the hot environment were paler and blood PO and proPO titers were significantly less than those reared in the cool one. Consistent with PO and proPO activities, those reared in the hot environment had greater mortality from fungal infection and shorter median survival time. We have shown experimentally that melanism in response to ambient temperature is also associated with changes in immunity. Although the change in coloration is generally considered adaptive for thermoregulation, its association with enzymatic immunity makes it detrimental from the standpoint of combating invasion.

The ruling paradigm has been of common, highly-variable, broadly-distributed species. Intensive sampling programs targeting under-explored offshore hard bottoms in coral reef environments, coupled with new morphological and molecular data (partial COI, 12S, 16S sequences), are challenging this paradigm, revealing species complexes of small, rare and geographically circumscribed species complexes, species pairs differing in mode of larval development, and unsuspected relationships among recognized genera. Monophyly of the family as currently circumscribed is not supported. Actual diversity of the family is likely two to three times higher than currently recognized, requiring the description of many new species, and rescue of some of the roughly 1000 available names that have been sunk in synonymy or have fallen from use.

We measured voluntary bite force, speed, and pressure of wild-caught loggerhead shrikes using force and pressure transducers coupled with high-speed digital videography, and extracted digital images of their bills for further geometric morphometric analysis. We tested for relationships among aspects of bill morphology (e.g., shape) and bite performance (e.g., force) to examine potential trade-offs in bill form and function. Certain characteristics, such as a longer bill hook, that may be favorable for seizing and processing vertebrate prey, may be disadvantageous for the production of powerful bite forces important for subduing and dispatching them (e.g., due to greater risk of fracture).  Thus, predictions for morphology and performance may lead in opposite directions, resulting in complex interactions between them.

The lack of variation between genotypes when scaled for mass is surprising given that previous research found differences in walking among all genotypes. Lever experiments with mdm mutant and wildtype muscles have shown that mutant muscles are stiffer than wildtype muscles when passive but more compliant when active. Perhaps the increased passive stiffness is in some way compensating for the increased active compliance in jumping but not in walking.

At the same biodiversity. In several examples of Müllerian mimicry, where time, they activate blocks of muscle successively, resulting in a two or more toxic species resemble each other, a single species wave of neural activity that moves down the body. The two is known to resemble more than one model species. This waves do not usually move at the same speed, though, meaning situation would seem to provide a good scenario for speciation: that muscle activity and bending are relatively in phase as populations diverge to resemble different models, both rostrally, but grow increasingly out of phase caudally. The pre-mating and post-mating isolation could evolve. Ranitomeya result of this neuromechanical phase lag is that when caudal imitator is a species of poison frog from central Peru which is muscle is active, it is overpowered by external fluid forces so involved in Müllerian mimicry with 4 other species of poison that the muscle is lengthened and absorbs energy. Although frogs. There are four primary mimetic morphs of R. imitator, this effect appears at first glance to be inefficient, it may each of which occurs in different geographical regions.

Models with a relatively large of preference was enhanced where these morphs were neuromechanical phase lag had a lower cost of transport at a sympatric. Current research is focused on testing mating steady speed, supporting the idea that the phase lag facilitates preferences on additional color morphs, and using alternative effective force transmission during steady swimming. However, methods for measuring mating preferences. our results were strongly dependent on the frequency of the swimming pattern, while fishes have been observed to maintain the phase lag over a wide range of frequencies. Therefore, we conjecture that neural feedback may be required to maintain a phase lag over the range of swimming frequencies. 120.6 UEDA, N.*; DEGNAN, S.M.; The University of 73.4 UHRIG, E.J.*; LEMASTER, M.P.; MASON, R.T.; Oregon Queensland; nobuo.ueda@uqconnect.edu.au State University, Corvallis, Western Oregon University, Nitric oxide as a regulator of marine invertebrate Monmouth; uhrige@science.oregonstate.edu metamorphosis: behavioural and molecular insights Chemical Ecology of the Red-spotted Garter Snake, The nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathway plays multiple roles in Thamnophis sirtalis concinnus biological systems, one of which appears to be regulation of the To date, most studies of garter snake chemical ecology have initiation of larval settlement and metamorphosis in diverse focused on the female sexual attractiveness pheromone of the marine invertebrates.

By weight, they increase flap frequency (from 7 to 9Hz) but reduce using a real-time 3D tracking system in conjunction with high flap amplitude (from 1cm down to 0.5cm).

THE SUCCESS of peregrines as predators of pigeons may thus be attributed to aerodynamic cunning during ascent, and gravity-powered acceleration during descent.

We carried out this test by measuring energy gills, under normal functioning conditions.

We employed two experimental methods: we used cavities of living individuals of the keyhole limpet Diodora open flow respirometry to measure oxygen consumption of aspera.

We made these assessments from aerodynamic measurements using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (SDPIV).

The sodium bicarbonate experiments demonstrate that most animals show strong velocity dependence in metabolic expenditure for flight. However, some individuals did not conform to this pattern, and employ different energetic strategies with changing flight speeds. Mechanical efficiency measured for Leptonycteris yerbabuenae follows a U-shaped curve, with values between 18 and 23%. 13.5 VON DASSOW, M*; DAVIDSON, LA; Univ. of Pittsburgh; 5.1 VON DASSOW, Y.J.; Duke University, NC; mvondass@gmail.com yasmin.vondassow@duke.edu Does temperature dependence of morphogenesis require Benthic baby snatchers: predation on marine invertebrate fine control of tissue mechanics? embryos inside gelatinous egg masses Understanding morphogenesis requires deciphering how A common reproductive strategy for marine invertebrates organ isms  wi ths tand  env i ronmenta l  per turbat ions . involves the packaging of embryos into benthically-deposited Environmental temperature strongly affects developmental egg structures.

A simple model based on these masses fail to provide protection for embryos, and are in fact conditions suggests tight constraints on how tissue mechanics specifically targeted by predators. In one case, embryos of s h o u l d  c h a n g e  w i t h  t e m p e r a t u r e  t o  a l l o w  n o r m a l maldanid polychaetes are eaten directly out of the gel by the morphogenesis.

When investigated at a fine scale, temperature caused heterochronic shifts in morphogenesis. As temperature rose, the speed of blastopore closure increased more slowly than the speed of dorsal-to-ventral progression of involution. While there was only a ~25% shift from 16 to 26°C, this invalidates an assumption of our model.

To investigate how this evolutionary transition prove to be an important tool in understanding the population affected the fluid dynamics of antennule flicking, I examined dynamics of amphibians. the kinematics of antennule flicking by filming hermit crabs (Coenobita rugosus) and the antennule morphometrics by collecting their antennules for scanning electron microscopy. Using these data, a dynamically scaled physical model of the antennule was constructed, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure fluid flow around the model. PIV results indicate that although terrestrial hermit crabs have homologous antennule movements and morphological features with marine crabs, they do not discretely sample odors. Flicking by terrestrial hermit crabs could serve to increase the probability of encountering odors in turbulent air flow.

I examined the effect of temperature on the size of this putative sexual signal (phallus size) by chronically exposing males to either 20° or 30°C for four weeks. I also tested the influence of these thermal environments on various measures of male quality; including male territorial performance, swim speed and gamete function. Males chronically exposed to 30°C possessed longer phalluses greater ejaculate sizes, larger testes and faster sperm swimming speeds than those exposed to 20°C. This is the first study to show that environmental variation in phallus size can be a reliable indicator of male physical performance and gamete quality.

We developed and validated 84 novel recordings of naidid annelids over many days, allowing us to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers for this species capture the complete regeneration process. Using this that we use to distinguish populations on the U.S. East and technique, we have obtained the first direct evidence of cell West Coast.

Females born before the summer solstice (long days, LD) reach maturity quickly and often breed that same year. In contrast, females born after the summer solstice (short days, SD) may delay reproductive development to the following spring when conditions are favorable. In Siberian hamsters, development in SD is associated with significant structural and functional differences in the ovary as compared to females held in LD. These SD-induced differences include a greater number of primordial follicles and an abundance of hypertrophied granulosa cells (HGCs), which are immunoreactive for anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Ovarian developmental differences in SD are thought to result from suppression of gonadotropins, but this hypothesis has not been adequately tested. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether gonadotropin suppression explains the SD ovarian phenotype. Specifically, we treated LD females with the GnRH antagonist acyline every other day, beginning at weaning (postnatal day 18) and continuing until 10 wk of age. Control LD and SD females were similarly treated with vehicle. We found that acyline induced SD-like decreases in ovarian and uterine horn mass and serum FSH and AMH. Conversely, primordial follicle numbers and ovarian Amh mRNA levels were not significantly different than in controls, and HGCs were not observed. Our data suggest that gonadotropin suppression alone does not completely account for the SD ovarian phenotype and other factors may be involved, including SD-induced changes in other hormones, such as melatonin and prolactin. This possibility will be the subject of future studies. January 3-7, 2012, Charleston, SC </page> </plain_text>
