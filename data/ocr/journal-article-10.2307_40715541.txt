<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMONG RECENT ACQUISITIONS A Seated Vajrasattva, Adi-buddha The tangled skein of creeds and cults, gods and demons, myth and magic that makes up the Buddhism of the high Himalayas is a formidable study for the Western mind. The art of this region can appear no less recondite when appraised solely in its theistic context. The confused tangle of religious beliefs is further complicated by the multitude of foreign styles and conventions that have constantly flowed into the area to be assimilated in varying degrees with varying permanence. It is well to remember, though, that no matter how arcane the influence, how passionate or mystical the motivation of the artist, it is still a corporal hand that fashions the clay or guides the brush. We may make a sensible ap- proach to the understanding of the more esoteric arts simply by looking at them in terms of our own idealism and expecting from the artist no more or less than his humanness is capable of rendering. A subsequent deeper knowledge of the influence and motivations that produce the art becomes, then, an enrichment of the original, satisfying experience. The small Nepalese figure which now belongs to the Museum does not present the difficulties that the more arcane images with multiple limbs and terrifying aspect often pose, yet, at first, the unnaturally long legs, the almost feminine face and the heavy halo disturb the Western observer. However, when we look again at the object as an object, we find great appeal in the poise and balance of the canted arms and torso resting se- curely on the solid triangle of the lower body and firmly seated base. This posture provides all of the support necessary to sustain in perfect balance the large ovoid of the head with its crown of rising triangular elements and the surrounding upward-thrusting nimbated form. The lovely softness of the surface, neither slick nor shiny, aids in blending the separate volumes, further consolidating and giving continuity to the total concept. In form and line and surface texture the object is com- posed, poised and satisfying. 1</page><page sequence="2">AMONG RECENT ACQUISITIONS As a religious icon, the Vajrasattva holds an important place in the Nepalese Buddhist pantheon. He is one aspect of the Adi-buddha, literally the first Buddha, the primordial wisdom, the essence of Buddhahood. For some sects he is the sixth and controlling Dhyani Buddha. The most important symbols of his power are the vajra and the vajra bell or ghanta. In vaj rayana Buddhism the vajra is called the thunderbolt and re- ferred to as the diamond for the qualities of purity, indestructability and hardness it represents; the vajra bell is symbolic of the female principle of the phenom- enal world as opposed to the numinous "diamond world" of the phallic vajra. The right hand holds the vajra to the chest; the left holds the ghanta and rests on the thigh at the waist. The hands that hold these all-powerful symbols show great strength yet hold them lightly and literally in balance. It becomes obvious that the one who holds such powerful symbols so effort- lessly must, in essence, be of their power. Every aspect of the icon seems to confirm and reconfirm the presence of the absolute and supreme wisdom and the capacity of ultimate triumph. Whereas the lithe body is in the most dynamic ten- sion, there is no stress. Whereas the figure is seated, it cannot be said to hold a posture; the tensioned legs counterbalance and support the swaying torso, and the upward thrust of the nimbus and rotational motion of the arms seem to lighten the whole imperceptibly. All is tuned, lightly but tightly strung and vibrant - a celestial moment stopped. At this caught moment, the gaze of the eyes is down, the sensuous lips are smiling out. It is not a compassionate look but a knowing one - the knowing beyond compassion. The object is successful as sculpture more for the articulation of form than for form itself; more for the sustaining of movement than for its vigor. Despite the sensuous treatment of the body, the work seems more in tune with constructivist than figurai sculpture. But it is as an icon that it is most successful, for the artist who crafted it succeeded in fulfilling not only the aesthetic and iconographical requirements but, apparently, the mystical ones as well. Solidly cast of copper with gold and other metals, the figure retains some of its gilding and red and blue paint on the headdress and crown, respectively. As is the usual practice, the body is clothed and arrayed in the manner of a Dyhani bodhisattva. The hair is caught up in a high chignon with spiral curls falling down to each shoulder. The three-part jeweled crown is fastened with a flat diadem. Jeweled earplugs pierce the ears, while snakelike, jeweled bracelets encircle each upper arm. A bangle is worn at each wrist. The simple upper garment is tucked into the loincloth at the back and right side, crosses the back and breast and is caught at the left shoulder by a clasp; the trailing end drapes down below the waist in the rear. The loin- cloth is secured at the waist with a belt with a jeweled clasp; the garment falls to mid-calf and the end of the central gathering emerges from beneath the legs, in front of the figure on the lotus platform. The long, sacred thread crosses from the left shoulder beneath the upper garment and falls into the lap and across the thigh, traversing the right thigh to cross the buttocks and run up the back to disappear in the folds of the garment. The lotus seat is flat and decorated with perimeter scalloping and small circles. The top edge of the plat- form is beaded with comparable striations on the verti- cal face. The longer, exterior petals of the loti-form base are incised with lines emerging from the center. All of the petals are outlined with incised lines at their out- side edges. The flaming nimbus is undecorated except 2</page><page sequence="3">rear view, Seated Vajrasattva, Adi-buddha, ca. 7th-8th centuries Nepal copper alloy with gilt and polychrome, height 63/s inches Museum purchase, W.

The nimbus has been forced forward from its original vertical position, ap- parently through accident. The dating of this image presents problems that are not quickly or easily solved; therefore, the early date given is presented tentatively. The piece seems to present itself as a Nepalese permutation of the late Gupta style to which it is related in iconography. More importantly, the handling of the volumes of the body seems to relate strongly to stone images in Nepal that have been given 7th- and 8th-century dating. The piece has marked sim- ilarities in content and rendering to the Vajrapani in the Stanford University Museum which has also been given a 7th-century attribution. A Bodhisattva from Gandhara Through a recent gift, The May Department Stores Company has presented the Museum with five sculp- tures of Buddhist and Jain religious origin from South and Southeast Asia. Of the five, the important Mon- Dvaravati standing Buddha is illustrated elsewhere in this Bulletin in connection with the current exhibition of South and Southeast Asian art from the Museum's collections, and the Bodhisattva figure of impressive size from Gandhara is illustrated here. The Buddhist art of Gandhara is generally better-known and appreciated in the West than any other style or aspect of classical Indian art. Finds and excavations by the British in India in the 19th century aroused interest and stimulated the first research into the art of Gand- hara. Naturally, the stylistic ties with the classical art of the West aroused much speculation about the origins of the Gandharan style. As research and study continue, we are becoming much more aware of the influences of the art of Gandhara on the Buddhist art of Asia and, particularly, of the relationships and influences of the classical civilizations on Gandharan development in the first centuries of the Christian era. The sculpture of Gandhara was first termed "Greco-Buddhist," and par- ticular emphasis was placed on the direct influence - if not the hand - of the Bactrian-Greek survivors of the Alexandrian cities. Although this influence is to be counted in terms of the residual manifestation of the earlier, classical style that entered the cultural main- stream, the actual sources of the Gandharan style are a more complicated problem. Gandhara's location was of paramount importance in the development and diffusion of its style. Its position in what is now a part of western Pakistan was truly that of a great crossroads, not only of trade but also of the great VÃ¶lkerwanderung out of high Asia. It was but one phase of that migration that brought a group of nomadic peoples of Scythian stock called the Yueh chi into the area, driving out their forerunners who had, in their turn, conquered the Bactrian Greeks. Like so many other peoples before them, the Yueh chi became settled, adapting to the civilized life of the peoples and cities they conquered. Early in the first century there arose a strong dynasty known as the Kushan that consolidated and expanded its holdings in the area. In the late first or early second century the Kushan crown descended to Kanishka, an able and bril- liant king who not only tolerated Buddhism as had his predecessors but espoused and vigorously patronized it. His enlargement of the Kushan empire expanded the influence of Buddhism and Buddhist art. Great stupas and monasteries were erected at the Gandharan sites and at the eastern center of Natura. The remarkable coincidence of strong and settled empires throughout the ancient world in the first and 4</page><page sequence="5">Standing Bodhisattva, 2nd century Western Pakistan, Gandhara grey schist, height 52% inches Gift of The May Department Stores Company 41:68</page><page sequence="6">AMONG RECENT ACQUISITIONS second centuries resulted in relative peace and a flour- ishing trade between the shores of the Mediterranean and the great cities of Han Dynasty China. This trade vastly enriched Kanishka's realm and, with it, Bud- dhism and its art. Enrichment took not only the form of gold and goods. The influx of ideas and artisans, the very variety of style of the sumptuous and utilitarian objects that found their way to Gandhara was the true and lasting enrichment. The styles of the Roman world - Parthian, Scythian, Chinese and, most crucially, In- dian - made their mark on the art of Gandhara. It was probably early in Kanishka's reign that the first anthropomorphic image of the Buddha was produced. Heretofore, the Historical Buddha, as Sakyamuni or Siddhartha, was represented symbolically by graphic representations of his doctrine of the depictions of ob- jects that recalled important events in his earthly life. Along with the Buddha image there were representa- tions of the Bodhisattvas - those who have renounced nirvana in order to apply themselves to the saving of mankind - and representations of Sakyamuni while still a prince and before his renunciation of the world. In a lesser category were the numerous representations of persons and beings important to the life of the Buddha and of the doctrine and the monastic ideal, all occupy- ing varying positions of importance in the growing pantheon. The Museum's newly acquired Bodhisattva is of a type often found in Gandharan art of the second century: a standing figure with one leg slightly ahead of the other and with the right hand (now missing) in the gesture of reassurance or abhayamudra. The figure is dressed in the style of an Indian prince. The lower half is draped with a dhoti that falls in horizontal folds around the legs and is gathered in long, tight pleats that fall be- tween the legs in front. A long scarf or dupatta covers the left shoulder, falls across the front of the dhoti and is caught up over the right forearm. The head is dressed with jeweled diadems that meet at the front at a now- missing cockade or other decorative headpiece. Heavy necklaces and amulet bands of precious metals, jewels and pearls encircle the neck and upper body. The left hand is braceleted and holds what appears to be a mesh purse. The sandals are richly decorated in a man- ner similar to the necklaces. A large and undecorated nimbus frames the head and shoulders. The dress and adornment of the figure are essentially Indian, yet we can readily see the influence of the West in the handling of the drapery which recalls the art of Republican Rome. So too, the model for the face was neither Indian nor Scythian but one of many examples of the Roman Apollo. This head, with its youthful, al- most sweet countenance, has no precedent in Indian art but is of a type that was to provide the basis for the refined and vital Gupta style. The nude torso is very long, and its volumes are flat- tened in an almost abstract manner. This flattening of planes is also seen in the dupatta where it crosses the left shoulder and where it is draped over the right arm. In contrast, the treatment of the clothing is strongly three-dimensional and sharply cut. The figure, carved of bluish-grey schist in more than half round, is unfinished at the rear, having been de- signed for placement in an architectural alcove or niche. The surfaces are not polished but smooth. It is difficult to imagine the impression that figures such as this must have made in their original settings. Origi- nally poly chromed and gilded, these objects were part of an architectural scheme which included a multitude of other images. The Gandharan Buddha is now on view in the special exhibition galleries. The Mon-Dvaravati Buddha and the three other objects acquired through this generous gift will be discussed in future numbers of the Bulletin. 6</page><page sequence="7">CITY ART MUSEUM OF SAINT LOUIS BULLETIN</page></plain_text>
