<plain_text><page sequence="1">Salma Monani Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films: The Potentials and Limitations of Being Caribou In spring 2003, Karsten Heuer and Leanne Allison, white Canadian newlyweds, stood on the frozen Porcupine River in Yukon, Canada. They had just waved goodbye to Randall Tetlichi, their host from the Gwich'in Indian village of Old Crow. Equipped with skis and heavy backpacks, they were about to embark on their honeymoon. They would follow the Porcupine caribou herd from interior Yukon to the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and back- a 1500-mile, five-month trek. It would be their "grand adventure" (Heuer 22), and they would document it not only through writings but also as a film. The following year the couple, with the help of the Canadian National Film Board, released the resulting documentary as Being Caribou. The film proved successful, screening at a number of Canadian and US film festivals such as the Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival (where it won the Most Popular Canadian Film for 2004), EarthVision (Honorable Mention, 2004), the MountainFilm in Telluride, Colorado (Best Environmental Film, 2005), and Wild and Scenic Film Festival (People's Choice Award, 2005). It aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's The Nature of Things in June 2005. The filmmakers also actively worked with US environmental groups, specifically the Alaska Wilderness League, an activist Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 19.1 (Winter 2012) Advance Access publication April 5, 2012 doi:10.1093/isle/iss023 © The Author(s) 2012.

As is the habit of many environ- mental groups, the League immediately recognized the potential power of visual representations in forwarding their agenda, and ordered 2500 copies of the film, which they repeatedly screened at campaigns across the nation.1 The film was hand-delivered to all US senators in January 2005 as Congress debated opening the Refuge to drilling via a budget reconciliation bill (Heuer and Allison). The film is accessible on Amazon.com (for $12.99) and on the original and updated versions of the couple's website ( Being Caribou : Five Months on Foot with the Endangered Porcupine Caribou Herd and Necessary Journeys , respectively). Necessary Journeys claims that to date, the film has screened at over 10,000 locations in the United States, and the site provides information on how to organize a screening and purchase a copy of the film for $20. Because Being Caribou is a film that combines encounters with wild animals and wilderness adventure with an explicit political agenda, and because this political agenda also pays homage to the Native Americans embroiled in the battle of the Refuge debate, the film provides insight into the potentials and problems of contempo- rary wilderness discourse within the adventure-nature film categori- zation. To elaborate upon this claim, I first define what I mean by adventure-nature film. I then turn to ways in which Being Caribou upholds and challenges the genre's tropes of wild nature as a space for sublime adventure, for animal encounters, and for Native American worldviews to discuss how generic restrictions of film mediate contemporary wilderness discourse. Adventure-Nature Films: Playing in the Wilderness The term adventure-nature refers to films that demonstrate a par- ticular understanding of adventure and nature. In them, nature is a wild space and habitually outside the boundaries of the viewer's life; the adventure lies primarily in the thrill of crossing the boundary and facing the power and unpredictability of the wilderness. Works in this genre include shows on the Discovery Channel (Lee Stroud's Survivor Man , Bear Gryll's Man vs. Wild , Steve Irwin's Crocodile Hunter) or ESPN Outdoors (Spook Span's Monster Buck Moments , Cyril Chaquet's Fishing Adventurer, Tom Miranda's Territories Wild); films on extreme sports such as Mark Obenhaus's Steep , Dean Potter's Aerialist, or the adaptation of Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, or films such as Sean Perm's Into the Wild (another Krakauer adaptation), and Peter Lynch's</page><page sequence="3">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 103 Grizzly Project. By depicting adventure in the wilderness, generic adventure-nature films mimic and reiterate the characteristics of adventure-recreation, what Alan Ewert describes as "a self-initiated recreational activity that usually involves a close interaction with the natural environment, structurally contains elements of perceived or real risk and danger, and has an uncertain outcome that can be influ- enced by the participant and/or circumstance" (328). Central to their narrative is the thrill and celebration of competing to survive within a wild space. As historian Richard White (and subsequently various other scholars including Ewert) have pointed out, the self-initiated recrea- tional activity that highlights the thrill of adventure in the wilderness is usually the privilege of a people with the spare money and time to compete in nature as a choice , not a necessity. To heighten the thrill, adventure-recreation often involves a sense of danger. As White writes, "We try to make play matter as if it were work, as if our lives depended on it" (174). White, along with others such as William Cronon and Carolyn Merchant, have pointed out that costuming play as work is a tradition firmly rooted in the Euro- American ideal of nature as a sublime wilderness and frontier space. Romanticized as the site of an ancestral simple life, such nature presents a sense of sal- vation from the hurly-burly of modernity, a connection with a mythic cultural heritage, and a primeval self. By tapping into this cultural fascination with "playing" in nature, the adventure-nature film lures audiences into their own form of adventure-recreation, which is physically sedentary yet symbolically active. Even as television shows such as Crocodile Hunter and Man vs. Wild draw audiences into the thrill of playing in nature, there are others such as Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man and Aguirre : The Wrath of God that complicate the adventure-nature narrative as they provide critiques of individuals who are driven to seek the thrill of adventure in the wilderness. As such films consciously reflect on what it means to adventure in nature, there is also a growing scholarly literature that examines adventure-nature films, even though it doesn't quite identify the genre as its own category. For example, scholars such as Gregg Mitman, Derek Bouse, and Cynthia Chris have analyzed such films within the category of wildlife films. In Reel Nature , Mitman examines historic films such as Roosevelt in Africa , which documented Theodore Roosevelt's 1909-10 African safaris; the early film entrepre- neur Colonel Selig's Hunting Big Game in Africa , Alone in the Jungle , and In Tune with the Wild; and Osa and Martin Johnson's expedition films Trailing African Wild Animals , Simba , and Congorella. Each of these films highlights the thrill of adventuring in wilderness.</page><page sequence="4">104 ISLE This reference to Mitman's Reel Nature suggests how the tag of wildlife films is useful in articulating how adventure-nature films can be productively analyzed within interdisciplinary scholarship that draws from and adds to wilderness studies, animal studies, and film studies. Along with Mitman's Reel Nature, Cynthia Chris's introduc- tion to Watching Wildlife (2006) also outlines the existing research at this intersection as she highlights the work of scholars such as Donna Haraway, Gregg Mitman, John Berger, Derek Bousè, and Akira Mizuta Lippit. Since the publication of Watching Wildlife additional concerted research in animal studies and film studies continues to make room for productive intersections (see, for example, sections of Sean Cubitt's EcoMedia, Daston and Mitman's Thinking with Animals : New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism and also articles such as those by Horak and Vivanco). Such interdisciplinary research reminds us that though films present their own unique discursive and material realm- in film lan- guage, production, distribution, and reception- they are nonetheless part of a long tradition of cultural representations that project all too human desires and fears onto nature. Writing specifically about wild- life films, Cynthia Chris states, "we look not only at animals to learn about them, but we also look through animals at ourselves" (x). In the context of adventure-nature films, we might add that we look with fascination at the "adventurers" and their particular relation- ships with nature to learn about ourselves. In effect, although wildlife films and adventure-nature films overlap, the latter films do deserve their own categorization because their central focus is not necessarily on the animals but instead is on their human protagonists. It is this focus that is used to capture audi- ences. For example, in Luis Vivanco's analysis, Irwin's Crocodile Hunter rides upon the man more than the crocodiles of the Australian Outback as viewers are drawn in by "the quirky Australian's ability to find, capture, manipulate, and explain danger- ous reptiles and animals in exotic locales" ("The Work of . . ." 6). As Mark Berrettini writes, "the narrative action of The Crocodile Hunter is all climax and success on the part of the protagonist" (para 19). Programs such as Monster Buck Moments and Man vs. Wild all empha- size this enthrallment with human actions in spaces designated as wilderness. The adventure-nature film's focus on a human protagonist, typi- cally a white male, who confronts nature as wilderness, often inhab- ited by wild animals, presents a host of questions about nature- human relationships that have been fleshed out by scholars in other contexts (see, for example, Callicott and Nelson, 1998). To explore the</page><page sequence="5">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 105 way adventure-nature films reiterate problematic dimensions of nature typed as distant, wild space, such as its messages about spe- cieism, racism, and classism, and to demonstrate how some films occasionally confront these dimensions, I turn to Being Caribou , a film that both conforms to the genre and challenges it. Just Another (albeit "Grand") Adventure-Nature Film? Karsten Heuer and Leanne Allison documented their trek both with Being Caribou and a book of the same name by Heuer. Both texts use popular rhetoric that cordons nature off from the human world. Heuer worked as a park warden and traveled to remote areas of Canada such as the Ivvavik National Park, where he first encoun- tered the Porcupine caribou herd. Upon his return from one trip, he wrote: I reentered what seemed another world. Trucks zipped back and forth on the dusty main street, while on the outskirts of the Native town of 3,000 people, men coiled rolls of seismic cables in fenced compounds filled with heavy machinery. ... It was as though I'd crossed a line somewhere, a line that separated the busy node of human enterprise from the rhythms of the natural world and the best I could do to lessen that boundary was read as much as possible about the animals that had so entranced me just days before. (14) The film Being Caribou takes a similar approach, depicting nature as an antipode of the "busy node of human enterprise/' a distant and different world requiring an adventurous approach. Heuer speaks of following the caribou to Allison as "a grand adventure." Allison, "no stranger to executing a grand adventure," is excited at the prospect, and the exchange ends with her turning to Heuer "with a smile" and the words, "When do we leave?" (Heuer 14). Early in the film, there is a shot of Heuer and Allison poking their heads from the front of their tent, with the following exchange: Heuer: (tired) We are trying to be caribou, we aren't being caribou. (Pause) Following caribou, being left behind by caribou. Allison: (grinning) It's still pretty damn exciting, though. Heuer and Allison are presented as individuals competing with natural forces to survive. At one point, hoping to obtain some post- calving aggregation shots of the caribou, Allison and Heuer hurry to</page><page sequence="6">106 ISLE where they think the herd will gather. Soon they realize they have picked the wrong spot and have missed their opportunity. Allison notes, laughing, "I can't help thinking about a week ago when we were in an adventure-race: the eco-challenge with the caribou." Later, during an encounter with a hungry bear, Allison intersperses shots of bears with footage of her and Heuer ensconced in their tent. As the bear trails them, Heuer tries various techniques such as setting off a firecracker to deter it, but to no avail. Finally, impulsively, Heuer grabs their tent and raises it above his head; this scares the bear away. Allison ends her description of the scene by saying, "I felt totally overwhelmed . . . and scared." Heuer continues, "I was just thinking, forget the caribou, it just isn't worth it. Forget the project, forget this trip. . . ." And Allison adds, "Here we are going to the calving grounds with a bunch of bears. This is nuts." Ultimately, Being Caribou was presented as an adventure narrative- according to the catalog of the distributor, Bullfrog Films, "During the five-month journey, [Allison and Heuer] ski and hike across mountains, swim icy rivers, brave Arctic weather, and endure hordes of mosquitoes. They survive an encounter with a hungry grizzly bear that forces them to reconcile what it means to be part of true wilderness." The adventure narrative earned the film significant attention at film festivals, such as the Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival (which advertises itself as "a fine festival of climbing and adventure programs"), and in media reviews. National Geographic heralded the film as "an adventure that brought [Heuer and Allison] face to face with wolves, grizzlies, voracious mosquitoes, and Arctic blizzards" (Bullfrog Films). In essence, Being Caribou enacts what scholars such as Vivanco and Berretini characterize as the Crocodile Hunter-e sque "Danger! Danger! Danger!" thrill of adventure-nature films, which in turn draws from the historic legacy of a broader popular nature discourse that extols wilderness spaces and the encounters humans can have with wild animals in such spaces. Depicting nature as something "out there" to visit, play in, or conquer feeds into the cultural logic of capital. Adapting Frederic Jameson's concept, Carl Talbot explains, "Those efforts of capital to manage a relation to nature in the sphere of consumption result in nature as a 'stylized spectacle' packaged for easy consumption" (327). And as neatly packaged products, films too often promote a culture of consumption, particularly as they are essentially "spectacles" of nature. Being Caribou falls into this trap. It directs audiences to consume nature as something sublime, something adventurously dangerous, and exotically distant from their everyday lives. Its</page><page sequence="7">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 107 sponsorship by enterprises such as Backpacker Magazine, Arcteryx Clothing, and Mountain Equipment Co-op reinforces the consumer- ism that is inherent in adventure-nature narratives. It also reiterates what Mark Berretini has characterized as "adven- ture activism- representations that mingle wildlife conservation with dangerous, exciting, and sometimes violent human-animal interac- tions" (par. 24). In doing so, it draws on a long legacy of cultural fas- cination that viewers have with what separates (and connects) the human-animal from other species.2 More immediately, by placing this cultural fascination within contemporary environmental dis- course, Being Caribou explicitly makes a political plea for conserva- tion. As Allison states, the film's purpose is "to make a difference. That by bringing alive the story of the caribou, people will finally realize what's at stake. And they'll care." Their message was heralded by film critics. Reviewers on TheFilmConnection, a national public film library, wrote glowingly about the film. A viewer from the Omaha Independent Media Center wrote: "Truly a respectful glimpse into wildness largely unseen by human eyes. Anyone who has heard of or read about the issues surrounding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge should view this film." Another viewer, from NWRO Sustainability in Seattle, wrote: "We all got attached to the two Canadian filmmakers and to the Caribou. A political film . . . ." The film's appeal is both in its story of two humans surviving in the wil- derness as they encounter wild animals in their natural habitat and in its rejection of politics that threaten such encounters. Throughout the film, Heuer and Allison carry a small doll of George W. Bush, which is seen on their dashboard, on a backpack, and in the snow, and pro- vides both a compelling sense of political urgency and ironic comedy as the American President seems thoroughly out of place. As Being Caribou portrays wilderness in the "danger" tradition of many adventure-nature films, it also complicates some of the wilder- ness and specieist tropes employed by such films. In the next section, I explore this theme by examining Heuer and Allison's use of therio- morphism and the technique's effects on the adventure-nature narrative. Not Quite as Virtuous: Theriomorphic Interactions with Nature In "The Work of Environmentalism in the Age of Televisual Adventures," anthropologist Luis Vivanco suggests that adventure- nature films are often "virtuous." He elaborates that screen adven- turers such as Steve Irwin, Martin and Osa Johnson, and Charles</page><page sequence="8">108 ISLE Akeley among others present "virtuous" adventures both "because of their self-conscious moral piety and even more so in terms of the word's root meaning, of their potent virility." Such adventurers claim that their exploits further the good of nature, but they also combine "a certain solidarity and sympathy for animals [or their ecosystems] with masculine authority over them" (7). Even as Irwin and others of this ilk argue for the conservation of what they type as dangerous animals, they also talk about (and to) these creatures in patronizing terms. For example, Mark Berrettini writes in his assessment of Crocodile Hunter, "In Irwin's performance, grabbing an animal for viewers becomes an odd assertion of ownership until he releases the animal, sometimes into the wild and sometimes into a captive habitat" (par. 29). In addition, Irwin often refers to the animals he asserts authority over in anthropocentric terms; for example, a snake is described in terms of almost sexual endearment: "ooo, she's a beauty, yes she is" and a tarantula as a "sweetheart" ( Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course). As scholars such as Daston and Mitman have pointed out, there is an undeniable conservation and ecological worth to such Irwin-esque anthropocentrism as this is a type of anthropomorphism, which in turn is important in connecting humans with animals- "the widen- ing of the circle of empathy and sympathy to include seals and ele- phants, whales and wolves, has altered both the subjective experience of identification with others and also its objective expres- sion, as measured by contributions to organizations like the World Wildlife Fund" (5). However, such contemporary scholars would readily agree that Irwin-esque/anthropocentric anthropomorphism also has its problems.3 Here, on-screen portrayals set up hierarchical distinctions between the masculine adventurer and the femininized animal in ways that objectify nature and emphasize it as inherently dichotomous. In effect, wild nature is portrayed as both distinct and yet familiarly subordinate to an elite few who demonstrate their own exceptional prowess in adventuring in wild places. Like Crocodile Hunter, Being Caribou also celebrates the idea of humans adventuring in wild nature, but it lacks the bravado of virile mastery and thus, it escapes Vivanco's category of virtuosity and arrogant egotism. Instead, Heuer and Allison's "being caribou" align more closely with the sentiments of a different breed of nature film narratives such as those depicted in biographical films like Never Cry Wolf (1984; about Farley Mowat) and Gorillas in the Mist (1988; about Dian Fossey), and science documentaries such as Jane Goodall: Reason for Hope (2000). In these films, the narrative rests less on the thrill of being in the wilderness than in the complexities of conservation.</page><page sequence="9">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 109 Here instead of asserting control over the animals, the protagonists, who are often ethologists, demonstrate a more humbling respect for their animal counterparts by not necessarily highlighting competition as is typical in adventure-nature films but by centralizing collabora- tion. These protagonists celebrate wild nature (like Irwin does) but in more equitable and reciprocal ways by adopting and adapting to animal-social interactions. Such adaption can serve as a way to tra- verse the species divide as individuals partake in what might be termed a Deleuzian-Gauttarian process of "becoming animal." Many animal scholars have noted Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's words: "To become animal is to participate in move- ment ... to cross a threshold, to reach a continuum of intensities that are valuable only in themselves, to find a world of pure inten- sities where all forms come undone" (Deleuze and Guattari 13); and have argued that these speak to a way individuals can redraw species boundaries (see, for example, Lippit, Brown, DeKowan, and Baker). Lori Brown writes "when we become animal, we shift from this majoritarian position [of humans as dominant] into the location of the other animal. Already, at the outset, then, this becoming poses a challenge to a system that enables us to establish a binary grounded in the human domination of the animal" (237). 4 While adventurers such as Irwin might lament how humans as a species tend to dominate other animals, they rarely if ever on screen relinquish their own personal sense of superiority over the animals they encounter. In contrast, ethologists such as Fossey, Mowat, and Goodall (along with, one might argue, a host of others such as Iain Douglas-Hamilton and Cynthia Moss) do often articulate a more humble relationship. For example, Mitman writing about Iaian Douglas-Hamilton's work with elephants remarks: "It is curious, yet perhaps not unsurprising, that an article published in Psychology Today in the early 1970s referred to Iain Douglas-Hamilton as an anthropologist. But had elephants become human or had he become elephant? This was always the danger of going native" ("Pachyderm Personalities" 185). Even as Mitman's quote serves to point out the reciprocal relation- ship that Douglas-Hamilton had with the elephants he lived amongst, it is also useful to point out that ethologists do also resort to an anthropomorphism that involves some level of human imposi- tion on the animals (for example, through the act of naming individ- ual animals).5 In comparison, and this is what seems to set Being Caribou uniquely apart in the adventure-nature genre, Heuer and Allison's recorded experiences signify a "becoming-animal" that relinquishes all authority of the "anthropos." Being Caribou is</page><page sequence="10">110 ISLE depicted primarily as a story of theriomorphism- of humans cross- ing the species divide in a way that seems effectively to challenge any notion of human dominance. In this film, humans surrender all sem- blance of authority over nature; nature takes complete control. As Allison and Heuer ease into their trek, they find themselves constantly adjusting to the demands of the physical environment that surrounds them. First, there are the bodily aches and pains of getting used to hiking with all their equipment. Later, haggard looking Heuer says: "We're at day 16 or 17 now and most- well, a lot- of our aches and pains have left, and we started thinking we were getting used to the heavy packs but what's happened in exchange for that is that we are always hungry. We're hungry in the morning when we wake up, we are hungry when we eat breakfast, we are hungry all day, we are hungry right after we eat dinner; we are hungry when we go to bed. . . . " And the couple is not the driving force of their journey, as Heuer explains: "Our movements are being dictated by caribou, whose movements are being dictated by bugs, whose move- ments are being dictated by the wind/' The caribou serve as a driving force and are rarely personalized in a vein common to Irwin-esque adventurers or the work of ethologists. Instead, Heuer and Allison respond to the caribou in a more collec- tive, empathetic way as is seen from the following sequence narrated by Allison whispering as she looks from her cramped spot in their tent out at the caribou calving grounds at the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Since we arrived about five days ago, we've literally been hostages in the tent. Since there've been caribou around we've literally been peeing in cups inside the tent, you know. Go without water for long periods of time just for fear of disturbing them. In fact, if we do go outside and if they do see any movement they'll spook and the whole group will leave. . . . They are as fragile as glass right now. We've been walking on egg shells the whole time just so as not to disturb them. Such emotional responses to the threats that face the caribou generate sympathy for the animals without necessarily imposing human char- acteristics on them. What happens instead in Being Caribou is that the caribou and their environs seem to take over the humans. As Heuer and Allison become more immersed in their environment, they find themselves abandoning any semblance of authority over their own lives, let alone over nature. On the postcalving migration, as the caribou cows increase their pace to catch up to the bulls, Heuer and</page><page sequence="11">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 111 Allison abandon their schedule- eight hours of walking alternated with eight hours of sleep- to keep up with the herd. This decision instigates a change in Heuer and Allison's experience of life. Accompanying shots of the caribou walking, which are interspersed with shots of the two humans walking, are Heuer and Allison's voice-overs: Heuer: For seven days we've been immersed in a new rhythm. We follow caribou day and night, and squeeze naps in when we can and eat on the fly. Allison: An incredible thing is happening. We are being pulled into a different measure of time, where the line between the waking world and the dream world begins to blur. In both book and film, Heuer describes the dream-like quality as a state of letting go, almost hallucinogenic or shamanistic. Physically exhausted, the couple begins to conflate rational consciousness with voices and visions that take control. Consequently, their relationship to their immediate environment and the caribou changes: "Regardless of what it was, a shift had happened: the tortoise-and-hare race we'd had with the caribou in spring was over; competitors had become companions. With the sheep watching from a ridge, we took our position in the parade of animals, following caribou followed by the grizzly, sharing the same challenges and fears" (Heuer 167). Unlike Irwin-style adventurers, whose relationship to wilderness spaces always involves taking control and thus maintaining hierarchi- cal relationships between species, Heuer and Allison relinquish all control; and they seem to go one step further than Fossey-like protag- onists, who begin to up-end species hierarchies. Such submersion of self in the animal-other is compelling to viewers who wish to recon- nect with their ecological roots. Audiences are often fascinated by such narratives because theriomorphism seem so antithetical to modern living. At one level, viewers are drawn in by the "you must be crazy to attempt this" factor; at another level, as a long cultural legacy suggests, narratives of such submersions are often seen as one of the best ways to instill a workable environmental ethic toward nature because they foreground human humility.6 However, even as Heuer and Allison's "being caribou" challenge conventional species boundaries in ways that are potentially ecologi- cally productive, the film paradoxically makes human boundaries problematic. Specifically, Heuer and Allison's theriomorphism falls prey to a racial dimension within the Euro-American cultural</page><page sequence="12">112 ISLE discourse of wilderness places and animality: the representation of native peoples. In addition, this filmic narrative of interspecies trans- formations does little to subvert consumerist longings to desire for adventure in wild places and maintains classist hierarchies. The Trouble with Being Caribou: Native American Appropriations As outlined by myriad scholars such as William Cronon and Ramachandra Guha, the history of wilderness discourse is laden with troubling racist attitudes. Early American wilderness advocates such as Thoreau and John Muir, as well as those who established the coun- try's national park system, often saw Native Americans as ignoble savages, incapable of appreciating land conservation; indigenous people were dispossessed of their lands to confirm a sense of wilder- ness as unpeopled space. Later advocates such as Robert Marshall and those he influenced (the founding members of The Wilderness Society) were usually less contemptuous of native people. However, their understandings often forwarded reductive "ecological Indian" stereotypes, which also served to denigrate these communities. Contemporary wilderness discourse is still burdened with such his- torical Euro-American understandings of native peoples (Cronon; Adamson; Sneed; Spence). Expressions of these understandings can be found in Being Caribou. Though a story primarily about two white people sojourning with the caribou, the narrative is bracketed at either end by encounters with the Gwich'in Athabascan Indians of Old Crow, Canada. It is important to note that in their creation story, the Gwich'in are described as descendants of the caribou. The people's connection to the caribou is so strong -the story goes- that they retain a part of the caribou heart and the caribou in turn retain a part of the Gwich'in heart. However, the film neglects to explicitly describe its own relation to this story.7 Although the Gwich'in origins of Heuer and Allison's project can be excavated from the film, such references are few and far between in comparison to the many that emphasize the wilderness-as-adventure experience of the two white protagonists, and these are more allusions than direct references. For example, there is scene of mountains and caribou, where the voice-over is of Randall Tetlichi of Old Crow: "The caribou spirit lives north of Old Crow; he lives in the mountain. There's a big hole in the mountain. Chief Grandfather Caribou lives here. He tells the caribou, 'Go feed the people, go clothe the people ... go look after the people, go dance</page><page sequence="13">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 113 with the people . . . Y' Later, while Allison and Heuer are following the post-calving herd, struggling with sleep deprivation and caught in a dream-like state, Heuer says, "This is the first time we truly understand Randall's advice. We both start having vivid dreams of where we will see caribou next and then we turn the corner and there they are, the exact same way we dreamt them." As the film articulates, survival in wilderness spaces requires adapting to the region's natural rhythms. Though this philosophy aligns with that of Native cultures such as the Gwich'in, it is equally grounded in Western wilderness ideas. Being Caribou appears to mar- ginalize the Native influence with its focus on two white individuals adventuring in the wilderness. In addition, even if taken as a tribute to the Gwich'in creation story, Being Caribou promotes the Gwich'in as ecological Indians in its appropriation of this image for Allison and Heuer's transformative experience, thereby reducing Gwich'in experiences to a stereotype. Randall Tetlichi is the most prominent Gwich'in featured in the film, and he is heard primarily in voice- overs. At the beginning, as he explains about the caribou spirit, the camera follows his snowmobile's shadow across the snow. At film's end, he speaks the last words (articulating the Gwich'in philosophy of connection to the land), but the camera cuts to the migrating caribou. In the few other scenes where the Gwich'in people speak, their voices are faded out in favor of Allison and Heuer's voice-overs. The book includes Heuer's description of an incident with James Itsi where the latter tries to articulate a less simplistic relationship to the land than that of ecological Indian: "He wanted to seize his chance to set us straight: Old Crow was more than a quaint village of caribou hunters, he told me, and the issue of whether or not to develop for oil and gas wasn't as clear-cut as we thought" (34). But in the film, while James Itsi is introduced in the beginning at an Old Crow gath- ering, viewers don't hear or see from him again. His voice, a dissent from the stereotype, is omitted from the film. Though there may be many technical or logistic reasons for omitting Itsi from the hunt that he and Randall took the couple on,8 the absence also of the Inupiat from the village of Kaktovik suggest that some of these reasons were editorially geared to cut the particular dissenting context of these voices. While Heuer's book documents a stop in Kaktovik and acknowl- edges the help they received from a Kaktovik couple, Walt and Merilyn Audi, these experiences are missing from the film. In the book, Heuer reveals that trying to interview an Inupiat elder and the mayor results in "a dire need for inspiration" (122). Disappointed with their interviewees' attitudes- "I held my tongue, reminding</page><page sequence="14">114 ISLE myself that we were soliciting an opinion, not entering into an argu- ment" (118)- and troubled by the town's seedy appearance, Heuer and Allison were eager to leave. Heuer includes this journal entry in his book: May 30-Kaktovik, Alaska- I don't know who or what to believe anymore. Nothing is as straightforward or openly honest as it was with the caribou. Overnight millionaires importing more plastic, more engines, more fuel- more things to promote the uncoupling of humans from their natural surroundings- while the piles of garbage and contaminated soil continue to build. . . . (120-21) His distress is plain. Though these people, much like Itsi, are men- tioned in his book, they do not warrant attention in a film that sug- gests that one of the best ways to live is not only coupled with wild land but also at its mercy. Thus, even modern Gwich'in like Itsi and Randall who live off the land appear to be imperfect residents of the Earth. Unlike the caribou they "crave flesh and grease and need to go out killing things."9 Immediately following Randall's voice-over about the caribou spirit, the film presents the Gwich'in hunting scene. In long shot, we see the caribou herd moving across the white landscape; traditional Gwich'in music (drum beats and vocals) fills the soundtrack. The scene cuts to a medium shot of Randall crouching patiently behind his bright yellow Skidoo, the gun balanced on its seat, then back to a long shot of the caribou. The music is silenced jarringly by the crack of a gunshot; then we see a lone caribou collapsing in the snow, its dying grunts audible as another shot pierces the air. Though Allison and Heuer are in awe of Randall's deft skinning of the dead caribou, they themselves do not kill or skin or butcher unless in extreme cir- cumstances (toward the end of their trip, Heuer kills a ground squir- rel for food after four days of hunger). Nor do they use snowmobiles, guns, or other technology that the modern-day Inupiat or Gwich'in use; the tools in the wilderness are those of the backpacker, the classic "visitor who leaves no trace." If the Gwich'in creation story is an exemplar of ecological living- where caribou and people are as one- then Allison and Heuer have appropriated this story, arguably to celebrate it. But the native origins of the story are subsumed into a dominant Western narrative. The predominant conceptual framework of Being Caribou more closely resembles what Candace Slater calls "Edenie narratives" where "pre- sentations of the natural or seemingly natural landscape in terms that</page><page sequence="15">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 115 consciously- or, more often , unconsciously- evoke the Biblical account of Eden" (115). Writing of their ultimate epiphany- being able to walk in perfect harmony with the caribou- Heuer states: "We had broken free from the textbook mentality that separated the world into needs, wants, and resources and had returned to a younger, sweeter version of what was possible in life" (197). Slater explains that there are two types of Edenie stories: "The first sort is directly linked to the account of Adam and Eve that appears in Genesis. This story presup- poses an initial state of harmony and perfection in which human beings live as one with other divine creations" (115). Allison and Heuer, walking in harmony with the caribou, evoke this image. In general, the film is replete with images shot in soft focus or backlit, conveying a haloed, gentle, and divine sense of wilderness spaces. In their reference to an older, bitter world characterized by "needs, wants and resources," they also evoke the second type of Edenie story, or what Slater calls the "after-Eden" story, that "highlights nos- talgia for the perfect past or deep fears about continuing loss. Such stories may imply hopes for the rediscovery of paradise (the recovery, for instance, of an original state of innocence and plenty through a return to nature)" (116). Categorizing wilderness stories as "after-Eden" stories points out the peculiarly Euro-American slant on nature. Though many world cultures have stories about a different, and oftentimes more harmo- nious, relationship between nonhuman nature and humans, they do not establish the Edenie past as the antithesis of the fallen present. James Ruppert and John Bernet explain that Athabascan stories fall into three general categories: distant-time or origin era stories where animal-human identities are in flux; transformative era stories where animals and humans have fixed identities but still interact freely; and historical era stories, which are primarily about known people and their actions. Some readers might perceive this chronological presen- tation as a model of cultural progress from an animal world to human culture or as fall from an idealized paradise. Neither of these interpretations is accurate. The stories explain the changes in the world in a very nonjudgmental manner, highlighting valuable knowl- edge. They tell of the natural and foreordained proc- esses of the world without the constrictions of Westerns definitions of Good and Evil or the concept of evolu- tion. (12)</page><page sequence="16">116 ISLE But Allison and Heuer's narrative is judgmental. It conjures a simpler way of life, and it wrestles with the distress of being a product of the modern world. Both these themes are grounded in the Western wil- derness tradition. As Cronon writes, "The critique of modernity that is one of environmentalism's most important contributions to the moral and political discourse of our time more often than not appeals, explicitly or implicitly, to wilderness as a stand against which to measure the failings of our human world. Wilderness is the natural Unfällen antithesis of an unnatural civilization that has lost its soul" (80). Only by denying one's human tendencies, Being Caribou implies, can one be pure and innocent again- like the "humble caribou" and wild spaces that they roam. If this is the case, then contemporary Gwich'in such as Randall, no matter how ecologically aware, fail to live the pure life. And the less ecologically focused Natives, such as the Kaktovik Inupiat and James Itsi, serve no purpose in this story about reclaiming a lost space where humans are enmeshed in the vast web of life. Only the human-caribou Gwich'in of the distant past figure in this story of theriomorphic transformations, where humans get absorbed into nature. And their words are subsumed into a Euro- American narra- tive, and thereby effaced. Conclusion The cultural idea of wilderness as a discourse that makes space for ecological sustainability as well as racially just environmental action continues to generate discussion (as in the recent edited collec- tions, Michael Lewis's American Wilderness: A New History, and Callicott and Nelson's The Wilderness Debate Rages On). The limita- tions and potentials of this idea have been recognized in historic film and alluded to in contemporary film.10 In my analysis of Being Caribou , I highlight the dilemmas of the adventure-nature film as a space for mediating the current complexities of the wilderness idea as it engages conceptions of animals and humans. Many nature docu- mentary filmmakers wrestle with how to conform to the expectations audiences have of film form and genre- a film must entertain as it educates, and it must do so within an hour or two. In addition, a suc- cessful film must usually meet its audience's genre expectations while also providing a unique context that appears fresh and compelling. While Being Caribou revises the adventure-nature genre's tendency to "virile virtuosity," and counters traditional tropes of specieism, it also presents a story of adventure-nature that fuels consumerist</page><page sequence="17">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 117 recreational activities, both through recreational spectatorship and through its message to idealize wilderness as penultimate natural space. Because culture is subsumed into, and presented as antithetical to, nature (as humans "become caribou"), the film masks places where nature and contemporary cultures co-exist. For example, while the Gwich'in and the biblical Eden creation stories are evoked to demonstrate mythical land ethics, the film squirms at the contempo- rary Gwich'in's reliance on mechanized hunting and at the city envi- ronments of Inuvik in the Northwest Territories (where Heuer returns from his warden duties), and of Washington, DC (where the couple go to lobby for wilderness preservation). Its portrayal of human-nature dichotomies fuels a disdain for the spaces of tame natural environments and encourages a hunger for wilderness spaces. Such effects can be detrimental to ecological sustainability as audiences fail to see the connections between nature conservation in the wilderness and their everyday capitalist, consumerist urban or suburban lives. Furthermore, Being Caribou's sidelining of native influences and its strong focus on the adventure story of two Euro- Americans makes it easy for viewers to overlook native repre- sentations or to simplify them. Such reductionist portrayals are par- ticularly problematic when confronting the reality of native experiences as they engage in political battles concerning wilderness preservation (Harkin and Lewis; Krech). Heuer and Allison are themselves no strangers to the complex- ities of the wilderness idea. As a park warden for the Canadian national park system, Heuer readily acknowledges the problems of wilderness adventure recreation (Heuer, ASLE plenary presenta- tion). And in no way do he and Allison callously intend to appro- priate the Gwich'in creation story or deliberately marginalize Native voices. As Heuer's book states, the couple are indebted to the Gwich'in and to the Inupiat. However, in an effort to make a com- mercially viable film, Heuer and Allison adhere to the generic con- vention of an adventure narrative, steeped in a strong Euro-American wilderness idea. While strategically geared to partic- ular audiences, this choice does little to counter classist and racist tropes. From the typical venues at which the film was screened, environmental, wildlife, and mountain film festivals, one can infer that most of the audience is of Euro-American descent and well- versed in some form of wilderness rhetoric. For example, its screen- ing at MountainFilm at Telluride, Colorado, is telling. The festival describes its goal in the following words: "Our goal of highlighting the uniqueness of wild spaces is achieved through a balanced program chosen for its adventurous, cultural and social content.</page><page sequence="18">118 ISLE Therefore, MountainFilm accepts and screens films on a broad range of subjects that include but are not limited to mountains and mountain sports." Words such as "cultural and social" suggest that ideas of wild spaces as isolated from culture are slowly changing. However, words such as "adventurous" and "sports" also warn of the more traditional wilderness mentality. Wild spaces remain a playground and a recreational site for wealthy people to escape to. The fact that festival passes range in price from $5000 (for life membership) to $110 (for six shows) and individual tickets at $20 confirms the elite clientele of this particular audience (MountainF ilm) . Not all of Being Caribou's audience is as wealthy as the MountainFilm audience, as the film was also shown for free by the Arctic Wilderness League at its campaign sites. However, once again, even these audiences are usually already invested in a Euro-American cultural legacy of wilderness rhetoric that often blinds them to the consumerist or racist implications of such adven- ture activism. To their credit, Heuer and Allison have often paired screenings of the film with presentations that flesh out the complex- ities of their wilderness adventure's context (for example, ASLE plenary presentation). In these presentations, the couple's more nuanced understanding of nature-culture(s) relationships compen- sates for the film's limitations, allowing for political messages of conservation, in wilderness spaces and in the spaces of individuals' city backyards, and for more complex understanding of racial justice to occupy a more central position compared to a traditional recreational-adventure theme. Because making a film professionally involves concerted economic effort (in the investment of production equipment specifically) and because the ultimate success of film depends on a resonance between producers and audiences who are equally caught up in specific cul- tural contexts, making a film that revises and re-visions generic expectations takes courage on the part of filmmakers, and creativity on the part of both filmmakers and audiences. Ultimately, Being Caribou makes space for re-visioning the genre somewhat by steering away from more prominent narratives of virile virtuosity and contex- tually (if not textually) by acknowledging the complexity of nature- culture and culture-culture relationships. HoWever, it doesn't easily escape criticisms leveled more generally at adventure-recreation dis- course and leaves room for scholars and filmmakers alike to consider how the genre of adventure-nature films can be challenged to convey messages of wilderness in ways that speak both for long-term ecolog- ical sustainability and for racial justice.</page><page sequence="19">Wilderness Discourse in Adventure-Nature Films 119 Notes 1. For more on the history of the American environmental movements' involvement with visual imagery as a campaign tool, consider Finis Dunaway's Natural Visions. While the film itself depicts how the filmmakers sought out the Alaska Wilderness League to share their film as a political tool, there is unfortu- nately currently little other written documentation about this process of col- laboration. This author did attempt to contact the League to talk to individuals who assisted but did not have much success in finding a knowl- edgeable interviewee. There was one paper by Shirley Roburn that was pre- sented at ASLE's conference in 2011 that does provide this context (see ASLE program, 2011). The results on a discussion group on Google called Arctic Action provide some sense of these various screenings in its threads about a number of events where Being Caribou was shown in 2005 across the country. Arctic Action describes itself as: "We are a group concerned with protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Our goal is to organize events that educate about this important issue and that encourage political action. Join this group and help us organize events for our national day of action: March 12, Arctic Action Day." (They are accessible at http://groups.google.com/group/ ArcticAction/topics?start=30&amp;sa=N.) 2. There is a growing body of research that examines human-animal rela- tionships in film. Chris's Watching Wildlife and Allison Daston and Gregg Mitman's Thinking with Animals are useful because they provide an excellent comprehensive sense of animal studies scholarship. See for example, Daston and Mitman's footnote 3 on page 13; see also Chris's footnote 20 on page 213; also the introduction of Sarah McFarland and Ryan Hediger's 2009 edited collection Animals and Agency. 3. The point of Daston and Mitman's edited text is to examine the idea of anthropomorphism and to expand it beyond conventional understandings that often type it is as a "term of reproach, both intellectual and moral" (2). As they state, anthropomorphism is a "fact" (6)- "we are animals; we think with animals" (1). Instead of simply chastising its use, examining how and why we do so helps us answer questions such as "what is it good for, and how is it done?" (6). In thinking about "how is it done," Daston and Mitman remind readers that conceptions of anthropomorphism evoke not only "the performance of being human by animals" but also its opposite, that of "being animal by humans," and everything in-between (6). And, in exploring questions of "what is it good for," one must also be aware of what it might not be so good for, which enables me to assert that these scholars readily rec- ognize the downsides to anthropomorphism even as they celebrate its benefits. 4. Many scholars also acknowledge that Deleuze and Gauttari's philo- sophical musings on "becoming animal" are complex and were not necessa- rily intended to highlight the agency of animals as much as to challenge human institutions. For example, Steve Baker writes: "Animals, for Deleuze</page><page sequence="20">120 ISLE and Guattari, seem to operate more as a device of writing . . . than as living beings whose conditions of life were of direct concern to the writers" (95). Despite this anthropocentric focus, many animal studies scholars appreciate the potential of the concept to explore ethical relationships with animals and have indeed done so, providing a useful theoretical framework in animal studies (see references already cited) 5. For discussions of this type of reciprocality concerning Mowat, see, for example, Karen Jones's Never Cry Wolf: Science , Sentiment and Literary Rehabilitation of Canis Lwpis ; concerning Goodall, see, for example, Marianne DeKoven's Women, Animals, and Jane Goodall : Reason for Hope. In all cases, scholarship recognizes the value of humans adapting animal characteristics and the value of humanizing animals. 6. Much has been written about narratives of humans submerging them- selves in nature. For a good example, see Karen Jones's Never Cry Wolf that references a literary tradition that highlights early environmental writers such as Ernest Thompson Seton and John Muir to more recent ones such as Farley Mowat. 7. The influence that the Gwich'in story has on the couple is clearer in the book than in the film. For example, early in the book Heuer states: "The 123,000 member Porcupine Herd, it turns out, is the most well studied caribou herd in the world and I found no shortage of reports, books, maps to pore over in the evenings . . . and for relief from all the numbers, I often fin- ished the evenings with a Native story or poem" (15). Also, Heuer recounts the enthusiasm that greets his plan at Old Crow and the words of an old man who talked to him about the caribou's migrations. Heuer quotes the man, "Back then people could talk to caribou, and caribou could talk to people" (26). 8. For example, Allison (with her camera) was not present when Itsi decided to share his thoughts. And Itsi may have re-evaluated his words later when Allison's camera was rolling, as Heuer's book suggests: "The tension that had clouded James's face before the hunt had lifted. He was beaming. 'This is what matters now/ he said, hefting a chunk of meat in his hand. 'This is what it means to be Indian'" (39). Perhaps too the Gwich'in Renewable Resource Board that helped sponsor the film vetoed Itsi's voice because it was more interested in the strategic and political value of keeping up the official Gwich'in stance toward the Refuge than in sharing some of the complexity and ambivalence individual community members express. Certainly, as the website of the Gwich'in Steering Committee, the main body organized by the community to respond to the Refuge debate, states, the community decided to "speak in one voice" against "oil and gas develop- ment in the birthing and nursing grounds of the Porcupine River caribou herd." 9. Allison's description of the caribou in the film includes the observation that they do not "crave flesh and grease and need to go out killing things." 10.
