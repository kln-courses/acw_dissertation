Our Beautiful, Dry, and Distant Texts, On Pictures and the Words That Fail Them and Why Are Our Pictures Puzzles? critically analyze various recent attempts to relate visual artifacts and texts. The Object Stares Back and What Painting Is offer constructive ways of understanding the physical reality of paintings in ways that transcend the usual approaches of recent commentators. Elkins, Associate Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, is interested in the relationship between words and pictures. He wants to explain the ways in which words and pic- tures differ, how they can be connected, and why some of the familiar accounts of the word-image relation tell only part of the whole story. It is important to grasp the unity of Elkins's concerns in order to see how his ideas fit together. It is difficult to grasp the unity of his ideas because he writes so much-but it is worth doing, for his claims are original and highly suggestive. Together with his earlier The Poetics of Perspective (Cornell University Press, 1994), his recently published Pictures of the Body: Pain and Metamorphosis (Stanford University Press), and his unpublished book on Chinese painting, these texts are the most ambitious and fully realized body of work by any younger art historian. His amazing achievement is sure to attract emulation, commentary, and criticism. Although Elkins is fluent in the fashionable language of art historical writing, his view of that way of thinking is at odds with that of his colleagues. Without seeming beleaguered, he offers a very different viewpoint from most of his contemporaries in art history. The Object Stares Back reconstructs Lacanian ideas about the nature of perception in a very accessible framework filled with intriguing examples. Vision, Elkins argues, is more complicated than common sense allows. Objects seem to look at us; and we, organizing our visual experience in terms of seeing bodies and faces in the world, find that there are some things too alien to us, too bright or too painful to get into focus. This is a frankly anthropomorphic way of looking-one whose relationship to scientific accounts of perception is hard to understand. Because Jacques Lacan is so hard to explain intelligibly, there is great value in this very lucid exposition. When Elkins describes how, in choosing our clothes, we aim to fit in or stand out, he provides the most helpful exposition I have found of Lacan's ideas. Is that worth doing? A philosopher friend, explaining tersely his problem with The Object Stares Back said, "the trouble is, it doesn't [do that]." Not entirely in agreement with him, I have sympathy with his reaction. Elkins works very hard to make Lacan's way of thinking plausible, but in the end it isn't clear if he succeeds. I hope that readers inspired by him will pursue this project. On Pictures and the Words That Fail Them argues that none of the recently much discussed semiotic theories of pictures are adequate. Neither Mieke Bal and Norman Bryson nor Nelson Goodman or Rosalind E. Krauss have entirely plausible accounts. Neither is Elkins satisfied with the various presentations by Ernst Gombrich and his critics of anti-semiotic theories of pictorial realism. Finding something of value in most of these approaches, Elkins thinks that none of them tell the entire story. Pictorial elements are both semiotic and nonsemi- otic. Turning to premodern, non-Western examples, he asks how we know if we are looking at pictures or at writing-and concludes that the dividing line here is not easy to establish. Perhaps there is no such thing as a pure picture. We bring to any image expectations formed from the read- ing of written materials. Our Beautiful, Dry, and Distant Texts treats art history writing as a form of writing. After some introductory philosophical observations, the least satisfactory part of the account, Elkins uses a discussion of Alexander Marshack's work with Paleolithic artifacts to ask how historians may appro- priately match words to visual things. A critical reading of my account, and of Donald Preziosi's, on the history of art his- tory introduces a number of case studies- an examination of conflicting interpreta- tions of Piero della Francesca's Flagellation, Chinese bronzes, the Brancacci Chapel, landscape gardening, and Panofsky on Albrecht Diirer. Far reaching, and always suggestive, the book does not entirely come together. The problems with Elkins's focus on the rhetoric of art history are revealed by his discussion of the much told story of Jacques Derrida's commentary on Meyer Schapiro's remarks about Martin Heidegger's observation about Vincent van Gogh's painting of shoes. Insofar as Heidegger used those shoes merely as an example, it is not clear why his error about the identity of the shoes shows that any- thing is wrong with his aesthetic theory. For Heidegger's purposes, it does not really matter whether the shoes belonged to the artist or to a peasant woman. No doubt this case study is fascinating to art histori- ans because it brings together such diverse personalities, and shows how personal interpretation can be. But does this elabo- rate, somewhat silly argument really show 114 SUMMER 2000</page><page sequence="2">anything about the validity of Heidegger's theorizing? According to a story I know only second hand, upon hearing Derrida lecture at Columbia University, Schapiro remarked, "I believe, with John Dewey, that there is something called truth." If only Schapiro had published that remark. What he said in print is disappointing. Able to rise to discussion of the larger issues, he refused to do so. No one who believes, as we philosophers do, that philosophical the- ories should be judged according to their truth will be entirely satisfied with Elkins's account of this debate. What Painting Is, the most deeply original of Elkins's books, argues that study of alchemy reveals a great deal about painting. Like alchemists, painters are interested in materials, and in ways of thinking which are hard to articulate intelligibly. Alchemists are not just pseudo-scientists; they can teach us about painting. Both alchemy and painting are concerned with self-knowledge. "Substances are like mirrors that let us see things about ourselves that we cannot quite understand" (45). In the telling of his stu- dents' experiences copying paintings, and looking at very close up details in the color plates, Elkins demonstrates how hard it is to describe the physical qualities of paint- ings. "Alchemists," he says, "sometimes got carried away naming nearly meaningless processes, or making endless lists" (145). And that is what Elkins often does, in both offering an intriguing account of the lore of alchemy, and describing his own laboratory experimentation. Admiring alchemy aesthet- ically, he is not centrally concerned with the truth of its claims. Elkins objects to semiotic theorizing, and has some sympathy with Lacan, because he thinks of painting as essentially a bodily art. Why Are Our Pictures Puzzles? looks at the tendency of recent art historians to be extremely loquacious. Why does Leo Steinberg have so much more to say about the art of Leonardo and Michelangelo than did Vasari? The accelerating complexity of art cannot be undone, for it reflects both our desire to say more and the practical needs of the profession. There are so many art historians, and they are expected to write prolifically. Elkins identifies a number of explanations for our tendency to treat pictures as puzzles: we believe that visual complexity is a good thing; we have a felt need to keep talking in order that pictures not be left without commentary; we suffer a deep anxiety, thinking that it may be impossible to adequately describe pictures in words; and we worry that pictures ulti- mately may be meaningless. When he calls Salvador Dali's The Tragic Myth of Millet's Angelus "the best work of twentieth-century art history . . . a superlative exercise in what the Renaissance called fantasia-that is, a genuine act of imagination" (243), you are aware of the wide range of his sympathies. He is unwilling to dismiss even the craziest theories as being without merit. Observing that already more has been written about some famous pictures than anyone has time to read, Elkins asks (but does not resolve) questions about how the profession of art history can now proceed. Elkins has read the theorists everyone knows, but he also has an amazing ability to identify obscure, out of the way sources, and a deeply impressive capacity to make unexpected connections. Few authors who write so much repeat them- selves so little. We philosophers like to resolve puzzles, seeking the best possible solution. Like a realist novelist, Elkins enjoys gathering things; it pleases him to display theories, visual examples, and refer- ences, multiplying hypotheses without closing off discussion. He loves making lists. The accumulated effect of his close readings constitutes a version of what literary critics call the reality effect-faced with so many texts, you can easily feel that we are getting close to the truth. You feel that Elkins likes playing with puzzles for their own sake-less because he wants to solve them than because he enjoys savoring them. Like the alchemists, Elkins is fasci- nated by messiness. If his books lack the elegance of analytic philosophy, they escape the obscurity of almost all French- style philosophy. Even a philosopher deeply frustrated by Elkins's refusal to come out with a conclu- sion, as I sometimes am, will find in these books an enormous amount of material worth engaging. Elkins is at his least inter- esting, I think, when as in Our Beautiful, Dry, and Distant Texts he summarizes texts, such as his description of Whitney Davis's review of Donald Preziosi with reference to Heidegger and Derrida, or his close com- mentary on an account by Norman Bryson and Richard Wollheim. Then Elkins gives the sense that art history is a text bound discipline. He is at his best when he offers constructive argument and when he looks directly at art. The central claim of Why Are Our Pictures Puzzles?, presented differently earlier, as he acknowledges, in my Principles of Art History Writing (1991), deserves further discussion. If you believe that pictures can be truthful- ly described, then the materials gathered in Why Are Our Pictures Puzzles? are depressing. There is so much talk, with so little resolu- tion. Art history seems to never reach the truth. But probably few art historians really believe that they can solve once and for all the puzzles they consider, for if they did they would not argue as they do. No doubt some art historians like to talk about the artist's intention, but once we see how speculative are reconstructions of artist's mental processes, that line of argument will not solve this problem. And so it is tempting to turn to an institutional theory of art history. Before art history became an academic subject, art history writers mostly were laconic; there was no place for complicated interpretations of pictures. But once the subject was based in the university, and museums became large public institutions, there was a need for much writing about visual art. Undergraduate students study popularized accounts; graduate students become professors by writing elaborate narratives. If a student becomes interested in pictures, she soon learns that in order to work within art history she must accept the conventions of that institution. Even such unusual figures as two of Elkins's heroes, Michael Fried and Leo Steinberg, mostly write in the house style of their profession. "I could never understand Michael's reasoning processes," one of his teachers told me; but Professor Fried, as much as any traditional art historian, I 15 art journal Reviews</page><page sequence="3">elaborately cites precedents and presents theorizing authorities in his highly person- al books. The best way to understand the practice of art historians is to consider the purpose of their activity. Art historians teach under- graduates, and provide a support system for the museum. If pictures were solvable puzzles, then open-ended debate would be impossible. But that no one desires. If pic- tures could be solved, what would the next generation of art historians do? And, given the general disbelief in truth by correspon- dence, few art historians believe that it would be possible to offer a "knock down" solution to any long-standing controversy. If we understand art history in these terms, it is natural to wonder how the discipline will change in the near future. How long will it be possible for more and more words to be devoted to an essentially fixed body of old master art? Perhaps soon art historians will devote much more attention to non-European art. Maybe contemporary art will be studied more intensively. Elkins sketches, but does not entirely accept such an institutional account. He thinks that the subject matter of art history, the nature of pictures, explains some fea- tures of its argumentation. But since essen- tially the same movement from simpler earlier interpretations to highly complex accounts can be found also in literary criticism, the specially visual features of artworks cannot explain the strategies of art historical argumentation. Either the history of interpretation involves movement towards truth or some- thing like the institutional theory must be true-I do not see any alternatives. This argument leads to a second point. Suppose, as Whitney Davis has proposed and as Elkins's account of the rhetoric of interpre- tation seemingly implies, the structure of art history involves a potential infinite regress. Each new reader brings a new per- spective to bear. When I write about Elkins on Derrida on Schapiro on Heidegger, we have Carrier (on Elkins (on Derrida (on Schapiro (on Heidegger)))), each reader responding to the earlier discussions. And if you, in turn, write on this subject, we then have you on (Carrier (on Elkins (on Derrida (on Schapiro (on Heidegger))))). The process will continue endlessly, for each new reader can bring a new perspec- tive to the discussion. But is this account correct? Is it not possible for you to read Heidegger, leaving aside your knowledge of what Carrier, Elkins, Derrida, and Schapiro claim about his arguments? Here we get to the deepest difference between analytic philosophers and present-day art historians, as Elkins characterizes them. Is it ever possible to see the picture itself, or read the text, without needing or wanting to take account of the mass of accumulated earlier commentaries? I have elsewhere several times argued against this claim. What now has changed my sense of things is, in part, my reaction to Elkins's books. Elkins is very smart, he loves to argue, and he reads and looks with great human sympathy. All of his books inspire produc- tive argument. Unwilling to close off dis- cussion, he is very good at opening up debate. Elkins's writings on theory are distinct contributions to the larger litera- ture. The Object Stares Back and What Painting Is make a more special contribution to art his- tory. Wandering in the Metropolitan, need- ing a break from looking at art, I went to the shop, purchased What Painting Is, and sat down and started to read. When then I got up again, the art looked different. Elkins's best writing teaches you how to look more closely and see more. Few authors aspire to do that-and even fewer succeed. David Carrier, a philosopher who writes art criti- cism, is a 1999/2000 Getty Scholar. Among his recent books are The Aesthete in the City: The Philosophy and Practice of American Abstract Painting in the 1980s (1994); High Art: Charles Baudelaire and the Origins of Modernism (1996); and The Aesthetics of Comics (1999).</page></plain_text>
