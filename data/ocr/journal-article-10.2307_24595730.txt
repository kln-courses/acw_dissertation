He did so in part through assertions of divine patronage and support, for he claimed special access to the Virgin Mary, as well as the power to intercede on behalf of the city with the great intercessor her self. From the pulpit - and, very soon, in print - he described a visionary journey to the Virgin's throne in Heaven, a journey he had even announced in advance.1 On this journey Savonarola brought with him, he alleged, an elaborate three-tiered crown, made by the Florentine people, which he presented to the Vir gin, whom he found seated on an elaborate throne adorned with precious stones.2 After graciously accepting the crown the Vir gin placed it on her own head and then promised a glorious future for Florence, though not without tribulation. She thereby authorized the friar's campaign to make the city of Florence the New Jerusalem - in short, to realize heaven on earth.3 The nerve center of this reformed urban world was the Dominican convent of San Marco where, from the summer of 1491, Savonarola pre sided as prior. Beginning the previous summer, at first at San Marco but later in the cathedral, he had enthralled and terrified swollen audiences with sermons on the Apocalypse, in which he roundly denounced the culture of humanism, including images</page><page sequence="2">Charles Burroughs of 'nude Venuses'.4 Even if they were not themselves in the au dience, the city's artists were doubtless aware of Savonarola's strictures, and saw themselves put on notice. Within the convent church of San Marco a large and mag nificent altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin [Fig. 1] would soon be installed, one of several images reflecting the intense Marian devotion practiced at the convent.5 Botticelli's San Mar co altarpiece has been long known to scholars, but it languished for many years out of public view and only relatively recently, following a major restoration, has it achieved its rightful place among many of the artist's greatest works on the wall of the Bot ticelli room in the Uffizi.6 It belongs to a series of highly inventive religious works, executed by Sandro Botticelli in the later 1480s into the 1490s, which stand out for their formal and iconographic complexity, but also for their dense pictorial rhetoric - this, as I argue below, is especially true of the San Marco altarpiece. In his recent monumental monograph on Botticelli's religious art, Damian Dombrowski devotes a penetrating discussion to this group of paintings that is necessarily basic to any further analy sis.7 In a series of publications Dombrowski has emphasized the importance for the religious as well as the visual culture of late fifteenth-century Florence of the infusion of Neo-Platonist ideas into Christian theology carried out by the philosopher Marsilio Fi cino, the Medici-funded translator of Plato and of many followers of Plato; indeed, Dombrowski locates the impact of Neo-Plato nism in religious art rather than in the 'mythologies' where it has traditionally been sought.8 With regard to Botticelli's religious paintings of the 1480s and early 1490s, Dombrowski stresses the influence of the religious-philosophical synthesis of Ficino himself as well as other leading figures in the circle around, or even including, Lorenzo de' Medici, notably Cristoforo Landino, the great interpreter of Dante and Vergil in a Neo-Platonist key (in fact, in the 1480s, in the same milieu alternate intellectual cur rents were gaining ground9). The San Marco altarpiece is, in Dombrowski's view, a striking manifestation of a religious climate tinged by Neo-Platonist ideas as filtered through the circle around Savonarola, which included intellectuals with longstanding links to Lorenzo il Magnifico. The main conduit between two at first sight very disparate cultural milieus was, Dombrowski suggests, the poet Girolamo Benivieni, Dante expert and close friend of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who was one of the first Florentine intellectuals to commit to Savonarola's reform program and who placed his considerable literary gifts at the friar's disposal. Indeed, he translated certain of Savonarola's Latin writings into the vernacular, mediating in this way between the convent and the city.10 As we will see, me diation was an important aspect of Botticelli's altarpiece, but of a very different kind. Dombrowski's focus on an adviser remote, in all probability, from the step-by-step drafting of the figures and scenes within the painting distracts attention from issues of facture and com munication that are central to this paper. Any sacred painting of the period was required to present images of, usually, holy per sonages and to give an idea of their importance in the religious cult and their place in hagiographical narratives. Botticelli's San Marco altarpiece is itself an outstanding example of such com munication, in part through the depiction of figures engaged in markedly diverse acts of visual communication; at the same time, I will argue, the painting self-consciously addresses the more general issue of what, in certain circumstances, can be verbally or visually communicated at all. In an apparent act of defiance, especially in view of the size and prominence of the painting, Botticelli abjures the illusionism and pictorial unity typical of 'Re naissance' art. Instead, in bringing before the viewer the sacred scene and associated figures, Botticelli deploys formal elements and even material in a way that also draws attention to their sym bolic connotations and semiotic force, i.e. to the nature as well as effects of the pictorial codes at work in the painting.11 Within the painting the contrast of the upper and lower sections supplies a structuring logic, dividing the narrative re presentation of an event, marked by strikingly non-realistic elements, from a non-narrative but more realistic array of fig ures that are themselves pictorial signs of a kind, but are also conspicuously engaged in the production of signs. Such signs involve, we might say, 'signing'12, i.e. the performance of more or less conventional gestures that, especially in association with various 'props' or attributes, convey meaning. At the same time, even if he discounted certain aspects of the new art of his time, Botticelli joined and in many ways exceeded his con temporaries in his interest in the expressive possibilities of the human body, and in exploiting the effect of physical presence of strongly characterized and life-like figures (or even in project ing agency on the part of these figures, as if to model, through synecdoche, the effect of the image itself).13 Communication in other words, was not just a matter of what certain figures did, or were represented as doing, but rather of their moral being and active potential.14 This had importance resonances in late fifteenth-century Florentine culture. For those of any education, the response to such figures would have been shaped by knowl edge of the concept of actio laid out in rhetorical treatises, some of which were quite basic and relatively commonly known. Actio involves the essential performative component of communica tion and persuasion on the part of an orator facing an audience; in this painting it has to do with the visual representation of such a performance.15 In supplementing and at times, we might sup pose, exceeding the verbal resources of rhetoric, actio is close ly related to the display in the courtroom and similar locations of 'proofs' in the form of objects and images, and even persons, that might more directly and powerfully affect an audience than 'mere' words.16 The late fifteenth-century reception of such ide as, however, was still impacted by belief in the inherent power of certain sacred objects, like the relics of a saint, a power that 10</page><page sequence="3">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 1.

In this instance, the problem was made more acute through the high ambition of the painter's task, that of representing heav en. To achieve this end Botticelli resorted to a new and highly sophisticated deployment, or perhaps rather evocation, of an older approach to the making of sacred images, one that in volved the use of gilded backgrounds, while at the same time he included figures that respond in contrasting ways to the event. These figures operate, accordingly, as intermediaries between the transcendent event and the beholder, who would, of course, have been stationed at a distance below the painting, especially the frankly anti-illusionistic upper part. In this and other ways, as discussed below, Botticelli suggests a separation of the be holder and his/her object of veneration. Such a procedure has, I will argue, unexpected resonances with at least part - rather an important part - of a famous Renaissance theory of visual representation, although in important respects it ran counter to prevailing practices as well as to recent theoretical accounts and accepted practices of picture making. Savonarola, Dante, Botticelli The San Marco altarpiece is, then, a complex and challenging painting, produced at the center of a developing cultural and religious vortex. We have no direct information about the recep tion of the work; in particular, we cannot know what Savonarola made of the painting, or indeed if he even gave it a moment's thought. However, the friar's own mystical vision of the ascent to heaven presents a clear alternative, with whatever degree of intentionality, to Botticelli's highly self-conscious representation. Certainly the friar's vision provides a simpler visualization of heaven itself and the path toward it, subject of course to control by the friar himself as a privileged - and largely self-appointed - intermediary between believers and the transcendent realm. This, he might well have thought, was not something to leave to the discretion of a painter or any other untrained in theology and lacking the requisite credentials. Sandro Botticelli executed the altarpiece between April 1490 and November 1492.18 In terms of its size alone, it was a major undertaking; it is, for example, markedly larger than Fra Angel ico's great altarpiece for the high altar of the same church.19 It was commissioned before Savonarola's official assumption of authority in San Marco, and includes no elements that require a Savonarolan connection. Most importantly, for the purposes of this paper, the painting includes a compelling vision of heaven, though one that seems to have few if any points of connection with the place imagined by Savonarola. In his description of his mystical ascent to the Virgin's pres ence, Savonarola insists, in allegorical language, that his expe rience of heaven depended on faith, prayer, and on simplicity, but that he had shunned rhetoric and philosophy.20 Savonarola does not specify the particular objectionable representations of or modes of access to heaven that he had in mind. The idea of ascent to heaven was a matter of lively concern in the decade and a half before Savonarola's vision, or journey. Saint Paul's reference in the second letter to the Corinthians to an ascent to 'the third heaven', or at least to its threshold21, was an especially important but not unambiguous text, occasioning much later dis cussion; in particular Paul also mentions ascent to 'paradise', and it is not clear if this is the same or a different event, or if the same locality is in question 22 In any case, the apostle ascribes the ex perience of being raptus usque ad tertium caelum to someone else, identified as 'a man in Christ', though most commentators identify Paul himself as the protagonist. Paul is not sure, moreo ver, whether the ascent to heaven happened 'in the body or out side the body', i.e. physically or as a mere vision (this phrase may simply indicate that Paul was 'beside himself, i.e. in a state of ecstasy in which the body was forgotten).23 The Pauline text was the subject of a treatise of Marsilio Ficino, De raptu Pauli {II rapimento di Paolo), published in 1478 24 In a departure from his usual practice, Ficino issued the treatise in an Italian as well as a Latin version, a decision that implies at least the expectation of a relatively broad reception for the treatise. Certainly Ficino was active as a preacher in those years, and from 1487 (when he was created canon of the cathedral, giving him a wider audience) his sermons included discussions of the letters of Saint Paul, on which he was preparing a further publication.25 There was perhaps, however, a more immediate implicit tar get of Savonarola's disapproval. It is surely probable that the friar was thinking of Dante's Paradiso, a poetic account of an ascent to the highest heaven and to the Blessed Virgin Herself that is marked, as is all the Divine Comedy, by a commingling of ideas and imagery from disparate sources, many of which are conspicuously non-scriptural 26 In some respects, indeed, Dante's account of heaven conflicted with accepted theological authority, e.g. that of Saint Thomas Aquinas, whose authority Savonarola, as a leading Dominican (in a reform convent), would have found impossible to ignore.27 Dante's position in Florentine culture had received quasi-official recognition through the publi cation in 1481 of a landmark edition of the Divine Comedy. This was the work of Cristoforo Landino, a scholar whose relations with Lorenzo il Magnifico had been especially close.28 Botticelli provided designs for woodcut illustrations, though the incidence of woodcuts varies from volume to volume, and perhaps only volumes printed later than 1481 contained any.29 12</page><page sequence="5">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 2.

Cim. 33. Photo: Philipp Allard, bpk, Berlin/Art Resource, NY Long after 1481, Botticelli continued to work on a graphic correlate to Dante's poem [Fig. 2]; this remained incomplete, though 93 folios, covering most of the poem, are extant. There is evidence that this remarkably ambitious project was commis sioned, or perhaps merely supported, by Lorenzo di Pierfranc esco de' Medici, also the probable patron, or at least owner, of Botticelli's Primavera and the Pallas and the Centaur, which were certainly displayed in his palace.30 Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's political star rose markedly, if temporarily, in 1494 when he took the side of the republican opponents of the regime of the senior branch of the Medici family; his position prior to Lorenzo il Mag nifico's death in 1492 is harder to determine.31 Whatever his relationship with Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco, however, there is no doubt of Botticelli's personal commitment to what was, effectively, a visual commentary on the Comedy, suggesting that Vasari's reference to a 'commentary' composed by Botticelli was essentially correct, even if it was not in the me dium of text.32 In any case, when Vasari described Botticelli's career in his biography of the artist, he gave particular empha sis to the Dante illustrations, asserting — quite incorrectly - that the artist's obsessive concern with the Dante project had de railed his career and left him impoverished.33 Beyond his obvi ous factual inaccuracies, Vasari may at least have passed on, no doubt in exaggerated form, a commonplace association of Botticelli with Dante, whose status as the poet of Florence had been sanctified not only by Landino's great edition, but also by the famous fresco in the cathedral, commissioned in 1466, of Dante standing beside his imagined topographies as well as the 13</page><page sequence="6">Charles Burroughs 3.

In 1472 the Sala dei Gigli, a great reception room, was created in the Palazzo della Signoria, and already lavish decoration was doubtless planned, or at least foreseen. The few executed el ements include the room's beautiful double door with intarsia portraits of Dante and Petrarch [Fig. 3] 38 It was in the Sala dei Gigli that, on 30 August 1481, Cristoforo Landino's edition of the Divine Comedy was presented to the city's officials; this was the occasion for Landino's famous oration on Dante, delivered presumably next to the portrait of the poet, as Nicolai Rubinstein has suggested.39 Perhaps significantly, the design for the Dante portrait had been assigned to Botticelli (the portrait of Petrarch was based on a design by Filippino Lippi). Not long afterwards, in the San Barnaba altarpiece of c. 1487, Botticelli inserted a fic tive inscription in a tablet on the throne of the Virgin. In his usual role as intermediary John the Baptist draws the viewer's atten tion to what would surely be expected to be a scriptural text, but is in fact - extraordinarily - a quotation from Dante.40 Though the connections between Botticelli's drawings for Paradiso and the vision of heaven he created for San Marco are, as we will see, somewhat thin, the mere association of Bot ticelli with Dante, as interpreter or illustrator, may have been enough for Savonarola to include Botticelli's altarpiece among the 'rhetorical' and 'philosophical' images of Heaven that he found problematical. Unlike one of his brothers, Botticelli himself did not become an adherent of the friar's party, at least during Savonarola's lifetime41, though he would later produce paintings that might be concisely designated as 'Savonarolan', some of striking plainness.42 The contrast with the conceptually dense and artistically elaborate San Marco altarpiece could hardly be greater. Finally, as Dombrowski notes, in view of the friar's dif ficult relations with the papacy, the tiara, evoking the pope, on the head of God the Father in the coronation scene would hardly have been congenial to Savonarola.43 Image and Veneration In Botticelli's painting, heaven is the setting for the coronation of the Virgin, carried out not as usual by Christ, but rather by God the Father, apparently emphasizing her status as Queen of Heav en rather than Mother of God. There was certainly precedent for this arrangement, though never on so monumental a scale.44 As has been suggested, the painting may therefore at very least evoke, and have been intended to evoke, a key religious issue of the time, the immaculacy of the Virgin, i.e. her exemption from Original Sin.45 This was a doctrine subject to impassioned de bate, with the two major mendicant or preaching orders arrayed on opposite sides, the Franciscans in favor and the Dominicans on the whole vehemently against. Lorenzo de' Medici's great adversary Pope Sixtus IV, a member of the Franciscan order, had moved toward ratification of the doctrine by approving, follow ing a debate in Rome in 1477, the celebration of the Virgin's conception (a Florentine visual example of Franciscan devotion to the Immaculacy is the altarpiece, painted by Piero di Cosimo in the Franciscan church in Fiesole and now dated to c. 1515, of the Virgin with God the Father, who is shown proclaiming her exclusion from the law to which all others are subject).46 In 1485, however, those intent on pursuing the debate about the Virgin's immaculacy were threatened with excommunication by Sixtus's successor Innocent VIII 47 The brothers of the Domini can convent of San Marco, in particular, for decades a center of strict obedience and orthodoxy, no doubt also complied with the order's official position on this issue, though the Dominican order allowed a degree of flexibility in the formulation of doctrine, which should be ratified by consensus.48 As for Savonarola him self, as Weinstein notes, he 'retained a certain ambiguity about the doctrine [of immaculacy]'.49 If he chose not to fall in with the prevailing, even official view of his order, it was perhaps not only for theological and doctrinal reasons, but also in recogni tion of the deep reverence for the Virgin among the Florentine populace, whose favor and support he was seeking to win over. Such devotion was surely shared by the immediate audi ence of the painting. The altarpiece was made for the chapel of the goldsmiths' confraternity, which was housed in the convent church (there is now no trace in the church itself of the chapel).50 The guildsmen were not necessarily sympathetic to Savonaro la's agendas, and in any case may have maintained a degree of independence from the convent within whose church they met to pray, if so, they were not alone; we know of at least one other group whose place of communal worship was within the con vent but who maintained independence from the order that ef fectively only functioned as their landlord.51 And in 1480, a mere decade before the goldsmiths' commission, a further confrater nity provided an altarpiece for a chapel within San Marco, but without including in the image any references to the order or the church's patron saints.52 This was true also of the goldsmiths' altarpiece. It is difficult to assess the significance of the absence from the goldsmiths' altarpiece of both the founder saint of the order, Saint Dominic, and the patron saint of the church and convent, 15</page><page sequence="8">Charles Burroughs Saint Mark.53 By no means however does it constitute conclu sive evidence tor cool relations between the friars and the guilds men; indeed, a major concern of the guildsmen was surely that of projecting their own civic importance and affluence as well as their corporate piety through an unusually large and expensive work of art in a religious institution of some renown.54 Neverthe less, the fact remains that the altarpiece, as it exists, shows no elements that connect it to its site in a Dominican convent, still less to San Marco itself. Its address is very strongly to the imme diate congregation, the goldsmiths, and to their holy protectors. In a modest way it perhaps belonged to a class of sacred im ages soon excoriated by Savonarola, who famously inveighed against patrons whose chapel commissions were carried out 'for your honor, rather than the honor of God'.55 Still, the friar may have approved the lack of reference to the Medici, whose patronage of the convent, built and outfitted with Medici funding, is famously celebrated in Fra Angelico's altarpiece for the high altar of the convent church, in which the group of saints includes Saint Mark and Saint Dominic, as well as the house saints of the Medici, Saints Cosmas and Damian.56 Sign and Gesture in Sacred Painting From a semiological point of view, altarpieces of the later Quat trocento have a double character. The rapid evolution of figural representation had made the human body both a favored sign and a vehicle of communication. As a sign, a figure needed to be recognizable, often by becoming a composite sign through the addition of an attribute or identifying feature; in a sacred paint ing this was typically the instrument of a saint's martyrdom. Al tarpieces generally include a number of saints variously clutch ing or carrying their attributes; a challenge for painters, then, was the inherently static character of such figures, as well as the frequent oddness of groupings of men and women of differ ent periods, historical roles, and roads to sanctity. Accordingly, the so-called sacra conversazione developed, albeit slowly, with figures depicted as interacting with or at least acknowledging each other, whether through glance, gesture, pose, or even the evocation of speech.57 In short, the saint-as-sign was amplified and activated, and the increasingly interactive grouping of saints came to illustrate the unity and concord ascribed to the saints in paradise.58 In the fifteenth century, moreover, the theme became assimilated in the work of some artists to the model of dramatic visual representation made explicit by Leon Battista Alberti, in his treatise On Painting of 1435/36, through the famous notion of the istoria.59 Such a convergence of the sacra conversazione and the is toria is on the whole lacking in the work of Botticelli, who tended to maintain the distinction of people and stories seen by Charles Hope as fundamental in the Renaissance approach to sacred painting.60 Indeed, though Botticelli certainly knew Alberti's treatise on painting, he was largely resistant to the ideas and methods articulated in it, as Dombrowski has emphasized.61 Nevertheless, Botticelli introduced into his sacred paintings a device endorsed by Alberti as part of an istoria, the insertion of a figure, the ammonitore, who seems to mediate between the pictorial field and the viewer's space by means of ostension, i.e. pointing.62 As noted above, in religious art Saint John the Baptist often takes this role, especially in paintings made in Florence, whose patron saint he was63; the Baptistery, his primary shrine in the city, claimed among its relics Saint John's finger (presum ably the index finger, the finger with which he indicated), which was inserted into a precious reliquary in the later fifteenth centu ry.64 As the pointing saint - a saint as sign, signing - the Baptist is in general the mediator not only in sacred images, but also in hagiography, as the herald of Christ.65 John's liminal status is of course a striking feature of many Renaissance altarpieces. A major example is Botticelli's altar piece for the Bardi chapel in Santo Spirito, documented as ex ecuted in 1485 [Fig. 4] 66 This is a remarkably rich and complex image carrying elaborate scriptural references, in part through text carried on scrolls, in part through a symbol-rich vegetative setting taking the architectural form of niches framing the three figures. Botticelli uses relatively understated gesture to bring vi vacity, even drama, to the composition which sets the central group of the Madonna and Child between the two Saint Johns, whose contrasted pose and attitude point the way toward the San Marco altarpiece, while embodying the familiar Renais sance opposition between the active and contemplative life.67 No longer the beautiful young man whom Jesus loved, the Evan gelist is shown as a still handsome older man, with beard and white curly hair cascading to his shoulder. In his right hand he elegantly holds his quill, and he looks out into space as if seek ing inspiration, grasping in his left hand the unidentified book on which he is engaged. The Baptist's gaunt appearance is in sharp contrast to the lavish greenery and flowers behind him; he gestures toward the Child and turns his fervid glance toward the viewer, appearing as the passionate and compelling preacher mentioned in scripture. In the San Marco altarpiece, on the other hand, the Baptist does not appear, instead, the intercessory role is given to other figures. The lower portion of the painting is taken up by four monumental and markedly differentiated figures of saints, who are related to each other in formal terms but do not in any sense 'converse'. To the right stands the patron saint of goldsmiths, Saint Eligius, known in Tuscany as Alo. Costumed as a bishop, Eligius raises his right hand as he gives the benediction to a vir tual congregation; in other words, he takes the role of ammoni tore with respect to the viewers in the chapel. Like the Baptist in the Bardi altarpiece, he is contrasted with the Evangelist, who is here an equally intense but more active figure, raising an open 16</page><page sequence="9">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 4.

Eligius gestures toward the space of the viewer, suggesting his closeness to the users of the chapel in terms of his shared association with artisanal craft and with the handling and transformation of materials that were often not only valuable but also powerfully talismanic.69 This aspect of certain materials, and its implications for goldsmiths' activity, was a matter of particular concern - not least, surely, to those working in gold and precious stones - at the time of the com mission for the San Marco altarpiece. Ficino's extremely popular and influential treatise Three Books on Life (De vita iibri tres) had just been published70; the third book of the De vita carries the title On Obtaining Life from the Heavens (De vita coeiitus com paranda) and an important theme is the hidden powers (proprie tates occuitae) within objects and images.71 Ficino's book im mediately provoked an outcry, to which Savonarola contributed with a vehement invective against astrology in sermons of 1493 and later, and Ficino himself thought it best to produce a defen sive Apologia.72 Representing Heaven, After a Fashion If Eligius relates to the professional and devotional world of the guildsmen, and to the materials manipulated by goldsmiths, the Evangelist gestures toward the representation of heaven, to the act of coronation itself, which occupies the upper field. His ges ture points to a world of abstraction, powerfully symbolized by the blank page of his book, which perhaps echoes the aniconic gold ground of the upper register. As Dombrowski points out, the San Marco altarpiece exemplifies a format - vertical rectan gle with rounded top - that had come to prominence only in the previous decade. The pictorial field is divided into contrasting zones, with a lower rectangular zone surmounted by an upper zone with an arched top that Botticelli exploits to set off the im age of the coronation of the Virgin. This was a theme that gen erally required the representation both of heavenly and earthly zones, though there is no earlier painting in which this dichoto my is so emphatically made.73 Here, the disparate fields are con trasted also through distinct representational conventions and, to a degree, materials, which give particular emphasis to the im age of heaven in the upper part of the painting. Following her bodily assumption into heaven after her physical death, Mary receives her crown as Queen of Heaven. More usually it is Christ who crowns his mother; here however the aged, white-bearded figure of God the Father takes this role. Of course no scriptural justification existed for either version, but there was recent visual precedent for Botticelli's representation of the coronation.74 This perhaps deepened the contrast between earthly and heavenly zones, while emphasizing the special character of the Virgin's ascent from the one to the other. Heaven itself is defined and demarcated in two contrasting ways. First Botticelli uses a gold ground to indicate heaven; this is often understood as an archaic procedure by this time, reviv ing a practice of late medieval artists working in what Giorgio Vasari would later call 'the Greek style' (i.e. Byzantine).75 More significantly, it marks a further challenge to Albertian prescrip tions, or indeed to prevailing notions of artistic 'progress'.76 It may be relevant that the gilding of frames, i.e. the new style rec tangular frames marking off the image as 'window', was a fre quent practice77, and it may well have seemed that the place for such expensive and beautiful material was within the picture, rather than banished to its edge. In this altarpiece, Botticelli's use of gilding may mark a concession to the conservative pi ety of the convent where Savonarola was now prior.78 On the other hand, needless to say, the gilded ground happens to draw attention also to the patron, the goldsmiths' guild, and its re sources. But already in the Bardi altarpiece, the inset painting of the crucifix, with its black background, embodies a more hi eratic, less 'realistic' style of depiction than Botticelli uses for the rest of the painting; in other words, he institutes a contrast between older and newer representational protocols, as well as an implicit comparison in favor of the former.79 In the San Marco painting, Botticelli's apparent archaism in using a gilded ground seems to betray limited confidence in the 'representability' of heaven. In this matter, artistic choice echoed current concerns; as Dombrowski has noted, the old debate about the use of im ages in worship had flared up again, and was not only evident in the discussions of intellectuals but also in the practice of artists, not least Botticelli.80 The second device used by Botticelli to characterize heaven is the motif of circularity, reinforced by dancing angels. A literal circle, as well as the motif of dancing angels, recurs in many of the artist's drawings for Dante's Paradiso (in the San Marco altarpiece also, Dombrowski sees the gestures of the four saints as completing a circle).81 I am not here concerned with the is sue of the relationship between the altarpiece and the drawings for the Paradiso and the probable date of the latter. There is no compelling reason to reject Dombrowski's description of the so lution in the altarpiece as a 'preparation' for Botticelli's engage ment with Dante's Paradiso82; as we saw, the work on the draw ings may have continued up to the death in 1503 of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco, and Botticelli surely worked on the drawings in the order of the poem, even if some drawings he made along the way were more finished than others. Whatever progress he had 18</page><page sequence="11">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery made on the drawings at the time he painted the San Marco al tarpiece, however, Botticelli certainly knew the Paradiso by then, and may for example have noted Dante's account of the heaven of fire, the empyreum, beyond the other heavens. Rather than instituting a stark contrast between the gold ground of the rep resentation of heaven and adjoining painted areas, Botticelli sof tens the curving edge of the gilded zone with reddish paint. His purpose may have been simply a matter of artistic effect; on the other hand, the red edging may refer to Dante's cerchio d'igne (.Paradiso 28.25).83 If so, Dante lured Botticelli into dangerous territory, since the existence of the empyreum was denied by certain important theologians, including as eminent an authority as Thomas Aquinas.84 Botticelli's use of a gold ground has been described, as we saw, as archaic, as if he had been seeking to replicate the ef fect of a traditional Byzantine icon, in which the gold ground symbolizes, but certainly does not illusionistically represent, per fection and the light of heaven.85 For Dombrowski, in an article on Savonarola and the visual arts, the painter's concern was to evoke a world beyond the reach of empirical access, and to in dicate the relationship between the transcendent and the earth ly.86 But in his monograph on Botticelli's sacred paintings he goes further, suggesting that the use of gold is a key element or device in creating the experience of an architectural setting, an idea that is surely inconsistent with the aim of providing a view into transcendent space. Dombrowski makes a compelling case that, even though the San Marco altarpiece lacks any literally ar chitectural elements, it recalls - and would have recalled to con temporaries - the arrangement of an apse with a gold backed mosaic above a painted scene, thereby lending a sense of spatial expansion as well as impressiveness to the goldsmiths' chapel.87 The four massive saints would also appear as pillars of the church in a more than metaphorical sense.88 The gold smith's chapel itself was destroyed in the sixteenth century, but it is known to have been rectangular, with its rear wall formed by the inner front wall of the church; this would have been the surface experienced as an apse. The implications are fascinating: if Dombrowski is right, not only is Botticelli's representation of heaven in important respects anti-illusionistic, it is also presented as an image of an image, one decorating the surface of a fictive apse. Such a device raises questions about its effect, as well as the intentionality involved. As noted above, the work on the painting occurred in a period of the resumption of concerns and scruples about sacred im agery; such concerns were rooted in ancient controversies, of course, but were surely now sharpened by the effective triumph of 'Albertian' protocols of visual representation, especially the in sistence on a unified pictorial space achieved, typically, through the application of perspectival construction. In the San Marco altarpiece and other prominent works Botticelli challenged such a conception of pictorial representation, though certainly he was concerned to engage and emotionally involve the viewer, as if following, in this case, a recommendation made by Alberti. In his treatise On Painting, indeed, Alberti famously promotes a type of image able to 'move the soul' of the beholder; Botticelli, who knew the treatise and did not object to all of it, may have had such ideas in mind.89 We might see them as realized, for ex ample, in the strongly modeled and assertive figures inhabiting the lower section of the San Marco altarpiece, whose physicality and gestures connect the viewer with the heavenly scene. How ever, the device of an implied architecture surely counters this connection, acting instead to conjure a virtual world - a world of representation - beyond physical access, and to dramatize the resulting effect of distance. Devices designed to separate the viewer and the object of viewing are not uncommon in Renaissance visual culture, though scholars have always tended to emphasize the effect of continuity, through perspective, of virtual and real space across the Albertian window. Alberti's legacy, however, is not a simple matter. The passage in the Delia Pittura (1.19) in which Alberti in troduces the famous window metaphor is as much about sepa ration as merger, and suggests an approach to representation that is in principle akin to that apparently sought by Botticelli in the San Marco altarpiece, though no direct connection could be claimed. When Alberti outlines the idea of the perspective win dow, he employs a rhetoric of distance, i.e. between the subject and object of viewing; one sees not through the window, as the phrase is usually translated, but from it ('per donde la fenestra' or 'ex finestra' rather than 'per la fenestra' or per 'finestram').90 And in his discussion of the figure of the ammonitore, Alberti posits a literally menacing figure (On Painting 2.42), keeping the viewer at bay91: 'I like there to be someone in the istoria who tells the spectators what is going on, and either beckons them with his hand to look, or with ferocious expression and forbidding glance challenges them not to come near, as if he wished their business to be secret, or points to some danger or remarkable thing in the picture [...]'. In other words, Alberti outlines a voli tional dimension to the relationship of viewer and viewed, the nature of which is specified by the painter. Effectively Alberti invokes not one, therefore, but two win dow models. By suggesting interaction between the ammonitore and the viewer (thereby emphasizing an actual-to-virtual spatial continuum), a painter may confound the spatial separation oc casioned by the perspective window; alternatively s/he may draw attention to this, emphasizing the distancing function of the picture surface. In the latter case, it may be argued, Alberti's ammonitore still interacts with the viewer, but only in order to emphasize the latter's exclusion from the space of representa tion. Alberti does not develop the idea, nor does he give exam ples, but he notes the possibility that the ammonitore's gestures are contained within the pictorial field, no doubt as a device to bring about an effect of liveliness (an example of this might be 19</page><page sequence="12">Charles Burroughs the interaction typical of the emerging sacra conversazione ar rangement).92 I have found no discussion of the implications of Alberti's threatening ammonitore, or more generally of distanc ing effects in Renaissance art, though some possible particular cases have been explored, notably the introduction, decades before Botticelli's arrival, of intermediaries in images on the walls of some cells within the convent of San Marco itself.93 I shall return to the issue below. The Four Saints: Sermon, Book, and Vision John the Baptist, as we saw, is the ammonitore par excellence, not least because his gesture of indication has both symbolic and iconographical force, in that it alludes to his historical role, while serving also as an identifying attribute. In Florentine im ages, John's act of ostension addresses his flock, whose com munality derives from baptism in his shrine. In the San Marco altarpiece, of course, the Baptist's place is taken by Saint Eli gius, whose gesture of benediction connects the sacred event depicted in the image to a group whose communality was formed or at least performed in devotion to him, as patron of the guild. Because directed beyond the virtual space of the painting, moreover, Eligius's gesture marks him out from the other three saints who keep him company in the lower section of the paint ing, standing in a wide and rocky landscape and reacting in dif ferent ways to the celestial visions above. The obvious question concerning the selection of these saints was partly answered above; both Eligius and John the Evangelist were patrons of the goldsmiths, but here Botticelli contrasts them in terms both of their appearance and their postures, or even roles, in the group of saints. There is no place for the patron saint of the church, Saint Mark, or indeed the founder saint of the order, Saint Domi nic, or any other Dominican, who might in this context appear as a surrogate for the convent's prior, Savonarola 94 This cir cumstance suggests not only the ability of the goldsmiths to maintain relative independence from any agendas or concerns of the friars, as indicated above, but also their focus on issues and ideas of concern to them. As Dombrowski surmises, the goldsmiths must have been responsible for the selection of the figures in their altarpiece.95 The reason for the inclusion of the other two saints has been a subject of debate. In particular, attempts have been made to connect the group as a whole (excluding Eligius) to the doctrine of the Virgin's immaculacy, though the connections of, from the left, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Augustine, and Saint Jerome, to that doctrine are at best vague.96 What needs emphasis here, however, is the visual logic of the painting itself, or rather the altarpiece, including both the principal image, the coronation of the Virgin and the four saints beneath, but also the predella, the strip of minor images inserted beneath it. This cor responds to the usage of the time, as does the narrative aspect of the predelia scenes, contrasting with the more hieratic quality of the main image [Fig. 5].97 This predelia is untypical, however, in the care taken in its making; indeed, rather than being as signed to workshop personnel, it was surely executed by the master himself.98 The contrast between the two images of Saint Eligius, pa tron saint of the guild, is especially remarkable. In the altarpiece proper, Eligius holds a crozier, symbol of his office, in his left hand and gives the benediction with his right; he looks toward and addresses a virtual congregation positioned in the space of the viewer, the recipient of the blessing. Such a direct address to an audience on the part of a participant, e.g. in a court case or in a dramatic or visual representation, is known in rhetorical theory as apostrophe.99 But in this case, the mediation of Eligius as an ammonitore figure is not only an artistic device; it is also a matter of liturgy, a ritual act signaled by the elaborate crozier in the bishop's left hand. If it had ever existed, needless to say, this crozier would have been a remarkable achievement of the gold smiths' art, and may well have echoed actual liturgical objects provided by the goldsmiths to enhance worship in their chapel. It would have reinforced, in other words, the sense of Eligius's apostrophic gesture as reaching beyond the painting's edge, its literal frame, to the larger setting, not just in physical or architec tural terms, but as constituting what Richard Trexler called 'the social frame', where the interests and agendas of various social actors might intrude in various, sometimes messy, ways.100 In the predelia image, on the other hand, Eligius appears in a narra tive scene, as was customary in the genre. But this little painting shows a strikingly different dimension of the saint's activity, or rather being [Fig. 6]. We see Eiigius the metal worker within the production space of his craft: in a dark and smoky smithy, he labors at the anvil while flames rise from the furnace and a horse bucks as, miraculously, its severed leg is shoed, and the devil, in the shape of a beautiful young woman, looks on. The contrast be tween Eligius as protagonist of the predelia image and the monu mental figure above points to a temporal succession of roles, i.e. from artisan to bishop, even though, in hagiography, Eligius was active in his early career not so much as a 'mere' artisan but rath er as a kind of entrepreneur, overseeing the royal treasury, before rising to appointments in the Church, culminating as bishop.101 Beyond his skill as an artisan, therefore, Eligius was a model for the goldsmiths, and the reference to his professional ascent was perhaps a reminder that certain members of the Florentine guild had achieved political and economic prominence.102 To Eligius's right in the main painting appears Saint Jerome, another saint of marked contrasts; in the predelia he appears as the self-mortifying hermit, while in the main panel he is dressed in cardinal's vestments, and holds a book, a reference to his achievement and fame as biblical translator and commentator. At first the book seems to be closed; on close inspection, however, 20</page><page sequence="13">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 5.

Photo: Scala/Art Resource, NY it is evident that Jerome is holding a place in the book with his thumb. Apparently the vision of heaven has, for the moment, dis tracted him from his reading, perhaps a biblical passage allud ing to the status of the Virgin - or perhaps this is a reference to Jerome's reflections on the difference, as discussed by Georges Didi-Huberman103, between historia and tropology, surface and depth, a contrast embodied in the modalities of representation in the altarpiece, one operative in the area in which Jerome himself appears, and one in that on which he meditates. In any case, what is undeniable is the striking attention that Botticelli gives to the way Jerome holds his book, as well indeed as the general prominence of books in the lower register of the altarpiece, in which Jerome is one of three saints holding books, but in mark edly different ways. Such a differentiated emphasis on books (not just on writing) is remarkable in an altarpiece104; moreover, it is striking that in a version of the painting executed shortly after wards in Botticelli's workshop there are now no books at all!105 Jerome stands next to a saint with whom he is often paired, Saint Augustine, like Jerome a Father of the Church. As was cus tomary, Augustine wears the vestments and miter of a bishop; as such in this image he is paired with Eligius. Self-contained, Augustine holds an inkpot in his left hand and writes with his right hand in a book whose exterior, clad in red leather, is fully displayed. Augustine's pen is stationed on the top line of the left hand page, as if initiating a new text in response to the heavenly happenings. The corresponding predella image shows the saint 22</page><page sequence="15">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 8.

Photo: Scala/Art Resource, NY in his study, deep in thought at a largely empty desk, as if in res pite from the avalanche of books threatening to surge forth from the cupboard behind the saint's right shoulder [Fig. 7], Nothing could be more removed from the disciplined collection of books and instruments displayed on the shelf in Botticelli's earlier fres co in Ognissanti of the saint, though the latter, here too, seems to turn away from his reading to seek inspiration elsewhere.106 As for Saint Jerome, the altarpiece and predella together illus trate the two extremes of his hagiographical profile, as scholar and as desert-dwelling penitent hermit, even if in the predella the saint's scarlet cardinal's hat hangs conspicuously and incongru ously on a rock and a city is visible in the background [Fig. 8]. To Augustine's right, finally, stands the utterly contrasting figure of Saint John the Evangelist. In an ecstatic gesture he reaches his left arm and open palm toward heaven, indeed into the space of the dancing angels; it is perhaps relevant that, ac cording to a persistent hagiographical tradition, he is carried bodily to heaven at death.107 He also carries a book, which he holds open toward the viewer; the book itself, not the man, is the apostrophic agent here. The book is empty, as if available for the heavenly vision to imprint itself directly within it, without an intermediary, perhaps in accordance with the idea, held by at least one fifteenth-century Dominican authority, that the Book of Revelation was written by God, with John merely serving as 23</page><page sequence="16">Charles Burroughs scribe.108 John's blank book appears to have no precedent in visual culture109, though it may echo the blank pages within Botticelli's Paradiso illustrations, and the probable textual oc casion and justification for these, the poet's remarks about the limits both of understanding and expression. Indeed, faced with the challenge of describing the fiery heaven or empyreum, the abode of the Trinity, Dante admits the necessity for a 'nova vista', a mystical vision entirely removed from physical perception and experience, and as such beyond visual representation.110 Bot ticelli was surely aware of this. There is however a striking con trast between the ecstatic Saint John of the main painting and the image of the saint presented in the predella as a busy scrib bler [Fig. 9]. Here, in isolation on the rocky island of Patmos, the saint bends to the task of writing the Book of Revelations, which we are told he wrote on Patmos, with its visionary account of the woman clothed in the sun, an important source for the argu ments for Mary's immaculacy. Dombrowski assumes the book held by John is Revela tions, though it is also possible that it is the Gospel; i.e. that the two sides of John's authorial activity are emphasized. In any case, the four saints cohere as a group, not through some puta tive theological explanation, but rather through their functions within the image.111 On a vertical axis, they exhibit resemblance, in terms of a relationship between hieratic figure and narrative agent. On a horizontal axis, they exhibit difference, in terms of their response to the transformation of heaven and the necessity of making a record of this that is adequate to the impact of the event (John), the necessity of proper interpretation (Augustine), consistency with scripture in general (Jerome), and the need for communication to the Christian faithful (Eligius). In short, the painting presents distinct modes of human mediation, from John as ecstatic intermediary to the transcendent realm to Eli gius's institutionalized and familiar enactment of communication to his congregation of fellow guildsmen. Conclusion The San Marco altarpiece demonstrates Botticelli's penchant for developing the differentiation or even opposition of contrasted figures - or rather on occasion, perhaps, personified ideas - into a structuring logic crucial to any interpretation of at least some of his major paintings. First, beyond the obvious contrast of upper and lower zones of the altarpiece proper, the whole altarpiece of fers a striking contrast between the monumental and solid figures of saints, in the principal field, and the predella images in which they appear busily occupied in various activities. The contrast be tween a more hieratic main image and narrative predella panels was quite traditional, but it is especially marked in this case.112 The key contrast, however, is that between the image of heaven and those who mediate, in very different ways, between image and viewer. In the end, Botticelli's painting is not a repre sentation of heaven accompanied by saints, but rather a visual meditation on representation itself in the face of subject mat ter that, as Dante recognized, is ultimately beyond representa tion. In his foundational account of the ascent of the man rap tus usque ad caelum tertium, indeed, Paul insists that anything experienced in such an ascent lies beyond representation, at least in speech; Paul's model for communication in this instance is entirely logocentric, but we can extrapolate a similar attitude to visual representation.113 Beside Paul's discussions, certain Platonist notions may lurk in the background; in the Republic and Timaeus, both well-known in cultivated Florentine circles, Plato refers to heaven itself as if it was already a representa tion, because 'painted' (i.e. with stars) by divine agency.114 Later authors, especially Dante, elaborated this idea.115 Whatever impulses were in play, however, Botticelli's vision of heaven is clearly in important respects artificial, a mere approximation to the ineffable, requiring the interpretation of special intermediar ies who can at least come closer to transcendent reality. There was some precedent for this separation of the viewer from the subject of representation, at least in principle, in some of Fra Angelico's images of meditation in the convent at San Marco, in which Dominican friars are represented within the image as meditating on, if not beholding, the sacred event in question [Fig. 10].116 With different means, Botticelli's suggestion of im age-carrying architecture reinforces this very effect. More than any other Botticelli scholar, Dombrowski has emphasized the artist's intellectual as well as creative capac ity, while making a general and, in my view, well-taken meth odological point about the limited role of patrons, typically a conservative bunch, in the elaboration of subjects at least for sacred images.117 Indeed, Dombrowski has made this point specifically about Savonarola in relation to the production of images.118 But though he may well be right about Girolamo Benivieni's influence on the creation of the San Marco altar piece, such insistence on the decisive presence of a human ist adviser is somewhat inconsistent with Dombrowski's own general position on thematic invention, especially that of Bot ticelli, while also drawing attention away from a crucial issue at stake in this extraordinary image. Just how men and women should access transcendence was an urgent question at the end of the fifteenth century, when Ficinian Neo-Platonism was just one of many available models, especially in connection with the mysticism promoted by Benivieni and others. As noted above, Dombrowski has drawn attention to the re-opening of the debate about sacred images in the later 1480s; this may well have prompted a cautious approach on the part of an art ist especially well connected to the circles where such con cerns were discussed.119 In his representation of heaven in the San Marco altarpiece Botticelli, as we saw, puts distance be tween the viewer and the transcendent image in at least two 24</page><page sequence="17">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 10.

Photo: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY ways, i.e. by deploying symbolic elements and exploiting an effect of distance.120 At the same time he also self-consciously reviews modalities of approach to transcendence that surely echo his own attempts to do justice to a text where a similar concern is evident. In his drawings for the Commedia, he fol lows Dante's own artistic lead by consistently inserting Dante (or rather 'Dante', the pilgrim in the poem), along with Vergil, between the viewer of the Commedia drawings and the vision of other worlds and of other figures who especially in the In ferno, are stuck, as Ulrich Rehm has pointed out, in a different dimension [Fig. 2].121 Recent research has focused attention on the topic of the image within an image, involving a striking degree of artistic reflexivity, in the visual culture of Dante's own time, especially in Florentine art.122 It must remain an open question whether this provided an impulse to Dante, or indeed to Botticelli. Botticelli's insistence on 'Dante' as both author of and char acter in the Commedia is in line with the artist's general em phasis on the artificiality of art, as Dombrowski especially has recognized.123 But Dombrowski also suggests that, in view of the close relationship of painters and goldsmiths, Eligius may be regarded as Botticelli's avatar within the image (Botticelli himself, according to Vasari, apprenticed as a goldsmith with a craftsman from whom he took his name124); Botticelli's own earlier insertion of his own image in an ammonitore role is well known.125 In this instance, then, Botticelli seems to have moved 26</page><page sequence="19">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery toward an approach to representation that Lars Jones has de fined as meta-picture, characterized by a disjunction between framing and framed image, modifying or even 'constructing' the beholder's experience126 (curiously he neglects the obvi ous literary parallels or even models).127 Jones provides vari ous examples of late-medieval or early Renaissance images that deploy this device - a depicted viewer of an image within an image — but does not mention an especially striking tradition of late medieval meta-pictorial representation, i.e. Apocalypse imagery, in which Saint John himself appears as viewer of his visions, that is as a primary viewer in relation to the secondary position assigned to the viewer of the manuscript or other work in question [Fig. 11],128 Such imagery tends to be northern, and I know of no evidence that Botticelli knew it, though certainly the theme of the Apocalypse was especially urgent in 1490, not least thanks to Savonarola's sermons (as I noted, Dombrowski suggests that the book held by Augustine is his commentary on Revelations).129 But the ambiguity of John's situation, respec tiveiy as visionary and author, between the transcendent and the earthly was a key aspect of his medieval status, as Jeffrey Hamburger has emphasized130; both aspects are evident in the San Marco altarpiece, even without the predella image. Accord ingly, if Botticelli's Eligius is the intermediary (whether or not he represents the artist) between the virtual world of the image and the social frame, John is the intermediary between the heavenly realm and that of human understanding and interpretation (at least on the part of those qualified to do so), or between pres ence and representation - if John takes the place of Dante's Vergil, in other words, then Eligius is 'Dante'. This set of spe cifically artistic (including poetic) concerns, though clearly not without larger implications, gets lost in the emphasis on puta tive Neoplatonist advisers. It is these concerns, however, that mark the San Marco altarpiece as one of the most remarkable and innovative images of a revolutionary era of image making, already responding to an atmosphere of gathering crisis and self-questioning. 1 D.

Jakobson, followed by Paul Ricoeur (The Rule of Metaphor: The Creation of Meaning in Language, New York, 2003, p. 172), uses the example of an image that, coincidentally, was well known in Renaissance Florence and associated with the Ru cellai family; 'in the emblem that the classical sail of a ship has become for us, we can read at once both' "This is a ship" and "Look: poetry!'".

Schneider, online edition, Leiden (accessed on 17 Sept. 2012 at &lt;http://www.paulyonline.brill.nl/ entries/brill-s-new-pauly/actio-e102860&gt;). 16 Though she deals with a later period, Jacqueline Lichtenstein (The Eloquence of Color: Rhetoric and Painting in the French Classical Age, Berkeley, 1993, esp. pp. 91-116), provides an excellent discussion of the issues. 17 On the idea of the relic-image, see A. Nagel, 'The Afterlife of the Reli quary', in Treasures of Heaven: Saints, Relics, and Devotion in Medieval Europe, ed. by M. Bagnoli etal., New Haven and London, 2010, pp. 214. 18 The literature on Botticelli is enormous, though the San Marco altar piece has only recently received due attention. In relation to this paint ing, as to all Botticelli's work, Damian Dombrowski has re-set the bar for Botticelli studies, especially as regards the sacred paintings. In many ways this article both draws on his discussions and seeks to go further, in a way focusing on what seem to me to be implications of his own arguments. See Dombrowski, Die religidsen Gemalde, pp. 306-324; idem, Botticelli: ein Florentiner Mater, pp. 105-111; F. Zollner, Botticelli, Munich, 2009, pp. 102-105; G. Vasari, Das Leben des Florentiner Mal ers Sandro Botticelli (1568), ed. by D. Dombrowski, in idem, Das Leben des Sandro Botticelli, Filippino Lippi, Cosimo Rosselli und Alesso Bai dovinetti, Berlin, 2010, pp. 9-34. Dombrowski draws on the fundamen tal researches of A. C. Blume, 'Botticelli's Family and Finances in the 1490s: Santa Maria Nuova and the San Marco Altarpiece', Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz, 38/1, 1994, pp. 154-164, and his dissertation: Studies in the Religious Paintings of Sandro Bot ticelli (Ph.D., Harvard University, 1995). In general, R. W. Lightbown, Sandro Botticelli: Life and Work, revised ed., New York, 1989, remains authoritative on the paintings. I have also extensively used U. Rehm, Botticelli - der Maler und die Medici: eine Biographie, Stuttgart, 2009. 19 As pointed out by Zollner, Botticelli, p. 103. 20 The Ladies Rhetoric and Philosophy approach him, but he spurns them; instead he chooses to go with Ladies Faith, Simplicity, Prayer, and Patience; Weinstein, Savonarola, p. 148; D. Chidester, Christianity: A Global History, New York, 2001, pp. 308. 21 II Corinthians, 12.1-6. The passage is discussed by Dombrowski, Die religidsen Gemalde, p. 255. The Vulgate text is as follows: '1. Si gloriari oportet (non expedit quidem), veniam autem ad visiones et revelationes Domini. 2. Scio hominem in Christo ante annos quatuordecim, sive in corpore nescio, sive extra corpus nescio, Deus scit, raptum hujusmodi usque ad tertium caelum. 3. Et scio hujusmodi hominem sive in cor pore, sive extra corpus nescio, Deus scit: 4. quoniam raptus est in pa radisum: et audivit arcana verba, quae non licet homini loqui. 5. Pro hujusmodi gloriabor: pro me autem nihil gloriabor nisi in infirmitatibus meis. 6. Nam etsi voluero gloriari, non ero insipiens: veritatem enim di cam: parco autem, ne quis me existimet supra id quod videt in me, aut aliquid audit ex me'. For the question of whether Paul was recounting one or two 'events' and whether he was actually talking about his own conversion, see J. Ashton, The Religion of Paul the Apostle, New Ha ven, 2000, pp. 42,118-120. Paul's scruples about a mystical or even shamanic journey - one that the apostle uses to bolster his credentials (charisma) with the Corinthian congregation - were apparently not sha red by Savonarola. Nevertheless, for the general influence of Paul on Savonarola, see Weinstein, Savonarola, pp. 349-399, nn. 14, 33 (Wein stein does not discuss II Corinthians). 28</page><page sequence="21">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 22 On the Renaissance 'geography of heaven', see McDannell and Lang, Heaven, pp. 121-124; the authors see Savonarola's vision as symp tomatic of a novel conception of heaven as a place within which the blessed may move or even 'float' between the garden paradise and the heavenly residence (Savonarola himself requires a ladder, ibid., p. 119). This fluidity does not jibe with Paul's separation of paradise and third heaven, though his language is perhaps ambiguous enough to allow a different interpretation. 23 B. Chilton, Rabbi Paul: An Intellectual Biography, New York, 2005, p. 115. Paul's state is compared to that of Christ himself when 'out of his mind' (Mark 3.21). 24 S. A. Gilson, Dante and Renaissance Florence, Cambridge and New York, 2005, p. 146, notes the analogies between Paul's ascent and that of Dante as pilgrim in Dante's Paradiso. 25 For Ficino's sermons at the Florentine duomo, see P Serracino-lnglott, 'Ficino the Priest', in Marsilio Ficino: His Theology, His Philosophy, His Legacy, ed. by M. J. B. Allen, V. Rees, and M. Davies, Leiden, 2002, p. 10. He was giving regular sermons at S. Maria degli Angeli from 1469, at earliest, into the 1490s; D. F. Lackner, 'The Camaldolese Academy: Ambrogio Traversari, Marsilio Ficino, and the Christian Platonic Tradi tion', ibid., pp. 31-33. 26 Savonarola knew the Divine Comedy: Weinstein, Savonarola, p. 151. 27 G.

Bianchi, Turnhout, 2011, pp. 25-36. 28 Cristoforo Landino (1425-1498) had been one of Lorenzo's teachers. In 1458, Medici support brought him the Chair of Rhetoric and Poetry at the Studio of Florence; R. Fubini, ad voc., Dizionario biografico degli Italiani, vol. 63, Rome, 1996, pp. 428-433. 29 On the early humanist ambivalence about Dante's language, in particular (condemned by some as 'plebeian'), as well as his critiques of Florence itself see Gilson, Dante and Renaissance Florence, p. 4; A. Mazzocco, Linguistic Theories in Dante and the Humanists: Studies of Language and Intellectual History in Late Medieval and Early Renaissance Italy, Lei den, 1993, p. 87; M. L. McLaughlin, 'Humanism and Italian Literature', in The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism, ed. by J. Kraye, Cambridge and New York, 1996, p. 230. Gilson (Dante and Renaissance Florence, pp. 163-193) also devotes a chapter to Landino's rehabilita tion of Dante the citizen in the prologue to his 1481 edition of the Divine Comedy. On the illustrations in Landino's volume, see R Keller, The En gravings in the 1481 Edition of the Divine Comedy', in Sandro Botticelli: The Drawings for Dante's Divine Comedy, ed. by H. Bredekamp and H.-Th. Schulze-Altcappenberg, London, 2000, pp. 326-333; P L. Rubin, Images and Identity in Fifteenth-Century Florence, New Haven, 2007, p. 339, with discussion of scholarly opinions. 30 The Anonimo Magliabechiano, writing c. 1542-1548, identifies the younger Lorenzo as commissioning the Dante illustrations (Rehm, Botticelli, pp. 198-199). Rehm suggests that the Commedia series re mained incomplete either as a result of the patron's political difficulties or his death in 1503. 31 Apart from the presence of the Primavera in Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's house, evidently a key site for the display of contemporary art (Lorenzo il Magnifico, on the other hand, focused on his collections of antiqui ties and all'antica objects), Horst Bredekamp (Botticelli: la Primavera, Modena, 1996, pp. 49-54) discovered internal evidence indicating the younger Lorenzo as patron of the Primavera. Bredekamp's bold and suggestive hypothesis that the Primavera should be understood in rela tion to the younger Lorenzo's active antipathy to the current regime seems to founder on the improbability of such an attitude already in the mid-1480s, when the painting was probably completed. 32 G. Vasari, 'Vita di Sandro Botticello Pittor Fiorentino', in Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori, ed. by G. Milanesi, vol. 4, Flor ence, 1878, p. 280: After returning from Rome, Botticelli 'se ne torno subitamente a Fiorenza.

Dante stayed in Ravenna, where he was buried following his death in that city. 38 Rubin, Images and Identity, p. 337. 39 N. Rubinstein, The Palazzo Vecchio, 1298-1532: Government, Architec ture, and Imagery in the Civic Palace of the Florentine Republic, Oxford, 1995, p. 61. The Dante portrait was all the more prominent on this oc casion as the fresco decoration had not yet been started; all that was achieved (the wall opposite the door) was executed by Domenico Ghir landaio in 1482-1484; J. K. Cadogan, Domenico Ghirlandaio: Artist and Artisan, New Haven and London, 2001, p. 226. On the close attention given by Lorenzo de' Medici to the project, see M. Hegarty, 'Laurentian Patronage in the Palazzo Vecchio: The Frescoes of the Sala dei Gigli', Art Bulletin, 75/2, 1996, pp. 264-285. 40 Dombrowski, Botticelli, p. 97; Rehm, Botticelli, p. 154. 41 Rehm (Botticelli, p. 218) notes that Simone Filipepi, an elder brother of Sandro, was closely associated with Savonarola from 1494, but that, among other evidence, Sandro did not have to flee Florence, as Si mone and other followers did, when the friar was executed in 1498. 42 R Joannides, 'Late Botticelli: Archaism and Ideology', Arte Cristiana, 83/768, 1995, pp. 163-178; V.

As Damian Dombrowski ('Savonarola und die heiligen Bilder - ein Problem der Botticelli-Forschung', Marburger Jahrbuch fur Kunstwis senschaft, 36, 2009, p. 78) points out, Savonarola paid no attention to the visual arts, except as a didactic instrument; he mentions contempo rary artworks only when he criticizes them as 'unseemly', etc. No doubt at least some of those involved in the shifts in taste at the end of the cen tury were thinking of the plain style within the threefold system of levels 29</page><page sequence="22">Charles Burroughs of speech of the ancient rhetoricians, as at Pseudo-Cicero, Rhetorica ad Herennium 4.11.

Polizzotto, 'The Medici and the Youth Confraternity of the Purifi cation of the Virgin, 1434-1506', in The Politics of Ritual Kinship: Con fraternities and Social Order in Early Modern Italy, ed. by N.

For Hans Korner (Sandro Botticelli, Cologne, 2006, p. 326), the altarpiece was markedly expen sive. However, Rehm (Botticelli, pp. 154-156) finds the price modest in view of the scale of work involved, and the effect poster-like; i.e. the guildsmen got what they paid for. It is relevant that the great humanist Poliziano, after ten years in the Chair of Poetics and Rhetoric in the Flor entine university, was paid just 200 florins a year! Ch. Celenza, Polizi ano's Lamia in Context, Cambridge, MA, 2010, p. 9. Schumacher (The Painter Sandro Botticelli'. An Introduction to his Oeuvre', in Botticelli: Likeness - Myth - Devotion, p. 48) notes that the painting cost as much as the Bardi altarpiece of 1485, which was especially elaborate, though of course lacking extensive gilding. 55 R.

For the type itself see B. Lindemann, 'An Unusual Sacra Conversazione by Giovanni Bellini', in Two Cultures: Essays in Honor of David Speiser, ed. by K. Williams, Basel and Boston, 2006, p. 166: 'The essence of the sacra conversazione consists of a general lack of thematic clarity: the community of saints are shown in a timeless context instead of as part of a narrative - and no indication is given as to the object of the figures' reflection'. As here, the large literature on the sacra conversazi one tends to focus on the Venetian tradition, in spite of the priority of Tuscan examples.

Like other guilds, the Silk Guild controlled a tabernac le at Orsanmichele with the image of its patron saint. The current statue of Saint John in the guild's niche is early sixteenth-century; the niche itself was constructed c. 1340, and a marble statue of the Evangelist was placed within it some time in the later Trecento; L.

On the other hand, he also (p. 312) calls attention to the way the feet of the dancing angels overlap the lower edge of the golden, i.e. heavenly, field. It may be relevant that, in these very years, Pico della Mirandola was articulating a famous at tack on divinatory astrology that posited a clear separation of earth and heaven, the 'natural' and the 'spiritual'; P O.

Rubin, Giorgio Vasari: Art and History, New Haven and London, 1995, p. 86; Woods, Making Renaissance Art, p. 15. 76 See for example, the reference to 'the archaic gold of heaven' in the discussion of this painting in G. Mandel, The Complete Paintings of Botticelli, New York, 1970, p. 7. Dombrowski (Die reiigiosen Gemalde, p. 315) stresses Botticelli's sophisticated use of gold, used to indicate bodiless ideas, intelligibilia. For the idea of a necessary correlation be tween the abandonment of gold and the adoption of new artistic pro tocols (also involving a shift from the ascription of value to material as opposed to artistic skill), see J. Dunkerton, ef a/., Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery, New Haven, 1991, p. 207: 'Attitudes towards gold are indeed often the most valuable index of the changing conception of the art of painting'.

Rehm (Botticelli, p. 152) notes evi dence that Botticelli gilded frames constructed for his paintings. 78 This is the view of Cecchi, Botticelli, p. 256. For the argument that pre cious materials as such continued to be highly valued in the Renais sance, especially in the Florence of Lorenzo il Magnifico, see M. Beloz erskaya, Luxury Arts of the Renaissance, Malibu, CA, 2005, p. 16. The triumph of skill was as yet far from complete, perhaps in part because of the 'magical' associations of such materials, as noted below. 79 Burroughs, 'The Altar and the City', p. 14. 80 Dombrowski, Die religidsen Gemalde, p. 253; idem, 'Savonarola und die heiligen Bilder', pp. 77-116. In the latter, Dombrowski sees the Bardi altarpiece of 1485 as already marked by Botticelli's response to the newly awoken debate about images in worship. 81 Dombrowski, Die religidsen Gemalde, p. 313. 82 Ibid, p. 59; 'dieses Vorgehen findet sich bereits in der Marienkronung aus dem Jahr 1490 vorbereitet'. 83 As pointed out by C.

In Latin: 'Principio in super ficie pingenda quam amplum libeat quadrangulum rectorum angulorum inscribo, quod quidem mihi pro aperta finestra est ex qua historia con tueatur, illicque quam magnos velim esse in pictura homines determine [...]' (italics mine). Grayson translates (On Painting, p. 54): 'I draw a rec tangle of whatever size I want, which I regard as an open window through which the subject to be painted is seen'. Rocco Sinisgalli translates the key phrase: 'it certainly functions for me as an open window through which the history is observed'. Alberti, On Painting, ed. Sinisgalli, p. 142. In private communication Rocco Sinisgalli has indicated that, in with re gard to 'per donde' and 'ex', meaning is context-bound. This is a reason able principle, but in this case, Alberti seems to me to tweak the context. 91 For the Italian text see n. 54 above. On the threatening ammonitore see Alberti, On Painting, ed. Sinisgalli, p. 192; 'there is someone who informs the spectators of the things that unfold, or invites with the hand, or threatens with severe face and turbid eye not to approach there, as if he wishes that a similar story remains secret; or indicates a danger [...]' ( E piacemi sia nella storia chi ammonisca e insegni a noi quello che ivi si facci, o chiami con la mano a vedere, o con viso cruccioso e con gli occhi turbati minacci che niuno verso loro vada, o dimostri qualche pericolo [...]'). 92 This seems to be the force of Alberti's idea that the ammonitore 'by his gestures invites you to laugh or weep with them', involving empathy rather than the effect of gestural or even linguistic communication; the passage follows a lengthy discussion of the importance of the repre sentation of emotional states. Alberti, On Painting, ed. Grayson, p. 77. Alberti goes on to state that: 'everything the people in the painting do among themselves or perform in relation to the spectators, must fit to gether to represent and explain the historia'. 93 D. C. Ahl, Fra Angelico, London and New York, 2008, p. 141; A. Terry, 'Criminal Vision in Early Modern Florence: Fra Angelico's Altarpiece for "II Tempio" and the Magdalenian Gaze', in Renaissance Theories of Vi sion, ed. by J. Hendrix and Ch. H. Carman, Farnham, 2010, pp. 45-62, esp. 53; 'In the dormitory frescoes, Dominican figures act as beholders of Biblical events, thus fostering an interplay between the participatory witnesses painted within the scenes and the self-conscious viewers standing before them'. This was 'to encourage the Observant Domini can viewers to identify with the saint represented in the act of witness ing'. See also W. Hood, Fra Angelico at San Marco, New Haven and London, 1993, p. 214, noting that the scenes in the cells are not 'illus trations of scripture', nor narratives, but depend rather on liturgy. Elina Gertsman reminds me of the expositor figure in late medieval drama as knowing intermediary between the action of stage and the spec tators; see The Narrator, the Expositor, and the Prompter in European Medieval Theater, ed. by Ph. Butterworth, Turnhout, 2007. This seems to be a northern practice, but cultivated Florentines would have known of the mediatory role of the prologue in Roman Comedy. For a good account of this, see A. Sharrock, Reading Roman Comedy: Poetics and Playfulness in Plautus and Terence, Cambridge and New York, 2009, pp. 73-78. 94 On the absence of Saint Mark and Saint Dominic, see Cecchi, Botticelli, p. 256. 95 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 310. 96 Ibid, p. 314. 97 Hope, 'Altarpieces and the Requirements of Patrons', p. 538. 98 On the 'exceptional quality' of the predella panels, see G. Fossi, Uffizi:Art, History, Collections, Florence, 2004, p. 284; Caneva, Botticelli, p. 102. 99 On apostrophe in Botticelli and Quattrocento visual culture in general, see Ch. Burroughs, Talking with Goddesses: Ovid's Fasti and Botti celli's Primavera', 28, 2012, pp. 71-83. 100 R. C. Trexler, Public Life in Renaissance Florence, Ithaca, 1991, p. 21. 101 St Eligius ended his life as bishop of Rouen in seventh-century Gaul, dur ing the Merovingian period; his life story as related by his contemporary Dado is the basis of later accounts, Medieval Sourcebook: The Life of St. Eligius, ed. by J. A. McNamara (accessed online at: &lt;http://www.aug. edu/augusta/iconography/hagiographies/eligiusDado.html&gt; on 9 Sept. 2013). As a boy he was apprenticed to a goldsmith in Limoges who is introduced into the narrative as serving as chief budget officer (fiscalis monetae) of his city. Eligius came to royal attention through his skill as a goldsmith, after successfully fulfilling a commission to make a splendid throne. He quickly assembled a large shop, in which scriptural reading accompanied the practice of the craft, and had the capacity to construct shrines for the two patron saints of Merovingian Gaul, Saints Martin and Denis, the latter in Paris. Dado's account does not include the apocryphal story of the horse whose amputated leg was shod. 102 The guild member in charge of the commission, Carlo Gondi, belonged to the family that was building an impressive palace a short distance from the Palazzo della Signoria; Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 307. 103 G. Didi-Huberman, Fra Angelico: Dissemblance and Figuration, Chi cago, 1995, p. 39. 104 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 310, notes that the book held by Augustine closely resembles that of the Evangelist, and he identifies it as Augustine's commentary on John's Book of Revelations', otherwise he does not comment on this aspect of the painting. In fact, in some earlier altarpieces Botticelli privileges the action of writing, at least on the part of the Virgin; S. Schibanoff, 'Botticelli's Madonna del Magnifi cat: Constructing the Woman Writer in Early Humanist Italy', PMLA, 109/2, 1994, pp. 190-206. 105 Korner, Sandro Botticelli, pp. 328-329 (without reference to the change in attributes). This later version was made for the church of S. Fran cesco in the village of Montevarchi not far from Florence. Nor do books appear in the Coronation of the Virgin, c. 1510, now in the museum of Villa La Quiete near Florence, which was apparently produced in Botti celli's shop toward the end of his life; M. Branca, 'Piccoli Grandi Musei', in Comunicato stampa numero 5: Capolavori botticelliani e tesori prezi osi, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze, 2012: &lt;http://www.entecarifirenze. it/cont 133_456.phtml&gt;. 106 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, pp. 150-155, has an extensive and compelling analysis of the fresco, emphasizing that Augustine looks toward a transcendent source of wisdom. In the San Marco pre della, on the other hand, the saint appears more intent on inner-directed concentration, as if engaged in composing the Confessions rather than any other of his works. 107 On the medieval tradition, see J. F. Hamburger, St. John the Divine: The Deified Evangelist in Medieval Art and Theology, Berkeley, 2002, pp. 147-155. In Florence, Giotto's fresco of the scene in the Peruzzi Chapel in S. Croce was probably well known (ibid., p. 157). A Renaissance example in Florence is the image of Saint John's apotheosis in the Old Sacristy of c. 1431, by Donatello; Paoletti and Radke, Art in Renais sance Italy, p. 254. 32</page><page sequence="25">Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's Coronation of the Virgin and Mediated Imagery 108 The idea that the Apocalypse was 'the only book of the Bible of which Christ was the author, with Saint John merely acting as the scribe', is well attested in the fifteenth century, e.g. in the commentary of Fed erigo de Rinaldo, usually known as Federigo da Venezia (c. 1350-after 1401), a Dominican who matriculated as a doctor of theology at Bologna c. 1380, was active at Padua and Bologna as prior and professor, and finally was elected 'Priore della provincia di Lombardia inferior' in 1401. There are several extant manuscripts and a printed edition (c. 1469) of ten identified as by Nicolas de Lyra, whose writings on the Apocalypse were far more widely known. See J. Gunther, Rare Books Catalogue 10: Pagina Sacra, Stalden, 2011, no.16 (accessed online at: &lt;http://www. guenther-rarebooks.com/en/catalogues_publications/Catalogue_online/ Catalogue_10/16_DaVenezia_Apocalypse_1420.php&gt; on 9 Sept. 2013). 109 The great late fourteenth-century 'Mint Coronation' (Florence, Acca demia), a painting of the Coronation of the Virgin with saints document ed as commissioned for the residence of the Master of the Mint within the Palazzo della Zecca, includes two saints, John the Evangelist and Matthew, holding open books. Both show text which appears to be leg ible at a close view, like the text on the banners held by prophets in the spandrels of the frame. See Money and Beauty, ed. by L. Sebregondi and T. Parks, Florence, 2011, pp.135-136. In Filippo Lippi's Coronation of the 1440s (Uffizi), no books are apparent. In the decade or so before Botticelli's painting, Domenico Ghirlandaio produced various versions, in which books appear without emphasis or not at all. In the workshop painting The Coronation of the Virgin with Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, Denver Art Museum (c. 1478-1479), John appears in a pendant position to the Baptist and is shown reading from a book, of which only the cover is visible to the viewer; Cadogan, Do menico Ghirlandaio, p. 249 no. 27. 110 Klettke, 'Paradiesmystik im Grenzbereich des Nicht-Darstellbaren: Pa radiso XXX', p. 63. 111 For the non-binding nature of contracts for altarpieces, evidently leav ing the artist latitude to initiate changes, see M. O'Malley, 'Subject Mat ters, Contracts, Designs and the Exchange of Ideas between Painters and Clients in Renaissance Italy', in Artistic Exchange and Cultural Translation in the Italian Renaissance City, ed. by S. J. Campbell and S. J. Milner, Cambridge and New York, 2004, p. 34. 112 According to Hope, 'Altarpieces and the Requirements of Patrons', p. 538, in Renaissance contracts it was normal practice to designate the subjects of primary panels as figures, but those of predella panels as storie. 113 II Corinthians 12.4: 'quoniam raptus est in paradisum: et audivit arcana verba, quae non licet homini loqui'. 114 Plato, Republic 7.529 c-d; the stars are 'sparks that paint the sky [...] decorations on a visible surface'; cf. Timaeus 40a: 'a veritable ornament cunningly traced over the whole'. For these and related passages see J. Ahern, 'Dante's Last Word: The Comedy as a liber coelestis', Dante Studies 102, 1984, pp. 1-14, esp. 4. 115 Ahern, as in previous note. 116 See above and n. 85. 117 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 240: 'Botticelli and the Con struction of the Spirit: The Dante Drawings and the Limitations of Cul tural History', in Sandro Botticelli. The Drawings for Dante's Divine Com edy, ed. H.-T. Schulze Altcappenberg and H. Bredekamp, London and New York, 2000, pp. 298-305 and 346. 118 Dombrowski, 'Savonarola und die heiligen Bilder', p. 99, makes this point in a discussion of the painting usually considered Botticelli's most Savonarolan work, the London Mystical Nativity, which in his view de parts from Savonarola's concern with immediate legibility and emotion al effect. 119 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 254, emphasizes the role of Pico della Mirandola, whose skepticism toward image worship he sees as nothing sudden, but rather arising out of a larger cultural milieu, in which Platonist ideas were especially important. 120 The idea of distance in this sense is taken up by Ricoeur, Rule of Meta phor, p. 172, though with a focus, unnecessarily, on contemporary lit erature: The metaphor of the interior space of discourse, then, must be treated like any other figure. It denotes the distance between the letter and virtual meaning [...]. What seems to me to be gained is the idea of an opacity of discourse centered on itself, the idea that figures render discourse visible'. 121 Rehm, Botticelli, p. 200; 'Durch die stetige Wiederholung der prota gonisten Dante und Vergil wird verdeutlicht, dass sie einer anderen Zeitdimension angehoren als diejenigen, denen sie in der Holle und im Lauterungsberg begegnen. Ihre Zeit ist die irdische, die es ihnen erlaubt, sich kontinuierlich in den verschiedenen Jenseitsregionen fort zubewegen, wahrend die Seelen der Verstorbenen auf Dauer an ihren jeweiligen Stationen verharren'. 122 R Bokody, Pictorial and Iconographic Reflexivity: Images-within-lmages in Italian Painting (1278-1348), PhD dissertation, CEU, Budapest, 2010. On the idea of an 'image representing an image', rather than some ob ject, see ibid., p. 8. In his very interesting text, Bokody does not discuss the depiction within a painting of an observer of an image within that painting. 123 Dombrowski, 'Savonarola und die heiligen Bilder', p. 97, refers to an 'immer scharfer hervortretende Bekenntnis [...] zur Kunstlichkeit der Kunst'. 124 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 309; Giorgio Vasari, Vita di San dra Botticelli, Florence, 1550: 'ne si contentava di scuola alcuna, di leg gere, di scrivere o di abbaco, di maniera che il padre infastidito di questo cervello sf stravagante, per disperato lo pose a lo orefice con un suo com pare chiamato Botticello, assai competente maestro allora in quella arte. Era in quella eta una dimestichezza grandissima e quasi che una conti nova pratica tra gli orefici et i pittori; per la quale Sandro, che era desta persona e si era volto tutto a 1 disegno, invaghitosi della pittura, si dispo se volgersi a quella', La biblioteca di Babele (online): &lt;http://bepi1949. altervista.org/vasari/vasari83.htm&gt; (accessed on 9 Sept. 2013). 125 Botticelli's presumed self-portrait, wearing a shockingly conspicuous yellow garment, in the Del Lama Adoration of the Magi of c. 1475 is one of the most notable cases of artists' participant self-portraits of the entire Renaissance. J. Woods-Marsden, Renaissance Self-Portraiture: The Visual Construction of Identity and the Social Status of the Artist, New Haven and London, 1998, pp. 48-50, emphasizes the apostrophic aspect: the image of Botticelli, 'posing alone in front of the crowd' de mands the worshipper's attention. See also L. Marin, 'Topic and Fig ures of Enunciation: It is Myself that I Paint', in Vision and Textuality, ed. by S. Melville and B. Readings, Durham, NC, 1995, p. 209. Botticelli's self-inclusion in the Del Lama painting is an example of the trope of deixis, i.e. use of language that involves a reference to the writing agent. According to Marin, Botticelli uses deixis to declare subtly his and his painting's claim to immortality. 33</page><page sequence="26">Charles Burroughs 126 Jones's starting point is Scenes from the Life of Saint Jerome by Francesco Botticini, in which paired saints to left and right adore what is presented as an image within the image of the penitent Jerome; L. R. Jones, 'Meditations on the Metapicture: Francesco Botticini's Saint Jerome in the National Gallery, London', in Coming About. A Festschrift for John Shearman, ed. by L. Ft. Jones and L. C. Matthew, Cambridge, MA, 2001, pp. 73-82; see also Burroughs, 'The Altar and the City', pp. 14-17. Jones (p. 75) suggests that 'the subject of [...] the panel seems to be neither St. Jerome nor even his image, but rather the acts of be holding and experiencing the image itself. This is a religious painting not only about religious painting but about the experience of religious painting'. This may be an exaggeration; after all, Botticini basically uses a traditional triptych format. Remarkably, Jones seems also unaware of the return of the debate about religious imagery at the time Botticini produced his altarpiece. 127 For the enduring impact of the framing device in Boccaccio's Decame ron in the fifteenth century, at least in literature, see L. Panizza, The Quattrocento', in The Cambridge History of Italian Literature, ed. by P. Brand and L. Fertile, Cambridge and New York, 1999, pp. 154-155. 128 M. Camille, Gothic Art: Glorious Visions, New York, 1996, pp. 18-19, notes the later medieval popularity, in manuscript as well as monu mental versions (notably the great tapestry displayed from 1480 in the cathedral of Angers), of the motif of St. John 'standing as spectator in each scene' so as to mediate visionary experience, 'sometimes look ing through a window onto the action but always registering an active response to what he is seeing'. See also R. K. Emerson, 'On the Thresh old of the Last Days: Negotiating Image and Word in the Apocalypse of Jean de Berry', in Thresholds of Medieval Visual Culture: Liminal Spaces, ed. by E. Gertsman and J. Stevenson, London, 2012, p. 16. 129 Dombrowski, Die religiosen Gemalde, p. 310, notes that the book held by Augustine is the same size and bound in the same material as that of the Evangelist, which he identifies as the Book of Revelations. 130 Hamburger, St John the Divine, pp. 185-186.</page></plain_text>
