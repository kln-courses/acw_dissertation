Despite the youth's apparent lack of interest, Salmacis follows him into the water, forcibly kissing and fondling him. When he rejects her advances, she asks the gods to join them forever. The result is a single creature of fused male and female body parts: As when one grafts a twig on some tree, he sees the branches grow one, and with common life come to maturity, so were these two bodies knit in close embrace: they were no longer two, nor such as to be called, one, woman, and one, man. They seemed neither, and yet both.2 SI acknowledge gratefully the Texas A&amp;M University Melbern G.

Late medieval vernacular poets, including Dante, Chaucer, Chreftien de Troyes, Guillaume de Lorris, Jean de Meun, Christine de Pizan, and Boccac- cio, among others, all made extensive use of Ovidian material in their writ- ings. The myth of the hermaphrodite, in particular, found a number of admirers and interpreters.3 Among the readers most fascinated with tales of transformation were alchemists, naturalists who explored the properties and composition of matter, as well as the possibility of manufacturing precious metals through human technology. Alchemists struggled to explain the material changes they believed metals underwent during the process of transmutation. Al- though alchemical writers offered a number of analogies, including plant- grafting and spontaneous generation, to characterize transmutation, such explanations were limited in their power to discuss alchemical change in terms of the sexed elemental qualities with which alchemists believed they worked.4 But such change was at the heart of Ovid's metamorphoses, and the hermaphrodite story provided a particularly apt model for alchemists: it described a fusion of male and female sexed parts into a biform body that was, as Ovid claimed, both and neither. It should come as no surprise that alchemists seized upon the image of the hermaphrodite to describe the "phi- losophers' stone," the chemical agent they thought transmuted base metals into silver and gold. According to alchemists, their work combined male and female elemental qualities into a compound substance of both sexes-a hermaphrodite-that was capable of transmutation. This body (since chem- icals and metals were often called "bodies" in alchemy) was both, but also neither, because the alchemical process held contrarieties in stasis, creating a new substance that was outside the norms of binary division. Of course, alchemy was not concerned with any actual case of intersex tenaci, / nec duo sunt et forma duplex, nec femina dici / nec puer ut possit, neutrumque et utrumque videntur." 3 Lauren Silberman, "Mythographic Transformations of Ovid's Hermaphrodite," Six- teenth Century Journal 19 (1988): 643-52; Marilynn R.

Alchemy borrowed ideas and vocabulary freely from medical and religious conversations, using familiar stories and images to explain sophisticated states of chemical change by analogy. As a result, alchemical texts are rife with medical images of human reproduction, reli- gious images of death and resurrection, and even hermaphrodites. Because the alchemical hermaphrodite was a symbol and not a person capable of illicit behaviors, it carried with it few of the negative connotations associ- ated with intersex humans, who were classified as "monsters" in moral and medical texts, and who were treated with equal parts curiosity and disapprobation. But the alchemical hermaphrodite depended upon under- standings of intersex people in medieval society, and it therefore shared in some of the transgressive elements of intersex, as I shall argue below. Even so, the composite nature of the hermaphrodite was elevated to an ideal in alchemical literature, leading authors to a startling conclusion. Alchemical texts played upon the metaphorical parallelism of the philosophers' stone and Jesus Christ to claim Christ him/herself as a hermaphrodite, the perfect combination of contraries-masculine and feminine, human and divine-in one body. Many historical studies of hermaphrodites have been published in re- cent years, chiefly because historians view societal attitudes towards inter- sex as especially revealing of contemporary ideas about sex and gender. Classic studies in the history of sexuality by John Boswell, Michel Foucault, and Thomas Laqueur have highlighted intersex as a part of their arguments that current understandings of sex and sexuality are neither natural nor inevitable.5 Building upon these studies, a number of new scholarly works have delved into medical, legal, and literary sources to explore the meanings of intersex in premodern and modern society.6 But hermaphrodites in al- I Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, 3 vols.

Jung and Mircea Eliade made im- portant contributions to the study of this subject, but they tended to view such images either as evidence of an unchanging psychological "collective unconscious" or as part of a cross-cultural mythological system.8 Yet histo- rians have more to learn from the specific cultural context of the alchemical hermaphrodite in premodern Europe; moreover, the alchemical hermaph- rodite can tell us something we may not be able to learn from other texts about the meanings of sex, difference, and change in alchemy and beyond. HERMAPHRODITES IN MEDIEVAL MEDICINE AND SOCIETY Hermaphrodites appear with regularity within discussions of sexual gener- ation and sex difference in medieval medical texts. As Joan Cadden has shown, the premodern medical world inherited two distinct and often con- tradictory theories of generation, the Hippocratic/Galenic model and the Aristotelian model, which led to divergent understandings of hermaphro- ditism.9 According to the older tradition, originated by the writers of the Greek Hippocratic corpus and popularized in the Middle Ages by the Pseudo-Galenic tract De spermate, hermaphrodites were neither male nor female, but an intermediary sex that combined male and female characteris- tics in equilibrium. During the normal process of conception and gestation, a number of factors-such as the child's position in the womb, or the rela- tive strength of the mother and father's sperm-determined the sex of an offspring, which might be male, female, or hermaphroditic.10 The compet- ing Aristotelian model, which derived chiefly from Aristotle's De generati- of Identity (New York: Routledge, 1990); Katharine Park and Lorraine J.

A hermaphrodite occurred when mat- ter contributed by the mother (in the form of menstrual blood) exceeded the amount needed to produce one fetus, but was not enough for two. The extra matter could form either conjoined twins or a single fetus with extra appendages, including a second set of genitals. Aristotle held, however, that the sex of a hermaphrodite was only superficially ambiguous: the true sex was determined by the complexion of the body (that is, the combination of heat, cold, dryness, and moisture within it), which always indicated either male (hot and dry) or female (cold and wet) sex. Medical discussions of hermaphrodites often figure in chapters devoted to "monsters" (usually meaning humans with birth defects), which authors attempted to explain according to the various theories of generation." A thirteenth-century medical tract, De secretis mulierum (attributed to Albert the Great, but likely written by one of his followers) places its analysis of hermaphrodites within a customary discussion of monstrous births. The author notes that while a hermaphrodite participates in both male and fe- male natures, he should always be called "male" simply because the male is the worthier sex.12 While the author views hermaphrodites as a combina- tion of masculine and feminine qualities, he nevertheless determines the hermaphrodite's sex according to the value of men and women within a binary gender system. Other authors discuss hermaphroditism in the con- text of not only monsters, but also sodomy or other forms of sexual devi- ance, or they attempt to fix the "true" sex of a hermaphrodite in terms of sexual activity and passivity. In his Summa de confessione, written about 1216, Peter of Poitiers cites hermaphrodites as a part of his polemic against masturbation, which Peter claims is more monstrous than sodomy, "since the person practicing it is both active and passive, and thus as if man and woman, and as if a hermaphrodite."'3 A similar association between her- " On monsters, see Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park, Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150-1750 (New York: Zone Books, 1998); David Williams, Deformed Dis- course: The Function of the Monster in Mediaeval Thought and Literature (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1996). 12 Pseudo-Albertus Magnus, Women's Secrets: A Translation of Pseudo-Albertus Mag- nus's De Secretis Mulierum With Commentaries, ed.

These medieval texts emphasize the problematic nature of individuals who do not fit easily into binary sex categories. Despite the continuum of sex difference proposed by the Hippocratic/Galenic model, Pseudo-Albert, Peter of Poitiers, and Peter the Chanter limited the transgressive potential of a hermaphrodite by establishing him/her firmly within either one of two genders-he/she cannot be neither or both in social contexts.'" As noted, hermaphroditism was also readily associated with sexual practices consid- ered deviant or undesirable, such as masturbation or sodomy. And because monstrous births were often thought to result from some secret sexual sin of the parents, hermaphrodites may have been doubly connected to sexual vice.'6 These examples suggest that hermaphrodites were a source of confu- sion and even suspicion to their contemporaries, necessitating their division into binary gender categories of male and female, and conveying the extent to which neitherness and bothness had the potential to threaten social and natural norms. SEXUAL LANGUAGE IN ALCHEMY Hermaphrodites had much more positive connotations in alchemy, which placed them within a larger discussion of the parallels between metal trans- mutation and sexual reproduction. Since metals had no obvious means to reproduce themselves, alchemists relied upon the metaphor of sexual repro- duction to explain their generation, as well as to theorize the philosophers' stone, the substance thought to transmute metals by hastening the natural processes of metal formation that normally occurred in the earth.'7 The 14 6"Non erit consortium viri ad virum, vel mulieris ad mulierem, sed tantum viri ad mulie- rem, et econtrario.

For instance, in his Epistola boni viri, John Dastin quotes from the Tabula sma- ragdina, as well as from the Arab alchemists Jabir and al-Razi, before con- cluding that "the stone is nothing other than the male and female, sun and moon, heat and cold, sulphur and mercury.""19 That is, the philosophers' stone is produced in a manner parallel to sexual reproduction among hu- mans, with hot sulphur taking on the sexual role of the male, and cold mercury, the female. The Tabula smaragdina was not the only alchemical text that required decoding. During the thirteenth century, European alchemists encountered Latin translations of Arabic writings, some of which included discussion of an unidentified alchemical base material, the "rebis."20 Latin alchemists such as Constantine of Pisa and Richardus Anglicus attempted to decipher the word, apparently a transliteration of a still-unknown Arabic term. Richardus interpreted "rebis" as an abbreviation for "res bina," or "two thing," which he identified with the philosophers' stone, and which many subsequent alchemists understood as a hermaphrodite.21 This attempt to solve the linguistic puzzle of the rebis was no isolated incident. Alchemists spent much of their time struggling to identify the meaning of cryptic al- chemical language and imagery in order to prove their worthiness among the company of adepts.22 But while alchemists could have interpreted a "two thing" in any number of ways, they generally solved the riddle of the 18 "Pater ejus est Sol, mater ejus Luna."

Even authors who did not explicitly use the word rebis began to describe the alchemical agent as a hermaphro- ditic substance. Scholastic thinkers Albert the Great (ca. 1193-1280) and Petrus Bonus of Ferrara (fl. ca. 1330) used sexual and reproductive analogies in their work, and they exemplify the early development of the idea of hermaphro- ditism in mineralogy and alchemy. Although Albert the Great's De mineral- ibus was not strictly an alchemical work, Albert drew from alchemical sources in order to supplement the Aristotelian natural philosophical cor- pus, which lacked an extensive analysis of minerals. Albert explained the formation of stones and metals by means of prolonged comparisons to sex- ual reproduction, which he rendered in language drawn from Aristotle's De generatione animalium. Moreover, he described sulphur (which he believed was simultaneously hot, cold, wet, and dry) as a hermaphroditic, plantlike substance.23 For Albert, a substance that contained all four qualities was in some sense both male and female, and thus capable of self-reproduction. Although Albert did not develop further the theme of the hermaphrodite, his understanding of hermaphroditism as a combination of unlike qualities within a substance was formative. Petrus Bonus of Ferrara seems to have been among the first to connect hermaphroditism explicitly to the alchemical agent of transmutation, a sub- stance that transformed metals into gold and silver upon contact. Unlike Albert's De mineralibus, Petrus' Pretiosa margarita novella was wholly concerned with alchemy and particularly with the philosophers' stone.24 Petrus described the philosophers' stone as a combination of sulphur and mercury, which he explained in terms of sexual reproduction: [They] call the milk that is coagulated the female, and the male that which coagulates, since activity is attributed to the male, and passivity to the female. For when this stone arises, since it is itself liquid and flowing and passive, it is called female. Its coagulum, that which coagulates it, when it is solid, firm, permanent, and active in it, is called male. The combination of these is called the compound stone, perfect and composite, and in the mixing they 23 Albertus Magnus, De mineralibus, ed. and trans.

Therefore the male and female are joined, and become one.25 The aftermath of this conjunction did not follow the same trajectory as human reproduction. According to both Galenic and Aristotelian models of conception, nearly all human pregnancies would result in an unambigu- ously male or female child; a hermaphroditic child would be born only in a rare case. At the end of a successful alchemical gestation, in contrast, a hermaphrodite is always the result. Petrus notes that when the process is complete, the philosophers' stone embodies both male and female complex- ionary qualities: And it must be known that the male and the female are the same and in the same substance, and they have diverse powers in such unity of subject ... [s]uch a union is able to be called Herma- phrodita: since plants and seeds impregnate wherever, and are also impregnated, and this denotes that activity and passivity in the same subject are mixed together into a certain unity. When, there- fore, the stone arises, it has in it a mixture of male and female.26 Since the stone is capable of both active and passive sexual functions, it is able to reproduce, much like a vegetable seed or an egg, and conse- quently to transmute metals. For Petrus, the alchemical hermaphrodite is a unity of contrary qualities. Although he may not have had Ovid's story in mind, Petrus' alchemical stone bears a strong resemblance to the mythologi- cal Hermaphroditus, who underwent a similar process to become a fusion of the sexes. Petrus' alchemical stone is a new chemical compound (neither the female nor male that existed before), yet he prefers to discuss it in terms 25 "[N]ominantes foeminam ipsum lac quod coagulatur, masculum autem quod coagulat: quia actio attribuitur masculo, passio vero foeminae.

As in the Ovidian story, the alchemical hermaphrodite is not merely a midpoint be- tween opposites, but a body that holds contraries in stasis and conversa- tion. While Petrus' comments suggest that he imagined the stone in terms of a hermaphroditic plant or egg, he also referred to the constituent parts of the substance as "woman," "king," or "wife," adding an anthropomorphic dimension to his analogy.27 The metaphor of biological reproduction was not the only image that Petrus used to characterize the philosophers' stone. He noted that the stone had a comprehensive nature that allowed it to be likened to multiple pairs of opposites, including "the corporeal and incorporeal . .. corruptible and incorruptible, visible and invisible, to spirit, soul, and body, and their union and separation," among other concepts.28 For Petrus, the stone was both nature and divinity, corruptibility and incorruptibility, and by extension, it was parallel to Christ. According to the scholar Chiara Crisciani, Petrus claimed that the stone bore all the chief aspects of Christ and his life: it was a union of divine and natural elements, the product of a miraculous birth, and subject to death and resurrection.29 Other alchemical treatises of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries drew similar parallels between Christ and the alchemical stone. In De lapide philosophorum, the author orga- nized his description of the alchemical operation with respect to the life of Christ, ending the work with a symbolic death and resurrection.30 The fourteenth-century alchemist John of Rupescissa explained the crucifixion of the philosophers' stone in his Liber lucis; after the "death" of the stone, it was to be entombed in the alchemist's equipment "just like Christ inside the sepulcher.""1 Analogies between the philosophers' stone and Christ 27 Ibid., II: 51.

Like Christ, the philosophers' stone was a combination of nature and divin- ity, of corporeality and incorporeality, of opposites united in one subject. The works of Albert the Great and Petrus Bonus reveal early stages in the development of the alchemical hermaphrodite. Both Albert and Petrus appear to have drawn from notions of the hermaphrodite as a fusion of male and female attributes, rather than from the understanding of the her- maphrodite as a result of doubling or superfluity. In addition, the alchemi- cal hermaphrodite was not a midpoint between opposites; instead, it was a unity of pre-existing and contrary parts that remained distinct. Petrus' text also reveals the multiplicity of analogies used to characterize the philoso- phers' stone: the stone was Christ, the stone was a king, and the stone was a hermaphrodite. These analogies were carried further in the works of other alchemical authors, who combined metaphors in new ways, exploring the interplay of balance and doubling in the image of the hermaphrodite and borrowing from a longstanding tradition of viewing Jesus as both male and female. THE JESUS HERMAPHRODITE By the turn of the fourteenth century, Latin alchemy was in the process of changing from a self-consciously scholastic discipline, wedded to the lan- guage of Aristotelian natural philosophy, to a field of study that was in- creasingly religious in its sentiments and vocabulary. The image of the hermaphrodite became crucial to these new writings, as can be seen from the text and manuscript illuminations of the undated Aurora consurgens and the early fifteenth-century Book of the Holy Trinity. While Albert the Great and Petrus Bonus tended to view the philosophers' stone as a her- maphroditic plant or egg, these texts clearly represented the philosophers' stone as a hermaphroditic human. While the precise date of the Aurora consurgens' composition remains uncertain, the earliest exemplar of the Aurora consurgens is a lushly illus- trated manuscript produced in the 1420s and now housed at the Zentral- bibliothek of Ztirich (Codex Rhenoviensis 172).32 The text of this 32 On this text, see Barbara Obrist, Les debuts de l'imagerie alchimique, XIVe-XVe siecles (Paris: Sycomore, 1982), 183-245; Barbara Newman, God and the Goddesses: Vision, Poetry, and Belief in the Middle Ages (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003), 235-40. 203</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS + APRIL 2008 anonymous treatise exemplifies the trend of religious language in alchemy, as well as the symbolic use of the alchemical hermaphrodite. The work draws from an array of Arab and Latin alchemical authors, as well as from sapiential theology of the biblical books of wisdom, to create a tapestry of biblical quotations and poetic imagery more akin to a mystical tract than a practical manual of alchemy. It opens with a paean to the female figure of Sapientia, or Wisdom, who is a "gift and sacrament of God and a divine thing, which most of all and in many ways has been hidden in figurative speech by the wise.""33 In the second section, Sapientia herself speaks in seven "parables" that ostensibly reveal the secrets of alchemy but are deliv- ered in highly metaphorical prose. The personified wisdom of biblical scrip- ture, which patristic and medieval authors identified variously with the female Virgin Mary or the male Christ, is equated here with personified alchemy-the lapis, or stone.34 The voice of alchemy in the Aurora con- surgens is thus chiefly female, but also sometimes male. In one passage, the feminine Sapientia describes herself in distinctly masculine terms: [To the one for] whose love I languish, in whose ardor I melt, in whose fragrance I live, by whose taste I regain my health, by whose milk I am nourished, in whose embrace I grow young, in whose kiss I receive the breath of life, in sleeping with whom my whole body is emptied of life, I will yet be as a father to him and he will be to me as a son.35 Sapientia here shows her/himself to be youthful and aged, revivified and drained, and united with a male who is both sexual partner and son (and who may be either the aspiring alchemist or the chemical sulphur, the "male" component of the alchemical stone). Alchemy is described by a se- 33 "Est namque donum et sacramentum Dei atque res divina, quae maxime et diversimode a sapientum sermonibus typicis est occultata." Aurora consurgens, ed.

More important, the usually feminine protagonist in the Aurora consurgens is transformed into a father, suggesting that Sapientia-and the alchemical stone-have both masculine and feminine aspects. A series of unusual illustrations accompany the text of the Aurora con- surgens and explore the theme of the alchemical hermaphrodite in new ways. While similar illuminations appear in at least seven manuscripts of the Aurora consurgens, the earliest extant copy-the Zentralbibliothek manuscript-is perhaps the most interesting.36 One particularly evocative painting from this manuscript envisions the alchemical stone as a hermaph- roditic youth in the clutches of a blue eagle (Fig. 1, p. 206). In this painting, the hermaphrodite is a physical fusion of male and female bodies, a biform person with two heads, two pairs of arms, two chests, and two sets of genitalia. The image draws upon the understanding of the stone as a combi- nation of sulphur (represented by its male half) and mercury (represented by its female half). As in the works of Albert the Great and Petrus Bonus, the hermaphrodite is a balance of male (hot and dry) and female (cold and moist) qualities, but its doubled heads and genitalia also invoke the Aristo- telian notion of the hermaphrodite as a superfluity of bodily matter. The shape of the body recalls similar images of conjoined twins, another "mon- ster" thought to be caused by excessive matter at the time of conception. The alchemical hermaphrodite, as the illustrator imagined it, was both an equilibrium of unlike qualities and a redundant melding of extra.limbs and organs. This image bears a striking resemblance to a fifteenth-century manuscript illumination of Ovid's Metamorphoses (Fig. 2, p. 207), which depicts the Ovidian hermaphrodite as conjoined bodies split at the waist. The similarities between the two images point to the debt of the alchemical imagination to Ovid's tale. In both illustrations, the male and female bodies are fused into a new shape that still retains the distinct characteristics of its parts-the neither and the both. In the Aurora consurgens, the animals clasped in the hands of the hermaphrodite add yet another level of meaning. The rabbit, which symbolizes alchemical "fixity," hints at the hypersexual- ity of rabbits: both male and female rabbits were thought to give birth, and they were sometimes considered to be hermaphroditic.37 The bat, symboliz- ing alchemical "volatility," likewise invokes the hermaphroditism or split 36 Obrist, 188-89. 37 See, for instance, Boswell, 141-43, 303-7. 205</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS + APRIL 2008 FIGURE 1.

Perhaps due to the enthusiasm of aristocrats for the alchemical manufacture of gold, the Book enjoyed enough success to survive in at least twenty manuscripts, many of which are vividly illustrated. The Book's illuminations resemble those of the Aurora consurgens inasmuch as they also depict the alchemical stone as a biform, hermaphroditic human, but they further explore medieval understandings of Christ as male and female to develop a new pair of images: the Jesus- Mary hermaphrodite and the Antichrist hermaphrodite. Central to the Book of the Holy Trinity is the author's claim that Christ contains within him his mother, the Virgin Mary, who comprises his femi- nine principle, as well as the principle of his humanity. The author states that "one can never see the mother of God without also seeing that God eternally hides and intermingles [his mother] within him. God was and is eternally his own mother and his own father, human and divine, his divinity and his humanity intermingled within. And he depends on that which he wishes to be hidden most of all within himself, the divine and the human, the feminine and the masculine."40 The author further emphasizes the in- separable nature of Christ and Mary: The humanity of bright Mary was the interior and exterior hu- manity of God Jesus Christ all made together; he had not and has no other humanity. The two are thus eternal without end ... And they have been eternally one, the Divinity Jesus Christ, which can- 39 On this work, see Obrist, 117-82; Denis Duveen, "Le Livre de la tres sainte trinite," Ambix 3 (1948): 26-32; Herwig Buntz, "Das Buch der heiligen Dreifaltigkeit: Sein Autor und seine Oberlieferung," Zeitschrift fiir deutsches Altertum und deutsche Litteratur 101 (1972): 150-60; W.

The author of the Book also explicitly equates the hermaphrodite Christ with the hermaphrodite stone, writing: "[There] rose Christ, Jesus-Mary, the red stone, the carbuncle, throughout all the same thing. They could not be separated, and they will never be separated. And in the same way, Jesus and Mary are one blood, one moon, one sun."42 The author relies here upon the traditional understanding of the philosophers' stone as male and female, sulphur and mercury, and, invoking the astro- nomical imagery of the Tabula smaragdina, sun and moon. The red stone that transmutes metals into gold is also synonymous with the fusion of Jesus and Mary, whose union epitomizes the yoking of contraries that char- acterized the hermaphrodite in alchemical thought. The author of the Book appears to have borrowed and conflated earlier images of the philosophers' stone as Christ with understandings of the stone as hermaphroditic, arriv- ing at a vision of the hermaphroditic Christ-stone. As in Petrus Bonus' text, the narrative of the stone's life and Christ's life become one: both are nature and supernature, male and female, human and divine-the poles of the spectrum tethered together. The alchemical hermaphrodite is an eminently desirable union of opposites that transcends the normal operations of na- ture, a disruption akin to metal transmutation, the ultimate goal of the alchemist's work. Hermaphroditism is for the author of the Book such a significant trope that it characterizes not only Christ, but also Antichrist. The anonymous writer of the Book was almost certainly a descendent of the "Spiritual Fran- ciscans," a radical sect of Franciscan friars who advocated absolute poverty and expected the appearance of Antichrist and the apocalyptic climax of 41 Mellon MS 74, fol. 25r: "[L]a transparente humanite de Marie claire &amp;toit I'humanite interieur et exterieur de Dieu Jesus Christus tout a fait ensemble il n'a eu et n'a point d'autre humanite toutes les deux sont icy eternelles sans fin....

Because Antichrist was in all senses a perversion of Christ, he had to share in and subvert all of Christ's attributes, including his hermaphroditic nature. As Jesus contained the Vir- gin Mary and the female sex within him, so Antichrist also would contain his own mother.44 A dramatic pair of illuminations represents these paired entities-the good Jesus-Mary hermaphrodite and the evil Antichrist her- maphrodite-a melding of male and female bodies in the costumes of kings and queens. In the image of the Antichrist hermaphrodite, a serpentine monster extends two snakelike appendages to wrap around the legs of the hermaphrodite (Fig. 3, p. 211). One appendage ends in a male head, the other in a female head; they press their faces together near Antichrist's groin, suggesting the figure's hermaphroditic genitalia. These images resem- ble the fifteenth-century illumination of Ovid's Salmacis and Hermaphrodi- tus or the Aurora consurgens' conjoined hermaphrodite, and they suggest a single entity that embodies contrary male and female qualities in equal proportions. The Jesus-Mary and Antichrist hermaphrodites must be read in light of the growing significance of mysticism in the late Middle Ages, which developed the tropes of the feminized Christ and Christ as mother. Al- though depictions of God or Jesus as mother were common in biblical scrip- ture and patristic texts, these images found new popularity in the high and late Middle Ages, particularly in the writings of Cistercian monks and cer- tain female mystics.45 In the twelfth century, Bernard of Clairvaux, Aelred of Rievaulx, and William of St. Thierry, among others, spoke of Jesus in maternal language. Their contemporary, the mystic Elizabeth of Sch6nau, referred to Christ's humanity as a female virgin in her Visiones, an equation that is repeated in the Book of the Holy Trinity. In the late fourteenth cen- tury, the English anchorite Julian of Norwich wrote her Revelationes, a work replete with her imaginings of the feminine characteristics of God.46 These examples point to a long tradition of assigning female gender traits 43 Obrist, 133.

But the fourteenth-century Ovide moralise of Pierre Bersuire makes a clear connection between the hermaphrodite of Ovid's tale and Christ, writing that: "for that son of Mercury [Hermaphroditus] is the son of God, bride- groom above all . . . he descended to the fountain of mercy, that is the blessed Virgin, where at once that nymph, that is, human nature, joined itself to him, and thus he adhered to himself through the blessed incarna- tion, since from two natures one being resulted."47 Here, the narratives of Ovid's hermaphrodite and Christ's incarnation are joined explicitly. The human and divine natures within Christ create a hermaphroditic union fa- cilitated by the impregnated body of the Virgin Mary. Although this under- standing of Christ is not identical to that of the Book, it is clear that by the fifteenth century a number of texts were circulating that identified Jesus as a feminine or hermaphroditic figure while noting the role of the Virgin in furnishing Jesus with his humanity. It is possible that the author or illustrator of the Book was also aware of Jewish interpretations of Genesis 1:27 ("And God created man to his own image, to the image of God he created him; male and female he created them") as indicative of a hermaphroditic adam and, by extension, a her- maphroditic creator.48 Although this reading was repeatedly denounced by Christian theologians, the need for clarification may indicate the persistence of such an interpretation. The production of Eve from Adam's rib may also have suggested the embodiment of the female within the male at the mo- ment of creation, indicating that hermaphroditism should be a part of al- chemical creation as well. Narratives that highlight the female sex as hidden within a seemingly male body appear in a number of medieval saints' lives. Hagiographical accounts of the saints Pelagia and Marina celebrate the piety of women who concealed their actual female sex while they lived as male monks among men.49 47 "Iste enim puer filius Mercurii est Dei filius super omnia sponsus. . . . iste in fontem misericordie i. beatam Virginem descendit, ubi statim nimpha ista i. natura humana cum eo se coniunxit, et sic sibi per beatam incarnationem adhesit quod ex duabus naturis una persona resultavit."

The cult of the hermaphrodite martyr Wilgefortis, the patron saint of monsters, was at its height in Germany during the fifteenth century, at the same time as the composition of the Book of the Holy Trinity.5a Illustrations and sculptures of the saint depict him/her as a bearded woman crucified on a cross in imitatio Christi. Wilgefortis, who is nearly indistinguishable from Christ, hangs from the cross with one shoe off, one shoe on. According to David Williams, an empty slipper was a common symbol for the female sex organ. He views this "one-shoe-off, one-shoe-on" imagery as a playful icono- graphical allusion to male and female genitalia and an indication of the saint's-and Christ's-hermaphroditic nature (Fig. 4, p. 214).51 Some im- ages of the saint also include the phrase Salvator mundi (Savior of the World), a verbal cue that enhanced the viewer's identification of Wilgefortis with the hermaphrodite Christ.52 The representation of hermaphroditism by means of a lateral division in footwear moreover resembles the biform Jesus-Mary hermaphrodite in the Book, who wears male clothing on one side and female clothing on the other to denote his/her hermaphroditic sex. Another quintessential creator according to the medieval Christian worldview, Nature, was also variously depicted as male, female, or her- maphroditic. Natura artifex, a late antique and medieval figure spanning from Macrobius' fifth-century Somnium Scipionis to Alain of Lille's twelfth-century De planctu naturae, was a feminine goddess who wielded stereotypically masculine tools.53 In De planctu naturae, for instance, Alain of Lille describes Nature as a scholar who adopts the language and the authority of a clerical male. Nature is both a mother and a virgin, yet Alain shows the goddess creating humans by means of a hammer and stylus, tools the author principally uses to designate male sexual activity. Nature is for Alain in possession of both a womb and a phallus, and thus a hermaphro- -1 On Wilgefortis, see Williams, 309-17; Ilse E.

For alchemists pondering the philosophers' stone, the metaphor of the hermaphrodite was an attractive solution. Ovid's stories of metamorphosis mirrored the alchemists' goal in metal transmutation-the change of one thing into another-and the hybrid nature of the hermaphrodite provided a useful model for the hybrid philosophers' stone. The metamorphosis of two individuals into a single creature of biform sex was particularly useful to characterize the sexed elemental qualities with which alchemists believed they worked, as well as the biform quality of the alchemical product. The hermaphrodite also satisfied the need to solve the linguistic puzzle of the "rebis," or "two thing." Moreover, the image fit readily within the conven- tional vocabulary of sexual reproduction used in scholastic natural philoso- phy and medicine. But Ovid's tale was not the only model of hermaphroditism available to alchemical authors. Traditional stories of creation, whether by God or by Nature, played upon the masculine and feminine aspects of the creator. These examples were likely inspirations for alchemical authors, who em- phasized the masculine and feminine qualities of the alchemical agent in order to establish it as a creator in its own right. Furthermore, since many alchemists drew a parallel between the philosophers' stone and Jesus, the longstanding tradition of imagining Jesus as both masculine and feminine seems to have been influential. The goal of alchemical writing was to ex- plain and defend the process of metal generation, particularly the genera- tion of gold and silver. How better to explain generation than by means of a generator that was male and female, active and passive? The rationale behind the philosophers' stone was more persuasive when one imagined the substance as both mother and father, and thus capable of creating new forms through itself. When alchemists portrayed their art as creative, they 54 Jordan, 70-71. 5 Mechtild Modersohn, Natura als Gettin im Mittelalter: Ikonographische Studien zu Darstellungen der personifizierten Natur (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1997), 35-44 and figs. 10 and 15a. 215</page><page sequence="24">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS + APRIL 2008 did so by using the models of creation at their disposal: the medical lan- guage of sexual generation, the biblical language of genesis, and the literary language of metamorphosis. CONCLUSION The metaphor of the hermaphrodite in premodern alchemical texts pro- vides historians with an opportunity to think about the fluidity of bound- aries between metals, as well as that between other sorts of bodies. Alchemy was perhaps in a unique position to capitalize upon the bothness and nei- therness of the hermaphrodite. For alchemists, the mixture of sulphur and mercury produced a hybrid of its male and female components; this product was also a new and third substance that was neither male nor female. Al- chemy held that change was possible, both in the creation of the hybrid philosophers' stone from its contrary parts, and in its transformation of metals during transmutation. The analogy of the hermaphrodite tapped into the fertility of Ovid's story of metamorphosis, invoking the playfulness and instability of its reality. Ovid's hermaphrodite, like the philosophers' stone, was not a complete transformation, but rather the creation of a third thing that held aspects of the previous two in tension. A hermaphrodite was thus a dramatic, and sometimes unsettling, union of opposites-whether male and female, heavenly and earthly, or natural and artificial. Alchemy's advocates followed this argument to its logical conclusion: Christ-the ulti- mate union of male and female, human and divine-must also be in some sense hermaphroditic. I have argued that authors and illustrators solved the problem of the "two thing" and imagined the alchemical hermaphrodite by relying upon earlier models of hermaphroditism in medical, theological, and mythologi- cal literature. But how closely did the alchemical hermaphrodite really cor- respond to the models that inspired it? The philosophers' stone was not really an intermediate point on a continuum of sex difference, as the Hippo- cratic/Galenic medical model held, nor could it really be the result of exces- sive generative matter, as the Aristotelian natural philosophical model argued (and no matter what illustrations from the Aurora and the Book might have suggested). Similarly, the alchemical hermaphrodite did not fol- low the narrative of Ovid's hermaphrodite precisely. The substance was not "enfeebled" as a result of the change, as Hermaphroditus lamented in the Metamorphoses, and alchemical authors tended to emphasize the bothness 216</page><page sequence="25">DeVun + Science and Sex Difference in Premodern Europe rather than the more disturbing neitherness of hybridity.56 Yet the alchemi- cal hermaphrodite shared a significant element of Ovid's tale: it forced con- traries together, highlighting their inherent differences. This process is evident in the Book of the Holy Trinity, in which the Jesus-Mary hermaph- rodite is a unity of integral and unmixed figures. Although Jesus and Mary comprise one substance that cannot be separated, the two characters retain their distinct identities and qualities. This achievement of neitherness and bothness was outside the ordinary course of nature, and it was the agent of wondrous transformative possibilities, such as the salvation of humankind and, on a lesser scale, metal transmutation. It is worth noting that the alchemical hermaphrodite stands in stark contrast to the ambiguous position of intersex people in premodern society. Unlike the deformed monster of De secretis mulierum or the suspect figure of De vitio sodomitico, the Jesus-Mary hermaphrodite of the Book of the Holy Trinity is presented as an ideal. The hermaphroditic philosophers' stone and the hermaphroditic Jesus transmuted metals and redeemed hu- mans by means of their special and paradoxical both-neither natures. So why was it permissible for both-neither hermaphrodites to exist in alchemy, but not in society? The hermaphrodite in alchemy was of course a purely intellectual conceit. There was no danger of alchemical hermaphrodites committing sodomitical acts or creating confusion about their genders in social or juridical contexts. Nevertheless, there was something transgressive about them. The fluidity of sexes in the alchemical hermaphrodite hinted at the fluidity of boundaries between metals, which alchemy argued could be changed through the art of the alchemist. Whether the boundaries in ques- tion divided the sexes or the categories of humanity and divinity, the her- maphrodite of alchemical literature indicated that such boundaries were crossable. In later centuries, the image of the alchemical hermaphrodite provided an opportunity to question contemporary gender roles and sexu- ality, as scholars such as Kathleen P. Long have shown.-7 Furthermore, the crossing of boundaries in alchemical literature was linked to not disorder or confusion, but the creation of something precious. The hermaphrodite was a necessary agent in the transmutation of gold and silver; it was a means to understand the God-man that was Jesus, the agent of human sal- vation. The alchemical hermaphrodite may at first appear to be an obscure figure, part of a literary genre known for its esotericism, if for nothing else. 56 Ovid, Metamorphoses, 4.380-81. 57 Long, 237-43. 217</page><page sequence="26">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS + APRIL 2008 Yet the alchemical hermaphrodite interrogated the stability of some of the most inviolable boundaries in the premodern world, and it offered a dis- course of fluidity that was not prominent in other sorts of naturalist texts. Although historians have often looked to natural philosophical and medical documents for information about premodern categories of sex (and other kinds of) difference, alchemical texts still constitute unexplored territory. Perhaps alchemical writings can tell us something important and unex- pected about the ways in which premodern naturalists imagined their world and its ability to confound categorization. Although alchemy was never a university discipline, its proponents and audience were among the elites most likely to discuss and construct the boundaries of the natural world. Manuals of alchemy and "books of secrets" that included alchemical con- cepts were popular among literate audiences, and such texts became even more widely available with the advent of the printing press."8 Despite prohi- bitions against the art, alchemical research was long supported by royal and papal courts, and many of its known practitioners were physicians, university masters, and even prelatess.9 The alchemical texts discussed in this article may therefore serve as valuable insights into the presuppositions of such thinkers about social, natural philosophical, and theological norms. Because alchemy existed alongside sanctioned academic disciplines, bor- rowing from them and informing them, it provided an alternative view of the natural and social world that had enormous-yet generally unacknowl- edged-influence. I hope that a closer look at the image of the alchemical hermaphrodite will help us to think about the use of language and symbol in European naturalist texts, as well as what we cannot otherwise know about authors' and readers' understanding of difference, of change, and of the most central tenets of their society and religion.
