In his attempt to show that Greek philosophy was incompatible with Islam, theologian al-Ghazzall charged Muslim philosophers with unbelief (kufr) on three counts: the eternity of the world, bodily resurrection, and God's knowledge of particulars. According to him the philosophers could not prove that God knows the particulars of His creation or even Himself. The issue of God's knowledge of particulars was particularly significant within an Islamic context. According to the Qur'an God knows not only Himself but also all individuals. Otherwise, how can He know for instance individual prophets or pass judgement on Doomsday? Averroes' task is to show that philosophy, more specifically Aristotle's philosophy, does provide an answer to the problem that is compatible with Islam. His response stands squarely in the Aristotelian philosophical tradition. His Aristotelian affiliation is evinced by an endorsement of Aristotle's fundamental conception of God as Prime Mover and Intellect—its principal activity consisting in thinking itself—expressed in such works as the Physics and the Metaphysics. This conception is also shared by such Muslim philosophers as Alfarabi (d. 950) and Avicenna (d. 1037). On the other hand his concern with divine providence and the underlying theory of God's omnipotence is best understood within the context of Islamic theology, although it had been discussed by Hellenistic philosophers such as Alexander of Aphrodisias. In his treatment of the topic, Averroes is aware of earlier theological and philosophical discussions. The main target of al-Ghazzali's criticism was Avicenna. Avicenna's theory of God's knowledge of particulars, specifically his contention that God knows particulars in a universal way, a formulation which triggered al-Ghazzali's criticism, has been ©The Author (2006).

In what follows I begin with an exposition of Avicenna's conception of God's knowledge in general and more specifically His knowledge of particulars. I go on to expound Ghazzall's criticism of Avicenna's theory, as well as the appraisal of that theory in modern scholarship. Finally, I give an account of Averroes' treatment of this topic and examine the effectiveness of his response to al-Ghazzall. AVICENNA'S CONCEPTION OF GOD'S KNOWLEDGE God is conceived by Avicenna not only as the necessary being and cause of all causes, but also as pure intellect and pure activity. God, who is Himself identified with intellect and thought, is permanently active.2 An important distinction between thought and matter is that matter is bound to extension (it occupies space, and can be divided), 1 One study explicitly devoted to Averroes' theory of God's knowledge of particulars, based on Latin translations of his works, is Manser's 'Die gottliche Erkenntnis der Einzelndinge und die Vorsehung bei Averroes', Jahrbuch fiir Philosophie und spekulativ Tbeologie, 23 (1909) 1-29. (This paper has been reprinted in Islamic Philosophy, vol. 62: Abu l-Walid Muhammad ibn Rusbd, Texts and Studies I, Tahafut al-Tahafut and General Topics (collected and repr. by Fuat Sezgin, with Mazen Amawi, Carl Ehrig-Eggert, Eckhard Neubauer; Frankfurt-am-Main: Publications of the Institute for the History of Arabic Islamic Science, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, 1999), 143-71.) Manser holds that Averroes never denied that God knows particulars, although such a denial was attributed to Latin Averroism. A more recent study of Tahafut al-tahafut by Maiza Ozcoidi offers an overview of recent opinions on Averroes' response. According to her, both Barry Kogan (Averroes and the Metaphysics of Causation (Albany, NY: SUNY, 1985), 230) and Thĕrĕse-Anne Druart ('Averroes on God's knowledge of being qua being' Anaquel de Estudios Arabes (Madrid: Editorial Complutense, 5), 1994, 48) call into question the effectiveness of Averroes' case for God's knowledge of particulars: see La Concepcion de la Filosofia en Averroes-. Andlisis del Tahafut al-tahafut (Trotta: Madrid, 2001), 231-40. Maiza Ozcoidi argues that according to Averroes God does know particulars, but in a way that is inaccessible to human understanding.

Thought is the opposite of matter, which is pure passivity. Therefore, that which knows and is pure activity is not mixed with matter.3 And because God, the necessary Being, is pure thought and completely detached from matter, He Himself is knowledge,4 on the assumption that, in God, thought equals knowledge.5 Also, in the perfect Being, the subject of knowledge corresponds to the object of knowledge, which is also in accordance with the Aristotelian principle that 'knowledge in act is identical with its object'.6 In his Maqasid al-falasifa, a summary of Avicenna's philosophy based on the Danishnama, the Book of Knowledge, al-Ghazzali reproduces this view, asserting that: 'once it is established that the [object] known is the knowing [subject] itself, the knowledge, the knower and the known become identical. Therefore the First is in itself knower and its knowledge and the [object] known are [identical with] it'. As pure activity, God is also the first cause of all intelligibles, from which all existents proceed. Because those intelligibles originate from God through His thinking Himself, i.e. through His knowledge, He must have a perfect knowledge of His creation, and of all that originates from Him. One problem arises at this stage: if, as was postulated, God's knowledge is identical with its object and if the object of His knowledge is a multitude of entities, must one relinquish the doctrine of God's oneness, established as befitting His intellectual 3 Avicenna (ed.

Avicenna claims that because God is the cause of the intelligibles, and because they are not the cause of His knowing them, there need not arise a multiplicity in the knower. God knows them as their creator. In his treatment of God's knowledge, Avicenna stresses its difference from human knowledge, not just in nature but also with regard to the process of its acquisition. Unlike God, humans are entangled in matter and live in a material world that is subject to change. Therefore, Avicenna claims that knowledge obtained by humans is the result of a process of separating form from matter in any given existent.8 In contrast to divine knowledge, human knowledge is passive in relation to its objects in the sense that it is caused by the existence of these objects, when they present themselves to the knowing subject.9 As a consequence, in their capacity as recipients of knowledge—because the objects known to them are the cause, not the effect of their perceiving them—they have no grasp of all intelligibles as a unity. The difference between human and divine knowledge is tied up with the notion that divine knowledge is purely intellectual while human knowledge is dependent on sense perception, and has to do away progressively with the material element in the objects it perceives in order to attain the form. Also, God knows all existents in an all-encompassing fashion, inasmuch as He is their cause, whereas humans usually have to perceive objects individually and in a temporal sequence, in order to separate form from matter and thereby attain the universal notions of species and genus that serve to classify each existent. Human knowledge is seen to proceed from the particular to the universal. This process is accompanied by the activity of the dator formarum, which imparts forms to the human intellect from without. God, being pure intellect, bears no relation to the material world of coming to be and passing away, as He is pure intellect, and is therefore unchangeable. This also means, according to Avicenna, that He bears no relation to time. Change—and time, which is an expression and measure of the process of change—only originates as a result of the combination of matter and form in a substance, together with its accidents. Moreover it is matter, while being the passive element in a substance, which allows 8 Avicenna, Danishndma, 83-4, Le livre de science, i. 194. For intellectual forms of non-discursive thought see Adamson, 'Non-discursive Thought in Avicenna's Commentary on the Theology of Aristotle', in J. McGinnis (ed. with D. Reisman) Interpreting Avicenna: Science and Philosophy in Medieval Islam (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 87-111, esp. 95, 103. 9 Avicenna, Danishndma, 86, Le livre de science, i. 195-6.</page><page sequence="5">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS l8l it to become individuated. Forms alone do not suffice for the purpose of individualization (such as a particular man) of primary substances. Particulars are always a compound of form and matter. The question now arises: if God bears no relation to matter and temporality, which are both closely related, and if the sensory equipment needed for the apprehension of particulars is not attributable to Him, can we say that He knows particulars, or are we forced to admit that His knowledge extends exclusively to universals? And how is it possible for Him to know temporal processes? Avicenna was well aware of the problem and His account of God's knowledge of particulars was an attempt to answer possible objections. Can God actually know particulars as they come to be and pass away? Avicenna claims that God cannot know things in time because, as a result of the identification of being and thought, should He know contingent things or events in time He would become changeable like them, which is inconceivable of God.10 Avicenna gives the example of an eclipse. Before an eclipse, an astronomer is aware that it is not currently taking place. During the eclipse he knows that it is happening at the present moment, and after the eclipse he knows it as a past event. Avicenna wants to illustrate the fact that in the process of knowing in the case of humans, the knowledge of the particular eclipse changes along with the process of the eclipse.11 The temporal process of the eclipse is accompanied by, and concomitant with, the temporal process of acquiring knowledge. Avicenna concludes that God knows the process of the eclipse in a universal way: He knows the succession of movements in any given star as it becomes eclipsed by another star from an eternal perspective, His knowledge and His being remaining unaltered. This implies that there is no reference to a specific time in God's thought, and that every particular process taking place either in the sublunary or in the superlunary world is known to Him in a universal way. Al-GhazzalT epitomizes this view in his Maqasid al-falasifa: 'the First knows particulars in a universal way (bi-naw' kulli), intended as eternal, everlasting, and without change', 'and knows its cause in a universal way for there is in it no reference to a [specific] moment or time'.12 A clarification is needed here with regard to the terms 'universal' and 'particular'. A distinction must be drawn, if one follows Marmura, in the use of the term 'universal' for it can refer to '(a) the nature of God's knowledge as such; (b) the manner of God's knowing; (c) the object 10 Avicenna, al-Shifa al-Ildhiyyat, ii. 359. 11 Avicenna, Danishnama, 90-3, Le livre de science, i. 199-202; al-Shifa , i. 360. 12 Al-Ghazzall, Maqasid al-falasifa, 162.</page><page sequence="6">CATARI NA BELO known by God'.13 As regards (a): 'God's knowledge is "universal" in the sense that it is "conceptual" or "intellectual".'14 First, this universal aspect or nature goes hand in hand with the conception of God as pure intellect and separated from matter. It refers to God's being outside time. His eternity was traditionally conceived not as infinite duration but as absolute detachment from time and any temporal reference. 'Universal' also means in this context that God knows particulars inasmuch as they come under the corresponding species and genera.15 Secondly, and with respect to the manner of God's knowing, He is the cause of all intelligibles and existents, in contrast with human beings, for whom knowledge is caused by its object and so ontologically preceded by it. Furthermore, according to Avicenna, God's knowledge is not discursive, it apprehends all existents 'instantaneously' (daf'atan wahidatan).16 What about the objects known to God? The example of the eclipse illustrates not only God's relation (or lack thereof) to time but also His mode of knowing particulars in a universal way as meaning that He knows them by their general nature: He 'apprehends particulars inasmuch as they are universal, that is, inasmuch as they have qualities'.17 After giving the example of the eclipse, Avicenna concludes with a Qur'anic quotation (34. 3) that reads: 'not the weight of an atom escapes Him, either in the heavens or in the earth'. The quotation serves to corroborate the notion that God knows every single particular on earth as in heaven. Does Avicenna truly believe that God knows particulars, and does his exposition show that that is the case? Or is he just trying to hide his true view under Islamic trappings? Avicenna's concern in raising the issue of God's knowledge of particulars, in spite of the Aristotelian framework, apparent notably in the terms used by Avicenna, goes beyond Aristotle's framework of inquiry, because for Aristotle it was more fitting of the First, that it should not know particulars. However, since for Avicenna it was of paramount importance to put forth the notion of God's universal providence, the issue becomes a crucial one, and this is made explicit by al-Ghazzali's charge of kufr. 13 Marmura, 'Avicenna's Theory of God's Knowledge of Particulars', 300. 14 Ibid, 301. 15 Avicenna, al-Shifa, al-llabiyyat, ii. 364, 1.2. Quoted in Marmura, 'Avicenna's Theory of God's Knowledge of Particulars', 302. 16 Ibid, 303: 'God's knowledge does not move from "concept to concept" to apply to the ontological series as well as to the temporal. The entire ontological series is conceived instantaneously, intuitively. God knows, as it were, all the necessitated consequences in a timeless intuition. In other words, there is no discursus in God's knowledge.' 1 Ibid. Avicenna, al-Shifa , Ildhiyyat, ii. 360, 1.3.</page><page sequence="7">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 183 AL-GHAZZALFS CRITICISM OF AVICENNA Al-Ghazzali's criticism is based on a conception of God and of His attributes which is fundamentally different from that of Avicenna. Al-GhazzalT starts by undermining the very fundamental conception of God as intellect put forth by the philosophers. Unlike the philosophers, and following the Ash'ari tradition of considering divine attributes as real entities, he does not accept the absolute identity of God and knowledge. Hence this knowledge must be proved by a different way than simply stating that He is knowledge. Hence Avicenna's argument that God knows Himself and also all existents because His essence is knowledge is rebutted by al-Ghazzall as question-begging.18 As for the claim that He knows them inasmuch as He knows Himself to be their principle, al-Ghazzall claims that the knowledge of Himself differs from the knowledge of Himself as principle of other beings. The assumption of self-knowledge in the First does not prove that His knowledge reaches beyond His own essence: 'the existence of self-knowledge simultaneously with the non-existence of the knowledge of something else is not impossible, nor is this impossible with the knowledge of the First and its knowledge of something else'.19 In his alternative to Avicenna's conception, al-Ghazzali presents the theologians' argument in support of God's knowledge of Himself and others, i.e. His creatures. In a nutshell, according to al-Ghazzall, it is by affirming a will in God that we infer His knowledge: 'The universe is known to Him, for the universe was willed by Him and produced by Him, and nothing comes into existence but what is produced through His will, and nothing is everlasting but His essence alone. And once it was established that God wills and knows what He wills, He must be necessarily living, and every living being knows other than itself, and He is the most capable of knowing Himself. Therefore the whole universe is known to God, and they understood this through this argument, since they had found that He willed everything that happens in the world'.20 In order to substantiate his criticism, al-Ghazzall accuses Avicenna of failing to prove that God has a will. Because the world eternally 18 Al-Ghazzall quoted in Averroes (ed. Maurice Bouyges S.J.), Tahafot at-Tahafot (Beirut: Dar el-Machreq, 1930 [1987]), 431.

To illustrate this criticism and in order to explain that, according to this theory, God could not prevent Himself from creating the world, al-Ghazzali gives the example of the action of the sun in producing light.21 In order to refute their proof of God's knowledge of particulars, al-Ghazzali furthermore delves into the philosophers' denial of the attributes of seeing and hearing, and their affirmation of God's total detachment from matter. He states that God, if one is to follow their theories, cannot know individuals, because 'the individual Zayd can only be distinguished from cAmr through the senses, not through the intellect'.22 The problems arising from the lack of a connection between God and matter is a particularly important point to which I shall return. After putting forth his demolishing criticism, al-Ghazzali draws the consequences of Avicenna's theory regarding God's knowledge of particulars. In addition to leading to the conclusion that man is more knowledgeable than God, for humans know particulars, it clashes with Islamic doctrine on several counts. Not knowing any particular events or accidents in time or in space, God would be unable to tell a believer from an unbeliever, would not know the time when the Prophet proclaimed himself as such, and would be unable to know any particular prophet.23 Quite apart from going against the idea of God's omniscience, the philosophers also destroy alongside it the notion of God's justice, mercy and compassion—for He cannot administer justice if He is unaware of individuals—and God's generosity, for He cannot be praised for an act, i.e. creation, which is involuntary. Their theories, according to al-Ghazzali, also undermine the idea of God's caring rule over this world, His providence. Al-Ghazzali thus takes Avicenna's statement that God knows particulars in a universal way as tantamount to denying God's knowledge of particulars. He further holds that Avicenna's cosmology, his emanation theory, leads to a denial of any knowledge in God. Before going on to present Averroes' proposed solution it is useful to take further account of Marmura's position, which focuses on the usage of 'universal' and 'particular' by Avicenna. 21 Al-Ghazzall quoted in Averroes, Tahafot, 438. 22 Ibid, 457; Tahafut, i. 276. 23 Averroes, Tahafot, 457-8.</page><page sequence="9">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 185 Can God truly have a knowledge of all particulars by way of knowing general principles or genera and species? According to Marmura this method can only be successfully used in the supralunary world. God, by knowing general principles, may indeed know not just the eclipse in general but also each and every particular eclipse.24 However, this does not entitle Him to know just any particular, and the example of the eclipse is, on Marmura's interpretation, misleading: Avicenna used it in order to ward off criticism from the theologians, while putting across in a veiled fashion his true conception of God's knowledge, which appears to be more in keeping with the Aristotelian view—stressing that God knows primarily Himself, and Alexander's view that God does not know strictly everything with a necessary knowledge, e.g. future contingents—than with the Qur anic quotation expressly asserting God's absolute omniscience. On Marmura's interpretation, the condition for God's knowledge of particulars or individuals is that the entity known be the only member of its species, itself invariable and eternal, and the event known involve such an entity. This prerequisite is met only by entities existing in the celestial realm,25 the celestial spheres—precisely those involved in an eclipse. However, this excludes particulars in the sublunary world, the world of coming to be and passing away, the rules governing which are not as strict and regular as the rules governing the celestial spheres in the supralunary world. Therefore, 'God's individual knowledge of particulars is restricted to entities and events in the celestial realm'.26 Marmura's conclusion is that both the Qur'anic quotation and the example of the eclipse are meant to mislead the theologians.27 Marmura focuses on the example of the eclipse as the key to understanding Avicenna's position. But if we take the example of the eclipse it becomes apparent that in knowing the eclipse God is aware of the chronological order, for an eclipse is a temporal process. One might object that Avicenna means a general eclipse, not each particular eclipse, but this would render the example meaningless and go against Marmura's interpretation, according to which on Avicenna's account God knows particulars in the world above the moon. The objection made by al-Ghazzal! that according to Avicenna God does not know temporal processes is thus quashed. The second aspect concerns 24 Marmura, 'Avicenna's Theory of God's Knowledge of Particulars', 310. 25 This principle had already been formulated by Alfarabi (trans. Walzer, al-Farabi on the Perfect State, 116): 'but in the case of something immaterial, nothing can be of its species except itself.' 26 Marmura, 'Avicenna's Theory of God's Knowledge of Particulars', 311. 27 Marmura's view is contradicted by other texts in which Avicenna is clearer. See Y.Michot, Lettre au vizir Abu Sad (Beirut: Les Editions al-Bouraq, 2000).</page><page sequence="10">i86 CATARINA BELO sublunar particulars, composed of matter and form. Aristotle made a significant distinction between the causality governing the sublunary world and that governing the supralunary world, a strict and regular causality being confined to the supralunary world. Marmura's inter pretation of Avicenna's views presupposes the Aristotelian strict distinction. Yet in a passage from the Physics of al-Shifa concerning future knowledge, this distinction is clearly put aside. According to Avicenna, in the same way that one who knows the principles which rule the occurrence of an eclipse will know, in the right circumstances, that an eclipse is going to take place, 'equally, if that person knows that matter is becoming putrescent, he knows that a fever is in the offing'.28 In this instance Avicenna is not referring to divine knowledge in particular but to knowledge in general and more specifically human knowledge. Yet in doing away with the Aristotelian distinction between sublunary and supralunary worlds Avicenna shows that matter is in principle no more unpredictable than celestial motions. Matter is the cause which individualizes particulars and hence would constitute the obstacle to God's knowledge. Yet matter is not an autonomous principle, but wholly subordinated to form in Avicenna's philosophy, and does not contribute to the actuality of the thing's existence: 'Matter does not avail (yufidu) the thing in actuality, rather it contributes the potentiality of the thing's existence. In turn the form is that which turns it into actuality'.2" Thus notwithstanding Avicenna's formulation of divine knowledge as a knowledge of particulars in a universal way, his philosophy points in principle to a theory of true divine omniscience. Al-Ghazzall does not take into account the complexity and diversity of Avicenna's approach to the issue of divine knowledge, and possibly did not have at his disposal other works in which Avicenna expands on the issue. At any rate he focuses on those aspects which lend themselves to attack from a theologian's perspective. However, the issue of God's knowledge is an abiding theme in Avicenna's works. In al-Taliqat, for instance, Avicenna explicitly states that if God is the cause of causes then all causes are subordinated to His power and knowledge. More specifically, he says that if the First knows His concomitants and the concomitants of His concomitants according to the way in which effect derives from cause, and knows which effect derives from which cause He knows everything in a universal way. God appears to know 28 Avicenna (eds. S. Zayid and I. Madkur), al-Shifa, al-Tabiiyyat, al-TabVi (Cairo: al-Hay'a al-Misriyya al-'Amma li-l-Kitab, 1983), 11. 29 Ibid, 37. al-Sama</page><page sequence="11">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 187 everything according to laws of nature set by Himself. Since there are no inexplicable deviations to His laws, a stance which goes hand in hand with Avicenna's determinism, He would effectively know the process behind the coming to be of each individual.30 Avicenna's overall determinism, expressed in the principle that whatever comes to be does so through a necessary cause, and ultimately through God, supports his stance on divine omniscience.31 This becomes clear in Averroes' appraisal and revision of Avicenna's formulation.32 AVERROES' RESPONSE TO AL-GHAZZALI The problem of God's knowledge of particulars is broached by Averroes in such diverse works as Fasl al-maqal (The Decisive Treatise), the Damlma, a shorter treatise attached to the Fasl, and his commentary on Book Lambda of Aristotle's Metaphysics, part of which treats specifically of the nature of God's knowledge. But it is in Tahafut al-Tahafut that he provides a full rebuttal of al-Ghazzall's criticism. In what follows I will first look into Averroes' theory inasmuch as it agrees with Avicenna's, and the philosophers', view of God. Secondly, closer attention will be paid to the main points of agreement between Averroes' and Avicenna's views on God's knowledge. Finally, I discuss the main divergences 30 Avicenna (ed. A. Badawi), Kitab al-Taliqat (Cairo: al-Hay'a al-Misriyya al-'Amma li-l-Kitab, 1973), 14. 31 'As long as one thing's existence does not necessarily derive from its causes and does not leave the nature of the possible it does not come to be from them': Avicenna, al-Shifa, al-Tabi'iyydt, al-Sama al-Tabi'i, 63. At the metaphysical level Avicenna does not believe that something can occur or come into being without a necessitating, determining cause. His case for determinism is further stated in natural philosophy. Avicenna denies that anything in nature can come about through chance, in a haphazard or spontaneous way. See C. Belo, 'Ibn SIna on Chance in the Physics of as-Sifa", in McGinnis (ed.) Interpreting Avicenna, 25-41; see also: Michot, Lettre au vizir Abu Sa'd, 122-3, App. I. 32 In a new analysis on Avicenna's theory of God's knowledge of particulars, Peter Adamson focuses on the Aristotelian epistemological background under pinning Avicenna's theory. Adamson too is sceptical about Avicenna's statement that God knows particulars in a universal way as a theory that God truly knows particulars as such. As Adamson stresses, Avicenna's theory implies certain similarities between human and divine knowledge. Yet this approach is rejected by Averroes. Avicenna's formulation of God's knowledge, as we shall see, is criticized by Averroes, hence his position is not subject to the same kind of attack. See P. Adamson, 'On Knowledge of Particulars', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 105 (2005), 273-94. For a recent defence of Avicenna's position see R. Acar, 'Reconsidering Avicenna's Position on God's Knowledge of Particulars', in McGinnis (ed.), Interpreting Avicenna, 142-56.</page><page sequence="12">i88 CATARINA BELO between Averroes' and Avicenna's conceptions of God's knowledge of particulars and ascertain how the differences put forth by Averroes can be taken as a solution to al-Ghazzali's criticism. In Tahafut al-Tahdfut, Averroes faults the Ash'ari conception of God and stands by the philosophers' conception, defending it on philosophi cal and religious grounds. His response to al-Ghazzall on the issue of God's knowledge begins with a condemnation of the theologians' anthropomorphic conception of the Godhead, whereby the First is turned into a mere eternal man,33 differing from humans only in possessing knowledge and power to a greater degree than humans, His other attributes being equally assimilated to human attributes. According to Averroes the theologians fail to understand the distinction between the eternal and the temporal planes. Their theory, in Averroes' view, is to be held blasphemous for falling short of the true conception of a transcendent God patent in the Qur'an. For Averroes, as for other Muslim philosophers before him, God is not to be seen as a body or a substance composed of form and matter. As we have seen, God is pure intellect in so far as He is wholly detached from the material element, and hence absolutely transcendent. The philosophers' denial of 'corporeal' attributes such as seeing and hearing is an obvious corollary of this. God, as a simple being, cannot be a soul, for this implies a combination of different faculties. And only the possession of a soul allows for the existence of hearing and sight in any substance.34 More to the point are the similarities between the view of Avicenna and Averroes on God's knowledge. Like Avicenna, Averroes postulates the identity between God and His all-encompassing knowledge as tied up with His immaterial nature. God is pure intellect, pure actuality, and cause of all intelligibles and existents. His knowledge of the world is concomitant with His principal activity, namely, thinking Himself. Moreover, His creation issues from Him as a result of His thinking Himself. And if the First creates through His knowledge, He must needs have knowledge of His creation, comprising all that issues from Him, directly or indirectly. God's knowledge of other beings beside Himself is due to His being their cause, as Avicenna had stated. God's knowledge is always active, causative and therefore perfect, and in stark contrast to human knowledge which is the effect of its objects, therefore passive, and potential, as it is not always active. We have seen that for Averroes as for Avicenna the nature of God's knowledge is purely intellectual. 33 Averroes, Tabdfot, 425. 34 Ibid, 454; Tabafut, i. 274: 'The philosophers only avoid ascribing to the First hearing and seeing, because this would imply its possessing a soul.'</page><page sequence="13">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 189 As to the manner of His knowledge, we know that it is always active and causative. The distinction between human and divine knowledge is better understood against the background of the philosophers' views of the human intellect. The human intellect, in its knowing process, cannot attain knowledge by itself. In this it differs markedly from the divine intellect. While the divine intellect is active and causative, the human intellect and knowledge are passive and receptive. After the similarities between Averroes and Avicenna's conception of knowledge in the First have been dealt with, the principal divergences must be taken into account. This brings us back to al-Ghazzali's condemnation and Averroes' response. Two main arguments are adduced to counter al-Ghazzali's criticism. One consists in affirming that because God is the intelligent cause of the world, He alone knows His own creation. This argument had already been advanced by Avicenna. Yet Averroes clearly demarcates his own view from Avicenna's formulation of God's knowledge of particulars as a universal knowledge, or a knowledge of particulars in a universal way. For Averroes, God's knowledge is neither universal nor particular. In addition to scrutinizing this assertion we also have to ascertain whether Averroes is here referring to the nature, manner or object of God's knowledge, or all three. Let us deal first with the nature of God's knowledge. It is fundamentally different from human knowledge, such that the same terms cannot be applied to both human and divine knowledge. A linguistic or logical aspect comes to the fore in Averroes' formulation. Why is it that the terms 'knowledge', and also 'will', cannot have the same meaning when predicated of man and God? Why does Averroes state that they are equivocally (bi-ishtirdk) applied to man and God? Equivocation, or homonymy, as opposed to univocity, is a technical term used by Aristotle at the opening of his Categories to express a set of words that bear the same name but have a different definition. In his Middle Commentary on the Categories, Averroes states that 'those things whose names are common, that is, equivocal, are things that have nothing general or common to them except for the name, while the definition of each, which states its essence in consideration of the meaning of the equivocal name, differs from the definition of the other and is peculiar to its own definiendum'.35 One would gather from this 35 Averroes (eds. M. M. Kassem, C. E. Butterworth and A. A. Haridi), Averrois Cordubensis Commentarium Medium in Aristotelis Categorias (Cairo: al-Hay'a al-Misriyya al-'Amma li-l-Kitab, 1980), 77; trans, with introd. and notes by H.A.Davidson, Averroes' Middle Commentary on Porphyry's Isagoge and on Aristotle's Categoriae (Cambridge: The Medieval Academy of America, University of California Press, [1958] 1969), 32.</page><page sequence="14">190 CATARINA BELO statement that knowledge in God has nothing in common with knowledge in humans but the name. The following sentences of this commentary show more specifically in what this difference consists. Averroes says that 'an example is the name animal when predicated both of a drawing of a man and of a rational man, for the definitions of these two differ, and the two have nothing in common except for the name'.36 The depicted man is an image of the real man and cannot be represented without a real, living model. But although the depicted man is in the mind of the painter—and similarly, the pure form is in the 'mind' of the First—there is in both cases a difference between the form which is in matter and the intellect which is being acted upon, and the form which is not in matter but in an intellect permanently active. The example illustrates the difference between God's and man's knowledge, and the radically different nature of the two. It follows from the aforementioned rejection of predicating the same attributes of humans and God in the same way, and the fact that the two do not share a genus. As regards the manner of God's knowing, Averroes says that God's knowledge is neither universal nor particular. Averroes equates universal knowledge with potential knowledge on the one hand and particular knowledge with sensory knowledge on the other. He says that: 'the knowledge of things through a universal knowledge is inadequate, for it knows them in potentiality'37 and that 'His perception is not described as universal let alone as particular, because universals are intelligibles which are consequent on and posterior to existents, whereas on the contrary the existents are consequent on this intellect'.38 Why is universal knowledge identified with potentiality? Within the process of human knowledge the terms 'particular' and 'universal' have specific meanings. 'Particular' means the sensible individual directly perceived by the human subject—it is always tied up with a sensible apprehension of the object, first perceived by means of the senses and only at a later stage by the rational faculty. In this sense, 'particular' means also partial and incomplete, for the apprehension focuses on one object or part of it, rather than its relations to other substances. Moreover this empirical process is gradual and time-bound. Because the sensory faculties are mixed with matter, they lead to an imperfection and limitation in the knowledge attained through them. God's knowledge is far removed from this type of apprehension. 36 Ibid. 37 Averroes, Tabafot, 340; Tahdfut (trans, slightly modified), i. 203. 38 Averroes, Tahdfot, 339; Tahdfut (trans, modified), i. 203.</page><page sequence="15">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 191 What about the term 'universal'? The 'universal', attained as a result of the human process of knowledge, although more valuable inasmuch as it is more comprehensive, likewise lacks perfection because it is attained indirectly and mediately. This knowledge is mediated inasmuch as it results from a process which involves the aid of the senses and of the active intellect. When this universal knowledge—the knowledge of the forms, of the species and genera—is attained, it can be applied to particular instances or processes and lead to the acquisition of an encompassing view of those objects. But God's knowledge has no parallel in human knowledge. It is forever active, because it is neither mediated by external aids or faculties—it is not the result of a process—nor by the application of principles under which particular substances or events come. Unlike Avicenna, Averroes is not compromised by the claim that God knows particulars in a universal way, i.e. 'apprehends particulars inasmuch as they are universal, that is, inasmuch as they have qualities'.39 For knowing something through its qualities, or through its coming under a genus or species, is a type of mediated and potential knowledge because it is conditioned by the apprehended intelligibles. For this reason Averroes says that 'it is impossible ... that the First should be perfected through the intelligible and caused by it'.40 Because God's knowledge is constantly active it is neither universal nor particular. Averroes states that: 'since knowledge of the individual is for us knowledge in act,41 we know that God's knowledge is more like particular knowledge than universal knowledge, although it is neither universal nor particular.'42 In the supralunary world all existents and intelligibles are already contained virtually, and so too universal and particular, for according to Averroes: 'the philosophers assert that these two kinds of knowledge, the universal and the particular, are one (ittahada) in the knowledge 39 Avicenna, al-Shifa, Ildhiyyat, ii. 360. 40 Averroes, Tahafot, 343; Tahdfut (trans, slightly modified), i. 206. 41 Kogan, Averroes and the Metaphysics of Causation, 244: 'In the Aristotelian noetic, knowledge of universals carries an additional dimension of potentiality vis-a-vis that of particulars I only knowledge of universals signifies that the particular form actually known can be taken to characterize an indefinite number of such individuals. It can be used for purposes of identification again and again, universally. In this sense, then, the universal concept is a kind of capacity to re-apply a particular act of knowing to similar cases as they arise. To the extent that knowing universals implies this added element of capacity and potentiality, it is less adequate as a description of Divine knowledge than knowing particulars, which always connotes actual knowing.' 42 Averroes, Tahafot, 345; Tahdfut (trans, slightly modified), i. 207.</page><page sequence="16">I&lt;?2. CATARINA BELO which is separated from matter; and when this knowledge emanates in the sublunary world it divides itself into universal and particular.'43 The rejection of the term 'universal' used by Avicenna to describe God's knowledge constitutes Averroes' direct response to al-Ghazzali. Moreover he does not expressly fault Avicenna for his formulation, deeming instead his own account a more accurate explanation of the philosophers' overall view on God's knowledge. Despite the fact that this clarification renders our own grasp of God's knowledge virtually impossible—for we cannot really speak of a 'mode' or process of knowledge—it enables us to distinguish it from human knowledge. The same clarification applies to will as said of man and God, and Averroes tackles both these attributes in order to refute al-Ghazzali, who had placed so much weight on the issue of God's will as providing proof of His omniscience. Averroes, who is often so critical of Avicenna on many philosophical and theological issues, is in this instance remarkably moderate in his appraisal of his predecessor's theory. An important issue remains, pertaining to the objects of God's knowledge. The terms 'particular' and 'universal' have now been rendered inappropriate to speak about God's knowledge, but is it possible, according to the philosophy of Averroes, to say that God knows in a perfect way all existents? Or, in other words, still bearing in mind al-Ghazzall's criticism, is there anything that escapes God's knowledge? Averroes and the philosophers claim that God knows all existents inasmuch as He is their absolute and ultimate cause. Again, it has to be stressed that His knowledge, will and causation are all concomitant, for each attribute is equally and perfectly active and cannot be preceded or caused by something else, for this would entail some sort of potentiality. This is also made consequent upon the philosophical identification of God's essence with His attributes. What does it mean to say that God knows all existents inasmuch as He is their cause? The term 'cause' had a fourfold meaning for Averroes as for Aristotle, as agent, form, end and matter.44 If we dwell on the issue of God as the efficient cause of the world some divergences can be observed between Averroes and Avicenna. One of the accusations levelled by al-Ghazzali at the latter consisted in claiming that in a universe where the effect of God is one, and the remaining beings derive from that first effect in a series of processions arising in the First, one cannot say that God-—who for the philosophers creates through 43 Averroes, Tabafot, 507; Tahafut (trans, slightly modified), i. 310. 44 Aristotle (ed. W. Jaeger), Metaphysics (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1957), 1013a.24-36.</page><page sequence="17">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 193 His knowledge, and knows inasmuch as He is the cause of the universe— knows anything beside His first, immediate, effect. That is to say, even on the assumption that God knows His effects, He is only responsible for one direct effect and as such He cannot be said to know that which proceeds mediately from Him, according to al-Ghazzall. Yet it has to be said that the rule that from the one only one proceeds is exclusive to a Neoplatonic emanative scheme endorsed by Avicenna but rejected by Averroes as non-Aristotelian. Avicenna's emanative scheme was seen by al-Ghazzall as hampering God's causation in the world. Also, because His causation, according to the philosophers, goes hand in hand with His knowledge, the latter was seen to be likewise affected and hampered. The rejection of emanation by Averroes lay not only it its deviation from the Aristotelian model but also because it served to obviate al-Ghazzall's criticism against the philosophers. By extending the immediate reach of divine causality, and saying that God creates all effects at once, Averroes is implicitly seeking to extend His knowledge of His effects. Although this rejection of the emanative scheme is not expressly adduced by Averroes as proof of God's all-encompassing knowledge in Tabdfut al-tahafut, it clearly has a bearing on it. However it has to be said too that al-Ghazzall's attack on the theory, defended by the philosophers, that God knows the effects that mediately proceed from Him stems from a basic divergence between Ash'ari theology and the faldsifa on divine causality. In their attempt to stress divine omnipotence, the Ash'aris thought it necessary to conclude that all events occurring in the universe, natural processes or human acts, are the result of the direct intervention and causation by God. Everything in the world is directly dependent on God, and to claim otherwise would amount to denying divine omnipotence. The faldsifa view divine causality differently and hold that God's omnipotence is not affected whether He is the direct or indirect cause of all existents and all change in the world. They further adduce the view that God's preoccupation with every single detail in the world, as Ash'aris claim to be the case, is demeaning and beneath His perfection. God must not be conceived as primarily concerned with ruling the universe, or as being directly enmeshed in human affairs, so as to be at their beck and call and depend on their acts and volitions. Nor can He be seen to change His decisions according to the way humans conduct themselves. This view is adopted by Averroes and epitomized in Tahafut al-tahdfut, as evinced by the following passage: This movement... does not occur, according to the philosophers, according to primary intention (aid l-qasd al-awwal) for the sake of this sublunary world; that is, the heavenly body is not according to primary intention created for the</page><page sequence="18">194 CATARINA BELO sake of this sublunary world. For indeed this movement is the special act for the sake of which heaven is created, and if this movement occurred according to primary intention for the sake of the sublunary world, the body of the heavens would be created only for the sake of this sublunary world, and it is impossible, according to the philosophers, that the superior should be created for the sake of the inferior; on the contrary, out of the superior there follows the existence of the inferior, just as the perfection of the ruler in relation to his subject does not lie in his being a ruler, but his being a ruler is only a consequence of his perfection. In the same way the providence ('inaya) which prevails in this world is like the care of the ruler for his subjects, who have no salvation and no existence except in him, and especially in the ruler who for his most perfect and noble existence does not need to be a ruler, let alone that he should need his subjects' existence.45 The link between providence and knowledge in this context appears in al-Ghazzall's quotation of the philosophers' views to the effect that 'The First does not know other things according to primary intention. No, it knows its own essence as the principle of the universe, and from this its knowledge of the universe follows according to secondary intention'.46 Owing to the close connection between God's knowledge and His being the foremost cause of the universe, the distinction between primary and secondary causality bears on the issue of God's knowledge, and this becomes patent in Averroes' philosophy. However the existence of a secondary causality issuing from God's creation does not detract from His power or knowledge. His knowing according to secondary intention is as perfect as His knowing according to primary intention, in the same way that His rule over the sublunary world through secondary causality is as powerful as His direct control over the supralunary world. To say that God's knowledge of the sublunary world is according to secondary intention does not mean to say that He is subordinated to a means in order to know the world of coming to be and passing away, for He is the foremost cause of everything. We have shown this to be stressed by Averroes by way of offering a different formulation to that of Avicenna as regards the 'mode' of God's knowledge. Moreover, in adopting the philosophers' views on secondary causality, Averroes in not relinquishing the Islamic notion of divine omnipotence, namely that God rules, directly or indirectly, every single existent, which goes hand in hand with the view that God creates at once all existents, rather than one single effect. 45 Averroes, Tahafot, 484-5; Tahafut (trans, slightly modified), i. 295. 46 Averroes, Tahafot, 337; Tahafut (trans, slightly modified), i. 201.</page><page sequence="19">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 195 The assumption of God as formal and final cause is rather straightforward and less complex. God is the formal cause since He, the foremost intellectual being, is the cause of all intelligibles and intellects. And He is the final cause inasmuch as all beings are drawn to him. He is that to which all creatures and beings aspire in one way or another. This is in line with the Islamic view conveyed in the Qur'an (e.g. 96. 8) that ultimately everything returns to God. As much had been maintained by Themistius, namely that the First is the efficient, formal and final cause of the universe. Averroes endorses this view, stating that God is 'an agent, a form, and an end'.47 The material cause is the more controversial in this context. It has to be said that God cannot be conceived as the material cause because He is a purely intellectual being. To admit God as the material cause of the world would be at variance with His transcendence. Aside from the difficulties besetting the view that there is an element in the world escaping God's causal influence, which detracts from His omnipotence, a real problem arises for the knowledge of God, namely that of beings that have a material element in them, i.e., all beings in the sublunary world. The crux of the question is undoubtedly the relation obtaining between God and the material element in the world. That this relation lies at the root of the challenge posed by al-Ghazzall was seen by Aquinas, who implies that God is indirectly the material cause of the world in the sense that He is the creator of prime matter. According to Aquinas, 'it must be said that, because God is the cause of things by His knowledge... His knowledge extends as far as His causality extends. Hence, as the active power of God extends not only to forms, which are the source of universality, but also to matter... the knowledge of God must extend to particulars, which are individuated through matter'.48 Since Averroes does not provide a direct response to the problem in the thirteenth discussion of Tahafut al-tahafut, which is specially dedicated to the issue of God's knowledge of particulars, a response must be sought elsewhere in this and other works by the Andalusian philosopher. 47 Averroes, Tahafot, 232; Tahafut, i. 138. 48 Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, Pt. i, Qu. 14, art. 11 (utrum Deus cognoscat singularia).

Fathers of the English Dominican Province, Maryland; Christian Classics [repr.] 1981), i. 81.</page><page sequence="20">196 CATARINA BELO One can envisage an indirect response when Averroes says that God's essence 'is the totality of all intellects, indeed all existents'.49 What is the meaning of this apparently mysterious statement? We must now turn to Averroes' conception of matter and its relation to the Godhead, and also to the relation between forms and matter, the union of which gives rise to individuals. Matter is the substrate in which forms inhere. It is also, in itself, pure potentiality. Now potentiality, as the opposite of actuality, is that which can possibly exist but only exists once it is actualized by an agent, an active principle. For Averroes as for Avicenna matter contains a potentiality for existing but possesses in itself no capacity for self-motion or transformation. Therefore, matter exists solely through its relation to forms, and indeed it contains in potency all forms.50 According to Averroes, 'the philosophers had seen that every sensible existent is composed of matter and form, and that the form is the entity through which the existent becomes existent'.51 In the Long Commentary on the Metaphysics he also states that prime matter, which is divested of form, does not exist outside the mind.52 This point is further pressed in the Long Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics-. [matter is] 'this thing' in so far as it is seen... The meaning of 'it is "this thing" insofar as it is seen' is: it is that the being or individual existence of which is considered from the point of view of the thing by which it becomes perceptible, namely the form, because matter is not perceptible by itself but only through something else, i. e., through the form. It has no existence save insofar as it is perceptible through something else ... Matter has existence only in relation to the existence through which it is seen, i.e., form'.53 The next step is to ascertain who or what is responsible for the combination of matter and form in any given substance. This is, as Averroes himself admits in the Long Commentary on the Metaphysics, a difficult question that had divided a number of thinkers and 49 Averroes, Tahafot, i. 202. 50 For a more comprehensive treatment of the concept of matter in Averroes see R. Ramon Guerrero, 'Sobre el concepto de materia en Averroes', in A. Martinez Lorca (ed.), Al encuentro de Averroes (Madrid: Trotta, 1993), 71-92. 51 Averroes, Tahafot, 432-3; Tahafut, i. 260. 52 Averroes, (ed. M. Bouyges), Tafsir ma ba d al-tabta (Beirut: Dar el-Machreq, 3 vols., 1973), i. 1474. 53 Ibid, 1466, 1475. Trans. C. Genequand, Long Commentary on the Metaphysics (Leiden: E.J. Brill), 94, 98.</page><page sequence="21">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 197 interpreters of Aristotle. With regard to this issue, Averroes follows the theory that seems to him the most faithful to Aristotle. Because both matter and forms are eternal—coming to be and passing a way is a result of the combination of the two—and because nothing is generated from nothing, the form is not created and applied to matter, thereby giving rise to an individual. Also, it is not applied to matter by a separate agent, totally detached from matter, for (as we have seen) only that can be actualized in any given being which this being already possesses in potentiality. Averroes is thus rejecting Avicenna's theory of the dator formarum.54 According to Averroes, the combination of matter and form is effected by an agent who turns into act the forms that are potentially in matter: 'the agent produces only the compound from matter and form by moving matter and changing it to educe the potentiality it has for the form into actuality.'55 If we consider God as the foremost efficient, formal and final cause of the universe and all it contains, we are bound to conclude that according to Averroes He is at bottom responsible for the being of each and every intellect and existent. And because His causality is wholly identified with His knowledge, this knowledge extends equally to particulars.56 How this knowledge comes about is not, and cannot be, grasped by the human mind, for it would require us to know the whole myriad of causes and effects which produce every single movement and change in the universe, i.e. it would require us to have a knowledge that is the prerogative of God. Furthermore, we cannot speak of a 'process' of knowing in God, since His knowledge occurs, as His creation, in an eternal 'now'. In rejecting Avicenna's formulation of God's knowledge, Averroes implies that there is no 'process' of acquiring knowledge in the case of God, unlike the case of humans. 54 Averroes, Tafsir ma ba'd al-tabi'a, i. 1497-8. 55 Ibid, 1499; (trans. Genequand) Long Commentary on the Metaphysics, 109. 56 Kogan, Averroes and the Metaphysics of Causation, 244: 'By His cognitional identity with the paradigms of all specific natures in their best order, God not only determines what the intelligible structures and causal relations of things can be, He also sets in motion that purely natural processes that generate particular individuals and states of affairs. All this is accomplished insofar as God is a final cause. The ultimate effects or objects of His knowledge, therefore, will inevitably be individuals, because only individuals can be meaningfully understood to seek after or move toward an end.'</page><page sequence="22">198 CATARINA BELO CONCLUSION In the foregoing I have discussed the issue of God's knowledge of particulars according to Averroes, including al-Ghazzall's criticism of Avicenna's theory. Al-Ghazzall begins by attacking the philosophers' entire conception of God as being fundamentally un-Qur'anic and un-Islamic. From that premise he proceeds to demolish their views on God's knowledge, and concludes that, according to them, God does not know Himself or any particular individual or event. The main target of al-Ghazzall's criticism was Avicenna and his contention that God knows particulars in a universal way. In his response to al-Ghazzall, Averroes' main contribution is his rejection of Avicenna's formulation that God knows particulars in a universal way. Averroes criticizes this view because it does away with the distinction between divine and human knowledge. While the process of human knowledge entails abstraction of universals from individual substances, God's knowledge cannot be characterized as universal or particular. His knowledge is neither particular because it does not involve sense experience, nor universal, because it is not abstracted knowledge. The upshot of his qualification regarding the use of 'particular' and 'universal' with reference to the 'mode' of divine knowledge is that the essence of God's knowledge is at bottom unknowable to the human mind. This position may resemble al-Ghazzall's overall negative stance concerning our understanding of God's knowledge but in actuality it is radically different. By way of stating what God's knowledge is not, and by clearly showing the differences between divine and human knowl edge, Averroes gives us a clearer grasp of what that knowledge must be like—-much in the same way that in negative theology God is conceived through negative attributes—although we cannot know exactly the nature of that knowledge. The second important aspect of Averroes' response consists in stressing that in God causality and knowledge are identical, which echoes Avicenna's own position. He explains the notion of God as cause, understood here in its fourfold dimension. Unlike human knowledge, God's knowledge is causative. Although God is efficient, final and formal cause He is not mixed with matter and hence does not perceive particulars in the way that humans do. Although Averroes does not provide a full-fledged and comprehensive solution to the fundamental problem of the connection between the intellectual and the material in the thirteenth discussion of Tahafut al-tahafut, which would helps us to understand how God knows particulars, by drawing on other works and</page><page sequence="23">AVERROES ON GOD'S KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULARS 199 taking his overall philosophical stance into account, one can conclude that a convincing response to the issue of God's knowledge of particulars is provided. This response is given indirectly and implicitly because it draws on the difference between God's and our knowledge rather than characterizing God's knowledge in a positive way. And the philosophical framework giving rise to such a reply involves not just the rejection of al-Ghazzall's view of God and how God relates to the world, but also the rejection of a number of fundamental philosophical views held by Avicenna concerning divine causation.
