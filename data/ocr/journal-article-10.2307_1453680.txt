<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRE-EXISTENT ANGEL OF THE MAGHARIANS AND AL'NAHAWANDi By H. A. WOLFSON, Harvard University THE VIEW that the world was created by a pre-existent created angel is reported in several sources in the name of a Jewish sect and in the name of the Karaite Benjamin al- Nahawandi. The earliest source is the work Kitdb al-Anwdr w'al-Mardkib by the Karaite Kirkisani. He describes a Jewish sect, which, according to him, appeared at the time the Sadducees flou- rished and before the rise of Christianity. He calls that sect Magharians (al-maghdriyyah), "cave-dwellers", explaining that they are called "cave-dwellers" because their books were found in a cave, from which it may be inferred that, according to him, that was not the original name of the sect. He mentions an author of that sect, whom he describes as "the Alexandrian", saying of him: "His book is mashhiyr macryg/, and it is the most important of the books of the Magharians, and after it there is a small booklet entitled Se/er Yaddu 'a or Yadu ca (%nrr it) ), and this is also a fine book."' I have left the two Arabic words, mashhiir ma rcy/, untranslated. Literally, mashhiir means "well- known" and macryfl means "known." Inasmuch as the Hebrew title of the "small booklet", if read Yaduca, means also "known,"2 we have reason to believe that the Arabic term 1 Anw2rI, 2, 8, p. I2, II. I-3; I, i8, 2, p. 59, i. 8 (ed.

We may thus assume that the small Hebrew Se/er Yacdua was a sort of abridgment of a larger Arabic work. What the title of the book meant will be discussed later. The views of this sect is desciibed by 1Kirkisani as follows: "Da'ud ibn Merwan [al-Mukamma.] in one of his books reports concerning the Sadducees that they anthropomorphized the Creator and took the terms implying anthropomorphism, by which Scripture describes the Creator, in their literal sense. But of the Magharians the opposite of this is reported [by him], viz., that, while they do not speak of God in anthropomorphic terms, yet they do not strip such anthropomorphic descrip- tions of God [in Scripture] of their literal sense, but they rather think that these descriptions apply to one of the angels (li-bad'i al-mald'ikati), namely, the angel who created the world."3 By this he means to say that they solve the problem of the anthropomorphic expressions not by explaining them allegorically but by ascribing them to an angel whom God created before the creation of the world and who created the world. It will be noticed that, while Kirkisani does not ex- plicitly say that it is Mukammas who reports concerning the Magharians being opposed to the Sadducees in their inter- pretation of scriptural anthropomorphism, it may be assumed that the report is taken from the same work of Mukammas from which Kirkisani has taken his report on the Sadducees and hence that they are represented by Mukammas as having already existed, probably under some other name, at the time of the Sadducees. A view similar to that reported by him of the Magharians is Yaddu'a" (cf. Neh. IO: 22; I2: II, 22). Nemoy (op. cit., p. 327, n. 26) suggests the reading Se/er Yadu'a, which he translates "The Book of the Known" used in the sense of "The Book of the Unknown." 3 Anwar, I, 7, p. 42, 11. 3-8.</page><page sequence="3">PRE-EXISTENT ANGEL-WOLFSON 9I said by IKirkisdni to be that which he will later report of Benjamin al-Nahawandi.4 As reported by him later, al- Nahawandi believed that "the Creator created only a single angel, and it is this angel who created the whole world, and it is he who sent forth the prophets and dispatched the apostles and performed the miracles and ordained the laws and pro- hibitions, and it is he who, independently of the First Creator, brings about whatsoever happens in the world." 5 In this report of the teaching of Nahawandi there is the additional element that it is that pre-existent created angel through whom the Law was revealed. There is no mention of it in his account of the Magharians. Conversely, no mention is made here by IKirkisdnl of the Magharians' explanation of the anthropomorphic ex- pressions in Scripture as referring to that angel. The descrip- tion here of God as "the First Creator" would indicate that, when Kirkisani reports in the name of Nahawandi that "the Creator created only a single angel, and it is this angel who created the whole world", he only means that directly God created only a single angel but that the whole world was created by Him indirectly through that angel.6 Parallel to these reports about a Jewish sect and Nahawandi as believing in a pre-existent angel who created the world are reports in Shahrastdni.7 In Shahrastani, the term Magharians (al-maghdriyyah) was corrupted into Makaribans (al-makdribah),8 and he uses this term, erroneouslv, to include also a Persian Jewish sect of the seventh century known as the Yudghanites (al-yudghdniyyah) but which he calls Yud'anites (al-yudcaniyyah).

T69, 1. 20.</page><page sequence="4">92 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW rians proper are described by him as follows: "One part of the Makaribans believe that God spoke to the prophets through an angel, whom He had chosen and placed above all creatures and whom He had appointed as His proxy over them"9 and that "he who addressed Moses with spoken words is that angel,"10 and that it is this angel who is spoken of as God in the anthropomorphical narratives of the Hebrew Bible." He then continues: "They say that it is ordinarily possible that God sent a certain angel from all those who attend upon Him, to confer upon him His name, and to pi oclaim: This is My apostle and his place among you is My place and his woi d and command among you is My word and command and his appearance among you is My appearance. This was the case of that angel. It is said that Arius, who states concerning the Messiah that He is God in the sense that He is the elect one of the world, has taken his views from them, who had preceded him by four hundred years."'2 In this report of Shahrastani, the created angel, like that of Kirkisani's Maghaxians, is used as an explanation of anthro- pomorphism and, like that of Kirkisani's Nahawandi, is described as he through whom the Law was revealed. No mention is made in it of his being the creator of the world. It contains, however, three additional elements: (i) that the angel, through whom the Law was revealed and to whom all the anthropomorphical narratives of the Hebrew Bible refer, could be sent down by God among men to act as His represent- ative; (2) that that angel was actually sent down by God to act as His representative among men; (3) that it is this belief of theirs that was later followed by Arius. This would seem to change the Magharians from a Jewish sect into an early Christian sect with an Ebionitic Christology, like that later adopted in Anus. 9 Ibid., p. I69, 11. 7-8. 10 Ibid., 11.

And, if we are right in assuming that the first part of Shahrastani's report was taken from Mukammas, we may also assume that the second part, that which would seem to make of the Magharians a Christian sect and forerunners of Arius, was also taken from Mukammas. This is not an unlikely assumption, for Mukammas, who was born a Jew, was for a number of years a convert to Christian- ity, during which time he is said to have studied under a Christian philosopher by the name of Nana. His interest in Christianity is attested by the fact that he wrote commentaries on Genesis and Ecclesiastes, which are based on Christian works, and also that, after his reversion of Judaism, he wrote two books against Christianity.13 However, IKirkisdnl's report, as well as the corresponding statement in the first part of Shahrastani's report, definitely describes the so-called Mag- harians as a Jewish sect. We may, therefore, assume that in the original work of Mukammas the statement corresponding to the second part of Shahrastani's report was not a continua- tion of his description of a Jewish sect in his statement cor- responding to the first part in Shahrastani's report; it was rather a description of a Christian sect which arose out of that Jewish sect. This will explain why this part was omitted by Kirkisani, whose statement dealt only with Jewish sects. Shahrastani then goes on to report: "And it is also said that a follower of this view is Benjamin al-Nahawandi, who ex- plained to them [i.e., his followers] this belief and taught them that the verses in the Torah which imply a likeness be- tween God and creatures are all subject to interpretation and '3 Anwdr, I, 8, 5.</page><page sequence="6">94 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that God is not to be described by any description used of men, that He cannot be likened to any created thing nor can any created thing be likened to Him, and that what is meant by all those expressions which occur in the Torah is that aforementioned angel.")14 In this report on Nahawandi, it will be noticed, there is an explicit mention only of that single fact which is not men- tioned by Kirkisanli, namely, that the created angel it is who is the subject of the anthropomorphical expressions in Scrip- ture. No mention is made of the two facts which are explicitly mentioned by Kirkisdnl, namely, that the created angel it is who created the world and through whom the Law was revealed. From a comparison of Kirkisani and Shahrastani we may judge that underlying both of them was the work of Mukam- mas, in which two sects were described, an earlier Jewish one and a later Christian one and that out to that work Klrkisani and Shahrastani selected what they each happened to be interested in. The story of these sects may therefore be sum- maiized as follows: At about the time the Sadducees were still flourishing, there was somewhel e a sect which held the following beliefs: (i) That an angel created by God before the creation of the world created the world. (2) That through that angel the Law was revealed. (3) That that angel is the subject of all the anthropomorphic expressions used in Scripture about God. (4) That an angel may be sent down in the form of man to represent God. (5) That subsequently the sect or some part of it came to believe that the pre-existeilt angel, who created the wofld, was actually sent down in the form of man to represent God and that Arius, about 400 years later, based his christology upon that view. We further gather that that sect, which contemporaneous with the Sadducees existed somewhele, was later to be bound in Egypt, where it flourished for some time and then dis- 14 Milal, p.

One of these books, ascribed to an author called "the Alexandrian,"' was known either to Kirkisani or to Mukammas. It existed in two versions, the original longer version written in Arabic and an abridgment of it written in Hebrew. The respective Arabic and Hebrew titles of these two versions of the book meant the same thing, "known." It is ultimately from these two vefsions of the book that was derived the knowledge of their belief as it has come down to us through the reports of Kirkisani and Shahrastani. The question naturally arises, where did the conception of such an angel come from? When that question was first raised, the answer given was that it was the Logos of Philo.16 But since, according to all accounts, the so-called Magharians existed as a Jewish sect prior to the rise of Christianity, a Philonic origin of the view of that sect is to be excluded on chronological grounds. Besides, the assumption of a Philonic source would not explain the view of the pre-existent angel as taught either by the Magharians or by Nahawandi. To begin with, the pre-existent angel of both the Magharians and Nahawandi is not only the creator of the world but he is also the God of the Old Testament who is described anthro- 15 Anwar I, i8, 2, p. 59, 1. 8. 16 Cf. Harkavy, loc. cit.; S. Poznanski, loc. cit.; Neumark, loc. cit. See Baron's critical remarks on this view (op. cit., p. 380) and his following statement: "Neither does the mere fact that the Magharians believed in an intermediary angel who created the world necessarily link them directly with the Philonic logos. The doctrine of a demiurge had been much alive in Christian, as well as in Jewish, gnosis long before it was turned into a vehicle of anti-Jewish propaganda by Marcion and Pontus." Recent attempts to identify the Magharians 'ith the Kumran sectarians were surveyed by Dr. N. Golb in a paper read at the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society, March 29, I960, in which he suggested that the Hebrew 171V7 should be read yadoca and translated "gnosis."</page><page sequence="8">96 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW pomorphically. Now Philo does not identify the Logos with the God of the Old Testament, nor does he use it as an ex- planation for its anthropomorphic description of God, though he occasionally ascribes to the Logos certain actions which in the Old Testament ale ascribed to God.17 Second, Philo never made the Logos the intermediary of the revelation of every- thing in the Law. According to him, all revelations to Moses were either (i) directly by the Divine Voice or (2) indirectly (a) through the Divine Spirit or (b) through angels.18 Third, Philo never called the Logos an angel, though he occasionally interprets the term angels in Scripture as Logoi.19 This, how- ever, should not be considered a serious objection, for the term "angel" came to be used in the literature of the time as a general description for any supramundane being. The term "the Alexandrian" by which the author of the book is de- scribed is not sufficient to identify him with Philo. Philo is not referred to in antiquity as "the Alexandrian" nor even as "Philo the Alexandrian." He is simply referred to as Philo,20 though Clement of Alexandria refers to him once as "the Pythagorean Philo'"21 and Jerome refers to him as "Philo Judaeus, a native of Alexandria".22 Nor, for the same chronological reason, can the New Testament be taken as the source of the view attributed to this sect. Besides-though, as we have said, this is not a serious objection-while in the New Testament the Pauline Wisdom and the Johannine Logos are each, as the pre- existent Christ, said to be He through whom all things were created (Col. I: i6; i Cor. 8: i6; Heb. I: 2; John I: 3) and 17 Cf., for instance, in his comment on the term "God" in Gen. 9: 6 (Quaestiones et Solutiones in Genesin II, 62) and on the term "God" in Gen. 31: 13 (De Somniis I, 31, 227-230).

It is only some Church Fathers who, following Philo, tried to show that the term angel in the Old Testament occasionally refers to the Logos, that is, to the Logos of the New Testament. Thus the "angel of the Lord" who appeared to Moses in the burning bush (Exod. 3: 2) is said by Justin Martyr to be the Logos23 and Clement of Alexandria says that in the Old Testament "the Logos was an angel",24 that is to say, in the Old Testament the term angel sometimes refers to the Logos. What is needed here is a view according to which whenever God is spoken of in Scripture, whether as Creator of the world or as a revealer of the Law or as the subject of all kinds of anthropomorphic descriptives, it is not God Himself but an angel who was created by God before the cieation of the world and, furthermore that that angel was ultimately sent down by God in the form of man. Such a view is to be found among the earliest of the Christian Gnostics which appeared before the end of the first century. The belief that the world was created not by God himself but by an angel is common to all the Gnostic systems. Similarly common to all of them is the belief that the Law was revealed by an angel. That all anthropomorphisms in Scripture refer to that angel, and not to God, though not stated by them in so many words, is implied in their common view that the God of the Old Testament is not the God the Father of the New Testa- ment, but the angel who created the world and revealed the Law. Similarly some Gnostic sects, though not all of them, followed Paul and John in identifying the Creator of the world with the pre-existent Christ who was sent down among men25 and one sect of Gnostics, the Barbelo-Gnostics, described one 23 Justin Martyr, Diologus cum Tryphone 6o. 24 Pedagogus I, 7 5 (PG 8, 32I A). 25 Cf. my Philosophy of the Church Fathers, I, pp. 508-9, 515-16, and</page><page sequence="10">98 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of their many pre-existent Christs as "the first angel".26 In fact, the description of the pre-existent Christ as an angel is the chief characteristic of one of the earliest Christian heresies, reported in the New Testament, the so-called Colossian heresy, which may be regarded as one of the earliest forms of Gnosti- cism. "These Colossian heretics," as I have said of them elsewhere, "seem to have been converts to Christianity from some form of Judaized pagan syncretism, in which the original lower pagan deities were reduced to the status of Jewish angels. Their conversion to Christianity must have taken place under the influence of Paul, from whom they had adopted the belief of a pre-existent Christ. But instead of following the teaching of Paul in its original form, they mounted it upon their own Judaized syncretism. The pre-existent Christ thus became to them only one of those many angels whom they had worshiped before they became Christians and whom they continued to worship even after they became Christians. '27 From the fact that Paul, in his exhortation to them, said: "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days" (Col. 2: i6), it mav be inferred that these heretics continued also to practise the Jewish religious laws. We may, therefore, assume that the so-called Magharian sect, like the so-called Colossian heresy, started as a Judaized syncretism, and later became Christianized. While yet a Judaized syncretism, these Magharians raised one of the many deities with which it had started to the position of one uncreated God and reduced all the other deities to the po- sition of created angels. Following their inherited pagan view that it was not the highest God, but one of the subordinate deities that created the world, they identified the God, who in sections on "God", pp. 520 ff., "Pre-existent Christ: Logos and Holy Spirit", pp. 531 ff., and "Creator", pp. 538 ff. 26 Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses I, 29, 4, and my comment on it op. Cit., p. 539, n. 49. 27 The Philosophy of the Church Fathers, I, p. 511.</page><page sequence="11">PRE-EXISTENT ANGEL-WOLFSON 99 Genesis is said to have created the world, with one of the created angels. And since in Scripture it is the God who created the world that is also said to have revealed the Law and that is also constantly described by anthropomorphic terms, they identified the God spoken of throughout Scripture with that angelic creator of the world. With the rise of Christianity that Judaized form of syncretism added to its system the belief in Ebionitic type of Christology, which in its vocabulary took the form of a statement that the pre-existent angel, who created the world, was sent down in the form of man to re- present God. The Magharians thus started as a Judaized pagan syncretism and ended up as a certain form of Gnosticism, with an Ebio- nitic Christology and probably also with an Ebionitic attitude toward the Law. With the rest of Christian Gnosticism it soon found its home in Alexandria, where, we imagine, it flourished for some time under the name of Gnostics on the outskirts of Christianity. With the elimination of Gnosticism from Christianity, the sect drifted back to Judaism, and flourished, still under the name of Gnostics, on the outskirts of that religion, so that by the time Egypt came under Muslim rule and was Arabicized the sect came to be regarded as a Jewish sect. It is during that period of the sect under Muslim rule that there appeared the books referred to by Kirkisdnl, one in Arabic, written by "the Alexandrian", and the other in Hebrew, which was only an abridgment of the former. Both these books bore the same title, which contained the words macrfi/ and yaduca respectively, literally meaning "known". Since the views of the sect, as we have seen, correspond to the views of the Gnostics, the title of the book would seem to be somehow connected with some form of a term suggesting Gnosticism. Now in Arabic the term macri/ah is technically used in the sense of mystic knowledge of God, that is, "gnosis", and the term cdrif is technically used in the sense of one possessing such mystic knowledge of God, that is,</page><page sequence="12">100 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW "gnostic".28 Similarly the term macrfi/, literally "known", is technically used in the sense of the God of the Cdrif,29, that is, the God of the gnostic. Accordingly, by retaining in the text of Kirkisani the reading macrfi/ and only slightly emending the words mashhfir macrfi/ to read mashhfir bi'l-macri7/, we may infer that the book was entitled Kitdb al-Macri4/, of which the Hebrew Se/er Yaduca, slightly emended to read Se/er ha-Yaduca, is an exact translation. The origin ot the Magharians is thus plausibly explained. That the Karaite Nahawandi should have accepted their views is to be explained by the influence of the Muslim en- vironment in which Karaism arose and by which it was in- fluenced in many other ways. As for Nahawandi's belief that the world was created through an intermediary whom he calls angel, there is Ahmad ibn Ha'it, of whom it is reported that he believed that "the world has two lords and two creators, of whom one is eternal, and He is God, and the other is created."30 The name of the second and created creator is given by him directly as being "Jesus the son of Mary,"'3' and is said to be referred to as "image" in "the tradition which has come down that God created Adam in His image (surah)."32 All this reflects Paul's statements about the pre-existent Christ, to whom he refers as "our Lord Jesus Christ" (Col. I: 3), that He is "the image (EM&amp;v) of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation" and that "by Him were all things created" (Col. I: I5, I6) and 28 Massignon, Kitab al-Tawdsin (I9I3), PP. 7, I56, I83, I94; La Passion d'AI Hallayj (I9I4-2I), p. 688; Gardet et Anawati, Introduction a la Thdologie Musulmane (I948), pp. 89, 209, n.

I: 26) as re- ferring to the pre-existent Christ,33 which must have come down to Muslims as an oral tradition. But with this Christian origin of an intermediary creator of the world there must have been joined also a Neoplatonic source, for Ibn Ha'it is also reported to have said that the first created thing was "the first intellect" (al-cakl al-awwal) or "the Active Intellect" (al-cakl al-laccdl), from which emanate the forms upon the other existing things."34 As for Nahawandi's belief that the Law was revealed by an angel, there is, besides a few stray rabbinic statements about the presence of angels at the revelation of the Law on Mount Sinai,35 the Muslim belief that the Koran was received by Muhammad through an angel.36 As for Nahawandi's explanation of scriptural anthropo- morphisms as referring to that created angel, there is an ex- planation in Shahrastani, who, after reporting on the teaching of Nahawandi, says that his view with regard to the scriptural anthropomorphism is the same "as when in the Koran going and coming is taken to refer to the coming of an angel."37 Evidently in Islam there was already the attempt to explain anthropomorphisms by attributing them to an angel. Repudiation of the conception of a pre-existent angel as the creator of the world, aimed directly at Nahawandi, is to be found in the works of both Rabbanites and Karaites. Among the Rabbanites, Saadia, in a chapter devoted to the rejection of erroneous views, refers to those who interpret 33 Cf., for instance, Clement of Alexandria, Cohortatio ad Gentes Io98-4 (PG 8, 2I2 C ff.). Cf. also Justin Martyr, Dialogus cum Tryphone 62. 34 Milal, p. 44, II. 4-5. On the still earlier influence of this view on Islam, see I.

In one place, after stating that God "creates all things by Himself, with- out any intermediary", he declares his "denial of all inter- mediaries ... and of the view of Benjamin ha-Nahawandi, who said that God created an angel and through the angel He created the world, that is to say, the heaven, the earth, man- kind, and everything else."43 In another place, he says: "If we imagine that God bestowed power upon one of the angels, enabling him to create His world, as has been asserted by Benjamin ha-Nahawandi and his like, then inevitably we 38 Emunot ve-De'ot V, 8, p. i86, II. 9-IO. 39 Cf.

Moreover, after we have shown by proof that [a body], on account of its being powerful only in virtue of power [granted to it by God], could not create bodies, it is evident that between the Creator [who is incorporeal] and ourselves there is no intermediary but that He Himself is the creator of our bodies and our life. "44 Third, there is Jeshua ben Judah, who makes a hypothetical questioner pose to him the following question: "Do you maintain that it is God Himself who created the world with- out any intermediary or do you consider it possible that God created an angel (hay) and that angel created the world ?" In answer to this he says: "Even if we had decided that we have no proof for the view that God created the world without any intermediary, the view of him who says that the creator of the world is an angel (mal'ak) would be untenable... We maintain, however, that we have a way of establishing that God is the creator of the world without any intermediary,"45 and thereupon he proceeds with his arguments. But, while he denies the pre-existence of an angel as the creator of the world, X-1 :"'7 zrvlng -m'7 .1' *88 nw-Ti mimb 1,viin vnD z3vix risp 1-mm j1Xn irx pr?X7 ng" rr1i [&amp; Cpa ocPo8toc6 £tovOv ] v=tx jvix971z3X '171' Z7j7 $'1&gt;"'1vin1": 'ID $Yrrwl 1. 1z1 vm; $.IN t7 x$w -IT$1:; MDt7 InIrl Him NI,m .INX "lm 11m 'm 13""1 1z" 7x"M 'ID rnx '-wr jn 'gr l:&gt;n' Xt7 It may be remarked that the term a&amp;xpa8Loc&amp;3oo6v does not occur in any Greek lexicon, nor does the other possible retransliteration Uvxep&amp;ocPovC'V. 45 Jeshuah be Judah, Bereshit Rabbah, p. 72a (MS.

This may be gathered from his comment on the meaning of the term be-reshit in the opening verse of the Book of Genesis. Usually this term is translated "In the beginning", but he takes it to mean "with the first", that is to say, with the angel who was the first created being, and the verse is interpreted by him to mean either that simultaneously with the creation of the angel, or immediately after the creation of the angel, God created the heaven and the earth. Both these interpretations are characterized by him as "plausible".46 The background of these two alternative interpretations is the discussion in Christianity whether angels were created prior to the creation of the world or whether they were created on the first day of creation47 and especially some such statement as that of Theodoret of Cyrrhus that the question "whether angels exist before (7rpoivc&amp;pXoua&amp;) heaven and earth or whether they were created with (a6v) them" is a useless question.48 The passage about the Sadducees and the Magharians and Nahawandi quoted in the name of Mukammas by K~irkisani is also quoted in the name of Mukammas by Judah Hadassi. It reads as follows: "David ben Merwan al-Mukammas in one of his books reports concerning the Sadducees that they at- tribute to God every human likeness by which He is desclibed in Scripture. And He also reports concerning the Magharians as being of an opposite view with regard to God, maintaining that they do not apply to God any human likeness but that, while they take any term predicated of God in Scripture in its literal sense, they explain and interpret it as applying to a wonderful being from on high, [namely, an angel]. Besides, they say that the scriptural predicates of God apply to some 46 Ibid., pp. 79b-80a: Xl:n-iii inxi wnpL . vi i8XU.nn&amp;, x in rvr, lXl:i rnsx:t3 n 'xii . vip rm, s 'sn z*iy ,n, runt nrTpmj jx'tn rim rnx' r i pli, xn 47 Cf. my Philo, I, pp. 4I8-I9. 48 Quaestiones in Genesin I, 3 (PG 8o, 8o C).</page><page sequence="17">PRE-EXISTENT ANGEL-WOLFSON I05 angels (le-miksat ha-mal'akim), and among them the angel who created the world, as has been said by Benjamin al- Nahawandi."49 This statement of Hadassi is assumed to be based in its entirety upon Kirkisdni50 and accordingly the difference be- tween the phrase "to some angels" (le-miksat ha-mal'akim) used here by Hadassi and the phrase "to one of the angels" (li-ba(di al-mala'kati) used by JKirkisdni51 has been explained as being due to Nahawandi's misunderstanding of the meaning of the Arabic phrase used by JKirkisdn!.52 This, I think, is not necessarily so. While it is to be admitted that the first part of Hadassi's statement is based upon Kirkisani, and there- fore I translated it in correspondence to Kirkisani, it is possible that the second part, that beginning with "Besides, they say" and concluding with "as has been said by Benjamin al-Naha- wandi" is based upon another souice. The existence of such another source is indicated by Hadassi's statement elsewhere that Nahawandi, in agreement with celtain Christian theolo- gians, held that on the first day of creation, when the "upper- most heaven" was created and "before the creation of any- thing else", God created "the totality of glories and angels in His world".53 Undoubtedly among this "totality of glories 49Eshkol ha-Ko/er 98, p. 4id: n11V 30 iinl 131 I'D 1U7"I -Ty= *1["]nm n&lt;risp t7m 1xvin In -Tr - :0 qfnx t inrrml -Ty=z t3 -InD1 31 :1r$ y ninDn -vowinDn &gt;nn 11DIVD ;8|D llt?X iv Slll;l TO1 1|3D 'ID 07"n zI1:2 "'woln tI;l Xt7 'ID t3l II-Tlmxl- n&lt; 5m In"InD tn;l '""11 lrl: nlttg XllL-im m~n mi"n1: 'nn 50 Anw2r, VII, p. 42, 11. 3-8; cf. above at nn. 3, 4, 5. 51 Ibid., I, I4, I, p. 55, 1. 3; cf. above at n. 5. 52 Cf.
