<plain_text><page sequence="1">124 concepts of "individual" or "interaction" for example, are in no sense less abstract and more empirical than, say, the concept of "state" or the Watson-Crick model of DNA. The idea that microphenomena are somehow "more real" or "more empirical" than macrophenomena rests on the flawed and hence abandoned logical positivist program to ground all knowledge in the absolute certainty of sensory perceptions that tell us what reality really looks like. But sheer perception does not tell us what individuals or interactions really are; just as it does not tell us what states, revolutions, or molecules really are. "Translating" our macro- into microconcepts does not give us a more empirical sociology, it just replaces one set of abstract concepts by another. Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" does not become more real if we translate the semantics of love and passion into statements about hormonal processes; instead, we would erase one language game and make the world a lot less interesting place to live in. With respect to causal explanation, I do not think that we could generally improve the explanatory power of statements such as "revolutions are caused by the disorganiza- tion of states" if we had "primary data" about opening and closing rituals in conversations (between whom?); as Collins (1981) appears to suggest. Causal explanations are attempts of making sense, making sense requires particular languages appropriate for particular purposes, and I cannot see why there should be only one language: that of microsociology into which all other languages must be translated to make our accounts more empiri- cal and causally stronger. The pragmatist theory of language and meaning (Rorty, 1979) suggests that particular language games do not differ in their capacities to mirror nature and objective reality, they only differ in their usefulness for particular descriptive and explanatory purposes. Thus, if we want to explain why particular individuals behave the way they do, we employ the semantics of reasons and intentions, but if we are inter- ested in why revolutions occur, we employ the semantics of structure, mass movements, economic change, etc. Finally, it seems to me that popular microsociological claims about macrostruc- tures forming "aggregates" of "repeated" microevents and interactions (Collins, 1981; Giddens, 1984; Knorr-Cetina and Cicourel, 1981; Alexander et al, 1987) evidence SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY rhetorical awkwardness more than a clear conception of how macrostructures can be "decomposed" into microevents. If partici- pants repeat an interaction episode, the result is repeated, possibly routinized interaction, but not a different type of social system (e.g., an organization). Repeated interaction sys- tems still employ the self-selection and boundary maintenance principles of interac- tion systems and these systems are still based on the duality of perception and communica- tion made possible by copresence. Kinship societies repeated and routinized interactions over very long periods of time, but their organizing principles nevertheless remained close to copresence typical of (extended) interaction systems. Not surprisingly, then, Collins' (1981) metaphor of "interaction ritual chains" creating macrostructures seems to capture best the extension of tribes and clans though marriage exchanges. Or, to use different words, how could one show that Wallerstein's world system "aggregates" Sche- gloff's conversational turn-taking sequences? REFERENCES Alexander, Jeffrey C. et al (eds) 1987.

INTERACTION ORDER: REPLY TO FUCHS ANNE WARFIELD RAWLS Department of Philosophy, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan In his comment on my paper "The Interaction Order Sui Generis. Goffman's Contribution to</page><page sequence="2">LETTERS Social Theory" Sociological Theory 5, 1987:136-149) Stephan Fuchs compliments what he calls my "convincing" argument for Goffman's status as a systematic theorist. However, he argues that I fail to establish the possibility of an interaction order sui generis. As Goffman's contribution to a theory of an interaction order sui generis provided the grounds for my argument that his work comprises a fairly systematic whole, I find it hard to see how Fuchs can find the one argument "convincing" while dismissing the other. He offers as a corrective to my position a theory which does not acknowledge the possibility of a self-ordered interactional domain but a limiting one (Luhmann, 1982).2 Finally, he ends his commentary by arguing against the reductionist tendency in microso- ciology. As one of my main points was to criticize the same tendency, I fail to see the relevance of these comments to my work. I will take up each of these points in turn, giving a more extended discussion of Luh- mann's position for those who are unfamiliar with it. According to Fuchs, a theory of an interaction order sui generis can only be established on the basis of an argument that interaction is "different in kind" from other sorts of social systems. The position I took was that such a "difference in kind" can be established on the basis of Goffman's notion of "working consensus" or "involvement obligations" (Rawls 1987: 142). Our differ- ences over whether I have made a successful argument for an interaction order turn on Fuchs' claim that because "rules and norma- tive commitments are also employed by ' Fuchs uses the term "emergence" to refer to interaction orders. The notion of emergence implies the possibility of variation and unpredictability amidst constraint. When I used this term in an earlier paper (1984) I did not realize that it had this connotation. I meant to convey that the constraints on the interaction order emerge from within rather than from without. I did not mean to identify a constraint-free domain however small or fleeting. When Fuchs challenges me to explain the possibility of emergent interaction order he means it in his sense not mine. 2 In Luhmann's view interaction is not self ordered but rather self limiting. That is, there are time space limitation of copresence which impose limits on the shape interaction can take (linear, one at a time etc.). These are the features of interaction which for Luhmann are irreducible to other system forms. Fuchs identifica- tion of sui generis with Luhmann's notion of irreducibil- ity does not at all adequately represent what I meant by sui generis. 125 formal organizations" they can't explain why it is useful to interpret the interaction order as a reality sui generis as I have tried to do. Although this might appear to be a picky disagreement over the status of rules and norms, the dispute is over more than the fine points of an argument. On the basis of his interpretation of "involvement obligation" as equivalent to the rules of formal organizations and his consequent dismissal of my "different in kind" argument, Fuchs concludes that I can't define the boundaries of interaction. Luhmann, he says, can clearly define those boundaries. He claims therefore, that Luh- mann's notion of interaction systems, defined by copresence, is superior to my argument. Luhmann, however, does not have a theory of an interaction order sui generis at all. He has a notion of interaction as a physical setting bounded by copresence and character- ized by opportunities to communicate. For Luhmann, "personal presence is the selection principle as well as the boundary-formation principle governing interaction systems" (Luh- mann, 1982: 71). There is no other difference in principle between interaction systems and the all encompassing social system which Luhmann calls "society" (Luhmann, 1982:73-75).3 For Luhmann meaning is pregiven and selection of a finite number of meanings from an infinite number of commu- nication possibilities is the principle function of boundary maintenance systems large and small. I see this identification of the interaction order with interaction situations as one of the main problems with most theories about interaction. Identifying the interaction system with all situations of copresence not only makes it impossible to distinguish interaction as a form of organization, but it makes it difficult to see how interaction is anything more than the instantiation of formal organi- 3 Although Luhmann might argue that complex organizations are distinguishable in so far as they have formalized goals, in his view social systems do not have this characteristic. He thinks the degree of consensus over goal and norms and their subsequent importance for explaining social order has been greatly exaggerated by thinkers like Parsons and Habermas. Therefore, society could not be distinguished from interaction systems on the basis of goals. I think it is difficult to make a distinction on the basis of formalized goals and rules even for formal organizations. The many interactions exhibit- ing formalized goals and rules, such as games, courtrooms etc., would prevent his making the distinction this way.</page><page sequence="3">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY zation in specific places and times. Formal organizations also conduct their business through situations of copresence. Identifying the interaction order with situations of copresence does not allow for a distinction between the "kind" of order characterizing the interaction order and the "kind" of order characterizing formal organizations.4 Consequently, Luhmann does not present interaction as a distinct type of order. For Luhmann interaction is a place, a physical situation. Rather than viewing interaction as being organized, which for Luhmann means having specific entry and exit requirements (Luhmann, 1982:75) he argues that sequenc- ing, turtaking, and other features of conver- sational actions are limiting conditions on what can be done in interactions. Further, he argues that these limiting conditions distin- guish situations of copresence from formal organizations and society. Rather than view- ing these practices as ordering mechanisms in a Wittgensteinian sense, he views them as hindrances to conversational exchange of a Hobbesian sort (i.e., mental dialogue in correspondence with perception). He equates the interaction order with all situations of copresence in a rather trivial and traditional sense.5 This position leaves the order of interaction to be guided and framed by systems in a manner which in my view is incompatible with an interactional perspective (Rawls, 1984, 1985, 1987). Whether one agrees with Luhmann's position on interaction or not, it in no way approaches the novelty of Goffman's idea of treating the order of interaction as framed by organizational constraints emerg- ing from within interactions rather than from external macro structures. The notion of an interaction sui generis 4 There is an irritating lack of evidence for Luhmann's arguments, and a confusing tendency toward word play. Often sweeping conclusions (e.g. that justice is an empty notion) seem more the product of semantic play than the conclusion of an argument. 5 This view of interaction as free from social constraint has fueled the notion of human freedom for many theorists. The trouble is that there are no situations which are free of expectations. If we equate freedom with such situations then we face the ultimate existential dilemma (see Rawls, 1984). But if we recognize that interaction order expectations are not "society-integrating expecta- tions" (Luhmann, 1982:79) but expectations which integrate social selves and constitutive meaning, then there is no reason to think we need to escape these in order to be free. does not identify the interaction order with interactional situations. It refers to principles of constraint having their origins in needs generated by the social self and the interac- tional achievement of meaning. The "in- volvement obligations" which I argue charac- terize the interaction order are not rules or norms. They do not crystallize over time through the routinization of actions. Rather, they are generated by the fragile nature of the social self and its dependence on interaction of a particular sort for its continued existence (Rawls 1987: 142-145). While for Goffman the human subject is at the center of the interaction order, for Luhmann "the action system is the subject of the agent" (Luhmann, 1982:50). Far from being the source of all meaning, the activity of the subject for Luhmann depends upon a system of meanings given in advance (Luh- mann, 1982:xxx). Luhmann's notion of the system as agent is quite a serious one on his part, and he criticizes theorists who place an emphasis on "subjectivity". According to Luhmann, subjectivity is an abstract term invented by philosophers which does not refer to human beings (Luhmann, 1982:324-5). The real subject of social action is the social system (Luhmann, 1982:50 &amp; 291). As a consequence of this rather unusual argument he claims that "sociological deployments of the term (subject) inevitably lapse into anthropomorphism" (Luhmann, 1982:325). Whereas to speak of systems in terms of using, wanting, choosing, etc., is considered perfectly appropriate and frequently appears in his writing. The point is that for Luhmann the idea that the needs of the social self could provide an organizational center for an interaction order is preposterous. Only systems can provide such organizational centers and what distin- guishes interaction as a system is copresence. Therefore for Luhmann copresence, not the social self, provides the organizational center for interaction (and it turns out to be not much of an organizational center at all, which is no surprise). Denying the active role played by human subjectivity both as an actor and as a set of needs constraining action handicaps Luh- mann's argument. I am not speaking of the psychological subject but rather to the so- cially constructed self as an ongoing social product whose continued integration depends upon the commitment obligations which 126</page><page sequence="4">LETTERS distinguish the interaction order. The social self as a source of commitment is one of the elements in my view which makes the interaction order different in kind and distin- guishes the interaction order from formal organizations and "society". This sort of a distinction does not identify the interaction order with interaction situations, but rather with a set of expectations generated by the vulnerability of the social self. The interac- tion order exists as a level of order even though it is always overlaid by other levels of order. The attempt to identify intimacy, gemeinschaft, essential-will, etc., with partic- ular sorts of situations has been the classical sociological mistake. As Goffman pointed out sociology must give up this way of making the distinction (Goffman, 1983:12). The interaction order is present as an organiza- tional feature of all situations. It exerts some influence on all organizations, whether formal or not, which have as Goffman says to "handle human materials" (Goffman, 1961). Luhmann's position makes the traditional assumptions that social institutions or systems provide the structure for meaningful action. What he does not offer is a theory of interaction order sui generis. The only exception to this in situations of copresence is a sort of conversation of perception which Luhmann seems to consider "pre" institu- tional or pre structure. This argument as- sumes that we have meanings given directly by perception which language constrains and that in face-to-face encounters we can directly exchange these meanings without the media- tion of social structure. In fact one of the biggest differences between Luhmann's posi- tion and my own is that he believes in the possibility of an entirely formal context independent language (Luhmann 1982: 371). Whereas I hold a more Wittgensteinian view of meaning as dependent upon social prac- tices. Hence the very large difference be- tween us over whether social practices pose a hindrance or a help to face-to-face communi- cation. Where Luhmann does appear to refer to the work of interactionists in the area of conver- sation he draws some strange conclusions from their work.6 Turntaking, for instance, he 6 In all the various comments on sequencing and turntaking found scattered throughout The Differentiation of Society, Luhmann makes no references to the scholars treats as resulting from limitations on copres- ence (cognitive and spatial limitations). He treats sequencing in a similar fashion (Luh- mann, 1982:72-73) as imposed by time space limitations of copresence, completely missing the commitment implication of conversational practices. The struggle for turns, Luhmann argues, establishes that even at this "elementary" level there exists no social system within which life chances are distributed equally" (Luhmann, 1982:70). It is because he sees meaning as being given in advance that Luhmann does not see the utility of sequenc- ing for generating meaning. Luhmann claims that sequencing does not allow the fullness of perception to be expressed and therefore claims that sequenc- ing limits communication possibilities. This understanding seems to be based on a context independent theory of meaning. Sacks' (1964-1974) conception of language and meaning is closer to Wittgenstein's notion of language games, a view which denies the possibility of "private" or referential mean- ing. In Sacks' view, sequencing and the coop- eration which it requires are part of the "cement" which holds interactions together. Because sequencing is a crucial feature of language games, it generates demands which interactants are expected to fulfill. Within a correspondence or reference theory of mean- ing this sort of social cooperation is not necessary. But within a Wittgensteinian theory of meaning it makes good sense to view things like sequencing as adding to, rather than subtracting from the communica- tive possibilities of the situation. In fact, there have been some rather convincing arguments by interactionists that the conversation of gesture which Luhmann considers to be pre-linguistic and thereby unstructured, is itself characterized by a rather rigid adherence to sequencing (Goodwin, 1981). For Luhmann, copresence is essentially limiting although he is willing to allow only that in these settings because we can see one another we can sometimes escape the bond- age of institutionalized communication sys- tems though a "prelinguistic" exchange. This does not even begin to capture the importance placed on interaction as an order generating whose work on turntaking and sequencing he is obviously referring to (Sacks, Scheloff, and Jefferson, 1974). 127</page><page sequence="5">128 setting by Goffman, Garfinkel, Sacks, Sche- gloff, and Jefferson. Luhmann says the constraints of face-to-face interaction can't be escaped except by ascending to systems of another type. I would agree with him on this. But, to my way of thinking this is not an escape from constraint, it is an escape to constraints of an arbitrary and institutional origin (Luhmann, 1982:73). Because copresence is considered to be the defining feature of interactional systems the physical aspects of perception become ger- mane. Luhmann and Fuchs agree with Gidden's view that "face and body are important in encounters" because the body has its own language which can only be spoken in interactional systems utilizing sensory perceptions (Fuchs, 1988). Luhmann does worse than reduce interaction to institu- tional systems. He reduces it to the trivial features of particular physical contexts of copresence. Giddens also treats the physical interaction and its boundaries as the goal to be protected (see Rawls, 1987). Whereas for Goffman the social self is the good which places constraints on the interaction order and defines its boundaries. It is important to note that the social self does not define the boundaries of interaction (i.e. define when we are copresent etc.). Therefore, if we define interaction systems in terms of copresence, as Luhmann and Gid- dens have, the self will not be at the center. What the social self defines is an order of interactional expectations which must be fulfilled in order to sustain that self (and conceiving of meaning in terms of language games allows meaning to play the same role). The difference between these expectations and the rules and norms of formal systems is that they are not defined by the organizational needs of systems. They are defined by the human needs of self. It was this obvious focus on the social self as the central constraint on social order which first attracted me to Goffman's work. I think it has quite far reaching implications. Fuchs ends his "comment" with an argu- ment against the reductionist tendencies of micro sociology. I find it hard to understand why he does this as one of the implications of the theory of interaction order as I presented it in my paper is that macro structures can not be reduced to micro structures, and I clearly argued against reductionist tendencies in both directions. Like many of his other comments, SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY this seems not to be addressed to my paper, but rather to some ongoing argument with someone else. While I agree in criticizing reductionist tendencies, I sharply disagree with the conclusion Fuchs draws from this that micro sociologists' claims for the importance of interactional data are based on logical positiv- ist beliefs in the privileged reality of such data. The argument is really quite simple. If one is operating on the assumption that the interaction order is different in kind from other sorts of order, then data derived from or generated by macro structures will not reveal the nature of the interaction order. Interac- tional data are not important because they are more "real" but rather because the interaction order is distinct and cannot be revealed by other levels of order. While I disagree with those microsociologists who would reduce macro structures to interactions, I also disagree with Fuchs who makes this irreduc- ibility the basis for claiming the interactional data are not better, or more important than macro data. I would argue that for revealing interaction order phenomena, interactional data are better because macro data does not reveal this level of order at all. I would also argue that since society is composed of both macro and micro levels to proceed without the micro level produces a very skewed view of social order. Even a study focused exclu- sively on "macro" organization will go wrong if it does not integrate studies of the interaction order, because the interaction order exerts a powerful internal influence on macro structures.7 We search our macro organizations for explanations of phenomena which only have explanations at the level of interaction order and consequently the total picture is falsified.
