<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EDITED BY CLEMENT W. MEIGHAN GENERAL One measure of the growth of scientific archaeology in the New World may be seen in the number of publica- tions appearing each year. The very rapid expansion of archaeological reporting can be seen clearly in the increas- ing work of compiling "Some Recent Publications" which appears in this number. This annual compilation is made by the assistant editors who also prepare Notes and News; hence a brief history of "Some Recent Publications" is appropriate here. In Volume 1 of this journal, only 27 publications in American archaeology were reported (these, of course, are in addition to what appeared in AMERICAN ANTIQUITY itself). The number of annual publications remained small until 1942, when there was a considerable jump which persisted through World War II. Following the war, there was another big increase to the present level, which has listed more than 400 titles each year since 1948. This year's total of 695 titles is the all-time high. These figures represent a better than 10-fold increase in archaeological titles in only 12 years, a remarkable record in view of the continuing small number of profes- sional archaeologists in the New World. Considering that only a thousand or so scholars have been pub- lishing their results at the rate of more than one paper a day for the past 10 years, perhaps the oft-heard lamen- tation about slow publication is not entirely justified. At least, archaeologists are probably as good at reporting their research as scholars in other disciplines. Along with increase in publication has gone a corres- ponding difficulty in keeping up with the research results in one's field of interest. In the early volumes of this journal, the assistant editors could list all the publications for their region out of their heads. Today, these editors must devote considerable effort to maintaining a bibli- ography; even so, they occasionally miss articles of some significance. A few of the titles reported this time date back as far as 1953, and they are just now getting reported in our pages. Members of the S.A.A. can ensure prompt listing of their own research efforts by sending titles or reprints to their assistant editor. Since many papers are now published in local journals that may not come to the attention of the regional editors, such cooperation has become almost essential if our annual bibliography is to be complete. ARCTIC The following are delayed reports of 1956 fieldwork. ALASKA. Gordon H. Marsh, of the University of Alaska, conducted 2 brief reconnaissance trips. The first was an investigation of a gravel spit at Alexandrovsk on English Bay, near the mouth of Cook Inlet, where the proposed building of an airstrip threatened to destroy a site. His survey revealed a row of rectangular house pits which appear to mark a relatively brief period of postcontact settlement. Possibly older portions of the site will not be disturbed by the airstrip, and may be returned to later. Marsh's other survey was carried out in the vicinity of Manley Hot Springs on the Lower Tanana River. A de- posit of animal bones here, some of them representing an extinct form of bison, was test-pitted, but no signs of human occupation were detected. John M. Campbell, of Yale University,' discovered a new site on the west bank of Contact Creek, high up in Anaktuvuk Pass in the Brooks Range. The site area con- sisted of several concentrations of artifacts along a quarter- mile stretch of the creek, and unstratified material was recovered from the uppermost 12 inches of soil cover. A single hearth was the only unusual feature noted. The most characteristic artifact type is a large, lanceolate projectile point or blade, most examples of which have a convex base and show fine parallel, oblique flaking on one or both surfaces. Quite large end scrapers are also numerous in his collection. Aside from these, Campbell comments on the extraordinary number of large chert spalls found at the site. There was no trace at all of pot- tery, ground or polished stone, slate, microliths, or poly- hedral cores. Thus far, the material in general does not seem to fit any of the complexes which have been de- scribed for the American Arctic. SOUTHAMPTON ISLAND. From June through August of 1956, William E. Taylor, of the Canadian Museum of Human History, together with Charles H. McNutt, Mu- seum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, worked at Native Point for the purpose of completing the pro- gram begun and directed there by Henry B. Collins dur- ing 1954 and 1955. The previous concentration had been on Dorset and proto-Dorset sites in the area, so the 1956 season was devoted primarily to the village site where the last of the Sadlermiut Eskimos died in 1903. In addi- tion to the collection of artifacts and human skeletal material, a specific study was made of Sadlermiut archi- tecture as exemplified in the 90 house ruins in the site. These are characterized by ground-level floors, storage alcoves which flank the entrance passage, as well as a uniquely massive construction of walls and interior stor- age compartments. Sadlermiut cultural origins are still a matter of question, but, most recently, Collins has sug- gested that here was initially a Dorset culture which was later overlaid by heavy Thule influences. The following projects are on the Arctic docket for the summer of 1957: John M. Campbell, supported by a grant from the Arctic Institute of North America, will return for 2 months of excavation and further reconnaissance at the Contact Creek site in Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska. T. H. Manning and A. H. Macpherson plan to be working on King William Island and Adelaide Peninsula for the Canadian Museum of Natural History. They will 97</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY be interested mainly in birds and mammals, but will also carry out exploratory archaeology as the occasion arises. Jorgen Meldgaard, of the Danish National Museum, goes to Pond Inlet, northern Baffin Island, in July, and hopes also to revisit Igloolik, on Melville Peninsula, in order to supplement his 1954 operation there with new data. William E. Taylor expects to investigate some house ruins that have been reported at Payne Lake in the in- terior of Ungava Peninsula. He will survey the immediate area, and if time permits he also plans to reconnoiter portions of the west coast of Ungava Bay. Richard S. MacNeish, of the Canadian Museum of Human History, will be operating in the southern Yukon Territory, in the area between Whitehorse and Dawson. He will be assisted in the field by 2 Canadian students now attending the University of Michigan, Mark Molot and Reginald Hamel. Assembled by ELMER HARP, JR. WEST COAST AND GREAT BASIN BRITISH COLUMBIA. Under the direction of Charles Borden, and supported by funds from the University of British Coluimbia Committee on Research, students of an anthropology class on British Columbia prehistory and members of the University Archaeology Club have been engaged since October, 1956, in excavating the accumu- lated house floor deposits inside one of the 2 remaining old houses of a recent Coast Salish village on the Mus- queam Indian Reserve, Vancouver, B.C. The total depth of the deposit is more than 51/2 feet, the uppermost 12 to 14 inches being within the historic horizon. The finds (more than 10 artifacts per cubic yard) are adding signi- ficantly to our knowledge of the late period in the Fraser Delta sequence. WASHINGTON. Excavations in the Ice Harbor Reservoir on the lower Snake River are being conducted by Richard D. Daugherty of the State College of Washington under a grant from the National Park Service. The area is one of considerable interest from the standpoint of determin- ing cultural relationships between the prehistoric inhabi- tants of the Columbia and Snake River valleys. Douglas Osborne of the University of Washington announces that field work will continue in The Dalles Reservoir area until the flooding takes place. An agree- ment with the Oregon Archaeological Society will permit excavations to continue at the Wakemap Mound. A group of interested Portland and Vancouver people have developed a technique for taking casts of petroglyphs, and assisted by Robert Butler of the University of Wash- ington, are taking impressions of the more spectacular petroglyphs before these are inundated by the rising waters. Students in physical anthropology, under the direction of Frederick Hulse, are studying the skeletal material from The Dalles excavations. The Chinook tribe has requested that a student archae- ologist be assigned to their area where they will support excavations. The National Park Service reports that Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington, will spend $40,000 over the next 3 years to support archaeological excavations in the Priest Rapids and Wanapum reservoir areas on the Columbia River. With the assistance of students from Western Wash- ington College of Education, Herbert C. Taylor, Jr. will conduct an archaeological survey of the upper Skagit, Ross Lake, and Lake Chelan areas of northern Washing- ton late in August. Taylor and Angelo Anastasio are spending part of the summer in excavating a stratified midden, probably a Semiahmoo site, on the south coast of the Gulf of Georgia. OREGON. Continuing work begun last summer, a field party from the University of Oregon is spending the sum- mer excavating in the Tillamook area under the direction of Luther Cressman. Cressman announces that the report on the excava- tions carried out in The Dalles Reservoir, on the Oregon side of the river, is being prepared for publication and should be ready for the press in the fall. Plans call for the publication of the results of the various field projects, carried on from 1952-56, in a single Imonograph rather than in a series of papers scattered through different journals. It is felt that this will give a more significant picture of the cultural developments in the area and facilitate use of the results by interested persons. Under the direction of Roy L. Carlson, Curator, the Klamath County Museum plans to conduct excavations at a site on Lower Klamath Lake this summer. CALIFORNIA. R. F. Heizer reports that the University of California Archaeological Survey has completed a short reconnaissance of an area in the foothills of the Northern Sierra Nevada. The purpose of the survey was to locate sites from which evidence of proto-Maidu occu- pation might be recovered, with the ultimate goal of determining, if possible, relationships between the pre- historic people of this area and those who occupied the Yana territory to the northwest. Several open sites and a series of dry-deposit rock shelters were recorded; enough archaeological material may be expected from the excava- tion of the latter to provide a firm foundation for com- parison of the 2 regions. A report by M. A. Baumhoff, analyzing material recovered in 1956 from Payne's Cave, in Yana territory, is now in press. This report supple- ments findings made by Baumhoff from nearby Kingsley Cave, thus adding to our knowledge of foothill Yana and perhaps Maidu prehistory. A survey of the Prosser Creek and Stampede Valley districts, north of Lake Tahoe in California, is planned for the late summer of 1957. Work will be done in coopera- tion with the National Park Service. The results of the survey will be integrated with information already ob- tained regarding the Martis complex of the region. Any sites recommended for excavation will be reported to the Park Service, in anticipation of proposed destruction or inundation by Federal dam projects. Several sites in the Trinity River power project region are scheduled for excavation by the University of California, Berkeley, in 98 [ XXIII, 1, 1957</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS cooperation with the National Park Service and San Francisco State College. The sites were surveyed by A. E. Treganza in 1952, in connection with the River Basin program of salvage archaeology. A. B. Elsasser and E. Contreras have been engaged in a continuing project involving a resurvey of some of the more specticular petroglyphs of California. Pictographs of Tulare County have been chosen as those most in need of complete recording by color photography and scale drawings before the originals are destroyed or irreparably altered by vandals. J. Werlhof and J. Vierhus of the Cali- fornia School of Fine Arts, San Francisco, have been co- operating in the project. M. A. Baumhoff, G. L. Grosscup, and R. J. Squier have been acting successively as E. H. Harriman Fund research assistants at the University of California, Berkeley. The purpose of the assistantships has been to put on record the unpublished ethnogeographic work of C. Hart Mer- riam, by means of organizing part of the Merriam collec- tion of manuscripts, maps, and notes, and at the same time relating them to the work of other ethnographers or archaeologists in certain selected regions. Results have proved valuable in the clarification of problems con- cerning hitherto doubtful geographical borders and in providing stimulus for more exact location of recorded and unrecorded archaeological sites in California and Nevada. Students of Sacramento State College have been en- gaged in salvage excavations in the Monticello Reservoir area west of Winters, California, under contract with the National Park Service through the Sacramento State College Foundation, with Richard Reeve, Brigham Ar- nold, and Norman Wilson in charge. Sacramento State College will include an archaeological field school in the High Sierras, north of Lake Tahoe, as part of the sufmmer session curriculum. A class of 15 students from the University of Southern California will carry on investigations of several sites at Cameo Cove near Laguna Beach. Some preliminary work was done here last summer by the University of Southern California. The sites are in a location soon to be devel- oped for a housing subdivision. Alice Hunt, collaborator with the Department of Anthropology, University of Southern California, has resumed her field work in Death Valley. Her work during last winter was mostly on gravel terraces overlooking Death Valley (sea level to 1500 feet altitude). Of greatest interest was her discovery of 2 (possibly 3) habitation sites with Lake Mohave type projectile points and accom- panying tool assemblages. These represent the earliest authentic evidences of human occupation yet discovered in Death Valley. John C. Tyler, formerly with the Museum of Anthro- pology, University of California at Berkeley, has joined the staff of the Department of Geology and Anthropology of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History as Preparator. UTAH. James H. Gunnerson spent the winter months writing a report of his last 2 seasons of work in the Fre- mont area. His study includes extensive microscopic analysis of pottery carried on during the past 15 months. The department at Utah is much encouraged by the growth of the Utah Statewide Archeological Society. This organization has published 2 volumes (of 4 numbers each) of a newsletter, Utah Archeology, in 1955 and 1956, at department expense. This support was withdrawn as of December 1956 and a membership charge initiated. Interest was sufficient that by March 1957 membership totaled more than 50. One local chapter at Moab has been organized, and it is hoped that continuing growth can be reported. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. Paul Schumacher, National Park Service Archeologist, resumed excavations at Fort Clatsop during the spring. Of particular importance was a imore definite determination of the location of the Lewis and Clark fort used during the winter of 1805-06. Flooding in the Monticello Reservoir, brought on by heavy winter rains, caused difficulty in salvaging the re- maining archaeological sites. Sacramento State College and the National Park Service are cooperating in the excavation program which is under the direction of Richard N. Reeve of Sacramento State College. Working nearly every weekend during the winter and spring, 3 sites were excavated and 2 more were tested. The Bishop Museum, under contract with Hawaii National Park, is doing an intensive study of the City of Refuge National Historic Park. The archaeological work is under the direction of Kenneth P. Emory. Botanical, ethnological, physical geographic, historical, and marine reef and shore fauna studies are being carried on in con- junction with the project. Asembled by RICHARD D. DAUGHERTY SOUTHWEST ARIZONA. An announcement of the recent opening of the new University of Arizona Geochronology Labora- tories is furnished by Terah L. Smiley. The laboratories are housed in buildings originally constructed and used by the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. They have been made available to the Uni- versity through the cooperation of the Rocky Mountain Range and Forest Experiment Station, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Financial assistance for the purchase of equipment was made possible through the Rockefeller Foundation. A new pollen analysis laboratory and a vertebrate paleontology laboratory are located in the buildings. A geochemistry laboratory and a radioactive dating laboratory are planned for the near future. An academic program in geochronology has been established within the Graduate College of the University. A Master of Science degree and a minor subject for doctoral candi- dates in related fields is now offered to qualified students. Interested persons may obtain information from the Director, Geochronology Laboratories, or the Graduate College, University of Arizona, Tucson. William Wasley has prepared an 8-page description of "The Archaeological Survey of the Arizona State Mu- 99</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY seum." It contains a map with the survey grid for Arizona and adjacent areas superimposed, a reproduction of the site card form, an explanation of the method of site designation, and a description of the storage of survey collections. Copies are available for distribution to inter- ested students and professionals from Wasley at the Arizona State Museum, Tucson. Raymond H. Thompson is directing the University of Arizona's 12th annual archaeological field school at Point of Pines, San Carlos Indian Reservation. Charles Di Peso reports that the Amerind Foundation has completed the excavation of the Reeve Ruin, near Redington, and that the report on this excavation is being prepared. Currently a field party, directed by Rex Gerald, has been able to define a western immigration into the San Pedro river valley which occurred during the Ootam Reassertion Period (A.D. 1300-1700). This intrusion is marked by a number of site units which extend as far south as Cascabel in the San Pedro drainage. Stone masonry, subterranean kivas, Gila-Tucson polychrome pottery tradition, a northern lithic complex, and a Pueb- loid settlement pattern are diagnostic of this particular intrusion, and indicate that it was definitely different from the culture of the indigenous people living in the valley at a comparable time period. The Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff, cooper- ating with the National Park Service, will excavate one or more pre-eruptive sites at Sunset Crater National Monument. Several pit houses will be roofed over and preserved as exhibits for the public. Paul S. Martin and John Rinaldo, of the Chicago Museum of Natural History, expect to resume archaeo- logical work in the area of the upper Little Colorado and between Showlow and Springerville. A new camp head- quarters has been established at Vernon, Arizona. Southwestern National Monuments headquarters at Globe, Arizona, is being changed from an administrative headquarters to a technical headquarters. Details regard- ing the reorganization are not available at this time, but it is likely that the archaeological preservation laboratory and at least a part of the stabilization unit will be located at Globe. The majority of the personnel stationed there will be moved to other areas in the National Park Service system. This year's Pecos Conference is scheduled to be held at the National Park Service facilities at Globe, August 26-28. NEW MEXICO. Frank C. Hibben has selected 3 sites for the University of New Mexico field session this summer. A third season will be spent at Pottery Mound, near Los Lunas, New Mexico. The outstanding feature of this site is the discovery of 4 kivas with remarkably intact painted walls. Two of these kivas have been excavated, revealing a series of most interesting paintings. It will also be New Mexico's third season at the early man site near Lucy, New Mexico. The Lucy site contains Sandia, Clovis Fluted, Classic Folsom, Pinto, and possibly some other types of material. This season's excavations will concentrate on working out stratification and relationships of the various kinds of materials. Additional excavations in the Gallina area will be carried on at a site on the western periphery near Starve Out Ridge. With the com- pletion of this excavation it is contemplated that the final report on the Gallina area will be possible. Numerous activities are reported from Santa Fe. Bertha Dutton and Agnes Sims, of the Museum of New Mexico, are working on a projected publication of the Kuaua (AM. ANTIQ. Vol. 13, No. 3, pp. 218-23, 1948) murals, with view to reproducing the layers of paintings along with text figures and brief notes. The Senior Girl Scout archaeological mobile camps will be directed for the 11th year by Bertha Dutton. Stewart Peckham and Edward Dittert, of the Museum of New Mexico's Depart- ment of Highway Salvage Archaeology, have excavated 6 sites on various highway construction projects. These include a small Tularosa phase site near Reserve; a por- tion of a historic Zuni site near Ramah; a White Mound phase pit house 20 miles west of Albuquerque, and 3 sites near the Ambrosia Lake uranium fields northwest of Grants. The latter 3 sites represent a cultural sequence ranging from about A.D. 850 to 1100, and contained both pithouses and surface masonry walled structures. Texas Technological College, Lubbock, is planning a longrange project of historical and archaeological research near Taos, New Mexico. Fred Wendorf will be its direc- tor. This summer the primary efforts will be in excavating a pre-Civil War U.S. Army post located 10 miles south of Taos at Pot Creek. Restoration of the fort is contem- plated so that it will serve as a field school headquarters in future years, and eventually become a museum. COLORADO. Joe Ben Wheat, of the University of Col- orado Museum, will continue excavations at the Yellow Jacket site in southwestern Colorado. The University of Colorado's radioactive dating laboratory has developed to the point of running samples for calibration purposes. NORTHERN MEXICO. Richard Brooks, of the University of California, has recorded over 1500 archaeological sites in south central Chihuahua and northern Durango, Mexi- co, and plans to continue his survey until the middle of the summer. When completed, this research should add to our ideas of Southwestern-Mexican connections in north central Mexico. UPPER COLORADO RIVER PROJECT. Several institutions will assist in salvage archaeology projects in connection with the Upper Colorado River reclamation program. The National Park Service has contracts with the Mu- seum of Northern Arizona and the Museum of New Mexico, and a contract is pending with the University of Utah. The Museum of Northern Arizona will survey the main Glen Canyon. Gene Foster will complete this sum- mer the survey of Glen Canyon she began 2 years ago. William C. Miller, an associate of the museum, and David Breternitz, Curator of Anthropology, will work that por- tion of Navajo Canyon which is to be flooded by waters impounded behind the Glen Canyon dam. In the late summer the museum plans to have a party in the lower San Juan, which also will be flooded by the Glen Canyon 100 [ XXIII, 1, 1957</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS lake. The Museum of New Mexico has started a survey of the construction area of the Navajo Dam on the San Juan River north of Blanco, New Mexico. The University of Utah has carried out preliminary negotiations for a contract to recover data from the Glen Canyon-Flaming Gorge reservoirs. Assembled by ROBERT H. LISTER PLAINS ALBERTA. At the Glenbow Foundation in Calgary, Jack D. Herbert has been appointed Executive Director suc- ceeding Douglas Leechman who has retired. The Glen- bow Headquarters at Hull House is being made over to provide adequate facilities for historical, archaeological, and related research. Richard G. Forbis joined the staff as Archaeologist on May 1 and will spend the year exam- ining collections, surveying sites, and in general continu- ing on a full-time basis the work done under Glenbow auspices during the past 2 summers by Wormington, Mulloy, and Davis. SASKATCHEWAN. Archaeological activity is increasing in Saskatchewan. The first major report on an excavation in the province, Wettlaufer's report on the Mortlach site, appeared recently. R. W. Nero, Assistant Director of the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History in Regina (a part of the Conservation Branch of the Department of Natural Resources), reports that the museum plans to increase its archaeological program. Storage facilities and a study room for archaeology and ethnology are currently being set up. In the summer of 1957 a survey will be made along a 15-mile stretch of the valley of Long Creek in southeastern Saskatchewan, which will be flooded fol- lowing the erection of a dam in the summer of 1958. If a significant site is found, excavation is planned. Mean- while, examination and recording of sites as a general activity is being increased. The museum expects shortly to publish the results of a small test excavation made in 1956 in a hearth site 11 feet deep in a river bank in southeastern Saskatchewan. NORTH DAKOTA. At the State Historical Society in Bis- marck a report on the 1954 excavations at Kipp's Post, a trading post occupied about 1826-30, is expected to be published this year. Also soon to appear is the report on the 1955 work at the Paul Brave site, 32SI4, an "Archaic Mandan" site similar to the Thomas Riggs site in central South Dakota, but different enough to preclude assign- ment to the same focus. The report on the 1956 work at the Demery site, 39C01, is in preparation. This is the northernmost site known to have straight-rimmed pottery with horizontally incised rims ("Category B"), and it differs from similar sites farther south in certain impor- tant respects. The 4 houses excavated at Demery are circular and have 4 center posts, but a total absence of wall postholes implies a method of roofing the housees quite different from that used in the circular earth lodges of the historic Arikara and Mandan. Ceramics indicate relationships with sites of the La Roche and other South Dakota complexes, as well as showing some local deriva- tion from "Archaic Mandan." There are no trade goods, and the site is estimated to date from about A.D. 1550 to 1650. W. Raymond Wood left the Historical Society staff in March to take a position with the University of Missouri, and Alan R. Woolworth is planning to leave about May 1. Accordingly, plans for future field work by the Historical Society are indefinite. SOUTH DAKOTA. The big effort on the plains, this year as in past years, is on the mainstem of the Missouri, where the Oahe Reservoir area and, immediately downstream, the Big Bend Reservoir area constitute the only secticn of the Middle Missouri where there is still time for sal- vage work. In Oahe, 4 field parties from the Lincoln office of the Smithsonian Institution-River Basin Surveys will be at work. Waldo R. Wedel will excavate at the Black Widow site near the Fort Bennet area in Stanley County, and will test nearby sites. Robert L. Stephenson will put in a second season at the Sully site in Sully County. Two other parties will be testing and mapping sites on both sides of the river in the Oahe area. Also in Oahe will be a field party sponsored jointly by the Uni- versity of South Dakota Museum, the South Dakota Archeological Commission, and the National Park Serv- ice. This party, under Wesley R. Hurt, will work at the Rosa site in Potter County, a large historic site with many metal artifacts. It may be one of the villages visited by Lewis and Clark above the Arikara village at the mouth of the Cheyenne. In the Big Bend Reservoir, the Smithsonian expects to have 4 field parties at work. G. Hubert Smith will carry on test excavations south of Pierre at the historic sites of Fort George and Fort Bouis-Defiance as well as at 39- HU15, an unusual historic site of unknown affiliation. Warren W. Caldwell will be working at a village site and burial mound on the west bank near Fort Thompson. Robert W. Neuman will be working in 3 La Roche-like sites on the east bank near Fort Thompson. Harold Huscher is expected to be test-excavating and mapping about 14 different sites between Fort Thompson and the Big Bend. Oldemar Blasi, Professor of Geography and History, Colegio Estadual, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil, has received a grant from the State Department to study Plains archaeology for 8 months at the University of South Dakota Museum. WYOMING. David Gebhard of the Roswell, New Mexi- co, Museum will again take a field party into western and southwestern Wyoming, under the sponsorship of the Museum and the Western Foundation, Inc. Work at Torrey Lake in the upper Wind River Valley will be continued, and a survey will be made of the Sweetwater Rocks and Rattlesnake Mountain. The latter survey will be looking for evidences of the extension of Northwestern Plains Middle horizon cultures into the more southern areas of the state. KANSAS. During May and June a Smithsonian Institu- tion-River Basin Surveys field party worked in the Tor- 101</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY onto Reservoir area of southeastern Kansas, following pre- liminary work last fall by Alfred Johnson. Roscoe Wilmeth, formerly at the University of South Dakota Museum, joined the staff of the Kansas State Historical Society as Assistant Museum Director at the end of January. He reports that the Museum, while pri- marily oriented toward history, hopes to get an archae- ological program launched before long. OKLAHOMA. Robert E. Bell reports that this summer he will be taking out the eighth summer field session in archaeology for the University of Oklahoma. Plans are not complete at this writing, but the field school will be doing salvage work probably in the Oolagah and/or Keystone Reservoir areas, both of which are relatively unknown archaeologically. James B. Shaeffer, Director of the Oklahoma Archaeological Salvage Project, has sur- veyed a number of highway projects, and in early March was occupied with salvage operations near Muskogee. TEXAS. The main field work of the University of Texas is currently in the Caddoan area of East Texas, part of the Southeast rather than the Plains. However, the Uni- versity's summer field course in archaeology will be work- ing in central Texas, in and around Austin, under E. Mott Davis, and reservoir survey work in central Texas is also being contemplated. Assembled by E. MOTT DAVIS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ILLINOIS. Encouraging progress is reported by the Illi- nois Archaeological Survey; Elaine Bluhm has been com- piling and coordinating site data, with the cooperation of many institutions and individuals. The Survey is housed at the University of Illinois, and both the Illinois State Museum and Southern Illinois University are collaborat- ing on the project. The Highway Salvage Program spon- sored by the Survey is rapidly developing to a point of critical urgency. The state plans to spend more than 200 million dollars on construction this year, some of which goes through known site areas. The highway department is cooperating fully and excavation will soon begin, as far as funds permit. For the first summer in several years the University of Illinois will not have a summer dig, but plans are already being made for work in the Southwest next sum- mer in cooperation with the Museum of Northern Ari- zona. The Midwestern Archaeological Conference held last fall at Urbana was so successful that a second conference is to be held next fall at Beloit. A report of the fall meeting, a brief outline of one of the discussions involv- ing general culture stages in this area, and an announce- ment of the next meeting have been distributed. MISSOURI. The salvage program in the Table Rock Reservoir area is being continued this season, the final opportunity for work in this area since the dam is nearing completion and the water will begin to rise this fall. Two field parties are now working in the area, one under the direction of Carl H. Chapman, the other of Richard A. Marshall. A new dam, to be built on the Pomme de Terre River, will require the transfer of the salvage operations to this new reservoir area. As a preliminary step, W. Raymond Wood, recently added to the staff of the University of Missouri as an Associate in Archaeological Research, has begun a survey of the area. When the Table Rock salvage is completed he will be joined by a field crew for excavation and additional testing of the most significant sites. In the fall, when the work in the Table Rock area has been completed, Marshall will concentrate on the archae- ological survey of areas slated for highway construction. This is part of the over-all program of highway salvage being initiated by the University of Missouri in coopera- tion with the Missouri Highway Department. J. Mett Shippee conducted an archaeological survey of Laclede County in south central Missouri and resumed excavation of Research Cave in Callaway County. Char- coal samples from this site, now being analyzed by the Radiocarbon Laboratory at the University of Michigan, should be of considerable value in correlating the site with Graham Cave. The Eleventh Field Session in Midwestern Archae- ology at the University of Missouri will again be held in Ste. Genevieve County, on the Mississippi River about 65 miles south of St. Louis. Several salt pan sites will be excavated in addition to extensive testing of Mississippi and Woodland village sites in the area. INDIANA. From June 17 to August 10 Indiana Univer- sity will conduct its Archaeological Field School, under the direction of Glenn A. Black. As in the past, excava- tion and study will be carried on at the Angel Mounds site, with support from the Indiana Historical Society. Assembled by MELVIN L. FOWLER NORTHEAST DELAWARE. George E. Jackson, Corresponding Secre- tary of the Archaeological Society of Delaware, reports that, "On March 13, 1955, under the sponsorship of the Delaware Archaeological Board, the Archaeological Asso- ciation and the Archaeological Society of Delaware met to discuss a site survey of a statewide scope. With the rapid development of industrial and housing projects in Delaware, it is felt that it is important that these sites be mapped and described for future reference without delay." The Society is to conduct a survey of New Castle County and part of Kent County. The Sussex Association will cover the remainder of Kent County and all of Sussex County. The Sussex Association has virtually completed their portion of the survey. Completed re- ports of these surveys will be sent to the state archives. NEW JERSEY. The New Jersey State Museum planned to recheck the sites of the Delaware River drainage area in June, bringing data up to date for the flood control work. Ronald J. Mason will direct this work. 102 [ XXIII, 1, 1957</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS NEW YORK. The New York State Museum and Science Service will inaugurate an intensive 2 or 3 year study of the development of aboriginal settlement patterns and their socio-economic correlates in the Northeast during 1957. Work was to begin on July 1 on an early prehistoric Mohawk Iroquois village site in the middle 'Mohawk Valley, with a party of seven under the direction of William A. Ritchie, who has received an $8800 grant-in- aid for this project from the National Science Foundation. Alfred K. Guthe and Marian E. White will continue the Rochester Museum's investigation of the Morrow site, near Honeoye, New York. This multicomponent site, to be destroyed by a building development, has already yielded information regarding a Point Peninsula 2 (Middle Woodland I) cemetery. The nature of the Late Woodland and Historic components will be explored this summer with the aid of the Lewis H. Morgan Chapter of the New York State Archaeological Association. In the Greater New York City area, Julius Lopez re- ports that the third season's work on the Pelham Boulder site, Bronx County, is underway. The 1957 program also includes the photographing and study of museum mate- rials from the coast and collections presently on loan from Harry Trowbridge and George Younkheere (Schurz site material), Roy Latham (Ryder's Pond site, Kings County) and Ralph Solecki's collections including key component materials of the North Beach and Clearview foci, Windsor aspect. Participating in these activities will be Stanley Wisniewski, Timothy O'Leary, Julius Kiosi, Edward Kaeser, and Leonard Cohan. The need for such correlative efforts is becoming increasingly ap- parent in New York State and vicinity due to the quan- tity of materials already above the ground but not always known by all workers in the field. PENNSYLVANIA. During February, 1957, several mem- bers of the Lower Susquehanna Chapter of the Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology and W. Fred Kinsey, Pennsyl- vania State Museum, excavated the Harry Heck Rock Shelter in Adams County. Flint tempered, interior and exterior cord-marked pottery and other materials indi- cate that the major occupation of this shelter was during the Early Woodland or incipient Middle Woodland period. During the summer, Kinsey plans to spend most of his time surveying and testing on the Lower Susque- hanna River islands. Meanwhile, the Lower Susquehanna Chapter plans to uncover the floor plan of a second long- house at the Leibhardt site in York County. A Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, field party under the direction of Don W. Dragoo will conduct a survey and excavation program in the Beaver Valley of western Pennsylvania during the summer of 1957, concentrating on several early Archaic sites located along the shores of old glacial lakes. Two of these sites have also produced materials of the paleo-Indian period. ONTARIO. The 1956 season was one of considerable activity by the Royal Ontario Museum, the University of Toronto, the National Museum of Canada, the University of Western Ontario, and members of the Ontario Archae- ological Society. The Royal Ontario Museum continued to supervise the excavation of the Serpent Mounds on the north shore of Rice Lake near Peterborough, Ontario, during 1956. Several hundred square feet of earth were excavated near the eastern end of "The Serpent." Kenneth E. Kidd states that, "It is as yet much too soon to decide upon the cultural attribution of the site. There are indications that the mounds are Hopewellian, . . . but they may be attributable to a similar but hitherto unknown mani- festation." Work on this site will be continued during the 1957 season. The Royal Ontario Museum will also have a party, under James V. Wright, excavating a site in Bruce County during 1957. The site is located in a newly established Provincial Park and is believed to contain Laurentian (Late Archaic), Point Peninsula (Middle Woodland), and early Iroquois material. Walter A. Kenyon, of the Royal Ontario Museum, reports that 2 Iroquoian ossuaries judged to date from around 1250 were investigated on Tabor's Hill last year. This hill is a short distance east of Toronto in the town- ship of Scarborough, Ontario. The first ossuary was encountered in August, 1956, by a steam shovel removing dirt from the hill. The larger of the two was 13.5 feet in diameter and 30 inches in depth; the smaller was 9 feet in diameter and 18 inches in depth. An estimated 472 individuals were represented by the skeletal remains. According to Kenyon, "Distribution of the bones showed that not cadavers, but disarticulated skeletons had been interred. Most of these were thrown in randomly, with no attempt to keep the bones of one particular individual together. Scattered throughout this maze of bone, how- ever, was the occasional bundle burial; and 2 or 3 small pockets of burned bone suggest that cremation was also practiced. In a few of the skulls, the nasal passages and sinuses were packed with sand- evidence of an earlier burial, prior to their final interment in the heavy clay of Tabor's Hill." Additional work on these is planned by the Royal Ontario Museum. A village site, believed to have been associated with these ossuaries, was excavated in October, 1956, by Uni- versity of Toronto students under J. Norman Emerson's direction. Emerson reports, "the excavation of this site helps make clearer the pattern of prehistoric Iroquois development in Ontario. It would appear that early development began in southwestern Ontario in the area of London and St. Thomas and spread eastward about A.D. 1100. Some of these people stayed to become the Neutral tribe of the historic 1600's. Others apparently moved to the Metropolitan Toronto area and developed a pattern of migrating up the major river valley such as the Humber, the Don, Highland Creek, and the Rouge. As the centuries passed and villages were gradually moved northward these people became the Hurons of the his- toric 1600's. Thus the village of Scarborough may be described as either 'proto-Neutral' or perhaps 'proto- Huron.' It appears to have existed at a time when Iro- quois tribalism may not as yet have come into being." Evidence of structures was sought, but no longhouse remains were observed. 103</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In addition to the work on the village site in Scar- borough, Emerson directed the excavation of the Ault Park site, on Sheek Island along the St. Lawrence Seaway. This is a Point Peninsula site which has been jointly excavated by the National Museum of Canada and the University of Toronto. The burials were cremations ac- companied by grave offerings of blades, copper, and dogs. Occupational refuse has been recovered from other areas of the site and postmolds provide information on house structures of the Middle Woodland period. Emerson says, "It is still an open problem as to whether these remains represent long term occupation or whether they are just the periodic accumulation which accompanied visits to the Long Sault for burial rites." 1957 will see additional work accomplished at this site. Thomas E. Lee, National Museum of Canada, carried out several projects during the 1956 field season. These included examination of sites east of the Saguenay River, a survey up the Saguenay and around Lake St. John, investigations near Montreal and extensive work in the Ottawa Valley. However, his major work was the examination of a large earthwork near Sarnia, Ontario. In 1950, Lee had tested the site and determined that it was not the historic mission of St. Francis and that Neutrals did not build it. The oval earthwork encloses an area extending along a low ridge. This ridge separates the beginnings of 2 stream beds. A section of one of these is enclosed by the earthwork. It appears that the fort was abandoned before completion. Cultural material is scarce, but a study of the pottery indicates that the predominant types can be associated with the Iroquoian materials of the Whittlesey Focus of Ohio. Some connection is also indicated with the Lalonde Focus and Neutral material from the prehistoric Lawson Site near London, Ontario. Lee also reports, "Several hundreds of well-preserved Indian cornhills were found and charted within the earth- work. These cover the entire enclosure and were in use after the fort was otherwise abandoned. They do not exceed 6 inches in height, are about 30 inches in dia- meter, are spaced roughly on 5-foot centers, and tend to lie in rows which may curve or wander irregularly." Wilfrid Jury, University of Western Ontario, con- ducted excavations at the Forget Site near Midland, Ontario. This is a palisaded, prehistoric village. He also examined the Jesuit Mission site of Kahnawake located on the south side of the St. Lawrence River opposite Montreal. This was occupied between 1696 and 1719 and is on land soon to disappear with the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway Project. It was possible for him to trace the foundations of a church, the Jesuit residence, and several smaller homes. Parts of a palisade were also discovered. The work on this site was sponsored by the Jesuits of Lower Canada. A small site of Point Peninsula occupation (the NRU Site) was investigated by Clyde Kennedy with the assis- tance of Thomas E. Lee during 1956. This is located along the Ottawa River about 5 miles east of the town of Chalk River. It is on the property of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. Pottery types found here have been identified as: Vinette Complex Dentate, St. Lawrence Pseudo-Scallop Shell, Point Peninsula Corded, and Point Peninsula Rocker-Stamped. Additional material includes chipped flint, steatite, and bone objects. Pottery in stratified layers has been located by Frank Ridley near the mouth of the Michipicoten River, north of Lake Superior. This work was accomplished with the assistance of the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Canada. Ridley reports that the pottery represents wares of Southern Ontario, Pennsylvania, and the West- ern Plains. This site may be of considerable significance in terms of cultural movements. The Ontario Archaeological Society continued to work on the Robb Site in the Rouge River area near Markham, Ontario. This is a prehistoric Iroquoian village site which may yield information on settlement patterns. This group also located 20 sites in the Rouge River drainage basin through the continuation of the site survey project. Assembled by ALFRED K. GUTHE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA. The annual meeting of the Florida Anthro- pological Society was held at Rollins College February 3. The program included a number of contributed papers and a symposium on anthropological research in Florida, moderated by Charles Fairbanks. Participants included J. M. Goggin, Julian Granberry, William Sturtevant, and Irving Rouse. Florida State University field school was excavating at the San Luis Mission site in the spring. Investigations were centered on the fortifications and the main gate, from which the main lock bolt has been found. GEORGIA. Joseph Caldwell, for the Georgia Historical Commission and River Basin Surveys, has been excavating the mound at the historic Cherokee site of Tugalo. A number of construction stages have been defined, ranging in time from Etowah III to historic Cherokee periods. A nearby buried midden deposit dates back to Swift Creek times. One of the later stages of mound building was a log-covered flat-topped mound with a structure on its summit. VIRGINIA. John L. Cotter reports that the Jamestown 350th Anniversary celebrbation opened at Colonial Na- tional Historical Park April 1. Both Jamestown and Yorktown now constitute demonstrations of how archae- ological techniques can be employed to produce otherwise unrecorded and unobtainable data from historic sites. At Jamestown half a million objects representing almost all phases of daily life and activities, commodities, industries, and foreign imports, are now available for study. Data on 141 structures have been summarized. At Yorktown, reports on the discoveries of the key Redoubt No. 10 and various features investigated since 1934 are available to students of the Revolutionary period. A series of pamph- let studies on both areas and special articles in profes- sional journals is appearing in 1957. TEXAS. In the Caddoan area of northeastern Texas, a University of Texas field party directed by E. Mott Davis, cooperating with the National Park Service, carried on 104 [ XXIII, 1, 1957</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS 10 weeks of salvage archaeology starting in January. Work this spring was devoted to the area of the minimum pool in the Ferrels Bridge Reservoir, centering on the Whelan site, a Fulton aspect site with pottery most closely resem- bling that of the Titus and Frankston foci. Four mounds and a part of the village area were investigated. WASHINGTON, D.C. Archaeology with indoor plumb- ing was numbered among the delights of our nation's capitol this past winter. Limited excavations were made at the Old Stone House in the Old Georgetown area. This is the oldest surviving building in the district, built in 1766, and it is being restored by the National Park Service. Working with the architects, G. Hubert Smith cleared and excavated 2 ground floor rooms, a kitchen, and another room used as a shop. Among the additions to knowledge of the physical history of the building was the discovery, beneath the modern floor, of a small brick oven or industrial furnace. Artifacts obtained illustrate many aspects of building use, both industrial and com- mercial. Among the artifacts was some printer's type, evidence for a use of the structure not previously known despite exhaustive study of documentary sources on the building. Assembled by W. H. SEARS LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. Peter Paul Hilbert of the Museu Paraense "Emilio Goeldi" continues his archaeological investiga- tions in the middle Amazon region. In the fall of 1956, he visited Itacoatiara and made 2 stratigraphic excava- tions in habitation refuse that produced large quantities of sherds. Decoration included fine incision, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic applique, red on white painting, and broad line incision. Analysis of these strata cuts should give some indication of the temporal relationships between the various decorative techniques. Hilbert also visited the cemetery site at Miracanguera, first described at the end of the 19th century by Barbosa Rodrigues. He reports that the annual erosion by the river during the rainy season has almost completely washed the site away. ECUADOR. During November and December of 1956, Betty J. Meggers and Clifford Evans, both of the Division of Archeology, U.S. National Museum, conducted survey and excavations on the Rio Napo, in the eastern lowlands of Ecuador. This area was selected because of the pos- sibility that it might shed some light on the origins of the Marajoara mound culture, which is intrusive on Maraj6 Island at the mouth of the Amazon. Comparative analysis of the distribution of Marajoara traits suggested the strongest affiliations were with the northwestern part of South America and the Rio Napo seemed by its size and location to be a potential route of movement. The region surveyed was between the headwaters and the junction of the Rio Aguarico at the present Eucador-Peru border. Extensive habitation sites were found along the river banks where the elevation was sufficient to remain above flood level in the rainy season, but the sherd refuse deposits were very shallow indicating a brief period of habitation. The pottery complex includes a number of decorative techniques also characteristic of early Marajo- ara ceramics: excision on plain and red slipped surfaces, white paint in excisions, incision on white slip with red retouch, red on white and polychrome (black and red on white) painting. Vessel shapes and excised design motifs also resemble early Marajoara styles. Certain distinctive Marajoara traits such as tangas are absent in the Rio Napo complex, but in view of the distance separating the 2 areas, discrepancies are to be expected. The Rio Napo was not the place of origin of the Marajoara culture, how- ever. The sites indicate that a large group of people with well-developed ceramics moved into the area, remained a short time and then left. Except for this large influx, the area appears to have been only sporadically inhabited by pottery making cultures. PERU. The American Museum of Natural History has made a preliminary announcement of the results of the first systematic archaeological excavations in the Mon- tafia area of Peru, carried out for the museum under direction of the late Harry Tschopik by Donlad Lathrap of Harvard University. Most of his excavations were in the Shipibo village of Yarinacocha on the Ucayali River, a major tributary of the Amazon. Here he discovered pottery and occupational debris indicating that the area had a long history and widespread connections with other parts of South America. Ceramic similarities with Forma- tive cultures to the west and north occur at the bottom of the stratigraphic sequence, followed by indications of possible relationships with the culture of the Marajo region and with Venezuela and the Caribbean. Modern Shipibo pottery, occurring at the top of the deposit, ap- pears to be quite recent in date. Assembled by BETTY J. MEGGERS HIGHLAND SOUTH AMERICA CHILE. The Departamento de Extension Cultural of the University of Santiago de Chile last year invited Oswald Menghin, of the University of Buenos Aires, for a series of lectures and excavations. One of the excava- tions made during his stay was of a cave floor in the region of Concepcion, which yielded evidence of succes- sive occupation by Araucanian groups, of which 3 hori- zons were recognized-2 prehistoric and one historic. Upon invitation by local archaeological societies, Men- ghin also visited the museums of Angol and La Serena, as well as several archaeological sites in that vicinity. The Museo Arqueologico of La Serena conducted a detailed survey of the Copiap6 Valley in its entire exten- sion from the highlands to the littoral. On the coast itself, several sites near Guanaqueros and Cruz Grande were excavated, and in the neighboring district of Ovalle the sites of Tuqui and Punitaqui were explored. COLOMBIA. Julio C6sar Cubillos of the University of Popayan supervised a group of students of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia during the excavation of a recently discovered site at Bosa, near Bogota. Several 105</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY test trenches revealed a shallow deposit of pottery frag- ments of late Chibcha style. In January, Gerardo and Alicia Reichel-Dolmatoff of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia conducted excavations on the upper Sinui River, where many sites were located near Tierra Alta and Tucura. Several cuts in house middens yielded a large amount of pottery frag- ments and lithic artifacts, some of which seem to carry on a Late Formative tradition. During the month of February they surveyed the hitherto unexplored San Jorge drainage, east of the Sinul. Near Ayapel a Formative period site closely related to Momil was discovered. In the swampy region between Ayap6l and San Marcos more than a hundred house-platform mounds were located, bordering the lagoons and channels for miles. Although the mound structure and the associated gold work show close parallels with the Betanci complex of the Sinui area, the pottery of the San Jorge mounds seems to repre- sent a different tradition. ECUADOR. Fieldwork continued early this year in the coastal area of Guayaquil where Clifford Evans and Betty J. Meggers of the U.S. National Museum, in collaboration with Emilio Estrada, made several additional cuts at the Valdivia site. Nearby, several new sites of Bushnell's Guangala culture were discovered, and toward the south- ern coast a number of sites of the Manenio culture were excavated. The first Mesa Redonda on Ecuadorian archaeology was held on February 7th in the conference rooms of the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana, N6cleo del Guayas, in Guayaquil. The conference was organized by Carlos Zevallos Menendez, president of this branch of the Casa de la Cultura. The following prepared papers were de- livered in the morning session: Pedro Armillas, archaeologist on a UNESCO mission to preserve and protect the archaeological monuments of Ecuador, spoke on the broad theoretical problems of in- terrelationships between Mesoamerica and Andean South America in terms of waves of diffusion, migration, and local specializations after an initial common relationship. Francisco Huerta Rendon, University of Guayaquil, gave an illustrated talk on pottery neckrests from Ecua- dor. These are restricted to the Ecuadorian coastal prov- inces with some 14 examples now known. They were apparently used for sleeping to protect elaborate hair arrangements which are so well shown on the modeled figurines. Olaf Holm discussed the problem of identification of the game Atahualpa played with the Spaniards, and concluded that it was an aboriginal game, rather than chess as has been suggested. Clifford Evans, Division of Archeology, U.S. National Museum, spoke on the Formative periods of Chorrera and Tejar in the Guayas Province of Ecuador, showing the various traits in these 2 Ecuadorian periods that are common to the Formative horizons of Mesoamerica and Peru, and suggesting a north-to-south movement of this early culture. Emilio Estrada, Museo Arquelogica "Victor Emilio Estrada," discussed the later periods, called Quevedo and Milagro, characterized by local Ecuadorian ceramic styles, metallurgy, and artificial mounds, and the earliest ceramic culture, the Valdivia, which is closely affiliated to Tlatilco in Mexico and the Guafiape Period in Peru. Betty J. Meggers, U.S. National Museum, presented evidence from recent field work that pottery of the Napo River has many resemblances to that of the Marajoara at the mouth of the Amazon, indicating that the Marajoara culture has its antecedents in the northwest part of South America. Carlos Zevallos Menendez, president of the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana, Nucleo del Guayas, presented a paper on the possibility of marine navigation with balsa rafts and other aboriginal boats between Mesoamerica and Ecuador indicating that such craft might have been used not only as a means of migration, but also for establishing aboriginal trade routes. Matthew W. Stirling, Bureau of American Ethnology, commented on the importance of a better knowledge of Ecuadorian archaeology for the clarification or solution of many problems of North West South American cultural origins and relationships. The afternoon session was devoted to discussions and clarification of various points mentioned in the morning, and a summary of the interrelationships between Meso- america and South America during the Formative period. PERU. Frederic Engel, assisted by Edward Lanning of the University of California, reports the discovery of a new group of some 10 preceramic and premaize sites at Rio Seco on the Central Coast, 87 km. north of Lima. Subterranean architecture and artificial mounds charac- terize these sites, as well as large quantities of twined tex- tiles. Bone and wood implements were found, but stone artifacts were rare, except for one basalt point of a hith- erto unknown type. Edward Lanning located a prece- ramic cemetery on the north flank of the Asia River, 102 km. south of Lima. Ten burials associated with twined and decorated textiles, many wood and bone artifacts, and 2 stone mortars were found. This is the second pre- ceramic cemetery discovered by Engel and his associates in the coastal area, the first being near Huarmey, on the North Coast. Fossil remains of Late Pleistocene fauna were discov- ered recently in the coastal ranges between Pisco and Ica, in the lower Ica and Nazca Valleys. Dr. Vellard, of the Institut Francais d'Etudes Andines, is at present studying these finds, and has been able to bring one complete mastodon skeleton to Lima. No association with human remains or artifacts has been observed so far. Assembled by G. REICHEL-DOLMATOFF 106 [ XXIII, 1, 1957</page></plain_text>
