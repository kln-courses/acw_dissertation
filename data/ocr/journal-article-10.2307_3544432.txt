Plant demography and ecological theory. - Oikos 35: 244-253. The meanings of 'theory' in ecology are examined and illustrated with six examples from plant ecology. The application of demographic theory to plants (and other modular organisms) depends on recognition of two levels of populational organisation - the genet (N) and the modular unit of structure (ri). Examples are given to illustrate the theory that a plant is a population of parts that are born and die and the ways in which such theory can be applied to field studies. J. L.

I found myself uncertain about the precise meaning of 'theory' and as appropriate, en- quired within the Oxford English Dictionary for a meaning. With much delight I discovered "Theory. A body of theors sent by a state to perform some religious rite or duty; a solemn legation". In turn a 'theor' is defined as an ambassador or envoy sent on behalf of a state, especially to consult an oracle or perform a religi- ous rite. Sadly, this definition which so nicely describes an international symposium of scientists is described as 'Greek Antique'. More modern meanings include 'Mental view or contemplation; a systematic statement of rule or principles to be followed; a scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of phenomena'. 'A hypothesis proposed as an explanation.' Among the various colours and shades of meaning that are given, the one I like best is "That department of an art or technical subject which consists in the knowledge or statement of the facts on which it depends, or of its principles or methods as distinct from the practice of it". The practice of ecology is clear and well defined - it is what ecologists do. The many journals of ecological sci- ence record what ecologists have done - this is the de- scription of the practice. These same publications also make it possible to discover the methods used by ecologists - at least at the level of techniques and technologies. It is very much more difficult to detect the rules, principles, schemes, systems of ideas and hypotheses that would constitute the theory of the sci- ence. My own attempt to do this is encapsulated in just two principles: (1) The numbers and distribution of living organisms are determined by their potential rates of increase, the resources available for consumption, the physical factors of the environment and the interactions be- tween the organisms themselves. (2) Living organisms are the product of an evolutio- nary process and the source of present and continuing evolution. The present distribution and numbers of organisms reflect these evolved and evolving specialisations. I suggest that virtually all of what passes for ecology today can be traced to an acceptance of these principles - either as self-evident truths or as hypotheses for test- ing. Most (perhaps all) ecological theories, hypotheses or principles represent sub-sets of these two major prin- ciples; it is at this level of sub-sets that theories and principles become precise enough to involve discussion, argument and controversy - this is the level at which 'schemes or systems of ideas' often become associated with individuals. My own background and training make me particularly aware of the role of theory in plant ecology - though the more fundamental the theory the more likely it is to be biological rather than purely botanical or zoological. I choose six theories that illustrate controversy, explicit or sometimes only im- plicit. (1) A community of organisms in nature is an organised whole which is more than the sum of the indi- vidual components and their interactions. Such a 'sys- tematic statement' represents in its most extreme form a 'holist' vision and is commonly associated with F. E. Clements' view of a community as an organism (Cle- ments 1916). (Clements' vision changed profoundly during his life and it should not be forgotten that he was responsible with colleagues for some very simple early experiments with highly simplified reductionist 'model' systems of single species (Clements et al. 1929)). Ex- treme holist theory is probably tenable only as a religion and not a science - its tenets are probably untestable but it does represent a continuing philosophy in some ecologists' attitude to nature (perhaps particularly strongly developed among conservationalists). In a gentle form it says that the complexity of nature is so great that breaking it down into parts does not improve our understanding. This attitude leaves the ecological scientist with his rightful role only as describer of com- munities or systems, content with establishing correla- tions between vegetations and features of the physical environment. The anti-holist view, the individualistic approach, is usually associated with the name of Gleason. His attitude to vegetation is that of the ex- treme reductionist, focussing enquiry not on wholes, not on systems, but on the germination, growth and de- velopment of individual plants. A clear parallel to these two opposing theories of vegetation is found in present discussions and arguments about group or individual selection. (2) An ecological theory is innate in the view that communities in nature can be classified - that they rep- resent distinct 'noda', with or without 'type specimens', appropriate for pigeonholing and a taxonomy. An al- ternative theory holds that communities intergrade, that classification hides the reality of vegetational continua. In this case theory may act to squeeze or constrain observations of nature so that they conform with some predetermined vision or system of ideas. (3) Among the rules or principles to be followed by ecologists (and which therefore constitute part of its theory) are traditions affecting the levels of causation that are accepted as explaining or accounting for groups of phenomena. Pulsatilla vulgaris is found on calcareous grasslands - this is a correlative relationship, it conveys a high level of predictability and is in a sense a causal relationship. Such a correlation contributes one anec- dote to the general theory that the distribution of organisms is related to their physical environment. The correlation can be pressed further - accounting for the distribution not just in terms of calcareous grasslands, but more precisely in terms of the nutrient and water relations that characterise the calcareous grasslands that OIKOS 35:2 (1980) 245</page><page sequence="3">support this species. We may, still by correlation, estab- lish that Pulsatilla vulgaris is found in places with a specific range of pH, iron and phosphate availability. There is, however, an alternative theoretical and practi- cal approach to such a problem of distribution, known as perturbation analysis. Its analogy in physical sciences is when we say that to 'understand' or 'explain' what holds a pendulum at rest we must disturb or perturb it. When, and only when it begins to swing can we begin to understand what brings it to rest. The same argument can be made about the distribution of Pulsatilla vulgaris - only when we look to see what happens to it when we sow or transplant it in other environments will we begin to 'understand' what restricts it to the places where it grows naturally. Conventional 'explanation' of an ecological phenomenon (such as the distribution and abundance of Pulsatilla vulgaris) commonly relies on showing just how the behaviour of the organism is "exactly right" to enable us to account for its distribution. After examina- tion of the whole gamut of a species' behaviour (form, germination characteristics, drought resistance, accep- tability to herbivores or whatever other features are in the special expertise or predilections of the observer) it can usually be concluded that the species behaves in a way that is exactly right to account for where we find it. This approach (which reveals an underlying theory or attitude of mind) may be called "Panglossian ecology". Its aim is to show that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds; to confirm the theory that the be- haviour of organisms is appropriate for the places in which we know that they live. It is almost unheard of to disturb the pendulum - to ask what happens to this plant when it is introduced where it is not naturally found: does it then persist and, if not, what has gone wrong. There are two sides to the theory that organisms are suited to their environments: (a) what is it about them that fits them to those habitats, (b) what hinders their living elsewhere? The second part of that question requires perturbation analysis and is exceedingly rare in plant ecology. A comparable question concerns not just the presence or absence of a species from a community but how common or rare it is. This sort of question would (on the pendulum analogy) be appropriately answered by deliberately making the species commoner or rare in experimental areas - we might then see what forces operated to bring a return to the previous level of abundance - or perhaps discover that the previous state was not stable. The assumption (really a theory) that organisms are peculiarly fitted to the environment in which they are found can lead to a type of ecological study made to confirm rather than to test the assumption. Often, de- pending on the special expertise of the investigator, a particular aspect of the environment of the plant is chosen for study (drought, low pH, low temperature, soil nutrient status, etc.). Experiments are then made under controlled conditions from which 'extraneous' variables, other than the one chosen for study, are re- moved. Against such a background of environmental silence even the most trivial plant responses stand out as highly significant. It can be argued that the ecologist should be concerned to test the effects of treatments or conditions against the background of full environmental noise - what emerges as significant against this background is what really matters. It is seldom clear how an investigator of a problem in plant distribution decides which factors of the environ- ment are worth investigating (other than those in which he happens to have been trained and specialized). There may be a case for key factor analysis (see e.g. Varley and Gradwell 1960) as a means of isolating what really matters to a plant in the field. I suspect that (as in ani- mal ecology) for this we shall need information about birth rates and the causes of death of plants and plant parts in the field. (4) Ecological theory is concerned with a scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of phenomena. Different levels of theory and explanation prove attractive or convincing to different people. David Lack (1947) drew the distinc- tion (first made by J. R. Baker 1938) between proximal and ultimate causes in biology. If we make a proximal explanation of the distribution of a plant (e.g. Linnaea borealis), this will be in terms of its present distribution, the physiological characteristics of its members and the tolerance of present phenotypes of this species to a range of environmental conditions. 'Ultimate' explana- tion of this same species distribution is in evolutionary terms - i.e. what aspects of the evolution of ancestral populations of Linnaea borealis have left descendants behaving with the specialised behaviour and tolerances that we now find. If, as I suggest at the start of this paper, it is part of ecological theory that the present distribution and numbers of organisms reflect their past evolutionary history, we must seek in ecological practice to answer questions about genetics and evolution. G. E. Hutchinson (1965) makes this point with characteristic elegance when he writes about "The ecological theater and the evolutionary play". If our ecological theory is based on evolutionary concepts, we should reasonably expect to see an evolutionary dimension in the present practice of the science.* (5) Ecological theory tends to assume that com- munities and species assemblages found in nature are ordered (even if not organised) and that it remains for the ecologist to discover that order and explain it. It is rare for the underlying order to be questioned in the way that underlying order in the process of evolution * I suggest that this does not mean just calling all aspects of an organisms behaviour 'adaptive'. Use of this word (like 'adaptation') rarely implies more than 'What, at a reasona- ble guess, is probably the result of natural selection'. For many ecologists, saying that an organism is 'adapted' to its special environment means only that it lives there. 246 OIKOS 35: 2 (1980)</page><page sequence="4">has been questioned by the 'neutralists'. How often are distributions of species and their abundances the result of chance events - not yet caught up in the remorseless forces of order such as succession? Without doubt, chance occurrences in evolutionary history have had profound influences on local faunas and floras - the presence of Eucalypts and marsupials in Australia is the result of chance forces of geographic isolation; much of the annual flora of Britain is the result of chance forces (like Roman invasions) bringing new species to the is- land; the formation of the English Channel represented a 'chance' force that left Britain with an impoverished flora. In a discussion about ecological theory it is worth asking how far we take the ordered nature of vegetation as an accepted truth - needing more ecological neut- ralists (e.g. Hubbell 1980) to set up the null hypothesis that the composition of floras and faunas does not differ from random expectation (a resurrection of Gleasonian scepticism). (6) A very special part of ecological theory is exemplified by a strong undercurrent of the Interna- tional Biological Programme - this is the view that natural communities can be interpreted as ecological systems (perhaps a modern form of Clements' organism) which have functions and processes which can be interpreted as the activities of an area of land - production, nutrient cycling and, in extreme form, evolving ecosystems. There is a curious confusion that creeps into this type of theorising in which man's con- cern as a manager of land (farmer, forester) becomes confused with the ecologist's concern to explain nature. For the manager of land his concern is naturally with areas - what they receive as light and rainfall, what they cycle or receive as mineral resources and what they pro- duce as livestock or crops. The anthropomorphic twist that this gives to ecological theory is to elevate man's own concern as manager of acres or hectares to an ecological concern with the way such an area of land behaves. This is quite logical in the context of man- management. It is, however, extremely questionable whether any of the factors that concern organisms in nature operate on area scales. The organisms that we know today are here because their ancestors proved their fitness, i.e. left descendants. I question whether the activity of any ecosystem per hectare or per square meter has ever influenced the fitness of any organism (though fitness considerations affecting individuals may have had secondary consequences affecting perfor- mance per unit area). It we accept current evolutionary theory which is about how individual organisms leave descendants (or how individual genes leave descendant genes) it seems inescapable that both proximal and ul- timate ecological interpretation must also be at the level of individuals. Interpretations at a community level or per unit area of land must then inevitably be secondary - removed from the primary level of cause and effect. This is not to say that ecology operating at this level may not be predictive (even accurately so) but that the depth of understanding involved must be superficial. Demographic theory in plant ecology The remainder of this paper is concerned with the role of plant demography in ecological theory; it is not necessarily to be seen as an alternative or a 'better' theory than those already discussed but, when applied to plants, represents an unconventional system or scheme of ideas. Demography gives ecology a different viewing glass through which to look at nature - biassed and distorting like others - but making some new reve- lations. Perhaps most important, plant demography provides an effective common ground for meeting be- tween the students of animals and plants, and some common context in which discussion can take place between ecologists and students of population genetics and evolution. The theory of demography applied to ecology is the view that communities of organisms are populations (i.e. they can be counted) and that their behaviour can be accounted for at least in part as the consequences of births and deaths. The behaviour of a population is a statistical summary of the comings and goings of indi- viduals (which may include immigrations and emigra- tions). Thus the fundamental law of population biology is: N,+, = N, + Births - Deaths + Immigrants - Emigrants The law can be written for genetic individuals or for genes. For most animals there is no ambiguity about which are the individuals that we count as members of a population - the zygote develops to a unitary construc- tion with a defined life cycle. The mature Drosophila has two wings, six legs, two eyes and one thorax; there is similar determinism of form in a rabbit, a blue tit or a man. Hence a count of the numbers of organisms can give a rather precise description of the population - blurred only by the presence of age and sex classes of individuals within it. A demography designed for populations of men and women and suitable for a pre- dictive ecology of mankind (e.g. in the hands of insur- ance actuaries) adapts easily for the study of other higher animals. The simple modelling of population growth in ways suitable for such unitary animals, rep- resents an important part of ecological theory de- veloped early in the papers of Verhulst (1844, 1846) and much later applied to mixed populations of com- peting species and to relationships between predators and prey in the work of Lotka (1925) and Volterra (1926, 1931). Recent developments of this form of de- mographic theory (which has interacted with and greatly stimulated field observations and experiments) are nicely reviewed by May (1976). This type of demographic theory is quite unsuitable GIKOS 35: 2 (1980) 247</page><page sequence="5">for the student of higher plants and of modular animals (hydroids, corals, bryozoans, colonial ascidians, etc.). In such organisms the zygote develops by repeated itera- tions of structure - a basic unit of construction (of ar- chitecture) forms a module that is continually re-ex- pressed. The module in the higher plant may be recog- nised at a variety of levels, the leaf with axillary bud, the root with lateral branch, the fern frond, the shoot of a perennial herb. In every case the module can be recog- nised as a unit that has a characteristic time of birth and of death and a discrete length of life of its own. Moreover, the modules represent units that can be counted and form 'populations' in their own right. The modular units may gain independent existence if inter- connections are broken, as in the multiplying fronds of Lemna or in clones of white clover in which the stolons decay and leave separate parts of a single genet inde- pendently meandering through and exploiting the re- sources of a grassland community. Similarly, in modular animals, the population of modules may develop and remain physically and/or organically connected as in corals, colonial ascidians and colonial hydroids or be- come fragmented so that the product of a single zygote (the genetic individual or genet) is represented by inde- pendently migrating and even competing modules, as in Hydra. In many such modular organisms, unlike unitary animals, there is no recognisable phenomenon of senes- cence of the genet (apart from an increasing risk of death that may result from becoming enormous as in a tree or a much branched coral); new meristems on an old genet are as young as new meristems on a young one. A consequence of looking at plants and modular ani- mals in this way is that demographic methods may ap- propriately be applied to the process of growth of the products of a single zygote. The size of a clover plant at time t+l is its size at time t plus the new modular units (stolons and leaves and roots) added minus the modular units lost in the specified time interval. Growth in such organisms is itself a demographic process. Any effective theory of plant demography (or a demography of mod- ular animals) must take into account the two levels at which populational phenomena occur. We need, there- fore, symbols that distinguish between the two distinct levels at which a population can be counted and at which we can recognise processes of birth and death. We retain the symbol N (from its use in Lotka-Volterra and similar demographic models for populations of higher animals) for the genet or product of a zygote and introduce the symbol r for the module that is iterated in development from a zygote. Two levels of demographic process are then represented by: Nt+l = Nt + Births - Deaths + Immigrants - Emigrants (i. e. population dynamics at the genet level) and jt+] = mt + Births of modules - Deaths of modules The two processes contribute to the growth rate of a whole population which becomes dN/dt dq/dt. In some species modular growth continues for only a short time (as in most annual plants) and is ended by a big bang of lethal seed production - N then dominates the demo- graphy. In other organisms such as the bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) the establishment of new genets is very rare, clonal growth dominates the process of colonisation, genets are few and very long lived and the A 1.

The recognition of modules of construction in higher plants has a long tradition in classical plant morphology (recently reviewed by White 1979) - all that is new is the recognition that such modules form the basis for a demographic treatment of growth. It must be stressed that modular units can be recognised at a variety of levels and for the ecologist there is an element of free- dom in choice of the most appropriate module for study. A number of examples of recent applications of this form of analysis are given to illustrate the approach. (1) A tree is a population of buds. During the time interval of a growing season these buds may have a variety of fates. A bud may die, remain dormant or grow out to form a shoot. If it grows out it may produce a further bud that replaces it and several others. The probabilities of these various fates can be determined in the field and the programme of development of the tree as a population of buds can be modelled as a matrix - rather like the predictive models for the growth of a population of higher animals devised by Leslie and de- scribed in detail by Williamson (1972). In the tree a bud forms part of a canopy within which there is a variety of branch orders. A lateral bud on a second-order branch may grow out to produce a third-order branch and the apical bud of this branch will be a third-order bud - lateral buds on this branch, if they grow out, will form fourth-order branches and bear lateral buds that in turn may contribute fifth-order branches. Thus the canopy develops a hierarchy of branch orders and a branching matrix can specify the transition frequencies from one branch order to another. Fig. 1 gives an example of the branching and vector matrices for one season of de- mographic change determined on an isolated tree of Betula pendula. This study (Maillette 1979) is in too preliminary a stage to determine how valuable it is as a predictive model but it suggest that the overwhelming determinant of the growth of this tree is the behaviour of the leader shoot. So overwhelming is the role of the leader in the total bud dynamics that a matrix for the leader is conveniently separated from that for the rest of the tree. It is now an intriguing question whether such a branching matrix is characteristic of early pioneer species: we might hypothesise that the form of the branching matrix for a spruce might be very similar but that for an oak or a beech would be quite different. The demographic modelling process is now right for exten- sion to analysis of the way in which neighbouring trees influence the bud dynamics of each other. (2) The distribution of births and deaths in a popula- tion of buds determines the form or architecture of the plant (or of a modular animal). Form is a sadly neg- lected aspect of plant growth, particularly in ecology. Most modular organisms are fixed and rooted and the variety of vital activities, that in a mobile animal are accomplished by patterns of behaviour (search and choice of food, mating, competitive interactions with neighbours, escape from enemies), are achieved in higher plants mainly by variations in form. One is tempted to generalise that form in plants is the equival- ent of behaviour in animals. It is possible to combine the information obtained from studying a tree as a population of buds with infor- mation about the position of the buds and so describe its developing architecture.

OIKOS 35: 2 (1980) 249</page><page sequence="7">a model the constraints brought about by the proximity of neighbouring trees, and so develop a predictive synthesis of forest growth. The first phase is clearly to develop models for describing the growth of the plant in isolation. Information about the schedules of birth and death of buds, combined with information about branch angles and internode lengths can be assembled together in a computer programme suitable for the graphic dis- play of form. Examples of the application of such techniques for trees and also colonial hydroids have been given by Harper and Bell (1979). In some cases the 'rules of growth' are very precise as in the rhizome growth pattern of Alpinia speciosa (Bell 1979) and Medeola virginiana (Bell 1974) (Fig. 2). The technique has been applied to the growth of the rhizome systems of Carex arenaria (Noble et al. 1979) and also to the growth of some trees (Harper and Bell 1979). Very recently, there has been an interesting convergence of this way of analysing ecologically relevant aspects of plant form and the new descriptive morphology of tropical trees and other plants associated with Halle and his colleagues at Montpellier. They recognise a variety of special growth forms that depend on the reiteration of characteristic modules - though in their approach the module is itself a branch unit (HalU and Oldeman 1970, Jeannoda-Robinson 1977, Torquebiau 1979). We are, at present, much concerned with the descrip- tion of a variety of branching forms in the plant and animal kingdoms, using the computer graphic simula- tion of bud and shoot demography. We are particularly interested in the ways in which neighbouring plants af- fect the probabilities of the various fates of buds in neighbouring trees, shrubs (Salix repens), herbaceous plants with stoloniferous growth (e.g. Oxalis cor- niculata), fungi in culture and colonial hydroids (Cam- panularia). All of these organisms possess growth forms that determine (at least in part) their ecological role in nature. The demographic approach to plant form gives a new meaning to much of classical plant morphology. In par- ticular it begins to make it possible to quantify the ways in which an individual plant enters into the environment of a neighbour. Clegg (1978) has, for example, distin- guished grassland herbs into two morphological categories, 'Phalanx' and 'Guerilla'. A phalanx growth form is represented by, Deschampsia caespitosa. A genet of this species develops as tightly packed tillers (modules). In such a growth form the most likely neighbour of a tiller is another tiller of the same genet (the same is true for its roots). The growing genet pre- sents an advancing front (a phalanx) - almost im- penetrable by other plants. Such a morphology consoli- dates the hold of a genet on a local patch of resources and is resistant to invasion by other pasture species. In complete contrast, Trifolium repens, with its extensive stolon system, places its leaves at such a distance that one leaf on a genet is rarely likely to shade or be shaded by another leaf on the same genet. Such a growth form minimises the chance of intra-clonal contact and pre- sumably competition but at the same time maximises interspecific and interclonal contacts. Such a plant is continually on the move in the grassland system - con- tinually meeting new neighbours and retaining no per- sistent hold on any one patch of terrain or resources. A consequence is that the nature of the selective forces met by a clover plant in a pasture are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those experienced by a plant with phalanx population structure (Turkington and Harper 1979). (3) A plant grows by the gain and loss of parts. Many attempts have been made to devise methods that record the growth of plants so that the influence of environ- mental conditions can be readily detected. Most such methods are based on techniques of growth analysis and concentrate on measuring changes in plant dry weight (or its components). There are serious difficulties in such procedures: (a) they require destructive sampling so that a time sequence of plant weights can be obtained from which growth rates can be calculated, (b) for this reason it is virtually impossible to measure the genetic component of growth rate phenomena - unless large scale family analysis is done, (c) the method is not easily adapted to use in the field because of the need for ac- curate replication of individual plants from which to produce a time course of growth stages, (d) growth rate is a weak measure of the reaction of a plant to its envi- ronment because two plants may have the same growth rate but in one case both gaining and losing parts at a very fast rate and in the other gaining and losing parts very slowly. Thus, under different conditions the gross flux of plant parts may be very different though the net growth rate may be the same - growth analysis cannot detect such flux phenomena. Some of the arguments for and against growth analysis as an ecological tool in laboratory studies are given in Bazzaz and Harper (1977), Hunt (1978) and Hunt and Bazzaz (1980). The technique is even more open to criticism in field studies. Demographic analysis of plant growth is readily fol- lowed in the field - it is non-destructive, so individual plants can (indeed must) be followed over time - and performance can be judged on a variety of parameters such as the birth or death rate of leaves (or buds). Sys- tems that may have the same growth rate but quite dif- ferent population flux can be readily distinguished. This latter point is particularly important in productivity studies because identical productivity of a piece of veg- etation may be obtained by high birth and death rates of plant parts (rapid flux) or by low birth and death rates. Thus a vegetation with a high rate of turnover may not be distinguished from one with low turnover unless a formal demographic analysis has estimated the flux. An example of the application of this type of demographic analysis in the field is shown in Fig. 3. Populations of Carex arenaria growing on sand dunes were treated with fertiliser at 100 g per m2 (20% N, 8% P205 and 14% K20).

(From Noble et al. 1979). and control plots and new shoots were mapped as they appeared and the death of shoots was also recorded. The figure shows birth and death rates per month fol- lowing treatments. In the Mature and Senile phases of the dune system the birth of new tillers slightly ex- ceeded deaths so that the population as a whole in- creased following fertilisation application, as expected: what was more surprising was the tremendous surge in the flux - both birth and death rates of tillers increased dramatically in fertilised plots and were closely parallel over most of the year and a half of study (Noble et al. 1979). The phenomenon of high death rates of plant parts coinciding or closely following high birth rates appears repeatedly in such studies. In closed communities the broad generalization can be made that the birth rate of plant parts is highly correlated with the death rate. This is particularly noticeable in seasonal studies (e.g. on pasture grasses and weeds (Peters 1980), on Am- mophila arenaria in sand dunes, Ranunculus species in grassland, Sarukhan and Harper 1973, Clegg 1978). It is in the seasons in which new plant parts are produced rapidly that the death of plant parts is also fastest. The near synchrony of the two processes strongly suggests that they are causally interrelated. Very characteristi- cally, leaves that are produced in a pasture during the winter have an expectation of very long life - whereas leaves produced in the height of the growing season have a short life (Peters 1980). (4) Biotypes can be compared in their own and alien environments by demographic methods. Most studies of ecotypic differentiation within a species are performed by transplanting from a variety of habitats into a garden or a controlled environment; differences are then often expressed in this common environment. However, the differences that show in this specialised environment may be quite irrelevant to understanding the extent to which the various forms are 'fitted' to, or appropriate to the environments in which they are naturally found. The extent to which such biotypes are specialised to their particular environments can most readily be detected by reciprocal transplanting - plants of each form are lifted and transplanted - both back into their original site and to an alien site (Turkington and Harper 1979). A series of such reciprocal transplant experiments permits the extent of local specialisation to be determined. Such procedure determines not just whether two populations are different, but also whether the differences are relev- ant in the different habitats. It is possible to perform such an experiment and to determine plant performance by subsequently lifting the plants and determining dry weights - but (as in growth analysis) this destroys the plants. Demographic methods may be used to follow the behaviour of transplants during their establishment and growth by determining the birth and death rates of their leaves, buds or shoots. An example of such procedure is due to Clegg (1978) who made reciprocal transplants of Ranunculus repens from a pasture and an adjoining woodland. The species was abundant in both com- munities and the populations sampled were less than 100 m apart. A variety of aspects of growth were meas- ured and for each a coefficient of selection was calcu- lated as a measure of the depression suffered by a biotype in the alien habitat. Thus Tab. 1 shows values for: Performance of the alien population Coefficient Performance of the native population of selection Values of 1.0 imply that each form is unspecialised to its own habitat and performs equally well in the other. Values less than 1.0 imply (and measure) the extent of Tab. 1.

Clearly in this case the populations of R. repens are strongly differentiated and each (in the measured respects) performs best in its habitat of origin. (5) Animals rarely eat whole plants - they usually take leaves or other plant parts. There are exceptions to this general rule - for example, slugs and snails may eat whole seedlings while they are still very small. In gen- eral, however, herbivores sample parts of plants - tak- ing leaves or seeds or buds, not killing the plant but leaving it damaged. It may then regenerate or may die as a secondary consequence of the damage. Thus, the food supply of a herbivore is usually better defined as the available population of food plant units (leaves, buds, seeds) rather than as the number of plants pre- sent. (The great plasticity of plants means that the number of plants and the number of plant parts on an area of land are often only weakly related). Forest en- tomologists have long recognised that the number of trees in an area of forest is a poor estimator of the availability of food for leaf predators - the number of leaves is far more relevant. The number of leaves pre- sent in a forest or a grassland is the resultant of the birth and death rates in the leaf population and is approp- riately treated as a demographic phenomenon and analysed as such. An attempt has been made by Peters (1980) to analyse a grassland pasture as a population of leaves and to determine the role of herbivores in the death risks experienced by the leaves. He marked shoots or tillers of grasses and dicots (Lolium perenne, Trifolium repens, Ranunculus bulbosus, R. repens and R. acris and Achillea millefolium) and followed over 18 months the new leaf births and deaths of leaves in the sward.

Fig. 4 illustrates the proportion of the standing crop of leaves that had suffered predation (whole or partial removal of leaves or leaflets) through the major part of the growing season. The pasture had been grazed by sheep during the period of study but their movements were determined by the farm manager who sometimes introduced them for periods of part of a day and some- times for much longer depending on the availability of herbage and his special needs to accomodate them at the time. The contribution of the various predators to the observed damage is illustrated in Fig. 5 for Trifo- lium repens and Ranunculus repens. The figures de- monstrate some remarkable effects. For example, a high proportion of Ranunculus leaves were damaged by sheep and a surprisingly small proportion of clover leaves. By contrast, a large proportion of clover leaves were damaged by molluscs which were relatively unim- portant causes of damage to Ranunculus. Weevils con- tributed a large fraction of the damaged leaves in both species particularly in mid-season - though they never removed whole leaves or leaflets but only circles from the laminae - it is not known how much damage their action may have on the assimilatory capacity of a leaf. The interesting feature of this study is that by con- centrating attention on a unit of plant growth that is born and dies it allows the very complex seasonal ac- tivity of a group of predators on a complex mosaic plant community to be analysed into a matrix of individual species-species effects. There is potential for much further development of demographic approaches to such a plant community. It should, for example, be pos- 252 OIKOS 35: 2 (1980)</page><page sequence="10">sible (and Peters 1980 describes a preliminary attempt) to determine the age-specific activity of leaves in the pasture (.g. changes in the photosynthetic and respirat- ory activity of a leaf as it ages) and to combine this with the known age structure of the leaves in the pasture to make predictive estimates of pasture productivity. The age dependence of metabolic activities is usually ig- nored in the analysis of pasture production. The examples of plant demography given in this paper illustrate a form of theory - a scheme of ideas or statements about a few of the ways in which plants and plant communities behave. A theory is valuable to a science in so far as it (1) suggests experiments or observations that will test it, (2) serves as a source of prediction, (3) contributes to the ordering of know- ledge. A really good theory makes the understanding of the real world easier than it was before, if only by quan- tifying that for which we previously had little informa- tion. This paper is limited to studies of 9-populations. Broader aspects of the demography or population biology of plants include the phases of seed production, establishment of seedlings, mortality of genets as well as of modules (reviewed in Harper 1977). For the popula- tion geneticist or evolutionist a demography at the module (rI) level is almost irrelevant - he needs to know about births and deaths of genets - of genetic individu- als. Concentration at the -population ignores this vital element of population biology. There are, however, many field situations, especially those dominated by perennials and clonal plants, where identification of genetic individuals is impossible or extremely difficult. In those circumstances, and where considerations of productivity are important, the theory that a plant is a population of parts that are born and die seems to con- tribute some new insights to ecology.
