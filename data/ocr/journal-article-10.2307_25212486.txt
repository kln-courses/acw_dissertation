<plain_text><page sequence="1">FARABPS FUNNY FLORA: AL-NAWABIT AS "OPPOSITION" By Ilai Alon Introduction1 In his description of the excellent city (Kitdb al-siydsat al-madaniyah and "Am ahl al-madlnah al-Jadilah), al-Farabi mentions those citizens who are not philosophers, but rather the opponents of the principles of their community. To these groups, of which several are enumerated al-Farabi refers either as "the rest" (al'Bdquri),2 or, "al-Nawdbif\3 It is this group, and in particular this name, that is intriguing, for although on the face of it it carries no politico-religious significance at all, some conclusions that touch upon these fields may be drawn by scrutinizing it. I would like to show that al-Farabi abstracted the private name of the Nawdbit and gave it the meaning of "opposition". In order to do this I will analyze his use of the name along the following lines: first a short survey of the lexical usage of the root nbt\ then I will show that the Nawdbit were regarded by al-Farabi as oppositional; then that they belong to the excellent cities; that their description entails all areas of political activity; that al-Farabi was aware of the meaning of the name; that he used it in an abstract manner and the reasons for his choosing this particular name for "opposition". Secondly I will show the earlier use of the name by a real historical group, and finally its later use by Ibn Bajjah. The question of the origin of the name of the Nawdbit is not a new one. Several medieval and modern writers tried their hand at it, but they all seem to have failed to provide a decisive explanation for the name. Thus, E. Rosenthal, while rejecting the possibility that the name's origin is to be found in Plato,4 renders it "spontaneous growth" and suggests a relationship between the Nawdbit and the Nabateans5 and Madelung translates it "Neuerwachsene".6 Literally the stem has been used to render the sense of growing with reference to plants, but it lends itself very easily to metaphorical use as well: in the Qur'an man is compared to plants,7 and 'AH is reported8 to have likened the Caliph's 1 I should like to thank Michael Bonner, Michael Cook, Manfred Halpern, Etan Kohlberg, Prof. W. Madelung, Muhsin Mahdi and Roy Mottahedeh for their help in making the good parts of this paper. For the other parts I admit debt to nobody. 2 Al-Farabi, "Ara, 278, 12 as distinct from the philosophers and their followers. 3 In 'Ara, the term Nawabit appears in a distorted manner as nawa'ib, where it indicates individuals outside the excellent cities.

Classical dictionaries found the noun at least ambiguous,9 and sometimes the stem seems to have been connected with ghmr, another root with negative connotations.10 I should first like to go into a brief treatment of the individual groups dealt with by al-Farabi under the title oVNawdbit" that seem to be six major ones and eight subgroups.x x The Excellent City i i The Philosophers The Nawabit i i i i H i 6.

Mutaqannisun12 The first group mentioned by al-Farabi is the Mutaqannisun. The root QNS is usually employed to indicate hunting, in particular of birds,13 and as far as I am aware, it bears no political meaning.14 Members of this group differ from the philosophers in the excellent cities in that their goals are other than felicity,15 namely honour, power or riches or some other goals, all such that may be achieved by laudable deeds.16 Parallel to the Mutaqannisun, and similar to them, 'Ara' ahl al-madlnah al fadilah reports17 about an unnamed group, in the domain of religion, who 9 They speak of "lowly and poor man" (Lisan, vol. 2 p. 403, 1) but also of "nobility" (ibid., p. 403, 4) and "the young generation" (ibid., p. 402, 4), or "anything fresh" (ibid., vol. 2 p. 401, 6). 10 See note 34 below. Lisan vol. 2 p. 402, 6. 1 * E. I. J. Rosenthal, e.g. divides them into four major and two minor groups (1955) p. 170, n. 31. 12 Al-Farabi, Siyasat p. 104, 7. 13 The root QNS was also used by two people as a name: Bazar whose mother was called Qanas(?) (Tabari, op. cit. I 1111, 1) and Qanas b. Ma'ad (Tabari, ibid., I 748, 7). 14 Najjar translates this term as "opportunists" in Lerner and Mahdi, Political Philosophy, p. 53. 15 See "Ara, p. 290, 13 for the generation of improper views in "the [excellent?] cities". 16 The distinction between views and deeds is an important element in al-Farabi's writings. E.g., kalam is divided into two parts according to this distinction (Ihsa'al-ulum, p. 131, 13). 17 "Ara\ p. 304, 3.</page><page sequence="3">224 FARABI'S FUNNY FLORA pretend to adhere to religion and ethics, but actually entertain plans for personal gain. The only clear title that al-Farabi attaches to them is the domain of their activity, namely piety (khushu). Their main views concern (1) belief in God and the Spirituals, and (2) belief in the world-to-come at the expense of this world. Paradoxically enough, their very behaviour engenders love and respect among people towards them. In his notes to this passage, Walzer18 does not raise the possibility that these characteristics may point to a particular group or person in Islamic history or contemporary politics. Instead he concentrates on the Greek origins of the description. 2. Muharrifah19 The second group that al-Farabi mentions is the Muharrifah. This group desires (hawan) the goals of the ignorant cities, but is debarred from working towards them by the cities' laws (sharaY) and religion (millah). They therefore distortingly (harrafu) interpret (ta'wil) the sayings and inscriptions of the lawgiver in such a manner as to justify (hassana) their goals. The stem of the name of this group obviously has a negative connotation: it is employed in hadlth in connection with interpretation (tafsir).20 3. al-Mariqah2 { The third group, al-Mariqah, is characterized first by the evaluation made by al-Farabi that they mean no distortion (tahrif), and that their acts are only wrong because they fail to understand the intentions of the law-giver. They also misunderstand the city's legalities ("umur sharaY al-madinah) without even realizing their mistakes. While the Mutaqannisun and the Muharrifah are referred to by their name (ha "uala' yusammauna Mutaqannisln), the author refers to the Mariqah not as a name but rather as an identification (faha'ula" hum al-Mariqah), perhaps to indicate that there is no need to introduce the name to the reader, because he is already familiar with it. 4. The Mustarshidun22 The fourth group of the opposition is that of the Mustarshidun. These are people who permanently cast doubt,23 and as a result find themselves both misled 18 'Ara, p. 492. 19 Siyasat, p. 104, 10. 20 Al-DarimI, op. cit. Muqaddimah, 56. 21 Al-Farabi, Siyasat, p. 104, 14. 22 Al-Farabi, Siyasat, p. 104, 17. The same group, under this name is mentioned in yAra, p. 280, 15. Walzer (ibid., p. 282, 22) translates the name as "those who seek the right path". 23 The term al-Farabi uses is tazyif, which in a literal sense would mean "blaming for falsity"; "refutation". See the definition of kalam (Ih$a\ p. 131, 10) which consists in "refuting the views that oppose the religion which the mutakallim is set to defend".</page><page sequence="4">FARABI'S FUNNY FLORA 225 and misleading others in theory (bil-aqdwil), although in practice they look for truth. Their doubting leads the members of this group from a lower stage to a higher one until they are brought24 (by an unspecified agent) to the final stage, that of truth which reflects "things as they are" (al-ashyd" 'aid ma hiya), where their doubts disappear.25 Their process is not one of misunderstanding, but rather of doubt and refutation. The verb zayyafa as used here does not carry a criminal connotation, but rather an attempt to settle inconsistencies, or to refute another's arguments. This is a kind of interpretation, and unlike that of the Muharrifah, it is of a positive goal that is not intended to contradict (tudnid) the excellent city. Al Farabi uses the stem here in two different meanings: first it is used in the political sense of opposition: ghair mudnidin lil-madinah al-fddilah, and later, in the sense of contradiction, perhaps logical: mawadi yumkin an tuanad. The Mustarshidun are the "odd-man-out" of the opposition groups: their good quality is their search for truth, and in fact, their doubting. It seems that al Farabi thought highly of them, as he saw in them a potentiality for becoming philosophers themselves. It is doubt and questioning that make the philosopher, and what is perhaps more important, it is the knowledge of when to stop doubting and to be able to recognize truth, an ability lacking in the next party, those of ignorant goals. 5. Those of Ignorant Goals2b A very similar ideology is shared by members of the next group. These people distort (zayyafa) what they represent to themselves (takhayyul), a process that is similar to that of doubt, in that it may lead its practitioner closer to truth. There are a number of differences between them and the previous group: first, they aim at ignorant goals, in particular, power; they object to listening to anyone who might talk to them of felicity and truth, and always look for an argument by which they might defeat felicity. At the same time they try to keep up appearances. The members of this group are discriminated against by al-Farabi in comparison with the Mustarshidun: The latter are elevated to the degree of truth, where the reality of things is explained to them. In contradiction, members of this group do not enjoy this privilege, and they keep to their practice of distortion even when it has been elevated to the degree of truth. This difference can be viewed as a variation on the problem of predestination and free will in that they are brought to distortion by no fault of their own. 24 Al-Farabi uses the verb rufi'a in the third singular passive voice {Siyasat, p. 105, 2). 25 This description of the stage of truth corresponds to al-Farabfs definition of truth in his k. al-Fusus, (Haidarabad 1349), p. 21, 18. See also another definition in his/c. al-Millah, p. 46, 18. 26 Siyasat p. 105, 17.</page><page sequence="5">226 farabI's funny flora Defective Understanding21 The next group can only represent (takhayyul)28 felicity and the principles (mabadir), but they are absolutely unable to understand (tasawwur)29 them properly. They therefore distort what they represent and manage to find what they regard, mistakenly, as the loci of contradiction in it. They are then elevated to a higher degree which they distort too, but because they cannot understand (fahima) truth, they cannot attain it. They are divided into four sub-groups: (1) Those of defective representation (2) Relativists (3) The partisans of conditional truth (4) The distressed 6.1 Those of Defective Representation30 Those of defective representation are characterized by their inability to understand (fahm) truth, even if they tackle the loci of objection (mawadi al Unad),31 because they fail to represent things sufficiently well. As a result, they take those who claim to have attained truth either for liars, whose hidden motif is the search for honour or power (ghalabah), or else for misguided persons. It seems that what this description amounts to is that they take the true philosophers to be the Muharrifah. They thus distort truth and run down those who have attained it. This group in turn, is divided into three sub-groups which are determined by the consequences of this characteristic: (1) Those who blame everyone for being misguided (maghrurun) about everything they claim to have grasped; (2) those who are perplexed about everything, and (3) those who claim that nothing perceived (fima yudraku) reflects truth (sadiq) and that anyone who opines (zanna) that he has grasped anything is a liar. It is those whom the philosophers regard as ignorant novices (aghmar and juhhal).32 It is in connection with this group that al-Farabi advises the leader of the excellent city to attend to each party of the Nawdbit according to their nature and 27 Siyasat p. 105, 13. A group similar to this is mentioned in 'Ara, p. 282, 6 f. 28 For al-Farabfs definition of takhayyul see Siyasat, p. 85, 5: "Representing them (i.e. the principles of existence) means that their representation (khyat), likeness and things that imitate them be sketched in man's soul". 29 For al-Farabi's definition of tasawwur see Siyasat p. 85, 4 ". . . their (i.e. the principles of existence) essence (dhat) be imprinted (yursamu) in man's soul as it is in reality (haqiqah)". 30 Siyasat, p. 106, 1. 31 Translated by Walzer in \4ra' as "grounds for objection", e.g. yAra, p. 280, 11. 32 The term ghumr means a boy devoid of intelligence (Lane, op. cit., p. 2292), and it is used by al-Jahiz in connection with the Hashwiyah as traditionists (taqlid), (Rasa'il, vol. 4, p. 243,13). In Ifca ',133,11, the most excellent of men is like al-sabi wal-hadath walghumr, compared to those of divine intellects.</page><page sequence="6">FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA 227 to punish those who need punishment,33 although the advice is universally applicable to all the Nawdhit. The second sub-group34 of those of defective understanding is that of the relativists. They hold that truth is what anyone thinks it is at a given time. The third,35 the partisans of the conditional truth, claim that no one truly attains truth, and if such exists at all, it has not yet been attained. All these sub-groups have in common one form of scepticism or another. Nonetheless, in his account, al-Farabi does not use the verb shakka. The most he does is to use "perplexity" (hairah) or "opinion" (zann) (although in "Ihsd" al 'ulum he mentions the "sophists" making the point that those who were called by this name rejected science (fulum) and perception (idrak).36 The reason for this choice of terms is probably that those intended here are not the philosophical school but rather some historical group which he was reluctant to name explicitly. In the period of the actual Nawdbit a controversy was under way between the Muftazilah and some sceptics37 (sometimes referred to as "al-Hisbaniyah").3S As a case in point we learn about one incident in which Thumamah ibn Ashras (d. 213/828), al-Ma mun's court theologian, is reported to have confronted someone who believed that "all things are mere phantasy and conjecture, that man grasps them only according to his own mind (which means subjectivity), and that there is no truth in (what we call) reality."39 f Abbas b. Sulaiman, a colleague of Thumamah, is reported to have met one of these "sophists" who wanted to make him believe that "every conviction is nothing but a mirage"40 and elsewhere truth was also referred to as a dream.41 We may assume that similar views were held, at least by some of the schools of the time, such as the Hashwiyah, alias Batriyah,42 alias Ashdb al-Hadith, (perhaps the Nawabitl)43 who were also called Shukkak by Mu'tazilites such as al 33 Siyasat, p. 106, 9. 34 Siyasat, p. 106, 12. 35 Siyasat p. 106, 13. 36 lhsa\ p. 71.12. His own definition of "sophists" has to do with distortion of truth rather than with scepticism. Cf. Ihsa" p. 81, 2. 37 For a condensed description of three schools of scepticism, see al-Baghdadi, Usui, p. 6: one school denies reality (haqiqah) to anything, a second doubts (shakk) the reality of things, and the third claimed that all beliefs (itiqadai) are true. For the view of the speculative theologians about doubt see F. Rosenthal, Knowledge, p. 302.

Idris al-ShafifT and Malik ibn Anas.45 The same name (i.e. Shukkak) was applied to them by the Ibadites as well.46 The Sceptical movement in Islamic lands at the time of al-Farabi may have survived from the Sceptical-Empirical into the epistemology of early Murji 'ism,47 and later, keeping "alive the disputes between Skeptics and Stoics of antiquity to the most subtle detail, and that, up to the fourth and fifth centuries of Islam",48 that is our period. It seems that the tenth century was characterized by a tolerant mood that was accompanied by a spirit of scepticism49 and sceptics at the time were quite numerous. For instance, Abu f Abd Allah al-Basri was one who expressed his radical position in the formula of equivalence of proof.50 In fact, his school may have been a stronghold of scepticism with regard to basic religious principles such as prophecy.51 Perhaps due to the lack of "academic" translation of Sceptic works from Greek, "true skepticism ... in the Greek sense of the word was long extinguished in Islam",52 and in its stead, a different "mild" scepticism was introduced, that did not doubt truth, but only the intellect as a means to attain it. The Batinis for example, held that for ultimate truth, one should turn to talim rather than to reason, as the latter leads to contradictions.53 The Shfite theologian Ibn Baqqal (d. 363/974) argued that if the Imam is the sole source of knowledge, then reason is unreliable54 and that conviction is no more than a function of dialectical ability.55 Al-Farabi's concept of scepticism is clearly the traditional Greek one, and it fits the mould of "philosophical" rather than of "theological" scepticism.56 44 Van Ess (1968), p. 7. For the meaning of shukkak as first applied by the Murjiah to the Sunni traditionalists because of their practice of istithna\ i.e. adding in sha" Allah to the statement "ana mumin", see Madelung, al-Qasim, 236-7, and ibid., SI32 (1970) 239 flf. Also Ibn Abl Ya'la, Tabaqat al-Hanabilah, ed. M. M. al-Fiqi, where Ibn Hanbal is quoted as stating that the Murji ah call the ahl al-sunnah "shukkak".

'Aryan's al-Radd rala-Shukkak wal Murji'ah, where the author may also have the traditionalists in mind as sceptics.

The Distressed5" Last is the group of "the distressed". These people do perceive that truth exists, but their perception is as dim as if in a dream. They believe some of those who claim to have attained truth but fail to do the same themselves, either because of the effort and time required for such an undertaking, or because of their inclination for pleasures. They therefore become distressed and envious, and dismiss the former as misguided, or as lying, persons whose real goals are honour and wealth. Some of these overcome their distress by adhering to ignorant goals themselves until death relieves them from their distress. A few general remarks on all the groups are in order: out of the fourteen groups and sub-groups enumerated in K. al-siydsat al-madaniyah, only three carry a name or a nick-name: the Mutaqannisun, the Muharrifah and the Mdriqah. All the other groups are only referred to by a description. All the groups described by al-Farabi have a common goal, namely felicity. They differ, however in their definition of that felicity, which is very reminiscent of the difference between the excellent city and its external opponents. Since the excellent city is a philosophical entity, objects of knowledge in it are of significance. Al-Farabi mentions three such objects, but the distinction between them is not always clear-cut: the first is felicity, the second is truth and the third "the sayings of the law-giver". In some cases, however, "truth" may mean "felicity" and "the sayings of the law-giver" (which basically is the idea behind the perfect city), but in others it is clear that these are not identical. In contrast with modern politics, the groups described here do not have, in general, a "platform" where their views may be presented. Only three of the fourteen groups are made to state explicitly, though very briefly, their views which revolve around rejecting the concept of felicity as it is accepted by the city. Other groups either state their opposition in the domain of epistemology, or leave the task of finding out their position to the reader. The common denominator of most of these opposition groups is a faulty 57 Van Ess (1980), p. 4. 58 Van Ess (1968), p. 3 refers to al-Farabfs Risalahfima yanbaghian yuqaddam qabla ta "allum al-Falsafah, in Schmoelders, Documenta Philosophiae. p. 4. 1 4 59 Siyasat. p. 106, 15.</page><page sequence="9">230 FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA epistemological process which results from intellectual shortcomings, and which negates the attainability or even the existence of truth. Of the fourteen groups of the Nawabit, three major parties and one sub-group share explicitly the goals of the ignorant cities. These groups are the Mutaqannisun (who are after honour [kardmah], rule [rVasah] or wealth [yasar]),60 the Muharrifah,61 the group which I have labelled as "those of ignorant goals" (whose emphasis is laid on power [ghalabah]62) and the "distressed" who are basically after honour or wealth.63 The goals of the ignorant cities themselves are of the same interest as those mentioned above. The difference, though, is that whereas in the excellent cities some of the Nawabit are not described as having a particular goal exclusively,64 the ignorant cities are established individually according to particular goals, e.g., the city of honour, that of power, wealth, and the like. One may conclude, then, that the goals of the ignorant cities beyond the borders of the excellent ones are the same as those of the Nawabit within them, and if we accept that the ignorant cities are opposed by definition65 to the excellent ones, we may pass the same judgement on the Nawabit. In addition to the cities themselves are those individuals who are "common people" (min afrad al-nas nawa'ib66 al-mudiin),61 whom al-Farabi calls Nawabit. Here it is clear that the Nawabit, if indeed the corrected reading is valid, are those who live outside the perfect city. Accordingly, on the one hand there is a greater affinity between the Nawabit and the excellent cities, of which they are citizens, but on the other hand, "Ara ahl al-madlnah al-fddilah clearly separates them from it and emphasizes the fact that their goals are similar to those of the ignorant cities. The similarity goes even further between the views of the excellent cities' Nawabit and the external ignorant cities: al-Farabi makes the point that the latter are a development of the respective views within the excellent cities: they only come to exist when religion (millah) [and not as Walzer translates - "their religion"] is derived from some old pernicious views.68 Again, in the context of the wrong views that negate the necessary nature of human society and their advocacy of solitude, al-Farabi says:69 "Then, from these [views] (i.e. those about aggressiveness in nature and among humans), any 60 Siyasat. p. 104, 10. 61 ibid. ibid. 62 ibid., p. 105, 7. 63 ibid., p. 106, 15. 64 E.g. the Muharrifah, those of ignorant goals and the distressed. 65 'Ara, p. 252, 15: "In opposition to the Excellent cities is the ignorant city . . ." 66 E^ I.

The antagonism which results from an oppositional status between the excellent cities and the Nawdbit is stressed by al-Farabi, in making it the duty (wajib (ala) of the ruler (presumably the Imam-Philosopher) to watch over (tatabbu) the Nawdbit, to engage them (ishghaluhum) and to treat (rilaj) each kind in an individual manner, be it by punishment (uqubah),10 expulsion from the city, detention (habs) or by fine (tasriffi bad al-amal), even if they are not fit for them.71 The second point that needs to be demonstrated is that the Nawdbit are indeed part of the excellent cities.72 although it is true that in "Ara 'they do not belong to it. Twice in al-Siyasat al-madaniyah the fact that the Nawdbit belong to the excellent cities is made clear: the first, in the opening words of the relevant paragraph73 and the other in its closing words.^4 This city, which al-Farabi defines75 as "a group of people who concur with one another in holding excellent views, and who live near to one another" is substantially different from the one that is compared with the body, all of whose parts complement and cooperate with one another.76 Thus, society in the excellent city is arranged hierarchically, in an order that is one of service rather than of views: the lower groups serve the purposes of the higher ones.77 It may 70 The term can also mean "detention". Cf. Lane, Lexicon, vol 1. p. 2103. 71 Siyasat, p. 106, 9. 72 In Fusiil al-madani, p. 120, 4, al-Farabi makes the distinction between the "necessary" (4aruriyah) and the "perfect" (fadilah) cities. Perhaps this pair of terms is to be interpreted on the quantitative level, i.e. the former means necessary = sine qua non, the other, the superfluous. 73 Siyasat, p. 104, 7 - "Wa'amma al- Nawabit fi al-mudun al-jadilah ..." 74 Siyasat, p. 106, 3 "fa-ha'ula' hum asnaf al-nabitah ft khilal ahl al-madinah ..." 75 'Ara, p. 52, 2. 76 "Ara\ p. 230, 4. ni "Ara, pp. 230, 12-231, 14; see conclusions.</page><page sequence="11">232 FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA still be analysed from the sociological point of view, according to which it includes five classes: (1) The Meritorious (al-afddil) who are the wise (hukama) (2) The Eloquent (dhawu al-alsinah) who are those charged with things religious (hamalat al-din); (3) The Quantifiers, such as the arithmeticians, geometricians and astronomers; (4) Fighters in the Holy war (Mujahidun) (5) Financiers, (Maliyun). Had excellent cities only to be analysed in sociological terms there would be no room left for the Nawabit. This analysis is much closer to the description of the Republic of Plato, and it seems as though al-Farabi had two directions in treating the excellent city: on the one hand the Platonic, and on the other, the Islamic contemporary, and he never really managed to unite these two directions in a happy marriage. It seems that on this point "Ard" and Siyasat differ strongly. It is therefore useful to compare them now: K. al-Siyasat al-madaniyah K'Ard" ahl al-madlnah al-fddilah A dual division: Philosophers A triple division philosophers, and Nawabit those who follow the philosophers and "the rest".

Although they were probably written around the same time, namely between 330/941-331/942,78 the differences between the two books are noticeable. These differences may result from the difference in audience or from differences in the goals of each book. _ It is obvious that Siyasat is much more direct and immediate than "Ard\ In it 78 Sherwani, op. cit. p. 16, 14 and Mahdi (1975) p. 64.</page><page sequence="12">FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA 233 al-Farabi does not hesitate to mention names of actual groups or nicknames that leave little need for guesswork from the reader. Terms like Nawdbit and Mdriqah are very clear, as we have seen, and so it seems that "Ard" was intended more as a propaganda type of book, or perhaps more on the Utopian side, while al-Siyasat was intended to be more on the practical descriptive side. The next point to be demonstrated is that the term "Nawdbit" was indeed used in an abstract sense by al-Farabi. The idea behind the abstract term is its generality which goes beyond the particular. "Opposition" means the common denominator of all the views that are not those held by the people or groups in power. In his survey, al-Farabi touches upon most, if not all the areas that may give grounds for opposition in his, or any city: these include considerations of the domains of politics that have to do with the goals of the cities; philosophy, namely attitudes towards truth and its attainability; economy the acquisition of riches, and personal - gaining power and control. Was al-Farabi indeed aware of the meaning of the term Nawdbit, and did he use it for that reason? The most decisive demonstration in favour of this supposition would be an explicit statement to that effect, but unfortunately I could find none. Second best would be to show that the term was in common use at the time of al-Farabi, and that its meaning was that of "opposition", and it would stand to reason that al Farabi was aware of this use. There is no such evidence either. The third, and least persuasive, but unfortunately the only existent evidence is circumstantial: the very use of this particular term in a political context is so unlikely, that I can think of no explanation for its use, other than al-Farabi's acquaintance with it and his wish to make a point by using it. In addition, the treatment of the group at the very end of al-Siyasat gives it more significance than it would have had in any other location in the book. Other indirect evidence for the generic sense of the word is its use in a double plural that of the noun itself and that of the "city" madinah.19 Walzer thought that al-Farabi may have been thinking of specific events while writing "Ard\so but he has come up with no specific evidence for his statement. Thus, after calling attention to al-Farabi's close relation to the ancient Greek philosophers he says: w\ . . but he (i.e. al-Farabi) is, at the same time, fully aware of the Islamic discussion of his day: this throws new light on these slightly fossilized Greek school topics and fills them with a different life without changing their traditional form".81 He goes further to indicate that al-Farabi's expressions are close to Shi'ite ones, e.g. the view which he shares with them that all the excellent kings (or Imams) are to be thought of as if they were one single 79 Siyasat p. 104, 7. See note 65 above 80 "Ara\ p. 455. 81 "Ara\ p. 472.</page><page sequence="13">234 FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA personality.82 In that, argues Walzer, al-Farabi agrees with the political views of the Shi'ites about the Caliphate.83 If one accepts the observation that although in themselves, the Nawabit had earlier ceased to exist as a separate entity, they had become a part of the Hashwiyah, which survived in the tenth century and continued the controversy with the Mutakallimun*4 one may conclude, I think, that the contemporary ideological environment kept views of the original Nawabit, and perhaps their name as well. A similar phenomenon on al-Farabi's part, namely his reacting to a former and partially extinct reality is manifest in his attitude towards the Mutakallimun: it does not reflect reality in his own time, and may indicate his awareness of the historic rift which took place at the beginning of the 'Abbasid era.85 Let me turn now to a number of expressions of Islamic character used by al Farabi that will help to show that he was aware of the special meaning of the name Nawabit.'8,6 The root hrf employed for the name of the Muharrifah when used within a polemical context was traditionally of a negative content.87 For example, al Darimi (d. 256/869) uses it thus: "Rabbis (Ahbar) and monks (ruhban), while contradicting the Book in their actions sought to cheat their own folk with regard to what they did, for fear that they might lose their positions (tafsudu) and that their own corruption should become clear to people. They therefore distorted (harrafu) the Book by interpretation, and whatever they failed to interpret, they concealed, keeping silent about their own mischief with the goal of holding on to their positions".88 The term ta/wj/was in use in early Imamite literature of Qur'an interpretation, where it meant originally "substitution" of a letter (harf) by another,89 "omission"91 or distortion of the original revelation.90 There were even whole books dedicated to this question.92 In all these instances, the term was a negative one and was directed at the Sunnis. The negative sense of the other term - tahsin that describes the purpose of the Muharrifah in their interpretations, was shared by some in the context of anti Sunnah groups who were engaged in presenting nonsense as valid views (tahsin 82 "Ara, p. 259, 13; 462. 83 Walzer, 'Ara, p. 334. 84 Pines (1971), p. 230. 85 Pines (1971), p. 228. 86 This is a common practice with al-Farabi. See E. Rosenthal (1955), e.g. p. 170. 87 Although Allah is called Muharrif al-qulub ("The Turner, or Incliner of Hearts") Lane, s.v. HRF. For the negative sense, see Dozy, Supplem., I, p. 271. 88 Al-Darimi, Sunan, Muqaddimah 56. The opposite to this term is taqbih, used by al-Farabi in Ihsa\ e.g. 136, 13 meaning "to refute another's argument". 89 See Kohlberg (1972) p. 211. 90 ibid., p. 212, 11. 91 ibid., p. 213, 15. 92 ibid., p. 213, 8.</page><page sequence="14">FARABI'S FUNNY FLORA 235 al-abdtfl).92. Even the term taml is employed here by al-Farabi in a negative sense, although it can also carry a positive one.94 Another term employed frequently throughout the paragraph, that conveys Islamic content is Aghrdd al-Jdhiliyah: it is used in two directions: on the one hand the excellent city is created out of the ignorant cities, and on the other, the latter spring out of the former. Both directions occurred in Islamic history: the creation of the Ummah out of the Jahiliyah, and the deterioration of the Just Caliphate into the Umayyad Kingdom. Incidentally, the word jahiliyah itself is used by al-Farabi in a double sense: a political sense (ignorant cities as opposed to the excellent one) and an epistemological one (that of ignorance as opposed to truth). The name of the Mariqah too, is very heavily loaded in Islamic terminology: in hadith literature it is used to indicate those who cast themselves out of Islam, or who are regarded as having done so.95 fAli is quoted a saying, after killing the Khawarij at the battle of Nahrawan, that the Prophet had ordered him to do the right things (amarani bi-kulli haqq), and he interpreted it to include the killing of the ndkithin wal-qdsitln wal-mariqin.9b Tirmidhi dedicates a whole chapter to this term,97 and al-Jahiz, along with naming a number of sects of his own time (including the Nawdbit), mentions them in this form.98 Not only in a religious, but also in a political context, this word was in use in or around the year 289/901. It appears in a letter sent by 'Abdallah b. Ahmad b. 'Abdallah al-Mahdi al Mansur with reference to the Fatimid uprising: "\ . . fi kulli man maraqa 'an al ta'ah wanharafa 'an al-imdn. . . ."" This is also the way they are referred to by al Ash'ari, according to whose report they were even happy with the name.100 The same term was used by al-Muftadid in reacting to a poem by Yazid, in which the latter called for taking revenge from awliya" Allah - hadha al-muruq min al-din101 and even authorities as late as Ibn Taimiyah identify them with the Khawarij.102 In describing this group, al-Farabi uses the expression kharajah 'an maqsad al 93 Al-Nasafi, op. cit. p. 57. One example of a group that might have been in people's minds in this regard is the Jahmiyah who were accused of distortingly interpreting verse 5, 93 of the Qur'an so as to allow them to disregard Islamic dietary laws. See Ash'ari, Maqalat, vol. I, p. 170, 7. On the other hand, in the fourth form the verb is also employed positively, i.e. "serving God as if He were before one's eyes" (Muslim, Iman, (1).) The opposite to this term is taqbih, used by al Farabl in Ihsa\ e.g. 136, 13 meaning "to refute another's argument". 94 E.g. Abu Da ud, Manasik, 56: "The Qur'an will come down to him (i.e. the Prophet), and he knows its interpretation (taW/)". 95 See al-Bukhari, Diyat, 6 "Wal-mariq ft al-din al-tdrik al-jama'ah". 96 Ibn Abl Hadid, op. cit., VI, p. 129,10 97 Al-Tirmidhi, Bab sifat al-mariqah. 98 Al-Jahiz, Risalah ftal-Nawabit., Rasall, vol. 4, p. 243.

The importance of the religious aspect for al-Farabi is emphasized by him in his Taljsil al sa'ddah;101 he makes the recommendation that the leader be of sound religious convictions. This indicates that al-Farabi was indeed interested in things religious and held strong views, although they were almost always out of sight for his readers. It is true that no religious books have come down to us by al Farabi, except for one for which his authorship has been contested or even proven wrong, i.e., Fusus al-hikamah.108 Does this mean that al-Farabi deliberately avoided the topic? How could one possibly avoid it at the time? Al-Farabi uses extensively and with a very special meaning the term Imam. Could it be the case that he himself participated in the controversy about the Imdmah in a philosophical rather than a religious guise? Good evidence for al-Farabi's employing a specific name in an abstract manner would be to show that although he was aware of the actual views of the specific group, he attributed to "his" Nawabit different ones. This is exactly what happened with al-Farabi's accusation of the Mutaqannisun of employing scriptural interpretation109 that stands in contrast with the attitude of the historical Nawabit (as reported by Mas'udi)110 who opposed the institution of interpretation altogether.111 Having established what "Nawabit" meant for al-Farabi we can now proceed and see if the term was shared by any other author in Arabic. This sect was not unanimous on every issue, so much so that al-Khayyat refers to it in one place as "different (or differing) groups" (firaq mukhtalifah).112 There is enough evidence to indicate that a party or sect of some prominence was in existence at the time of al-Jahiz (d. 869) and later.113 Al-Jahiz wrote an 103 Siyasat, p. 104, 15. 104 Lane, vol. 1, p. 718. 105 Dozy, Supplem., vol. 1, p. 358. 106 Lisan, s.v. khrj. 107 See Tahsil, e.g. p. 45, 6. 108 See S.

In his article he described this group as related to the Mu'tazilah and the Flashwiyah (p. 112), or even as part of them (ibid., p. 113), a view that Halkin adopted (1936, p. 4, n. 5): "without a shadow of a doubt". The Nawdbit in turn are associated with the Sufis and the Karamiyah (van Vloten, p. 114). For Lecomte (op. cit., p. 338) the Nawdbit were identical with the 'Uthmaniyah, a group that he thought had started at about the same time as the Nawdbit.</page><page sequence="16">FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA 237 entire treatise that is dedicated to the Nawdbit,114 and Pellat even names them as one of the three main parties along with the Mu'tazilah and the Shi'ah.115 In fact, it is tempting to surmise that the word as a private name was used for the first time by this author, who still uses it as a derogatory general term in the sense of "novices, the young, newcomers and innovators"116 ndbitat 'asrind wa-mubtadfat dahrina111 as well as a socio-national one: Arabs in general, he claims, both sedentary and Beduin are indisputably better poets than the Muwalladun and the Ndbitah118 who have their origin in the Mawait.119 This remark brings to mind a wild hypothesis that the name "Nawdbif can be explained as a transliteration translation of the Greek Neophytes. This term was used for many centuries by Christians, Eastern and, later, Western alike, to designate new converts, but literally it means "new plants".120 Add to the plausibility of this hypothesis the fact that the term "Nawdbit" appeared first at the time of al-Jahiz and al Ma mun, when the relations with Byzantium became stronger and opened the door to greater influence. Jahiz went one step further on the road from a general term to a particular one when he characterised the Nabiti as one who is rebellious (yakhruju)121 This historical group was very much involved in the politics of the day: al Jahiz describes the situation in his own "difficult and corrupt time" (his Treatise about the Nawdbit was written around the year 226/840)! 22 as follows: "They (the Nawdbit) started to grow (nabatat) and appeared (nasha'at) at that time, they introduced these new illicit innovations (abda'at hadhihi al-bid'ah) namely, advocating Mu'awiyah". They gained considerable power and influence, so much so that al-Jahiz laments that situation in which he felt obliged to pray to God on behalf of the opponents of non-believers.123 Others also describe the Nawdbit in terms that connect them to important political and religious events: In 201/816, two separate groups in Baghdad bearing the name al-amr bil-mdruf walnahiy 'an al-munkar took to arms, which resulted in the victory of ahl al-hadlth by gaining control of Baghdad in the time of al-Wathiq, especially in the year 231/845.124 114 Sometimes attributed to Abu al-Walld Muhammad b.

Sahl al Qadi128 stating that the Qur'an was created.129 Another controversy then occurred, this time over the question of succession to Mamun130 as well as over the ''official colour" of clothes to be worn which al Ma mun decreed should be green, rather than black. In opposing him, the Kufans joined the Baghdadians from a number of quarters: ahl al-bait, the mawali and extremist army officers.131 They did not restrict themselves to Iraq,132 but were also quite prominent in Syria, especially at the time of al Khayyat who calls them "the rebellious sect of Syria".133 The result of these steps was that Ibrahim and Mansur, the sons of al-Mahdi, together with an uncle of al-Ma mun took to arms, gained the confidence of the Baghdadians and deposed al-Ma 'mun.134 It was for this rebellion that Ibrahim b. al-Mahdi borrowed money to finance his military operations. When he failed to pay back the debt, a poem was compiled by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Malik, one of the creditors, in which Ibrahim was referred to as "the leader" (imam) of 'this NabatiyaK\ and the author threatened him with showing this poem to al Ma'mun. The money was promptly returned.135 A sign of the importance of the Nawabit is the report that goes back the farthest with regard to the Nabitah, that of Mas'udi, who tells with reference to' All, in the year 9, about the controversies within Islam. A few schools and sects are mentioned, including the Nabitah.136 For all its historicity, however, the only person who has been explicitly named in connection with the Nawabit is that of the Hanafifaqih 'All al-Razi ibn al 125 Mas'udi, Muruj, vol. 4, p. 338. 126 Tabari, Annates, vol. 3, p. 1098; Mas'udi, Muruj, vol. 7, p. 91; See Pellat (1965) p. 55. 127 Sourdel (1962) p. 39. 128 A governor who had been appointed to his post by al-Ma'mun. 129 Al-Khatlb al-Baghdadi, Tarlkh Baghdad, vol. 12. 130 Al-Ma'mun appointed his successor 'All ibn Ja'far Ibn M. b.

Ibn Qutaibah (d. 276/889), himself far from being a Mu'tazilite, reports139 that the name Nawdbit was given to ahl al-hadith by the mutakallimun, and al-Masfudi mentions them as forming, along with the hashwiyah, a group called fuqaha' al amsar, who, in turn, were one of three main parties of contemporary Islam.140 Their theologians' main points of ideology141 were: (1) Mu'awiyah. The first point made is the very emotional way in which al-Jahiz recounts the refusal of the Nawdbit to condemn Mu'awiyah. This refusal, al-Jahiz states, puts them in a lower position even than the criminal himself.142 The Sunni attitude was taken up by al-Jahiz to show their excessive and unconditional obedience,143 a position that on the one hand could conform with authority, but coming as a complaint from al-Jahiz is intended to portray them as opposition to a rightful regime. To their veneration of Mu'awiyah144 sometimes their support of 'All is added too, a position they shared with the Haramiyah. In counter-arguing the above statement the point was made that even 'Ali himself forbade his followers to condemn Mu'awiyah. and so did fUmar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz.145 The issue must have been so important that in connection with the hadith: "It is related that the Prophet, may God pray for. and bestow, peace on him, said to rAli, al-Hasan, al-Husain and Fatimah: \ am your ally against whomever you fight1".

Al-Ma'mun was dissuaded from taking this step by the high qadi, Yahya ibn Aktham,15 x who put forward the argument that such an action would meet with fierce popular opposition, especially in the east and Khurasan.152 In the year 284/897, when al-Farabi was about 27 years old, al-Mu'tadid contemplated the possibility of issuing the same decree, but he too was dissuaded from doing so. Even a century later, at the time of al-Maqdisi (375/985) there existed in Baghdad a group that "exaggerated" in loving Mu'awiyah, who were also anthropomorphists and belonged, at least in part, to the Barbahariyah, a school of strong Hanbalite, anti Shi'ite and anti-Mu'tazilite positions.153 Al-Maqdisi related the story that on one occasion he, while visiting the Wasit mosque, heard a prophetic hadlth to the effect that on the day of resurrection Allah will seat Mu'awiyah to His right and uncover him to all mankind like a bride.154 The topic of condemning Mu'awiyah was still hot at the time of Ibn Taimiyah, whose view was that such a condemnation was prohibited because Mu'awiyah had been one 146 Quoted in al-Hajiri, op. cit. p. 191, note 1 from al-munyah wal- 'amal, on the authority of al Jubba*!.

Other groups who took up the issue of Mu'awiyah in a like manner to that of the Nawdbit were the Shafi'iyah who claimed that Mu'awiyah belonged to the people of paradise. ($afadi, al-Ghaith, vol. 1, p. 165, 15), and the Hanbalites whom Maqdisi blamed for excessive love towards Mu'awiyah (Maqdisi, Bad\ p. 126) and ahl al-sunnah wal hadith, (Lecomte, op. cit. p. 337).</page><page sequence="20">FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA 241 of the sahabah.155 Another argument put forward in favour of Mu'awiyah (according to Pellat by the Nawabit)156 was that during the entire 40 years that the man served as governor and Caliph, he committed no crime at all.157 A more modest description of the Nawabits' stand was that their basic principle was quitd (avoiding political judgements).158 However, not all students of the events agree on this being the most important matter for the Nawabit: In contrast to Houtsma159 who thought that the main issue advocated by the group was hatred of 'AH, Halkin is of the opinion that they merely supported 'All's opponents and did not really hate him,160 while Lecomte thinks that the group opposed both the 'Alawites and the 'Abbasids.161 All this quite detailed history serves as ample evidence for the vividness of the issues, as well as of the parties involved over long centuries, including al-Farabi's own. Certainly one might say that, judging by the emotionality expressed in the style of al-Jahiz, then the issue of Mu'awiyah was the one most painful for him, and probably for his contemporaries. Although it seems to me that there is very little in common between al-Farabi's account of the Nawabit and that of the other authors, it is possible that al-Farabi's view about Mu'awiyah was similar to that of Ibn Rushd, namely that he exemplified the transition from a perfect society and government into an impaired kingship, from accepted traditions to whimsical (ahwa7) innovations.152 (2) Election of the Imam The Nabitah are mentioned as one of the groups that had held the view that the Imam should be elected by the Ummah. or by part of it,163 on which issue they were vehemently opposed by the Mu'tazilah, who put it under the title of "the solidarity of the many" (wilayat al-jamf).164 The '' Uthmdniyah movement in the ninth century, which supported the Umayyads, were not so much for their return, as they were opposed to the veneration of'All by the Rawafid. They did point out the positive aspect of 'Uthman being elected by the council. 155 Al-Jahiz, Risalah, p. 3; Ibn Taimiyah, Yazid, p. 21, 9. 156 Pellat (1956) p. 59. 157 Among the philosophers, Ibn Rushd agreed with the view that with Mu'awiyah the Caliphate had deteriorated into timocracy = mulk. See Ibn Rushd, (1956), p. 223; 291. This view is in line with traditional political thought in Islam. See e.g., Ibn al-Tiqtaqa, Fakhri, p. 102. 158 Lecomte, op. cit. p. 338. 159 Houtsma, ZA 26 (1911) p. 196 160 Halkin, op. cit. p. 3. 161 Lecomte, op. cit. p. 337. 162 See E. I. J. Rosenthal, (1956) p. 290, who refers to Ibn Rushd's Talkhis Siyasat Afldtun. The same attitude in al-Jahiz, Risalah, p. 117, 13 f. 163 Election of the Imam is practised by the Shurd, and was advocated by a faction of the Zaidites. See Maqalat I p. 135, 1. 164 Al-Khayyat, Intisar, p. 102, 1. The solidarity is that agreed on by the Mu'tazilah and other Sunnites with all the companions except for Mu'awiyah, who was only supported by al-Ndbitah and al-fi'ah al-bdghiyah min ahl al-Sha'm. I am indebted to Prof. Madelung for this remark.</page><page sequence="21">242 FARABfS FUNNY FLORA (3) Anthropomorphism One of the gravest and most frequent accusations made against the Nawdbit was that of anthropomorphism (tashbth),165 and it is more often made by association with other groups whose views on the matter were well-known e.g., the Jews and the Nawdbifs "brothers" from among the Rdfidah166 and the Hashwiyah.161 Even some modern scholars have adopted this method of describing the views of the Nawdbit, e.g. the Karamiyah, whom van Vloten described as a mixture between the Nawdbit and Sufism, and who held the view that Allah has a body.168 (4) Creation of the Qur'an:169 The Qur'an is uncreated. However, al-Jahiz accuses170 the Nawdbit of attaching to it all the attributes of creation without calling it by this name. They are forced into this position because they do not differentiate between^the speech of humans, which is not created by them and that of God. We know, or at least we learn, that the Nawdbit did not always speak in one voice on this matter, to the extent that some even accused others of disbelief.171 For Madelung they are "the traditionalists" and he quotes al-Jahiz as arguing "that on the one hand they use with regard to the Qur'an terms that imply creation, but on the other hand do not admit the term "khalq", because they imagine God speaking in the same fashion as human beings speak, and human beings do not create their speech".172 (5) Predestination The Nawdbifs stand on the topic of predestination is not unequivocally determined either: al-Mas'udi reports two contradictory views allegedly held by them: on the one hand they are not included in his list of the partisans of free choice,173 but on the other hand, later, in the same work they are mentioned and criticised by 'Abd al-Rahman Muhammad al-Wali in the year 345/956, along with other partisans from "the Mu'tazilah, the Zaidiyah, the Khawarij, the 165 Al-Jahiz, Risalah, p. 119, 4.

The views of the Nawabit on anthropomorphism correspond to those of ahlal-hadith wal-sunnah, ibid. I, 320 ff. The Nabitah share anthropomorphistic views with the Rawafid, and both are clear heresy.

This attitude is expressed in Ihsd" al-'ulum, Fusul al madani and De int., and one can see that he favoured, at least in this context, the Mu'tazilite position, although he did not mention them by name. This failure caused Zimmermann to observe that it was a sign of disdain that he failed to make a common cause with them.17"7 It is interesting that he did not stop to elaborate on this issue in his portrait of the Nawdbit, which may indicate once more his lack both of information on and interest in their actual standpoint. On the other hand, although his position seems to have been against that of the historical Nawdbit, his failure to elaborate on the point is curious. It could be interpreted, however, as a sign that he had already dissociated himself completely from this specific case, and only dealt with the abstract for which instances of agreement and disagreement are of no consequence. (6) Textual interpretation (ta\vil): Al-Farabi went to some length to attribute to some of the Nawdbit the technique of scriptural interpretation (ta'wil) for the purpose of strengthening their goal in an illegal manner (tahsin). As a historical fact, the Nawdbit were quite opposed to this technique and to those who practised it most the Bdtiniyah. Al-Jahiz connected the Nawdbit with the slogan of Bild kaifa, the celebrated principle of the Hanbaliyah.178 (7) God's ability to do wrong, (tajwir) The Nawdbit seem to have taken part in the theological controversy over God's ability to do injustice,1"9 taking the position that this was indeed possible for Him.180 In this they were at variance with the Mu'tazilah as represented in this 174 Mas'udi, Tanbih, p. 337, 7. The views of the Nawabit correspond, although with a difference, to the report in Maqalat I, p. 321. 175 Al-Khayyat, Intisar, p. 105, 15. 176 Ibn al-Nadlm, Fihrist, (English translation), I, p. 446. 3. 177 Zimmermann, Introduction to his edition of De int. pp. cxi and cxvL Compare al-Farabfs definitions of choice (ikhtiyar) in ffa, p. 124, 4; Siyasat p. 72, 9 and "Ara, p. 205, 14 which certainly accept human choice. 178 Al-Jahiz, Risalah, p. 120, 22. Cf. Maqalat, vol. 1, p. 322, 23 for the attribution of this position to ashab al-hadith wa-ahl al-sunnah. 179 For God's ability to do injustice, see al-Ash'ari, Maqalat, I, p. 138, 19 ff. where part of the Zaidiyah is described as holding this view. The main discussion though, is that of the Mu'tazilite views on the topic (ibid. I, p. 252 ff.). Even some Mu'tazilites agreed that Allah is capable of doing injustice, e.g. al-Iskafi (ibid. I. p. 253, 13). 180 Al-Jahiz, Risalah, p. 119, 9; 14</page><page sequence="23">244 FARABl'S FUNNY FLORA paragraph by al-Na??am,181 holding the view that God is bound by nothing, including His own promise. Thus, "Those among the Nawabit who practised kalam claimed that God can do injustice (zulm)", a view they shared with the eternity in paradise in reward for their obedience in this world,183 or even send Ibrahim al-Na??am that God can put in hell those who had been promised eternity in paradise in reward for their obedience in this world,18 3 or even to send the inhabitants of Paradise to Hell in spite of His promise. They further said that the expression "After having stated that He would do something, God can refrain from doing what He had said He would do" is paradoxical and has no meaning at all, once God had indeed said that He would do that [thing].184 (8) Divine knowledge: The Nawabit believed that God knows by means of eternal knowledge, a view strongly opposed by Abu al-Hudhail the Mu'tazilite.185 (9) The $ahabah. The group, as reported by al-Khayyat seems to have held much in common with asbab al-hadlth and the MurjVah. on the issue of the sahabah and their rights. They differed from them however over the identity of some of these people and their order of priority.186 As a considerable part of the description of the Nawabit, the technique of comparison and combination was widely used by authors who dealt with this group. Thus, for an educated reader, seeing their name mentioned along with another group or groups, reveals by itself the author's attitude towards them. For the most part the Nawabit are combined, as we have seen,187 with the Ifashwiyah,188 but also with the 'Ibadiyah, with whom they were attacked by Bishr Ibn al-Mu'tamir189 in a poem190 he wrote, and the Rawdfid191 who used the name "Nawabit" for the traditionists.192 181 For his detailed position on the issue, as well as that of the other Mu'tazilites, see R. Frank, "Can God do what is wrong?" 182 Al-Khayyat, Intisdr, p. 22, 4. 183 Al-Khayyat, Intisdr, p. 22, 22. 184 Al-Khayyat, Intisdr, p. 22, 4. 185 Al-Khayyat, Intisdr, p. 59, 18. 186 Al-Khayyat, Intisdr, p. 105, 17.

(d. 533/1138) who used the term in his book tadblr al-mutawahhid, indicating that the word has two meanings: (1) A private name for a particular group of people who live in ignorant cities who hold correct philosophical views and as such are the sole candidates for achieving felicity.193 The greater the gap between them and their opponents, the more appropriate is the name. As such each individual is called gharlb and is similar to his Sufi homonym.194 Incidentally, one can trace this view to al-Farabi's: in Fusul muntazaah, the obligation is on the meritorious person (al-fddil min al-nds) to live in the excellent city, if one exists in his time. If none does, then he is regarded as "a stranger (gharlb) in the world, his life is so bad that death is preferable to him to life".195 (2). A generic noun that indicates any opposition, regardless of how right its views are.196 The Nawabit are mentioned as living in the four cities that are not the excellent one. For him, the Nawabit, whose name he suggests means "weeds that spring out of themselves among plants"197 are the cause for the coming-to-be of the excellent city, which he calls "the wholesome city" (al-madlnah al-kamilah)198 out of the lesser ones.199 This direction is opposite to that pointed out by al-Farabi, who allows the Nawabit in the excellent cities to act towards changing them into ignorant ones. His seems more geared towards the notion of Islamic history as starting from a peak and deteriorating with the passage of time. Ibn Bajjah's choice of name for his city makes sense: for him this community has no opposition or difference of opinion, which would imply the existence of false ones.200 Within the ignorant cities, Ibn Bajjah tells us, the Nawabit appear almost as a professional group, along with physicians and lawyers, and are indicative of the inferior state of the society to which they belong. The philosophical views which they hold give the impression of accident (man waqa'a 'aid ra *y sadiq) rather than systematic and intentional striving for the truth.201 Ibn Bajjah does not mention the historical Nawabit explicitly. However, his attitude towards Mu'awiyah, we know, was negative. He pointed out that Mu'awiyah was not preferable to f All, because an examination of these two personalities would reveal their truth.202 This attitude is somewhat contrary to the fact that Spain was ruled by the Umayyads long after they had ceased to govern the East; but on second thoughts, perhaps this explains the fact even better. Ibn Bajjah may have not known the Nawabit directly. He could have drawn all his information from al-Farabi, a possibility which is 193 Ibn Bajjah, Tadbir, p. 43, 1. 194 Ibn Bajjah, Tadbir, p. 43, 9.

Conclusions regarding al-Farabi: 1. Al-Farabi constantly discusses real existing groups. But when he does so, he calls them by other names, or omits to name them altogether. Al-Farabi never addresses himself in partisan fashion to the burning contemporary issues of the imamate. What he does is to treat it in a detached philosophical manner.204 He also gives a precise, detailed account of the sceptical schools and moods of his own time albeit very concisely. If trying to interpret K. al-Siyasat al-madaniyah with the help of'"Ara ahl al madinah al-fddilah is legitimate because of the almost complete parallelism between the descriptions in these two texts, one can learn that al-Siyasat is more outspoken than the latter. Here a severe criticism is levelled against the leaders of the perfect city (taking into account that this is the city where the Nawdbit exist, according to al-Farabi). 2. The different treatment of the Nawdbit in the ''Ara and al-Siyasat indicates a different role for each: the former is used for more general consumption and reflects views that are more favourable to the existing government, while the latter is more realistic in that it takes into account the existence of opposition within the perfect city and even advises the ruler how to deal with it. 3. Al-Farabi did his best to avoid being too explicit in naming groups and views. His intentions show through his efforts, especially by using loaded names and expressions. I therefore would agree that al-Farabi "carefully avoided the theological, sectarian and political controversies"205 of his time but would restrict this attitude to the explicit realm only. Conclusions Regarding Opposition. (1) It was al-Farabi who introduced the term "Nawdbit" in the abstract sense of "opposition". 203 Ibn Bajjah, Tadbir, p. 43, 5. 204 This view stands in opposition to Rosenthal's assertion that "al-Farabi had a purely theoretical interest in politics as a part of practical philosophy" [(1956), p. 199]. 205 Mahdi (1971) p. 524.</page><page sequence="26">FARABI'S FUNNY FLORA 247 (2) The process of the development of this meaning was: (a) A derogatory political general noun used mainly by the ruling Mu'tazilites in the ninth century or perhaps used even earlier to indicate a proto Sunnite group that opposed the "state-religion" of the Mu'tazilah. (b) A derogatory private name used by the ruling Mu'tazilites for the same group. (c) A general unified generic noun used by the semi-neutral to denote negatively all the factual and possible views of a group that opposes the philosophers in the Excellent City. We saw that al-Farabi's Nawabit had in some cases views different from those of their historical homonym. (d) A generic philosphical noun used by the philosophically-neutral Ibn Bajjah to indicate positively both opposition in general, and in particular the private case of opposition which is individual and positive, and is under a hostile government.206 al-Jahiz al-Farabi Ibn Bajjah Attitude Negative Negative-Neutral Positive-Neutral Nature of General Noun + Private Name (?)+ Generic Name Word Private Name Generic Name Political Opposition to real Opposition to Utopian Opposition to real Stance govt, on political govt.

Figure 3 The Development of the Concept (3) One explanation for the choice of this particular term is that while it was indicative enough, it was not overtly offensive, as mukhasimun, Mujadilun or fitnah might have been. The latter, the most commonly used for "opposition" in Islam, carries more than a tinge of religious sense to it, beyond the degree that al Farabi would be willing to concede. This undertone of apparent detachment is also manifest in al-Farabfs reluctance to use terms that are clearly negative. (4) Al-Farabfs importance in this process lies in the fact that he served as a link between the real, actual group with their immediate convictions, and the fully abstract concept as was used by Ibn Bajjah (who, as we saw, was aware of his debt to al-Farabi). It was al-Farabi who was the first to make the abstraction. To the 206 On the whole, a process similar to that was undergone by the Rafidite. See Kohlberg (1972).</page><page sequence="27">248 FARABI'S FUNNY FLORA best of my knowledge, before him no Muslim writer had thought of joining all the sects and factions at variance with the ruling government on different grounds under the same title so as to draw conclusions about them as a unit. (5) Al-Farabi's treatment of the groups in the perfect cities covers the entire range of possible grounds for opposition: political, ideological, personal and economic. In this the Nawdbit as opposition contribute to rendering politics a most broad discipline that is both practical and theoretical, something along the lines suggested by Mahdi in his analysis of Ihsd*201 (6) Finally, this is not a militant opposition, although al-Farabi does advise the leader to take steps against the Nawdbit when such are necessary, steps that may include harsh measures such as detention and expulsion. After all, in the excellent city the battle-ground would be intellectual, would it not? BIBLIOGRAPHIC LIST Primary Sources al-Ansari, Jamal al-DIn M. b.
