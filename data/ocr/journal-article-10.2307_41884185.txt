<plain_text><page sequence="1">History and Science Edward W. Bennett Washington, D.C. CAN seem history desirable be a science to be clear ? It would first seem desirable to be clear first about what we mean by "his- tory" and "science." At the same time, the whole discussion must itself be an attempt at definition, and we will not solve our problem by using pre- liminary definitions which will arbi- trarily settle beforehand the questions we are suposed to be answering. We will therefore make the initial defini- tions minimum ones, which will be ex- panded by the succeeding analysis. An attempt will be made to use the terms "science" and "history" in such a way that they will be applicable to one kind of work which is actually per- formed in these fields. History is the study of change in the course of the human past. This change may be an illusion or Platonic shadow to some minds, but the histor- ian assumes at the least that it is an important thing to study. Indeed, he may well believe in a metaphysical historicity of nature, but this is not important for his work, since con- ventionally he limits his study to the past of the human species. History is of course also Geschichte , the subject matter, the course of the human past itself. But we are not so much con- cerned here with this second meaning. In defining science, we cannot do better that to note the words of Cohen and Nagel in An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method : "The ideal of science is to achieve a systematic interconnection of facts." They add later, "Scientific explanation consists in subsuming under some rule or law which expresses an invariant char- acter of a group of events, the par- ticular events it is said to explain." We must of course remember, as Cohen and Nagel do, that facts are forms given perception by the ob- server. It will be noted that science seeks a formal, invariant order, a kind of logic of nature; it strives to ap- proach the regularity and deductive certainty of logic and mathematics. Also, in describing science as this kind of method we are close to Anglo- American usage, and avoid the vague- ness and ambiguity of equating science with knowledge in general. If we defined science so that it automatically included history, there would be little point in pursuing our inquiry. All of what we are accustomed even so to call "science" has not of course de- veloped form to the extent that physics has; the degree of formal order pos- sessed by a given study is, however, the degree to which it can claim to be scientific. There are, as a matter of fact, a number of ways in which history re- sembles those branches of knowledge we would all accept as scientific. History is empirical, and so are they. Historians and scientists both use hypotheses, as all thinkers must. And historians and scientists both use generalizations. The common asser- tion that history is the study of the particular is not very happily phrased, and has led to some confusion. It will be shown later that there is some sense to it, but we should observe now that it is certainly not true that history is always particular, and that it never generalizes. Some generalization is necessarily imposed by language, and further generalizations about human 132</page><page sequence="2">HISTOBY AND SCIENCE 133 behavior are implied, if not explicitly stated, in every historical work. We constantly find generalizations about aristocrats, peasants, Germans, and so on, some more justified than others. Nevertheless it is apparent that as yet history has not to any significant extent approached science in the systematic search for predictability or regularity. Admittedly one reason has been that historians (from the scientific viewpoint) have tended to take too voluntaristic a view, often believing in free will, or laying stress on the wills of anthropomorphic en- tities such as God or the Nation. If one believes in free will, prediction becomes not only impossible, but also useless. There are other obstacles than the voluntarism of some histori- ans, however. For one thing, there is the nature of the historian's evidence. Though he may wish to construct a regular system, he will find that the documents were not created with any such system in mind. Sometimes they will be scarce and sometimes they will be plentiful - too much so; usually they will be written, though sometimes they will include artifacts, pictures, and so on. But the proportion of evidence that will be statistical will be relatively small and largely ambiguous. And the most accurate survey will rarely be the one the historian himself would like to have had made. He must take what he can get ; he cannot experiment. Another difficulty is the complexity of the historical subject matter. It is true that the most advanced sciences appear to be extremely abstruse, and it would seem unwise to say that any- thing was too difficult for scientific comprehension. But abstruseness is not the same thing as complication. It must be remembered that scientific work proceeds on the assumption of a simple world order, considering the simplest laws the most satisfactory. If advanced physics no longer follows the mechanical models of Newton, it still works towards simplicity and the establishment of regularities. There are no units or entities that may not be altered, dropped, or replaced if other units will permit a simpler, neater, esthetically better explanation. For example, there is the notorious case of the wave and molecular theo- ries of light, one of which is used for explaining one group of phenomena and the other for another. For pur- poses of analysis, the familiar forms of direct experience are replaced by atoms and molecules. But the historian would seem bound to hold fast to the complicated human being as his unit, and he tends to maintain the impor- tance of individual representatives, which the scientist does not attempt to do. In short, the scientist may have an army of facts, but they are well disci- plined. The historian has a militia of rugged individualists. As far as we have taken them, how- ever, such difficulties do not appear insuperable. Although they point up the obstacles to reconciling conven- tional history with science, they do not rule out the possibility of a scientific social study. By dropping the individ- ual and employing generalizing, non- anthropomorphic concepts such as the "role," sociologists and anthropolo- gists seem to be sidestepping the second objection. Psychology makes, by experiment, additional generaliza- tions about behavior. And if by such means a scientific social study could be produced, it would partly answer the first difficulty by providing scien- tific evidence for future historians. No doubt some of the scientific tech- niques would be applicable to the study of the more distant past, as well. The difficulties of experimentation and complexity would probably still exist, but by themselves they certainly will not discourage the social science</page><page sequence="3">134 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR JUNE, 1952 minded. A more basic and decisive obstacle is that of time and causation. Science seeks laws and concepts applicable under particular conditions rather than at any particular time. This is part of what Cohen and Nagel mean by the 1 'invariant character of a group of facts"; this regularity is what science gives us as explanation. The term "law" means a statement of a rule applicable at any time and any place. This regularity necessarily in- volves experimentation; it requires it and makes it possible. Unless phe- nomena are isolated from historical time, we can have no experimental proof and no regularity or predicta- bility. Although generalizations are useful to the historian, it is not they that bring time into his account. Generalizations in psychology and elsewhere are about highly abstract, timeless man, and can only partially explain the concrete macroscopic man who lives in historical time. Cause, which, rather vaguely, means something producing something else, is a concept closely related to time. The ambiguity of the term "ante- cedent" shows the nature of this association. Because of this time implication, because the term "cause" does not distinguish an entity from its function, and because it tends to lead to a belief in a simple animistic causa- tion, scientists tend to drop "cause" in favor of field theory. This employs a nexus of functional conditions, con- sidered as being simultaneous with what we would call the effect. These functional conditions or factors are, in truth, causes, but they can be so proximate to the effect, thanks to re- fined methods of analysis, that the time consideration can be ignored. Hence the scientific effect becomes defined in terms of its "simultaneous" causes or functional conditions, rather than being thought of as a later result of them. The view fits the logical goal of reversible relation, and avoids a flagrant flaunting of Hume's criticism of causation. This kind of abstraction makes for unambiguous analysis and permits measurement, which cannot be applied to the conventional idea of cause. It is, however, an abstraction. It might be supposed that there was sometimes or always a real simultane- ity of cause and effect in nature, just as in the scientist's mind. In that case we would not assume, at least without a special demonstration, that a cause and effect relation in nature involved time. Einstein, however, pointed out that the term simultaneity can have meaning only if two events appear empirically simultaneous to one ob- server, and that they will not neces- sarily be simultaneous to another whose reference point is moving dif- ferently. The actual relative variation according to motion is part of Ein- stein's own abstract theory and does not itself concern us. The thing to note is that simultaneity is a fiction and not real ; if there is any cause and effect in nature, it is not objectively simultane- ous, but presumably takes place in a common time sequence. The dropping of the temporal re- lation is useful for the microscopic sciences, but the historian is justified in refusing to do the same. If he did, of course, he would not be writing history; time is his special concern. But the other social sciences, dealing with macroscopic men and their socie- ties, cannot completely drop time and causation either. There is no quarrel here with functionalizm where it simply means multiple causation and interaction, but the social sciences cannot use it in the sense natural science, and especially physics, does. It might be objected that science sometimes uses functional processes extending over a time period ; this, it</page><page sequence="4">HISTORY AND SCIENCE 135 may be thought, shows the possibility of a scientific analysis of our process. This idea results from the confusion of two different kinds of time. Where rigidly applied, scientific process is very different from historical time as we know it. In it, time is another measurement scale on which the vari- ous factors are scheduled; there is, however, no time interval between cause and effect. The relation of factors to each other is still of the type of a logical relation; they stand in an order which can be expressed as a timeless law. The whole order, in- cluding the time intervals, must be manipulable, repeatable, expressible in numerically quantitative values. All the variables significant for the proc- ess to be observed must be isolated and measured. This experimental process will be observed any (histor- ical) time that we set it going. Now, because we cannot transcend human knowledge, the time men move in is the most comprehensive we can know, the time of history. To the best of our knowledge, this is cosmic time ; we cannot penetrate beyond it. One can if one likes assume that meta- physically we are living in a total closed process ; there is much about the idea that is attractive. But to make a rigidly scientific analysis of this proc- ess, it would be necessary to stand outside it, isolate all the variables, and observe it all more than once. This is not a reductio ad ab sur dam; this is simply a statement of what would be necessary for a scientific analysis of the human process which would, in respect to its terms, eliminate chance. Other kinds of analysis (such as the statistics used by economists) may be scientific, but they cannot claim to approach the predictability afforded by the kind of method that has just been described. One sometimes hears sociologists and others say that they are using a "dynamic" system or analyzing the "social process"; the use of such terms should not blind us to the fact that their science is, and must be, of a rather low-voltage character. There is no desire here to underestimate the value of many sociological concepts, for instance those on the institutional structure ; historians can profit by their use, just as they can profit by recognizing the multiplicity of causa- tion. In fact by replacing some of the variables, sociological concepts make the study of multiple causation pos- sible. It must be admitted that there is a world of difference between the hard thought of a Robert K. Merton or a Harold D. Lasswell and the somewhat showy brilliancies of a D. W. Brogan. But the concepts of the sociologists are, after all, static generalizations, and the "dynamic analysis" by which they are made to live is, in the end, only shrewd historical comment. Where this prevails, there will always be a significant element of chance. We have seen that no social science can claim to be very scientific, al- though some, with collections of abstract concepts, are more so than history. The historian's special em- phasis on differences within time, together with the difficulties mentioned earlier, will help explain why he moves so little in the scientific direction. History does use more and more con- cepts from the other social studies, but it is not even verging on scientific prediction. There always seems to be a market for studies of what has happened in the past, and disinter- ested curiosity has its value. But scientific generalization and prediction can claim to be ultimately useful. Is there any usefulness in the historical record of concrete past experience? First, it may be remarked that, leaving aside the question of free will, the opportunités for "social engineer- ing" are rather limited. Plato's ex-</page><page sequence="5">136 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOE JUNE, 1952 perience in Sicily shows that one philosopher-king is not enough for an ideal state. Bismarck was perhaps the greatest "master mind" of modern politics, but actually his success seems to have rested largely on his under- standing of the possibilities, and he was constantly forced into policies by German nationalists, Hohenzollerns or Social Democrats. People resist being molded. We find that, in daily life, we must deal with individuals who, with- out exception, consider themselves centers of interest. It may be more helpful to see how others think and act, and to know the kind of thoughts they are likely to have. But even so, is there any reason to add the unsys- tematized, relatively concrete experi- ence of history to, say, psychology? Now, the point about unsystematic concrete experience is that this is what forms the experience of society. It is from the point of view of this experi- ence that society sees what it takes to be truth: by getting this experience we became part of society, become mu- tually intelligible. And since, as Hume showed, there is no absolute empirical truth, we must work on the assumption that that is true which all observers agree to be true; our "knowledge" comes from our social experience. Social experience has a moral as well as an intellectual side. Morally, people who do not share the social view are, by definition, asocial. If, within a society, the collective social tradition is weak, we have what Durk- heim called anomie: acute social dis- organization. To avoid this, a store of shared social experience is necessary. This does not mean that we should be intolerant of the dissenter. The shared social experience we speak of, and which we will discuss in connection with history, is not the same thing as orthodoxy; it makes discussion pos- sible, it does not stifle it. Actually the social disorganization we find in the world does not result from free discussion, but from the conflict of orthodoxies which are not on speaking terms. History, when written critically, and not as propaganda, is one of the important ways of gaining social ex- perience, of enlarging it. What exactly do we mean by this? Wilhelm Dilthey devoted himself to answering that question, and with some success. Ac- cording to him we enrich the symbol- ization of history and give it meaning by associating it with our own direct experience. Being men ourselves, we can understand other men, present and past. Unfortunately, there remain about Dilthey certain traces of Ger- man idealism: Thus mind, in sharp dichotomy with nature, is "real real- ity," there is a second and deeper kind of meaning, and an objective spirit (meaning the external manifes- tations of mind, including symboli- zation) is made an entity toward which the subjective individual appears to stand in a somewhat mystical relation. What we now know about symbol and Gestalt enables us to get Dilthey 's basically sound results in a less intui- tive way. This is not the place for a full dis- cussion of symbolism. We need only note that, as the Gestalt psychologists have pointed out, symbols and forms are essential for forming and com- municating ideas. They stand for them and they order them. Now, the mean- ing of the symbols we use in everyday speech is not just the definition we find in the dictionary. There is a great deal of additional meaning which is attributed by us to these symbols because of their association with seg- ments of our own experience. Thus we do not learn the meaning of a word like "battle" from Webster; we learn it from history, journalism, hearsay, and in some cases, direct experience. Scientific analysis seeks clarity in its</page><page sequence="6">HISTORY AND SCIENCE 137 concepts, and avoids this everyday speech with its tendency to ambiguity and inexplicit meaning. When exact concepts are taken over by the public, as happened with the vocabulary of psychoanalysis, they lose their clarity. Clearness and abstraction have their disadvantages, however, since they mean departure from the familiar world of common discourse. We can, of course, enlarge this world by new concepts, but we do not help the public by becoming incomprehensible. For- tunately, it is not impossible to add more meaning to a common word or idea, giving it more social usefulness. History, in fact, performs this func- tion. The historian's words and situa- tions (for historical situations, such as Appomatox, are symbolic) possess meaning through the context of this account; this is taken by the reader and added to the meaning which the same words and the same or analogous situations possess from the rest of the reader's experience. On the other hand, the reader attributes to the ac- count, as Dilthey saw, the directness, the concreteness and emotional signifi- cance, which the words and situations have had for him. The symbols are, in a broader use of T. S. Eliot's term, "objective correlatives." Both the individual's own experience and his understanding of history will grow together in a cumulative way. An ex- ample of this is the way in which even historical dates (like "1929") are not mere numbers, but become symbols for many associations. History is only one source of sym- bolic meaning and shared experience. The greatest, of course, is direct speech. The arts are another source, especially of emotional experience. But history, avoiding both excessive artistry and excessive abstraction, represents the most careful attempt to give the whole, unvarnished experi- ence of the past. At the same time, it adds an interpretation from the pres- ent, taking advantage of hindsight and available concepts to make clear and understandable what was once ex- perienced in a rather disjointed and confused way. It gives us perspective. It does not seek a formal explanation in abstract terms, but it does try to give a kind of form to our ordinary concepts, to the experience we have had directly. As an example of what history can be, mention might be made of Henri Brunschwig's La crise de l'état prussien. It may then be suggested that his- tory as a study is neither science nor art, though having some qualities in common with each. The historian's basis of selection has been a vexed question ; it is clear, however, that the basic determinant must be the con- cerns of society. Admittedly this leaves a very wide field. But should not the field be wide? Marc Bloch and Henri Pirenne are said to have had the capacity for being interested in anything human. The task of giving a whole picture is a hard one ; perhaps we could learn something from such people as James Joyce and Marcel Proust. But the historian's is a worthy job. It depends largely on him whether, in their use of symbols, men can escape from the jungle of myth.</page></plain_text>
