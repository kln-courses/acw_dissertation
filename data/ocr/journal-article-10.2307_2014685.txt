<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Idealism as a Philosophy. R. F. ALFRED HoERNLE. New York: George H. Doran Co., 1927. Pp. xx + 330. Professor Hoernle describes philosophy as the "love of wisdom" whose source is the "deep-seated need in the human mind". . . "to feel at home in the universe" (23), and whose "goal is a vision of the Real which shall satisfy both head and heart," an insight which will enable us "to understand the universe and to approve-nay, to love it" (24). He describes the leading types of idealism as interpreta- tions of the universe in terms of spirit, and to the nature of spirit he takes our value-experiences to be the best clues. If successful, philosophy must interpret the universe as satisfactory to "head and heart," and if idealism is the philosophy which takes values seriously and explains the universe in terms of them, it is a fairly direct in- ference that idealism is the most promising road to the philosopher's goal. But both of the premises of this argument have to be chal- lenged. First, there are excellent reasons to define the goal of philos- ophy as an understanding of the cosmos influenced as little as possible by the human longing to find it hospitable. And second, recent naturalistic and realistic interpretations of the nature and orders of values have been at least as enlightening as idealistic interpreta- tions. Professor Hoernle argues that of all philosophies idealism achieves a preeminent concreteness by its success in "taking up into itself" all modes of experience (including feeling and action, art and religion) and in bringing to light their "real nature" or "truth." Many readers will find here the fallacy of Hegel's doc- trine of philosophy as the "truth" of art and religion. A successful philosophy, whatever its metaphysical tendency, may analyse the characters of esthetic and religious objects and experiences; but if the philosophy is rational thinking it can not pretend to apprehend or express the concrete content of these objects and experiences.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 189 Such apprehension is the work of religious and artistic intuition, and such expression is the work of the arts. Professor Hoernle reckons with both of the above challenges. If he hopes to see philosophy make men more at home in the uni- verse, it is mainly by means of the rational transformation of their hearts' desires. And if the universe is to be understood in terms of spirit, Professor Hoernle argues that spirit can not be taken as anthropomorphic or as abstractly logical, but must be understood as the objective world of science, art, religion, morality, politics- or rather as the absolute completion and synthesis of these and of their natural conditions, which synthesis is said to be their implied ground as well as their consummation. These positions revive diffi- culties prominent in the writings of Bernard Bosanquet, to whose memory the present book is dedicated. Bosanquet lessens the awk- wardness of interpreting the universe as spirit by enlarging the con- ception of spirit into something very like that of the order and sub- stance of nature. However, Bosanquet is not reduced to saying merely that nature is nature. He insists that spirit has still a specific and proper meaning, in the light of which nature can best be understood. To save this specificity he resorts to such doubtful courses as the inference that nature, as mechanical, is encompassed by and grounded in a context organic and teleological. Neither Bosanquet's ingenuity nor Hoernle's has resolved the dilemma: if spirit is what we experience it to be (or reasonably infer it to be from our experience), there is no ground to suppose that it is the universe or the central fact in the universe; on the other hand, if the universe is spirit, then spirit is something we have never expe- rienced as what honestly goes by that name. The chief purpose of Professor Hoernle's book is not to defend idealism, but to provide a "map" to guide beginners "through the mazes of idealistic theory." To this end Professor Hoernhe has pre- pared a convenient analytical table of contents and has taken great pains to introduce technical terms gradually and with adequate definitions. After admirable preliminary treatment of such matters as the attitude proper to philosophical study, and the distinct mean- ings of "idea" and "ideal" in various disciplines and at various historical stages, he distinguishes the four types of idealism which he is to explain and criticize: Spiritual Pluralism (represented by Berkeley and James Ward), Spiritual Monism (represented by Schopenhauer and Bergson), Critical Idealism (Kant), and Abso- lute Idealism (represented by Hegel, Bradley, and particularly Bosanquet). The chapters (III and IV) on Berkeley's philosophy and its development are of great interest and should help to check the ten-</page><page sequence="3">190 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY dency to prefer praising or denouncing Berkeley to understanding him. Professor Hoernle indicates Berkeley's modernity in opposing "the bifurcation of nature" and the consequent representative theory of ideas. He makes it clear that Berkeley's ideas are objects, not modes (states or processes), of perceiving minds. But when he points to the parallel between this view and modern realistic theories of objects as classes of sense data he does not warn us of the onto- logical difference produced by Berkeley's doctrine (later explained) that all ideas are causally produced by God-that finally, indeed, there is nothing "which is real and yet not a mind or spirit" (146). Professor Hoernle criticizes the weakness of Berkeley's doctrine of active spirit (of which we have no idea); but he is inclined to save Berkeley by arguing that his "notion" of spirit is justified by what seems to him our indubitable immediate acquaintance with mind as active in perceiving ideas. Professor Hoernle seems to agree with the arguments by which Berkeley "eliminated" the concept of sub- stance "from our thinking if not from our grammar." But he does not distinguish substance as Lockeian substratum from substance in the Aristotelian sense of compound of essence and "material cause," or in the modern sense of charactered occurrence. Lockeian sub- stratum Berkeley indeed demolished (as Aristotle and others had done by anticipation), but substance as charactered occurrence Berkeley eliminated as an object of knowledge only if he proved that we perceive nothing but essence, and never events. To the re- viewer there seems to be a stronger case for the perception of oc- currence (in itself neither physical nor mental) and hence of sub- stances as more than collections of "ideas" or complexes of essences, than for the perception of mind as active in perceiving. Chapter V is mainly concerned with the philosophy of James Ward and with Professor Hoernle's objections to spiritual pluralism. It contains an interesting account of the nature and limits of proof in metaphysics. It appears to approve as a fundamental article of philosophical faith the dubious principle that "it can not be rational to believe in an irrational universe" (143). Some such article of faith prompts many more or less theodicean statements throughout the book to the effect that error, evil, and unintelligi- bility, while actual, must be factors in a total situation everyway perfect,-that suffering, for example, must be (or be capable of being transformed into) a way of salvation. The chapter also contains the astonishing comment on "mind, soul, spirit": "These three terms are always used as synonyms in philosophical discussion " (130). Unless the italics are meant to signify that "synonyms"9 is to be taken in an uncommon sense, one must wonder what Professor Hoernle does with the distinctions between vo4T and qlvx' in Plato and Aristotle, and between Geist and Seele in Hegel.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 191 Professor Hoernle gives short shrift to spiritual monism as negating all distinctions of quality. His chapter on the subject (Chap. VI) is notable for its discussion of the contradiction between the Berkeleyan and voluntarist strands in Schopenhauer's meta- physics, and of the vexed problem of matter in Bergson's account of nature in terms of the Life Urge. Chapter VII deals with Kant's critical idealism as an analysis of the way in which men mtst think if they are to know the world scientifically (179), and not merely of the way in which some men did think as a matter of fact. The problem of the extent to which Kant's analysis stands or falls with the science (especially the mathematics) of the eighteenth century is not raised. Typical of the chapter is the statement (184) "that even for ordinary common sense, let alone science, Nature is not a mere stream of sense data, but a world, a system, a whole ordered according to laws. " Whether this opinion is offered as Kant's or as Professor Hoernle's, or as the opinion of both, it needs more criticism than it gets . The questions whether nature is actually perceived "as a world," whether such necessary a priori laws as there may be are not "analytic" rather than "synthetic," whether the regularities implied by "system" are more than hopes, guesses, or more or less rough but useful averages- these questions will all have to be answered before such a view as that stated can be regarded as justified. After warning us that the categories and the unity of appercep- tion are objective, Professor Hoernle tends to seat them in "mind," but probably no more than Kant himself did. Especially valuable is his explicit account of the respects in which the Critique of Judgment (by arguing that the world may be really and thoroughly what our spiritual experience demands) leads away from Kant's metaphysical skepticism towards an idealistic ontology, The transition to the account of absolute idealism is made by an interpretation of the development from Kant to Hegel. Instead of the usual sketch which makes this development center around a few problems (like those of the Ding-an-sich or the unity of apper- ception), Professor Hoernle succeeds in giving us an impression of how Hegel 's dialectic may be understood as growing out of the whole synthetic method and tenor of Kant's work. Absolute idealism is presented as avoiding the problems of communication between spirits (so difficult for spiritual pluralism), without negating qualitative distinctions as monistic idealism is alleged to do. It leaves Kant halting at the threshold which he discovered, and, crossing, appropri- ates the mansion of positive spiritual ontology. Professor Hoernle's account of absolute idealism will be wel- comed as an excellent summary. It adds little to the position of</page><page sequence="5">192 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Bosanquet, except a convincing and needed argument that idealistic political theory does not preclude (as Bosanquet seems to have sup- posed) loyalty to political communities which transcend and in- clude "sovereign nations." Professor Hoernle 's book sets before us the great virtues of German and British Idealism. It has avoided some of the worst blind alleys of epistemology, and of Cartesian dichotomies, by taking as real (if only a phase of the whole reality) what is perceived and thought. It has striven to understand all things in the widest pos- sible context. It has insisted that the place to study mind is in its concrete history, and its fullest and richest creations. But in spite of Professor Hoernle 's sympathetic exposition, the impres- sion will remain with some readers that idealists have wrongly supposed that such virtues can only (or best) be secured by a philosophy which views spirit as ultimate and which explains the creation and maintenance of the "worlds" or "organs" (art, re- ligion, society, "nature") through which the absolute "realizes itself " by analogy with the self-transcending but self-enriching human experiences of devotion to mate, children, science, country, God. If some readers will doubt whether the full appreciation of spiritual achievements requires an idealistic metaphysics, more will doubt whether the considerations urged by Professor Hoernle make such a metaphysics probable. To the discussion (more independent than was possible in the present book) of such issues, the admirers of Professor Hoernle's Studies in Contemporary Metaphysics will hope to see him turn. The book is well printed. The reviewer has noticed only half a dozen typographical slips-one of them almost too amusing to be regretted: the ascription to the Bishop of Manchester of a book called "Men 's Creatrix" (320).
