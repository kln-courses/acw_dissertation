The fiction of a shared dream is a manner of compensating for the intrinsic loneli ness of the act of dreaming, the impossibility of even reviewing and verifying and accurately re cording what one has dreamed.43 "If you dream alone, it's just a dream./ If you dream together, it's reality," says a Brazilian folk song.44 In Vladimir Nabokov's novel Pnin, the lonely Russian emigre professor and his son Victor break through their shells of alienation by dreaming, unbeknownst to each other, the same dreams. Real life does not provide such experiences of transcendence, when unconscious meets unconscious and the awful and essential loneliness of every soul with respect to every other, is overcome. But dreaming for all its isolation is still social, since whatever another learns of it, comes by way of language and narra tive technique, and these are by their nature not isolated, but part of the culture. So when we examine a dream we are always and inevitably studying a text, hearing a narra tive. By its very nature as an expression of the unconscious, the dream is not something even the dreamer himself can ever consciously experi ence, unlike, say, a walk in the country. Even to him the dream is a recollection framed in words. And the dream itself, shaped as it is by a human mind, may itself develop around words rather as Saussure suggested certain texts do. In his Inter pretation of Dreams Sigmund Freud suggests as much: "There is no need to be astonished at the part played by words in dream-formation. Words, since they are the nodal points of numerous ideas, may be regarded as predestined to ambiguity; and the neuroses (e.g., in framing obsessions and pho bias), no less than dreams, make unashamed use of the advantages thus offered by words for pur poses of condensation and disguise."45 By using words as nodes, or as starting points of marked strings (e.g., erku &gt; erkin &gt; erkir &gt; erkn and erkner &gt; erkar·, cirani, cov &gt; ciranazgest, etc.)—which amounts to the same thing since speech is lin ear—the dreamer or narrator of a culturally signif icant dream is doing consciously in his narrative of recollection what his unconscious, if Freud is right, has probably done already. So the dream narrative has a special significance in that it is a real meeting point between those two poles of the mind, the conscious and the unconscious. Freud's insight about the propensity of words to condense and disguise—to conceal—in dreams may be extended to the activity of the dream interpreter, the Sasanian xwamnwizär, whose skill is precisely to reveal that which is inherently a veiled secret (one recalls that the Armenian word eraz, "dream," comes from Middle Iranian rfiz, "secret," in the first place). The dreams of Asty ages are nightmares, crises—and it is just at times of crisis in a society that the esoteric is violated and unveiled, that apocalypses are advertised and proclaimed. The otherworldly and symbolic be comes actual. The dreams we have examined belong to cycles of epic,· and the events of epic lie inherently in a closed and completed past he roic age. In Psalm 126, the children of Israel sing, Be-süvä Adonai et slvat Tsiyyön hayylnü ke hölemim/ Äz yemäle sehöq plnü ü-lesönenü ilnä, "When the Lord returned the captivity of Zion we were as dreamers:/ Then our mouths were filled with laughter; and our tongues, with song." But in the post-heroic era of a long, dark exile Yehuda Halevi, determined as he was to return home, could no longer connect the unconscious arche type of the imaginal world to the realia of poetic speech: Be-süv sevüt Tsiyyön häyä ke-hölem/ Ü-be-heqltsö en pötei halömö, "At the return of Zion he was as a dreamer -J And at his waking there is no interpreter of his dream." Dream is a lesser form of prophecy; and the gates of prophecy are closed. There may be no remedy for the lone liness of the soul. The heroic age may be sealed in an infinitely receding past, since nobody alive ever saw it. The gates of prophecy are closed: we may speak decorously to God in a temple, but if we aver that God also speaks to us, we will soon be speaking to doctors. Yet art, as Friedrich Nietz sche declared, saves us from the truth. So hopes of revelation, of union, of return, are delivered through dream in the artifice of written fiction. One way or another, suffering humanity finds its opiate,· and the creative artist, the delight of in vention and the glory of poetic speech.46 Notes 1. J.

Russell, "Some Iranian Images of Kingship in the Armenian Artaxiad Epic," Revue des Etudes Armeniennes 20 (1986-1987), pp. 253-70, repr. AIS, pp. 157-74. It contains several of the word-images of the hymn of the birth of Vahagn: cux, "smoke"; vazel "run"; and p'oh, here a fluted pipe as "trumpet" rather than "stalk." These may be fortu itous, but at the least it may be suggested that they are small signals of the stock vocabulary of a single large epic cycle. 10. On the relationship of the Armenian epic cycles to the Nartee, with a specific case of borrowing from Armenian, see most recently f. R.

The name of the mythical "sea of wide shores" Vourukasa is rendered into the Sanskrit translation of the Avesta as ksirasamudra-, "milky sea," as Prof. Martin Schwartz has noted; and the mythical seas of shamans of the Hindu Kush are milky, too. This would suggest either that Iranian tradition acquired this addi tional mythological and folkloric dimension, reflected in medieval Zoroastrian learning, or that the Sanskrit term is a window into a very ancient topos either shared by Iranians and their neighbors or, more likely, diffused into Iran and eastwards from ancient Anato lia. The singular abundance of Armenian and Kurdish references to magical milky springs makes the latter suggestion attractive. It is, however, just as possible that various cultures look back to a paradisiacal pri mordial age when the seas were as sweet and nourish ing as mother's milk, rather than cold, salty, stormy, and dark—and human imagination in divers times and places acted similarly in shaping the archetype of this facet of mythical geography. 12. In much the same way Arm. jeiba-kal, "arrest," lit. "have by the hand," possibly a caique upon Middle Iranian dast-graw-, describes how captors lead their prisoners on Iranian bas-reliefs. 13.

Arm. patuhas-em, from Mir. pätifräs-, will have had at this time the sense of severe interrogation, ap propriate to their dread interview. The translations are mine; but one may consult the monumental transla tion and study by N. G. Garsoi'an, The Epic Histories (Buzandaran Patmut'iwnk'), Harvard Armenian Texts and Studies 8 (Cambridge, Mass., 1989). The suggestion that Arm. *buzand means "epic history" rests upon the inherently unstable foundation of a hypothetical compound word in Iranian proposed by Prof. Anahit Perikhanian. Though her suggestion may be right, one cannot dismiss on present evidence the simpler and traditional derivation from "Byzantine"—and Faustus is certainly not an Armenian name! 20. The Armenians, according to Xorenac'i, traced their legendary descent to, among others, Paroyr Skay ordi, i.e., "Partatua ("Able in battle") the Scythian's Son." This would argue for a secure etymology of skay or hskay, "giant," from "Scythian." Were a derivation from Ir. kavi-, as Prof. Martin Schwartz has suggested in correspondence, to be sought, one might expect the earlier, and northwestern, Mir. kaw to be the form en tering Armenian. We may indeed encounter it in the ancient toponym Kavakert (kav seems to be the com mon noun "clay" in other place names with the ele ment, e.g., Kavablur "Clay Hill," that are attested only in recent times), see Τ'. X. Hakobyan et al., Hayastani ev harakic' srfanneri tekanunneri bararan [Dictionary 74</page><page sequence="19">russell: Magic Mountains, Milky Seas, Dragon Slayers, and Other Zoroastrian Archetypes of the toponyms of Armenia and contiguous regions], vol. 2 (Erevan, 1988), p. 965 s.v. 21. On the two books, see M. Boyce, "Middle Per sian Literature," Handbuch der Orientalistik 1.4.2.1 (Leiden, 1968), pp. 54, 63. 22. Students of epic generally follow Aristotle and note the hubris of the tragic hero; but less attention is paid to those who hubrizontai, are "hubrissed," as it were. Yet the flogging of the hero to be, his toiling down in the stables rather than riding up on the back of a war horse, are elements that we meet again and again, from Josephus and Sasanian epic and Talmudic tale down to the frame narrative of the 17th-century Anatolian Robin Hood—Köroglu, "Son of the Blind Man." The latter, cel ebrated in epic tales and balladry in Turkic, in Iranian dialects, and in Armenian, even in Modem Greek, is an epic that, as Haig Berberian long ago discerned, sprang from the soil and legend of Arsacid Armenia. The hero of such an epic of the dispossessed and the downtrodden will have a beginning as formulaic in its evocation of the images of oppression and humiliation as the praise songs of the upper classes. 23. Would smiting the sledded Polacks on the ice be an echo of irony? 24. See S.

C. Allison et al. (Wiesba den, 2009), pp. 141-208, pp. 142, 187: the Russian text might originally have been called glubinnaia, "deep"; golubinaia, "of the dove," would be a lectio facilior supported by association with the image of the Holy Spirit. It is a mysterious book, too; and in Armenian a famous cryptogram is called ahawnagir, "the writing of the dove," an additional association attractive for the presumed change of title: see f. R.

During a recent visit to Jerusalem I noted this Armeno-Talmudic parallel to my former pupil, Prof. Geoffrey Herman, who, I was happy to learn, had seen it too: his work on Irano-Talmudica is rich in precisely these illuminating details. The Hebrew word ethrog is not likely to be native, and is probably a loan from an Iranian term ending in -anJ and originally denoting a sweet lime or the like. A raw citron would be a rather unpleasant fruit to consume, and certainly not fit for the likes of the Res Galütä and Particeps Siderum. 29.

Russell, "The Rime of the Book of the Dove (Stikh ο Golubinoi knige): From Zoroastrian Cosmology and Armenian Heresiography to the Rus sian Novel," cited above. Among the various Russian sectarians—the Dukhobors, who preserve a long ver sion of the Rime of the Book of the Dove, are among these—are the Molokan (lit. "Milk-drinker") Pryguny, or Jumpers, practitioners of an ecstatic and esoteric type of Christianity who reject icons and crosses, con demn the eating of pork and baptism in water, regard military service as anathema, and celebrate the Sab bath on Saturday. They endured vicious persecutions at the hands of the Tsars, the police, and the Ortho dox Church; but were allowed by Nicholas I in 1839 to settle in the Russian Transcaucasus and Armenia, building little villages like Nadezhdino and Alexan drovka, Konstantinovka and Sukhoi Fontan, in the districts of Erevan and Alexandropol, of Kars and Dili jan. They revered the snowy summit of Mt. Ararat as "mother of all the world"; and some of the surviving Armenian sectarians—Paulicians, Tondrakites—joined their number. I have met one of these, a woman whose family left Russia for Los Angeles at the turn of the 20th century. She now lives in Mevasseret Tsiyyon, a town near Jerusalem, Israel; and in December 2009 she showed me the English-language Molokan lectionary and source book printed in California in 1983, a trans lation from the Russian Dukh i zhizn': kniga solntsa ("Spirit and Life: Book of the Sun"), 1928: Divine Dis courses of the Preceptors and Martyrs for the Word of God, the Faith of Jesus, and the Holy Spirit of the Religion of the Spiritual Christian Molokan-Jumpers, on pp. 172-73 of which is the testimony of one of the leaders of the sect, Maxim Gavrilovich Rudometkin (ca. 1818-1877, b. Morshansk, Tambov region, Russia): "This [revelation] I myself clearly saw in the rapture of my true Spirit, and heard concerning it discourses from the God of gods, on an occasion during some un known time when I was unexpectedly transported to a vast and immeasurable airy field, or in other words, to a foggy sea, not yet inhabited by anyone. 2. And upon it I stood alone. And there I suddenly saw close to me two Gods walking, both appearing in the image of man, Who now came straight to me and greeted me in Their dignity. 3. And hereupon they began first to tell me of Themselves—Who They both were and what Their de velopments had been since the beginning: 4. Who of Them was the primary Omnipotent, and Who namely was derived gradually from Whom—as was needful. 5. I ask the reader to see this more clearly further on in this very book of mine, which from the first word will reveal to you all that is needed in full. 6. And this is the reason I have delivered this book to the public, so that each reader and listener could obtain the power of the knowledge of the mystery concerning the God of gods and the God of all men, and God the Spirit Which emanates from Them both. 7. And wherein this mutual spirit of theirs is ever dividing itself into two classes, amongst both Angels and men under the name: clean and unclean spirit. 8. And thus these two spirits everywhere without interruption wage war and battle between themselves under the leadership of their chief authorities, who are Alfeyil [Jesus Christ, n.[ and Leb eyil [the devil, n.[, or, in short, light and darkness. 9. Therein the God of gods, their Father God Himself, allowed them both to fight it out from the beginning and until the end of the age, manifestly using angels and men. 10. He who desires and does good obeys the Spirit of truth; he who desires and does evil obeys the spirit of deceit. 11. This is why it is here necessary to note that since before the ages, using these two lead ers and their spirits, the God of gods Himself governs and judges each according to his works. 12. He Himself committed all to both these leaders and their spirits to eternally judge and lead all men, the good and the evil alike, each according to his worth, during this age and the one hereafter. Amen." The vision of a dualistic cos mogony corresponds, thus, to the old oral ballad about the Book of the Dove that Molokans also recited. So Rudometkin's narrative either is a dream inspired by the ballad, a visionary dream independent from it, or a literary recasting of the ballad presented in the form of a dream retold. In his book on glossolalia, Tongues of Men and Angels (New York, 1972), pp. 184-85 and n. 6), W. J. Samarin, a Los Angeles native, mentions that the Armenian Shakarian family came to America as "Pentecostals": they were presumably Molokans, who were accepted simply as "Russian Pentecostals" by American Pentecostal Christians. 36. Or is it? The American Jewish poet and prose writer from Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, Delmore Schwartz (d. 1966), became famous with his short story (and poem with a similar title) "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities," in which the narrator dreams on the eve of his twenty-first birthday that he is watch ing a movie of his parents' courtship. He shouts at the figures on the screen to stop, and warns them their chil dren will be monsters; but an usher in the theater ad monishes him that he cannot always do what he wants to do. The story, written in the late 1930's employs art fully the images of what was still the relatively new medium of film and introduces into the mainstream of American letters Freudian concerns with the uncon scious and neurosis and the overheated emotions of Jewish family life from which they had sprung. The idea that one is in fact responsible for one's dreams as their author, even though one is also a passive observer, even a victim, of their progress, is an unsettling paradox. It reminds one of the paradox of the individual as both maker and helpless sufferer of the sardonic twists of his tory that T. S. Eliot—who first discovered and promoted Schwartz—outlines in his poem "Gerontion," which Schwartz has his character read aloud in another story and movie theater, "Screeno." It seems a long way back 76</page><page sequence="21">russell: Magic Mountains, Milky Seas, Dragon Slayers, and Other Zoroastrian Archetypes to Azdahak; but the latter has through his corruption and villainy set the stage for the destruction he fore sees in his dream, so some of his terror must be sudden, tragic self-knowledge. The Christian idea of original sin makes such responsibility despite unconsciousness a matter of cosmic and universal guilt, which can be ab solved only by the radical catharsis of magic involving the deep taboos of human sacrifice and cannibalism (the Crucifixion and Holy Communion). 37.

Lovecraft (d. 1937), a student of Near Eastern myth and of Poe, has a god imprisoned in a sealed cave in a city beneath the sea—like Mher in the Carved Rock, or God in the seventh chamber of the heavenly Hekhalöt—summon his faithful through dreams. "The Call of Cthulhu" and submarine R'lyeh seem terrifying, as all apocalypses are; but beyond the fear is liberation and ecstasy. So in "The Shadow over Innsmouth" a young man discovers he is one with the terrifying beings under the ocean, and at first recoils from the sickening realization. Yet in his dreams the watery city of Yha-n'thlei appears to him, his earlier fear turns to wonder, and he resolves to return to this antipode of Zion's mount—boldly to offer his dream of return a practical explanation and to dive beneath the waves to dwell in glory forever. Lovecraft's use of his own dreams in his work, and his deft ma nipulation of mythological topoi and archetypes, has so captivated readers in a culture, most of whose literary sophisticates are disdainful of modern epic, consider ing it retrograde and even puerile (cf. Edmund Wilson's contemptuous dismissal of Tolkien) that some believe his inventions to be realities rather as evangelicals may believe in the literal truth of Scripture.

Martirosyan of Leiden University for his careful read ing of the draft of this paper, which saved one from sev eral embarrassing errors.
