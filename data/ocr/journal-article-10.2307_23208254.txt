Two of the essays explore religious subjec tivity through a focus on spirit possession among Black Chicago residents and the Punu of Congo-Brazzaville respectively. We learn from the paper on Predynastic Egyptian figurines that some Dynastic religious beliefs and ico nography can be traced back to prehistorical Nilotic rituals. Finally, the essay on Swahili weddings addresses the role of Islamic knowledge in coastal Swahili women's lives through a focus on women's roles as sex instructors. Elizabeth Perez's essay offers a sophisticated analysis of Spiritist rituals among Black North American practitioners of Afro-Cuban religion through a focus on the practices through which devotees access the voices of their ances tors. Scholars of Afro-Atlantic religion concerned about the Africanity of Black practices have ignored Espiritismo on the basis that it offers limited evi dence of cultural 'retentions'. Yet Pérez argues that for the Chicago-based Lucurm community she studied, spiritist misas, which include spirit posses sion, provide access to forms of knowledge and understandings of history through which participants create connections to a communal African past, thereby generating a distinctive Afro-Atlantic religious subjectivity. Whereas Yoruba revisionists working to divest Orisha worship of its contaminating European elements dismiss misas as inauthentic, practitioners see them as an essential tool for the affirmation of their authentic' Africanity. Far from 'whitening' participants' identities, the presence of gospel songs, church hymns, and spirituals in misas turns Espiritismo into a vital mode of constitut ing Blackness. Central to Pérez's approach is an attempt to move beyond the rhetoric of resistance and accommodation that has guided studies of spirit possession and focus instead on the substantive content of misas, regardless of their potential for articulating social critiques. Carine Plancke's nuanced account of spirit possession in rural Congo Brazzaville documents how the Punu exalt female regenerative capacities as a basis for cosmic renewal in the context of celebrations dedicated to the bayisi, water spirits that ensure people's prosperity and continuity. Through singing and dancing, female performers activate an opening of the mind' that Punu women believe is essential to initiating the process of communing with the © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011 DOI: 10.1163/157006611X615209</page><page sequence="2">328 Editorial / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 327-329 water spirit world. In this respect, Plancke suggests, the concept of receptivity provides a more useful analytical lens for exploring Punu experiences of pos session trance than the notion of agency, which is problematically wedded to Western liberal ideas of autonomy and resistance. For Punu women, power resides in the capacity to activate a physical opening to the spirit and the subsequent revelation of the spirits wish. In recent times elements of the bayisi cult have been adopted by the Congolese church of Zéphirin Lassy after originally being rejected on the basis that they were a form of sorcery. Following their integration into the church, spirit possession performances have been radically altered. Rather than being conceived as collective celebra tions of women's regenerative power, they now promote individual healing, and the ambivalence that characterized people's relations to the spirits has been overshadowed by a Manichean vision of the world. Joan Relke's essay revisits Peter Ucko's interpretation of Predynastic Egyp tian figurines and presents a compelling case for the reconsideration of these anthropomorphic or therianthropic representations as religious objects. Challenging the prevailing view that they represented a universally worshiped supreme female deity, Ucko argued fifty years ago that these figurines—made of a variety of materials including baked clay—were secular representations, likely used, among other things, as dolls, talismanic pregnancy aids, or tools for sex instruction and puberty rites. Mobilizing archaeological, historical, and ethnographic evidence that establishes continuities between Predynastic, Dynastic, and contemporary religious practices, Relke argues that the figu rines found in graves must have been manufactured for mortuary purposes and were used in death rituals. When examined in conjunction with ethno graphic accounts of modern Nuer and Dinka people, the anthropomorphic figurines with raised arms can be viewed as mimicking the horns of cattle, sug gesting that cattle were as central to the spirituality of Predynastic populations as they were to the Nilotic societies studied by E.E. Evans-Pritchard and Godfrey Lienhardt. They also point to a connection with the Dynastic concepts of Ka (vital force) and Ba (soul). When considered in light of the Dynastic view of birds as spiritual mediators between death and the afterlife, the figurines with beaked faces further suggest that Predynastic Egyptians believed in the existence of life after death. As elements of Predynastic escha tology, the various human and beaked-faced figurines examined by Relke indi cate that Dynastic notions of life in the underworld were already present in the Predynastic period. Katrina Thompsons illuminating discussion of the sex instruction that Swahili brides receive during their weddings makes a valuable contribution to scholarly debates about the relevance of Islam in Muslim women's lives and</page><page sequence="3">Editorial / Journal of Religion in Africa 41 (2011) 327-329 329 the role of Swahili traditions in Islamic practice. Contradicting the prevailing view that women on the Swahili Coast are more concerned with tradition than with religion, Thompson insists that Islam and Muslim practice are cen tral to women's discourse about sex and marriage during weddings. Indeed, she goes so far as to say that the uniqueness of Swahili sex instruction, which draws on orthodox interpretations of Islamic marriage, law, and sexuality, may well reside in its contribution to Swahili Islam. This is not to say, of course, that women are not constrained by social expectations and local understand ings of gendered roles. The point, nevertheless, is that women are actively engaged in transmitting Islamic knowledge in contexts that are not regulated by dominant ideologies. In so doing, they establish themselves as religious authorities. Yet, ultimately, the authority they gain does not affect the status quo. Knowledgeable about Islam as they may be, Swahili women neither ques tion the position of women in society nor challenge established hierarchies. By drawing on new sources of evidence, offering fresh analytical perspec tives, and proposing innovative approaches to classical problems—spirit possession, the afterlife, Islamic knowledge—these essays demonstrate the vibrancy and diversity of the study of religion in Africa and beyond.</page></plain_text>
