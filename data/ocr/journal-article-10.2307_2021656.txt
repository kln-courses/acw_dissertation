<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSALITY AND PERCEPTION' H UME has shown that " causation" is not found among the con- tents of sense perception. This is incontrovertible when perception is understood, as Kant in his acceptance of Hume's I Read at the Forty-sixth Annual Meeting of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association at Qhtrk University, Worcester, Mass., l)Pcember, 1949,</page><page sequence="2">320 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY negative result understood it, as mere receptivity which registers the data of sensation. And if this again is taken-as Hume and Kant implicitly took it-to be the only mode in which externality is originally "given" (so that even of our own bodily activity we know only by our receptivity, whose sequential data have then to be interpreted in terms of action), then indeed causality must be some mental addition to the raw material of prime givenness. Now, while Hume's argument concerning the non-givenness of causation in perception stands unabated, his account of its origin in the mechanics of ideas does not. Neither does Kant's alterna- tive, since reason by itself no more yields the notion of action and influence than does the sense perception of Hume's description. But perhaps the problem lies in the very fact which Hume and Kant accepted as ultimate: the causal muteness of percepts. If this itself is taken as a matter for explanation, as it should be, an in- teresting inversion of Hume's problem suggests itself: Consider- ing what we know about the causality involved in the genesis of sense perception itself, its de-causalized content presents a par- ticular riddle which sharpens Hume's more general riddle into the paradox that a specific causal nexus-affection of the senses,- should terminate in its own presentational suppression as part of its specific performance. This disowning of its genesis by the perceptive mode, i.e., the terminal obliteration of its own causal character, forms an essential feature of what Whitehead calls "presentational immediacy," and is the condition of its objective function which is thus bought at a price. The inversion of the problem here suggested presupposes an independent and legitimate source of causal knowledge whose de- liverance is not affected by the negative fihdings of perception; on the contrary it has to be drawn upon for the explanation of per- ception itself no less than for the supplementation of its findings. Whitehead 's distinction of "causal efficacy" and " presenta- tional immediacy" as belonging to two modes of perception offers an important clue with respect to Hume's problem, but beyond its statement no sufficient explanation of itself (in fact the term "immediacy" is apt to mislead). Following up this clue, this paper proposes to show: (a) how it is that the several senses, in differing degrees, eliminate the imprint of their own causal constitution from the integration of their imagery; (b) why the sacrifice of the causal element extends from the self-presentation of the actual perceiving mode to its general object picture, coin- ciding with the range of "objectivity" as such, which is thus real- ity de-natured but would not be possible otherwise; (c) why the objectifying modes so constituted have of necessity come to monop-</page><page sequence="3">CAUSALITY AND PERCEPTION 321 olize the concept of knowledge, and their object type that of real- ity, thereby creating problems peculiar to this self-curtailment (inter alia the problem of "necessary connection"). (a) How do the senses come to deliver a de-causalized content? A complete answer involves an analysis of the senses at once ge- netic and phenomenological: the latter alone would commit itself from the outset to the face value of perceptional testimony and thus not escape from the magic circle of Hume's argument. Lack of time confines us to a few remarks indicating the line of rea- soning. The smallness (in dimension, time rate, and energy) of the unit- actions and reactions involved in affection of the senses, i.e., their minute scale relative to the organism, permits their mass-integra- tion into one continuous and homogeneous effect (impression) in which not only the single impulses are absorbed, but the charac- ter of impulse as such is largely cancelled and replaced by that of detached image. Where qualities are perceived, the raw ma- terial is action: impacts, hustlings, clashes on a molecular scale. Organisms not far exceeding that scale can therefore have no per- ception, but the collision experience only. Theirs would be a world not of presences but of incidences, or, not of existences but of forces. To the large-scale organism, on the other hand, when having the force-experience in interaction on its own scale, this is always already attended and surrounded by the perceptive tran- scripts of the small-scale influences which, by reason of their effort- less, continuous presence, seem to furnish the neutral substratum of being, to which the force-relation happens to be added on par- ticular occasions. This is an inversion of the original ontological order, and the root of a theoretical problem of causality later on. The degree to which the dynamical relationship is or is not per- ceptible and represented in the perception itself, and the degree to which sequence of happening is translated into simultaneous- ness of a statical presence, can serve to classify the senses with respect to their objectifying function. From a comparative anal- ysis, sight emerges as the sense with the most complete neutraliz- ing of dynamic content and the most unambiguous distancing of its object from the perceptive function. In degrees, the self- effacement of causal efficacy takes place in all sense perception: where violence of the stimulus forces the threshold and causality floods sensation, there sense perception is ousted by the experi- ence of impact or by pain, i.e., it ceases to be perception proper. Especially in touch, the transition from apprehension of quality to experience of pressure and thence to exercise of power is a matter of traceable degrees. Or to exemplify from another sense:</page><page sequence="4">322 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY in the case of a detonation nearby, the force acting on our re- ceptor may exceed the acoustic limits and instead of just hearing a sound of particular quality and intensity, we feel assaulted by power, to be sustained and resisted by power. Thus the world, instead of presenting itself, can intrude dynamically into its testi- mony, its causality overwhelming perception. The latter is there- fore constitutionally bound to the former 's exclusion from ac- count-at least in relation to itself-and fulfills its specific task by performing just this feat. In the case of vision, the feat is made possible to perfection by the dynamical properties of light and the relative orders of magnitude involved. The seeming in- activity and selfcontainedness of the seen object corresponds to the seeming inactivity and selfcontainedness of the spectator; yet both characters are the purified result of a particular set of con- necting activity. Its total elimination from the presentational result, which gains by losing but loses nevertheless, introduces an element of abstraction-the abstraction of image-into the very constitution of sense perception, hence into object knowledge as such. (b) The suppression of object-subject causality in perception entails that of object-object causality too-or that of causality pure and simple within the "theoretical" (= perceptional) do- main to which the intrinsic testimony of subject-object causality as aware of itself in man's active intercourse with things is not admitted as evidence (i.e., not before itself having been subjected to perceptual objectivation, its contents transformed into serial data). By the rejection of this evidence, which has its own story, understanding deprives itself of the one non-perceptive source, the force-experience of my own body in action, which could by analogy still supply the dynamical links in the sequence of ob- served events: these, having become objects by disconnection from the reality of the observer, stand thereby stripped of that char- acter which would explain also their connectedness among them- selves. The detachment of objectivation left them detached from each other as well. The character generally suppressed is force which, being not a "datum" but an "actum," can not be "seen," i.e., objectified, but only experienced from within when exerted or suffered. The primary neutralization of this character by per- ception, which changes actualities into data, is bequeathed to the concepts of the understanding which rises from this very basis of objectivation. Understanding by itself, when left to deal with the stripped percepts- alone, can not restore that character nor compensate for it by its own means of connection (here again Hume was right-and Kant wrong). But enjoying the advantages of</page><page sequence="5">CAUSALITY AND PERCEPTION 323 disconnection in the subject-object relation, namely, the freedom of theory, it has to accept its disadvantages as regards object-ob- ject relation. (c) Abscondence of causal efficacy is the price by which presen- tation of being by itself, and consequently objectivity, are gained. On the credit side, effacement of causality means disengagement from it. Perception as such, and vision particularly, secure that standing back from causal involvement which frees for observa- tion and opens a hotizon for elective attention. The object, stay- ing in its bounds, faces the subject across the gap which the evanescence of the force context has created. From the onrush and impact of reality, out of its insistent proximity in influence, the distance of appearance (phenomenon) is won: image, in the place of effect, can be looked at and compared, in memory retained and recalled, in imagination varied and freely composed. This separation of contained appearance from intrusive reality, the original feat of perception, gives rise to the separableness of es- sentia from existentia underlying the higher freedoms of theory. It is but the basic freedom of vision, and the element of abstrac- tion inherent in image, which are carried farther in conceptual thought; and from perception, concept and idea inherit that onto- logical pattern of objectivity it has primarily created. The still- ness of object, withdrawn from the turmoil of forces, recurs en- hanced in the stableness and permanent availabillty of idea: it is in the last analysis at the bottom of "theory" as such. It follows that the dominance in epistemology of the cognitive modes derived from perception-a dominance pushed historically to the exclu- sion of other modes of acquaintance with reality-is intimately bound up with the possibility of knowledge as such: so is the cor- responding dominance in ontology of their object pattern. The exclusiveness, however, has its penalty. On the debit side, the same gap between subject and object which provides the dimension of freedom for theory, and which is found duplicated in the gap between object and object, provides in both respects also the breeding ground for a class of problems which beset the history of knowledge-unavoidable because rooted in its very conditions, and by the same token insoluble within those conditions. As regards object-object relation, an epistemo- logical case in point is Hume's problem of necessary connection, as a substitute for real causality (and in this devitalized form taken over by Kant). In its ontological version, the problem of relation revolves around the classical concept of selfcontained, inactive substance-' 'that which requires nothing but itself in order to exist" (Descartes)-which is by no means an histori-</page><page sequence="6">324 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY cal freak, but the conceptual framing of perceptive truth. The homelessness of "force" in the system raises the issue of "an- thropomorphism," whose banishment from exterior knowledge is far too much taken for granted as the proper thing in scientific epistemology. As regards subject-object relation, the gulf opened by perceptive objectivation in sole command is partly responsible for those puzzles of the consciousness-external world dualism which parallelism, occasionalism, idealism have in vain attempted to solve. I can here but enumerate the problems originating in the perceptive situation and made over to the reflection of theory. In the case of all of them, an original freedom of animal life, per- ception-itself an offshoot of the more basic freedom of organic being as such-presents its bill in the yet higher freedom of thought. Conclusions. Reverting to Hume's issue we find: that his re- sult, the non-givenness of causation among percepts, is only what is to be expected from the nature and meaning of perception itself; that the result, in being confirmed, is at the same time limited to its proper field and thereby divested of its sceptical implications; that what calls for explanation in the first place is not how, from the causal vacuum of perception, we still come to the idea of cau- sation, but how it is that perception does not exhibit it, i.e., con- trives to conceal it, its absence there and not its presence among our ideas being the puzzling fact; that the primary aspect of causality is not regular connection, not even necessary connection, but force and influence; that these are themselves original contents of experience and not interpolations between contents of experi- ence (= percepts) by a synthetic function, be it association or rea- son; that the source of this experience is, indeed, not sense per- ception, but our body exerting itself in action-the source which Hume summarily dismisses under the head of "animal nisus"; that, lastly, the right of extrapolation from this source beyond its immediate range of deliverance is a question to be studied, without fear of the blame of anthropomorphism, by an organic philosophy.
