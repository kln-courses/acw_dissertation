Los restos de una estructura prehispânica y 15 sitios con vestigios culturales vinculados a la navegacion han sido localizados por inves tigadores mexicanos en torno a un barco hundido de posible origen britânico en las costas de Champotön, Campeche. La arqueöloga Pilar Luna Erreguerena, titular de la Subdirecciön de Arqueologia Subacuâtica, informé que los especialistas hallaron restos de embarcaciones y dragas de finales del siglo XIX y del XX. Durante el registro arqueolégico del navio, ubicado en 2004, se han detectado en la embarcacién seis canones de très calibres diferentes, una bala, una piedra de afilar y varias piedras de lastre. Se efectué una serie de actividades que incluyé el registro - mediante dibujo, fotografia y video - del naufragio descubierto hace dos anos. Se hizé un levantamiento detallado del sitio, que les ha permitido conjeturar que se trata de una embarcacién de nacionalidad britânica. Conocido entre los pobladores del lugar como El Pesquero, el navio localizado a 20 kilometros de la costa, a una profundidad de ocho métros. Cercano a la zona, en el punto conocido como El Cuyo, se registro ademâs la existencia de una estructura prehispânica con notable deterioro a orillas del Rio Champotön. The Maya ruins of Primera Seccion, Chiapas, Mexico Graz (Karl Herbert Mayer). In the vast region of the Selva Lacandona and adjacent areas in the Mexican state of Chiapas there are many ancient Maya ruins with carved stone monu ments bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions. Known sites with carved monumental texts are, for example, Palenque, Xupa, Chuctiepa, Miraflores, La Mar, El Cayo, El Chicozapote, Yaxchilan, Ojos de Agua, Oxlahuntun, Bonampak, Lacanha, San Lorenzo, and Tzendales, all known for many decades. In recent times additional sites with inscribed monuments have been discovered, including El Palma (Velâzquez Valadez 1986) Ayaxchilan FRONTERA- Ä COROZAL •BETHEL • SAN JAVIER LACANHAA ▲ USUUA CINTA JÊL BONAMPAK RIVER PRIMERA SECCION A BENEMERtTO DE IAS AMERICAS • AIÛEA PRIMERA SECCION RIO DE LA PAS ION SALINAS LACAN TVN RIVER RIVER Fig. 1.

Primera Seccion, Altar 1, front surface (Photo by K. H. Mayer, 2006) and Dos Caobas (Tovalin Ahumada et. al. 1998). Frans Blom and Gertrude Duby ( 1957:231-244) have published an impor tant list of Maya sites in the Sel va Lacandona, which originally occupied an area of about 12,000 square km. Susanna M. Ekholm (1992) has published an updated general overview of the archaeology of this area in the general Usumacinta region and provides a useful map, showing the location of 75 archaeo logical sites. Today the name Selva Lacandona is misleading, as two-thirds of the original jungle and rain forest have been destroyed and replaced by pastures and agricultural fields. In March of2003, in the course of visits to several archaeo logical Maya sites in Chiapas, Christian Heck, Bonn, Germany, engaged a native guide at the bridge of Boca Lacantun, Chiapas, in order to inspect and take photographs of the famous rock carvings of Planchon de las Figuras (Garcia Moll 1986; Juarez Cossfo 1994) in the Ri'o Lacantun region of the Selva Lacandona. This guide provided the information regard Li*y Fig. 3. Primera Seccion, Altar 1, top surface (Photo by K. H. Mayer, 2006) 64 Fig. 4. Primera Seccion, Stela 1 (Photo by K. H. Mayer, 2006) ing an unnamed site with stone monuments near the small village of Primera Secciön, located north of the modern town of Benemérito de las Américas. One day later, Heck visited these ruins, at this time guided by a young resident from Primera Secciön, and found there many carved Maya stone sculptures, several of them bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions. He took a series of digital colour photographs of the ruins and their surroundings and of the carved monuments. He wrote a brief, hitherto unpublished manuscript describing the ruins and its sculptures (Heck 2005). In this report Heck states that the ruins are located on a natural hill approximately 1 km from the village. The medium-sized ruins have in the centre an approximately twelve metres high pyramid with partially pre served stone walls. In front of this structure is a collapsed hieroglyphic stairway with largely destroyed inscriptions. Moreover, there are several sculptured stelae, one of them in Fig. 5. Primera Section, Stela 1, narrow side with design (Photo by K. H. Mayer, 2006) Vol. XXVIII • August 2006</page><page sequence="3">rather good condition. No tunnels excavated by looters were seen, but it can be suspected that loggers have looted the better stelae portions. Various larger altars exhibit traces of carvings. There is a slightly higher second pyramidal structure with partly standing walls on another hill, but without in scribed monuments. Heck's photographs, primarily taken with a flash, show some of the carved sculptures, including a fragmentary and shattered stela with a pointed top, portraying on its front an obviously anthropomorphic figure adorned with plumes and on the right lateral surface several isolated glyph-blocks. One of the other monuments shows an appar ently very long inscription, but the carved surface is severely eroded. Most of the carvings have been vandalized and the contours of the bas-reliefs show recent scratchings and trac ings, obviously made with a machete. One stone has a new scratching representing a modern personal name. On March 11, 2006, Karl Herbert Mayer of the staff of mexicon, visited briefly the ruins of Primera Seccion, which were easy to find with the written directions furnished by Heck. The best starting point to see the ruins is the town of Beneméritode las Américas ( 16° 31.10' N, 90° 38.88' W), close to the Rio Usumacinta, which is connected with the town of Palenque on an approximately 195 km long pavedroad. North of Benémerito de las Américas, at km 179.5 there is an unpaved roadleading to th caldea (village) of Primera Seccion, pertain ing to the municipality of Ocosingo. The distance from Benemérito de las Américas to the village is 5.3 kmin a straight line. According to local residents, this community was founded around 35 years ago. Its geographical coordinates are: 16° 34.30' N, 90° 40.23' W. The ruins are veryclose, 1.2 km as the parrot flies, and south to the village and this location was determined with a hand-held GPS receiver which gave the following readings: 16° 38.64' N, 90° 40.23' W (Fig. 1). The village is surrounded by milpas; the main crops are maize and chili. Of the original forest only a few corozo palm trees remain. The ruins are situated on an elevated hilly terrain where remnants of the original rain forest survive, including mahagony and Spanish cedar trees. In the village it was not possible to find a guide because most of the people where engaged in the harvest of chili fruits. When approaching the forest-covered steep hill with the ruins via a dirt road between fenced-in fields, a group of howler monkeys were heard. Without a guide and a machete access to the heavily wooded area with the ancient Maya ruins was not an easy task and the thick underbrush and lack of newly-cut trails prevented the easy locating of masonry structures and monuments. In a few mounds recent excavations by looters or loggers were seen. At one place one of the larger holes was approximately 2 m deep. During a very brief stay, lasting not more than one hour, in the densely overgrown ruins several plain and carved monuments were observed and six of them were photographed. Photography was difficult due to the darkness caused by high trees and thick vegetation. Only two monumental carvings were measured. A very interesting limestone sculpture, preliminarily des ignated as "Altar 1 is a rectangular limestone block with three glyphs on the vertical front surface (Fig. 2) and carvings on the top (Fig. 3). The surfaces are covered with greenish microflora, obscuring much of the carved details. This altar is possibly in its original position and is 35 cm high, 84 cm wide, and 67 cm long. The maximum relief depth is 3 cm. The inscription on the Fig. 6. Primera Section, stone block with possible glyphic design (Photo by K. H. Mayer, 2006) Fig. 7. Primera Seccion, carved stone block (Photo K. H. Mayer, 2006) Igg^gl^ Fig. 8. Primera Seccion, carved stone block (Photo K. H. Mayer, 2006) on the front shows in one cartouche two glyph-blocks render ing a calendrical statement, identified by Christian Prager of the University of Bonn as " 16 Tun, 1 K'atun". There is also another eroded glyph-block to the right of the date. The top of the altar has a large round design in the centre. Bar and dot elements indicate that it is a glyph compound bearing a calendrical statement. Two deep grooves connected with the circle-shaped glyph compound lead to the edge of the top surface and on one side is apparently another round glyph block. mexicon • Vol. XXVIII • August 2006</page><page sequence="4">Another monument, preliminarily called "Stela 1", is 130cm high, 52 cm wide,33 cm deep, and its maximum relief depth is 2.5 cm. The incomplete limestone sculpture has carvings at least on one broader (front ?) side (Fig. 4) and on a narrow side. The eroded front has again the striking feature of the curious circle-and-double groove carving and at least one glyph block. The unusual carved design on the lateral side shows geometrical elements (Fig. 5). Three other monolithic blocks, perhaps elements of a stairway, all showing the specific and inexplicable circles-and-grooves design, were found close together (Figs. 6-8). Several other sculptures were observed in the ruins. Sur prisingly, however, none of the objects photographed by Heck three years ago. Moreover, the two pyramids seen by Heck could not be found. This fact makes it obvious that Heck and Mayer visited different parts of the same archaeological site and this means that the corpus of carved stone sculptures is definitely larger and more substantial than previously ex pected. The unnamed ruins are given preliminarily the name of the nearby village in order to avoid an invented name of the site. It is desirable that the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, very soon begins to protect this newly discovered and highly important ancient Maya settle ment from further looting and vandalism, initiates an ar chaeological investigation and mapping and should docu ment the remaining inscribed stone monuments, which are definitely a very important contribution to the ever-growing corpus of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions.

The north-eastern part of the Guatemalan Department of Peten has been, archaeologically, divided in six distinctc«enctw(basins) : the Mirador, Tikal, Rio Ixcan, Holmul, Los Lagos, and Mopan Basins. The north eastern Peten extends over a territory of approximately 10.000 square km, is covered with tropical jungles and high rainfor ests and has no permanent large human settlements. The most northeasterly portion is the Rio Ixcan Basin, bordering to the north on Mexico and to the east on Belize. In this particular area Oscar Quintana, the former Technical Coordinator of the Programa de Rescate of the Projecto Protecciôn de Sitios Arqueolôgicos en Petén (PROSIAPETEN), a program of the Proyecto Nacional Tikal of the Guatemalan lnstituto de Antropologia e Historia (IDAEH), has investigated and reg istered since 1987 a total of 14 major archaeological sites which he designates in a new classification system with the codes 3-1 to 3-14. Some sites have been known to science for many decades, but the majority has only been discovered in recent years. These archaeological sites include Xultun, Chochkitam, Xmakabatun, La Honradez, Rio Azul, Kinal, Ramonai, Las Ventanas, Manantial (Quintana 1996; Quintana and Wurster 2001:56—76; Mayer 2002). Moreover the sites of El Susto, El Susto Mirador, Raton Pucteal, Las Cubetitas documented in 2001 and 2003 (Quintana 2004) and the site of San Bartolo with its famous mural paintings (O'Neill 2002; Saturno 2006) discovered in 2001. It has to be noted that archaeological sites in this remote corner of the rainforest of Guatemala were not discovered in the course of systematic archaeological surveys, but rather incidentally by Guatemalan lumbermen, chicleros and xateros, who live and work for a short time of the year in this almost uninhabitated area. The search and cutting of precious tropi cal trees by several logging companies has opened tracks and roads, making access to the region easier. However, these dirt roads are only passable for a few months in the dry season. These roads also enable looters to gain easier access to ancient Maya sites and there are no ruins which do not show traces of illicit excavations, even in the remotest places of the North eastern Peten. In March 2006 an international group ispected for three days a part of the Rio Ixcan Basin with the intention of investigating the present condition of the ruins of La Honradez and Chochkitam. The crew consisted of Julio Sanchez, thenew Technical Coordinator of PROSIAPETEN, Oscar Quintana, three employees of the IDAEH, namely Haroldo Tesucün, Yobani Marroqui'n and Jorge Aceituno Gomez, the German architect Dieter Richter and Karl Herbert Mayer, Graz, a staff MEXICO GUATEMALA A RiOAZUl OIXCANRJO pozoelcedroA Akinal z E "A LALINEA chochkitamA A lahonradezA LALAGUN1TAO SANBARTtX.0 A XMAKABATUN ramonalA EL SUSTO MtRADOR A XULTUnA T* RATON PUCTEAL IAGUNA PUCTSAl!

With a four-wheel pickup and amoto (a 4-wheeler, quad, or ATV) as means of transportation, the team departed from Yaxha and drove to La Lagunita, where near a small lake a lumbermen camp with some wooden houses stands; this is the seat of operation of the "Laborantes del Bosque", a lumbering company which has the official conces sion to work in this region. Their offices are in the town of Melchor de Mencos. On arriving at La Lagunita, seven tents were erected, where the group spent two nights. From the La Lagunita camp excursions by vehicles and on foot to the ruins of Chochkitam and La Honradez were undertaken, where in the last years looters had dug numerous tunnels and trenches into various structures. Sr. Dario de Jesus Berganza of the "Laborantes del Bosque" informed Oscar Quintana, that during mapping of the forest to the east of the camp in 2005, in order to find, select and mark particularly mature Spanish cedar and mahogany trees for * I «pJS ay; EBM5 Fig. 11. Looters' excavations in a structure (Photo by K. H. Mayer, 2006). cutting, a large concentration of Pre-columbian mounds were observed. These mounds are sited in a quadrant named "La Linea", because this area is situated very close to the border with Belize. On March 18,2006, early in the morning, the team, guided by Dario de Jesus Berganza, set out for La Linea from the La Lagunita camp and drove on a logging road to a bacadilla where logs are bunched by tractors awaiting to be loaded on the trucks and transported southwards to the town of Melchor de Mencos. From this point it was only a short walk of 20 minutes through dense forest to the ruins. The loggers had already tagged the trees to be removed. The geographical coordinates of the site were established with a hand-held GPS navigator, which gave the following readings: latitude 17°37.90' N, longitude 89°09.46' W; this places the site 8 km E from the ruins of Chochkitam ( 17° 37.50' N, 89° 12.70' W) and 10 km NNE of the campamento La Lagunita (17° 34.40' N, 89° 13.97' W), as the parrot flies (Fig. 9). The stay in the overgrown ruins lasted only 1.5 hours: in this short time photographs were taken of the more visible mounds and structures and the trenches and holes excavated by looters (Figs. 10, 11). Oscar Quintana, very experienced in these matters, prepared a provisional sketch map, which is shown here (Fig. 12). These newly discovered ruins, denominated simply "La Linea", are located on low hills. The site, oriented principally in a general north-south direction, covers a space of approximately 1.200 m in length and 800 m in width. The extension of the ruins is also documented in the detailedmaps produced in 2005 by technicians of the "Laborantes del Bosque". There are also many isolated small mounds situated on low hills outside of the site's centre. There is a large main plaza in the centre of the site, bordered by two monumental "acropolis" complexes. One architectural complex stands east Fig. 12. Sketch map of La Linea. (Drawing by Oscar Quintana, modified and inked by Hasso Hohmann, 2006).
