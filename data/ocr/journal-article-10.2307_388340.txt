<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROW, CHRISTINE M. Paul Valery, Consciousness and Nature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972. Pp. 270. This important study of Valery logically takes its place as a companion work to Judith Robinson's L'Analyse de l'Esprit dans les Cahiers de Valdry (Paris, 1963), because Miss Crow investigates the positive role of the emotions and irrational functions of the mind in Valery's "anti-natural humanism." She demonstrates that "anti-natural" does not imply a stifling of the emotions for Valery but rather their control by the conscious intellect, resulting in a total unity of mind to which Valdry gave great importance. Through the development of such discussion, Miss Crow succeeds in making that strange poem of Charmes, "La Pythie," perfectly understandable: "the 'Apollonian' orientation of Valery's thought is never mere rationalism" (p. 52). Rather than stressing Valery's attacks on love and women, Miss Crow shows how love was a chance for the linking of sensory, affective and intellectual experience which Valery sought. She puts forth Valery's idea that the complex</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 1233 relationship between the sensibilities of two human beings might create a higher conscious awareness, and she points out the vitality Valery discovered in happy love, as contrasted with the degradation of energy and increase of entropy caused by destructive passion. In like manner, Miss Crow examines Valdry's positive attitude toward nature. Anti-nature feelings have been attributed to Valery, but what he was really opposing were attitudes valuing the inverse of conscious intelligence, and imagery of a luxuriant and aimless vegetation. His criticisms of "description" and landscape painting are well-known. He was, nevertheless, extremely receptive to the charm of nature. But feelings, sensations, images were sifted, augmented, transformed by consciousness, producing then such exultant lines as "Et6, roche d'air pur," the superb ending of La Jeune Parque, the purified landscape of sun, sea, and cemetery in "Le Cimetiere Marin," and the image of the single tree in "Au Platane" and "Palme." If an anti-nature legend grew up around Valery, there has also been a legend making him out to be an intellectualist disdaining any productive workings of the unconscious mind. But as W. N. Ince has already shown, the unconscious has an important role in Valery's unified theory of the mind. It is the word "unified" which is important here. Valery attributes no superior life to the unconscious, and he was critical of Freud, believing that he divided the unconscious from the conscious instead of approaching the mind functionally as a "systcme de rapports." A large part of Miss Crow's book is devoted to Valdry's analogies between the natural development of the tree and intellectual creativity and maturation. One of the many advantages of the tree analogy is the possible evocation of a highly complex intellectual, affective, carnal system with no artificial divisions between voluntary and involuntary, intellect and emotion, mind and body. All this discussion does a great deal to illuminate the poetry, and my only reservation would be that Miss Crow sometimes appears to see the poems too much as illustrations of the ideas she is discussing. It is rather hard to believe that the famous lines from "Fragments du Narcisse," "L'arbre aveugle vers l'arbre 6tend ses membres sombres,/Et cherche affreusement I'arbre qui disparait", deny as well as affirm anthropomorphic meaning. One also wonders whether the last stanza of "Au Platane" is not simply a proud refusal by the "t&amp;te superbe" of the tree to lament, rather than a refusal of all the anthropomorphic imagery of the preceding seventeen stanzas. Is not the force and charm of "Poesie" somewhat submerged if its meaning is expanded until it becomes a metaphor for a maturing mind adding to its powers through mental exertions? Likewise, if "Palme" may well be considered in connection with the unified theory of the mind, by itself it seems doubtful that the poem evokes this unity. Its power lies instead in a focussing on the workings of the unconscious. Still, what appear to be overstatements of ideas do not detract from the value of this most interesting book. It is unfortunate, however, that the price of the volume ($17.50) is so outrageously high. Northwestern University Charles G. Whiting</page></plain_text>
