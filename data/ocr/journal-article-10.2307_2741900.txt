<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Publications as of 30 vi 78 [Publications received, of anthropological interest, will be listed for reference purposes and to draw them to the attention to the inter- national community. Listings will include the anthropological contents of periodicals and symposia and such descriptions as are neces- sary to convey the nature of the publication. Some titles in languages other than English will be translated and will appear in brackets. For serials, publication addresses and subscription information will be mentioned in the first listing and thereafter once a year, in the March issue. Listing does not preclude subsequent review by CA* treatment, although this will be rare.
