This 12th publication in Robert Laffineur's Aegaeum series represents the proceedings of the fifth in a series of bi- ennial International Aegean Conferences that he has or- ganized or coorganized since 1986. Invariably scheduled in April and initially held in Liege, these conferences have most recently taken place in Calvi (Corsica), Hobart (Tas- mania), and Heidelberg, where local coproducers (L. Basch, J.L. Crowley, and W-D. Niemeier, respectively) have been enlisted. Every conference has had a theme, and the pro-</page><page sequence="2">1996] BOOK REVIEWS 613 ceedings of each have been handsomely published within 15 months: funeral customs in Aegaeum 1 (1987), the tran- sition from the Middle to Late Bronze Age in Aegaeum 3 (1989), maritime affairs in Aegaeum 7 (1991), iconography in Aegaeum 8 (1993), and political and social concerns in the publication here under review. The first four confer- ences included between 20 and 35 contributions, but the fifth attracted no fewer than 51 submissions, resulting not only in an extra day of presentations in Heidelberg, but also in a two-volume publication format. Now that these gatherings have become similar in size and number to the symposia sponsored by the Swedish Institute in Athens during the 1980s under the directorship of Robin Hdigg, and roughly comparable in their impact on Aegean pre- history to the quadrennial International Cretological Con- gresses frequented by Minoanists or the quinquennial Mycenological symposia convened by Linear B specialists, their proceedings merit more attention from reviewers than they have thus far received (AJA 92 [1988] 605-606 and Gnomon 61 [1989] 271-73, both of Aegaeum 1 only). The presentation of the Politeia papers in eight unevenly populated, topical groupings reflects the order in which they were delivered in Heidelberg (Processes of State Formation [10]; Social Position of the Individual [2]; Econ- omy, Trade, and Craftsmanship [9]; Long-distance Contacts and Society [4]; Rulership and Polity [7]; Religion and Politics [6]; Iconography [6]; Geographical and Social Or- ganization [7]). Although the classification of individual papers under these rubrics occasionally appears somewhat arbitrary, such headings accurately indicate that the subject matter of the conference extended beyond purely political and social considerations. But the papers that impressed me most lent themselves to a simpler tripartite classifi- cation: those presenting or alluding to new discoveries or information of major importance; those furnishing com- prehensive updates on subjects of long-standing interest; and, most importantly, those offering novel approaches toward, perspectives on, or insights into already familiar bodies of data. Under the first heading fall Kilian-Dirlmeier's brief out- line of the architectural history and finds from the so-called "shaft grave" at Kolonna (Aigina); Korfmann's review of what his excavations of 1988-1993 have revealed concerning the size and occupational history of Troy VI-VII; Matsas's pub- lication of the full range of Minoan documents (see also CMS V Suppl. IB [1993] nos. 320-28) and other artifacts from Mikro Vouni (Samothrace), along with several new radiocarbon dates in support of an 18th-century B.C. con- text for these remarkable finds; and Aravantinos's report- ing of newly discovered tablets that had already quintupled the size of the Theban corpus of Linear B documents by the end of 1994 (see now RendLine ser. IX, 6 [1995] 1-37). Helpful summaries of present "states of the question:' with full references to earlier scholarship, include Nie- meier's review of the unusually potent island polity of MH and early Mycenaean Aigina; Cline's collection of scholarly opinions concerning Aegean natives resident in the Levant and Egypt during the second millennium B.C.; Gates's up- dating of the archaeological and textual evidence relevant to the Ahhiyawa problem; Younger's overview of Aegean "bull-games:' including a catalogue raisonne of the icon- ographic evidence for these that is nicely complemented by the Hallagers' interpretation of the relevant fresco and glyptic evidence as Knossian Neopalatial propaganda; Hiller's assessment of the ideological significance of LM II Palace Style pottery as symbolic of a new Knossian ruling group; and Bennet's full review of the evidence for the political geography of the Mycenaean state of Pylos. Admirably designed methodologies distinguish two dis- sertation summaries, Voutsakis's investigation of the social and political significance of shifting Argive Mycenaean funerary customs and Landenius-Enegren's attempt to isolate clusters of temporally linked documents in the corpus of Knossian Linear B tablets. Wedde's efforts to devise an objective approach to the analysis of Aegean glyp- tic exhibit a similar praiseworthy concern for method, though they are not quite as unparalleled as he seems to believe (cf. Sourvinou-Inwood, CMS Suppl. 3 [1989] 241-57). Blakolmer's diachronic survey of the Minoan use of painted plaster, like those of Driessen and Schoep directed, respec- tively, at architecture and at writing and sealing practices, brings helpfully into focus the major changes in all three spheres of activity between the Protopalatial and Neopa- latial eras. Dabney and Walberg likewise see a major break between the Old and New Palace periods in terms of social organization and the economy. Palaima's thoroughgoing contextualization of the "emergency sacrifice" tablet Tn 316 from Pylos allows him to assemble a convincing case against the existence of such an emergency, against the notion that the Mycenaeans practiced human sacrifice, and against the theory that the Pylian palace's destruction can be dated to the spring. Palmer's quantitative comparison of agricul- tural produce and associated personnel recorded in the Linear A archives of Ayia Triadha, Chania, and Zakro with equivalent data from the later Knossian Linear B texts pro- duces some interesting insights into how the first two sites should be ranked as administrative centers in the Neopa- latial era (cf. also Younger's comments in AJA 100 [1996] 164-65 on a 1994 article by Palaima). Pelon's and Crowley's stimulating but conflicting papers on the iconography of royalty and power, respectively, should be read in concert with the various contributions to The Role of the Ruler in the Prehistoric Aegean, edited by P. Rehak and published in the preceding volume of the Aegaeum series. As intriguing as any other paper in Politeia is Soles's wide-ranging and clearly argued explanation for Knossos's extraordinary influence throughout the Aegean in Neopalatial and later phases as reflecting its position as a "superordinate" or "cosmological" center along the lines of Mexican Teotihuacan, Andean Cuzco, or Mesopotamian Nippur. Similarly appealing is Deger-Jalkotzy's invitation to her audience to consider correlating the distinction between Greek dstu and p(t)olis with that between palatial and either pre- or post-palatial Mycenaean settlement nuclei. A number of papers are truly provocative in that their theses are virtually guaranteed to generate scholarly de- bate, or at least reaction, in the near future. Poursat argues that the emergence of a specialized class of artisans and their changing relationship to a palatial administration can be traced in the architecture of Quartier Mu at Malia. Watrous addresses a broad range of issues connected with Minoan peak sanctuaries, starting with how such sanctu- aries should be distinguished from "hilltop shrines" and</page><page sequence="3">614 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 100 moving on to when such sanctuaries began to function, what their ancestry is, who worshipped at them with what, and which divinities were the objects of worship and why. Stavrianopoulou suggests that the names for periods of time in the Linear B tablets from Pylos identify the king and queen as the recipients of cult and thus indicate that the Mycenaean wanax and his consort wielded religious as well as political power. By examining the full range of documents at both Knossos and Pylos in which the "col- lectors" play a role, Killen not only ventures to identify them as blood relatives of the royal family, but goes so far as to suggest that they may have been responsible for trade on behalf of the wanax in textiles, perfumed oil, and metals. In an especially well illustrated and documented survey of the function of bull's-head rhyta, Rehak concludes that, while such vessels may not have been specifically cultic in their function, both they and other relief-decorated rhyta appear to have been purposefully smashed by their own- ers. Maran suggests that a radical transformation during the Shaft Grave period in regional settlement patterns, types of settlement, and the use of earlier settlement centers as places of burial marks the emergence of local and regional elites on the mainland. If sustained, this theory may require the modification, or perhaps abandonment altogether, of the canonical view that "intramural burial" is a criterion of MH culture. Both Weingarten's investigation of propor- tions in Minoan anthropomorphic images and Halstead's attempt to chart and interpret the emergence of inequality during the Greek Neolithic open up interesting avenues of inquiry; neither scholar, however, seems to have con- vinced the Heidelberg audience that the available data can yet support their claims. Notwithstanding all this rich food for thought, as many as a third of the papers included in these proceedings would probably not have been accepted for publication if sub- jected to peer review. Given the high cost per page of this publication and the shrinking purchasing power of many institutional library budgets, editors of future volumes in this series are strongly encouraged to consider submitting the papers to some sort of evaluative screening process, even if this should cause some delay in what has thus far been a superbly prompt record of publication.
