<plain_text><page sequence="1">Africa 74 (2), 2004 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM: THE DISSEMINATION OF A CULT AGENCY IN THE CROSS RIVER AREA Ute Riischenthaler About a hundred years ago, the German explorer Leo Frobenius bemoaned in one of his first books (1898: 75) that in the Cross River area associations grew like mushrooms, then disappeared too quickly to be saved for academic study. The Cross River region is still known for its richness in associations and cult agencies. It is a vast rain forest, divided by the international borders of Cameroon and Nigeria, and sparsely populated by decentralised groups living in small villages often far apart from each other. These groups became known as Ejagham (Ekoi), Banyang, Boki, Anyang, Korup (Ododop), Yak6, Mbembe and many more. During the time of the slave trade most of them acted as middlemen. The Ejagham among whom I have undertaken most of my research' are one of the larger groups and live in about 140 villages-half of them in Nigeria, the other half in Cameroon.2 On average, a village owned between seven and ten associations (akum) and one or two cult agencies (ajom). Altogether, during my research I have encountered about seventy different cult agencies in the various Ejagham villages. The most widespread cult agencies in Ejagham villages were Obasinjom and Mfam, followed by Eburukpabi, Egbinon, Obasi, Eja, and less frequently mentioned, Moninjom, Nkayak, Eyumemfam, Igu, Ikumi and Agya. Many more were found only in a few of the villages. From the many associations and cult agencies whose dissemination histories I undertook to reconstruct3 as far as specific circumstances allowed, I have UTE ROSCHENTHALER teaches Anthropology at the Institut fiir Historische Ethnologie, University of Frankfurt am Main. Her research interests include the dissemination of culture, economic anthropology, and material culture. She has published (together with E. M. Chilver) Cameroon's Tycoon: Max Esser's expedition and its consequences (New York and Oxford: Berghahn 2001). 1 This paper evolved from a research project on the dissemination history of associations and cult agencies in the Cross River area of south-western Cameroon and south-eastern Nigeria between 1998 and 2001. The project was hosted at the Institut fiir Historische Ethnologie, University of Frankfurt am Main, and was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Council). An earlier version of this paper was presented at the EASA conference at Krakow, 26-29 July 2000. I would like to express my gratitude to all Ejagham who spent their time with me discussing the history of their institutions, and to Peter Geschiere, Carola Lentz, Michael Rowlands, Maryiln Strathern, and two anonymous readers, for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper. 2 The size of villages ranged between 5 and 500 houses, with an average village size of sixty houses. They made their living from growing food crops, fishing and hunting, as well as to a certain extent with the income from associations and cult agencies. Some localities also specialised in the production of pottery, camwood, yams, salt, canoes, and carvings among other trades-and since the last century also cash crops. 3 During the field research phase of the project I took down the histories of villages, associations and cult agencies in 130 villages or towns. Among them were eighty-one Ejagham</page><page sequence="2">242 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM chosen to discuss here the Obasinjom cult agency. I will present details of Obasinjom's dissemination history and its variants at the beginning of the twentieth century, as far as they were possible to reconstruct. Because of its impressive masquerade performance during the process of witchcraft divination, Obasinjom became one of the best known cult agencies in the Cross River area (cf. Ruel 1969; Thompson 1974; Koloss 1985) and beyond (Ardener 1970; Fisiy and Geschiere 1996). In the 1980s MacCaskie (1981: 125) criticised the fact that the literature discussing witch-hunting cults was mostly devoid of historical data. This is true not only for Ghana (where he worked) but elsewhere in Africa, though in the meantime there have been a number of more detailed studies on witchcraft (e.g. Geschiere 1997; Moore and Sanders 2001: 1-27). Obasinjom may be termed a witch-hunting cult, but it is not an anti-witchcraft movement. It is not acquired by potential victims of witchcraft (some reasons for this will be outlined in the second part of this essay, 'The transaction process'). Obasinjom offers its services to elucidate witchcraft and theft and provide solutions but it does not attempt to eliminate them permanently (cf. Niehaus 2003). Among the Bakwiri of Mount Cameroon, where Ardener witnessed the acquisition of the Obasinjom cult agency from the Cross River area in the 1950s, it became very prominent for some time until the problem of exposing Nyongo witches was solved in the context of the banana boom. Obasinjom was later occasionally revived or rebought. Most anti-witchcraft movements became virulent for a certain time, and then disappeared again as fast as they had sprung up. In the hinterland of the Cross River area where the cult allegedly originated, it did not just sweep over the country to disappear-as Frobenius's mushroom image suggests-but stayed in its core area and became a 'traditional institution' for nearly a hundred years. Of the eighty-one Ejagham villages under study, sixty-two had once acquired the Obasinjom cult agency or one of its variants and, between 1998 and 2001, forty-eight of them still had a functioning Obasinjom. It had died out mainly in places on the fringes of its dissemination area. In the Cross River area Obasinjom as well as the other cult agencies (ajom) and most of the women's and men's associations (akum) were disseminated by complex transactions of knowledge and use rights in intellectual property against material goods and services. Mindful of the immanent dangers of sharing and distributing secret knowledge, their owners carefully evaluated the social history of their potential exchange partners and then decided whether to sell it to them. Most institutions were not simply sold as commodities (on the market) in order to solve one specific problem; instead the knowledge was also shared to establish or consolidate relationships with other communities, alliances villages in Cameroon and Nigeria as well as forty-eight localities around the Ejagham country. The data were usually obtained in a session with the village council. It was presided over by the chief and included elders, representatives of the women and the youth. In addition, knowledgeable persons and specialists were interviewed individually.</page><page sequence="3">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 243 for trade and peace, and to create or enlarge spheres of influence. These transactions may be regarded as a variation of the giving-while-keeping strategy outlined by Weiner (1992) for Melanesia. By giving away objects that were felt to be essentially inalienable, part of the people's identity was also given away. This process diffused the identities and their agency into geographically distant areas. Simon Harrison (1992, 1993, 1999) has shown that knowledge and property rights in immaterial things, as well as the transaction of knowledge, the selling and buying of ritual offices and of rights in objects and design patterns, played an important part in contests of power and the construction of identity in many Melanesian societies. Along with the dissemination of the institutions, something of their identities was diffused and became incorporated into their histories over time and space. As immaterial property this knowledge could be kept and given away at the same time. In the Cross River area it did not, however, circulate in the sense that it came back to its original owner some time in the future-except perhaps when interested parties came to buy from them instead of from others because of the fame of their institution. With time, both institutions and their objects disseminated further away to other areas.4 For Mauss (1954) the (circulating) objects were the crucial mediators in establishing relationships. Recent studies have shifted their interest onto the more active part played by persons creating these relationships (Strathern 1988; Weiner 1992) and using the objects according to specific circumstances, intentions and politics (Appadurai 1986; Masquelier 1997). The objects are seen increasingly as the product of their owners' intentions who may declare them to be commodities or gifts, alienable or singular, purchasable or restricted under certain conditions, permanently or only temporarily transferred. Objects-and, as I will show in this paper, institutions as well-do hence accumulate histories (Kopytoff 1986; Gosden and Marshall 1999). Owners of the institutions like Obasinjom created decentralised networks, only parts of which effectively worked together. This has only changed in the very recent past as will be shown below. I will now first discuss the dissemination of cultural institutions in the Cross River area and, secondly, describe the performance of Obasinjom and its use by a village community. After briefly discussing the question of representation, I will present the details of its dissemination history and point out some of the implications of dissemination by purchase. I will conclude by outlining people's motives for engaging in transactions with knowledge. Thus, this paper is less about the complex of witchcraft itself than about how the Obasinjom cult agency was disseminated. 4 Harrison (1995) pointed out that ideas and practices are not solely a perquisite of post- industrial societies where access to knowledge and rights in the various forms of intellectual property are becoming more and more important. Marylin Strathern (1996) also emphasised that increasing competition about use rights indicates the relevance of knowledge as a valuable resource in different societies.</page><page sequence="4">244 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM EJAGHAM ASSOCIATIONS AND CULT AGENCIES The Ejagham differentiated conceptually and usually strictly between two types of transactable institutions: akum [sing. okum] ('associations') and ajom [sing. njom] ('cult agencies'). The ajom were said to work with and against mystical, supernatural (as Ejagham put it in English) or 'superempirical power' (Offiong 1991: 134) and uncovered hidden problems and machinations. The various ajom had individual but similar specialisations. Some specialised on certain diseases; some worked against witchcraft, theft or sorcery. Some were only protecting and others actively hunted witches and thieves. By contrast, the akum (men's and women's associations) were based on more mundane or visible powers and offered their services in the social and judicial domain by directly experienceable actions: the local village government employed the more important akum with executive functions. They acted as the police, restored order, made people pay their debts, collected fines, buried the dead or exhumed corpses to prevent ghosts from using their bodies to walk around and frighten people. Additionally, these associations offered conflict resolution for quarrelling parties. Associations celebrated all the important social events of their members-particularly funerals-where they usually staged their performance. Cult agency members would also attend the funeral of a member, but they did not intend to perform on that occasion. I have not heard of Obasinjom ever performing at a member's funeral with its mask. Akum ('associations') were always in the possession of a group of people, and usually placed under the auspices of the village government and its chief. By contrast, cult agencies (ajom) could also be in private possession or just used for personal protection. My Ejagham interviewees argued that a cult agency performed better if it was owned by a group. Cult agencies were generally owned by men. The women, however, owned a society or ritual which combined the properties of a 'natural' njom-their vagina-with an association which was used by the women as a group to 'catch' a person who had transgressed women's laws or when an 'unnatural' epidemic threatened the village.5 A njom as well as an okum was perceived as one conceptional body with all its parts belonging to the institution. In this way, Obasinjom, for example, 'was everything' that belonged to the njom as a whole: the members, the mask, the shrine, the laws, the symbols and insignia, its properties and its agency. Together with their members, both akum and ajom (if owned by a group) were perceived to be perpetual corporate institutions. Their existence neither ended with the death of individual members or their founder in a particular village, nor did it end with the decay of its objects, as the missionaries believed when they attempted to overcome their agency by destroying the material objects, or disappear with the Some people argued Ekpa Atu was solely a njom, others said it was an okum, and still others were not sure and maintained it could be both.</page><page sequence="5">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 245 prohibition of their names that colonial officers attempted (RHL Murray 1921-7; CNA Afam Juju). They could easily be continued under another name, with new objects or with their most visible shrines transferred into a sacred forest. Most contemporary Europeans underestimated the flexibility and inventiveness of the local population to adapt their institutions to historical conditions, and their ability to transform and disseminate them over the region. In the opinion of all those Ejagham whom I interviewed Obasinjom clearly belonged to the category of njom and not to that of okum. According to an English (Western) understanding, not only akum but also ajom owned by a group such as Obasinjom have properties of associations, because they have a body of members, initiation rituals and common aims among other things. On this understanding, 'association' refers more to membership and 'cult agency' more to their objects and divinities. Notwithstanding these differences, I prefer to talk of 'associations' and 'cult agencies' according to the Ejagham differentiation between akum and ajom. TRANSACTABILITY AND RESTRICTION IN THE ACQUISITION OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS In the Cross River area cult agencies (ajom) such as Obasinjom and Asunka, women's and men's societies (akum), as well as dance associations (akum) such as Oyim Ntim were disseminated by a process of complex transactions. Buying and selling of associations and cult agencies was, at least during the twentieth century (data before that time are even more difficult to obtain), the most common mode of their dissemination.6 At first view, it may appear surprising that entire institutions were transacted. Some of them-such as the well-known Ngbe (Ekpe) society, Obhon and Angbu and the women's equivalents Njom Ekpa and Belo-even constituted the executive arm of the village government. The Basel missionaries who, alongside their Catholic colleagues, established stations and schools in the area at the beginning of the twentieth century, found it 'strange' that the Ejagham were 'selling' their institutions (ABM Wdhr 1933). Above all, they wondered that the villagers sold Obasi-a term that they believed to denominate solely the Almighty God, and that Mansfeld (1908) circumscribed as the 'house's chapel'. They hardly imagined that it also denoted a cult agency knowledge of whose management could be alienated to interested communities. The Basel missionaries repeatedly complained that they were unable to disseminate the gospel because time and again they found the inhabitants of 'entire villages' were absent selling their 'gods' to neighbouring groups (ABM Stolz 1912). 6 There are about seven or eight more modes of dissemination which include branching, imitation, initiation into a diffuse network of members, or with migration. For more details see my book Purchasing Culture: the dissemination history of associations and cult agencies in the Cross River area of Cameroon and Nigeria (in preparation).</page><page sequence="6">246 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM When exactly the first cult agencies and associations were invented and whether they had always been transactable is difficult to decide. The available evidence from my research on the histories of villages and their associations and cult agencies suggests that the economic developments during the past centuries strongly encouraged their invention, elaboration and dissemination. Each of the localities under study had several strata of such institutions. There were institutions about whose invention and origin no memory existed and which had never been sold. Among them were those old associations that strictly separated freeborn from slaves, that performed after wars and in the night and day of a Big Man's funeral rites. Their names varied from village to village. They were called Nsibiri, Okongo, Nchebe, Nkuiambuk, Etokobiatu and so on, and some villages combined them with their power places. There were other institutions remembered to have been acquired by the forefathers, or whose acquisition the villagers had witnessed themselves. It appears that with increasing participation in the slave trade, more complex versions of both associations and cult agencies had been created or elaborated. Among these were the associations Ngbe, Obhon, Njom Ekpa and many of the cult agencies, particularly Obasinjom. Ngbe, Njom Ekpa and Obasinjom even had several grades and posts. They existed parallel to the older institutions. Dance associations belonged to 'the village' and were subsumed under the Ngbe society which soon after its introduction had become the most powerful institution in the localities.7 Dance associations that belonged to independent groups of people in a village were a new development that began around the 1950s. These more recent dance associations were usually not graded and the initiation ritual was reduced to a formality. Their owners were usually the youth of a village who competed with other villages in producing the most 'modern' and most 'wonderful' performances. There was much discussion among the youth about whether Ejagham traditions knew something like copyright and what to do about the repeated stealing of the associations' dances (R6schenthaler 2004). Other associations and the cult agencies had a more substantial body of secret knowledge and practices which did not favour plagiarism. Being traders of old, the communities in the Cross River area had not only well-developed ideas about the value of things but also of knowledge and other forms of intellectual property. Inventions and novelties were sold to other communities who expressed a desire to own them. But not all institutions were sold. Permanently inalienable institutions were the ancestor cults, the land and the local power places. Others were not marketable because either all localities already 7 The historical evidence available will be presented in my book Purchasing Culture: the dissemination history of associations and cult agencies in the Cross River area of Cameroon and Nigeria. This book will contain the results of the research project and more details on individual dissemination histories and the transaction process. An entire chapter will be dedicated to the development of Ngbe/Ekpe in the context of the trade.</page><page sequence="7">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 247 owned them or because they consisted of common knowledge or culture, such as the Nkim or Ace dances that were widespread and were performed without official invitation. Although the communities in the Cross River area regarded most of their associations and cult agencies as potentially transactable elements of culture, not all of them were always intended for transaction. Insulated associations were sometimes declared a 'singular institution' (Kopytoff 1986: 73) and thus their dissemination restricted. In this way, it was taken out of circulation either permanently or temporarily. This strategy was used, for example, when a community had founded a dance association or a cult agency of which it claimed sole ownership. Singularity also worked, at least for some time, when its owners had acquired an institution from far away and as long as the neighbouring communities did not own that society. If the institution performed successfully, it attracted clients from all over the area in the case of a cult agency or, in the case of an association, it was invited to perform at the major festivities. The dance association Egbobha of Inokun was an example of a temporary singular institution. Cult agencies were more often declared temporarily singular; for example, Moninjom was said to have been restricted to a group of villages for some decades, and the agency of Eburukpabi even gave its name to the village of Ofrikpabi. Because these restrictions were part of a legitimation discourse, desire and its realisation were often not separable. Declaration of an association as a singular institution can, following Harrison (1999: 240), be interpreted as a demonstration of power that not every institution or community was able to maintain. Obasinjom never appears to have used this strategy. Its alleged first owners decided to sell it so that it rapidly became well known and disseminated all over the area. Thus, neither for objects nor for institutions were transactability or inalienability fixed categories or permanent conditions. Their current status depended as much on their owners' intentions and on individual people's decisions as on common local assumptions and commercial opportunities. The dissemination histories of associations and cult agencies could be reconstructed (at least partially) because their owners also ritually used to recall the name of their founder and the village from which they were acquired. In the more or less elaborate libation speech to the ancestors of the institution, its chief occasionally also mentioned the name of the chief who sold it to them, those of the past chiefs of the institution in the own village (or at least some of them) and the places to which the institution was sold later on. Before detailing its dissemination history, I will briefly describe Obasinjom's performance. It was a particularly successful institution and subsequently disseminated into numerous localities. Its secret of trade consisted in profiting from clients by transforming their need for consultation into an entertaining show for the village community. Obasinjom-and its variations Asunka, Mfogha and Ekuri Ebhok-visualised their witchcraft detecting agency as a masquerader that performed when he sensed a problem or at the request of</page><page sequence="8">248 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM PLATE 1 Obasinjom performing at Ebam, January 2000. (Photo: Ute R6schenthaler)</page><page sequence="9">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 249 clients in the village centre. He was dressed in a large dark-blue gown decorated with cowries. His carved head8 combined symbolical representations of his powers: from his head extended yellow garden eggs like antennae for transmission of witchcraft talk; his head was crowned by a huge crest of black feathers to enable him to fly 'as fast as an eagle'; his mouth was long like that of a crocodile to smell out witchcraft. His mouth with carved teeth carried a native egg (Obasinjom and Asunka), or an axe (Ekuri Ebhok) for divination. His gown was sprinkled with mud from his search for witches in the water. THE PERFORMATIVE POWERS OF OBASINJOM The success of the Obasinjom cult agency and of its variations depended to a large extent on its capacity of visualising its witchcraft detecting agency by means of an eye-catching masquerade performance. When he was called or sensed witchcraft in the village, the mask carrier fell in a state of trance, the members and musicians assembled and he started performing. He ran up and down the village street in small steps as if flying, and his blue gown blew up with air. At his heels were his translator (asomenjom) in expectation of hearing his revelation, accompanied by two gun carriers and erutunjom with his trumpet. Manjom, his so-called wife, remained at the village square and, from time to time, blew whiskey at him. The number of performers was more or less the same in the various villages, as also for Asunka and Ekuri Ebhok (see also Ebot 1978: 445; Ojage 1995: 20 f.; Agbor 1997; Oben 1987; see for the performance Ruel 1969; Thompson 1974; Koloss 1985). The performers in the various villages usually included: Ebhunjom, the mask carrier. Asomenjom, the translator, who interpreted to the audience the message of the masquerader. Sometimes there were two. Agunenjom, two gun bearers, also called abhunenjom, abhunasom or agun-ngwang. They carried dane guns (or spears) and moved or stood directly behind the mask. They appeased the wrath of the njom by pressing the guns on the ground. When this was done, the njom could neither move nor speak until the erutunjom sounded his horn. 8 The carved headpieces for the Obasinjom masks were generally not skin-covered. An Obasinjom headpiece collected by Talbot is in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. An Obasinjom mask with gown can be found in the Museum of Oron, Nigeria, collected by Keith Nicklin, and one in the Linden-Museum Stuttgart, Germany, collected by Hans-Joachim Koloss. This list is not complete.</page><page sequence="10">250 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM PLATE 2 Obasinjom performing at Ebam (client and translator to the right), January 2000.

This was done by blowing a long horn at his heels. Manjom, the 'wife of Obasinjom', to appease the Obasinjom when in wrath. By virtue of virginity, she ground certain herbs that were needed to perform the rituals on the shrine of the cult agency. Ebhamenjom carried the bag or the bowl. Among the performers in the background were: Ebhanga nnenjom, the chief of the cult agency who poured the libation. Atui ajom, the other chiefs or elders of the njom. Atunyak, the man of bitterness or darkness, who never danced. He led the others. Nsibiri-nkwen, the wicked or dangerous man, who did not dance either. The performances of the three cult agencies Obasinjom, Asunka and Ekuri Ebhok were similar. Members insisted that they differed in the composition of their medicines. Talbot's Ekuri Ebhok had, apart from a clay trumpet covered with leopard skin, one performer with a fisherman's net. Talbot (1912) interpreted the helpers with the guns as hunters and the fishing net as a symbol for a trap. In Etinkem the cult agency bore the name Nsibiri, and his interpreter was called Nkwen Ekoko Nsibiri. The mask was followed by two performers with horns (instead of guns) by means of which he smelled the witches. This mask held a cutlass and carried two half sticks in his mouth with halves of limes stuck to their ends. The mask was similar to that of Obasinjom but did not speak with a voice. A really very different variation of Mfogha (Asunka) was described by Okpokam (1986: 49-54) in the village of Okanga. There three masks performed together called Akpang, Esu and Nkona Ngun. Akpang raced around and flung stones at offensive objects, finally he collapsed before the shrine and was carried in. Esu was here the long-mouthed masquerade but moved slowly and carefully checking spots, ordering the Abhon Okan to carry guns. Nkona Ngun moved very slowly with a pot of fire on the head. Another variation of this form of divination represented Igu. According to villagers in Mfaminyen (Ejagham) and Obubra (Mbembe), a member of Igu put medicine in a mortar, and after he pounded it, he became possessed and was able to tell where something was wrong in the village. Igu also had a searching performance that was not seen but just heard in the night. In the Bangwa country right at the eastern extension of Obasinjom, the mask would divine but not dig out witchcraft. This was done by Ekungdang who worked--as Nkona Ngun in Okanga-with a pot of fire on its head.</page><page sequence="12">252 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM When the Obasinjom mask returned from searching the edges of the village, he communicated his findings in an incomprehensible language to his assistant(s) who translated his speech to the public. In this way, he gave advice to his client, ordered the villagers to cut down a tree in which witches used to gather or to dig out a bundle of dangerous medicine meant to harm innocent people from its hidden abode. His divinations were alternated by regular drumming and singing of the choir in which the onlookers were actively involved in a game of question and answer. Ojage (1995: 23) has transcribed such a song to illustrate the metaphoric language full of proverbs and riddles which Obasinjom used to explain his finding and the problems of clients.9 A woman, or a man from the choir would start the song as a solo singer, then the choir consisting of the remaining Obasinjom members answered the solo joined by the public: SOLO: When the cult hut is broken down... SOLO: When the cult members scatter... SOLO: When the cult agency is unattended to... SOLO: When the cult agency remains mad... SOLO: When witches are set free... CHOIR: The cult agency will become homeless. CHOIR: The cult agency will become mad. CHOIR: The njom will behave like a mad man. CHOIR: Witches will be set free. CHOIR: Everybody will be in danger. Ojage (1995: 50) further explains that the poetry and 'the relevance of the Obasinjom performance lies in the united spirit of collective involvement of the audience and the njom in the serious decisions taken at the end. The answers committed everybody. At the end the divinee was left with the feeling that the decisions taken against him or for him were not those of an individual but of the whole community, championed by the njom.' The song also implied the often mentioned potential danger inherent in the possession of a cult agency. If not well attended, the njom would no longer protect the community efficiently and attack persons with unlawful intentions but turn against owners and the entire community. A new carrier of the Obasinjom mask, as I was told repeatedly, had to undergo a test. Members dripped a liquid into his eyes, and when the medicine showed an effect of trance and trembling, he was required to go to the forest and collect herbs that 'the medicine would show him'. As Richard Etchu Ayuk of the rural radio Voice of Manyu put it: If the spirit corresponds with your blood, you are capable to exploit the forest to harvest herbs that you use at any time you want to perform or at 9 A performance will always include the repetition of some basic songs, as well as others which vary for most Obasinjom performances. I have recorded a number of performances myself but found this song that Ojage recorded most illuminating.</page><page sequence="13">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 253 any hour when Obasinjom sees a problem in the village. You must head towards the village, and you start shouting: 'Wo, wo, wo', and your body begins to shake and the people start hitting the drums, and assemble some of the materials, and they start singing and he starts telling whatever thing goes on in the village spiritually. Obasinjom did not act all alone; it closely cooperated with another cult agency. At Oban, this second cult agency was called Eburukpabi (Talbot 1912). It was also called Eburukpabi by Asunka members in Babong where Asunka had after its coming killed many of the older cult agencies such as Mfam, Moninjom, Amok, Okebhone, and Egbinon but not Eburukpabi. Not all Eburukpabi, however, were associated with Obasinjom or Asunka, and it was not called by that name in every village. Among the names given to me were Eburukpabi, Egbinon, Nkong, and in the Obang villages Agya, but these were not necessarily the same ajom under different names. Members at Nsofang said they bought Obasinjom together with Ekpri Okpa from Okuri. In Nigerian villages Egbinon was often thought to be a much feared and destructive cult, and in fact it was also the name of one of the grades or sections of Obasinjom as will be shown below. In some villages both cult agencies were acquired together, in others the second cult agency was already there or had been acquired from somewhere else. The chief of Mbatop explained in 1998: 'There is Obasinjom and there is Egbinon which is attached to Obasinjom. Egbinon is the one who really confines you when a witch is caught. It is elder than Obasinjom, it is senior.' OBJECTS AND AGENCY Each njom consisted of a main shrine that stood in the centre of the village, at its entrances or in a sacred grove. Some ajom were specialised in only protecting the village against diseases and other ominous influences. Others were active in fighting any evil that threatened to invade the village. The power of a cult agency was said to derive from the particular concoction of mineral, plant and organic substances applied to the objects representing the agency. In an initial speech with a sacrifice, its owners called it by its name as if talking to a person and gave their orders to the cult agency. It became an agent able to see, hear and smell what was going on in the village. By this process the cult agency was supplied with a kind of intelligence to follow the orders given. It was not thought to have a will of its own, but it could also kill its owners. It was ritually provided with what Alfred Gell (1998) has called secondary agency. Were the cult agency to encounter a person with unlawful intentions, it rendered her or him quite literally a patient by making her or him ill. Eventually, a family head in Kembong explained: 'The Obasinjom people are called lazy people because they never go into the bush, but go around to greet people,' and as Agbor (1997: 54) put it in her BA dissertation on the Banyang: 'The ultimate truth lies with its members.' The cult agency's owners maintained that if the patient sought advice in time, he could induce the cult agency to</page><page sequence="14">254 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM PLATE 4 The cult agency Eburukpabi in the village centre of Otu, December 1999. (Photo: Ute R6schenthaler)</page><page sequence="15">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 255 remove the illness against proper compensation. Otherwise the patient would die as a consequence of the njom's agency. For such events, each member had a smaller version of the njom in his private house to protect the compound or other property and which he could bring along to such occasions or for individual consultation according to the njom's specialisation. These had different shapes, for example, of a pair of filled antelope horns for Mfam in Araru in 1988 and in Ayaoke in 1999, an amorphous bundle for Eburukpabi in Ayaoke 1999, or a small carved piece of wood in Babong in 1988, the twin figures of a man and a woman made of wood or clay for Obheni in Ajaman in 1998. The village court made the patient confess his deeds in the face of the cult agency. Then its owner advised the patient which items he had to bring in order to solicit the njom in the hope of curing the illness. Cult agencies were a source of wealth for their owners-wealth that was otherwise easily associated with ideas of witchcraft or jealousy and also with potential duties of redistribution (Rowlands and Warnier 1988; Fisiy and Geschiere 1996). The Basel missionaries used to complain that the owners of cult agencies enriched themselves by exploiting the problems of the poor (ABM Autenrieth 1928). Different persons reiterated that they possessed associations and cult agencies 'to have something to eat' and regarded them as an investment to survive better. Some compared them to well-kept farms or to the salt ponds that some Ejagham villages owned and that ideally provided wealth endlessly. They acquired wealth by offering services, by initiating new members, by selling the institution to other communities, and by staging their performances. The colonial officer Talbot (1912) already noted that he was able to conclude the general condition of an Ejagham village from the state and the number of the masquerades and associations it owned. There was no verbal category in the Ejagham language to express the ontological being of cult agency objects or masked dancers as such. They were not considered to belong to the category of persons, of animals, of spirits or of objects, neither 'were' they the ancestors. They 'were' njom or okum, belonging to the cult agency or the association, and were called okum, eci okum, or eci njom, the 'image', 'head', 'mask' or 'face' of the association or the cult agency. The obasinjom mask was simply called eci njom much in the same way that the carved box of the njom ekpa women's society was called eci njom ekpa, or the masked dancers of ngbe and angbu were okum ngbe and okum angbu. They were regarded as emanations of a particular okum or njom, representing the institution as a power-enacting body that had agency and took part in governing or problem solving without making individuals responsible for the effects. In the performances of associations, the central performer could additionally represent the founder of the institution as the ancestor or originator in a village who had enacted its powers as its living chief did now. But performances were more thought to be staged in the ancestors' honour. With the transaction, the owners sold the institution, the rights and the knowledge while keeping them at the same time. They were alienated while kept in a more literal sense than it would be possible</page><page sequence="16">256 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM with objects because incorporeal property was in its immateriality unlimitedly reproduceable (Strathern 1996) and in a sense free from questions of authenticity usually attached to objects (Fowler 1997; R6schenthaler 1999a). Because of its immateriality, however, and of its secrecy there was no visible proof of its exactly being the same after the transaction. There was just the oath the owners swore after having taught the knowledge sufficiently to the new owners. Though the idea of originality of an institution existed, the further away it moved from its assumed origin the more it was thought to lose its originality. During the libation speeches, the associations' chief memorised part of the institution's history. Whether or not they built up a network, in this way associations and cult agencies remained attached to the community from which they were bought. With their continuation in a village and with their dissemination over an area at the same time, the institutions became vested with history, a history that was transmitted during the transaction process to new owners, and thus the institution acquired a biography. The acquisition of the association still entailed another process. During the transaction process, the knowledge of and the rights in the association were acquired. But the owners did not sell their own objects and masks. The buyers commissioned them separately from a carver. This often entailed high expenditure again, sometimes as high as the institution itself. When the women of Ewelle, for example, bought the women's association Njom Ekpa from Ajayukndip village in 1997, they spent about 200,000 CFA francs on the society (feeding excluded) and another 200,000 CFA francs on the mask. The masks were often bought from a different place, the choice of which depended on the skills of the carver. This transaction was much easier and the result immediately visible. The carver was told which type of object was needed and how it should look. The clients expected, as carvers and association members repeatedly confirmed, that the object was recognisable as belonging to a specific association, but also to be slightly different, to be a unique example of the category. Thus the history of the objects was partially different from that of the institution. Both converged at a certain point, when the acquired institution commissioned its own objects, then they also diverged or diffused when the institution was alienated further and the new owners commissioned new objects that, in being similar while still different, were crucial for their identity (Harrison 1999). The societies led the path, the objects followed shortly after, and from increasingly further away. Recently, the associations and also cult agencies such as Obasinjom opted to buy their masks from Annang carvers in Akwa Ibom because they were believed to be the better carvers and to carry out any commission quickly. OBASINJOM'S DISSEMINATION HISTORY AND THE TRANSACTION OF SECRET KNOWLEDGE The invention of Obasinjom obviously took place after the peak of the creation and dissemination of the other more complex institutions such</page><page sequence="17">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 257 as Ngbe. The first mention of the Obasinjom type of cult agencies known to me is made by Talbot in his work In the Shadow of the Bush (1912). At that time Obasinjom was still called by its older name Akpambe. Talbot wrote: 'The four jujus with the widest distribution are Mfam, Ofiri, Mfuor and Akpambe. All alike protect against witchcraft and theft' (op. cit.: 51). Talbot witnessed the performances of Akpambe, Ekuri Ebhok and 'Mfuor' or Mfogha at the festival of the New Yams in Oban where he had been stationed since 1907: 'The images of all three Jujus [Akpambe, Ekuri Ebhok and Mfogha] wear robes of dark blue native cloth, bordered with a fringe of palm-fibre and decked with the silvery shells of a bivalve ... In each case the "image" bears a roughly-carved crocodile's head upon its own' (op. cit.: 52-53). He adds that 'Mfuor [Mfogha] was ... devoted to the great Juju "Asunga"' (op. cit.: 413) and that Asunka (and another cult agency called Eja) needed the sacrifice of a slave every second year to renew their power during the time of harvest. His description of the masks and a photograph of Akpambe (op. cit.: 198) taken by Talbot in Oban correspond to the performances I have seen myself. During the time of my research since the late 1980s I have not heard of or seen an Obasinjom performing at an occasion other than for witchcraft-related events. The novelty of the cult agencies may have accounted for the masks performing at the New Yam festival. Talbot knew that Akpambe was introduced to Oban from the village Okuri just a few years after his arrival. He wrote: 'Early in 1909 the cult of Akpambe invaded the District and rapidly gained such a reputation that lodges were established in almost every town. The cult was started about a year earlier by a man named Obasi Abong who was taught the necessary rites by his mother, a celebrated juju woman of Okuri in the Cameroons, where its first shrine still exists.' Talbot refers to a photograph on p. 158 of his book showing the village square of Okuri where a shrine could be identified. This would mean that at that time in Okuri the shrine was inside the village. Talbot continues: 'Many older cults were overthrown at the coming of Akpambe, but the shrine of Eburuk Pabi stands untouched. People even aver that the new Juju can not enter a place unless Eburuk Pabi is there first; for the latter alone confers the power of "seeing" Akpambe. Certainly the "Okum" [here: 'mask'] at each "play" bows before the shrine of Eburuk Pabi. The sign of Eburuk Pabi is an earthen pot' (op. cit.: 52). Talbot does not give any hints as to the origin of the other two cult agencies-Mfogha and Ekuri Ebhok-that he observed in Oban. The likely late date of origin of Obasinjom in 1908 in Okuri would account for the fact that Mansfeld did not mention Obasinjom in his own book. His book Urwald-Dokumente was already published in 1908.10 In his 10 Alfred Mansfeld does not mention Obasinjom in his later publication (1924) which however does not contain new material but summarises the first book and includes a chapter on biology and geography of the area by H. Reck. Mansfeld directed the station at Ossidinge from 1904 until the outbreak of the First World War.</page><page sequence="18">258 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM MA dissertation, Ojage (1995: 19) gives a competing story of origin. His research revealed that Obasinjom originated in Mbinda. His informant from Ayaoke who claimed to be ninety years old when interviewed in 1994 had told him: 'Noticing that the village had degenerated into perversive acts of witchcraft and other forms of evil, an ancestor is said to have appeared in a dream to a man called Eku Erim in Mbinda village, Upper Ekwe. He revealed to Eku the secret with which to salvage the community from evil. In view of the burdensome nature of the mission, he invited a few reliable members of the community to share in the revelation. This became the origin of the cult with a constitution enacted to govern its functioning. After due consideration, the original members of the cult accepted to sell lodges to other communities that opted to buy it.' He continued that Ayaoke was the first village to buy Obasinjom from Mbinda after its invention. The second early source that mentions Akpambe [Obasinjom] is the Basel missionary Stolz (ABM Stolz 1912, 1913). In 1912, only a few years after its alleged invention in Okuri or Mbinda, the missionary observed that the cult agency had already reached the Banyang. He met the members of Ekwambe [Akpambe] of Ntenako in the Banyang village of Bachuo Ntai while selling Akpambe to the latter for a good sum of money. The transaction was confirmed in 2001 by the elders of Bachuo Ntai. In the same year, missionary Stolz also mentioned that one of his teachers at the mission school at Ajayukndip told him that in May 1912 he had witnessed the purchase of Asunka from a man named Ewa from the village 'Nbwor' [Mkpot?] for 700 German marks with the purpose of catching witches (ABM Stolz 1913). The missionary was told that this Ewa had invented Asunka because his own mother was a witch. One day she refused to open the door because she was practising witchcraft. Ewa managed to enter the house and killed her. He split her skull and created the medicine of Asunka from her skull bones (ABM Stolz 1913).11 More fragments of Asunka's dissemination history were uncovered by research. The villagers of Old Ndebiji and Babong remembered having bought Asunka with the masked performance from Mkpot Akangkang. Babong villagers then sold Asunka with the masked performance to Ovum village who sold it to Ojok. Ojok sold it to Esukutan (who confirmed having bought it from an Ejagham village). Ovum sold it without the masked performance to Nkame. In the meantime, Babong had become prominent in Asunka. Babong also sold it, without the masked performance, to the villages of Abat, Agborkem, Aja, Inokun, Ndekwai, Njege, Ogomoko, Kembong, Small Mamfe and perhaps also to Baro. At least Baro claimed to have acquired its Asunka from Babong; Nsofang and Inokun could not remember from where they had bought their own Asunka. Okuni claimed to have it from Ofumbonga-Mbembe " In Ajayukndip in January 2000, however, nobody remembered the transaction. I have not myself been to Mkpot Akangkang which is deep inside the forest in Cross River State.</page><page sequence="19">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 259 which would suggest a more westerly origin.12 Then, according to Okpokam, Okanga-Mkpansi bought Asunka, together with the villages of Agbaragba and Mkpura, from Ojo in Akamkpa. This was the special variation of Asunka called Mfogha with three masks, one among them carrying a smoking pot. Murray saw 'Mfuoho' [Mfogha or Asunka] in Oban and also on his Akpabuyo tour of 1924 in settlements of the peninsula east of Calabar Town (RHL Murray 1921-7). Probably Asunka disseminated even further to the south-east and the north-east of the Ejagham. The missionary Pfenning (1939), for example, mentions Asunka in Dikume Balue, and the British colonial administrators Sharwood-Smith and Cantle found Asunka in the Anyang country (CNA Sharwood-Smith and Cantle n.d.). Asunka was also present in some Bangwa villages of Lebialem Division. Ekuri Ebhok is referred to in archival documents only by Murray (RHL Murray 1921-7). He saw 'Ekuri Ibok' in Oban and in settlements in Akpabuyo. He wrote: 'The country is under the two societies Ekuri Ibok and Mfuoho.' Ebot (1978: 442 ff.) mentioned it as Ekpribok. If it is spelled correctly Ekuri Ibok, the name is in the Efik language and means 'the cult agency with the axe', but foreign names were also used because of their exotic connotations. Talbot had seen Ekuri Ebhok in Oban. The gown was still there in 2001, but the Clanhead of Oban did not remember from where the njom was acquired. Ajaman and Akwa had bought Ekuri Ebhok from Oban. Talangaye and part of Ossing claimed to have bought Ekuri Ebhok from Ajaman. Mfuni did not remember itself, but knew that it had the same Ekuri Ebhok as Talangaye and therefore came from the same source. The fragments of the dissemination histories of Asunka and Ekuri Ebhok do not allow us to conclude where either was originally invented, except that it probably happened in the Cross River State of Nigeria. Asunka is mentioned several times at Mkpot Akangkang and Ekuri Ebhok at Oban. Its name might suggest an Efik or Ibibio origin, but there is no reference for this. Only one village, Okuni, indicated an Akwa Ibom origin, yet not for Ekuri Ebhok but for Asunka. Ekuri Ebhok and Asunka were not as widespread as Obasinjom itself. The early documents available to me that date the origin of Obasinjom to 1908 in Okuri are Talbot, and Stolz who mentions it in 1912-only four years later-among the Banyang village of Bachuo Ntai which is situated some three or four days travel on foot to the east. After the First World War, Akpambe was prohibited by Order in Council No. 11 of 1917 by the British colonial government (RHL Murray 1921-7). The Ejagham renamed the cult agency Obasinjom and carried on with its activities. In a similar way, Mfogha is today better known under the 12 The man who bought it was said to be Eni Ekri. The Oyim Ntim dance association originated from the same area. Also other cult agencies such as Igu came from this geographical direction. On the one hand, this might hint at an older trade route and, on the other, indicate that the masquerade might have been added around Mkpot, Okuri, Mbinda or Oban to the cult agency performance of Igu.</page><page sequence="20">260 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM Intemational Boundaey Cross River Nigeria '* Cameroon Okur / .Ikom ANYANG (1920s) Agborkem Nsofang * Mamfe O Ndekwai Mkpot Ogomoko Akangkang Inokun Ke ong Ajayukndip Nkame Old Ndebij Ovum Okoroba o bat Lebialem E ,,~(Ngub *Oban I Baro (1909,1924)i Akpabuyo (1924,19M4) Dikume Balue (1939) FIGURE 1 Map of the dissemination history of Asunka/Mfogha IntermatonalBoundary Nigeria ,...i M Camenroon CroMap of the Dss Riveremnaon of N mn , /MAor  Map of the Dkeminwtion of Igu ...

Names were also often translated from one language to another-Obasinjom was known among the Boki as Osowobokie, meaning 'the God of the cult agencies' (i.e. the most powerful of all the cult agencies), as it did in the Ejagham language. Obasinjom's dissemination history is too extensive to give all the details here. Out of the eighty-one Ejagham villages under study, fifty- five had once acquired the Obasinjom cult agency (forty in Cameroon and fifteen in Nigeria). Out of the forty-eight villages around the Ejagham country, eighteen villages had once owned Obasinjom. Other</page><page sequence="22">262 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM villages owned Asunka or Ekuri Ebhok instead or in addition to it. Kembong village once had three Obasinjom at the same time, owned by different groups of quarters. Two of these were still functioning in 2001. Of the eighty-one villages, only nineteen had never acquired any of the Obasinjom variations with a mask. Some villages never had enough money to acquire it, others were too small to have their own Obasinjom, still others decided to join an adjacent village's Obasinjom or to buy it jointly with them. The villages of Mbinda and Okuri remain contested places of origin.13 In the case of Obasinjom, no other villages claimed an alternative invention of Obasinjom or to have acquired it from a very different place, as was the case with some of the associations. Okuri and Mbinda are situated closely together. With Ajaman they claim descent from a common ancestor and once stayed together at a place called Ocek Nne. Ajaman never owned Obasinjom but Ekuri Ebhok. The invention should have taken place after the split.14 From the fifty- seven Obasinjom (Kembong had three), forty-five remembered clearly where they had bought their own Obasinjom, four were not sure, and eight did not know. Seven said they had bought it directly from Okuri and nine from Mbinda. Ayaoke was certainly among the first villages to acquire Obasinjom from Mbinda. Ayaoke quickly became well known for the qualities of its Obasinjom performance and sold it to ten more villages, followed in numbers only by Ekoneman Awa, Ewelle, Nsanakang and Eyumojock who sold it ten, seven, five, and four times respectively. Other villages (thirty-four) remembered having sold Obasinjom not more than once, twice or thrice. All the others remained of average renown in performing Obasinjom and never were given the chance to sell it to another place. Altogether Obasinjom was sold more than a hundred times by the various villages15 and reached far beyond the Ejagham country. To the south-west it reached 13 It is interesting to note that Nkame villagers remembered that Obasinjom came from Mbinda during Chief Efambe or Okpambe's reign, whereas Nsanaragati and Onaku said it was bought from a man named Efa who came with his son to teach them Obasinjom. According to the Regent Chief of Egbekaw, Ete Efa came from Ayaoke to teach Egbekaw the Obasinjom. The name is somewhat reminiscent of the Ewa said to have invented Asunka. 14 Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to visit the places situated on the border with Nigeria because the route was unsafe at that time and would involve a twelve-hour journey on foot from the nearest motorable road in Cameroon. Mansfeld (1908) mentions all three villages, saying that the Ngbe hall of Okuri was the largest in the area. Okuri was twice the size of Mbinda. Talbot (1912: 158) wrote that Okuri was big and a town of considerable importance. In 1925, Mbinda had fourteen houses and Okuri forty-one (CNA Cantle 1926). In 1937, Mbinda had ten houses and Okuri twenty (CNA Swabey 1937). Possibly the two villages managed the cult agency together. 15 It was possible to verify twenty-five of the acquisitions by cross-checking. In thirteen cases the data did not fully match, but in only two cases were the claims explicitly denied by the villages visited for cross-checking. Some non-matching data may be due to hidden inter-village conflicts, others to failing memory, or to the desire or imagination of having sold the cult agency to many places. Due to time restrictions, the other data could not be cross-checked by travelling to the places mentioned by the sellers.</page><page sequence="23">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 263 the Efik (Aye 1994: 63) and Akpabuyo (RHL Murray 1921-7),16 to the north-west the Yakd,17 Okuni, Okanga (Okpokam 1986), Nkum and Ikom, Akparabong and the Etung-Ejagham villages from where it travelled further north to Boki and Anyang villages. To the east, it was acquired by most Banyang villages up to Tali and Sabes (cf. Ruel 1969: 210-13). Obasinjom ends around Kendem and Widekum. It did not reach Numba, but extended to individual villages of the Busam clan in the Momo Division, and in Fontem or Lebialem, to individual Mbo villages, mainly Nguti, to individual Bassossi and even Bakossi, Ngolo, Mbonge and some Balundu villages. Ebding mentions it in Bakundu around the First World War (ABM Ebding 1904-14). The time span given for acquisition ranged from German colonial time to the 1970s. There were a spectacular number of sales right to the coast at Mount Cameroon. The villages of Ossing, Ntenako, Ndekwai and Egbekaw remembered having sold their Obasinjom to various Bakwiri (among them Bokwango, Bonjongo, Small Soppo, Lisoka) and Balong villages (around Muyuka) between 1955 and 1957. These sales were well remembered, not only among the eastern Ejagham and Banyang but also among Bakwiri themselves. They are also documented by Edwin Ardener (1970) who worked at that time among the Bakwiri. In his very insightful article he explained why the Bakwiri needed Obasinjom at a time when their economic situation visibly ameliorated due to the banana boom of the 1950s. Geschiere (2001: 47-52) relates that Obasinjom had solved witchcraft and nyongo fears for long, and when in the late 1980s the problems started anew, Obasinjom was bought once more for a high price. In the early 1990s it was abandoned, however, because the youth found out that it was corrupted by the elders. Obasinjom was neither the only nor the first cult agency sold so far away from the Cross River area. Basel missionaries (ABM Stolz 1912: 16) and colonial officers (CNA Afam Juju) mention others like Njom and Mfam already in the 1910s and 1920s among the Bakwiri at the coast. This traffic in culture usually worried the colonial officials: 'The introduction of the Obasi Njom juju into Victoria Division caused a considerable amount of trouble' (CNA Wright 26.4.1958). Obasinjom reached the coast at Mount Cameroon so far from its main area of dissemination not by chance. Bakwiri could have acquired Obasinjom '6 According to Murray, the 'Akpambe juju' came from the 'town of Okorara [Okarara] (up in Oban) to Etubom Okon Efiom Antikha [in Akpabuyo]' (RHL Murray 1921-7). This was confirmed by Okarara and Oban; see also Aye (1994: 63) for the names of the settlements. It also reached the Efik at Calabar where Aye calls it Idem Ibok (Efik: 'the face of the cult agency') or Offiom Inyang (see 'Efik dances' 1957: 162, photograph). 17 According to the Ogyebili of the Obol Lopon of Ugep in 2001, the last Obasinjom performed about forty years ago. Obasinjom may have reached Enugu State under the name Akpam: Umuenwene, Iji, and Nike bought it from Okande (near Ogoja), according to Axel Harneit-Sievers (personal communication). 18 Under the name of Okpambe (see CNA Sharwood-Smith and Cantle n.d.). This was confirmed by an elder from Mbiamesu (Anyang) in Mamfe who said they sold it as far away as Matene near Akwaya.</page><page sequence="24">264 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM from the Mbonge, but they wished to have it from nearer to its source. They got to know about it because there existed marriage relations of Bakwiri with Ejagham and Banyang who had migrated to the coast to work on the plantations (Ardener et al. 1960; Chilver and R6schenthaler 2001). Generally, villagers argued that the first criterion for choosing the community from which to buy an association was its original place of invention, or a village that had become prominent in its performance. Yet, one also needed some kind of relationship to arrange for a transaction, for example, by trade or by marriage, otherwise one had to cope with a high risk of being cheated. Lacking such contacts, in the end, many communities never went very far for an acquisition. THE TRANSACTION PROCESS After its alleged invention in Mbinda or Okuri, Obasinjom had been sold to more than a hundred different villages. The reasons that were given for buying Obasinjom were similar in the various localities: there was an increase of misfortunes the social origin of which needed revelation. Etinkem villagers, for example, remembered that they bought their Obasinjom variation called Nsibiri 'at a time when many goats were killed by leopards' [who were imagined to be hungry fellow villagers in disguise]. They 'tied the Nsibiri [medicine] to the goats and then the leopards gradually died'. An Obasinjom member in Kembong explained: 'There was a time we were not yet born, when we got some very bad witchcraft. People were annoyed by that time. Some people had well growing children, then the witches transformed into the shape of the tiger [leopard] and seduced them to follow them in the forest where the witches slaughtered and consumed them. So we heard that there is Obasinjom towards Calabar and we brought it here, and it killed all the people who killed our children.'19 Most villages already owned a number of other cult agencies which could also deal with witches before they acquired Obasinjom. They argued that Obasinjom was still needed instead or additionally. He could do the job better because he was 'Obasi-Njom', the 'God of all the cult agencies', and therefore superior to the others. And he was more entertaining because of his impressive masquerade. The transaction was a complicated process, the more so since Obasinjom was the most complex of all Ejagham cult agencies. Not only did it have the several performers each of whom had to be trained in their tasks, it also included three to five grades through which members were initiated. To make it work effectively, a community needed enough members to occupy the posts and represent the grades. Therefore, a 19 It is accidental that both quotations are about leopards. It could as well have been bush pigs, elephants or other destructive animals thought to be witches in disguise or sent by the latter, or any other type of pervasive misfortune originating from one or the other type of witchcraft. Obasinjom also divined theft or false statements, but I have not heard of these having been the reason for the acquisition of the njom.</page><page sequence="25">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 265 small village was more suited to owning a normal cult agency as, for example, did Eyang Mange with its famous Moninjom. They never owned Obasinjom themselves, but joined the one of the neighbouring Onaku. The posts of Obasinjom were each owned by individual lineages. At the beginning of the transaction, the founding lineages decided who among them would buy and own which post. An Obasinjom member in Kembong explained: 'When ... you have given money for Manjom, let's say ?3.50, then Manjom belongs to your family.' It also owned the privilege to recruit a representative from its descendants and was rewarded with specific (economic) advantages by the Obasinjom group for this job. In addition, the posts were the grades into which individual members were initiated and through which they ascended on the payment of initiation fees. Members of the post-owning founding lineages would get to the upper grades, other members probably never reached further than the first or second stage. The names of the grades and posts themselves were not secret but the activities behind them belonged to the knowledge which had to be bought and the members interviewed revealed little more than the names.20 The names of the grades varied from village to village: 1. Okwa, the initial or primary stage, sometimes also called Atimambi (Ebot 1978: 445). During initiation a live dog was said to be required for a meal. These primary members were sent as messengers for errands, followed orders and did the drumming and singing at performances. 2. The ebhunjom and some of the other performers and drummers, the translator excluded. 3. The atui njom, the chiefs and elders of the njom, formed the highest grade. Among them were the asomenjom (translator), the chiefs in charge of the medicines in the sacred forest, and the ebhanga nnenjom who performed the ritual at the shrine and the head of the mask. The tree called 'king stick' was associated with Obasinjom and reputed for its deadly powers which were made visible by the empty circle around its stem where no plant or animal would live. The sacred forest was said to have two sections: 1. The ekpinon forest for the general initiation. The initiants had to strike the tree of which the bark and roots were used to prepare the medicine to appease (ajaw njom) the Obasinjom cult agency. 2. The eyantim forest was reserved for the initiation lodges of the upper grades. This stage was also called manyama. Only four or five members of a village would enter this stage. It was dangerous and put the medicine on the road: should somebody cross that road, the power of the medicine would kill him. 20 In addition to my own research, the grades have been discussed briefly by Ojaghe (1995: 20), U. Agbor (1997), Victor Oben (1987), Ebot (1978: 445). See also Nicklin and Salmon (1984: 34 f.) who refers to Ruel (1969) and Thompson (1974).</page><page sequence="26">266 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM PLATE 5 Entrance to the Obasinjom sacred forest of Ossing village, January 2000. (Photo: Ute R6schenthaler) The transaction of an Obasinjom was carefully negotiated. When talking about how and from where they got their Obasinjom and to describe these transactions, most Ejagham used the local terms nam ('buying') and guri ('selling'), others preferred the terms tongo ('showing', 'teaching'), ko ('taking', 'obtaining') or ogem ('marketing'). The acquisition of a cult agency (njom) or an association (okum) entailed knowledge about the performance of the society's dances and songs, how to fill the posts, initiate new members, employ them for its aims, as well as to manipulate the objects and supply them with power or agency-in short the knowledge necessary to operate the entire association successfully. It also implied the acquisition of rights to possess and display insignia and other objects, and, to a certain extent, rights in the institution's specific songs and performances. Knowledge was not only transacted in a hierarchical way from the top downwards, from knowledgeable elders to younger initiants (by initiation into the institution), but also between villages (by purchase) as equal partners. The knowledge that constituted the society's real source of power and rights was treated as incorporeal (Lowie 1921) or intellectual property (Harrison 1992), but was different from the specialist knowledge described by Guyer and Belinga (1995) for Equatorial Africa that enabled individuals to become 'Big Men'. First, the council of the village desiring the institution officially approved the decision to buy it from a particular village. Then a delegation was sent to the village owning the desired institution to negotiate the possibility and the conditions of the transaction. Not in every case were they ready to sell the institution. They inquired into</page><page sequence="27">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 267 the future buyers' lineage histories. Once a sale was agreed, the price was discussed. It could be acquired all at once but also in instalments. Next the owners visited the interested village. They stayed for about two weeks during which the secret knowledge was taught and practised. During this time the teachers were served food and drinks as part of the compensation. If the buyers were too stingy, the teachers would retaliate by retaining some of the secrets. Thereupon the new owners made them swear in front of another cult agency that they had disclosed all the secrets. In turn, the teachers did not leave until they were of the opinion that the association was well established, the knowledge in good hands and everything paid. The deal was concluded by a big feast and a public performance. When the transaction was complete, the new owners were able to initiate new members and usually also to sell the entire institution to another community. The new owners were considered to be more or less independent owners-this varied from njom to njom. Some widespread cult agencies, such as Obasinjom and associations (akum) such as Ngbe, formed networks of cooperation, of mutual responsibilities and advantages. They expected the new owners to cooperate in diplomatic matters and to invite each other to important festivities concerning the acquired institution. The most conspicious and efficient network formed by cult agencies was put in place by Ngbe (Ekpe). Ngbe was at the same time the least commoditised association because the relationship between buyers and sellers established the most compelling network. Rare or singular institutions and dance associations preferred to be more independent. Because no relations between buyers and sellers were desired, dance associations were perhaps the most commoditised forms of such transactable institutions. The members of the dance association Oyim Ntim of Babong, for example, insisted that they did not want any further relations with the owners from whom they had acquired the association and enjoyed their independence free from obligations. In turn, they found that others imitated their performance. The league that for example Ngbe formed, with its large network of member villages, was able actively to prevent plagiarism. The network of cult agencies such as Obasinjom was formed more for professional reasons. Because its agency worked by public performance as well as by secrecy, Obasinjom was not subject to imitation. The secrets and the knowledge were not visible, they could only be sold or betrayed. Obasinjom was not sold in every case. There were localities that just wished to hire Obasinjom to perform for them when they faced a serious problem of witchcraft. Obasinjom was known far beyond the ends of its dissemination frontier. The Obasinjom of Ossing divined in Limbe-Sokolo. The one of Nchang was hired to perform in Bakundu as well as many other places. Obasinjom had recently been invited to work three times in Kumba, three times in Small Soppo, in Muyuka, Balangi and in Babanki. It also worked in Bamenda, in Bambi (Bafang) and even in the Western Province. A member in Kembong remembered that they had performed at Balangi because some people had killed a young man while they were pushing a car. The young man had fallen</page><page sequence="28">268 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM under the car and was killed instantly. Obasinjom was called to reveal whether this was due to witchcraft by one of these other men. On such occasions the customers paid for the hiring of the transport as well as for food, lodging, and a divination fee. Such hirings of Obasinjom were also remembered by people from Kumba, Bali, Menji, Tiben and Bafut. CHANGES IN THE ORGANISATION AND THE CREDIBILITY OF OBASINJOM Cult agencies appear already to have increased in number during the time of the slave trade. People feared the increasing number of foreign persons whom they placed in separate slave settlements (Fomin and Ngoh 1998). Due to their acting as middlemen the local elites disposed of wealth part of which they invested in the acquisition of institutions. The early prohibition of the poison ordeal by missionaries and colonial powers at Calabar might constitute an additional reason for the increase of cult agencies-in the hinterland too, as most of the latter came from a south-westerly direction following trade routes. The early accounts (Talbot 1912; Mansfeld 1908; and others) already make mention of cult agencies and associations at that time in nearly every village, but we don't know for certain how long they had already existed. Obasinjom was one of the latest invented cult agencies. Both associations and cult agencies continued to be disseminated during colonial times and up until today. With the arrival of missionaries and the colonial governments in person in the hinterland, the cult agencies' power to uncover the truth became disputed.21 The German government, for example, initially prohibited cult agencies as well as associations in the Kumba area because these were believed to be subversive (Conradt 1900). Mansfeld (1908) later thought associations such as Ngbe could be useful for the propagation of government interests. The British considered the cult agency Mfam at times useful in court when a binding oath had to be taken (see for example CNA Rutherford 18.7.1923), yet put other institutions on the proscribed list. In the course of the second third of the twentieth century Obasinjom experienced a decrease in credibility. In the 1930s, Basel missionaries increasingly sought to weaken its authority. In 1938, for example, the Basel missionary Peyer managed to seize the 'horn' of Obasinjom in Bachuo Ntai. In 1952, when Pastor Sango found the church empty because Obasinjom was performing, he seized its 'trumpet' and attempted to beat the mask but failed (Agbor 1997). The chief of Manyemen also remembered the story of Peyer in Bachuo Ntai, adding that Peyer had thrown the mask into the water to destroy it. In other villages Obasinjom was suspended because the villagers 21 The time span between the arrival of Europeans at the coast and the hinterland of the Cross River area is up to fifty years. In the Cameroonian Ejagham area (Ekok), the first German colonial administrators came only in 1895, and missionaries in 1912 (Ossing). Scottish missionaries had already arrived at Calabar in 1846.</page><page sequence="29">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 269 themselves demasked it as corrupt (in Lobe-Balundu and in Okuni where it had been dead since the 1930s). In an Etung village Obasinjom had lost credibility when a Jehovah's Witness threw a masquerader to the ground. Keith Nicklin and Jill Salmons (1984: 34 f.) quote Kenneth Murray (n.d.) as having noticed a decrease of interest in Obasinjom on his visit to Etung in 1948, whereas when they themselves visited villages of Etung-Ejagham and western Boki in the 1970s, they found that Obasinjom was still widespread. In none of the studied villages was an Obasinjom shrine standing in the centre of the village. It was always said to be in the secret forest of the cult agency near the borders of the village. Yet Talbot mentioned that during his time he had seen the Obasinjom shrine of Okuri in the village itself. Other ajom however continued to have their shrines in the village centre albeit no longer with carved anthropomorphic images. In the villages under study around the Ejagham country, Obasinjom had been given up altogether earlier or easier than among the Ejagham themselves. Some gave it up only recently, others as long as fifty years ago. In some cases only the mask was unusable or missing, or it had found a new meaning in a museum. The Obasinjom objects of the Boki village of Biakwan and the Etung village of Etome are now in the National Museum of Oron, and in these villages Obasinjom do not perform anymore because they have not commissioned new objects for their Obasinjom.22 In Kurume (Bafaw) Obasinjom was said to have been seriously beaten by gendarmes because he was unable to find guns that had disappeared and that he had claimed to be able to see. Most Mbonge villages once owned Obasinjom, but it was given up and the cult agency Mfam-which in the Ejagham country is senior in age to Obasinjom-was introduced instead. Other reasons for giving up Obasinjom were church membership, internal corruption or a decrease in membership altogether. Still other villages were interested in reviving it. Despite this decrease in power, during the time of my research the villages under study still had one or two village-owned cult agencies, some even five or six-not to mention the personal cult agencies. Only two of the villages did not maintain a village cult agency anymore. In towns such as Calabar and Mamfe cult agencies were in private ownership only.23 Over several decades, members of the more prominent ajom have increasingly registered their cult agencies at the Ministry of Cultural Affairs of their Province in Cameroon. (This is also true for associations, 22 In 2001, the villagers of Etome and Biakwan-Abontakon remembered Keith Nicklin as having been very kind to them, inquired about his whereabouts and were very pleased to hear that I myself had seen the mask and objects in the Museum of Oron in 1988 (for a drawing of the shrine, see Nicklin n.d.), and that I personally had paid Jill Salmons and Keith Nicklin a visit in their country house in England in 1999. 23 Each of the villages owned an average of four cult agencies of which one or two usually did not function anymore. Of the eighty-one researched villages under study, eighteen owned four ajom (usually one of them already dead), thirteen owned three ajom, and nine owned five ajom. Villagers usually mentioned dead ajom only when they had recently ceased to function.</page><page sequence="30">270 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM and similar developments can be observed in the Cross River State of Nigeria.)24 Armed with an official paper of registration, they are able to travel with their insignia and cult objects to other places when hired without being questioned by police controls on their way. The Obasinjom of Ossing claimed to have been invited to perform as far away as Duala with their licence 'because of all the big snakes who carry big money from shops', that is to say, because of mysterious cases of deaths of innocent people, which scholars have repeatedly described from other areas (Harnischfeger 1997; Comaroff and Comaroff 1999; Smith 2001). For a similar reason, the Balong village of Baro was asked to perform its Obasinjom or Asunka right in Duala. These developments represent a more recent parallel to the Nyongo witchcraft felt to be so disturbing at the beginning of the banana boom in the 1950s around Mount Cameroon and which had resulted in the many acquisitions of Obasinjom at that time among the Bakwiri (Ardener 1970; Fisiy and Geschiere 1996; Geschiere 2001).25 Despite its impressive dissemination history and despite attempts to weaken its influence-on the part of colonial governments, missionaries and, in recent years, the pentecostal churches trying to gain a foothold even in remote villages-Obasinjom was far from being a dead institution between 1998 and 2001. Of the sixty-six Obasinjom in Ejagham villages having owned the cult agency (forty-one in Cameroon, Kembong has two, fifteen in Nigeria), only eighteen (sixteen in Cameroon and two in Nigeria) were no longer functioning. Forty- eight still had a functioning Obasinjom. During the time of my research-perhaps accidentally-I did not witness the acquisition of a village-owned cult agency (njom), but I encountered the transaction of at least ten associations (akum) of different types, and more communities had just begun to engage in the process of negotiation. As a result of fears about Obasinjom's decrease in power, the Manyu Obasinjom Association was formed in March 1999. It aimed to consolidate and coordinate all Obasinjom powers and to save Obasinjom knowledge and the institution as a whole. It united all Obasinjom within Manyu Division which comprised Ejagham, Banyang, Boki and Anyang villages. The formation was initiated by the chief of the Obasinjom of one village, although he does not seem to have any special say in the organisation, the meetings of which strictly rotate around all the member 24 On the one hand, the people feared that the administration considered Obasinjom as potentially disturbing the order because of its divinations. I had such an impression particularly in the late 1980s. Owners knew that they were supposed to have a licence for performing but did not want to spend the money needed for registration. On the other hand, the official registrations and the creation of the registered pan-Obasinjom Association in 2000 was not welcome by all Ejagham, especially not by young non-members who feared a state-backed increase of its powers (cf. Rowlands and Warnier 1988). 25 Nyungo was known in the Cross River area in Ejagham and Banyang villages and towns as mainly an urban phenomenon. Its machinations were discussed in the villages since most families had relatives living in towns. The villages themselves were not thought to be infected by Nyungo but it had happened that rich relatives had used innocent village children who had been sent to town for education in Nyungo.</page><page sequence="31">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 271 villages.26 The association implemented a number of binding decisions for all member Obasinjom associations. A village could no longer sell Obasinjom and divide the gains among its own members, but had to involve the entire Obasinjom association. Some members even insisted that the sale of Obasinjom should be restricted to Manyu Division itself. Localities that required the expertise of Obasinjom should only be able to hire Obasinjom for a performance. So in the global age of commercialisation of knowledge the Manyu Obasinjom Association restricted the marketing of its knowledge again, and in fact tried to limit its uncontrolled diffusion outside of Manyu Division. CONCLUSION The dissemination of Obasinjom into large parts of the Cross River area that mainly took place during the twentieth century represents the history of a particularly successful cult agency. This success was attributed to its supreme powers and its wonderful masquerade performance that other cult agencies did not use. Obasinjom spread rapidly over the area, but in contrast to many witch-hunting cults in other parts of Africa it usually did not disappear after the completion of the immediate job for which it had been acquired. Its acquisition should not be reduced to functional considerations. The transaction that entailed the acquisition of knowledge, rights in the performance and the objects was not only accomplished in order to solve a virulent problem or for a definite reason. Their owners also desired to possess the institution because their possession created wealth, influence and prestige for their owners as well as their village as a whole. Owning associations (akum) and cult agencies (ajom) involved an accumulation of knowledge. In political terms, a community that owned a large number of associations and cult agencies also owned most of the knowledge available in the region. No other community could provoke them. Thus, by acquiring cult agencies, societies and their objects, the local elites-the village chief with his council of members of founding lineages-tried to accumulate culture and knowledge, even if the functions or services of the various institutions thereby became redundant. The success of the institutions' management depended to a large extent on the wise use by their members of their powers to perform. If their use and their imparting were not controlled at all, the secret knowledge would be misused, circulate widely and become worthless. Despite its widespread dissemination, and the challenges of colonisation, the churches and the modem state, Obasinjom continued in its core area to be alive for at least a hundred years. The ownership of the same institution shaped relations between villages in the area by creating networks that linked together those 26 It is too early yet to make any further diagnosis or draw conclusions on the effects of this pan-Obasinjom association as it was founded only a few years ago.</page><page sequence="32">272 TRANSACTING OBASINJOM communities who had purchased an institution from each other. The common ownership of institutions played a decisive role in inter-village competition when associations were about to be invited or hired to stage a performance. Thus, all those who owned the same cultural institution were, on the one hand, independent and competing owners and, on the other hand, part of a network that could grow transethnic (and transnational) without being influenced by a centre-a network of distributed but controlled secret knowledge, uniting members, objects and associations for political, economic or social reasons. At this stage it is difficult to offer a prognosis of the changes for the network that the creation of the Manyu Obasinjom Association will bring about in the future. In the process of the institutions' dissemination a series of unique but similar objects were created that became meaningful and developed agency in the context of the institution. They were vehicles for the visualisation of its power and greatness. The institutions were not com- moditised in the sense that everybody interested was allowed to acquire them. The dissemination of the institutions was generally restricted to communities whose history was known and who were the owners of the land. With the dissemination of associations and cult agencies peaceful relationships were established. Yet, in the Cross River area, neither objects nor institutions circulate in the sense that they were intended to come back to their owners some time in the future. With time these institutions and their objects disseminated further away to other areas. The strategies behind the dissemination of institutions had a more exploratory character. Their owners did not wish objects to return, they wanted new objects different from others, and the control over other people without being controlled themselves. Despite having created a network (without a controlling centre), their owners each participated in controlling the dissemination process. The institutions were not com- moditised in the sense that they were simply disseminated by criteria of supply and demand, the owners decided in each case anew whether they were ready to impart the institution. On the one hand, the uncen- tralised villages did not wish to work together too closely and under one authority (Fisiy and Geschiere 1996) and, on the other, in order to make institutions such as Obasinjom more effective, they had to find forms of cooperation. Owning the same institution produced a feeling of identity between the owners; yet a consciousness of all owners having an institution in common existed only among neighbouring communities. Nevertheless, the notion of a biography of the entire institution emerged solely when the partial histories collected in the different villages were put together to form a whole. Such a biography is an artificial product which exists only through anthropological research and endeavour. A biography of institutions includes its bifurcations and multiplications in time and space over the area; and, differing from Kopytoffs approach, this institutional framework binds together knowledge, objects and persons. The institutions diffused further away in the network and the owners had no certain knowledge of the other</page><page sequence="33">TRANSACTING OBASINJOM 273 participants. The recently created Manyu Obasinjom Association, how- ever, has changed the situation: it has created a sense of identity and a feeling of greater unity and consciousness amongst all those participants in the larger association owning Obasinjom, Ekuri Ebhok and Asunka. But it has confined this consciousness to villages in the Manyu Division, excluding villages in other Divisions and all those in Nigeria. REFERENCES Agbor, E. U. 1997.

ABSTRACT During the twentieth century, Obasinjom became one of the best known and most effective cult agencies in the Cross River area of Cameroon and Nigeria. This paper aims at reconstructing the history of Obasinjom and some of its variants. Unlike many other witch-hunting cults, Obasinjom usually did not disappear after accomplishing the immediate job for which it was acquired. The owners additionally desired to possess the institution because it created wealth, influence and prestige for them as well as their village as a whole. Obasinjom and other cult agencies (as well as women's and men's societies and dance associations) spread from village to village across ethnic or language boundaries. Along with their dissemination, something of their identities and agency diffused and was incorporated into their histories over time and space. As intellectual property they were owned by the buying village and at the same time remained the property of the selling village. Obasinjom, as well as more important institutions, created decentralised networks of owners who had no definite knowledge of all the other participants. The recently formed pan-Obasinjom association, however, has changed this situation and, at least among some owners, created a feeling of identity and a greater sense of unity. RESUME Au cours du vingtieme siecle, l'obasinjom est devenu l'une des institutions de culte les plus connues et les mieux organisees de la region de Cross River au Cameroun et au Nigeria. Cet article cherche a reconstruire l'histoire de l'obasinjom et certaines de ses variantes. Contrairement a beaucoup d'autres cultes de chasse aux sorcieres, I'obasinjom n'a pas generalement disparu une fois achevee la tache immediate auquel il &amp;tait destine. Les proprietaires desiraient en outre posseder l'institution car creatrice de richesse, d'influence et de prestige pour eux-memes comme pour leur village. L'obasinjom et d'autres institutions de culte (ainsi que des soci&amp;tes de femmes et d'hommes, et des associations de danse) se sont repandus de village en village, au-dela des frontieres ethniques ou linguistiques. En meme temps que leur dissemination, une partie de leur identit6 et action s'est diffusee et integr"e dans leur histoire au fil du temps et de l'espace. En tant que propri&amp;te intellectuelle, ils appartenaient au village acquereur, mais demeuraient la propri&amp;t6 du village vendeur. L'obasinjom, comme d'autres institutions plus importantes, a cre6 des reseaux decentralises de proprietaires sans connaissance definie des autres participants. L'association pan-obasinjom recemment constitute a cependant change cette situation et cree, du moins chez certains proprietaires, un sentiment d'identite et un sens d'unite plus large.</page></plain_text>
