THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Ingrid D. Rowland Giancarlo Maiorino. The Portrait of Eccentricity: Archimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque. University Park and London: Pennsylvania State University Press, I99I. 31 pls. + xi + 170 pp. $25. What is more perfect than perfection? That paradoxical question propels Giancarlo Maiorino on a speculative exploration of Man- nerism in its theoretical, rhetorical, and visual forms. He takes his question from a phrase of Vasari's, "una molto piiu assoluta perfe- zione." "Una" suggests to him the relativity of perfection, and "molto piu assoluta" invokes something in excess of perfection, a departure or exaggeration that he identifies as the essence (or rather, in this context, the anti-essence) of Mannerism. Through his teas- ing of linguistic pattern, Maiorino releases a series of propositions: that Mannerism creates an excess that undermines sufficiency, that it is characterized by a shift from noun to adjective (e.g. from "per- fezione" to its qualifiers: "una piu molto assoluta") and from es- sence to appearance, and that, through its excess, Mannerism re- veals how classicism is, by contrast, an aesthetic of parsimony. Maiorino pursues this line of inquiry by reference to Giorgio Vasari, who initially defines the project of Mannerism, Guiseppe Archimboldo, who executes it, and Gregorio Comanini, who ex- plicates what Archimboldo has done. The core, then, is Archim- boldo, or rather (since Maiorino has little interest in the artist him- self, and consciously avoids psychological inquiry), the "portraits" in which groups of objects-fish, vegetables, books, cookware- are assembled into human figures. Following the technique of Ro- land Barthes at mid-career, Maiorino pursues analogies between rhetorical figures and larger representational structures. Hence Archimboldo's use of, say, a fish to represent a human nose is the visual equivalent of the verbal figure antanaclasis, the repetition of a word with a different meaning. From this primacy of rhetoric over representation, Maiorino suggests that mimesis is destabilized, 872</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS verisimilitude itself becomes just another rhetorical figure, the su- premacy of Raphael is undermined, dominant ideologies crumble, and so forth. The leap from figurative transgression to the more profound transgressions of thought, society, and culture is clearly a difficult one. At times, Maiorino describes mannerist "eccentricity" as if it were carnival going on insurrection. "Transgressions of all sorts fed the imagination, and an emergent poetics of surprise stormed the arts. To stir wonder, artists made of the unexpected a predom- inant mode of artistic invention" (34). At other moments, he con- cedes that this is more smoke than fire. Maiorino finally opts for something in between, conceding that Mannerism deals more with figures of speech than of thought, and so offers a "liminal" pleasure by always staying at the margins of the dominant structures without forcibly reordering them. But that concession may come too easily, leaving open the question of how such potentially destabilizing structures could in the end be ren- dered benign. A more ruthless rhetorical analysis would move us toward an answer. Does that Archimboldesque fish represent a nose, or is it the other way around, the nose representing the fish? Why do we give interpretative primacy to large-scale structures over small ones, claiming that the fish add up to a picture of a man, instead of believing that a picture of a man is used to depict our finny friends? In the fascinating vegetative portrait identified si- multaneously as "Vertumnus" and "The Emperor Rudolph II," Maiorino recognizes that "at the same time, the picture is a portrait and an antiportrait" in which "the anthropomorphic figure there- fore hides nature behind both myth [Vertumnus] and history [Ru- dolph]" (80-8I). Again this hyperzeugmic analysis of both/and leaves us short of the looming questions: why should we accept the claim that this figure "represents" either Vertumnus or Rudolph? Does it undermine or magically reaffirm the "orthodox" portraits of emperors as pagan gods or Davidic kings? Did Rudolph like it? The difficulty with the whole line of analysis, as Barthes himself recognized by the time he wrote S/Z, is that the linguistic- structural method cannot by itself differentiate between the revo- lutionary action of the masses and the parlor games of the idle classes. To do so, at least a vague gesture toward social history is necessary, and preferably, the still-mysterious link between 873</page><page sequence="3">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY sophistry and social action could come under scrutiny. Ironically, in a work that styles itself as daringly progressive, Maiorino's mode of argument is again nostalgic. If his linguistic method belongs at heart to the mid-6o's, his invocations of a wider cultural history have a 30's or 40's air about them, as they are couched in the sweep- ing and impersonal generalizations of a late-stage Geistesgeschichte. For instance: Adumbrations of nature gained strength in the practice of the arts, and eccen- tricity explored bizarre regions of artistic invention (62). Lodged as it was between pictorial ambiguity and linguistic indirections, the mannerist Flora visualized a kind of parasitic growth that fed on Humanism but rejected the new life system of the Baroque. Bruno was committed to "make everything of everything" because he believed in a transformational view of life (87). This is a stylishly retro redoing of the history of ideas, louder and wider than the original. The problems that always plagued the his- tory of ideas - problems of causality and of universality - are only compounded by being linked to a technique of linguistic analysis that is consciously ungrounded and incomplete and consciously mimics its subject. The phenomenon of Mannerism has always been challenging precisely because it poses the problem of how figures of speech carry over into figures of thought and figures of culture. The prob- ing analyses over the past decades by Shearman, Mirollo, and oth- ers have in various ways looked for visually and philologically exact instances of linkage among these spheres. If Mannerism can indeed be conceived of as a general category-and that is a very big "if" for a group of phenomena so diverse in time, place, style, and content-its general quality may be precisely its disruption of those linkages, its denial of homologies between spheres of expression, thought, and culture. These denials are as often trivial as profound; Archimboldo may not hold much shock for modern viewers who grew up playing with Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. But the task to cultural criticism remains, that of finding a vocabulary and meth- odology of adequate sophistication to describe the linkages among cultural spheres in all their nuances and fragility.
