<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cover An Unprovenanced Teotihuacan-Style Figurine This sculpture, 46 cm high and made of a mottled green and white stone, depicts an anthropomorphic standing figure with a geometric ornamentation on the chest and shows a tufted hair-style (see cover; front and side view). The high headdress has been interpreted as representing a ballcourt with a stylized maize cob on top. No provenance of the figurine is known and it could date to A.D. 200-700. The artifact was part of a private collection in France since 1974 and is held now of a private collector in Switzerland since 1999. Text: Anton Saurwein Photos: mexicon archives</page></plain_text>
