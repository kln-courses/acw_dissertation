SHAFER THE other day one of my students burst out, "If men want peace, they'll have to eliminate or change their histories. We ought to have a history of men, not just these national things." He thought that he had a new idea; it was new to him. Aristotle, of course, thought of it as he did of everything else, and so have occasional historians and social scientists ever since. Thirty years ago the prophet H. G. Wells prefaced his Outline of History with "There can be no common peace and prosperity without com- mon historical ideas."' Historians do not write to propagandize for "peace and prosperity." The proper end of scholarly endeavor is the discovery of truth or the closest approximation to it. The first duty of a historian is to search for truth about the human past, to describe it and interpret it, "wie es eigenlich gewesen ist." If the historian first seeks any other end, he, like any other scholar, is denying his own reason for existence and refusing the primary though not the only responsibility of his profession. When he uses his craft for good or bad propaganda, fits facts to his prejudice, consciously or stupidly errs in logic 1 H. G. Wells, The Outline of History (3d ed., New York, I921), pp. V-Vi.

Shafer to reach a predetermined point of view, he is neither historian nor scholar. But these are just the obvious types of error that modern historians may make. There is another kind of error that leads them from truth, from scholar- ship, from history. This they usually commit in good faith and without conscious design. It is seeing men first of all and almost only as nationalities, races, classes, above all in Western civilization in viewing men almost exclusively in terms of national groups, therefore as but fragments of men particularly as these are differentiated from other fragments.2 The customary method of historians in our times, and for the last two centuries, has been to write national histories, to study national institutions, to attempt solution of national problems. It is easier and more convenient, the material can be more readily collected and synthesized, they themselves are nationalists, it is politic, and it has become a tradition. They also do it because the nation has become the most important social unit and the most obvious one to study. People in our time live in nation-states, and possess national consciousness; most of their vital activities are carried on within the framework of the nation-state. Moreover, as practitioners of the scientific method, scholars are bound to look for distinctions, for differences based on kind, level, and function; and nationality is the most significant contempo- rary group distinction. Our Western civilization, and this is one of the marks of a highly civilized society, teaches its intelligent men to look for variations from whatever seems to be the norm and to classify these within closed, schematic concepts. This, in the present case, usually means study of national thought and action, not the universal or local. Our whole scholarly orientation is toward the elaboration of the differences rather than concentration upon commonness or similarity. Whatever the cause the modern Gibbons, Voltaires, Buckles, Guizots, and Andrew D. Whites3 are few and the standard works, with few excep- tions, are histories of this or that nation, national idea, or institution. This way of looking at men has validity; it is not always false; it is often the only way historians, for example, can get at anything tangible-most modern documents are produced by national institutions. But to study men as if they existed only in segments, to ignore what they have in common and how they are alike is not to approximate the whole truth. It is partial, incomplete, and 2 Thus the late Robert C. Binkley in his bibliographical essay in Realism and Nationalism, 1852-1871 (New York, 1935), p. 307, had to remark, "The principal lacunae in European History of this period is a deficiency of histories of Europe." Except for American textbooks usually divided into chapters on each nation, this is true of all periods of European history since i8i5. 3 See his plea as first president of the American Historical Association in his address "On Studies in General History and the History of Civilization," I884, Papers American Historical Association, I (New York, i886), 49-72.</page><page sequence="3">Men Are More Alike 595 in a sense false. It is also incidentally one way to court the destruction of all men. The historians are not alone. Like them, twentieth-century diplomats, scientists, journalists, and novelists have all been trained by their education and conditioned by their societies to seek the different, to bring out the peculiarities, and to build their policies, their theses, and their stories upon these, not upon the likenesses among men. In their sometimes well-meaning, sometimes self-seeking efforts to foster their own countries' interests, to classify types scientifically, to gain popularity (or circulation) by catering to prejudice, and to bring out the novel or esoteric, they have nearly all over- looked the simple fact that men as individuals and men in groups are in many ways more alike than different. In the nature of their trade diplomats act, as Robert Sherwood remarks in Roosevelt and Hopkins, not for men but for particular men.4 From Aristotle onward science has been, in part, the art of observing, distinguish- ing, and classifying phenomena-which in most cases means the establish- ment of convenient resemblances which differentiate specific objects from all other objects. Journalism, from its beginning, and especially since Hearst, has been the business of selling news, that is the odd or the new, and their customers have bought more papers when the superiority of their own peculiarities has been confirmed by comparison with others'. Novelists beginning with Fielding have delighted in depicting the national (not the common) character of men, becoming therefore not just novelists but English, French, or Russian novelists.5 In all fields of writing, with the possible exception of some in pure science, authors have usually attempted to describe their subjects not only in terms of properties within the subjects themselves but also as peculiar to a particular race, class, or nation. Since the eighteenth century few intellectuals have been able to see men as man. Even the apostles of Marxian internationalism have succumbed to national- ism. We may poke fun at the American schoolmarm who in France des- perately desires her orange juice and Kohler plumbing. She is evincing the same provincialism on a superficial level as the social scientist on a deeper level who studies only the national mind, the national problems, and sees only these and not man. Immediately it must be granted that differences exist among individuals and among societies. Immediately it must be admitted that differences of 4Robert Sherwood, Roosevelt and Hopkins (New York, 1948), p. 796. 5 Professor Albert Guerard recently attacked the teaching of "English" rather than "litera- ture" as narrow, provincial, and impossible because literature is world literature and related by other than national ideas.

Shafer culture based upon climate, physiology, class, nation, and possibly race war- rant all manner of intensive scientific research. The study of these, however, ought to be tempered by realization and study of similarities that are at least as important. Homo sapiens is a species!6 Within the species varieties occur. But as with the trees and forests the varieties ought not obscure the view. It is upon certain aspects of the common nature and common cultural development of the species that this essay is focused. II Someday new mutations may occur which break up the species. As yet man is a single species and there is no evidence that this kind of cleavage impends. This is true in spite of all the findings of the young sciences of man, psychology and anthropology, and of all the descriptions of men found in the older disciplines of history and political economy. It is true though the studies and writings of Galton, Binet, Frazer, Childe, Marx, Sombart, Kohn, and Hertz have been convincing in their conclusions about individual, tribal, class, and national differences. Men vary; the study of their variations has given us important insights into man's actions. Nevertheless, we know little about the fundamental nature of man, not to speak of nations and races. There are few truly scien- tific studies. While there has been extended observation there has been little experimentation. There is, consequently, little real evidence that will serve for more than tentative hypotheses. What we have of positive nature on national and racial differences still does not go far beyond the random comments of such intelligent men as David Hume, the biased books of racialists like Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and the enter- taining guesses of popular writers like Madariaga, Siegfried, and Demiash- kevich.7 What we know is largely of negative nature. What we ought to realize about all men in regard to nationality and race is what Professor Otto Klineberg alnd his collaborators concluded from their study of the Negro: f8 The best recent book dealing with the subject is William C. Boyd, Genetics and the Races of Man (Boston, 1950). See also G. G. Simpson, "The Principles of Classification and a Classi- fication of the Mammals," Bulletin American Museum of Natural History, LXXXV (I945), 1-350. Proper classification has been a matter of vigorous dispute, often because of semantic difficulties, between some geneticists and some morphologists. Cf. Reginald R.

We venture death because of diversities which may or may not exist. Our mental habits, nurtured by science and prejudice and dignified by Aristotelian logic as well as debased by ignorance, force us to stress unlikeness, and thence it is a short road to hate and destruction. Nowhere, save for a few rare scholars, poets, and philosophers, is there full recognition of what may be after all the plainest fact about men, that they are of man. The species may not long survive; certainly it will not if social scientists seeking the complete truth do not perceive the full importance of this fundamental fact. What has been said about survival is also true if the species is to flourish. It is a truism (little recognized to be sure in contemporary Russia and the United States) that whatever "progress" men have achieved is the result of the common efforts of many men, nationalities, and races. Genius knows no national, racial, or any other boundary. Like imbecility it is uncommon in all groups, and at the same time common to all. When Russians or Americans claim a "first" they only reveal their naivete. All inventions and discoveries are built upon previous ones and these in turn, as in the case of atomic energy, came from men of many nationalities and races located everywhere on the earth and living at least as long ago as the classic Greeks (Democritus).9 The simple electric light involved among others an Italian, an Englishman, a German, a Frenchman, and an American Middle West- erner-Volta, Watt, Ohm, Ampere, and Edison. What is true here is no less true, though much less recognized, of all ideas in literature, philosophy, of all knowledge in all the arts in all civilizations. III The outward likenesses, often overlooked because they are commonplace, are easy to see. All men walk upright, and, unlike most other vertebrates, normally use stairs instead of branches. Nine tenths of the mature members of the species measure four-feet-ten to six-feet-two in height, a relatively small difference if all vertical dimensions are considered.'0 Nearly all men 8Otto Klineberg, ed., Characteristics of the American Negro (New York, 1944). 9 See, for example, Ralph Linton, The Study of Man (student ed., New York, 1936) pp. 326-27; and Paul Radin, The Racial Myth (New York, I937), pp. 8o-8i. 10 Alfred L. Kroeber, Anthropology: Race, Language, Culture, Psychology, Prehistory (rev. ed., New York, 1948), pp. I26-27, states that no race averages less than four feet ten inches and none more than five ten, while the majority of populations do not deviate more than two inches from the general average of five feet five inches.</page><page sequence="6">598 Boyd C. Shafer as adults weigh from go to 220 pounds, a small range compared to the variations in animal life. All of them require daily, though they may not get them, from 2500 to 4000 calories and a certain variety of vitamins to be gained from meat, grains, green and leafy vegetables, and fruit. With few exceptions all of them have facility for manipulating their thumbs, and for conceptual thought and speech as no other animals do. More than any other living thing they can store up knowledge, establish traditions. They are not forced to start from scratch but can, though this is rare enough, begin with the accumulated experience and wisdom of the species. Unlike the dog and the ape, men may use (though they rarely do) the spoken word and books to avoid the mistakes of their ancestors and thus determine the direction of human evolution." Though the opposite seems most often true, man is, to a greater degree than any other form of life, teachable.'2 He is at times, potentially at least, rational and the ranges of his comprehension and adaptability are wider. Men, it also seems, are singular in that they can modify what were once termed their "instincts," and may, without artificial conditioning, acquire neuroses. At the same time only they find escape in laughter and tears. Precisely because men are of man and share one planet, they everywhere face the same basic problems, those concerned with food and shelter as well as those involving social relationships and creativity in the arts. Nearly all of man's food, however refined, comes from the soil and seldom has there been too much of either land or edibles. Always shelter is needed against the rain or the sun, the heat or the cold, and seldom have the caves or the houses been plentiful. Because men are gregarious they have always had to seek how best to live together and their social problems remain basically as the Republic and the Politics stated them, freedom or authority, justice or injustice. While there are many levels of culture, man's arts have always faced similar dilemmas: material usefulness or propitiation of the gods, truth or beauty, realism or escape. Again, though there be arctic and torrid zone, hill and valley, the ranges of climate and geography which surround men are relatively narrow. Ells- worth Huntington's books which reveal so marvelously how geography and climate condition civilizations are valuable,'3 but, in spite of his bad 11 This may only be a hope. It was John Stuart Mill's belief, "Liberty," in Utilitarianism, Liberty, Representative Government (Everyman's ed.), p. 82; and is authoritatively maintained as a possibility by George Gaylord Simpson, The Meaning of Evolution (New Haven, I949). Of course, as Professor Simpson remarks, "This awesome power includes the human prerogative of self-extinction" (p. 328). 12 Linton, pp. I32 ff., summarizes some of the common characteristics. 13 Especially his Civilization and Climate (3d ed., New Haven, 1924), and Mainsprings of Civilization (New York, 1945).</page><page sequence="7">Men Are More Alike 599 astronomy, Comenius was as near the truth when he wrote, "The same sky covers us, the same sun and all the stars revolve about us, and light us in turn."'4 It is not the heat and the cold, the hills and the valleys which divide men. "Nature begins and ends everywhere and nowhere."'5 Only men set 'up the barriers which divide them, and this in itself is a common and peculiar disposition of man. Men would appear to the proverbial interspatial invader, perhaps arriving these days in flying saucers from Venus, to be scarcely distinguishable from each other. Missing the tenuous distinctions set up by men themselves, he would probably think of them as one rather unimportant type of life. He would be right. Compared to a rotifer they are huge, to a whale small, to a star infinitesimal. In terms of simple magnitude they are midway between the largest material body, the giant red star, and the smallest, the electron- "the mean between macrocosm and microcosm."'6 Their likeness, then, appears readily in their differences from other forms of matter. And if the invader turned to their spiritual nature he would perceive that everywhere on the Earth, in the words of Abdala the Saracen as reported by Pico,"7 "There is nothing to be seen more wonderful than man," and in the phrase of Innocent III, "Nothing more miserable." Again, it must be reiterated, great differences exist. The moron is not a genius. An Englishman is not a Chinese. A Comanche is not a Nordic. In the total picture perspective is nevertheless absent when these differences are given first importance. Shylock was a Jew with the "same eyes, hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions" as other men and he was "fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter" as other men.'8 The level or complexity of men's cultures condi- tion them and influence their habits and their outlooks. But the cultures are all human, men are of man, and the earth is common to all. The more closely one examines the evidence or the lack of it, the more clearly this becomes evident. IV Men are all vertebrates and mammals. They are all multicellular animals with the same kinds of nervous, blood, respiratory, and reproductive systems. 1 4 Quoted in Julian Huxley and A. C.

Shafer The same approximate percentages of chemical elements make up their bodies. So long as there are males and females reproduction between all varieties is possible, even probable. Their females all carry their young nine months and usually produce only one offspring at a time. Maturation for all offspring is comparatively slow. Unlike all other animals the desire of their adults for sexual activity is continuous: the adult male is normally capable of reproducing at any time and the adult female of about fifteen to forty-five years of age twelve times a year. Probably none of them, Lysenko notwithstanding, can inherit acquired characteristics. All of them, regardless of race or nationality, have the same few 0, A, B, and AB blood types. Though learned studies use terms like brachiocephalic and dolicho. cephalic their head shapes vary little, all being somewhat oblong. While their hair is round or oblong and straight or kinky, it is hair, and all usually have it in slightly varying intensities at the same points on their bodies. Their coloration runs from white to black but all gradations exist, while micro- scopic examination shows but slight differences in pigmentation and even these differences seem rapidly to be fading. Where differences occur, little is known of what they signify. On the basis of fact no one can say whether color, hair, head shape, or blood type have any relationship to the quality of a man, to his character, philosophy, and intelligence, or to how he will react in any circumstance. Observable differences like these may be easily classified and the classifications statistically presented in impressive, encyclopedic volumes. That is all. These particular differences occur. Nothing more can be added, no more meaning can be attached to them. In intelligence, to be sure, the gap between moron and genius may be as wide as Galton's studies and Binet's tests have shown. But both occur in all national groupings, and the gap between them is not as wide as between man, moron or genius, and other forms of life. All men above the imbecilic seem to have greater facility, though they may not use it, for reflective intelligence than do the smartest chimpanzees. On the other hand all are a bit short of omniscient gods. Further, it is impossible to disentangle the environmental factors in the formation of intelligence. No one knows to what extent intelligence is a product of a good diet and to what extent it is a part of the inherited physiological structure of the individual.20 Nor does Boyd, Kroeber, and Linton cited above, Julian Huxley, Man Stands Alone (New York, 1941); Ruth Benedict, Race: Science and Politics (New York, 1940); Franz Boas, Anthropology and Modern Life; and Melville Herskovits, Man and His Works: The Science of Cultural Anthro- pology (New York, I949). 20 For what is known concerning diet in relation to individual and national behavior, see</page><page sequence="9">Men Jre More Alike 6oi anyone know whether any particular kinds of intelligence are universally superior. In some primitive forest situations, in contemporary American college football, or in modern warfare, success most likely comes to the physically well-co-ordinated individual whom the imaginative poet might rightly consider dull and insensitive. As with intelligence so with emotions. All human creatures have the capacity for love, hate, and anger. While the depths and heights of their natures differ, capacity is common to all. The potential range and depth is greater in man than in any other animal, and which capacity is best in each situation has not been determined. Since Darwin men's differences have been transformed into a sliding scale for moral evaluation, a scale which somehow indicates inferiority and superiority.2' During the latter half of the nineteenth century men calling themselves scientists, though their interpretation of "survival of the fittest" was certainly erroneous, first erected complex classifications of human char- acteristics with the clear purpose of showing how much fitter and therefore better were some groups of men than others. Their reasoning (read Houston Stewart Chamberlain or Madison Grant for the popular versions)22 went something like this: (i) men are naturally different as is proved by their observable physical and mental traits; (2) some are naturally fitter, hence superior; (3) some races and nations are naturally fittest and therefore superior; and (4) nature and evolution made men this way and hence some races and nations should be masters and others servants. With this structure of illogic, differences became the ideological basis of social action. And further to prove superiority, the significance of the obvious differences has been deep- ened and new distinctions are fanatically sought. No intelligent man who knows anything of science and methods of scientific research need be told of the absurdity of this unreason. Though able scholars like Julian Huxley, Franz Boas, Ashley Montagu, and Ruth Benedict23 have torn away the fabric of prejudice to reveal the few known facts, the fallacies persist and must be attacked again and again.

That men differ does not indicate inferiority or superiority. If it did, that would not show that nations and races either differ or are inferior or superior. If some races and nations were superior that might not be owing to nature but to chance, cultural environment, and historical development. Who are the "fittest," the little, wiry men who formed the bulk of Rommel's North African army, the giants who play American football and basketball, the pale, bespectacled, physical scientists in the laboratories, the emaciated saints of the Middle Ages who surely went to Heaven soonest, or that "creams' of contemporary Western nations, the steel-nerved navigators and pilots of the long-range bombing planes? If it be agreed that the last are today's fittest, does it follow that their respective races or nations are? Are races and nations fittest just because they can destroy other races and nations most efficiently? Does, finally, fitness indicate anything about super- iority unless certain prejudices are accepted as absolute values? Does, indeed, survival indicate anything but luck? The survivors in the next war, as in those of the past, will very likely be those who survive-nothing more. Let us assume, however, that some nations survive and are therefore superior. There is no evidence to prove that this superiority, or any other, is natural. Rather what little knowledge we have reveals that the physical environment and cultural level of the society into which a man is born are at least as determinant in individual development as the gene and chromosome." The younger Mill was not far wrong when he wrote, "Of all the vulgar modes of escaping from the consideration of the effect of social and moral influences on the human mind, the most vulgar is that of attributing diversities of character to inherent natural differences.25 V What has been said above of the physiological diversities among men can be applied with greater force to the differences among the so-called races.28 We know that intelligence, emotional capacity and bodily structure and size 24The genetic and cultural, so far as present knowledge goes, cannot be disentangled.

In all human characteristics there is overlapping among all races; the alleged differences are chiefly in statistical averages which hide the basic similarities. That intelligent men should base any serious argument concerning men upon race is as absurd as to base diplomacy upon the consideration that one man likes his cottage cheese with garlic and another with onion.28 As everyone who reads can know, all races have ceaselessly intermixed and have become so "impure" that almost all the peculiarities of any importance ascribed to membership in these groupings are the fabrication of wish fancy.29 Ralph Linton, the anthropologist, neatly put it: "There is no human group whose ancestry is known for even five generations in the exact terms necessary for racial determinations."3" In his zeal to make Christians out of heathens Paul preached that God "made of one blood all the nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth." His real converts at Athens may not have been many; his biology and sociology were good. Race usually cannot be distinguished because of visible, physical signs such as size, shape, or even color. Much less can it be determined by character and intelligence or any of the more esoteric classifications of dissimilarities. Conceivably, fundamental differences may be discovered. Our present scientific tools do not reveal them-even between "Slavic" Russians and "Anglo-Saxon" Americans. One may be able to tell something about a man by his shoes or by his color. One can tell something about his shoes and his color. The French children of the Third Republic, like the German children of the Third Reich, were told that their ancestors "were very tall, their eyes blue, and their hair was blond."'" The only known fact is that no one can know who his ancestors were nor can any group determine them with any exactitude except that they were men and before that . 27 "The evidence . . . demonstrates that every large human group . . . runs very close to the gamut of human capability. . . ."

Shafer Few if any of the so-called racial characteristics tell anything of impor- tance about a man. Men have been encyclopedically catalogued as to hair form and color, skin pigmentation, eye color and shape, stature, head form, size and structure of bones, and the way the head sits on the shoulders. What does this all mean? Simply that in these specific physical ways individual men vary and for this or that group there is a slightly different mean or average or deviation for each of the particular physical parts of the body. To ascribe greater weight to these differences than this would be as wrong as to assert that all men are exactly alike because all their bodily temperatures average around 98.6 degrees. Systematic theories of racial differences are of recent origin,32 dating back for the most part only to the eighteenth century when it was becoming more important to be superior and powerful than to go to Heaven. The theories (they are only that by the grace of inaccurate terminology) have varied widely in time and often with the race or nationality of the investigator. Moreover, racial characters, if they exist, seem to have changed quite unbelievably through the years. Once ("Nordic") England was called "merry" but that was not the England of Attlee and Cripps. Once a Venetian ambassador spoke of the "low morals and excellent cooking" of the English but that was in the sixteenth not the nineteenth century.33 In praising folly, Erasmus spoke of the martial reputation of the ("Mediterranean") Spaniards,3" a characteristic few would accuse them of possessing in our times. Once what we call the northern Europeans ("Nordics?") were supposed to be "full of spirit" but unintelligent (Aristotle) ; the modern version is quite different. None of this proves that theories based upon race are completely untrue. It shows only that there is nothing scientific or God-given about them and that they are for the most part merely a priori guesses of men about other men. The fallacies based upon racial interpretation of human societies may be slowly crumbling. Those pertaining to nationalism still cling as tenaciously as only prejudices can. The human race seems united on a common desire to destroy itself and nationalism happens to be one of the most popular, contemporary methods. 32 Jacques Barzun, Race: A Study in Modern Superstition (New York, 1937), pp. 51-52; Louis L.

Both the unity and the exclusive- ness are founded upon real or imagined differences between national groups. If the people of a group has a common past (and historians may give them one if they do not) of language, race, religion, if it has its own historically claimed rocks and rills and "natural" boundaries, in short, if its members have a common culture and a common geographic location, then its language, race, religion, and rocks and rills are held to be different from, and by a long jump in logic better and more beautiful than, those of other like groups. The well-developed nationalist asserts, "My country, right or wrong," or Deutschland uiber Alles. "A true nationalist," declared the Action Jranfaise, which in the French Third Republic was no minor authority, is one who "places the fatherland above everything."37 What the nationalist does not understand is what Schiller taught: That every "remarkable occurrence" that happens "to men" is of importance to men.38 Denying Bentham's axioms about self-interest seeking the happiness of the greatest number, he believes his own self-interest to lie in development of his own nation's peculiar interests, in its gaining power and prestige at the expense of other like groups.39 Of course, there is no more natural basis for the nationalistic interpretation of man and his relationships than there is for prejudices concerning race. No one can know, as Herder thought he knew,40 that God created different nationalities just as he did different flowers and plants. Every nationality is a mixture of many peoples, races, tribes, families. The modern French are 36 The books on nationalism are many and greatly varying in quality. Among the best in English, French, and German are those by Hauser, Hayes, Johannet, Hertz, Kohn, Meinecke, Mitscherlich, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

Shafer in origin of the Mediterranean, Alpine, Nordic, and a good many other "races." The modern Italians are compounded of Etruscans, Ligurians, Romans, Iberians, Greeks, Gauls, Teutons, and in recent times almost every nationality in Europe and some in Africa. Nor are the Germans, Russians, or Americans any purer. All modern history is a document attesting to national intermixture: migrations, invasions, wars, conquests, marriages. In various degrees every nationality is a conglomeration of the short and tall, the round and the long headed, the dumb and the smart, the virtuous and the sinful. Any one of these characteristics is singular to no nationality, and among all nationalities the characteristics are endlessly duplicated. In fact the attempt to classify nations according to any biological or inherent mental characteristic is only a naive error inherited from early propagandist historians like Tacitus and pseudo-anthropologists like Gobineau. Defoe could have been speaking of any nationality with his Thus from a mixture of all kinds began That heterogeneous thing, an Englishman.4" How little we know about national biological traits becomes clear when we consider that no nationality in Europe or America has individuals so different that they, given the same clothes, cannot easily be taken for members of any of several other nationalities. In Europe, as elsewhere, the so-called national physical characteristics do not correspond with boundary lines, with race, or even clearly with language.42 In fact they exist only as vague and almost meaningless averages for particular physical features. Do Alsatians have French or German bodies? How does the chemical content of the French body differ from that of the German? Can the German spermatozoa impregnate a French egg? Nor is there any such thing as a constant or ever-present national char- acter, unless it is invented by historians.43 The national sentiment, in fact, is of recent origin and the nations themselves are not constant. A modern student of nationality, Bernard Joseph, claims that the Russian is "morose 41 The True-Born Englishman. 42 See, for example, the studies of Stanley Rundle, Language as a Social and Political Factor in Europe (London, 1946); and Geoffrey M.

" Many Russians, especially those at conferences of foreign ministers, are "morose" and one part of Russia is "steppes." Many Italians are "excitable" and certainly the sun shines in Italy. But communists like crocodiles seem to know how to laugh and the sun shines now and then in Russia-especially, for example, in Stalin's Georgia. Leonardo da Vinci and Benedetto Croce, since they were some- times calm and dispassionate, were of course not Italians. Only poetic license or intuition could connect steppes and sun with gloom and passion. Of no nations has more of this kind of nonsense been written than of modern France and Germany. Possibly this is so because of the three wars since 1870 as well as because popular science during this period lent its weight to conflicting national interests. The Germans (including the Rhenish peo- ples?) are supposed to have a disciplined, military character; exactly the opposite of that they were supposed to possess during the early Napoleonic period. The French are thought of today as logical, cultivated (fine), pacifist lovers of freedom; exactly the opposite of what most Europeans considered them during the latter part of the Napoleonic era. What is German char- acter, that of Goethe or Bismarck? What is French cultivation, that of Voltaire or Petain ? This kind of fallacy, of course, grows not only out of bad history. The same error is committed by contemporary two-week tourists and society editors temporarily turned foreign correspondents who set out to confirm all their prejudices and to footnote with their profound platitudes all the horrible peculiarities everyone already, of course, knows about without having investigated. The French, to many contemporary Americans, are a penny- pinching, immoral (not to say licentious) people who have good wine, beautiful, scantily clad women, and a "mess in politics." The Germans to the same Americans are either agreeable, potbellied, kraut-eating, beer- drinking, and music-loving people, or more often during recent war years tall, ramrod-like, blond sadists who cruelly file out the gold fillings of their victims. There are Germans and Frenchmen who fit these stereotypes and Russians and Americans too. But how French logic and cultivation are combined with French licentiousness and "messy" politics is a French national secret and a universal secret as well. A picture of the tall, fierce Prussian soldier eating kraut is somehow unbelievable and did not appear even in Hollywood's colossal dramas or the more realistic shots of the Signal Corps during either Great War. And it happens more kraut is eaten in the 44Bernard Joseph, Nationality: Its Nature and Problems (London, I929), p. 86.</page><page sequence="16">6o8 Boyd C. Shafer United States than in any country while tall, fierce soldiers are highly desired and generally found in the armies of a good many countries. Oliver Goldsmith's comment to a half-dozen patriotic Englishmen of the eighteenth century could be instructive even to modern social scientists." He heard one of them declare "that the Dutch were a parcel of avaricious wretches; that the French a set of flattering sycophants; that the Germans were drunken sots and beastly gluttons; and the Spaniards proud, haughty and surly tyrants: but that, in bravery, generosity, clemency, and in every other virtue, the English excelled all the other world." Goldsmith's reply was, "for my own part, I should not have ventured to talk in such a per- emptory strain, unless I had made the tour of Europe, and examined the manners of these several nations with great care and accuracy: that perhaps, a more impartial judge would not scruple to affirm that the Dutch were more frugal and industrious, the French more temperate and polite, the Germans more hardy and patient of labour and fatigue, and the Spaniards more staid and sedate, than the English; who, though undoubtedly brave and generous, were at the same time rash, headstrong and impetuous . . ." But of course, Goldsmith lived in the eighteenth century which occasionally looked beyond national boundaries at man. And even then Goldsmith was asked why he stayed in England if he didn't like it. The limited view of the nationalist stems from either blindness or vanity, probably both. As David Hume wrote in the eighteenth century, "The vul- gar are apt to carry all national characters to extremes; and having once established it as a principle that any people are knavish, or cowardly, or ignorant, they will admit of no exception, but comprehend every individual under the same censure."4" The faulty reasoning is simple to demonstrate, though its effects are tragic. A group, be it nation- or city-state, cannot be described, though many a wise theorist like Socrates or good modern historian like C. D. Burns has done so, as if it were a single man, an individual with very special qualities.47 Reasoning by analogy is often helpful; it is never accurate. Does Gide, Pissarro, De Gaulle, or a Breton fisherman represent France? Does Mann, Kathe Kollewitz, Streicher, or a Moselle vineyardist stand for Ger- many? Every nationality has many, not just, as it is now popular to say of the Germans, two sides. Every nation has so many sides that it becomes almost impossible to classify any of them as exclusively or even primarily 45 In Frederick Page, ed., An Anthology of Patriotic Prose (London, 1915), pp. 198-201. 46 Hume, Essays and Treatises, 1, 247. 4 Cecil Delisle Burns, poltical Ideals: Ther Nature and Development (London, 1915), pp. 179-83.

Every nation is composed of individuals not stereotypes. When Thomas Mann has his Deutschlin announce, "The Russians have profundity but no form. And in the West they have form but no profundity. Only we Germans have both,"48 one can only hope that the present "Field Marshal of Literature" is himself completely clear on the matter. As with physical traits the mental and spiritual characteristics of the individuals in any one nation overlap those of individuals of other nations. Individuals within nations differ; at the same time they are much like individuals in other nations and the characteristics of any one nation are strangely enough found in individuals of other nations. If there are exclusive national traits, those English, French, and Spanish ones, for instance, so persuasively described by Madariaga, we still know so little about them that we cannot base any intelligent action upon them. "You can always tell an American by his shoes," goes an old tourist axiom. The point that you can't tell anything about the American usually escapes. Languages have most often been thought to denote sharp differences between nations. No one can deny that languages are different, that one or another is better for any one purpose, or that their differences impede inter- national understanding. But the old story about the American pointing at a French menu at five different places and getting pois five times has a point; language may even hide the fact that all men seem to dislike monotony. It is quite possible that the English language is best for novelists and German for scientists. It is also possible that were their languages the same the Russians and Americans might occasionally agree. Yet Fichte's dictum that the elasticity and precision of German made the German superior is precisely as unfounded as Bentham's fancy that English was superior because of its simplicity and force or Dostoevski's insistence that only the Russian could understand all humanity.49 The fact is we don't know and probably can't know. The superstructure of fantastic nonsense built upon the real differences in language might be dismissed by a hearty laugh were not its consequences so dangerous. The well-known English authority on early man, V. Gordon Childe, once pontificated, "The Nordics' superiority in physique fitted them to be vehicles of the superior [the Aryan] language." 5 In this short sentence only five fallacies appear: (i) the Nordics are not superior unless certain 4SThomas Mann, Dr. Faustus (New York, 1948), p. 123. 49Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Addresses to the German Nation, trans.

Shafer quite uncertain, arbitrary criteria are accepted; (2) the Aryan languages may be considered superior only in the same way; (3) a good many non-Nordics use an Aryan language and some Nordics use a non-Aryan language; (4) all languages, including one of the best developed of the Aryan family, the English, have had a tremendous influx of foreign words and phrases, and all languages are built upon older languages which in turn are built upon still others until each has a "medley of origins"; and (5) in many cases, as in France and England, peoples like the Bretons and Alsatians and Welsh and Scots have had national languages forced upon them by conquerors, and now may want to go back to their old languages which they think are superior. This is not all. National languages are of recent origin, dating back at most to late medieval times. They were generally, in western Europe where nationalism first arose, not regarded as the national languages until the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Within any nation the nationals, as for instance the Swiss, may not speak the same language while in other nations people of diverse "races," as the American whites and Negroes, may speak the same language. At the same time nationals of separate nations may speak the same language as do the Spanish and most Latin-American peoples, or the English and the Americans. There is not, then, any exact correlation between language groups and nationalities, and language differences do not clearly divide nationalities.5" No objective criteria are available for the determination of superiority in language. All developed human languages, no matter how widely divergent, seem to be more alike than different, and have much more potential capacity for significant and specific meaning than do the sounds emitted by any other living thing. No matter how beautiful the language of Shakespeare or Goethe or Turgenev, there is no proof that language differences are of great importance except as barriers to understanding. The purely subjective and self-seeking fancies of nationalists like Fichte and Dostoevski are just that, fancies, and they are fancies apparently common to all nationalities. If we know little of significance about physiological, racial, and language differences among nations, this does not prove that all nations are alike. That nations differ in many minor ways takes as much thought as to read "Lil' Abner." They are all and each the result of the myriad, cultural influences that have helped mold them in historical time, especially the last five hundred years of historical time. They differ, too, because their peoples have been 51 In central Europe, Morant points out, there is no relation between physical or racial characteristics and language; and Linton declares that language distributions everywhere "are only superficially related to those of any other elements of culture . . ." (Study of Man, p. 390).</page><page sequence="19">Men Jre More Alike 6II trained and propagandized to feel and believe that they are peculiar, because, by way of illustration, their historians like Treitschke, Michelet, Green, and Bancroft have often provided each of them with a common history, at times quite out of whole cloth. But that they differ here or there does not mean that they are more different than they are alike. The fundamental import of their real historical differences, except that they lead to war, we do not know. And the little we do know points to similarities both as striking and as important. Our little knowledge indeed reveals that nations most often differ precisely because they have conflicting aims for similar ends-prestige, power, and security. Schiller sang, "What is the greatest of nations but a fragment?"-A fragment of humanity, one might add, which the Jew Jesus, the Frenchman Montesquieu, the German Goethe52 held to be above the arbitrary divisions into which petty patriots, narrow scholars, sadistic dictators, cheap journalists, and popular novelists have divided mankind. VII Men are physiologically, racially, nationally at least as much alike as they are different. That is not surprising. Homo sapiens is a species. The individ- uals of the species are not only much alike but so are their problems and their institutions. This is not so strange either. They have inhabited one globe in a comparatively short period of whatever is universal time. They all have had to provide for sustenance and protection against the elements. They have all had to seek the best circumstances for reproduction and the rearing of their children. They all have had a common desire for some kind of creative activity, for a "noble employment of their leisure" if not an "instinct for workmanship." Now they have the common problem of controlling science so that they may survive. As Lawrence K. Frank recently wrote, "all men, everywhere, face the same life tasks, share the same anxieties and perplexities, bereavements and tragedies, seek the same goals in their cultures."53 And what is true now may have always been true. It has been the common error of men not to see this. As men have set about to solve their similar problems, they have naturally evolved similar institutions.54 The family with its ceremony of marriage is 52 For Montesquieu see Albert Sorel, Montesquieu, trans.

Shafer almost universal, though there may be plural husbands or plural wives and some societies are exogamous and some endog,amous, and some are con- jugal and some consanguine. Government, though there may be Aristotle's 158 varieties of constitutions of which some provide justice and others injustice, is common to all. A class system of some kind has evolved in all, even in-Soviet Russia. A church with one or several heads to administer a religion that provides some kind of explanation of the unknown has always grown, though it may be mono- or polytheistic, anthropomorphic or super- natural. Since man in the plural is men and since men inhabit a common Earth, they have met common problems and erected common institutional answers. They are not, whatever they may have thought, so unlike each other, and their cultures have as much in common as in difference. Of the individual differences among men, of their national and racial dissimilarities, the studies are many and some profound. What is chiefly wrong with them is that they are based upon partial observation. They are incomplete because they are so exclusively histories of nations and of national heroes, analyses of national problems, and descriptions of national institu- tions. All that is argued here is that the whole truth be sought, not just the national truth. If men are to survive and the species to flourish the historian must pay at least as much attention to the species as to its varieties. Men are, as Josiah Royce remarked, apparently all a little lower than the angels.55 We can hope that they will remain a bit above other animals only if their experts write histories and make studies that go beyond the national stories and analyses, only if they see Germans, Russians, Chinese, Japanese, English- men, and Americans as part of a common breed called men. It may be that in their search for truth scholars will find differences not now apparent, and that these will lead to the extinction of man. Our present knowledge does not reveal these differences. Scholars who stress them to the exclusion of the known similarities do so at the expense of truth and to their own and mankind's great peril.68 University of Arkansas Culture and Other Essays (Chapel Hill, 1944), p. 92; and G.
