<plain_text><page sequence="1">The New Priorities for Industrial R&amp;D Edward N. Cole New needs of society leading to new demands on business require redirected and expanded R&amp;D efforts. At the same time, researchers must work more closely with government and help establish national priorities in technical areas. American business faces many tough challenges today in moving to respond to the new demands of society. Consumers are highly demanding and value conscious. Cost pressures continue to increase. Competition is tougher than at any time in our history — not only from traditional sources but also from aggressive competitors from overseas. We face an increasing volume of govern ment regulations. And American industry must respond to a much higher level of expectations from the people with respect to social and environ mental goals. Management needs strong support from its research and development team to help meet its responsibilities to the business and society. It is espe cially critical that those responsible for R&amp;D management make maximum use of their capabilities in a complex and changing world. Equally important, they must communicate to top management the full potential of their work so that it can be most effectively utilized in the operation of the business. It Mr. Cole, President of General Motors Corporation, was educated and worked as an engineer before becoming an executive in GM. He is credited with a number of impor tant technical developments in the automotive field. This paper was presented at the Fall Meeting of the I.R.I, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania last October. 12/ January 1972</page><page sequence="2">is vital that you not only increase your productivity but also your skill in merchandising what you are producing. There is another aspect of R&amp;D communications, which also deserves special attention. It is the need to communicate a better understanding of research activities to the general public, to lawmakers and to other key groups which influence national policy affecting our business. We must increase our efforts to provide more and better scientific data so that decisions can be made on a sensible, reasonable basis. We cannot afford major national policies based on no information or bad information, on emotionalism or on political motivations. This has happened too often with government regulations during the past few years. This is not a responsibility to be borne by R&amp;D people alone. You must initiate the research, provide sound facts and make your findings as clear and understandable as possible. But it is up to management - and the resources available to it — to insure that the facts are fed into the nation's decision making machinery and to the general public. This is a job we have not done well in the past, but it is imperative that we begin to do it now. Industrial R&amp;D Role Is Changing I would like to devote a major portion of my paper to a discussion of the changing role of industrial research and development in helping to meet the new challenges of American business. While my comments will concentrate to a large degree on the auto industry, most of them will also have general application to all types of industrial concerns. First, some general observations. It is obvious that an accelerated pace of technological development will be required if business is to meet more de manding consumer needs, to increase its competitive capabilities both here and abroad and to spearhead economic, social and environmental progress for the nation as a whole. Recent cost pressures and inflation have curtailed overall research and development activities. New government regulations — such as those experienced in the automobile industry in safety and emission control — have drawn effort away from some of our traditional programs designed to improve efficiency and productivity. The substantial gains made by foreign manufacturers must be countered more agressively. In my opinion, these and other factors make it imperative that indus trial-type research and development in this country be increased substantially. In addition, increased capital expenditures will be required by American busi ness so that it can take full advantage of technological progress in keeping its facilities and equipment up to date. The big question is how to direct R&amp;D expenditures so that they do the most good — both for our businesses and for the nation. What is the order of January 1972 /13</page><page sequence="3">priorities for research in the years ahead? Obviously, this will vary from company to company, but let me discuss what I believe are some major requirements of industrial R&amp;D in the new business and social environment in which we operate. Traditional Responsibilities Will Continue First, let's look at the traditional responsiblities of industrial R&amp;D. In its simplest terms, this involves new products, product improvements and cost reduction. It is important that this responsibility be maintained as a top priority of R&amp;D — regardless of additional requirements from inside or out side of the business which also must be met. This involves development of new and improved materials and processes, and new labor-saving equipment. We also have extensive programs on the way which will bring wide-ranging changes in the vehicle itself. These will be required to maintain satisfactory overall performance levels and also to meet increasingly stringent requirements of safety and emission controls. As our research and development activities provide us with better, more reliable, more durable, safer and lower-emission products, this will mean even more complex components and systems. One of our major requirements will be to develop new methods and techniques for translating these highly sophis ticated systems into commercial products which are technically feasible, eco nomically reasonable and will perform their functions reliably in the hands of owners. Another important objective of what I consider to be traditional R&amp;D is to stay in the forefront of a much broader sphere of developing technology — scientific knowledge not directly related to the company's current products. No progressive businessman can take the chance that someone in another field might go to bed one night and dream up a way of mixing something in a test tube the next morning which might have revolutionary effects on his business. Any successful company, therefore, must explore every possible area that could affect the success of its particular business. Such basic research is also vital for the continuing development of completely new products or even entirely new industries. This is the type of research which opens new doors of opportunity and can provide dynamic economic stimulus for both individual companies and the nation as a whole. Studies on Long Term Interactions Needed During recent years, the basic responsibilities for industrial R&amp;D have broadened significantly as American business has become increasingly con cerned with the interface of its products with society. For the automobile 14 / January 1972</page><page sequence="4">industry, this involves concern about the effects of its products and plants on the environment, and how to make its products so that they can be operated with greater safety in the hands of owners — as much as possible in spite of driver mistakes or carelessness. It involves concern about the effectiveness of the total transportation system and how our vehicles, present and future, can operate in harmony and efficiency within that system. What management needs from R&amp;D in this important area is not short term fixes to current problems. The pressing need is for broad studies on the long-term interaction of products with society and the environment. We need the same type of intensive, continuing and skillful study in these areas as we devote to the development of ball bearings, brakes and materials. Unfortunately, at the present time, there is a dearth of sound informa tion of this type. Federal regulations in the fiélds of safety and air pollution are being established on the basis of very little scientific information with respect to either the true need for such regulations or the benefits they will achieve in terms of overall objectives. In addition, standards are being estab lished which are far beyond the current state of technology and on time schedules which ignore the lead time required to translate new areas of tech nology into practical and economic realities. Such actions may very well be sending us down the wrong avenues or into blind alleys. This could result in sizable costs for the consumer with relatively small gains in terms of consumer value or environmental improve ment. Needless to say, such actions are creating problems of serious magni tude for the auto industry and other segments of American business. This situation exists today with respect to the federal auto emission requirements for 1975 and 1976 model cars. The same situation existed with the original federal requirements for passive occupant restraints, although these have now been extended from 1974 to 1976 models. This provides a more realistic time schedule for development and installation of this new equipment. I don't want to be unjustly critical of the government officials charged with the responsibility for developing standards in such areas as product safety and the environment. They are under heavy pressure from politicians, well-organized and powerful critics — some of whom are simply against Amer ican business and everything it represents — and they have strong pressures from an aroused and concerned public. They are trying to do the best job they can in meeting the requirements of the law and responding to what they interpret as legitimate public needs. What I am saying is that we have a very urgent need to expand and organize new R&amp;D programs that will provide sound, scientific information in these highly technical fields. The Federal Government also is expanding its research activities in these areas to provide additional technical input. This January 1972 / 15</page><page sequence="5">expanding storehouse of knowledge can provide sound data on which to develop productive and reasonable legislation in fields where it is required. Air Pollution and Safety R&amp;D Let me give you a few examples of this type of long-term, more compre hensive research which will be needed if industrial firms are to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of their products on society in the years ahead. In the field of air pollution, we need in-depth studies of the effects of pollutants on the atmosphere. What actually happens to pollutants once they are released to the atmosphere under a wide variety of conditions? What is the capability of nature to assimilate, eliminate or neutralize these materials? What are the true effects on human and plant life of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen? These three pollutants form the large bulk of auto emissions. However, there is little scientific evidence, which can prove in a definitive manner, the degree of harmful effects caused by these pollu tants. In the field of safety, we need more scientific data on the interaction of driver, environment, road and other factors in creating the conditions for an accident. We have insufficient knowledge about human tolerances of various parts of the body to impact forces. The challenge becomes more complex when you consider such human variations as size, physical and mental health, and whether the driver is using drugs or alcohol. GM and other companies have devoted extensive efforts to research on anthropomorphic dummies. Yet, the dummies available today are woefully inadequate. Substantial further developments will be necessary before we have dummies that can provide us with test results in impacts approaching those of humans in real life accidents. Our General Motors researchers are taking a long-term approach to the overall ground transportation system of this country. The automobile has provided this nation with an unprecedented mobility; it has contributed sig nificantly to the development of our American form of life. But the automo bile also is contributing to some serious problems in our major cities — such as traffic congestion, lack of parking space, air pollution and noise. Minimizing these problems is a major objective in our study of possible future transportation systems. The solution will involve not only technical, but also economic, environmental and social considerations. It may require new and completely different concepts, not only of the overall urban trans portation systems, but also of the types of vehicles - both public and private — which will be required. We believe that the automobile can and must survive in our cities. But it is highly important that the problems created by 16 I January 1972</page><page sequence="6">the automobile be minimized so that it can continue to operate as a useful and necessary part of the urban environment. And we are confident that our researchers can make a major contribution toward this objective. These are only a few examples involving the interrelationship of automo tive vehicles with society, but they indicate the type of new knowledge and facts which must be provided by our research people. Every other industry in America has similar challenges. Research and development has an important responsibility to assist management in making decisions in tune with the changing life styles and in providing not only response to the needs of society but leadership in helping to shape a better future for this nation. Demonstation Must Be Added to R&amp;D Earlier I stressed the importance of industrial R&amp;D communicating the nature and potential of its activities not only to corporate management but, equally important, to lawmakers and the general public. At this particular point in time, those of us with responsibilities for research and overall busi ness management have an even more critical responsibility. We must get across the point that R&amp;D alone is not enough. We must make the public and lawmakers understand that truly valid solutions to technical problems must come from R&amp;D&amp;D — research, development and demonstration. It is amazing how many simple solutions there are to our toughest tech nical problems. On a regular basis, we hear about "revolutionary break throughs" which someone has achieved in a test tube or on a dynamometer. In many cases, these so-called breakthroughs haven't gone through even an adequate research evaluation, let alone development or demonstration. But however they are conceived, these new discoveries are grabbed up by the politicians, by the government and anti-industry critics and given wide visibil ity in the public press. The gasoline spark-ignition engine has been buried many times in the public press. Three or four years ago, it was supposed to be done in by either the electric battery or the fuel cell. Then it was the steam engine that would come like a miracle out of the desert to save us from the conventional internal combustion engine. But despite all of the hoopla and charges of foot-dragging made against the auto industry, at the present stage of technol ogy, there is no radically different alternative power source which can hope to replace the conventional gasoline engine in time to solve our problems in meeting 1975 and 1976 emission control standards and at the same time provide satisfactory transportation. The gas turbine, rotary and stratified charge engines could hold potential for automotive application in the latter part of this decade. However, all three are still in the research stage. Substantial development and demonstration January 1972 /17</page><page sequence="7">activities will be required before these power plants can be considered serious competitors for the conventional internal combustion engine. Research and development people know that it is technically feasible to design one-of-a-kind experimental systems which can produce almost mirac ulous results. We have built such lab-perfect systems meeting the 1975 and 1976 emission standards and so have others. It is quite a different matter to design, build, test, prove, manufacture and sell to the public millions of automobiles each year with a high degree of overall performance, safety, quality and reliability over an extended period of time. In contrast to the idealists, we have to take into consideration such realities as design and manufacturing feasibility, lead time requirements, cost benefit relations and the need for phasing in new developments over a num ber of years. We also have the problem of securing new tools and making sure they operate properly. In addition, we have to train employees to produce these systems at high levels of quality and at desired production rates. These are some of the major disciplines others can ignore but which we in industrial management cannot. They represent to a large degree the differ ence between a lab-perfect design and a satisfactory mass-produced commer cial product. We must continue to emphasize the demonstration portion of our own R&amp;D programs. In addition, we must do everything possible to make the general public understand that the road between paper studies or labora tory concepts to commercial fruition is a long and complex process having few, if any, shortcuts. The Job Ahead for R&amp;D Our society is undergoing significant changes and so is American busi ness. In turn, the functions and responsibilities of industrial R&amp;D must be re-evaluated, expanded and redirected so that they can achieve the greatest long-term gains for the business enterprise and for the nation. It is important to establish new priorities of R&amp;D to meet the new needs of society today and in the future. At the same time, it is critical that we work more closely with the government in helping to establish sound and effective national priorities, particularly in technical areas affecting our business. Sound, well-developed research and development programs are more im portant to the progress of American business and the nation than at any time in our history. They can help us develop new and better products, even whole new industries. They can help us to more effectively meld our products into the basic structures of society in a manner which will stimulate an accelerated rate of technical, economic, environmental and social progress. 18/ January 1972</page></plain_text>
