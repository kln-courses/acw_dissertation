Among the readers of the pornography  magazine I edited, however, were considerable numbers of Tokyo University  students. Among them were Azuma Hiroki and Miyadai Shinji who today  speak eloquently to foreign audiences about Japanese pop culture. As they  and some of their peers have attained high status in the academy and the  world of government officials, the attitude toward otaku in Japanese soci- ety has changed dramatically. We’ve reached the point where officials in the  Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry have taken notice of the foreign  approval of otaku culture, and contemporary artists intent on self-p romotion  have jumped on the wagon, insisting, quite arbitrarily, that otaku and moe are  representative of Japanese pop culture.  Incidentally, some ten years ago, I become involved in the trial of the  sexual perpetrator. While there is absolutely no excuse for his actions, I be- came somewhat angry about how judgment of his crimes kept shifting onto  otaku hobbies or tastes. He was sentenced to death in 2008. His name was  Miyazaki Tsutomu. I think it important to keep in mind both his name and  his interest in Japanese manga and animation.  Speaking before all of you who are interested in Japanese manga and  animation, I feel it important to relate to you, on the one hand, the negative  cultural aspects of otaku and moe in Japan today, and on the other hand, to  speak about the circumstances in Japan whereby the government, the acad- emy, and contemporary artists make use of otaku and moe for the purpose of  self- promotion.  The manga and animation about which I have been speaking so critically is  today being used to promote the nation of Japan, and so I cannot bring myself  to celebrate how these forms of expression have gained in popularity. Because  Japanese manga and animation are being used in this way, I wish to speak in  such a manner as to challenge the situation in contemporary Japan in which  the forgetting of “history” is turning us into a nation of thoroughly trium- phant patriots, but also in a manner easy to understand for foreign audiences. An aesthetic unification of Eisenstein and Disney under conditions of  fascism is the origin of the Japanese manga and animation that everyone  today associates either with Japanese traditions or with postmodernism. I  252 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="5"> should first mention that the two key  sites for my thinking about the unholy  alliance of Disney and the Russian  avant- garde in Japan. The first is the  aesthetics of drawing characters, and  the second is the aesthetics of staging  or presentation.2 Let me first address the problem  of drawing characters. In Japan as in  Western Europe, an avant- garde art  movement arose in the latter part of  the 1920s. As Murayama Tomoyoshi  has indicated, it had a major impact  on the domains of drawing and paint- ing in the form of “constructivism”  (Figure 1). Under the rubric of con- structivism, Murayama includes (a)  Americanism, (b) mechanized forms  of expression intended for the masses,  (c) glorification of the mechanical it- self, and (d) constructivist forms of figure 1. Murayama Tomoyoshi, from Genzai no geijutsu  to mirai ni geijutsu (1924). expression using geometrical designs  and materials. In Figure 2, we see an instance of constructivism as young  Japanese artists understood it at the time. The “construction” of a cargo au- tomobile is rendered through the use of geometric designs such as circles  and straight lines. While such works are clearly borrowed from those drawn  by “original artists” of the Soviet avant- garde, it is very interesting to note  how much simpler in execution was the Japanese understanding of con- structivism at that time. In the early  1920s, as in any other country or pe- riod, such artists were fearless young  men. Figure 3 shows some of the  young men who participated in the  Japanese avant- garde art movement  of the 1920s. Takamizawa Michinao  is among them. They were the first  in modern Japanese art to stage all  manner of “performances”— enacting figure 2. Yanase Masamu, “Kamotsu jidōsha,” from Mizue  strange dances half nude, as in Figure (July 1925). an  unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 253 </page> <page sequence="6"> 3, or wandering around the city with draw- ings in a cart and calling it an “art exhibi- tion” or throwing stones at authorized art  exhibitions and running off.  In the 1930s, however, Stalin began to  criticize constructivist artists in the Soviet  Union. Under the influence of Soviet so- cialism, many of the avant- grade artists in  Taishō Japan shifted their emphasis from  constructivism to social realism. One of the  young men among them, Takakimi Michi- nao, suddenly changed his name to Tagawa  Suiho and started to produce works like the  one shown in Figure 4— the character Nor- akuro. Takakimi transformed himself into  manga artist Tagawa Suiho in 1931, the first  year of the Fifteen Year Asia- Pacific War.  figure 3. “Odori” featuring Iwanofu Sumiyabitchi, That Norakuro was born in the first year of  Okada Tatsuo, and Takamizawa Michinao, from the Fifteen Year War is highly emblematic  1920 nendai Nihon exhibition catalogue (1988). of the times. Such was the fate of Japanese  manga and animation as media produced  under conditions of war. Within Japanese art history, Tagawa is  considered a traitor, for he abandoned the  avant- garde art movements of the mid-  1920s and shifted his allegiance to manga,  a mass- oriented form of expression. Yet did  Tagawa truly abandon avant- garde art? He  did not. Rather he created a ground for mod- ern manga expression by taking up Disney  within the framework of constructivism.  Let’s look closer at this process. Figure 5  presents a rabbit from Chōjū jimbutsu giga  (a twelfth- century picture scroll of “animal  person caricatures”), which is often taken as  figure 4. Tagawa Suiho, Norakuro jōtōhei (1931). the origin for Japanese manga. If you men- tally contrast this rabbit with Mickey Mouse (which we are unable to repro- duce due to copyright), however, you’ll surely see that the character Norakuro  bears greater resemblance to Mickey Mouse.  254 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="7"> In fact, in the 1930s, beginning  with Mickey Mouse, massive amounts  of American animation poured into  Japan. As a result, within a very short  period of time, Japanese manga was  full of characters modeled on Mickey  Mouse and Felix the Cat (Figure 6).  And the 1930s saw a dramatic increase  in the numbers of manga aimed at  children. Suddenly pirate editions of  Mickey Mouse were being published.  Figure 7 is excerpted from a work  called Mickey Mouse Chūsuke, which  opens with a Japanese mouse who, figure 5. Detail from Chōjū jimbutsu giga emaki (twelfth  century). jealous of Mickey Mouse’s popularity,  makes himself a costume to become Mickey. Pirate editions of Mickey stories  were also produced. Figure 8 shows a work called Shiro chibi suihei (Little white  sailor). The little white sailor is a white bear, who then is soaked in octopus ink  (Figure 9). Here, too, it is abundantly clear that he is Mickey Mouse.  The manga artists who appeared on the scene in the 1930s were conscious  of the fact that they were pirating Mickey and company. Tagawa Suiho cre- ated Norakuro by adopting the techniques for drawing characters in Disney  and Hollywood animations. Particularly important was the adoption of the  “drawing techniques” for characters established in the American animation  industry in the 1920s. Of particular interest are instances like that in Figure  10, where works associated with Tagawa’s avant-g arde circles— that is, “con- structivism”— are cited in the middle of Norakuro.  figure 6. The four characters are the stray black dog from Tagawa Suiho’s “Norakuro series” (1931–39); the  mouse from Shimada Keizō’s Bōken Dankichi series (1934–1938); the white bear by Ōshiro Noboru’s Shirochibi  suihei (1933), and the cat from Shimada Keiji’s Nekoshichi-sensei (1940). an  unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 255 </page> <page sequence="8"> figure 7.

Tagawa Suihō, “Mōken guntai no Norakuro ittōhei,” from  Shōnen kurabu, April 1932. 256 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="9"> Above all, Tagawa used the  Americanism of Disney characters as  a form of expression targeted toward  the masses within the print medium  of manga. As a manga artist, Tagawa  had already addressed the topic of  “machines” in his very first work,  Jinzō ningen or “Artificial Human”  (Figure 11). The artificial human was  a notion borrowed from such works  as Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and Karel  Čapek’s RUR. The robot was an em- blematic motif in the Japanese avant-  garde movement.  Similarly, Tagawa understood  Disney’s characters above all as “con- structions.” It was the same for other  manga artists. The young men who  experienced the avant- garde move- ment in Japan understood Mickey  Mouse as a form of “drawing based  on geometrical construction.” Figure  figure 11. Tagawa Suihō, “Jinzō ningen,” from Fuji, April 1929. 12 shows a guide for drawing Mickey  by animator Ōfuji Noburō. Mickey is clearly understood as a “construction”  based on “circles.” Thus these men approached the “form” of that representa- tive character of Hollywood animation, Mickey, within the conceptual frame- work of “construction.” As it became Disneyified, manga expression in 1930s  Japan constituted a radical break with prior traditional modes of expression.  The emphasis on Chōjū jimbutsu giga as the origin of manga expression  begins in 1924 with Hosokibara Seiki’s general history of manga, Nihon manga-  shi (History of Japanese manga) (Figure 13). In the Edo period, the style of  twelfth- century picture scroll Chōjū jimbutsu giga became known as “Toba-e ”  or “Toba- style drawing,” which Kuwagata Keisai made into a highly conven- tionalized “sketching style.” Kuwagata’s manga were a prolongation of this  “sketching style,” which tradition persisted until the mid- 1920s, that is, well  into the Taishō era. Hosokibara’s book was published just after the rise of  what I am calling Disneyification. Even today, however, because histories of  Japanese manga still refer to his book, they continue to present Chōjū jimbutsu  giga as the origin of manga. That tradition came to an end with the advent of  an unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 257 </page> <page sequence="10"> avant- garde artists, however, and the history of Japanese manga begins in  fact with the Disneyification of Japanese manga.  At the risk of getting ahead of myself, a quick comparison of Mickey with  the characters of Tezuka Osamu, the pioneer of postwar Japanese manga,  makes this Disneyification very clear (Figure 14). Tezuka’s style of drawing  characters shows him to be a direct heir to the Disney style of manga and  animation established during the Fifteen Year Asia- Pacific War.  figure 12.

All rights reserved. 258 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="11"> To return to my discussion, manga expression for Tagawa Suiho was in- deed an extension of Taishō avant-g arde expression. Yet because he was not  much of a theorist, he didn’t write much about his work. He has thus come to  be seen as someone who abandoned the avant-g arde art movement. If con- temporary artists in Japan today feel uncomfortable about designating manga  as art, it is because they remain ignorant of this history of manga expression  as a direct heir to the avant-g arde movement. What is more, it so happened  that conventions for making such art in Japan came of an initial unification  of Disney with the avant- garde art movement.  I would now like to discuss how the conventions for staging or presenta- tion in manga and animation came about through a unification of Disney  and Eisenstein. Let me begin with a look at traditional forms of Japanese art. Figure 15 shows a scene from a twelfth-c entury picture scroll called Banno  dainagon ekotoba. Such scenes were drawn and painted onto long scrolls to  create a story. If we take seriously the claim of Studio Ghibli’s Takahata Isao  that the scenes of picture scrolls are like the panels of manga, we would come  up with something like Figure 16. Takahata feels that techniques of staging in  manga and animation are close to those of Japanese picture scrolls, and so, to  make his argument clear, he transformed the picture- scroll presentation into  a manga presentation.3 Similarly, Figure 17 shows a scene from a picture scroll  produced in the late twelfth century, Shigisan- engi. And in Figure 18, we see  how my college students transposed it in the same manner as Takahata. These  students, who are studying manga expression, were able, just like Takahata,  to transpose the picture scroll into a manga panel layout. I did not offer them  any concrete explanation of how Takahata had actually transposed a picture  scroll into manga form. Yet they produced such a transposition without any  particular trouble. As we see in Figure 19, Japanese picture scrolls have a “base line” running  through the middle of picture to provide a point of reference for viewing, al- lowing the viewer’s eyes to shift back and forth from upper to lower halves,  or to pause in places. It is, in fact, possible to transpose such a movement of  the viewing position into the form of manga panels.  My discussion thus far will probably lead you to conclude that traditional  arts are indeed the origin for Japanese manga and animation. Yet it is due to  a completely new sensibility established during the Fifteen Year War that we  are today able to look at traditional arts in light of developments in manga  panel layout. Both Takahata and my students are faithful heirs to it. This very  conceptual matrix was brought about through an Eisensteinification of manga  and animation expression.  an unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 259 </page> <page sequence="12"> figure 15.

Figure 20 shows but one of many of Japanese translations of Eisenstein  and Soviet film theory. The General Line (aka Old and New, 1929, dir. Sergei  Eisenstein) was released in Japan in 1931, but Eisenstein’s other films were  not released until after World War II. In contrast, his montage theory was  widely translated and introduced. The  following episode gives a better sense  of the extent to which montage theory  spread to the general public:  In Kinugasa Teinosuke’s Reimei  izen appears a title about consumer  culture of the Edo period, and the  film cuts between the courtesan en  route, the lord’s procession, and the  temple ceremony. Someone in the  audience called out, “Montage, that’s  montage,” and signs of respect ran  through everyone in the theater.4  Such a reaction on the part of mass  film spectators indicates that montage  theory was widely known. Actually,  with the exception of Kinugawa Teino- suke, there were hardly any film people  who learned film theory directly from  figure 20.

They looked for Eisenstein- style mon- tage in European films or, after a certain time, in those of Leni Riefenstahl.  In other words, from the 1930s, both Eisenstein’s film theory and Mickey  animations were widely distributed in Japan, simultaneously.  Montage theory became widespread because young men saw it as a form  of avant- garde theory, but there was also another reason. Eisenstein sought  out montage within Japanese culture itself. For Eisenstein, all Japanese cul- ture was montage. For instance, he wrote: Another remarkable characteristic of the Kabuki theater is the principle of  “disintegrated” acting. [. . .] [The actor] performed his role in pieces of acting  262 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="15"> completely detached from each other: Acting with only the right arm. Act- ing with one leg. Acting with the neck and head only.5  So it is that Eisenstein saw “montage” in the disintegrating acting of the  kabuki actor. Chinese characters were also instances of montage for him: The point is that the copulation (perhaps we had better say, the combina- tion) of two hieroglyphs of the simplest series is to be regarded not as their  sum, but as their product [. . .] For example: the picture for water and the  picture of an eye signifies “to weep”; the picture of an ear near the drawing  of a door = “to listen” . . .6 In Figure 21 appears the character that Eisenstein used in his explana- tion of montage. On the left side is what is called the “radical” for “water.” On  the right side is the character for “eye,” which was  originally a pictogram. A “montage” of the two  characters results in the new character shown in both Eisenstein’s film  Figure 21, which is read rui or namida in Japanese, theory and Mickey  that is, “tears” or “to weep.” animations were widely  And in Figure 22 we see the practical diagrams distributed in Japan,  Eisenstein used to demonstrate montage within simultaneously. Japanese painting. In other words, he insists that  the Japanese method consists in using so-c alled cuts within a painting. Eisen- stein tells us that the Japanese approach a single painting as constructed of  parts, that is, as montage.  The Russian avant- garde in which Eisenstein took part also looked for  “constructions” in the circus and other popular arts. For them, “construc- tions” became visible through forms of expression modeled on “primitive”  culture or popular culture. Japanese culture was not especially singled out  as the only instance of montage, and yet Eisenstein’s account of montage in  Japanese culture had a great impact in Japan. As a result, the Japanese of that  era began to seize on just about anything as an instance of montage. Figure  23, for instance, shows graphic montage that combines photography and mon- tage in a manner inspired by Soviet propaganda media. From a contemporary  perspective, this looks rather like manga panels. Such a technique of treating  a series of photographs as cuts within the image and conceptualizing a layout  looks just like the method of presentation in contemporary manga. Such an  example allows us to look at manga panels anew: both in terms of temporal  order and spatial structure within the book, they now appear as montage.7  an unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 263 </page> <page sequence="16"> figure 21.

It was Okudaira Hideo who strongly pro- up writing scripts  moted a montage theory of picture scrolls. But it was  for culture films. Imamura Taihei who subsequently gave it new life by  extending it to animation. Imamura even insisted that  the Japanese myths in the Kojiki were written in accordance with techniques  of montage. Drawing on Eisenstein, Imamura and others insisted that picture  scrolls had been constructed in accordance with cinematic techniques such as  close- up shots and montage. In this way, the point of view allowing for the  transposition of picture scrolls into manga panels took shape in 1930s Japan.  In this context, then, we must touch on the career of Imamura. Imamura  wrote the first critiques of animation in Japan as well as critiques of docu- mentary film. After the war, his criticism had a major impact on Takahata Isao  of Studio Ghibli. Studio Ghibli recently republished Imamura’s book, with a  commentary by Takahata Isao.8 Imamura’s work is typical of film criticism  of his era. Which is to say, he immersed himself in Marxism and avant- garde  film theory, only to drop Marxism and readily “convert” to nationalism. After  Imamura was arrested, he converted. After his release, another form became  prevalent in Japan, after the Manchurian Incident of 1931—b unka eiga or  “culture film,” which comprised newsreels and educational films. In Japan of  the 1930s and 1940s, documentary films were called “culture films” and were  promoted as a part of national policy. In sum, there were two developments. On the one hand, avant- garde  artists absorbed Disney- style manga and animation, and on the other hand,  in the wake of the conversion of young filmmakers, the culture film became  widely accepted. Filmmakers began shooting documentary films to be used  for national propaganda. Indeed, to their chagrin, poets of Marxist persua- sion ended up writing scripts for culture films. Among the works of the poet  Nakano Shigeharu after his conversion is “Kūsōka to shinario” (1939, The  dreamer and the script). The story is that this left-w ing poet, starved for work,  was asked to write the script for a culture film. In fact, Oguma Hideo, who  spoke critically of Nakano’s conversion, wrote culture film–style manga con- veying scientific pedagogy for children. Within literary history, Oguma is said  to be a poet who stuck to his political convictions, but from the standpoint of  manga history, he looks in fact like a creator of regulations for manga expres- sion in line with the Ministry of the Internal Affairs.  Thus 1930s Japan saw the emergence of national policy for film and other  forms of expression, that is, national propaganda.

In Ger- many, when Joseph Goebbels put pressure on  Lang to produce films for Hitler, he presented Eisenstein as a fine example.  It is undeniable that Eisenstein’s techniques and aesthetics were brilliant as  tools for propaganda.  In 1930s Japan, a large number of popular dramatic films were made with  military motifs, but not due to governmental pressure; audiences clamored  for them, and so the studios went on making them. Non-e ntertainment docu- mentary films, however, were made under government leadership. The idea  that documentary film was a newer art and a loftier one entered the world of  Japanese cinema centered on young men who had converted from Marxism.  Japan, inspired by Germany, established a Film Law in 1939. Those involved  in filmmaking welcomed it, taking it as government recognition of cinema.  This Film Law practically mandated screenings of culture films. As for Imamura, he readily abandoned Marxism but had no intention of  abandoning Disney and film theory. Imamura does not give the impression  of being a fascist, or a Marxist, or even a patriot. His love was for Disney and  film theory. Just before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Imamura published a  book called Manga eiga ron (A theory of cartoon film). It was a theory of Dis- ney, with the character Mickey drawn on the title page (Figure 24). This book  remained in print throughout the war. With the outbreak of the war with the  United States, American films, American culture, and English were outlawed  in Japan. Yet Imamura continued to write about Disney.  This may explain why the Naval Department ordered the production of  animated films in the Disney style. Statements by Imamura like the following  may indeed have had an effect: The prior superiority of Disney cartoons as art lay in their superiority as  weapons for propaganda warfare. In them we can see how fine art may play  a powerful role in enlightening the public. If we are unable to produce car- toons like those of Disney, we will be overpowered.9  Imamura threatens the military, saying that, if Japan does not have anima- tion on par with Disney, colonial rule and propaganda will fail. He even refers  to animation as a “weapon.” And so the Naval Department, which was far  weaker in propaganda than the Army, decided to support animation. Japan  266 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="19"> figure 24. Imamura Taihei, Manga eiga ron (Daiichi bungeisha, 1941). by that time was already supporting the special domain of culture films by  government fiat. The Navy lent its support to the production of animation as  “culture film,” that is, as documentary- style propaganda film. This is how it  became possible to produce animation using Disney techniques in accordance  with Eisenstein’s theory.  Let’s look at attitudes toward Disney in other countries during World War  II. There is some evidence that, even though Disney animation was banned  in Germany, Goebbels secretly imported Disney animation to watch. In the  Soviet Union, Stalin ordered copying the Disney system of cooperative pro- duction, which imitated agricultural cooperatives. Yet these men did not in- troduce Disney aesthetics into their national animation.  Japan, however, strived to produce Disney- style animation with  Eisenstein- style aesthetics. (As I mentioned previously, because Eisenstein’s  films were not shown in Japan, the point of reference by default was Lang,  whose films anticipated in Nazi Germany the role of Eisenstein, as well as  Leni Riefenstahl, who took on the position offered to Lang, directing such  films as Olympia and Triumph of the Will.) Thus a feature- length animated film,  Momotarō: Umi no shinpei (1945, Momotaro: Divine warriors of the sea), was  produced under the direction of the Naval Department. an unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 267 </page> <page sequence="20"> This film recreated in animation the invasion of Dutch- controlled Indo- nesia by Navy paratroopers in 1942. It might be called a documentary film in  animation. It follows the process of the operation for invasion, rather than  telling a story. The military operations of these paratroopers also provided  material for propaganda art centered on the war, called “war pictures.” Let us  look more closely at the aesthetic features of Momotarō: Umi no shinpei.  First, there is the coexistence of Disney characters and realism. Char- acters are drawn as anthropomorphic animals in the Disney manner, while  weaponry such as military machinery is drawn realistically (Figure 26) in con- trast to the caricaturized “weaponry” found in Disney. Such a coexistence of  animation- style characters and realistic weaponry is a characteristic feature  of Japanese animation such as Gainax’s Neon Genesis Evangelion. I have no  particular objection to the coexistence of realistically drawn weaponry with  nonrealistic animation characters but simply wish to call attention to this  aesthetic lineage.  figure 25. Screengrab  from Seo Mitsuyo’s  Momotarō: Umi no   shinpei (1945). Second, there is the aesthetics of cinematic composition. From cut to  cut, elements related to the camera lens— camera position and camera angle  as well as depth and shading— are clearly distinguished. Low angle shots of  characters are a prime example. Shooting anonymous soldiers and persons  from an extremely low angle is a technique common in Eisenstein’s films,  Rodchenko’s photos, and Riefenstahl’s films (Figure 27). A large number of  high angle shots is equally common. Composition with high angles was so  commonplace that Mishima Yukio, who saw Riefenstahl’s Olympia as a boy  during the war, made mention of its aesthetics of high angles. The overall  composition of screen space is dominated by sharp angles (Figure 28). In  268 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="21"> figure 26. Screengrab from Seo Mitsuyo’s Momotarō: Umi no shinpei (1945). addition, in Eisenstein’s films, objects in the foreground appear blurred, out  of focus, which induces an awareness of the camera’s presence (Figure 29). This  imparts a sense of layers to the image. Compositions consisting of characters  and background painted on separate layers were used frequently in Taiyō no  ōji Horusu (1968, Little Norse Prince), directed by Takahata Isao, which may be  considered the basis for the aesthetics of Studio Ghibli (Figure 31).  Sometimes this manner of organizing screen space is taken as a charac- teristic feature of Japanese animation. The Wachowski Brothers’ Speed Racer  (2008) is a live- action remake of Tastunoko Production’s Mahha GOGOGO  (1967–68, Speed Racer) using CGI, and in many scenes, they deliberately em- ploy film techniques that separate the background into layers, surely because  they take such Eisenstein- style techniques in Japanese anime to be charac- teristic features of Japanese animation.  Also in relation to cinematic composition, we see in Momotarō: Umi no  shinpei the use of camera work rather than movement as well as compositions  with strong backlighting (Figure 32). Here we see the influence of impression- ism and Eisenstein.  an unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 269 </page> <page sequence="22"> figure 27.

Exactly the same techniques of editing are used in “culture films”  and documentary film to connect cuts into an image sequence. All Japanese  culture became montage to the point where “Japanese” and montage became  the same thing. I should mention in passing that the scene depicting the “la- bor” of the “collective” in Momotarō: Umi no shinpei is similar to Eisenstein  and Riefenstahl. Miyazaki Hayao is heir to this aesthetics of collective labor. In sum, in its cinematic composition, camera work, and editing, Momotarō:  Umi no shinpei shows affinity with the documentary style of culture films.  The first feature- length animation in Japan was a “culture film” made in ac- cordance with Eisenstein’s film principles using Disneyified characters and  animation techniques.  The film was completed in the spring of 1945. Japan soon lost control of  Japanese airspace, and Tokyo and Osaka were subject to repeated aerial bom- bardments. Amid the ruins of the devastated city of Osaka, a boy went to see  Momotarō: Umi no shinpei. This is what he wrote in his journal: My first impression of the film was that it seemed to use elements of culture  films, and even though called a war film, it had in fact taken on a peaceful  form. [ . . .] My next impression was that cartoons had been very beautifully cine- matized. As in photography and film, things were depicted from every angle.  The scene in which the monkey and dog leap into the river gorge looks so  real. What is more, the storyline was clearer than anything before it; it was  more like a documentary than a cartoon.10 The fifteen- year-o ld boy clearly indicates that, while this film was anima- tion, it was a “culture film,” shot through with documentary techniques and  aesthetics. That boy was Tezuka Osamu, the very mangaka who is considered  the origin of “postwar” Japanese manga.  Immediately after he saw Momotarō: Umi no shinpei, he drew a manga  called Shōri no hi made (Until the day of victory) in his notebook to show  to his friends. In a recently discovered incomplete draft of Shōri no hi made,  the influence of Momotarō: Umi no shinpei is evident in the style of cuts. Like  Momotarō: Umi no shinpei, Shōri no hi made is without story. It is a propaganda  manga, that is, a culture film–style manga, about the people’s air defense sys- tem. Insofar as all of Tezuka’s other works from the same time have stories,  the absence of a story makes clear that he had Momotarō: Umi no shinpei in  mind. American animation characters play American soldiers, and Japanese  272 ōtsuka eij i </page> <page sequence="25"> manga characters play Japanese roles. As is well known, Disney made propa- ganda animation, and Tezuka evidently understood such techniques of pro- paganda animation in “mobilizing” manga and anime characters. Note that  animation- style characters coexist with realistic weaponry, and composition  and camera angles are quite diverse (Figure 34). It would seem that, after see- ing Momotarō: Umi no shinpei, Tezuka translated in manga the techniques of  Disney- style cartoon characters and Eisenstein- style animation.  As mentioned previously, Tezuka experienced the Osaka air raids. In the  air raids, strafing by the American military killed noncombatant civilians.  Tezuka experienced all of this as a child. We see the effects of such experiences  in the climactic scene of Shōri no hi made (Figure 35). Mickey, piloting a realisti- cally drawn warplane, is firing on a youth resembling Tezuka (depicted with  Mickey- style antirealist drawing techniques). The boy is struck in the chest,  and blood gushes forth. The sequence of panels includes a series of differ- ent angles and short cuts. Historically speaking, such a sequence succeeds in  bringing into manga expression the “unholy alliance of Disney and Eisenstein”  that had been achieved in animation. The myth that cinematic techniques first  appeared in Shin Takarajima, created by Tezuka with Sakai Shichima, is truly  a thing of the past, but it is true that Tezuka brought “cinematic techniques”  figure 33.

The cinematic techniques, however, were those of war- time animation expression, and it happened in Shōri no hi made not Shin  Takarajima.  In Shōri no hi made, Tezuka made another important contribution to  manga expression, the “mortal body” or the “flesh-a nd-b lood body.” 11 Tezuka  uses Disney- style drawing techniques to depict the youth who resembles  him,12 yet he endows his stand- in with a flesh-a nd-b lood body: when Mickey  shoots the youth, he starts to bleed. Disney-s tyle iconography and Eisenstein-  style realism are combined in this character’s body, making for a new set of  conventions. In imparting a flesh- and-b lood body to a character deriving from  the Disney style, Tezuka determines the nature of postwar manga.13 It was  then possible to stage situations for Japanese manga and animation char- acters that presuppose a body at once vital and mortal, capable of violence  and sexuality. Contemporary forms of manga expression portraying sexual  behavior of “nonexistent youth” are a result of such a development.14  By way of conclusion, I would like to give one example from Tezuka where  the influence of Eisenstein is very clear. In later years, Tezuka wrote about his  drawings as follows: Well, actually, I think of them rather like hieroglyphs. In my drawings, when  someone’s surprised, the eyes get round, and when someone’s angry, like  Hige- Oyaji- san, creases always appear around the eyes, and the face jumps  about. There are these patterns, you see. Each is a sort of sign or icon [kigo].  When you bring together this pattern and that pattern and yet another pat- tern, there appears a sort of picture where it all holds together. There are hun- dreds of them running through my head, these patterns for combinations.  But it isn’t like fine art, I think of each one as a highly schematic sign.15  In manga studies today, there is a good deal of serious analysis of what  Tezuka calls kigo, that is, “signs” or “icons,” yet there is almost no interest  in how Tezuka picks up on Eisenstein’s montage theory of Japanese culture  in explaining his drawing. Yet Tezuka may be understood as the historical  inheritor of the unholy alliance of Disney and Eisenstein in that he evokes  Eisenstein’s montage theory in the context of his drawings based on Disney,  which allows him to discuss them as “constructions.”  Tezuka was from probably the last generation to be touched by wartime  film theory. He developed techniques for “cinematic manga” in the postwar  period on the basis of practical applications of theory. Indeed Tezuka worked  an unholy alliance of  eisenstein  and disney 275 </page> <page sequence="28"> it is neither Japanese  out exceedingly diverse forms of postwar manga ex- traditions nor  pression on the basis of wartime film theory.  postmodernism that  Within animation history, there is also an ob- we must see in  vious connection between prewar film theory and  Japanese manga and  Ghibli.

This hap- pened under conditions that can only be described in terms of an unholy  alliance of Disney and Eisenstein under conditions of fascism. That wartime  aesthetics extends into contemporary manga and anime aesthetics. The cre- ative style of contemporary Japanese manga and animation has changed con- siderably from Disney, but Mickey and Minnie are still there at the base, and  techniques of staging or presentation are in the lineage of Eisenstein.  As such, it is neither Japanese traditions nor postmodernism that we  must see in Japanese manga and animation, but rather the genesis of an aes- thetics formed under fascism. Animators and animation theorists linked Dis- ney and Eisenstein within a fascist system, arriving at a unified aesthetic. It is  precisely this development that explains the international quality of Japanese  manga and animation. A form of expression combining Disney and Eisenstein  cannot but reach throughout the world.  Japanese have forgotten this history, however, and those outside Japan  look for traditionalism or postmodernism in otaku culture, and none of them  strive to see the true history of Japanese manga and animation. I leave to you  the historical judgment of whether such a history of Japanese manga and  animation should be appraised in terms of a miraculous encounter of Eisen- stein and Disney or should be criticized as being after all nothing but a close  relative of Leni Riefenstahl.
