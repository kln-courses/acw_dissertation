LOWELL Los Nogales 700, Dept. 902 Santiago, Chile R.R. 3, Box 197 Nogales, AZ 85621 ABSTRACT Among the typical artifacts of the Hohokam culture of southern Arizona during the period from A.D. 500 to A.D. 1150 are rectangular, stone "paint palettes." The function of these objects has always been uncertain, but comparison on the basis of size, form, decoration, materials, and provenience with the snuff trays, or tabletas de rape of South America strongly suggests that Hohokam paint palettes were associated with the use of hallucinogenic plant materials. Also significant to the problem is the close coincidence in time between the use of palettes by the Hohokam and prehistoric use of tabletas in Chile, Colombia, and probably in Guerrero, Mexico. Other Hohokam artifacts such as bone tubes, ef- figy vessels, and mortars and pestles also resemble utensils of the inhalatory complex found in archaeological sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Antilles, and South America. Use of these utensils in inhaling hallucinogenic snuff is re- ported in historic times in the Antilles and South America and continues to the present in areas of the Amazon Basin and northwestern Argentina. Widespread magico-religious use of narcotic plants by peoples of the New World is well known. Hallucinogenic red mescal beans found in rock shelters in northern Mexico and Texas date from the ninth millenium B.C. (Schultes and Hof- man 1980:157). Some narcotic plants used in the Americas, such as a species of jimsonweed (Datura) and a species of tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, are cultigens unknown in the wild, indicating long cultivation by man (Schultes and Hofman 1980:21). The importance of hallucinogenic experience in religion, divination, and curing in New World cultures led to the use of more different species of hal- lucinogens than have been used in the Old World (Schultes and Hofman 1980:22). A great variety of methods were used to ingest narcotic plant materials with an ac- companying variety of specialized utensils for preparation, storing, and adminis- tering these materials. The snuffing of hallucinogens is "peculiarly New World" (Schultes 1967:291). Peoples of many different language and cultural groups have used var- ious types of receptacles and inhaling tubes in snuffing powdered plant materials. The center of use of hallucinogenic snuff is thought to be in the area of the north- ern Amazon Basin (Torres 1987:11). Snuff is still used in this area and in some other isolated areas of the Amazon Basin and northwestern South America (Wassen 1967:271; Torres 1987:56).

In western South America, utensils for snuffing are found in archaeological sites as far south as Coquimbo in Chile (Torres 1984:25). The snuffing of hallucinogens in the Caribbean area at the time of Spanish conquest is established by archaeological evidence and by historical reports by explorers and chroniclers (Wassen 1967:233-237). Prehistoric ceramic, bowl-</page><page sequence="3">Paletas and Tabletas 323 type snuffers, a device consisting of a container with projecting tube or tubes for inhaling, probably indicate the use of hallucinogenic snuff in Precolumbian times in Costa Rica in Central America. Artifacts recovered from sites in Nayarit and Guerrero that date from about 1000 B.C. to A.D. 200 appear to indicate snuffing of hallucinogens in western Mexico (Figures 1 and 2; Furst 1974:10, Plates 1-3). This study suggests that Hohokam stone palettes were used as trays associated with snuff ceremonialism and is based on the analysis of museum collections in Arizona and Chile and on library research. Stone palettes are a distinctive artifact of the prehistoric Hohokam people of the Gila and Salt river valleys in Arizona. Parallels can be seen between the Hohokam stone tablets and snuff trays from South America, particularly the tabletas de rapd from the San Pedro de Atacama area in northern Chile (Figures 3-5). Analogies are found among attributes such as size, form, decoration techniques, and materials. Other parallels are found in provenience, in types of associated utensils, and in coincidence in time.

SNUFFING AND SNUFF UTENSILS A wide variety of paraphernalia has been used for snuff taking in South America. A leaf or the palm of the hand, tabletops, and sea shells as well as elabo- rately carved trays and tubes have been used to hold snuff prior to inhaling. In addition, a typical assemblage of utensils known as the "inhalatory complex" (Berenguer 1984:14) was widely used. This assemblage includes a pouch that contains the tray, inhaling tube, and all or some of the following: a small mortar, pestle, spatula or spoon, and storage receptacles for the hallucinogenic snuff (Torres 1987:3, Figures 4 through 8). Implements of long thorns or feathers used for cleaning the inhaling tubes are sometimes found with tubes and trays (Wassen 1965:55, 1967:262). Bags are not always present or preserved. Among the addi- tional paraphernalia found in the Amazon area are brushes made of the tail hairs of the ant bear to spread the snuff powder (Wassen 1965:58, 94). A larger mortar is used for pulverizing coarse plant materials (Schultes 1979:Figure 23). At the pre- sent time bark exudate is often cooked in a metal pan (Schultes 1979: Figure 18). The fact that present-day inhabitants of the Amazon Basin use snuff tablets "mor- phologically and iconographically similar" (Torres 1986:49) to the snuff trays widely found in archaeological sites in Andean areas has established the use of the trays and associated utensils in inhaling hallucinogenic snuff powder. Ceremonial use of Precolumbian trays also included kindling fire. Holes made by a fire drill have been recognized on 21 trays from burials at San Pedro de Atacama, with as many as four holes on some examples (Torres 1987:Plates 85, 119, 135).

Also, other fire-making implements were found in association with snuff trays in 11 burials at San Pedro de Atacama (Torres 1987:92). Historic accounts and early ethnographic reports from the Antilles and South America described the use of hallucinogenic snuff in curing and divination as well as to improve vision and alertness (Wass6n 1965:96-97, 104, 105). Despite these reports, speculation as to the use of the trays continued, including the suggestion by Lehmann-Nitsche in 1902 that the trays had been used as paint palettes (Torres 1987:8). In 1910 Max Uhle argued for the use of the trays in inhaling snuff (1912:533), which has since been confirmed by additional archaeological evidence. Inhaling tubes are most commonly carved of wood, but tubes of bone (Figure 6c, d, e) or canes also were used. The earliest known tubes, reported by Bird (1948) from Huaca Prieta, Peru, are of bird and fox bone. A double tube of monkey arm bones was collected in Brazil (Wassen 1965:Figure 17). Single, double, Y-shaped, and large tubes several feet long, which are used when one person in- hales and another blows (Seitz 1967: Figure 12) are used. Tubes are generally</page><page sequence="7">Paletas and Tabletas 327 a b o 2 cm Figure 7. a and b.

The diameter is usually small, around 1 cm. Single tubes often consist of two pieces, the nosepiece, which fits the nostril, and the slimmer shaft that tapers to the end placed against the receptacle holding the powders. Skill and artistry in wood carving created "an art to appreciate from a close view," according to Berenguer (1984:19). Some elaborate design elements cover no more than one square centimeter (Berenguer 1984:19). Mortars found with the tabletas are often as small as 4 cm high and only 1.5</page><page sequence="8">328 LOWELL cm C Figure 8. a-c. Stone mortars and "plummet-shaped pestles" from San Pedro de Atacama (courtesy Museo del Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas Gustavo LePaige S.J. de la Universidad del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama). cm to 2 cm in diameter. These very small mortars are frequently made of wood. Small ceramic and stone vessels also may have been used as mortars (Figure 7). They appear too delicate to serve for grinding hard materials and may have been used to pulverize crusts of already prepared snuff powders immediately before use. Some of these small containers have stoppers. This type of small ceramic or stone vessel also may have served as a receptacle, or recipiente to store snuff. Small stone mortars that show signs of abrasion occur in burials at San Pedro (Figure 8a, c). None of the six stone examples of possible mortars examined from the San Pedro de Atacama culture collections showed any evidence of fire. The Maud of the Amazon Basin used wooden pestles to grind seeds in small mortars of nutshells in making hallucinogenic snuff (Wassen 1965:61). Calabashes are re- ported to have been used as mortars by a neighboring tribe, the Mura (Wass6n 1965:63). Stone pestles are used with the mortars. Typical examples measure 7 cm to 8 cm long with a diameter of about 1.5 cm to 2 cm and are carefully shaped with one tapering end showing abrasion (Figure 8b, c). Spatulas and spoons small enough to fit into the mortars or receptacles are part of the basic hallucinatory equipment. These implements are made of bone and of wood (Figure 6a, b). The cleaning implements sometimes found associated with the tabletas and tubes are made of bundles of thorns or cactus spines up to 15 cm long. Their use is clearly indicated in the case of an inhaling tube from Brazil that still contains its companion cleaning implement (Wassen 1965, Figure 21). One type of storage receptacle for powders is a bone tube, probably of camelid bone (Figure 8g, h). They are polished, including the rim, and sometimes are found complete with stoppers and seals. The wider distal end of many tubes gives a funnel shape to one end of the container. Storage of powders in jaguar</page><page sequence="9">Paletas and Tabletas 329 bone tubes is reported for the western Amazon area (Wassdn 1967:270). Gourds and sea shells also are commonly used as storage containers (Wassen 1972:2, Wass6n 1965:51, Figure 16). Bamboo tubes with stoppers are currently used in the Amazon Basin (Wass6n 1972: 40-41). Other types of receptacles, probably an alternate form for holding snuff powders for inhaling, include effigy vessels of stone or wood with a depression, usually on the back of the figure. One example is in the form of a man with a jaguar on his back, with a depression in the back of the jaguar. This may be a representation of the idea of a "double" or "alter-ego" (Torres 1987:Plate 193). Two other examples in the form of bird effigies made of argillite, or metamor- phosed mudstone, are found in the collection of the Museo del Instituto de Investi- gaciones Arqueol6gicas at San Pedro de Atacama (Figure 10a, b). The provenience of Figure 10a is unknown other than that it was found at the site of Tchaputchana by if al g Figure 9. a-f.

The other bird effigy, Figure 10b, is from a burial at the site of Sequitor, also in the San Pedro de Atacama area. The beak and head show it is a condor, a frequent theme in decorations of tabletas and tubes. No signs of abrasion were seen in the depressions of either bird effigy receptacle. A wooden bird effigy with a depression in its back is reported from Quitor 1 (LePaige 1964, Plate 17). Place of Origin Snuff ceremonialism with use of hallucinogens crosscuts cultural and linguis- tic boundaries and is an ancient custom in the New World. The oldest snuff tablets known are those found in archaeological sites on the coast of Peru and northern Chile. These trays occur in sites that date from about 1300 to 500 B.C. along with the earliest appearance of agriculture and ceramics in those areas. The "snuff pipes" from Guerrero in Mexico may date to the same time as the trays and tubes</page><page sequence="11">Paletas and Tabletas 331 from Peru and Chile (Furst 1974:6, 12). A number of scholars now accept that snuffing hallucinogens probably originated in the Amazon Basin. The rectangular snuff tray, however, may have originated in Peru (Torres 1986:50). "Transandine contacts" as well as "longitudinal coastal ones" are indicated (Engel 1963:85). Trade routes provided contacts for the spread of snuffing. The people of the San Pedro de Atacama area in northern Chile were at a crossroads for trade routes. Cabeza de Vaca recorded traffic in hallucinogenic red mescal beans on the coast of Texas (Schultes and Hofman 1980:157). Itinerant medicine men who specialized in medicinal plants are said to have travelled from Bolivia to Mexico in modern times (von Reis Altschul 1967:308). The burden bearer is frequently depicted in Mexican and Hohokam pottery decoration (Haury 1976:Figure 17.2). Geographic Distribution The history of snuffing and its distribution in the Antilles and South America is discussed by Torres (1987:Preface, I), who points out that it has existed among "diverse cultural backgrounds and linguistic affiliations." Snuffing of hallucino- genic powders also probably was practiced in Central America. As previously mentioned, archaeological evidence exists in the form of bird effigy snuffers from Costa Rica (Wassdn 1967: Figures 4 and 10). In Mexico, work by Furst (1974:10) has provided archaeological evidence for snuffing hallucinogenic powders as far north as southern Nayarit near the west coast. Human effigy figurines inhaling snuff from gourd-shaped snuff pipes or "nosepipes," a device consisting of container and inhaling tube, were found in Colima and dated by Furst to the time of the West Mexican shaft-and-chamber tomb art complex, about 100 B.C. to A.D. 200 (1974: 10, Plates 1-2). One figurine is wearing a horn-like headdress that recalls the hornlike projection seen on the head of an effigy snuff pipe from Xochipala (Furst 1974:Plate 5, and Figure 13b). The horn projecting from the head of the Xochipala effigy snuff pipe is the nosepiece (Furst 1974:14). The figure of the "burden bearer" portrayed on a Sacaton plate appears to have a similar horned headdress (Haury 1976:345, Figure 17.2d). A number of ceramic snuffers resembling the Costa Rican snuff pipes pub- lished by Wassin (1967:Figure 4) have been found in west coast Mexico and dated at 100 B.C. to A.D. 200-300 (Furst 1974:Plate 3). One example from Ixtlin del Rio, Nayarit, is a bird effigy with a bifurcated tube nosepiece that symbolizes the tail (Furst 1974:Plate 3 and Figure 10c). Southwest of Colima and southern Nayarit near Xochipala, Guerrero, both effigy and undecorated snuff pipes have been found. These snuff pipes probably date from 1300 to 1000 B.C., an age com- parable, or almost comparable, to that of the oldest snuffing implements found in Peru (Furst 1974:6, 12). Apparently the rectangular stone tray as well as bowl-type snuffers existed in western Mexico. A stone palette in human effigy form is known from Guerrero</page><page sequence="12">332 LOWELL (Haury 1976:Figures 1.24 and 1 la). Other examples of rectangular stone palettes have been noted in Mexico by Emil W. Haury (personal communication, 1988) and Constantino M. Torres (personal communication, 1988). The greatest abun- dance of small wood and stone tablets occurs in the Hohokam sites of southern Arizona and in sites in the San Pedro de Atacama area in northern Chile; these widely separated areas are bridged by archaeological evidence of snuffing in Costa Rica and Mexico. Areas of Concentration The two places of greatest concentration of distinctive rectangular tablets with sides often slightly concave and a depression framed with a border are the Southwestern part of the United States, where probably as many as 1,000 Hohokam palettes have been recovered (Stephen H. Lekson, personal communi- cation, 1988), and the pre-Andean region of San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, in South America, where a total of about 561 are known (Constantino M. Torres, personal communication, 1988). This picture may be distorted by conditions of preservation. Durable stone tablets, such as those of the Hohokam, have a high rate of survival despite the Hohokam practice of disposal or sacrifice of some kinds of property by breakage and burning. Wooden palettes probably would not have survived in the Hohokam area in any case because of the practice of cremation. Wood is almost as durable as stone in the unique conditions found in the Atacama Desert, ensuring a high survival rate for wooden tabletas de rapd in the area of San Pedro de Atacama. Wooden tabletas could have been more common elsewhere in South America and did not survive where conditions of preservation were poor for wood. Stone tablets do occur in South America in significant num- bers, but wood is a much more common material. Bone tablets are found in desert areas, but are relatively scarce. Gold tablets and copper tablets were probably al- ways rare. Conditions of preservation thus may not have affected the picture of areas of concentration other than to make wooden tablets more rare in areas where preservation was poor. The intensity of excavation also has been greater in areas of known archaeological interest such as the southwestern United States and the San Pedro de Atacama. Coincidence in Time Hohokam chronology has been the subject of much controversy (Haury 1976; Gladwin 1948; Di Peso 1956; McGuire and Schiffer 1982). Hohokam palettes usually are found in cremation areas or burials where they are often associated with ceramics in grave offerings. These ceramics have been dated by stratigraphic and typological methods and in some cases have been dated by crossdating with intrusive pottery types for which tree ring dates are available. Chronometric dating</page><page sequence="13">Paletas and Tabletas 333 including radiocarbon and archaeomagnetic methods have also produced dates for some Hohokam phases. Current thinking places the beginning of the Hohokam Pioneer period around A.D. 300 or even later (McGuire and Schiffer 1982:308). Some earlier chronologies placed the beginning of the Hohokam Pioneer period at 300 B.C. (Haury: 1976:338, Table 16.1). Palette use appears to date from the earliest period at Snaketown (Haury 1976:286), thus making them one more element of Hohokam culture pointing southward to the place of origin for many traits. A few palettes are found in Pioneer period context (A.D. 500 to 800), but the time of greatest abundance was during the Colonial and Sedentary periods (A.D. 800 to 1150). Palettes are virtu- ally absent from Classic period cultural remains (A.D. 1150 to 1450). The chronology used for the San Pedro de Atacama culture is that suggested by Torres (1987:39-40). Snuff trays are most commonly found in association with the Black Polished ("Negro pulido") pottery associated with Phase II, and the Black Semi- Polished ("Negro casi pulido") pottery associated with San Pedro III. Seven tabletas (Torres 1987:40) have been found in tombs with the Red Polished ("Rojo pulido"), pottery of San Pedro I, and a few tabletas also are known from burials containing the Purplish Red ("Rojo violdicea") pottery of late San Pedro III. From approximately A.D. 300 to 1000, the occurrence of Black Polished and Black Semi-Polished pottery coincides with the maximum concentration of table- tas de rape" at San Pedro de Atacama. As Hohokam palettes were most numerous during Colonial and Sedentary times, from approximately A.D. 800 to 1150, it is apparent that though palettes first occur at San Pedro de Atacama several hundred years earlier, there is close coincidence in time for the greatest abundance of this type of artifact for the Hohokam and for the culture of the San Pedro de Atacama area (Figure 2). If the earlier dates for the Hohokam Pioneer period (300 B.C. to A.D. 300) suggested by Haury (1976:338) are applicable, the time of first occurr- ence of palettes in Hohokam sites also coincides closely with dates in the San Pedro de Atacama region. Dates for the Muisca trays from Colombia are A.D. 645 + 95 and A.D. 960 e 90 (Torres 1987:21-22), which coincides with the time of greatest abundance in the Southwestern United States and northern Chile. It should be remembered that snuff trays occur elsewhere, such as in coastal areas in Peru and Northern Chile, and probably in western Mexico, at much earlier horizons, around 1300 to 1200 B.C. Most snuff trays from the northwestern Argentina area are late (A.D. 1000-1538) and snuffing is still practiced today in that area as well as in parts of the Amazon Basin. Within this great span of time, the two areas of greatest concentration of trays appear to have coincided in time. PARALLELS BETWEEN PALETTES AND TABLETAS Similarities between the Hohokam paint palettes and the snuff trays or table- tas de rapde can be analyzed according to certain attributes such as size, form, manner of decoration, and materials from which the trays are made.</page><page sequence="14">334 LOWELL Size The palettes and tabletas are very similar in size. Lengths reported for a total of 325 palettes from Snaketown vary from 4.8 cm to 35.0 cm (Haury 1976:253; Gladwin and others 1938: Plate 97). Most Hohokam palettes measure from 6 cm to 35 cm in length (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 97; Haury 1976:286). Most palettes are about 15 cm long, but the size range known for the Hohokam palettes is increased by relatively rare miniature specimens. A worked potsherd from Snaketown measures 2.7 cm wide by 4.8 cm long (Haury 1976:253). Two other miniatures were found at Los Muertos, made from Colonial palettes reused in Classic times (Haury 1976:140). One measures about 2.5 cm by 5 cm in size; the other about 5 cm by 5 cm. One, or possibly both, had been "pierced for suspen- sion" (Haury 1945:140, Plate 62, c and d). A current study of Hohokam palettes by Steven H. Lekson will define palette size range more completely. Rectangular tabletas de rape, or snuff trays, from South America vary in length from approximately 10 cm to 30 cm, according to Torres (1987:1). Mea- surements of ancient South American snuff trays fall within these limits. Junius Bird (1943:226) believed that a small tray found in a burial in an early context on the northern coast of Chile to be a model because of its small size (11 cm long by 4 cm wide) and also because of its rough workmanship and the presence of other models of a balsa or boat, a paddle, and harpoons in the same burial. Form Analogies also are apparent in the form of Hohokam palettes and the snuff trays (Figures 3 and 4). According to Haury (1976:286), palettes began as "flat tabular stones which soon were modified into rectangular form with a pronounced rim and depressed central portion." The most common form during the Colonial period after A.D. 800 is "a simple rectangular shape having slightly concave mar- gins, square corners, and high incised borders" (Haury 1976:286). Human effigy and animal effigy palettes that bear a rectangular depression also are present (Fig- ure 1 ib). Round palettes are found, but only rarely. Sedentary period palettes showed a general deterioration in workmanship with a change to a wider form, sometimes trapezoidal with a wider upper end. The rectangular palettes may have flat projections from the end, which may be handles (Figure 12a). This palette shape appears analogous to some tabletas de rape of the Maui of the Amazon Basin (Figure 12b). One Colonial period palette found at Snaketown has flat extensions at both ends (Figure 4b; Gladwin and others: 1938, Plate 100). The palette form may have had a utilitarian origin that evolved from a metate or grinding stone as demonstrated by changes in typology apparent at Snaketown (Haury 1976:287-288). Some of the primitive-appearing prototype palettes found at the Swarts Ruin, a Classic period Mimbres site in southwestern New Mexico (Haw- ley 1947:73), contain traces of lead that are characteristic of Hohokam palettes.</page><page sequence="15">Paletas and Tabletas 335 Ui / // e /" a b c Figure 11. Human effigy palettes from a. Guerrero, Mexico, Classic period, length 29 cm; b. Hohokam, Colonial period, length 26.8 cm (after Haury 1976: Figure 14.24); and c. San Pedro de Atacama, length 10.5 cm (after Berenguer 1984:15). The possible evolution of palettes from grinding stones is interesting in view of an account describing snuff paraphernalia for the Guahibo of eastern Colombia by Spruce in 1908: "The seeds being first roasted, are powdered on a wooden plat- ter, nearly the shape of a watch-glass, but rather longer than broad (9/4 in. by 8 in.). It is held on the knee by a broad thin handle, which is grasped in the left hand while the fingers of the right hold a small spatula or pestle of the hard wood of the Palo de Arco (Tecomae sp.) with which the seeds are crushed" (Wassdn 1965:104). An illustration of this type of snuff tray has been published by Wassdn (1965:Figure 52). Hohokam stone effigy receptacles generally are sculptured in the full round with a cavity in the back, but also may be tabular, in the shape of the animal, with details added with incised lines (Figure 10c, d). Some palettes of typical rectangu- lar shape have the animal carved in relief into the palette surface. The human fig- ure also was used in effigy palettes, with the cavity on the front (Figure 1 lb). There are possible parallels for these effigy-shaped vessels in South Ameri- can animal effigy forms. The litos from shell middens of southern Brazil and east- ern Uruguay are stone effigy figures in animal form, mainly birds, and human form with a cavity on the back (Figure 13). These also were used in inhaling snuff powders, according to some early reports (Wassen 1967:251-253).</page><page sequence="16">336 LOWELL a Figure 12. Handle-like projections on a.

A human effigy bowl snuffer pictured by Furst (1974:Plate 5) from Xochipala, Guerrero, Mexico, exhibits several details possibly analogous with a possible stone censer from Cache 1.10G at Snaketown (Figure 14; Haury 1976: Figure 11.24). In the two examples the male figures are lying or sitting with knees drawn up, the receptacle located on the belly or between the legs. Another parallel may be found in the antropdlito de Mercedes, a stone human effigy figure from Uruguay with a rectangular cavity on its front side "in the style of the Mexican 'Chacmool' figures," (Wass6n 1967:251). A similar reclining figure with bent</page><page sequence="17">Paletas and Tabletas 337 knees decorates the flat extension on a wooden tray from San Pedro de Atacama (Torres 1987:106). The form of the snuff trays, according to Torres (1987:2), is that of tablets with "a rectangular shallow cavity, although in rare cases it is round or ovoid, sur- rounded by a border or frame," and "the depression ranges in depth from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. The interior and exterior edges are often concave" (Torres 1986:38). One or more "handle-like appendages usually extend perpendicularly from one of the narrow sides of the cavity frame" (Torres 1987:2). These extensions may be plain or decorated with patterns of geometric elements or figures carved in low relief or full round. Round tabletas, such as the one pictured in a burial at Caspana in the San Pedro area (LePaige 1965:Plate 34) are rare. Most of the earliest tabletas known from the desert coasts of Peru and northern Chile are rectangular. Near Arica, Chile, however, varieties of forms are found. One ancient tray is in the shape of an animal paw, which recalls the "half fist" motif characteristic of the Tihuanaco and San Pedro de Atacama areas. Others are made from sea shells, or are in a similar shape (Torres 1987:Plates 24 and 25). e~ " :i; e'' .t' d e' ee ~e "2 eee.:~ C '''~~ e:. .e.e ':e: I ee Ie il~: rc~e. e..e .;e. - ~F~t-'ie':L!G.: ... eee.:e b __~----~-e \ r ;:ee. ~f~~:['e:;~: ie.e.- .. : . e:e`~: Is~~ e-::e .Z .1:::~ '9 e.: ,~ :::;' " ~i-----7- i :'I \e e/ k a m d e f e,e e~c~-e!

A snuff tray from the Amazon area has as deco- ration a prone female figure with a feline on her back, recalling the "alter-ego" effigy vessel with the jaguar on a man's back. A variant on this theme is the human figure with the cavity in front, which appears both in effigy receptacles and in snuff trays (Figure 1 Ic). The antropdlito de Mercedes is a human effigy form with a cavity in front (Wassen 1967:25). A snuff tray from the coast of northern Chile in anthropomorphic form has the de- pression in front (Torres 1987:Plate 28). Other trays from San Pedro de Atacama and northern Argentina appear to be conventionalized reclining human figures with heads sculptured in the round and a cavity in front, though lacking hands and feet (Torres 1987:Plates 97, 99, 107, 163, 174). Bird symbolism is an important theme in snuff utensil decoration. Wass6n (1967:244, Figure 5) noted the close analogy between a bifurcated bird-shaped wooden snuffing tube from Brazilian Guayana to the bird-shaped clay snuffers from Costa Rica (1967:243, Figure 4). Ceramic, bifurcated bird-form snuffers have since been found in Nayarit, Mexico (Figure 13; Furst 1974:10, Plate 3). The armadillo theme is represented both on receptacles described by Uhle as tabletas and on a handlelike appendage on a snuff tray from San Pedro de Atacama (Torres 1987:2, Plate 123). The Mexican figurines using gourd effigy snuffers are remi- niscent of the Colombian figurines holding rectangular snuff trays (Torres 1987:19). In view of the use of leaves, tabletops, sea shells, and a variety of inhal- ing tubes to hold snuff powder for inhaling, the additional use of effigy vessels, including the one-piece snuffers, seems not unlikely. Border A basic feature of the form of both palettes and tabletas is the border that frames the central depression. In Hohokam stone palettes the border usually is raised from about 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm above the central depression. The border may be defined only by an incised line in late specimens from the Sedentary period (A.D. 1000 to 1150), but it is invariably present except on some of the earliest Pioneer period "proto-palettes" (A.D. 500). The ancient snuff trays reported by Bird (1943, 1948) and Engel (1963) also have a raised border around a central depression. The stone trays examined at the Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas in San Pedro de Atacama have borders raised from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm above the central depression, whereas the bone specimen has a border raised 0.6 cm above a depression with sloping sides, except for the top end where the border was defined by an incised line. The more com- mon wooden trays also have a similar raised border or frame. A framed rectangu- lar shape for the snuff receptacle is the most common form in all areas.</page><page sequence="20">340 LOWELL a b Figure 15. Stone trays from San Pedro de Atacama area (courtesy Museo del In- stituto de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas Gustavo LePaige S.J. de la Universidad del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama). Decoration The earliest Hohokam palettes are undecorated tablets ground from hard crys- talline rocks with undecorated borders or no border. This simplest type of palette occurs occasionally through all periods and is the only type found in the earliest levels at Snaketown (Haury 1976:286). Recent thinking dates these levels at around A.D. 500 (McGuire and Shiffer 1982:Figure 8.1). Decorative techniques seen in Colonial palettes include incised lines, carving in low relief, sculpturing in full round, and painting. Raised borders 1 mm to 2 mm high are decorated with one to five parallel incised lines and ticking around the outer rim (Figure 4a). More rarely borders are carved in low relief (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 102). The sides of borders often are decorated with one to three medial incised lines. Planiform extensions are covered with patterns of incised lines. Surfaces are smoothly finished. Sculptured life forms are attached directly to the sides of the borders on one or both ends (Figures 11 a, 12a). Effigy</page><page sequence="21">Paletas and Tabletas 341 forms may be sculptured in the full round or be outlined by incised lines. Work- manship began to decline after A.D. 1000 in the Sedentary period, and decoration became limited to more carelessly incised running patterns on the tops of borders. Black and yellow painted areas alternate with incised lines on the wider, flatter borders of some Sedentary period palettes (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 104). A Sedentary period palette with red pigment on the incised pattern on its borders is in the collections of the Arizona State Museum in Tucson. Traces of red paint also were seen on an early, otherwise undecorated palette. Perishable painted decora- tions may have originally been common. Snuff tray decoration techniques include incised lines, carving in low and high relief, and sculpture carved in the full round. These techniques were gener- ally used throughout the time of use of tabletas (Torres 1986:47). Approximately 25 percent of South American snuff trays are undecorated (Torres 1987:53). Incised lines form geometric patterns and in combination with perforations depict zoomorphic themes on planiform extensions (Torres 1984:25). Relief carv- ings of human or animal figures also appear on the flat, sometimes handle-like, extensions. Full round carvings project directly from the edge of the upper border of the rectangular receptacle (Figure 3a). Eyes or details of decoration may be embellished with polished turquoise or malachite, or bits of gold or shell, fixed in place by vegetable resin adhesives. Most early trays from the Arica area or from the coast of Peru are undecorated (Torres 1987:34). Red paint was smeared on both sides of one ancient tray as well as on other grave furnishings at Arica (Torres 1987:33-34). Possibly the paint was used according to burial custom and was not for decoration in this case. Red and a D Figure 16. a and b.

The stone itself furnishes a decorative effect for stone trays from San Pedro de Atacama (Figure 15). It is a banded tuff that forms a marbled pattern in gray and pink or yellow when carved. Design Motifs and Themes Hohokam design motifs in palette decoration began with patterns of incised lines and ticking or notching of edges. Simple running patterns of geometric fig- ures fill borders (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 100). More complex herringbone or chevron patterns fill surfaces of flat extensions (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 100). Animal and bird themes are characteristic of the later Colonial period (A.D. 875 to 1000). Low relief carvings that form patterns on borders usually represent reptiles. The prominence of the snake in Hohokam art is in harmony with its im- portance in Mexican art traditions. Bird motifs were a favorite theme in Hohokam art, and pelicans and roadrunners are prominently depicted on palettes. Some of the contents of Cache 1:1OG at Snaketown appear to have a sexual theme as seen in the penis handles of some stone vessels as well as detailed depic- tion of male genitalia on an effigy vessel made of softer mudstone (Haury 1976:- Figures 11.25 and 11.26). Coyotes, or possibly foxes, are shown on one palette from Snaketown (Glad- win and others 1938:Plate 101). The same animal may be seen on a Colonial palette from the Hodges site (Kelly 1978:Figure 7.4). Full round carved decora- tive elements attached to the upper and lower edges of palettes more commonly depict rattlesnakes and birds, probably road runners, sometimes together. Animals represented on Hohokam effigy receptacles include snakes, lizards, tortoises, birds, pelicans, ducks, and bears or dogs (Haury 1976:190). Individual characteristics are sufficiently realistic to distinguish different kinds of lizards (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 102). The human figure also was used in effigy palettes and in decorating bowl-shaped receptacles. Motifs and themes represented on South American snuff trays are more numerous and complex than those crafted by the Hohokam. A comprehensive study of the themes and iconography of South American snuff trays was published in 1987 by Torres. For purposes of this study elements and techniques of the deco- ration are summarized. Motifs include stepped elements, parallel lines, concentric circles, semicir- cles, rectangles, and triangles. Some motifs of incised lines may represent pat- terns of flames, plants, or feathers (Torres 1987:71, 92-94). Human and animal heads are shown frontally or in profile. Motifs are used in purely "non-objective" decoration filling flat areas (Torres 1987:Plates 124-125). Figures of animals or human beings or of personages with combined human and animal features are por-</page><page sequence="23">Paletas and Tabletas 343 trayed standing and kneeling, frontally and in profile. Some human figures are re- clining in prone position, or seated, or reclining with bent knees. Feline, bird, and snake themes are important in all snuff-using areas of South America. Other animals such as camelids, reptiles, armadillos, and fish also are represented (Torres 1984:33-34). Human and animal figures, as well as figures with combined human and animal traits, also represent iconographic themes. Some iconographic figures indicate Tihuanaco influence. Others are of pan- Andean occurrence (Torres 1987:42). In South America, decapitation was associated with the inhalation of hallu- cinogens. The "Sacrificer" personage associated with human sacrifice by decapi- tation is frequently found on snuff trays from northern Chile and Bolivia (Torres 1987:44). This personage also is represented in rock art in northern Chile, in Puca- ri ceramics from Bolivia, and in monumental stone sculpture at San Agustin in Colombia (Torres 1987:49). At San Pedro de Atacama four decapitated bodies along with four skulls and inhalatory equipment, including a tray decorated with four anthropomorphic figures, were found in a burial at Quitor (Torres 1984:31). Some snuff trays have reclining figures that possibly represent sacrificial victims (Llagostera 1984:19; Torres 1987:Plate 105). In these cases the function of the snuff tray may have included use of the narcotic to stupefy the victim (Llagostera 1984:19). Animal themes such as jaguars and birds may symbolize changes in percep- tions experienced by users of psychoactive substances thus showing a relationship between decorative themes and the use of hallucinogens (Torres 1984:33). Con- temporary users report sensations of floating or flying, metamorphosis, and strange auditory sensations during an altered state which suggests that the iconog- raphy symbolizes some of the sensations experienced with the use of hallucino- gens (Berenguer 1984:15). Users of the Precolumbian snuff trays also probably sought contact with supernatural powers. The figures with combined anthropo- morphic-zoomorphic features may represent transformation of the snuff user into an animal such as a feline or bird (Torres 1987:85-86). Representations of snakes are common on snuff trays made by the Maue of the Amazon Basin (Wassen 1967:283, 1965:Figures 8, 10-12, and 15). Some Maud trays have handle-like projections from the top end that represent the heads of snakes with protruding tongues. These tongues sometimes have a penis shape (Wass6n 1965:Figure 11). The Maud people sprang from the union of a woman and a snake, according to tradition (Torres 1987:70). A similar handle appears on a tray from San Pedro de Atacama (Torres 1987:Plate 134). A reptile sculptured in the round on a tray from San Pedro de Atacama appears to be a rattlesnake, al- though there are no snakes in northern Chile. In summary, South American snuff trays are characterized by a predominant rectangular shape, often with concave sides, with a raised border that frames a rec- tangular central depression. Flat extensions from one end are common. Decora-</page><page sequence="24">344 LOWELL tion frequently includes carved appendages attached directly to the border as well as ornamentation of the flat extensions with geometric patterns of incised lines, low relief carvings, and full round sculptured figures. Hohokam palettes share these characteristics with the exception of the ornamentation of flat extensions with low relief carvings and sculptured figures. Also, Hohokam decoration themes do not include felines or the iconographic personages such as the "Sacri- ficer" or alter-ego transformation figures. Material Snuff trays were made of many different materials. The material used in mak- ing snuff trays seems to have been less fixed in custom than form and style of decoration. Wood and stone were used most frequently. A tray from San Pedro de Atacama is probably made of camelid bone. The bone tableta from Huaca Prieta is of whale bone (Wassen 1967:256). Gold and copper tabletas are known from Colombia (Torres 1987:Figure 21). The development of decorative techniques for Hohokam palettes appears to have been influenced by the material. The hard, crystalline rocks used for the sim- pler palettes can only be worked with advanced stone-working techniques. The more elaborately decorated stone palettes which began after A.D. 700 were carved from a softer, schistose rock. No wood or bone palettes are known for the Hohokam. Perishable materials such as wood are preserved only in rare instances such as accidental impressions in clay, cave sites such as Double Butte, or in Cache 2:9F at Snaketown, where smothering of the sacrificial fire preserved some materials by carbonization (Haury 1976:176). Bone artifacts do occur among Hohokam cultural remains, often broken and blackened by fire, but bone was apparently not used to make palettes. Wood is the most commonly used material for snuff trays and inhaling tubes in northern Chile. In the Atacama Desert conditions for the preservation of usually perishable materials are unique. Six stone tabletas from San Pedro de Atacama were identified during this study. One is in the collection of the Museo de Arte Precolumbino in Santiago, Chile. One is mentioned in Group 2 of exhibits in a catalog for an exhibit in Santiago, Chile (LePaige 1977), and four are in the col- lection of the Museo del Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas in San Pedro de Atacama. All are made of a relatively soft, indurated tuff. Workmanship is fair to excellent. Stone tabletas are reported elsewhere in South America, particularly in Colombia and Bolivia. In the classification of tabletas de rape by Lautaro Nufiez, one category consists of stone trays. Provenience Burials and Cremations Hohokam palettes are commonly found in cremation areas associated with human remains and other grave offerings. The virtual disappearance of palettes</page><page sequence="25">Paletas and Tabletas 345 from Hohokam sites occurred after A.D. 1175. This was also the time of appear- ance of inhumation, instead of cremation, among other changes in settlement pat- tern, architecture, and ceramics characteristic of the Salado culture. The frequent occurrence of the burned remains of a mixture containing a lead mineral on Hohokam palettes has suggested a ceremonial use during the funeral rites.It is also possible that the mixture was placed on the palettes, perhaps as a paint, for use in the funeral rites and the burning was simply coincidental with the cremation. The snuff trays are most commonly found in burials. They may occur sepa- rately, be accompanied only by an inhaling tube, or be included in a pouch con- taining the full kit of inhalatory equipment. Some tabletas have been found in burials with associations that indicate specific ceremonial use, such as accom- panying human sacrifice. Other tabletas and inhalatory complex utensils may be present simply as grave offerings. Burial customs of the San Pedro de Atacama culture include flexed position of the body, use of funeral masks, clothing the body in fine textiles and head cov- erings of turbans and caps, elaborate hair-dressing, and the inclusion of grave offerings of ceramics, personal possessions such as tools and weapons, food, and the equipment for inhaling hallucinogens. Bodies are seated on woven mats. Uniquely favorable conditions for preservation make possible a detailed inventory of original grave contents. Funeral customs at Asia in Peru consisted of burying the dead in oval pits, generally in a flexed position, bundled in layers of fabrics, enclosed in mats (Engel 1963:67, 70-71). Grave furnishings included small tablets of bone and wood; inhaling tubes, also of bone and wood; bone spatulas; bags for snuff uten- sils, as well as plant materials (Engel 1963:85). Cups carved of bone or gourd also are found (Engel 1963:98). In a burial at Nifio Korin in Bolivia, broken arrow- shafts occur, a possible parallel with the custom of including "intentionally broken pottery" as grave offerings in other burials in Bolivia and Peru (Wass6n 1972:25). Snuff paraphernalia and offerings of hallucinogenic plants were associated with the broken arrowshafts at Nifio Korin (Wass6n 1972:24). Artifacts of ceramic, stone, and bone found in Hohokam caches and cremations often have been pur- posely broken and burned. Ethnographic evidence of the inclusion of hallucinogenic snuff equipment among grave offerings exists, as for the Cashuena of the Trombetas and Cachorro rivers in Brazil (Wassen 1967:279). Modern use of narcotic snuff in other cere- monies also is known. The Waica Indians of Brazil use snuff in an annual memo- rial ceremony for the dead (Schultes 1979:Figure 10). The Sanemai tribe in south- ern Venezuela also use narcotic snuff at a death festival (Wass6n 1965:98). The Cubeo of eastern Colombia use snuff with other narcotics during a mourning cere- mony (Wass6n 1965:102). Cremation was apparently not a custom among hallucinogen-using tribes of South America, but there is some evidence of secondary burial. At Asia, secon-</page><page sequence="26">346 LOWELL dary burial of clean bones, as well as burial shortly after death, was practiced (Engel 1963: 69). Clean bones were found in one burial of a beheaded adult and in four child burials (Engel 1963:69). "Secondary urn burial" is reported for the Tucuna who live on the trans-Andean trade route from the Chicama river valley on the north coast of Peru across the Andes to Jaen in the Amazon Basin (Wassen 1965: 80, 82). At Arica on the northern coast of Chile, the mummies of "compli- cated preparation" from the Chinchorro culture represent another form of secon- dary burial. Snuff trays occur in levels of the Faldas del Morro culture (Mostny 1983:75). Dates for the Faldas del Morro culture are 500 B.c. to A.D. 500, with the earlier Chinchorro culture reaching back to pre-agriculture and pre- ceramic hori- zons of around 3000 B.c.(Hans Niemier, Director of the Museo de Historia Natural, Santiago, personal communication, 1990). Caches Hohokam stone palettes also occur in caches. Hohokam custom apparently involved the ritual disposal of some kinds of cultural materials, such as animal and human figurines, or stone and ceramic vessels, probably following ceremonial use. These artifacts, together with other materials such as pigments, shell jewelry and ornaments, pyrite mirrors, charred food, textiles, basketry, and matting, were deliberately broken and burned before burial in a randomly dug pit (Haury 1976:175, 190). No human bones have been found in any of the caches known for Snaketown, and their contents may be from ceremonies unrelated to funeral rites or cremation. A possible example is Cache 2:9F, which contains plant materials suggesting a harvest ceremony as well as a piece of a broken palette. This associa- tion is questionable as the palette fragment was possibly already present in trash at the time the cache was made (Haury 1976:183). The burning of ceremonial mate- rials following their use is common among Indians of northwestern Mexico such as the Yaqui. The custom of making caches has persisted to recent times among the Pima Indians of Arizona (Haury 1976:190). At Asia, in Peru, pits of the same size and shape as the graves, but that con- tain no human remains contain snuffing paraphernalia and other materials that may represent caches (Engel 1963:67). The snuff utensils are associated with other artifacts, plant materials, and textiles, wrapped in mats and interred in the same manner as the dead (Engel 1963:75). Pit 36 contained a complete kit for in- haling hallucinogens as well as "organic paste," "gray powder," and "black seeds" (Engel 1963:120). Houses and Trash Hohokam palettes also are found in house or trash areas. In some cases this probably resulted from the disturbance of burials. Also, broken palettes may have been disposed of as ordinary trash. Some snuff tablets of unknown provenience in the San Pedro de Atacama area</page><page sequence="27">Paletas and Tabletas 347 as well as some found in living areas in trash may be the result of the disturbance of what were originally tomb contents. Burials dating from later occupations were found in house areas in Tulor (Llagostera and others 1984:139). Much of the early excavating in the San Pedro de Atacama area was done selectively in cemetery areas (Augustin Llagostera, personal communication, 1988). With further study of living areas in future excavations more information on the provenience of table- tas de rape and other items of the inhalatory complex will become available. OTHER POSSIBLE PARAPHERNALIA Some Hohokam artifacts other than palettes also have possible parallels with utensils used in inhaling hallucinogens in South America. One example is a type of bone tube similar to those used to store snuff powder. Hohokam small ceramic and stone vessels are considered to be censers, though not all show signs of burn- ing. Use of some of the small stone vessels as mortars also has been suggested (Haury 1976:189). Pestles and possible pestles of suitable size to use with these small vessels also occur. Some Hohokam bone tubes resemble the incised tube receptacles found in the San Pedro area (Figure 9a-f). Hohokam bone tubes were made of deer or antelope bone and were both plain and decorated. Plain tubes are found sparsely throughout Pioneer through Sedentary periods at Snaketown, whereas the decorated tubes are limited to Pioneer times (Haury 1976:304). Thus the time of occurrence for bone tubes coincides with that of the palettes. The most common form of decoration on Hohokam bone tubes consists of cross-hachured geometric patterns. One instance of the use of life-form elements has been noted (Gladwin and others 1938:Plate 127). In some instances tubes show evidence of wear from handling (Haury 1976:304). Though articular ends have been cut off, one end may be broader and more conelike in shape, giving them a form somewhat like a powder horn. No evidence of stoppers or plugs was observed during this study. Ends are beveled and smoothed, which together with the evidence of handling has led to the suggestion they were possibly used as suck- ing tubes in healing ceremonies (Haury 1976:304). Provenience of most known specimens is from trash, though two were found on house floors (Haury 1976:304). Only one occurrence of a bone tube is known from cremations at Snaketown (Haury 1976:166). The apparent absence of inhaling tubes may be because perishable materials were used, or perhaps they have not been recognized. It would be interesting to reexamine a tube-like object with a "uniform 1/4-inch bore from end to end" (Haury 1945:144, Figure 87e). Some turkey bone "beads" appear to be long enough for use as inhaling tubes. An association of artifacts apparently unique to the Hohokam is the use of small ceramic vessels with palettes. This functional re- lationship is indicated by materials from Cache l:9F (Haury 1976:176, 288). The</page><page sequence="28">348 LOWELL censers show fire marks and blackening by carbon that match stains on the stone palette, showing where they stood. Other examples of possible censers show signs of extreme heat and carbon stains on their inside surfaces (Haury 1976:227). Ves- tigial contents are present in some of these small ceramic vessels. Some also show evidence of abrasion inside. Another instance of the association of palettes with small ceramic vessels is seen in the occurrence of a "heavy-walled vessel" resting on a large palette in Cremation 18:5F (Haury 1976:165). This specialized type of small ceramic vessel appears to have been intended for a particular use, possibly for the burning of an organic substance (Haury 1976:227-228). Heavy-walled vessels appear to be a late trait, but they are not found in Classic sites after A.D. 1100 (Haury 1976:228). The evidence of the use of fire with this specialized vessel and the association with palettes indicates a functional association late in the time of palette use, perhaps indicating evolution in the ritual practices involving the use of palettes. Possible censers or mortars made of stone (Figure 16) occur mainly in caches, and none have been found associated with palettes. These small stone vessels are found in caches associated with what appear to be ceremonial materials (Haury 1976:190). Some small stone vessels contain vestigial contents. Some, but not all, appear to show evidence of burning of contents. Other types of small stone vessels found in Hohokam sites are apparently analogous to small stone mortars and pestles from San Pedro de Atacama. Two small pestles, one of which has red paint on both ends, are among the stone carv- ing tools found in Cache 1:10G (Haury 1976:189). They provide indirect evidence that some of the small stone vessels were used as mortars (Haury 1976:189). Small stone mortars of both a flat and a "cup shaped" form from the Classic period site of Los Muertos probably were used to grind paint pigments (Haury 1945:128). Only one pestle of suitable shape for use in the cup-shaped form of mortar was found at Los Muertos. It is a "plummet-shaped specimen of lava...31/4 inches in length and shows a minimum amount of wear on the large end" (Haury 1945:129, Plate 37b). Stone mortars and similar "plummet-shaped" pestles exist from the San Pedro de Atacama culture (Figure 8b, c). "Medicine stones" of a somewhat irregular pestle shape also were found in Cache 1:10G at Snaketown, one of which shows traces of the same lead silicate slag often found in crusts on palettes (Haury 1976:188). Other small stone vessels may have been used as cups. The coiled body of the snake forms the receptacle in some vessels whereas others have handles made of the twisted body of the rattlesnake (Haury 1976:Figure 11.22). A possible anal- ogy for the decorated cup-shaped stone vessels of the Hohokam may be found in the decorated bone cup from Asia on the Peruvian coast (Engel 1963:98). Another possibile analogy might be found in the "feline powder cup" pictured by Zerries (Wass~n 1965:Figure 5).</page><page sequence="29">Paletas and Tabletas 349 NARCOTIC PLANT MATERIALS Two species of tobacco are known to have been commonly used as snuff in Precolumbian America, Nicotiana tabacum and N. rustica, and the snuffing of to- bacco persists to the present in the northwestern Amazon area (Schultes 1967:292). Coca is sometimes added, and ashes of other plants commonly are mixed with the tobacco, perhaps to improve consistency (Schultes 1967: 293). Two other important hallucinogenic snuffs are prepared by people of the western and northwestern Amazon Basin today. The first is a leguminous snuff made from the seeds of two similar species of a New World genus of tree, Anadenanthera (von Reis Altschul 1967:307). Caoba (A. peregrina) is distributed from southeastern Brazil to the Caribbean area and Cebil or Vilca (A. colubrina) is found from southern Peru through Bolivia, north- ern Argentina, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. This snuff is usually prepared by roasting and pulverizing the seeds with an admixture of ashes or lime. The second is myristicaceous snuff prepared from resin obtained from scraping the inner bark of one of several species of Virola, a relative of the nutmeg (Schultes 1967:301). The bark exudate is cooked and ground to a powder, frequently with the addition of the toasted and pulverized leaves of Justicia pectoralis, an acanthaceous shrub native to open grasslands (Schultes 1967:303, 1979:213, 237). The addition of ashes of other plants such as Elizabetha princeps and wild cacao (Theobroma sub- incan) for aroma or for improved texture is sometimes reported (Schultes 1967:293). Good texture also is sometimes sought by the addition of "baked clay" (Wass6n 1965:89). Other plants less commonly used in making snuff are Ilex guayusa, a caffeine-rich holly related to mate, and a vine, Banisteropsis caapi (Furst 1974:3). No evidence has been found of the use of lead minerals or of any minerals other than clay in South American hallucinogenic snuff powders. Hallucinogenic plant materials also are found in North America. Indigenous sources exist, such as tobacco, species of Leguminosae including two species of Piptadenia, species of the related mimosa and acacia, and of Psychotria spp. and Justicia spp. (Furst 1974:2-4). Other sources are red mescal beans, datura, and peyote cactus. Historical references mention the use of hallucinogenic substances in Mexico by means other than snuffing (Furst 1974:1), but the only known evi- dence for snuffing hallucinogens in Mexico is the archaeologic evidence pre- sented by Furst. On the northwest coast of Mexico, Seri Indian informants reported halluci- nogenic effects from smoking Ruellia, a plant related to Justicia, (Felger and Moser 1985:165). The Seri name for datura indicates knowledge of its narcotic nature, but it was said to be taboo (Felger and Moser, 1985:165). Datura has been used as a narcotic in both North and South America (Schultes and Hofman 1980:285). The Hohokam apparently used cane cigarettes at the same time palettes were</page><page sequence="30">350 LOWELL abundant. Cane cigarettes in the Hohokam area have been found mostly in cave sites such as Double Butte Cave with what appear to be ceremonial offerings. Some cigarettes show evidence of burning, though none of the ones from Double Butte Cave show indications of use (Haury 1945:194). The Tohono O'odham (Papago) inhabiting part of the old Hohokam area have described offering cane cigarettes to captured enemy scalps (Underhill 1940:35). Cane cigarettes from Double Butte Cave contained a cultivated species of tobacco common in Mexico and the Caribbean area, Nicotiana tabacum (Haury 1945:194). And Nicotiana attenuata, a wild species, has been identified in cane cigarettes from northern Arizona cave sites that are dated at around 650 B.C. (Raffauf 1960:1010). Tobacco has been one of the commonest snuff materials. It is noteworthy that part of the contents of the cane cigarettes from Double Butte Cave consisted of a substance "of a woody nature highly charged with pitch" (Haury 1976:194). Occasional large pieces of this material show it to have been from the outer and resinous covering of shrub or tree (Haury 1945:194). Current testing of cane cigarette contents by Karen Adams (personal communication, 1988) is expected to provide more information about the nature of the plant mate- rials smoked by the Hohokam. HOHOKAM PALETTE CONTENTS Burning in crematory or other fires preserved part of a mixture of ingredients originally placed on the palettes in the form of crusts that still adhere to many specimens. Analyses by Hawley (Gladwin and others 1938:282, 1947:73) and more recent tests (Haury 1976:288) have shown that this mixture of substances in- cluded a lead mineral. Of the 320 palettes examined by Hawley (1947:73), 278 had crusts containing lead. Other constituents of the mixture probably were water, as indicated by the boiling and spattering of the mixture, ashes, and organic mate- rial "such as cactus juice or mesquite gum" according to Hawley (1938:284-286). The crusts vary in hardness and density as well as in the tenacity of the bond be- tween the rock of the palettes and the glazed crust. Hawley (1947:75) noted, how- ever, that uniformity in individual crusts indicates that a mixture had been burned only once. Possibly the one use that produced the crust was cremation. Eight of the 11 palettes tested from the Swarts Ruin in southwestern New Mexico had coatings of lead mineral mixed with clay but had not been burned (Hawley 1947:73). Six palettes were found in inhumation burials at the Swarts Ruin, but none were found in either of the two cremations excavated (Hawley 1947:73). These unburned coatings containing lead mineral seem to indicate that the burning of the lead on palettes was incidental to cremation. Two pottery bowls and scoops from cremations also contain characteristic lead silicate crusts produced by burning the lead mineral (Hawley 1947:77). Four other pottery scoops found during general testing at Snaketown also contain the</page><page sequence="31">Paletas and Tabletas 351 same type of lead silicate incrustations, which raises the possibilty of burning of the lead in another context (Hawley 1947:77; Haury 1976:278). Further evidence of preparation of lead mineral in house or work areas is provided by a slab of rough, porous rock apparently used for preliminary grinding (Hawley 1947:75). Probably the lead mineral was a pigment. It also may have been used for magical effects because of the color changes and occasional appearance of pellets of lead during heating (Haury 1976:288). SNUFF TRAYS Snuff trays have been found associated with plant materials and snuff powder from archaeological sites in South America, but the identification of plants or ver- ification of the presence of alkaloids has been reported in only a few cases. Some leaves of Ilex guayusa found in the tomb of a "medicine man" at Nifio Korin were identified, and caffeine was successfully verified in these 1,500-year-old leaves by Professor Bo Holmstedt of The Karolinska Institute, Stockholm (Richard E. Schultes, letter of February 14, 1989; Holmstedt and Lindgren 1972:141). A leaf of Anadenanthera colubrina, or vilca, also was found in the same burial at Nifio Korin, indicating that the associated snuffing tube might have been used with the leguminous snuff (Wassen 1972:24). Tobacco also was identified from material found in a pouch at Nifio Korin (Wass6n 1972:43). Efforts to test archaeological samples of snuff powder for hallucinogens have so far been unsuccessful (Lautaro Nufiez, letter of November 29, 1988). According to Professor Richard E. Schultes of the Botanical Museum, Harvard University, some alkaloids deteriorate over time whereas others do not (letter of February 14, 1989). Mass spectrometry methods probably offer the best hope at the present time for testing archaeological materials for alkaloids. No evidence of preparation of snuff powder in the San Pedro de Atacama area is known. It is likely, however, that some snuff was prepared locally, and future excavation of living areas may produce evidence of this work (Constantino M. Torres, personal communication, 1988). Tree and plant sources for the hallucino- gens occur widely in South America, and some are present in the area where snuff trays are abundant in the Upper Rio Loa valley and around San Pedro de Atacama. Also, the San Pedro de Atacama area has been a crossroads and trading center from earliest times. Imported goods were available from the Pacific Coast, north- western Argentina, the Tihuanaco area in Bolivia, and the Amazon jungle. The hallucinogenic powders might have arrived already processed to be stored in cane or bone tube receptacles, then pulverized in the little mortars and spread on the tabletas to be inhaled (Berenguer 1984:14). Examination of four stone tabletas and other stone receptacles in the collec- tions at the Museo de Gustavo LePaige in San Pedro de Atacama found no crust or stains such as are common on the Hohokam palettes. These stone trays showed no</page><page sequence="32">352 LOWELL signs of fire. Significantly, perhaps, cremation was not practiced among the people of the San Pedro de Atacama culture. The importance of fire and smoke, including incense, in Hohokam cere- monies makes it interesting that "magic smoke" from tobacco cigars was used at ceremonial feasts in northwestern Brazil (Wassen 1965:74). The Tupi of eastern Brazil blew tobacco smoke from a tube in healing and magic ceremonies (Wassen 1967:273-274). It also should be noted that there is a parallel in the scarcity of pipes during the period of abundant palette use by the Hohokam (Haury 1945:193), with a similar scarcity of pipes from levels of San Pedro de Atacama II where snuff trays are abundant (Berenguer 1984:14; Agustin Llagostera, personal communication, 1988). CONCLUSION It appears probable that Hohokam stone palettes were an artifact associated with the use of hallucinogenic plant materials. The striking similarity in appear- ance between many Hohokam palettes and snuff trays from South America in- cludes parallels in details of size, form, and decorative techniques. Perhaps more significant is the occurrence among Hohokam cultural remains of a number of art- ifacts such as palettes, bone tubes of a particular type, effigy vessels, and small mortars and pestles that resemble utensils that comprise part of the inhalatory complex widely diffused in the New World. The close coincidence in time of most abundant palette use in North and South America also suggests a probable similar use of trays by the Hohokam. Native sources for narcotic plant materials in the southwestern United States are known. Snuffing of hallucinogenic materials in western Mexico would estabish this practice in an area with which Hohokam contacts have previously been suggested. It is interesting to note that along the desert coast of Peru and Chile snuff trays first appear together with the beginnings of agriculture and ceramics, the same horizon in which they are found in the southwestern United States. Differences such as the presence of lead mineral and greater emphasis on fire, smoke, and incense in Hohokam ceremonial custom involving palettes and asso- ciated artifacts may derive from the "weakening of the complex of transmitted ele- ments as a function of distance" during cultural diffusion (Haury 1976:226). Suggestions for further study include the testing of all utensils bearing the residue of contents by using new methods, such as mass spectrometry. Also, addi- tional study of provenience and association of utensils found with palettes and in caches of ceremonial materials as well as observations of signs of grinding, pul- verizing, or burning of the contents of these utensils would be useful in determin- ing possible relationships and use. In South America, testing of paint and residues on snuff trays and other utensils would be interesting. A new investigation of the stone palettes reported from the southeastern United States, particularly in Alabama, would be worthwhile (Hawley 1947:footnote 1,69).</page><page sequence="33">Paletas and Tabletas 353 Acknowledgments.
