<plain_text><page sequence="1">Krishna and Mithra as Messiahs by ELMER G. SUHR IN a previous article in this journal' I have attempted to show that many early peoples interpreted the solar eclipse as a dragon monster rising up from the earth to swallow the sun, a concept the artist incorporated in the mask. This does not mean, of course, that every dragon was exclusively an eclipse monster. Once the astro- nomer learned about the orbits of the sun and moon and the shadow of the latter projected to the earth during such an eclipse, the picture was changed to a composite animal, the unicorn,2 with a long tapering and grooved horn growing from the middle of his forehead; this animal has never been seen, so far as is known, by any civilized man. Since symbolism is cumulative throughout the ages, certain features of the early monster survived into the next stage: the painter of the Eleusis vase saw fit to use the face of the medusa but also added the cone-shaped shadow on the forehead;3 the painter of a black figured vase in the Louvre4 added the open- mouthed serpentine monster to the scene of the blinding of Polyphemos by Odysseus and his men; the stag horns of the early monster still cling to certain versions of the unicorn. Likewise, when we pass from the second to the third or messianic stage, some of the manifestations of the first stage still cling to the human figure: Moses and Siegfried have the horned skin of the old dragon, the serpent clings to the rock from which Mithra was born, and the unicorn of the second stage was long known as a symbol of the messiah; he is found in a scene of the crucified Christ.5 Let us now review the features of the sun, moon and shadow and their changes throughout the three stages of eclipse symbolism: the sun was presented as a disc between two outstretched wings or 1 Folklore, 76 (Io6C), D. oo-io-. 2 Ibid., 75 (1964), PP. 91-IO9. sIbid., 76 (io65).

The circle of light during the partial eclipse became a magic ring. The corona also found its way into the light behind the mask, the illumination of the dragon's body, the lamp of the shadow play, the head of the grail or cauldron and finally the head of the messiah. The moon with its translucent darkness was presented first as the mask or monster's face, then as a disc covered with a veil or screen which served as a filter for the sun's light in the sky as well as in the shadow play; it revealed the future in the book of fate on the knees of the gods. Later it became a round island or table and, in the messianic tradition, it issued forth as the forerunner or companion of the saviour. The shadow took on the form of a wedge, a sceptre, the grooved horn of the unicorn and perhaps the sword with its point directed downward. It could be the body of the monster on Shang bronzes, it passed under the name of a cloud or mountain or trumpet; it appeared in the guise of a tongue and thus became the Logos or avenue of communica- tion; eventually it played the role of the messiah's body. In its final manifestation it was saturated with both terror and loving kindness, it penetrated the earth, like Hermes, and walked on water, it became the great chain of being, the ladder of salvation, the son of the divine father. The messiah appears on the scene as a saviour of mankind in times of distress or despair, in response to a hope for supernatural deliverance from oppression or other evils6 which he is expected to overcome by superhuman or divine power, by his ability to provide healing and plenty. We are not concerned here with the upstart messiah who has turned out to be a questionable prophet to his own contemporaries but with one who has taken into the pattern of his life the manifestations of the solar eclipse. These mani- festations provide a pathway for the descent of divine favour and the regenerating ascent of suffering man. W. D. Wallis7 notes that supernatural manifestations of the solar eclipse herald the divinity of the messiah. These surviving solar attributes explain the profound impression the eclipse made on the mind of early man, when the monster took on the benevolent aspects of the moon 6 A.

For the most part, they were attached to an otherwise normal human being of superior ability some time after he passed from the scene; in some cases we have no evidence for his historical existence. The messiah is a figure who partakes of and is sustained by the light of the divine sun above, a light filtered through the lunar screen, but as a mortal being he is subject, in a measure, to human limitations. Among certain peoples he is regarded as a hero, while elsewhere he becomes the son of divinity, depending on the view- point of the people concerned. In a moral sense, which is usually applied in a later interpretation, he is a paragon of goodness despatched to mankind to deliver the latter from the bondage of evil or sin. Much again depends on the viewpoint of the people among whom he appears: if the divine source from which he traces his origin is potentially good or evil, his personality is not without an evil stain; if his divine father is perfect or absolute in his goodness, the messiah becomes an apostle of perfect goodness to his followers. In either case he attracts a great number of men who will thereby be brought into direct contact with the divine. The lunar shadow offered the basis for a symbolic identification of the human with the divine,8 and the resurrection of the sun from the jaws of the monster or disc of the moon gave an impetus to the redemption of man through the saving grace of an intercessor. Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, the sun god, who lives out a span of life on earth, carries along in his attributes and activity many features which can be favourably compared with the eclipse phenomenon. 'When Brahma had ended, the supreme lord plucked off two hairs, one white one and one black, and said to the gods: "These my hairs shall descend upon earth, and shall relieve her of the burden of her distress . . This my black hair shall be im- personated in the eighth conception of the wife of Vasudeva, Deraki-who is like a goddess-and shall slay Kamsa who is the demon Kilanemi." '9 The white and black hairs of lord Vishnu , The only writer, to my knowledge, who has attempted to interpret the connection of the unicorn with the messiah is N. McLeod, Epitome of the History of Japan, Nagasaki, I879, p. II6. He gives no reason for his statement, other than that the Chinese claim the unicorn is to come in the form of a great man who will reveal great mysteries to mankind. All this is a part of his theory to the effect that the lost tribes of Israel are somehow connected with Japan. See also O. Shepard, The Lore of the Unicorn, London, 1930, p. 96. 9 Vishnu Purana (Trans. H. H. Wilson), V, I. 207</page><page sequence="4">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS became Balarama and Krishna, two brothers in the same family, the former probably being the pale white light of the moon, the other the dark shadow. Balarama, the white brother, while he effects many wonders, serves mostly as a foil for the dark one who suppresses evil in favour of the divine on earth. When Krishna was born, he was 'Cloud-coloured, moon-faced, crown-wearing'; he was also 'yellow-silk girdled' and 'wearing the five-element necklace'.1' From this passage one can easily add to his figure the corona of the sun, the dark face of the moon and its shadow, the yellow of the horizon and the elements through which the shadow extends - all well known features of the solar eclipse we have previously discussed. The name of Krishna means 'the black, the dark, or the dark blue one'."1 He was also known as 'Ghanasyama' which means 'black like the rain cloud'.'2 Krishna faces in all directions, the sun and moon are his eyes, he is the light of the sun, the moon and the fire; as the column resting on the earth he supports many things above, as the moon he nourishes all herbs.13 He is a delight to man and the gods who frequently shower the earth with flowers when he appears as a hero. Krishna cannot be called exclusively the sun, the moon, the earth or the elements; his person wears a number of colours and extends from the sun and moon to the earth where he can become, like the makara, an agent for the fertility of vegetation. (The fertility feature is a sur- vival of the mask.) To use the words of Krishna himself, 'Know that glory (to be) mine which, dwelling in the sun', lights up the whole world, or in the moon or fire.'4 'I am... the beaming sun among the shining (bodies)... the moon among the lunar mansions.., .fire among the Vasus.'15 'As light, water, fire, earth and ether dwell in the body, so also is my splendour in every mortal frame."6 He owns the discus Sudarsan which produces the effulgence of myriads of suns and dispels the dense darkness.'7 He is the light of the world, but his body, extending downward to the earth, is in darkness; his head, however, combining the sun and moon, sheds the beauty 10 The Prema-Sigara (ed.

United with the sun he shares some of the attributes of Vishnu who props and holds fast the earth,18 has stepped out upon the earth,19 and passes through the three regions;20 Krishna, like his father, blows on his horn or conch shell, the sound of which fills his enemies with dismay, renews the vigour of the gods and destroys unrighteous- ness.21 Yet with all his connections with the sun and light, he is a god of the night. 22The strange combination of light and dark- which seems to be the hallmark of the messiah, is here pre- sented in its clearest outline of contrast; it sharpens the outline of a figure who comes from the light to deliver his faithful ones from the darkness. There are those who believe that Krishna may have been a historical figure23 who was, like Buddha, deified after his death (p. 50); Buddha, we know, was also reckoned as an avatar of Vishnu. If this is true of Krishna, it probably means that he was fitted into the pattern of the solar eclipse and its shadow by the priesthood of his votaries, that the redeeming features of the kirttimukha mask were recognized before Krishna was born. A. L. Basham24 informs us that Krishna was recognized as an avatar of Vishnu in Gupta times, that before this period he passed as a flute-playing divinity popular among herdsmen. What can we say, then about Balarama whom Basham (p. 306) calls a heavy drinker? Was he at one time a historical figure or was he a divinity of a different status before being associated with Krishna? Is he a heavy drinker because he is connected with the moisture-laden moon? Were all the associations with the solar eclipse attached to Krishna during the Gupta period? Did Krishna's dance with the milkmaids become circular at this time?25 Did the people of this time determine that around the dancing circle 'the sand was spread out like moonlight' ?26 1I Sacred Books of the East, XXVI, p. 130, 133. 19 Ibid., XLII, p. 200. 20 Ibid., XLII, p. 251. 21 Vishnu Purana, V, 21; W.

We are also told that every Gopi could claim him as a partner, and at the same time he stood in the centre of the circle with his favourite, Radha.27 This means that within the circle he was, in a sense, omnipresent, that in this sacred dance, which expresses the fertility connected with his presence, he pervaded everyone and everything, that his person here was not circumscribed by the limitations of a mortal being. Can we assume that this dance represents the circular shadow of the eclipse penetrating every section of its area ? Now let us consider the outstanding events in Krishna's bio- graphy: before his birth a prophecy proclaimed that he would destroy the Rakshasas or evil spirits. The ruler Kans, fearing for his own destruction because of his evil deeds, caused the children of Va- sudeva and Devaki to be put to death,28an eventwe can construe as a massacre of innocents. The foetus of both Krishna and his brother, however, were miraculously transferred to another woman, thus deceiving the king.29 Krishna was born at midnight, to the delight of the gods and the vegetation of the earth.30 He displayed his superiority of power over both Brahma and Indra, but his greatest feat was the conquest of the serpent or dragon Kaliya in a battle which finds him reduced, for a brief spell, to a helpless state; this conquest, which is only one of many, carries him into the water where the serpent has the advantage; we also note that Krishna does not annihilate the serpent.31 The whole horizon, we are told, was in a blaze from the heat of the monster. When Krishna was encompassed by the twining appendages, Balarama exhorted him to put off mortal man and reveal himself as a divinity, which means that he experienced a transfiguration. The females of the snake king then exclaimed: 'Thou art recognized, O god of gods!... Thou art light supreme, inscrutable; thou art the mighty lord, the portion of that supreme light .... Thyself, as an oviparous, hooded snake, art the upholder of the world.'32 Krishna, like 27 W. Crooke, Folklore, XI (19oo), p. 25. 28 For the massacre of the innocents see the Vishnu Purana V, 4. In many dragon tales a virgin must be offered to the monster at frequent intervals of time (J. A. Macculloch, The Childhood of Fiction, London, 1905, p. 382 f.). 9 The Prema-Sdgara, p. 20 f. 30 Ibid., p. 25; Vishnu Purana, V. 3. 31 Ibid. p. 50-3. He is also said to have made a descent into the lower world (N. Macnicol, JRAS (1913) p. 151). 32 Vishnu Parana, V, 7. 210</page><page sequence="7">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS' Siegfried, takes on certain features of the monster as a result of his contact with Kaliya; something of the monster also clings to Moses at the foot of Mount Sinai. Krishna steals the garments of the cowmaidens, an act which has been given a spiritual interpretation.33 On the road he displays his godhead in another transfiguration, having four arms and holding all the divine attributes he shares with his father Vishnu.34 Eventually he slays Kans, the epitome of evil in his life.35 As the charioteer of Arjuna he plays a major role in the conflict between the Pandavas and Kuravas and recites the Baghavad Gita to spur his friend on to battle. Finally his life is brought to an end by an arrow despatched to his heel, from the bow of a hunter who mis- takes him for a deer,36 an episode similar to that at the close of Achilles' life. At once he resumes his place among the gods above. He had descended as an emanation of the sun, he had lived his mortal life within the scope of the sun's power and finally received his death wound from the sun's ray creeping out from the edge of the moon and striking at the foot of the shadow on earth; whereupon he is reabsorbed into the sun and its light. The deer the hunter saw probably has some reference to the stag horns of the sun's corona. The messiah is generally accompanied or preceded by a com- panion of considerable stature who seems to be connected with the moon, a role probably filled here by Balarama; the latter is often likened to the moon37 - the moon that 'allayed the fervours of the sun, as discrimination alleviates the pain to which egotism gives birth'.38 Under the name of Balabhadra he was 'white as a jasmine, a swan, or the moon, and dressed in a blue raiment'.39 The gaming board, which belongs among the trappings of the moon and is a further development of the reticulated pattern, also figures in his life.40 He departs from this mortal existence in the form of a serpent, just prior to the wounding of Krishna. Krishna, whether a god, a demigod or superman, was not strictly a good character. He treated Brahma and Indra, both major divinities, with arrogant disrespect, luring their followers to his 3 The Prema-Sdgara, p. 58 f. 34 Ibid., p.

In this respect, however, we cannot be too demanding, for all the gods of the Hindu pantheon were not above taking unfair advantage of each other by the powers of their magic. Where all creatures and things are potentially good or evil, a good character, pure and undefiled, is a rarity. It must be admitted that he was a boon to his followers, that even when he inflicted harm, he left all concerned in a happy state. One more episode in his life must be stressed: in the latter part of his career Krishna and a great number of his followers repair to Kurukshetra, the site of the great battle between the Pandavas and Kuravas, to bathe and perform certain rites during the eclipse of the sun.41 We cannot regard this mention as a mere coincidence. It is very appropriate that here, where the conflict of the gods above against the evil demons was reflected through the lunar screen into the epic battle on earth, Krishna should pay his re- spects to divinity at a festival, that even the gods perform sacrifices on this site,42 that men born in this place fight in the van of the battle-line.43 On this site the beneficent influence of the eclipse is made manifest, for it was here that the miraculous cow Kamadhenu provided a bounteous meal for an army of men; it was also pro- claimed that if a virtuous act was performed here, it would bear fruit a thousand times; this act, however, must be performed during a solar eclipse.44 Krishna's identification with the lunar shadow is supported, then, by his outward appearance, by his transfigurations which recall the illuminated dragon, his destruc- tive power over monsters, his beneficent treatment of his followers and his connection with the city of the solar eclipse, Kurukshetra. The city of Kurukshetra was reckoned a sacred city both for gods and men. All human beings, generally speaking, must enter Yama's abode after death, but the inhabitants of the holy city by- pass his province and go direct to heaven.45 The great battle of the Mahabharata, which raged for eighteen days, also seems to have "l The Prema-Sdgara, p. 303 f. 42 Sacred Books of the Eas-t, XXVI, p. 275; XLIV, p. 441.

We add the fact that the name of Samvarana, the ancestor of the Kuravas, means the veiling around the sun.47 Krishna, fighting for the other side, is an avatar of the sun. It is also significant that, long before the battle, Yudhisthira is inveigled into a game of dice in which he loses everything, including Draupadi, to his opponent. The gaming board, a further develop- ment of the reticulated pattern, presents the means by which the sun gambles with the moon - and loses for the duration of the eclipse; in the end the sun and his followers triumph completely over their enemies. May we hazard the assumption, then, that the battle of Kurukshetra, like other manifestations connected with the messiah, reflects the conflict between the moon and the eclipsed sun? The latter is much like the solar lion who eventually chases the unicorn 'all around the town'. In an illustration for the Gita Govinda in the Melita Collection of Bombay48 we find an example of the benign effects of the eclipse. In the upper register of the painting are two trees in whose branches are blossoms and birds. Between the two trees is a large oval object whose entire surface is marked by a scaly pattern; on its right side is a disconsolate-looking bird, probably a peacock, whose head is turned backward to its tail, its feet projected help- lessly from the edge of the oval, as if it were in a weakened state and had lost its balance. This combination appears to be the bird of the sun caught in the coils of the serpentine dragon or the sun in eclipse. In the lower register are seven figures in a row against a dark background: Krishna making love to one female, Krishna dancing with another female and the same hero conversing with two others. The lunar screen, in this case, conforms more exactly to the surface of the monster's horned skin. The happy scene be- low is a reflection of the influence shed by the filtered light of the sun passing through the lunar screen. 46 Ibid., p. 24. 47 Ibid., p. 88. 48 W. G. Archer, The Loves of Krishna, London, 1957, P1. 22. 213</page><page sequence="10">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS Although the original status of Mithra was clouded over by the reforms of Zoroaster, his figure and career still preserve much that is characteristic of the solar eclipse and the messiah. Born with the light issuing from the rock vault of heaven, he first humiliated the sun, then crowned the same sun with resplendent rays, and henceforth the two remained united in all their projects. His main adventure concerns itself with a bull, an animal which may have been borrowed from the Mesopotamians or the cult of the Great Mother of Phrygia. Mithra dragged the bull, whose home was in a cave of the earth, back to its shelter but was unable at the time to master it. In a second struggle, meeting with greater success, he plunged the dagger into the side of the creature from whose body grew the vegetation of the earth, including the vine. By this act Mithra became the creator of all living beings and was charged with protecting them from harm at the hands of evil demons. After the celebration of a Last Supper with his con- federates (including the sun), he took up his residence with the immortals above whence he had come and where he continued to watch over his devotees below. The god of light, definitely related to the earlier Mitra, served as a connecting link, the LEl-rqs, lord of the middle region; as Plutarch states it, he took his stand, mid- way between light and darkness.49 We are told that 'Mithra' means, in sanscrit, friendship, in Avestan, a compact.50 After being eclipsed by the Zoroastrian reforms he eventually became a respectable member of a divine triad during the reign of Artaxerxes Memnon (404-358 B.C.), after which his popularity grew and still later spread throughout the Roman empire. Of importance to us is the fact that he has two aspects, one of light, the other of darkness, one of good and one of evil; the Magians stressed only the good side." When he was born he wore the Phrygian cap on his head, holding a torch in the left hand, a dagger in the right;52 in the case of this mediator the 49 De Is. et Os., 46. 50 J. H. Moulton, Early Zoroastrianism, London, 1913, p. 63; H. S. Nyberg, Die Religionen des alten Iran, MVAG, XLIII (1938), p. 6o. 5x Moulton, ibid., p. 139-4o. He was even implicated in a fraud (p. 149). Cf. J. Leipoldt et al: Religionsgeschichte des Orients in der Zeit der Weltreligionen, Leiden, 1961, p. 45. We also read (p. 76) that 'Mithra war kein sterbender und auferstehender Gott, wenn er auch als Heilbringer auftrat'. 62 F. Cumont, The Mysteries of Mithra, Chicago, 191o, fig. 30. In fig. 31 he holds a bunch of grapes in his right hand; the dagger lies on the rock at his left. 214</page><page sequence="11">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS suggestion that the dagger or short sword is a symbol of the lunar shadow becomes more insistent, for it is this instrument which brings fertility, by way of the bull, to the earth. The bull of Mithra is a cave-dweller, and when he is slain by the god of light, his rich blood calls forth vegetation. Cumont53 furnishes a drawing of this episode, taken from a marble group in the British Museum, where, instead of blood, three heads of grain come forth from the wound; elsewhere the same fertility sign appears at the end of the tail. Again we have a parallel with the makara from whose mouth the plant sprouts forth. The blood of the bull, which falls on the mystic in Mithraic rites, likewise has the effect of regeneration, of re- storing the initiate to the realm of light. Nothing is mentioned about Mithra's death as a mortal being, perhaps because he was originally derived from a divine source. While we may say his symbolism can include the light and darkness of day and night, there is plenty of evidence for the lunar shadow as a mediator in his history. Much of the spiritual and allegorical significance covering the career of the Persian Messiah can be traced back, as in other cases, to a more concrete phenomenon in human experience. When we are told that Mithra was a mediator between heaven and earth, we are not to believe that this connection is a mere figure of speech. His connection with the mediating lunar shadow is clear from the representation of his birth. We quote Cumont: 'La roche elle- meme qui l'avait mis au monde, etait consider6e comme divine, on l'adorait dans les temples sous la forme d'une stble conique, sorte de betyle analogue a ceux veneres en Syrie.'54 There is no reason to question this statement which implies that Mithra proceeded from some cone-shaped phenomenon, and what is a more probable analogue than the lunar shadow? The mention of the rock from which he was born is still somewhat of a puzzle for which we can only offer conjectures: we know that certain primitives thought of the vault of heaven as made of stone, and it is common knowledge that the medusa, the eclipse mask, transformed everything before its face into stone, that if the sun's rays fell on a Norse giant, he was turned to stone, but the basic reason for the birth from stone 's Ibid., fig.

We can hardly question, however, the prototype from which the rocky cone was derived. On the monuments, either in relief or in the round, we find the figure of a child - a Phrygian cap on his head, one hand holding a torch, the other a dagger - carved down to the waist above a mass of rock. Sometimes the shape of the latter is indeterminate, occasionally it is rectangular and at times it is definitely conical: on a bas-relief from Schwadorf, in lower Austria, now in Vienna, a young man rises from a cylindrical rock.55 Another example shows a rock with the same markings we find on the dragon's body.56 Still more intriguing is the child whose lower legs are still embedded in the cone; a serpent rising from below twines its body around the rock and a portion of the body.57 The rock from which Mithra was born is the original mediator, the aniconic version of the messiah. The child rising from the cone is the only presentation where the transition from the amorphous geometric to the anthropomorphic, from the lunar shadow to the messianic person is clearly portrayed. In the birth of other messiahs the transition is implied in other information but not presented concretely. An association with the eclipse was already expressed by an ancient writer.68 The birth from stone can possibly be understood in the light of hylozoistic matter the ancient had in mind, for fire comes forth from the rock at Mithra's birth. Like the theory of the early alchemist the important aspect lay in the qualities of a substance which may be concealed beneath the surface unless brought to light by the proper agent. The fact that sparks of fire could be flashed from flint59 persuaded the primitive that stone, far from being the hard dead weight of our view, contained both light and fire, qualities akin to those of the sun. Phaunos, the son of Circe, placed a sprig between two stones; he then rubbed them back and forth until he drew forth the fire hidden in the stones.60 5 Ibid., II, p. 334, mon. 231; inscription 384, p. 148. s Ibid., II, p. 367, mon. 25IL, fig. 254. For another example of the cone see II, p. 205, mon. I9c, fig. 32. 57 Ibid., II, p. 498, suppl. 228bis, fig. 435; another is somewhat similar (II, p. 320, mon. 2Io, fig. 183). The serpent's head is placed directly in front of the body. 68 Ibid., I, p. 199; II, p. 48. The explanation of Statius is not very satisfying. See also the conical rock (II, fig. 178). 69 M. J. Vermaseren, Mithras, the Secret God, London, 1963, p. 76. 60 Nonnus XXXVII, 61-9. 216</page><page sequence="13">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS As we have pointed out, the lunar shadow producing the messianic Mithra presents both the aniconic and anthropomorphic versions of the same being; later the figure of Mithra uses the shadow as an attribute or weapon, much as Hermes employs the caduceus from which he arose. The conical stone, then, has as much light and fire as the sun-saturated shadow and the trans- figured messiah. The serpent circling around the cone and body of the young Mithra is simply a survival of the earliest stage in solar eclipse symbolism, before the astronomer learned about the lunar shadow and its shape. Cumont (I, p. 200) comments that it is embarrassing to the learned to realize that Mithra is and at the same time is not the sun; he is often pictured as the god of light but also stands over against the sun as he adds or removes the rays from his head. All this becomes clear when we realize that the shadow is not the sun itself but still partakes of its light and richness. On a series of reliefs6' we find Mithra at one moment chastising the sun and then later being reconciled to him, replacing the rays on his head, all of which is necessary if the sun is to pass through the ordeal of dark- ness to renewed light, from death to regeneration. The instrument he uses against the sun is the lunar shadow from which he issued at birth; Vermaseren62 is right when he states that it looks in some cases like a pointed cap or a drinking horn, then in other cases like a piece of meat, 'either a shoulder or a leg'. We can favourably compare fig. 30 of Vermaseren with the object held by the hairy monster on a silver bowl from the Bernardini tomb.63 Perhaps we can substitute for the 'shoulder or leg' the cauldron-like com- bination of sun and moon above the shadow. Once the sun has passed through the ordeal of the shadow, both he and Mithra have good reason for mutual congratulations. The same episode was illustrated at Dura-Europos64: here we note that the radiate crown above the head of Sol has a more dense rim of darkness than elsewhere. After slaying the bull, the cosmos with its flora and fauna is 61 Cumont: op. cit. (supra no. 54), II, fig. 213. Mithra (c5) is about to strike the sun with a conical object which Cumont (p. 338) likens to an 'outre a moiti6 degonfl6'. It could also be Mithra's aniconic image. 62 Op. cit.

XVIII, i. 217</page><page sequence="14">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS created and man is also brought into being. So far as we know, Mithra has no forerunner, no companion associated with water or the moon. Like Moses with his rod at the rock of Horeb, he shoots an arrow at a rock to bring forth water.65 He saves his followers from the ravages of flood and fire. After the Last Supper and his ascension he continues to watch over and intercede for the devout from his position on high. Mithra is, then, a mediator in more than one sense: he joins the sun to the earth, he functions, both on earth and in the beyond as a saviour for mankind; he speaks to and for man in the capacity of the Logos; he is a demiurge of the cosmos, where his followers are initiated into his rites. Around his altar conical stones were placed and held in high respect. Needless to say, there are a great number of parallels between his career, his attributes, his rites and those of the Christians. At Baalbek in Syria a flourishing cult centred around three divinities during the first and second centuries A.D. of the Roman empire. The gods included Venus, Jupiter and Mercury. The first two had assimilated a number of attributes of more local Syrian divinities, Jupiter being closely identified with Adad and Venus with Atargatis, while Mercury played the very appropriate role of mediator between heaven and earth, the gods and mankind. The animal symbolism attached to each one of these gods is not so easily understood, because the monuments on which they are figured are badly mutilated, but Seyrig66 believes the bulls belong to Jupiter, the Tritons to Venus and the lions to Mercury. More- over, since the sphere of each one seems to overlap those of the others, the sculptor has sometimes added to the figure of one god something of the symbolism of the others, which renders the distinctive meaning of each divinity rather confusing. So far as one can discern, Jupiter is the cosmic god of the sky, Venus, remini- scent of the heavenly Aphrodite, is mistress of the waters of the earth, but how far beyond the earth she extends her sway it is hard to say; Mercury, in a sense the most important member of the triad, has taken over control of the sun and something more that connects the sun with the earth. Jupiter, whose role was more prominent during the centuries before Christ, was later confined to the planetary regions above the sun. 65 Ibid., p. Io6, P1. XVIII, I. Cf. Exodus XVII, 6. 6 Syria, X, 1929, P. 335. 218</page><page sequence="15">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS Why did Mercury become so prominent as a mediator? The caduceus of the Greek Hermes was nothing more than a diminutive cosmic column, the early aniconic form of the god, which expressed his chief role as an agent of communication between the upper and lower regions. As one who entered Hades in the role of psycho- pompos he has his dark side. The prototype for this picture was no doubt the lunar shadow which served as one form of the cosmic column and which apparently penetrated the dark regions of the earth. With the sun at the summit of the column it is easy to understand how Mercury took over the control of this body. The souls of men are now pictured as bits of flame the sun despatches into corporate form on earth and later draws back to himself at the appointed time.67 Here we find an illustration of something we found less clearly presented in the shadow theatre: the heroes descend from on high as emanations of the sun to play a stellar role for the benefit of man on earth and then later return to their rightful home. All this takes place through the medium of the stage screen or the lunar shadow. At Baalbek Mercury, resuming his old control of the shadow, facilitates the passing to and fro of the children of the sun. The solar eclipse provided the paradigm and impetus to such a connection between god the father and his children by way of the messiah, Mercury and the sun being so closely identified they were sometimes considered as one. The figure of Dionysus, to whom the small temple was dedicated, furnished an appropriate complement to the triad: from the standpoint of fertility he brings the increase of plant life we have found in the makara and the wounding of the Mithraic bull; on the plane of mysticism he is a decided asset to the salvation and rebirth of the human soul. Seyrig68 illustrates a number of votive tablets which present the role of Mercury in the solar eclipse as well as in the Baalbek triad. 67 Ibid, p. 341. A similar doctrine was advocated by the Gnostics (Jean Doresse, The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics, New York, 196o, p. 19). The Christian Holy Ghost descended in the form of fiery tongues (St John Damascene, Barlaam and Joasaph, I, 4; Anthropos, LIV, 1959, p. 41o; cf. Vergil; Aeneid VI, 730-51 ; also the parallel drawn between the influence of the sun passing through mirrors and the passing of the Holy Spirit through Mary to the child Christ (F. A. Yayes, JWarb XVII (1954), p. 152, P1. I7a). As fire raises air to a nobler state so human nature is exalted by the penetration of the divine. 68 Loc. cit., P1. LXXXVI; Berytus, XIV, 1961, P1.

I83, fig. 12. 219</page><page sequence="16">KRISHNA AND MITHRA AS MESSIAHS Between one or more frames we find the sun disc covered with the reticulated pattern of the lunar screen, crowned with the head of Mercury himself; the base tends to be cone-shaped.69 Let us look more closely at number four (Berytus, Pl. XVI): here we observe not only the netting but, on the edge of the disc and outside the netting, also the rays of the sun shooting forth. The netting of the screen, we repeat, signifies the darkness70 of the moon through which the subdued light of the sun passes, the darkness of the solar eclipse when communication between the sun and earth is made easier, when the shadow, as the mediating saviour, brings the blessings of the sun to mankind. The monster on Shang vessels also carries this pattern.7" The head of the young man, which can hardly be that of Jupiter, presents Mercury as lord of the sun and the shadow covering the disc. The roles of a dual being, the father and the son united in one, are summed up succinctly and effec- tively.72 An Assyrian seal cylinder in the collection of Hans Silvius von Aulock73 brings us an object of nearly the same shape, slightly more oval than round, with the same reticulated pattern covering the surface, the whole resting on a cone-shaped stand or handle. Rays of light project from the oval, around the whole circum- ference. On each side there are two horned animals and between each pair a tree. The main difference between the Baalbek offering and the seal is the boot-strap or plant motive on the latter; the head is also absent from the seal. Von der Osten calls the object a tree of life to which I find no trace of resemblance. J. Moulton74 69 On an Attic coin the three Graces stand on a platform supported by a cone- shaped handle (JWarb, XV (1952), Pl. 4d). Below the handle is a ball within a lunar crescent. 70 C.

Fonten- rose, Python, Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, 1959, fig. i8. 72 The solar cult was also taken over by the Roman emperors, especially Aurelian (J. Kennedy, JRAS (1917), p. 396). During the first part of his reign Constantine derived his divine power from Sol Invictus who granted him victory and good fortune. After his conversion Christ took the place of Sol Invictus (Folklore 66 (1955), p. 411). See also F. Cumont, op. cit. (supra no. 54), I, p. 344. 73 H.
