Cox (New York, Cambridge University Press, I987) 187 pp. $32.50 Today's transatlantic observer might notice something American about early nineteenth-century British politics. A member of parliament (MP) behaved like a congressman. His support was firmly grounded in the shires and boroughs. The control and financing of local elections were more or less in his hands, and he was consulted by the government on ,he distribution of patronage. Every MP, therefore, was a potential backbencher, dissident, and independent. The most significant recog- nition of his influence at Westminster was the understanding that parlia- ment legislated whereas government-the ministers of the Crown- merely administered. By the end of the nineteenth century, certainly by the end of the Edwardian era, the individual MP was no longer independent and hardly ever dissident. The constitution had changed dramatically. A trans- atlantic observer would need assistance. For a start, he would have to consult Bagehot's celebrated (and cynical) 865 account of the "efficient secret," the exercise of both executive and legislative authority by a committee commonly called a "cabinet," its members drawn from par- liament.1 He would then have to learn about the theory and practice of political parties, since the cabinet itself seemed to be preoccupied with "external" institutions that were well-financed, ubiquitous, and omni- potent. What had happened? With wit, precision, and tireless clarity, Cox weighs each of the variables that could account for such a major transformation in the English constitution. Was it the cabinet that gradually took power from individual MPs and "whipped" them into modern shape? Was it the rise of party that curtailed the authority of MPs? Was it the passage of the (Secret) Ballot Act in 1872 or the Corrupt Practices Act in 1883 that destroyed the hold that MPs had long exercised over their constituencies? Or was it the enormous increase in the amount and complexity of legislative activity, driven by a dynamic economy, that shifted power from MPs to ministers and civil servants? Each one of these questions raises a series of others, which Cox carefully pursues. He consults the usual authorities, extracts the essential fact or clue, tests each hypothesis against data new and old, and pushes relentlessly on to find the answer through sustained and exemplary empirical analysis. The answer to his largest question depends less upon the "rise" of the cabinet than upon the "decline" of the independent MP. His reign ended in I868, or just after passage of the Second Reform Bill, but his authority had started to erode in the I83os, the i84os, and the I850s- in other words, well before the cabinet had acquired its pre-eminent I Walter Bagehot, The English Constitution (London, 1867; orig.

As for the increase in parliamentary business, Cox demonstrates that additional business actually led to higher participation rates by MPs, but without a corresponding increase in political authority. What produced the decline of the private member, leading to a necessary expansion in the powers of the cabinet? Cox shifts the argu- ment to the electorate itself, twice enlarged by reform acts and made still larger by the increase in wealth that enfranchised new voters under the property qualifications of the Act of 1832. In his account, the Act of 1832 once again deserves to be called "The Great Reform Bill." Whatever its intentions and immediate consequences, the long-run ef- fects of the Act were fundamental. Redistricting and the increase in voters led to major changes in campaigning. Voting was less predictable. Eventually the press of legislative activity became a factor, as the old eighteenth-century cry of "men not measures" gave way to the nine- teenth-century need for measures as much as men. But "measures" are national not local, and where national interests are primary, centraliza- tion of legislative initiative occurs. The cabinet had to lead the nation, but the cabinet, unlike MPs, could be coerced only indirectly. All of the evidence that Cox has marshaled indicates growing electoral preference for party labels and party loyalty as effective methods for channeling public opinion. Whereas the traditional argument asserts that party im- posed itself upon the electorate, Cox explains exactly how the electorate took the initiative and "chose" the party to discipline the cabinet and parliament. Cox writes for two groups of scholars, political scientists and his- torians. Some of the former, as well as a few of the latter, will be comfortable with the statistical methods and modeling techniques that he employs. Political historians will generally understand the methods used to measure split voting and plumping, since these have been in the literature for some time, but "agreement analysis," "perfect-informa- tion," and "cue-taking" models will be less well known. Historians who rely on qualitative arguments will concentrate their attention on different sources of evidence and argument. They will want to have a fuller appreciation of the functioning of patronage at lower levels, querying whether individual MPs in earlier decades had as much independence in local constituencies as Cox's model requires. They will also wonder whether ideological questions should be so completely subordinated to structural factors and will want to know the extent to which the political players were aware of short- and long-run changes in electoral practice, since their perceptions may have shaped political behavior. Historians will need to incorporate evidence about the redistribution of population in county, city, and suburb, changing income levels, and the growth of trade unions. However, it would be awkward to fault Cox on omissions.</page><page sequence="3">322 MARY ELLA FEINLEIB Although he is aware of virtually all of the requisite variables, he also recognizes, like the MPs he discusses, that there is never enough time for talking and debate. This is a tight, elegant, and superior piece of reasoning. Sheldon Rothblatt University of California, Berkeley The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age. By Harriet Ritvo (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, I987) 347 pp. $25.00 Readers of nineteenth-century natural histories will recognize the Vic- torian moral continuum between humans and other animals that pro- vides the central theme for Ritvo's provocative book. Every manner of beast was endowed with anthropomorphic traits, while unfamiliar va- rieties of humans (lower classes and foreigners) were relegated to a moral level at or below that of the favored quadrupeds. According to Ritvo, the attitudes of middle- and upper-class Victorians toward the animals that they kept as pets, raised on farms, or displayed in zoos symbolized their attitudes toward other classes of humans in their hierarchical so- ciety, and served to reinforce that hierarchy. There is much here to instruct and delight the reader. Ritvo provides a sophisticated, gracefully written account of the multiple roles played by four-footed animals in Victorian England; her narrative is enhanced by nineteenth-century illustrations, many of them amusing to twentieth- century viewers. At its most effective, the book presents sufficient lit- erary evidence to make a compelling case for the symbolic function of animals in Victorian society, as in the chapters on cattle breeding and dog fancying. Aristocratic landowners of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries enthusiastically took up animal husbandry, with the ostensible aim of improving the breeding stock to produce more meat for Britain. They established clubs to sponsor shows of their prize cattle; they com- piled volumes of bovine genealogy that rivaled Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage. The parallel between the four-footed animal and its two- footed owner is unmistakable. "For both animals and people a distin- guished lineage divided those with hereditary claims to high status from arrivistes" (6I). Ironically, these elite breeders had little influence on agricultural production, because they were the only ones who could afford to raise cattle to their own specifications. Moreover, since the principal specifications were massive size and racial purity, the prize cattle were too fat, too clumsy, and too inbred to breed well. Social aspiration is similarly seen as the motive behind the Victorian passion for breeding pet dogs. Ritvo cites descriptive evidence from breeders' handbooks and periodicals to demonstrate that the urban mid-</page></plain_text>
