<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT: POSTMODERN TRANSFORMATIONS OF MARCEL MAUSS' THEORY Carl Olson Marcel Mauss' study of the gft is generally considered a classic work in the field of religious studies and in the discipline of anthropology. This exemplary paradigm of scholarship, however, is not given the same respect and acceptance by some postmodern thinkers because it fails to address in part the significance of difference. After reviewing the major highlights of Mauss' theory and the insights ofJacques Derrida and George Bataille on the phenomenon of the gft, these theories will be placed within the context of theoretical work on the Hindu notion of the gift in order to test their reflections about the nature of the gift within the context of a particular tradition. Finally, some aspects of the work of Bataille and Derrida will be compared with Mauss in order to demonstrate some of the problems with the respective positions of each side and briefly to compare some aspects of their respective positions on such issues as time, presence, and rationality. Although it is unusual for a book to be so widely revered among a scholarly audience for any length of time, the work entitled Essai sur le don forme et raison de l'échange dans les sociétés archaïques by Marcel Mauss first published in L'Année sociologique in 1924 and republished in 1950 by the Presses Universitaires de France is a study that is generally considered a classic in anthropology and religious studies. This exemplary paradigm of scholarship is not given, however, the same respect and acceptance by some postmodern thinkers because it fails to address in part the significance of difference. Two of the best examples of such critics of Mauss' theory of the gift are Jacques Derrida and George Bataille. Within the context of discussing the philosophy of Martin Heideg ger, Derrida thinks that the German philosopher elucidates that giv ing (Geben) and the gift (Gabe) lack any ontological status because it is impossible to think of them in terms of Being: "Because they consti tute the process of propriation, the giving and the gift can be construed neither in the boundaries of Being's horizon nor from the vantage point of its truth, its meaning" (Derrida 1979: 121). Since they amount to nothing without a subject being or an object being, Derrida concludes that the gift or giving does not possess any essence. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2002 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 14, 350-374</page><page sequence="2">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 351 He also playfully claims that "to give" does not involve exchange. In fact, a pure gift is without exchange, without return (1986: 243). Derrida's deconstruction of the notion of gift necessarily implies that there is no need for any party to feel any obligation toward the other, a position in sharp contrast to that of Emmanuel Levinas and his emphasis on obligation. Having nothing to do with Being, a thing, an act, exchange, or an obligation, the gift is more akin to an excess that overflows language. The excessive nature of the gift is especially emphasized by Georges Bataille, who is fascinated by the practice of the potlatch among tribal societies. If Mauss perceives a necessity for a harmonious reciprocity among parties in the act of exchanging gifts, Bataille's emphasis on the excessive nature of the potlatch, a unilateral gesture of expenditure (dépensej, allows him to stress its disruptive nature and undermines the homogeneity implied by the evidence used by Mauss. Bataille calls into question Mauss' theory of the gift by utilizing a modified version of the potlatch for the general economy, undermining Mauss' view of a gift-exchange without loss or gain. Not only does the potlatch disrupt the established social-economic order, it also enables us to encounter death, which is symbolized by the dramatic destruction of goods. The ultimate form of expenditure for Bataille, however, is eroticism, an ambiguous social phenomena connected to a vacillation between at traction and repulsion (Olson 1994). Before we develop further some of the insights of Derrida and Bataille on the nature of the gift, it will be useful to review some of the major highlights of Mauss' classic theory of the gift to better grasp more accurately the position to which the postmodern thinkers are reacting. After examining the positions of Bataille and Derrida on the phenomenon of the gift, we will place their theories within the con text of theoretical work completed on the Hindu notion of the gift in order to test their reflections about the nature of the gift within the context of a particular tradition and to discern any insights that they might offer when reconsidering the Hindu notion of the gift. This approach is suggested by the work of Mauss because of the central role played by the Hindu conception of the gift in his work, even though Parry indicates that the role of the Hindu understanding of the nature of the gift is inconsistent with the basic thesis of Mauss (Parry 1986: 455). Finally, some aspects of the work of Bataille and Derrida will be compared with Mauss in order to demonstrate some of the problems associated with the respective positions of each side</page><page sequence="3">352 CARL OLSON and to briefly compare some aspects of their respective positions with respect to such issues as time, presence, and rationality. Gift and obligation From the scholarly perspective of Mauss, a gift can be any object or service that possesses a uniqueness, that is given within a web of social interrelationships, which suggests that a gift is more pervasive than simply a present, because it can include labor. It is rare for a present to assume the form of labor. Mauss' theory of the gift concen trates more on circulation and consumption and not on productive consumption and consumptive production as does Marxian theory (Lojkine 1989; Lévi-Strauss 1966; Cazeneuve 1968; Leacock 1954). Mauss wants to identify the social significance of a gift and what gift exchanges inform us about people doing the giving and receiving, the objects given and received, and what this practice tells us about social relations within a given context. The uniqueness of a gift is related to the people involved in an exchange and the precise moment of the exchange, whereas a commodity type of relationship is characterized by the lack of an enduring connection between the people and object in a more alienated and fungible type of relationship. It is possible to summarize the uniqueness of the gift in this way: "In gift relations people are thought of or identified in terms of their fundamental, inalienable attributes and relationships, and hence are unique" (Car rier 1991: 127). This does not necessarily mean that gifts, which are inalienable objects, and commodities are exclusive categories because there are gift transactions that embody elements of alienation and individualism (Carrier 1991: 132). It is possible for a utilitarian or superfluous gift to be a commodity, although Mauss' use of the term "gift" does not specifically identify the exact object or service ex changed. According to Mauss, the giving of a present to someone is not a voluntary action because any gift involves obligation and economic self-interest. A person gives to another person because one is obli gated to act in this way, and the person receiving a gift is then involuntarily obligated to return the gift. The obligations of this fun damental exchange system are imposed upon both parties by social groups and not by the individuals themselves (Mauss 1990: 5; 1966: 150). The obligatory nature of gift transactions are dissimilar to those</page><page sequence="4">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 353 of buying and selling in which a buyer is only obligated to pay for what is purchased from the seller, a transaction that terminates any further obligation or relationship. The obligatory nature of the gift does not mean for Mauss that a gift is never free; it does, however, suggest that by fulfilling the obligation to give it is recreated by the reaffirmation of the social relationships of which the obligation is a part from the commencement of the exchange (Carrier 1991: 124). Mauss conceives of the process of exchange in a rather broad way because the exchange goes beyond mere economic goods; it includes social acts of politeness—conceived in a liberal way—that encompass such activities as rituals, dances, festivals, banquets, military services, and can even involve the exchange of women and children, which represents an example of Mauss' tendency to place greater stress on a more active role for humanity in social phenomena than his mentor Durkheim (Allen 1985: 28). Mauss does, however, draw a distinction between gift exchange, which is associated with tribal cultures domi nated by kinship and group relations, and commodity exchange, which is evident in industrial types of societies that are characterized by social class and division of labor in which self-interest, independ ence of both giver and recipient, and frequent impersonal relation ships predominate. When a person presents a gift to someone else that person is not merely giving some inert or neutral object but is, rather, giving an active part of oneself, which suggests that a gift is inalienably con nected to the giver. Mauss is suggesting that a gift is something per sonal and alive with a special power that not only generates itself, but also possesses the power to renew the relationship between the giving and receiving parties. The recipient of the gift receives something very special: "one must give back to another person what is really part and parcel of his nature and substance, because to accept some thing from somebody is to accept some part of his spiritual essence, of his soul" (Mauss 1990: 12; 1966: 161). Thus, the gift possesses a vitality, which often includes individuality for Mauss. By giving part of oneself in the gift, a person not only participates in it, but this also creates a lasting spiritual bond between persons. Throughout his theory Mauss emphasizes the importance of obli gation, which, he stresses, is threefold: to give, to receive, and to reciprocate. The threefold sequence of obligation forms a never-end ing cycle of exchange, a cycle that suggests an orderly system. Whether the receiver is a large social group, a small group, or a lone</page><page sequence="5">354 CARL OLSON individual, they are all obligated to receive. The group or individual with whom they enter into an exchange relationship is in turn obli gated to give, an obligation that can have dire consequences if it is not fulfilled by the group or person. The potentially serious political and social consequences of meeting the demands of the obligation to give are lucidly made by Mauss: "To refuse to give, to fail to invite, just as to refuse to accept, is tantamount to declaring war; it is to reject the bond of alliance and commonality. Also, one gives because one is compelled to do so, because the recipient possesses some kind of right of property over anything that belongs to the donor" (1990: 13; 1966: 1162-1163). And upon receiving a gift one is under pres sure to reciprocate in order to complete the cycle of giving, which then continues in the cycle of exchange. This cycle of giving forms a structure that constrains both the giver and the recipient because of the obligations imposed on both parties. Moreover, the cycle of ex change suggests the binding effect of the gift by linking different kinship groups. The binding effect of the gift is destroyed, for in stance, when a recipient rejects the gift because one is also rejecting the social relationship enhanced and reinforced by the gift and the giver's concern for the recipient. In other words, the gift, unlike an impersonal commodity, for Mauss is too personal and very integral to the identity of the giver for someone to just reject it. Two other features of the gift identified for their importance by Mauss are ownership and certainty. The former feature means that when one receives a gift one necessarily gains ownership over it and not merely possesses it (1990: 22-23; 1966: 180). As gifts circulate in certain tribal societies (Mauss refers to Melanesian and Polynesian groups in his classic work), they create certainty that they will eventu ally be reciprocated, a feature that Mauss finds within the gift itself (1990: 35; 1966: 199). These two features of a gift emphasize the obligatory and economic self-interest aspects of the nature of the gift. According to one authority, the core of Mauss' model is represented by the distinction between gifts and commodities, a dual distinction that can be applied to the social identity of objects, to types of trans actions between parties, and to kinds of societies. This type of catego rization leads Mauss to distinguish between what he calls gift societies (e.g., Melanesian societies) and commodity systems (e.g., Western societies). In the former type of society the gift influences all aspects of social life, whereas in the latter type of society it is alienation that is prevalent. This type of distinction is an example of the occi</page><page sequence="6">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 355 dentalism of Mauss that is connected to his orientalism (Carrier 1995: 86-87). The dynamic nature of the gift is evident in the phenomenon of the potlatch, a kind of orgy of generosity in some tribal societies. This system of gift exchange can become violent, exaggerated, and an tagonistic, features that have special appeal to someone like Bataille. The effect that is produced by a potlatch is all encompassing from the perspective of Mauss: "In certain kinds of potlatch one must expend all that one has, keeping nothing back. It is a competition to see who is the richest and also the most madly extravagant. Every thing is based upon the principles of antagonism and rivalry" (1990: 37; 1966: 200). This competition revolves around honor and prestige for the participants in a reciprocal pattern that creates obligations among the parties. The competitive nature of the potlatch is similar to a game that one risks losing. If one loses within the context of the potlatch, one loses social rank and status and even one's persona. It is the obligation to reciprocate that Mauss identifies as the essence of the potlatch (1990: 41; 1990: 208). And the destructive quality of the giving resembles a sacrifice. The potlatch is structured and constrained by obligation because no one can refuse to participate or refuse to be a recipient of a gift, which is indicative of the burden that accompanies any gift. If one refuses to participate, this is indicative of one's fear of having to reciprocate and losing in the exchange, a dramatic proof that one is unequal to the giver and unable to meet the challenge offered by the gift. It is very easy to be captured by the power of the items ex changed, a power that causes the things exchanged to be circulated, given, and returned. During the potlatch, the power inherent within the things exchanged becomes manifested: "Each one of these pre cious things possesses, moreover, productive power itself. It is not a mere sign and pledge; it is also a sign and a pledge of wealth, the magical and religious symbol of rank and plenty" (1991: 44; 1966: 220-221). Excessiveness of the gift If Mauss wants to strip the irrational from the notion of gift and emphasize its harmonious reciprocity, Bataille thinks that the potlatch disrupts the homogeneity of Mauss' theory and dramatically</page><page sequence="7">356 CARL OLSON magnifies the difference between his notion of dépense and the don of Mauss' theory. Unlike Mauss, Bataille wants to examine the irra tional, disruptive, destructive, and excessive aspects of the gift. The examination of these types of features enables Bataille also to stress its powerful, paradoxical, absurd, and erotic aspects. In order to accom plish his objective, Bataille examines the potlatch of the American Indians of the northwest (e.g., Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and Kwakiutl tribes) in which he finds a circulation of wealth without bargaining. Within these tribal cultures, the giver challenges, humili ates, and obligates the receiver, who must in turn respond to erase the humiliation, assume the challenge, and satisfy the obligation cre ated by accepting the excessive gift. Within this context, the demand for dépense originates from within the person, although it cannot be asserted that there is a reason for it other than the desire a person may possess for it (Bataille 1970-1988: 7.16). Alluding to Mauss' theory and the phenomenon of the potlatch, Bataille agrees that the act of giving represents the acquisition of a power. In fact, the giver surpasses oneself in the act of gift giving because one acquires a power, which is connected with contempt for the riches that one gives away. Thus, there is a relationship between power, a surpassing virtue of gift giving, and renunciation, a feature that Bataille identifies with the essence of the gift that he specifies as "the prohibition of immediate, unreserved, animal gratification" (1991: 56). The power closely associated with the gift is interrelated with the paradoxical nature of the gift because the gift becomes reduced for Bataille to the acquisition of power. There is no power, however, associated with the gift if one's act is done in silence or solitude. The excessive giving must be done in a public manner: "But if he destroys the object in front of another person or if he gives it away, the one who gives has actually acquired in the other's eyes, the power of giving or destroying" (1988: 69). The power that the giver gains over the recipient manifests the absurdity of gifts. Bataille ex plains more fully the absurdity: Not only does he have the power over the recipient that the gift has bestowed on him, but also the recipient is obligated to nullify that power by repaying the gift. The rivalry even entails the return of a greater gift: In order to get even the giver must not only redeem himself, but he must also impose the 'power of the gift' on his rival in turn. In a sense the presents are repaid with interest. Thus the gift is the opposite of what it seemed to be: To give is obviously to lose, but the loss appar ently brings a profit to the one who sustains it. (Bataille 1988: 70)</page><page sequence="8">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 357 This intertwining of power, obligation, and absurdity helps Bataille to show that the gift is not some homogenous pattern of exchange but, rather, that it is more akin to a heterogeneous and irrational phenomenon. Bataille's position also renders individual givers and their social organization ambivalent because there can be no unilat eral response to the demand to give (Richman 1982: 23). According to Bataille, the giver gains rank, and this acquisition depends on one's capacity for bestowing gifts. From the fact of acqui sitions Bataille enumerates a number of what he calls laws. The first law is that appropriation reflects the squandering of surplus re sources. By squandering the surplus, it is prestige that is acquired by the giver, a determinate of one's rank. If social rank can be gained like any other commodity and represents a source of profit, it is still dependent on the wasteful expenditure of resources, which theoreti cally could have been acquired in some other way. The second law expresses the ambiguity and contradictory nature of the gift. Bataille elaborates that the giver "must waste the excess, but he remains eager to acquire even when he does the opposite, and so he makes waste itself an object of acquisition" (1988: 72). And long after the loss of resources, the acquired prestige gained by excessive and im pulsive giving remains with the giver. The final so-called law isolated by Bataille affirms that any individual accumulation of wealth is doomed to destruction because the individual does not genuinely possess the wealth and the social rank that accompanies it. Wealth is analogous to a pipe bomb for Bataille because it can destroy the builder just as readily as its intended victim. The giver lies, for all intends and purposes, to oneself and others because the giver never really possesses the wealth that he or she dispenses (1988: 73-74). Bataille connects the potlatch to sacrificial action, but he does not view it in the same way as Mauss. Although the potlatch is not equivalent to a sacrifice, it does, however, function in a complemen tary way by withdrawing wealth from productive consumption. Bataille elaborates further that "[i]n general, sacrifice withdraws use ful products from profane circulation; in principle the gifts of potlatch liberate objects that are useless from the start" (1988: 76). Within the context of discussing the theory of religion and the role of gift within the theory of E. B. Tylor in contrast to Bataille, Mauss, and his co author Henri Hubert in their classic work, entitled Sacrifice: Its Nature and Function, think that Tylor gives too much weight to the notion of gift in his theory of religion. Mauss and Hubert think that there is a</page><page sequence="9">358 CARL OLSON sense in which a sacrifice is a gift, if one considers that a sacrifice gives a worshiper rights over his/her deity, but this is not sufficient reason with which to build a theory of religion (1968: 4). In her discussion of the Great Sacrifice in Moroccan culture, M. E. Combs Schilling, for instance, denies that the sacrifice, a vigorous attempt to have sexual intercourse with the sacred, is a gift because it is more physically active than a gift and is structured to attract biological power exemplified by sexual intercourse and human birth (1989: 242). Within the context of discussing the gift of women and their distri bution by male kin, Bataille connects the exchange of women, a form of potlatch, with eroticism, an extreme, solitary, human emotion that is rooted in the alternation of affirmation and denial, of fascination and horror, attraction and repulsion (1984: 211). The gift of women is unnatural because to renounce a coveted object represents a kind of inner revolution within the giver. Bataille attributes the erotic value of the given object (a woman in this case) to the prohibition against incest, which calls attention to the covetous nature of the object or to the sexual value of it by the process of prohibition itself (1991: 48). Bataille speculates that the gift of a woman may be a substitute for a sexual act. There is, however, no disputing the fact that both the sexual act and gift provide a relief for the initiator (1991: 57). Since eroticism is excessive by its very nature, Bataille wants to stress the excessive and heterological nature of the gift by linking it with eroticism. Moreover, eroticism represents the most extreme form of dépense, "the sacrifice of the self is the most complete gesture of communication" (Richman 1982: 75). The gift within the flux of time According to Derrida, if the phenomenon of the gift is examined within the context of time, the gift becomes impossible due to the predominance of time. The gift and time share a relationship to the visible, although time, a manifestation of invisibility, does not give itself to be seen, withdrawing itself continuously from visibility. In contrast, the gift calls attention to itself by announcing itself and giving itself to thought as that which is impossible (1992a: 7). In order to think the gift one must not think of it in relation to giving, the circulation of an economy, or exchange. Derrida wants to think that</page><page sequence="10">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 359 aspect of the gift that is strange or foreign to an economy. The gift is only possible at a paradoxical moment when time is torn apart be cause the present is related to temporal synthesis, which makes it impossible to think the present moment of the gift (1992a: 9). In an essay that discusses the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas in his book entitled Psyché: Inventions de l'autre, Derrida imagines a time prior to the gift, a time before the attempt to give, prior to desire, before obliga tion, prior to contract, and before gratitude (1987: 164). Derrida develops further the theme of the impossibility of the gift by isolating three elements of the gift: donor (intention to give), gift (giving of something), and donee (someone other than donor). By assuming that these elements are essential to the notion of the gift, a person demonstrates a precomprehension of the nature of a gift. The three conditions of the gift—donor, gift, and donee—simultaneously designate the conditions for the impossibility of the gift. In other words, Derrida uses the very conditions or elements of the gift against it in order to show its impossibility. These three conditions produce the "annulment, the annihilation, the destruction of the gift" (1992a: 12). The reciprocity of the gift, its return or exchange, annuls the gift. Derrida is attempting to think the nature of the gift devoid of reci procity, return, exchange, or debt. For the gift to be truly what it is, there must be absolutely no returning of a gift and the donor must not expect any restitution. Derrida pushes this line of thinking to its limits by emphasizing that simply recognizing or identifying some thing as a gift is sufficient to annul it. If we push the gift to its limits, Derrida argues that it will not appear as a gift to either the donor or donee. For a gift to be itself, it must not even give itself to someone's field of perception. If it does not appear, the gift cannot be grasped as a gift. Therefore, it is best if the donor and donee forget it in a radical sense that includes the total loss of memory or consciousness of it (1992a: 16). Derrida is suggesting an absolute form of forgetting that makes the gift itself a condition of forgetting: "Forgetting and gift would therefore be each in the condition of the other" (1992a: 18). Derrida thinks that the gift accords with the experience of the trace in the sense of a cinder (1991). From Derrida's perspective, tradi tional views of the gift represent a transcendental illusion. Thus we need to rethink the gift and its impossibility in order to push philoso phy to its limits. Rather than the traditional transcendental illusion of the Western</page><page sequence="11">360 CARL OLSON philosophical understanding of the gift, Derrida wants to be able to see the event of the gift, which is described as irruptive, unmotivated, and disinterested. Derrida explains further: "This word Ereignis, which commonly signifies event, signals toward a thinking of appro priation or of de-propriation that cannot be unrelated to that of the gift" (1992a: 19). This event of the gift, which only adheres to princi ples of disorder and is thus devoid of rules or concepts, is prior to any relationship to a single subject or to more than one subject. This implies that the event (Ereignis) is prior to any relationship of donor and donee that taints the gift of its purity. Within the flux of time, the moment of giving and receiving are two events that cannot exist simultaneously in time because they are separated in the flow of time. If we look for the gift, we are seeking the impossible, which is a form of madness: "To desire, to desire to think the impossible, to desire to give the impossible-this is obviously madness" (1992a: 35). Derrida connects this madness to the previously discussed practice of forget ting and does not intend to suggest that madness, a double ligature of reason and unreason, is a negative experience. According to Derrida, Mauss does not concern himself enough with the incompatibility of the gift and its exchange, whereas Derrida wants to problematize and interrogate their connection in order to call attention to their difference. Agreeing in principle with Bataille's emphasis on the excessive nature of the gift, Derrida states that "[t]he problem of the gift has to do with its nature that is excessive in advance, apriori exaggerated' (1992a: 38). Any gift that is moderate or ordered is not, strictly speaking, a gift. In his work Glas, Derrida equates ex change playfully to castration, the basic principle of exchange: "It castrates, equalizes or lops off [lague] the pleroma; it tends to main tain two forces, two erections, two pressures at the same height" (1986: 59). As the principle of exchange, castration is the difference, which is within the gift itself. For Derrida, the gift and exchange represent a gift and counter-gift, a kind of giving-taking. It is this difference that Mauss neglects in his theory according to Derrida: "The difference between a gift and every other operation of pure and simple exchange is that the gift gives time" (1992a: 41). The gift not only gives time, but it also demands and takes time. Derrida wants to concentrate upon and think about the thing, the gift itself, in time. If one mistakenly reduces the gift to an exchange like the theory of Lévi-Strauss, one terminates the very possibility of the gift. Derrida seeks a thinking that can think about and do the act of giving in an</page><page sequence="12">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 361 excessive sense, to give beyond the proper norm, to give excessively. In fact, it is only the excessive gift, a giving without calculation and measure, that is truly speaking a pure gift, which is one without borders. The excessive aspect of the gift can also be witnessed in the rela tionship between the other, the gift, and violence. By accepting a gift, the other is caught in a trap because the exposed donee places oneself at the mercy of the donor. This point is exemplified by Derrida's characterization of the gift as an annulus, which suggests a ring, collar, necklace, or the chain of the gift (1986: 244). The irreducible violence of the gift is a manifestation of its excessive nature and its very con dition. Within the process of circulation, the violence of the gift rep resents its impurity (1992a: 147). The excessiveness of the gift and its place within the context of time suggest its apocalypse. By moving towards its end, the gift re veals that "[t]he truth of the gift unveils only the non-truth of its end, the end of the gift. Times are (no longer) near, there is time no more" (1992a: 148). Therefore, it is time that destroys the gift, and it is time that operates as the deconstructive agent. If the gift moves inexorably towards its apocalypse, its beginning, which is prior to any exchange, represents a holocaust (a term that Derrida substitutes for Hegel's Opfer or sacrifice). In contrast to Hegel's sacrificial holocaust that manifests the presence of the other ness of the holocaust, Derrida's use of the term holocaust is non present, totally other, and beyond the borders of ontology, leaving only the traces of ashes. For Derrida, both the gift and holocaust share the not in common. Therefore, the pure gift is the holocaust, a gift that burns or annuls itself before it even exchanges anything (1986: 243). The gift is pure in the sense that it is without exchange or expectation of return. The gift within the time of Hinduism The Hindu religious tradition makes a distinction between a gift called daksinâ, an exchange for ritual services rendered by Brahmin priests, and another type of gift termed the dan, a giving vital to village life because the donor gets rid of danger (sankat), various kinds of afflictions (kast), and evil or sin {pap). Although there are some features that overlap, these two kinds of gifts are conceptually differ</page><page sequence="13">362 CARL OLSON ent. Without going into great depth, we will examine the notion of daksinâ before examining the significance of dan. With respect to daksinâ, we will focus on the scholarly work of P. V. Kane and Jan Gonda besides considering some relevant primary source materials, and we will examine the more recent work of Gloria Raheja and Jonathan P. Parry on the notion of dan. The early Hindu tradition emphatically emphasizes the impor tance of giving and the necessity of being generous. According to the ancient Rig Veda (RV), the Vedic god Indra embodies the spirit of giving and serves as a paradigm of the generous ruler. Indra is called the giver (RV 1.54.8), and he is the divine force that gives impetus to liberality (RV 5.30.7). The Vedic poets express a dual expectation of Indra: he is expected to be generous by virtue of his position as king of the Vedic pantheon (RV 3.14.6), and he is expected to punish those who are excessively parsimonious (RV 1.176.4). An earthly king is expected to emulate the heavenly king or Indra to the extent that the generosity of both must overflow in a visible manner. There are also Vedic hymns or stanzas (e.g., RV 5.27.4; 5.33.9; 8.5.37; 8.19.36) praising patrons of the arts who give to poets that Renou and Filliozat refer to a "captationes benevolentiae" (1953: 273). Gonda does not think that Renou and Filliozat do justice to the Vedic poets because their supposition appears to be that "liberality was a natural and inalienable quality of their patrons, that these people could not but be conceived as generous because they were wealthy and it behooves the rich to distribute their possessions to others" (Gonda 1964: 25). The merit of the gift itself is tied to the mental attitude of the giver, the manner in which the gift is acquired, the worthiness of the giver and recipient, and the humble way in which they are given to an other (Kane 1953-1973: 2.847, 849). According to the Manusmrti (4.186), even if all these criteria are met, the gift embodies a danger to the recipient because he or she could become attached to the habit of receiving gifts because there is a danger of losing one's spirituality. The giving of daksinâ is not merely for religious services performed, but it also establishes beneficial partnerships (RV 8.79.5; 10. 151.2). The giving presupposes that gifts are offered within the context of auspicious times and places. In his study of the topic, Gonda demon strates the close connection between daksinâ and sraddhâ (faith) that manifests a mutual trust between the god and his devotees (1960: 42). Gonda conceptualizes an identity between the giver and the gift,</page><page sequence="14">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 363 citing a passage from the epic Mahàbhârata (13.76.13) where the do nor talks of giving oneself. Gonda thinks that giving involves placing "oneself in relation to and then to participate in a second person by means of an object, which however is not actually an object, but a part of one's own self' (1964: 16; 1965: 209). In order to support his position, Gonda refers to Gerardus van der Leeuw, the Dutch pheno menologist of religion, who supports his own position by referring to Mauss. Bataille and Derrida reject this kind of monistic identity be tween the giver and the gift. The French postmodernists would also object to Gonda's claim that the reciprocity between the giving and receiving parties is equivalent to a circular process of mutual giving and receiving that not only maintains the world but also that upon which the continu ance of life depends (1965: 214). Moreover, they would be critical of Kane's claim that "[a] gift once completed by acceptance is irrevoca ble" (2.886). Kane wants to emphasis that once a gift is accepted this is equivalent to ownership of it. And this acceptance can be either mental, verbal, or physical (3.474). From the perspective of Bataille and Derrida, Kane misses the heterological element within the gift itself. This is not entirely true of Heesterman who perceives a risk in giving because the priest must accept the evil and impurity (papman) associated with the performance of death rites and acceptance of the patron's death impurity (1964: 3). There is a conspicuous absence of the obligation by the priest to return the gift. Kane and Gonda also appear to miss the sacrificial feature of the gift that is textually sup ported by the Manusmrti (1.86) for a degenerate age and the work of Biardeau on ancient Indian sacrifice (1976: 27). From the perspective of Bataille and Derrida, Kane and Gonda carry on the legacy of Mauss by essentially agreeing with him that groups participate in exchanges and not merely individuals, those who exchange are moral, the gift contains something of the spiritual essence of the donor, which prompts the recipient to return the gift and establishes an enduring bond between persons. Kane and Gonda also agree with Mauss that a gift commands a gift in return that flows from the giver to the recipient and back again from the receiver to the donor. Moreover, the gift possesses a powerful binding force that unites two parties. Kane and Gonda do not appear to find anything excessive about the gift during the Vedic period that would confirm the position of Bataille. This is not true of Romila Thapar who appears to support</page><page sequence="15">364 CARL OLSON in part Bataille's theory of the gift by stressing the element of the potlatch in Vedic sacrifice. Thapar does not think that the reciprocity between the major castes of givers is balanced because the Kshatriya caste assumed the greatest burden of giving, whereas the Brahmin caste mostly played the role of recipients. Thapar thinks that the use of wealth tended to transform the sacrifice into a kind of potlatch (1994: 315-316). Thapar and Bataille agree that the potlatch is a series of counter-gifts that creates a debt encountered in a subsequent ritual context that tends to maximize the compulsion of giving in ever greater amounts. In a similar spirit and in reaction to the theory of Mauss, J. C. Heesterman argues that ancient Vedic priests deconstructed sacrifice, a multi-functional, pivotal, broken world that hovers dangerously on the brink of collapse, and renders problematic any gift-theory of sacrifice because such a theory does not function within a context of a ritual killing followed by a communal meal. Heesterman finds the three major elements of the sacrifice—killing, destruction, and feast —paradoxical because the killing of the sacrificial victim and gift to the gods are necessarily destroyed by fire, a distinctive feature that separates the sacrifice from the gift (1993: 14). Within this context, Heesterman perceives a secret connected to the burnt oblation and destruction, which possesses nothing in common with a gift or offer ing of food to the gods, but rather represents an original absence of gift and "abandonment in self-abnegation" by the sacrificer (1993: 18). From a different perspective, Deriida grasps the insights of Heesterman as evidence of the sacrifice sacrificing itself because the sacrifice is inherently a supplement of itself (1986: 244). In comparison to Kane and Gonda, Heesterman is more sensitive to the heterogeneous nature of sacrifice and gift because he sees an inner tension in sacrifice, which embodies order on the surface but internally threatens catastrophic disorder. The gift of food is not a harmless exchange because the sacrificer makes a gift of his dead self to his guests and gets rid of his burden of death, a scenario that indicates a tension in the exchange that is an antithetical and a potentially agonistic mode of acceptance. Whereas Kane and Gonda have a tendency to see harmony and stability in the gift, Heesterman views it as characterized by tension, instability, and conflict due to the onus of death, although the elements of contest and conflict are mitigated by the countervailing features of alliance between host and guest (1993: 206-207). Embodied within the notion of gift is, for</page><page sequence="16">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 365 Heesterman, its inherent deconstructive feature, a potential to re place the sacrifice itself within an alternating context of conflict and alliance. As noted previously, the other major type of gift is called dân in Hindu cultures, which embodies more of an obligation to accept than any right to claim a gift. In her study of the Hindi-speaking region of northern India in the village of Pahansu, Raheja emphasizes the importance of auspiciousness (subfi) and inauspiciousness (nâsubh), which both vary with the context, with relation to dân. Assuming that conditions are proper and participants are appropriate, the donor possesses an opportunity to transfer inauspiciousness to the donee and create the advent of auspiciousness. From the viewpoint of the Brahmins, there is a poison in the gift because it embodies the sin and evil of the donor (1988: 32). Jonathan Parry criticizes Raheja's position because his own field-work in Bañaras indicates to him that the poison in the dân is not inauspiciousness, as Raheja claims, but it is rather sin and pollution that form a seamless source of misfortune (1994: 136). Parry discusses the gift given to a priest by pilgrims for rendering funeral services for the deceased in the city of Bañaras. According to Parry, it is important for a pilgrim to be a unilateral giver and not to accept any gifts from another person. In fact, the best form of a gift is secret and without a recipient. A good example of a secret kind of gift is money that is surreptitiously thrown into the Ganges river (Parry 1994: 121). Parry also indicates the contradictions and prob lems associated with giving. If a gift is, for instance, to be given only to a priest of unimpeachable moral character, the giver cannot know for certain if the recipient possesses such character. The recipient also functions as a retainer for the sins and moral filth of the donors, which places a tremendous burden on the priest (1994: 123). Moreo ver, these priests of death are not worthy vessels for the acceptance of gifts, which taints the quality of all gifts (1994: 128). And if the Brahmin priest attempts to approximate the life-style of a world renouncer, the priest's acceptance of gifts compromises by definition the ideal of an ascetic, because the priest loses any semblance of ascetic autonomy by immersion into the material and social world of exchange of gifts. In contrast to Raheja's claim that the dân is not a hierarchical prestation, Party finds evidence for a pre-eminently hier archical conceptualization of dân within the context of the gift ex changes associated with death in the city of Bañaras (1994: 137).</page><page sequence="17">366 CARL OLSON Parry and Raheja do agree, however, that there is a poison in the gift within the respective social contexts that they studied. With respect to the work of Parry, Derrida helps us to see that the phenomenon of the gift can be another way to help us apprehend death. Derrida suggests that death is essential to the process of ex change because "it is only on the basis of death, and in its name, that giving and taking become possible" (1992: 44). If, for Derrida, the gift itself is inaccessible, unpresentable, secret, and not present, it is death that cannot be removed from the donor or recipient, and it is some thing that cannot be given or received by another. Death, for Derrida, is a feature of life that one can only take upon oneself, whereas Parry wants to insist that the priest accepts the burden from the pilgrim by accepting the latter's gift. From Derrida's perspective, Parry does not account for the element of time, a feature also ne glected by Raheja in her study. This is exactly the element that Pierre Bourdieu calls scholars to recognize in his work: "To restore to prac tice its practical truth, we must therefore reintroduce time into the theoretical representation of a practice which, being temporally structured is intrinsically defined by its tempo" (1986: 8). The counter gift, for instance, must be deferred and be different in order to avoid any resemblance to swapping or lending. The time element—the interval—in the exchange of gift and counter-gift is ultimately ex posed by misrecognition (méconnaisance) of the limits and constraints of the practice of exchange (1986: 5-6). Following the suggestion of Bourdieu, Bell also warns us that by abstracting the act of giving from its temporal situation and reducing its convoluted strategies to a set of reversible structures, one's theoretical analysis will misconstrue the real dynamics of the practice (1992: 83). The possibility of a pure gift From the perspective of Bataille, Kane and especially Gonda are captive to the theory of Mauss, although they are able to witness that giving represents the acquisition of power as stressed by Bataille. Raheja and Parry are at least able to perceive a poison in the gift. At times, there are hints that Raheja and Parry can also see the irra tional and excessive aspects of the gift. There are suggestions that the scholars of the Indian notion of gift recognize, along with Bataille, the role of power in the practice of giving, the giver surpassing one</page><page sequence="18">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 367 self in the act of giving and a relationship between giving and renun ciation. Kane and Gonda do not, however, stress or appear to recog nize the absurdity of gifts that Bataille emphasizes in his work, al though Heesterman is aware of its paradoxical nature. None of the scholars of Indian culture seems to recognize the potential erotic nature of the gift, which for Bataille is indicative of its heterological nature. From Derrida's perspective, Gonda, Parry, and Raheja do not really think the gift because they do not think that aspect of it that is strange. The theorists of Indian gift giving try to think the gift in the present moment, which Derrida thinks is impossible. Derrida is also the only one who attempts to imagine a time prior to the gift. The four investigators of the Hindu notion of gift manifest their precomprehension of the nature of a gift by isolating the three ele ments of a gift (i.e., donor, donee, and the gift itself). What appear to the four theorists to be the bases of the possibility for a gift is indica tive of its impossibility for Derrida because of the destructive nature of these elements, which Derrida identifies with its reciprocity, an invitation to give. The genuine or pure gift is devoid of the notion of reciprocity or expectation of restitution. By pushing the gift to its limit and looking for its nonpresence, it will not appear as a gift either to a donor or to a recipient. From Derrida's perspective, Kane and Gonda represent traditional views of the nature of a gift. And even though Parry and Raheja perceived a poison in the gift in their respectively different ways, they are not prepared totally to rethink the heterological nature of the gift. Parry and Raheja are also not ready to rethink the gift prior to its relationship of donor and recipi ent that steals it of its purity. The scholars mentioned cannot imagine the gift within the flux of time and the impossibility of two events— giving and receiving—existing simultaneously in time that suggests the giving and taking of time by the gift. With respect to rethinking the gift within time, Derrida wants one to risk madness when attempting to think the impossible. Derrida wants us to look at and consider the difference within the gift itself, which he identifies with castration, whereas Bataille perceives some thing erotic in the exchange of gift and counter-gift. The emphasis on the excessive nature of the gift by Bataille and Derrida manifests its violent nature, which for Derrida represents its impurity. Derrida connects the excessiveness of the gift with its apocalypse and subse quent holocaust, a pure gift. But this pure gift is an impossibility</page><page sequence="19">368 CARL OLSON because it is annulled before it is ever exchanged. To be devoid of exchange or expectation of return are paradoxical characteristics of the pure gift. Derrida seems ironically to suggest that a pure gift is an impossible possibility. This is evident, for instance, in Derrida's reading of the story of Abraham from the Hebrew Bible, which represents a secret between a man of ardent faith and his God. All communication between the two unequal parties must be suspended to.enable the sacrifice to become a pure gift. Derrida elaborates Abraham's position: "Abra ham is in a position of nonexchange with respect to God, he is in secret since he doesn't speak to God and expects neither response nor reward from him" (1992: 96). The exchange of gift and counter-gift are put at risk in the sense that Abraham expects nothing in return. And yet he is aware that God offers recompense at the exact moment of renunciation. Abraham's son is given back to him because "he renounced calculation" (1992: 97). The situation of Abraham indi cates the not of the gift—its aneconomy—which represents in the story a gift of life or, from another perspective, a gift of death. In conclusion, the four scholars of Indian culture that we have considered in this essay are not necessarily wrong about what they write concerning the gift in Indian culture. But from the perspective of Bataille and Derrida, they fail to see the heterological aspect of the gift. Derrida would go even further by stressing that they fail to push the notion of the gift to its limits. If the four scholars did push the notion of the gift to its limits, they would have discovered that the context of gift giving is indeterminate and full of ambiguities. Not only do the positions of the postmodernists give us something to think about when reconsidering the notion of gift, they help us to grasp the more radical implications of the gift and enable us to see that the notion of gift is not simply about exchange, obligation, and receiving. Bataille and Derrida make the excessive and irrational potential of a gift more lucid in contrast to the theory of Mauss and those that he influenced. By examining the notion of gift within the context of time, we are more likely to grasp its powerful, paradoxical, ambigu ous, contradictory, absurd, and erotic aspects.</page><page sequence="20">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 369 Concluding remarks From the postmodern perspectives of Bataille and Derrida, the Maussian theory of gift giving is static, even though the theory is developed within the context of the perspective of evolution. Mauss' approach to his subject seems to imply that it is possible to view the practice of gift giving as an unconditioned observer, from a privileged vantage point outside the flux of time. Mauss does not take the proc ess of time very seriously from the perspective of the postmodernists because the explanation of gift giving does not require a sequence, although Mauss does not explicitly deny development and change (Collins 1985: 54). Since history is continuous and transitive for Mauss, present time develops out of the past, which implies that the past continues to exist in the present. Because the past shapes and influences the present, there is no discontinuity between these two moments of time, whereas Bataille and Derrida stress the discontinu ity of the moments of time. From the perspective of the postmodern thinkers, Mauss cannot account for historical disruptions and discon tinuity very easily in his theory. With Bataille's embrace of and em phasis on the potlatch, he wants to stress the significance of periodic disruption of the orderly sequence of time. Furthermore, if Mauss had given the process of time more attention in his theory, he would not have assumed the ontological presence of the act. From the postmodern viewpoint, by placing the phenomenon of gift into his torical flux, it cannot be made into a universal and timeless category. Moreover, if Mauss had placed his notion of gift giving within the flux of time, his theory would not have also assumed that gift giving is an objective social fact because within the flux of time there are only traces—from the perspective of Derrida, for instance. Mauss is also interested to show that the worldwide practices of gift giving can be reduced to their elementary forms and that human nature is fundamentally social, whereas Bataille and Derrida tend to stress heterogeneity over homogeneity. Mauss attempts to get at the simplest forms of gift giving in order to discern the unconscious men tal teleology of the practice. This is a good example of Mauss' at tempt to uncover unconscious and conscious meanings of gift giving from a cross-cultural perspective that would shed light on common features, a procedure that is consistent with his attempt to correct a shortcoming of Durkheim's theory by bringing into closer proximity the disciplines of sociology and psychology (Mauss 1966a). Nonethe</page><page sequence="21">370 CARL OLSON less, this procedure assumes that the best way to approach the study of gift giving is by finding the simplest and earliest examples of soci ety that one can find (Carrier 1995: 86). Tlfis is not, however, the best way to proceed because there is no reason to accept the evolu tionary viewpoint that assumes that religions develop from simple to more complex forms. Mauss' theory of gift giving is an example of a twentieth-century form of rationalism, which borrows elements from empiricism and Kantian a priori thinking. But this is a rationalism that is socially grounded, a product of social groups. Within the Kantian scheme of thinking and by each step of analysis, unity is always presupposed by the philosopher, which Kant calls the synthetic unity of appercep tion. Thus, Kant claims that it is thinking that unifies, forming a unity of a particular kind. According to Derrida, the principle of reason is not simply reason. Derrida wants to heed Heidegger's call in his work entitled Der Satz vom Grund to respond to the call of the principle of reason. When we obey the call of the principle of reason we ask about its grounding principle. By following this track of think ing, we find ourselves in a circle because we are trying to account for reason by means of reason. Another possibility is to encounter an abyss, which is defined as "the impossibility for a principle of ground ing to ground itself' (Derrida 1983: 9). Derrida calls into question whether or not it is permissible to account for the principle of reason by using reason itself. Accompanying the modem dominance of the principle of reason, for Derrida, is also an interpretation of the es sence of beings as objects, a representation that is encountered by a subject. Although there is a dominance in Western philosophy of the principle of reason and its corollary representational thinking that assures the subject doing the thinking of its own presence, Derrida asserts that we never encounter, scrutinize, or interrogate the origin of the principle of reason itself. Derrida concludes by stating that reason is a single species of thought, which does not mean that we can conclude that thought is irrational (1983: 16). In contrast to the rationality that grounds the work of Mauss, the postmodem modes of thinking of Derrida and Bataille are anti-foundational, radically skeptical of any theory, and distrustful of any possible universal claims of reason. Although it is not necessary to accept any transcen dental claims for reason, there is a real danger of disparaging reason in this way or embracing the irrational, as Bataille tends to do in his writings.</page><page sequence="22">EXCESS, TIME, AND THE PURE GIFT 371 Calvin Schrag, for instance, points to the purposelessness of the postmodern mode of thinking: "With the subversion of a logos grounded epistemê, all that remains is a succession of hetero-doxa in which each prevailing opinion is countered by a new opinion within a conflictual rhapsody of 'rhetorical agonistics' that has neither goal nor purpose" (1992: 167-168). Not only is there a danger of being left with rhetorical opinions that are as relative as other opinions, there is also a danger of undermining the solidity of one's own starting point by questioning the foundations of rational thinking. It is not neces sary to assume that thinking is grounded in reason, or that the foun dation of reason is problematic because it is possible to ground think ing in valuation, an axiological hypothesis, according to Neville, as part of his call for a reconceiving of the foundations of thinking (1981: 170). Mauss would agree with Neville's argument for the social character of thinking and its demand of responsibility. It is important to be aware that thinking is conditioned by history and the social and cultural milieu in which it finds itself. There is also a danger in Derrida's position of undermining his own claim to truth(s) by de constructing the rational distinctions between subject and object. Mauss' work on the gift is an excellent example of the importance that he placed on classification in order to enhance human under standing by connecting ideas and unifying knowledge. Mauss views classification as a "first philosophy of nature" that is rooted in social relations which provide the distinctions for such a system (Durkheim and Mauss 1963: 82-83). Mauss envisions a social hierarchy along with a logical hierarchy and unity of knowledge. And the resem blances and differences uncovered by a process of classification are due to affection more than intellect "because they affect the senti ments of groups differently" (Durkheim and Mauss 1963: 84). Bataille and Derrida are opposed to hierarchies of all sorts. From Derrida's perspective, Mauss creates a metaphysical and social hier archy that is a result of representational thinking. Derrida's method of deconstruction does not destroy preexisting structures from the outside, but it rather subverts them from the inside, which is another way of overturning hierarchies and subverting representational think ing (1976: 24; 1981: 41). From the postmodern perspective, Mauss' theory presupposes an ontological presence of people engaged in gift giving over a continu ous period of time. No such claim to ontological presence can be asserted by Mauss with absolute certainty from the postmodern per</page><page sequence="23">372 CARL OLSON spective, because one cannot make the assumption that what is real is so by virtue of the fact that is it simply present. According to Derrida, the philosophical presuppositions behind Mauss' gift theory are in dicative of what the postmodernist call logocentrism, a type of onto theology characteristic of Western philosophy and its metaphysics of presence. By presupposing this ontological presence, Mauss tends to emphasize anthropomorphism as a primary characteristic of much of the religious context of gift giving, whereas Derrida tends to stress difference and absence in his philosophy in order to demonstrate the bankruptcy of the philosophical tradition of the Enlightenment. By assuming that metaphysics is the basis of Western culture, Derrida's attempt to undermine the metaphysical tradition of Western thought results, nonetheless, in giving metaphysics an exaggerated impor tance (Putnam 1992: 124). An important aspect of Mauss' work is his intention to strip the notion of gift of any irrational elements, whereas Bataille embraces the disorder of the Dionysian aspect of the gift by emphasizing the potlatch. Bataille wants to undermine the harmonious reciprocity that Mauss tends to stress in his work. Rather than the homogeneity that is emphasized by Mauss, the heterological method of Bataille wants to stress the heterogeneous aspects of knowledge, aspects which are beyond the purview of scientific knowledge because it is only concerned with homogenous elements. If Mauss tends to stress the homogeneous aspect of gift giving, Bataille and his heterological method, which he borrowed from Nietzsche, is strictly opposed to any orderly, homogeneous representation of the practice of gift giv ing. For Derrida, knowledge is not merely objective, as Mauss sug gests in his theory, because that which we know occurs within a historical, relational, and personal context. What we can know is relative, indeterminate, and participatory, which suggests that our knowledge is forever incomplete. Although it is not necessary to em brace the radical skepticism of this particular postmodernist, it does appear prudent to include both the homogeneous and heterogeneous elements of this fascinating practice when rethinking the notion of gift giving.
