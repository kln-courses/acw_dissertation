<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Encounters with Ancient Egypt. Series Edited by Peter Ucko. London: UCL Press, 2003. Eight volumes. This series of eight books derives from a confer ence entitled "Encounters with Ancient Egypt" held at the Institute of Archaeology, University College Lon don in December 2000, though many of the papers selected for publication are revised and augmented, and further chapters have been specially commis sioned. The credit for the original innovative plan for the conference and for the simultaneous issue of these books as an integral scholarly enterprise belongs to the series editor, Peter Ucko, Director of the Institute. Although he handsomely acknowledges the enthusias tic support he obtained from his academic colleagues, his associate editors and the staff of the Institute and of UCL Press, the remarkably quick publication of these excellently edited books could certainly not have been achieved without his inspiration and drive. His outline of the aims of the series, which ranges over a wide variety of scholarly disciplines and covers a time span from the Prehistoric era to the twentieth century A.D., includes the following statements: "One (feature of the books) is the overall attempt to move the study of Ancient Egypt into the mainstream of recent ad vances in archaeological and anthropological practice and interpretation. . . . Egyptology has been rightly criticized for often being insular; the methodologies and conclusions of the discipline have been seen by others as having developed with little awareness of ar chaeologies elsewhere. . . . Until now, questions have rarely been asked about the way Egyptians thought of their own past or about non-Egyptian peoples and places. Nor has the discipline of Egyptology explored, in any depth, the nature of its evidence, or the way contemporary cultures regarded Ancient Egypt. . . . As a result of this series, the study of Ancient Egypt will be significantly enriched and deepened" (Series Editor's Foreword). These claims demand that the series should be evaluated as an entity; yet in the light of such a critique, the present reviewers (two Egyptol ogists and one Hellenistic historian) face an unenvi able task in attempting to review the series as a whole, for not only are there many disciplines involved that they do not control, but they themselves represent tra ditional scholastic interests and methodologies that it is the professed aim of these volumes to supersede. We treat the books here in the approximate chrono logical order of their subject matter. The author of each individual review is noted parenthetically after the title of the book. Mysterious Lands (H. S. Smith) In their thought-provoking introduction entitled "Mapping the Unknown in Ancient Egypt" the edi tors, David O'Connor and Stephen Quirke, define the subject matter of this book thus: "The 'mysteries' re viewed in this volume arise in the gap between what we think we know of the world from archaeology, ge ography, and astronomy, and what we have found in Egyptian written and pictorial accounts of the world" (p. 1). They discuss with exemplary critical insight the available source material, pointing out the severe shortage of archaeological information from outside Egypt to control the location or reality of "foreign" places named or depicted in the relatively massive Egyptian written and pictorial sources. They rightly insist upon the overriding importance of context in assessing this material and upon the linguistic and conceptual problems inherent in the translation of ancient names by modern topographical labels. To exemplify the critical problems they discuss succinctly various typical dilemmas: the location of the southern toponym "Irem" and its doubtful identity with earlier "Yam"; the symbolism, whether fixed or changing, of the names of the "Nine Bows"; and the differentiated Egyptian attitudes towards "Libya" on the one hand and "Nubia" and "Punt" on the other. They summa rize the message of this brilliant essay thus: "A self critical historiography with archaeological method at its fore requires keen observation of the potential and the limitations of sources" (p. 2). The following chapters (the last excepted) may be regarded as case-studies. James P. Allen's chapter is the best succinct account of "The Egyptian Concept of the World" this reviewer has read, explaining clearly and vividly its Nile-centered character, the triune cosmic picture of sky, earth, and under-sky 173</page><page sequence="2">174 JARCE XLI (2004) ("Duat"), the circular form of the universe, the emer gence of created beings from the dark primeval ocean ("Nu"), and the various pictorial images for the path of the sun through the day and night sky. Antonio Loprieno's chapter, "Travel and Fiction in Egyptian Literature" gives a comprehensive, chronologically ordered account of journeys abroad and foreign set tings in literary and narrative texts of all periods. His fascinating, if sometimes bewildering, application of the concepts and terminology of modern literary criti cism to various genres of text illuminates the peren nial problems of defining the canon of "Egyptian literature" and of discussing its "fictional" and "fic tive" aspects. Loprieno concludes that: "Throughout the historical evolution of Egyptian literary texts, dif ferent models for the representation of space can evidently be detected. In chronological sequence they indicate a gradual divorce between Egypt as a na tion and Egyptian literature as cultural discourse" (pp. 50-51). This hypothetical evolution perhaps in part derives from Loprieno's definitions, but, if con firmed, will be of critical value in examining other areas of Egyptian social, cultural and psychological development. Dimitri Meeks' study, "Locating Punt," is a masterly exposition of correct method in treating Egyptian to pographical sources. By discussing in turn each of the elements in the arguments that have produced a scholarly consensus that "Punt" was located on the African continent and by analyzing contextually and comprehensively every strand of available evidence from the earliest to the latest times (texts, represen tations, archaeological discoveries, zoological, bio logical, and mineralogical indications), Meeks has converted this reviewer to the opinion that a loca tion in the Arabian peninsula (suggested in the nine teenth century) fits the totality of the evidence better and that the accepted consensus was based on un warranted selectivity and bias in the use of sources. Whether Meeks' view will be generally accepted re mains to be seen, but his essay masterfully exempli fies the type of approach advocated by the editors. Stephen P. Harvey's contribution "Interpreting Punt" covers some of the same ground, but concentrates (like so many previous studies) on the famous "Punt reliefs" of Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el-Bahri, which he considers in terms of various types of geographic, cultural and artistic "landscape." This produces some interesting observations on the validity of earlier in terpretations without specifically addressing the issue of location. In "The Emergence of Libya on the Horizon of Egypt" Steven Snape gives a balanced and workman like account of the restricted archaeological, textual, and pictorial sources. He discusses the crucial ques tions of the new ethnic groups who appeared in Libya in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C. and of the defensive wars of the Ramesside Pharaohs against them. In this context he summarizes the re sults of his recent excavations for Liverpool University in the fortress of Zawiyet Umm el-Rakham in the Mersa Matruh area, which have shed much-needed light not only on the Ramesside defensive system but also on Egyptian trade by sea in the Late Bronze Age with the Aegean, Cyprus, and the Levant. In his suc cinct summary, Snape offers the interesting hypothe sis that the establishment of this trade circuit may itself have been the catalyst for the incursion into Libya of the new groups who eventually took over the kingship in Egypt itself. These incursions into Libya form but a part of "The Mystery of the 'Sea Peoples' " reviewed by Eric H. Cline and David O'Connor, perhaps the most sig nificant controversy in early Near Eastern and Medi terranean history engendered by purely Egyptian source material. This material, however, is limited to a few brief textual passages and names of foreign peoples on the monuments of Merenptah and Ramesses III, and is so inadequate that the topic has become prey to repeated speculation based upon little added evidence. Cline and O'Connor's thorough and sober review subjects sources, suggested identi fications of peoples, and controversies to a balanced critique and provides a detailed analysis of the prin cipal pictorial source, the Medinet Habu reliefs, in which their acute observation and understanding of Egyptian methods of representation elicit some revi sions and new data. They conclude that "it is likely to be the un-thought-out nature of the methodologies that have been applied to the 'mystery' of the Sea Peo ples that lies behind the current exceedingly unsatis factory nature of our understanding of the relevant events" (p. 133) and that until more archaeological evidence emerges to correct the imbalance in the sources, "the Sea Peoples seem destined to epitomize a classic disjunction between archaeological and his torical accounts of the past. Few other peoples present such a stimulating challenge" (p. 134). The next three chapters return to the subject of the metaphysical geography of the Egyptian afterworld. Peter Robinson, a cartographer and Egyptologist, gives a concise but illuminating account of the Mid dle Kingdom "map" found in the "Book of the Two Ways" on certain coffins from el-Bersheh, depicting the celestial regions through which the deceased was believed to journey by boat on his way to the "Man sion of Osiris." His discussion of this book's relation ship to the contemporary texts of the coffin of Heqata from Aswan and to sections of the New Kingdom works depicting the underworld is instructive, and his</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 175 interpretation of the "map" as both a guide for the journey and a symbolic landscape for the rite de pas sage from death through mummification to revivifi cation, though not novel, is well-presented. Stephen Quirke's typically penetrating chapter on "Measuring the Underworld" gives a comprehensive survey of the use of exact figures in Egyptian funerary composi tions to describe mythical features of the underworld (e.g., "the fourteen mounds" and "the channels of Ra and Osiris") and concludes that these exact measure ments are a poetic device for asserting human control over the uncontrollable, adducing telling parallels for such measurements from the New Testament Book of Revelation and from Dante's Purgatory. This detailed topic leads Quirke to range widely; he includes a succinct analysis of Egyptian funerary compositions and a critique of synoptic editions of these works, a discussion of female ownership of funerary papyri in relation to the papyrus of Satiah, and comments on Egyptian spatial depiction and upon the origin of "maps." For those Egyptologists who tend to dis miss the funerary books as mythical texts irrelevant to the understanding of Egyptian culture and society, reading Quirke is a salutary experience. John Tait examines the "Book of the Fayum," a schematic mythologically-based topography of the cult places of that region known from Ptolemaic-Roman papyrus texts and the walls of the temple of Komombo. This undoubtedly "mysterious" work had been largely ne glected in recent times until Beinlich's re-edition (1991). Tait's comprehensive analysis illuminates how Egyptian celestial geography, itself conceptualized in part on the model of the Nile valley, was drawn upon by scholarly priests in the Late Period to create a sche matic sacral topography of cult places on earth, and his conclusions as to the ancient purpose and usage of this book and the reasons for early Egyptologists' interest in it are well-balanced and plausible. In the concluding chapter, an anthropologist, Robert Layton, exploits the literature of a wide variety of disciplines to situate the problems of understand ing Egyptian depictions, language, and thought within "The Wider Context." Part of his message, though fa miliar, is very relevant: "there are real difficulties of drawing on our own culture and time to elucidate an cient ritual landscapes depicted on Egyptian coffins, since we have our own expectations of religion and belief, mostly built up over two and a half millennia of Greco-Roman philosophy and Judaeo-Christian worship" (p. 208). Valuable also are Layton's applica tion of Gombrich's characterization of the nature of artistic representation to Egyptian depictions, and his ethnographical parallels drawn from the Yoruba and Hopi cultures for aspects of the Egyptian conceptual ization of the universe. This distinguished book shows how sharper textual and art historical criticism of Egyptian sources to gether with their analysis in a wider variety of cultural settings could valuably improve our understanding of ancient geography and mythical topography. But certain of the major problems discussed can only be solved by question-oriented fieldwork and analytical archaeology in areas outside Egypt's modern borders, a conclusion that also applies to the many unlocated toponyms in Egyptian texts, which are not treated in this book. "Never Had the Like Occurred": Egypt's view of its past (H. S. Smith) In his introduction, the editor, John Tait, thought fully and critically reviews the types of sources that re flect Egypt's view of the past, noting the concepts underlying the whole range of "official" religious and royal texts, namely that Egypt was where the cosmos came into being, that other lands were peripheral, and that the past was a model for the present and fu ture. He stresses that, whereas Egyptologists have pre viously mainly focused on the perceived conscious "archaism" in the use of ancient texts and artistic models in the Saite Period (664-525 B.C.), this book aims to combine all types of evidence from all peri ods down to the end of the first millennium B.C.; in practice, however, texts and depictions are (inevita bly) the principal sources used. He next discusses Egyptian "identity," especially in relation to "foreign ers," a subject that has only tangential relevance to that of this book and overlaps with chapters in Myste rious Lands, Ancient Egypt in Africa, and Ancient Per spectives on Egypt. He also comments on Egyptian concepts of time, drawing attention to the ideologi cal nature of some of the source material and to the very uneven survival of Egyptian written documents, whether considered chronologically, geographically or in terms of genre of text. After referring to the dis tortions that may occur in literary texts placed in past settings.and to "archaism" in the arts, he concludes: "That the Egyptians made deliberate use of the past is beyond all doubt. It was clearly embedded in cen tral features of Egyptian culture. . . . How it had been recorded, and what questions should be asked of it, were matters specific to Egyptian culture" (pp. 12-13). E. P. Uphill's chapter entitled "The Ancient Egyp tian View of World History" fills a niche as a valuable complement to Allen's in Mysterious Lands, since Egyp tian ideas about the beginnings of the world and the lengths of reign of the cosmic gods, demigods and prehistoric kings are currently among the most un fashionable subjects for comment. Using the Sothic</page><page sequence="4">176 JARCE XLI (2004) cycle as the basic era and comparing the figures in various king-lists, he computes lengths of millions of millions of years assigned in king-lists to these divine "dynasties." As Uphill salutarily reminds us, there are good parallels for this in Indian cosmological and reli gious thought; a "day" of Brahma's life was regarded as the equivalent of 4,320,000,000 human years. Al though his methods of calculation may be challenged, his study brings sharply into focus the Egyptian view of the continuity of the divine and human world as part of an indivisible creation. He also suggests a new interpretation of the distinction between the two Egyptian terms for "eternity," regarding djet as describing "past eternity" and neheh as "future eter nity," a tempting solution, but one in conflict with those of other scholars, as Tait observes in his introduction. Whitney Davis' presentation "Archaism and Mod ernism in the Reliefs of Hesy-Ra" begins with a long theoretical introduction, expressed in abstract and abstruse art historical terminology, in which he trenchantly impugns the whole methodology of art historical discussions as conducted in Egyptology and also dismisses Baines' influential hypothesis of the role of "decorum"?i.e., propriety of depiction?in Egyptian art. On his specific topic, his major points are that the six extant acacia panels (all illustrated) re trieved from the tomb of Hesy-Ra at Saqqara are not datable by their archaeological context nor by the seal of the Horus Neterykhet (Djoser) that was found there but out of context; that Stevenson Smith's attribu tion of the reliefs to the transition from the Second to Third Dynasties is not reliable; and that the panels may be divided into two sets on the basis of differ ences in design and distribution of the hieroglyphs, but that the two most famous panels (CG 1426 and 1427) should be assigned to a single major artist, a conclusion that he argues on the basis of a single de tail, an incised line on the inkwells of Hesy-Ra's scribal palette. After discussing at length with much inter esting detail the "cultural temporality" and the "in tentionality of cultural temporality" of the reliefs, he concludes that they are both "archaistic" and "modern istic" and that: "Hesy's sculptor of 1426, subjected to the inertial drag of existing tradition, also attached or re-attached himself to tradition by replicating earlier and older configurative selections in the context of his contemporaneity and modernism, even his avant-gard ism" (p. 57). Clearly there are lessons of value here, but unless Davis is willing to simplify his concepts and terminology to the comprehensions of normal "non art historical" readers of English, they will pass over all our heads unheeded. Dietrich Wildung's chapter first discusses succinctly the re-use of Middle Kingdom sculpture throughout subsequent eras, giving some fine illustrations of the difficulties of dating re-used and archaizing works. After characterizing the sculptures and royal tombs of the Eleventh Dynasty in Thebes as a new develop ment based in the Upper Egyptian tradition of the Old Kingdom, he describes how the removal of the royal residence to the Memphite area in the reign of Amenemhat I led to the adoption of the Old King dom pyramid as a model for the royal tomb, to a rev erence for Kings Djoser and Snofru and to the use of Memphite Old Kingdom models in early Twelfth Dynasty royal statuary. He sees the "forward-looking" mentality displayed in at least some Middle Kingdom literary texts as reflected in this sculpture. While there is little new here for readers of Wildung, his chapter valuably and lucidly documents how by looking back to a "golden age" and re-absorbing selectively its tradi tions into current modes, an original but unified "clas sical" tradition was set for the future. Robert Morkot's chapter "Archaism and Innova tion in Art from the New Kingdom to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty" wisely reviews the material backwards, start ing with the well-known debt of Kushite and Saite Period sculpture to Old Kingdom models. He notes the inspiration of the monuments of Djoser and the evidence that these archaizing tendencies may have started in Lower Egypt just before the Kushite inva sion. However, he also stresses the debt displayed by the reliefs of the Kushite and Saite Period tombs of Montuemhat, Ibi and others to New Kingdom Theban tomb-painting, and detects both a "Kushite" and an "Egyptian" tradition in the depictions of the God's Wives of Amen-Ra. He next discusses the influence of New Kingdom and earlier works from Memphis, the Delta and Hermopolis on the art of the Libyan Period, and finally the problems of New Kingdom "archaism," noting the debt of Eighteenth Dynasty sculpture to both Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasty models. He ends by warning that only a fraction of the material sur vives, with considerable biases in its places of origin, and that "archaism" often serves as the starting point for a whole new artistic movement. No doubt the ex cellent and up-to-date reviews of Wildung and Morkot will fail to satisfy Davis' methodological requirements, but they will be of real value to readers; significantly, perhaps, they reach conclusions strikingly similar to his own. The next three chapters show how far studies of Egyptian literature have recently progressed, from philological works mainly concentrated on establish ing correct translations to analytical and comparative investigations using the concepts of modern literary criticism. In his chapter "Literature as a Construc tion of the Past in the Middle Kingdom" Ludwig D Morenz fruitfully discusses the issues raised by the at tribution of literary texts to famous figures of antiq</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 177 uity, by the use of past settings and pre-existing genres in framing narratives, by the construction of bygone "dark ages" for comparison with the present and fu ture, and by certain particular cases where historical events may in fact be reflected. These "literary" texts, composed to provide both entertainment (Egyptian "amusement of the heart") and intellectual adven ture (Egyptian "search of the heart"), emerged as part of an extraordinary expansion of the use of writing at the beginning of the second millennium B.C. and were written to be read out loud (like earlier oral poems). His analyses of passages from the "Lament of Kha kheper-ra-seneb," the "Prophecy of Neferti," and the "Admonition of Ipuwer," which he characterizes as "mytho-historical Problem Literature," are particularly striking, leading him to the conclusion that in them the "dark age" was represented as rooted in the divine plan for history, and that the distant past seems good, the fictional literary present bad, yet the future is ex pected to be good once more. Hans-W. Fischer-Elfert's interesting chapter con centrates on scribal reflections on their own literary past in Ramesside times. He discusses the corpus of earlier classics copied and read, the past literary he roes venerated, the reflections on the beauty of an cient monuments in visitors' graffiti (e.g., in the Step Pyramid complex) and their relationship to literature, and the kings whose doings, whether historical or mythical, were made subjects for literature. Especially fascinating is his analysis of the famous passage in P. Chester Beatty IV, which begins by commemorating "those learned scribes from the time of the successors of the gods" (p. 125) and denigrates contemporary literature by contrast with their works. In connec tion with the concluding words of the passage, he quotes a short spell in P. Athens National Library 1826, which is accompanied by a series of twenty-two crudely painted anthropomorphic figures identified by the names of ancient authors, and infers that the notion of magic was a fundamental criterion of litera ture in Ramesside times. Antonio Loprieno's study is concerned to establish a dichotomy between the treatment of the past in "literary" sources prior to c. 700 B.C. and that evident in subsequent compositions. He approaches his mate rial through "a history of 'memories' rather than of 'events' " (p. 140). He treats first the Manethonian tra dition and offers a challenging new analysis of the Hyksos and Osarseph narratives transmitted by Jose phus, concluding that Manetho "displays a binary ap proach to history" (p. 149). He proceeds to identify "the new historical consciousness" (p. 150) in the tales of Herodotus, in the "Book of the Temple," in Demotic stories, in the "Bentresh" and "Famine" ste lae and in the "Memphite Theology," and suggests that "[t]he actual present is not any more in monumental continuity with the past, as was the case during the Bronze Age, but rather critically divorced from it" (p. 152). Loprieno considers that this dichotomy can also be perceived in eighth-seventh century B.C. writ ings in other Mediterranean civilizations, notably in Greece with the transition from Homer to Hesiod, and in the Old Testament with the transition from the mythical "History of the Past" to the Deuteronomistic "History of the Present." This fascinating and original chapter is one of the highlights of the whole series. David O'Connor's chapter "Egypt's Views of 'Oth ers' " concerns Egyptian presentation of foreigners in texts and scenes, which he treats under three heads, "Actuality," "Ideology" and "Belief." Under each he shows that Egyptian experience of "the foreign" was varied and nuanced: foreigners might be "good" as trading partners or allies but "bad" as invaders and enemies; "good" if they acted according to divine order ("Maat"), "bad" if they rebelled and acted as a manifestation of chaos ("Met"); a "positive" force as part of the divinely-created cosmos, but a "negative" one as inhabiting the unknown and dangerous periph ery. However, as the Egyptian view was that cosmic re newal was an unending process embodying the victory of the forces of order over those of chaos as effected by the sun-god in the universe and by Pharaoh in this world, the images of the king triumphing over and destroying foreigners are those principally appropri ate to the temple and funerary scenes and texts that form the principal surviving evidence. O'Connor con cludes that: "The image of the foreigner and the for eign presented by ancient Egyptian sources seems kaleidoscopic, but this is due to the variety of contexts in which foreigners are represented. In reality, the Egyptian view of the foreign was integrated and com prehensive, and based upon a fundamental set of ideas" (p. 178). His chapter is a tour-de-force of com pression and balanced analysis that should act as a salutary corrective both to those who accept Egyptian sources uncritically and to those who dismiss Egyptian evidence out of hand because it sometimes reflects its ideological context. It is, however, of rather marginal relevance to the theme of this book, and might better have been placed in Mysterious Lands. Sally-Ann Ashton's first chapter deals critically with the terracotta heads that P?trie found in what he termed the "foreign quarter" of central Memphis and interpreted as "portraits" of foreigners, pro duced principally by Egyptian artists in the Late and Hellenistic Periods. Ashton's is the first re-examina tion of all the original heads. Her main conclusions are that the material is not a unity and was not found in a single datable archaeological context; that the heads exhibit wide differences of manufacturing</page><page sequence="6">178 JARCE XLI (2004) technique and style; that some of them belong to the Greek "Tanagra" tradition and probably date to the fourth?third centuries B.C., while others are certainly of Egyptian manufacture and range from the Thirti eth Dynasty down to the first century A.D.; and that, while a few of the heads may indeed represent "for eigners," many others probably represent priests or priestesses, actors, and dwarfs, or minor deities of the Bes type. These conclusions, though not entirely novel, seem reasonable. Her second chapter reconsid ers Ptolemaic royal statuary in Egyptian style in the context of "archaism." She believes that early Ptole maic "Egyptianizing" portraiture follows the tradi tions of the Thirtieth Dynasty, and that some of the statuary of Ptolemy VIII-X does so also, while two images of Ptolemaic queens of the third to second century B.C. show Eighteenth Dynasty influence. The present reviewer lacks the art historical expertise to criticize her challenging views, mercifully expressed without recourse to abstract terminology. David Jeffreys' paper "All in the Family? Heirlooms in Ancient Egypt" tackles a difficult subject rarely specifically addressed in Egyptological literature. He sensibly adopts a broader definition of "heirloom" than "personal memento." He discusses such cases as military arms, where the innate functional value of the piece may have been allied with prestige value; female property, which could be protected by formal contract; craft tools; ritual and magic objects; pottery and stone vessels, often mended in early times; and personal items, such as jewelry, scarabs, rings, and amulets. In general, he manifests a much more cau tious attitude than some towards the identification of heirlooms in the archaeological record. He also sug gests that: "Family burials and commemorative archi tecture, and indeed the physical remains and funerary accessories of the ancestors themselves, may in a cer tain sense have been bequeathed to succeeding gen erations" (p. 203), without, however, mentioning Late Period sales of tomb liturgies. While discussing the well-known "heirlooms" in the tomb of Tutankhamun, he suggests that this substitute tomb may only have been so amply provisioned as a makeshift alternative for the usual repertory of tomb-scenes that there had been no time to provide, and that therefore it should perhaps not be automatically assumed that other kings had equally or more splendid funerary provi sions, now lost through robbery. Whether this daring but intriguing hypothesis will meet with general ac claim seems doubtful, but overall this is a thoughtful and thought-provoking chapter. This valuable work extends and advances consid erably the study of the Ancient Egyptians' view of the past, and broadens and clarifies the definition and usage of the term "archaism." While much of the evi dence quoted has been previously published, varying critical methodologies elicit from it some challenging new interpretations and hypotheses, which should en gender new research. Inevitably the treatment of top ics is eclectic, and there are in this reviewer's opinion notable and surprising omissions, such as the constant re-use throughout Dynastic history of ancient texts in funerary compositions and the documentary evidence for the preservation of family genealogical and prop erty records over many generations. Ancient Egypt in Africa (H. S. Smith) This book falls into two parts, which its editors, David O'Connor and Andrew Reid, treat under the headings "Modern theories" and "Ancient realities" in their stimulating introduction. Their decision to place first the chapters concerning "how earlier theories about Ancient Egypt in Africa were shaped and dis torted by racial prejudice, colonial and imperial in terests and now outmoded scholarly ideas" (p. 1) is justified by their purpose, but here we give priority to the chapters principally concerned with ancient evidence. Kevin C. MacDonald's chapter on "Cheikh Anta Diop and Ancient Egypt in Africa" in fact combines both functions by considering "what role Diop saw "Black Egypt" playing in the peopling and cultural formation of sub-Saharan Africa" and comparing this "with data gleaned from the past century of archaeo logical enquiry" (p. 94), focusing principally on the Sahara and the Sahelo-Sudanic belt. MacDonald praises Diop for re-opening this subject and asking appropriate and unanswered questions, while draw ing attention to his use of outdated sources. In a review of the evidence from historical linguistics, he agrees with Diop that "black" peoples who were in Northern Africa at the beginning of the Holocene dis placed or integrated with autochthonous peoples of "Inner" Africa, but concludes that these incomers must have been speakers of Nilo-Saharan and/or Niger-Congo languages, not Afro-Asiatic speakers of Egyptian origin. Stylistic similarities in pottery indi cate maintenance of contacts between the Nile and the central Sahara and Niger/Chad basins from c. 9500-7000 B.P. (after which diversification indicates isolation), but there is no evidence for the import of cereal agriculture (wheat/barley) from Egypt into the Sahara regions until after 4500 B.P. and likewise no compelling technological similarities or dating pat terns to suggest connections between iron-working in W and central Africa and earlier metal-working</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 179 in Egypt. Egyptian Dynastic influence thus did not stretch W of the Saharan oases or beyond Jebel Moya in the southern Sudan, though there may have been a Trans-Saharan Pastoral Technocomplex from 3800 1000 B.C. David Wengrow, in his impressive chapter "The African Foundations of Ancient Egyptian Civiliza tion Reconsidered," dismisses the distinction made by "colonialist" scholars between the alleged "Ha mitic" peoples of the Lower/Middle Nile and "African peoples without a history." However, he sees value in the views of Frankfort on Ancient Egyptian king ship and Early Dynastic society and notes the "inabil ity of existing models of social evolution, developed principally in relation to the archaeological record of South West Asia, to account for the distinguish ing features of Egyptian political culture" (p. 125). He convincingly demonstrates from recent field-work in the Sixth Cataract area the close cultural community between the "Badarian" in Egypt and the "Khartoum Neolithic" in the central Sudan, both lacking perma nent villages, pursuing a mobile pastoral economy and sharing funerary practices and strikingly similar artifactual and ceramic complements. He strongly re jects (with Edwards and Fuller; see below) the view of many modern theoretical archaeologists that mobile pastoralists are incapable of forming powerful states and producing impressive monuments, quoting mod ern Nilotic examples and indicting this view as also rooted in the historical impact of colonialism. In their introduction O'Connor and Reid point out that Dy nastic contacts with "Inner Africa" were limited by the extreme aridity of the Sahara in the historical pe riod, but that the "commonalities" between Egyptian and Sudanese cultures identified by Wengrow may arise from conditions in Prehistoric times when the Sahara was moister and supported widespread, mo bile populations. They also intriguingly suggest that these Prehistoric "commonalities" may lie behind the type of internally varied "commonality" in conceptual relationships running through many of the modern societies of sub-Saharan Africa that Michael Rowlands posits in his brilliant chapter "The Unity of Africa." Rowlands' argument (too complex for summary here) arises from the pervasive African notion of "con tainment." The human body is a "container" of power ful substances and can be manipulated to attract external forces to come and inhabit it; the bodies of chiefs and kings are ritually empowered "contain ers" for ancestral and material substances dispersed to subjects for them to absorb; such chiefs unify in themselves two contradictory principles normally kept separate, in that they combine life-giving forces with the power to kill. While O'Connor and Reid echo Rowlands' warning concerning the methodological difficulties of comparison due to time difference, they rightly emphasize the striking similarities here with the conceptual framework and ritual practices of Egyptian kingship, so different from those held in the Ancient Near East. Rowlands' fascinating and chal lenging thesis should certainly be studied by all Egyp tologists, Sudanologists, and Africanists. Robert G. Morkot's chapter discusses the idea that the inception of the Napatan (Kushite) kingdom came about through the agency of Egyptian priests of Amun who emigrated from Thebes under internal pres sures during the Third Intermediate Period. He traces this notion, which has never been supported by any firm textual or archaeological evidence, from its nineteenth century origin to its rejection in the mid twentieth century, followed by its recent revival, stig matizing the "colonialist" and "racist" ideas that under lay the hypothesis and the dearth of well-researched criticism. He shows how Reisner's pioneer interpreta tion of the succession and chronology of royal burials at el-Kurru, based on "historical" assumptions rather than on building-history and artifact-study, distorted the problem and how it is now being preserved by treating Late New Kingdom objects and pottery found at Kurru as "heirlooms." Hopefully this valuable ar ticle will result in analytical archaeological work that will finally lay this unsupported hypothesis to rest, and validate the indigenous origin of the Napatan king dom in the Kerma culture that is suggested by the rap idly accumulating evidence from recent field-work. The aim of David N. Edwards' chapter is to develop a "Sudanic" model for the interpretation of the social, economic and political organization of the Napatan (Kushite) and later kingdoms of the Sudan. Though he acknowledges that the Napatan/Meroitic states made considerable cultural borrowings from Ancient Egypt, Edwards argues that the present picture of these kingdoms has been mainly constructed from an Egyptological viewpoint and regards them as be longing to a completely different, inherently African cultural complex. He advocates new research into ba sic phenomena like "subsistence," cattle, and selectiv ity in imported goods, and he examines the "culinary" culture of Napata and Meroe, identifying a sharp con trast between an Egyptian economy based on wheat and barley and that of the Middle Nile based on sor ghum and millet cultivation, savannah grazing and herding. In support, he emphasizes the social, politi cal and funerary roles of feasting and especially of beer-drinking in modern Africa and adduces ancient parallels. While his interesting approach should pro duce new insights, the difference he proposes with Egypt, where feasting and beer-drinking probably</page><page sequence="8">180 JARCE XLI (2004) had a similar symbolic role in festivals, ceremonials, and funerary rites, is not proven. Dorian Q. Fuller's purpose in "Pharaonic or Sudanic? Models for Meroitic Society and Change" is the same as that of Edwards. The "Sudanic" model that they both use is based upon the anthropologi cal concept of the "segmentary state," defined by four aspects: (i) numerous centers of political power; (ii) dif ferentiation between royal suzerainty and the practi cal power of local ?lites; (iii) separate administrative and coercive systems at the central and local levels; (iv) fluctuation in size, especially at the spatial peripher ies. Fuller uses this model to interpret trade through Nubia as part of a prestige goods economy, focused on gift-giving designed to create and maintain Meroitic ideological power, and suggests clever resolutions of three historical debates over: (i) the alleged Meroitic Ptolemaic "condominium" in the Dodekaschoenos; (ii) the involvement of the Meroitic Wayekiye clan there in the third century A.D.; (iii) alleged northern "auton omy." However, in this reviewer's opinion, the socio political organization of Pharaonic Egypt at various times shared more with the "segmented state" model he uses for Nubia than with the quasi-imperialistic model he sets out for Dynastic Egypt. The remaining chapters concern modern histori cal concepts and theories, and the use made of them for racial and political purposes. Martin Bernal's essay succinctly summarizes the arguments of his now fa mous book Black Athena, in which he differentiated an "Ancient Model" of the rise of civilization in Greece, emphasizing the part played by the Egyptians and Phoenicians, from an "Aryan Model" of a northern conquest by Indo-European-speaking Hellenes, which was developed by western scholars in the 1830s and 1840s. The idea that the Egyptians who brought civi lization to Greece had been black Africans, adopted by Bernai himself and by Afrocentrists and others, was first introduced into the "Ancient Model" by French scholars in the late eighteenth?early nine teenth century. As the skin-color of the Ancient Egyp tians is not (being a biological issue) treated in this book, the principal relevance of Bernal's thesis to it is his account of the philosophical and "racist" back ground of nineteenth and twentieth century historiog raphy. In his "Reflections on Black Athena" John A. North stresses that much of the main argument of Bernal's first volume is acceptable to most ancient historians. His main criticisms are that Bernai is oper ating with an outmoded concept of race, and that his method, essentially a simplistic option for the "Ancient Model" against the "Aryan Model" on the grounds that the latter is corrupted by "colonialism" and "racism," involves for ancient historians the total rejection of the validity of their methods of source criticism. Andrew Reid's chapter "Ancient Egypt and the Source of the Nile" gives a highly instructive and en tertaining account of the explorers, stressing their employment of the discredited "Hamitic" hypothesis, of indigenous African oral traditions of foreign ori gins and of the alleged similarities between modern African artifacts and Ancient Egyptian artifacts to "prove" that the Great Lakes civilizations originated somehow from Ancient Egypt. He concludes "this chapter has discovered little about the history of Af rica (Egypt included) but much about the concepts of Africa and of Egypt, as they were constructed by Europeans" (p. 76), and warns that: "Most worryingly, ideas generated by explorers, missionaries and admin istrators in the late 19th century can be seen to be be hind many of the academic interpretations of African history in the 20th century" (p. 55). Reid's message thus echoes that of many others in this series. Bruce S. Bennett's paper on "Ancient Egypt, Missionaries and Christianity in Southern Africa" is in much the same vein, though he shows how missionaries' views of the role of Egypt in the formation of Southern African cultures differed from those of secular schol ars, and how Christianized Africans' understanding of the Bible frequently depicts Egypt as a symbolic lo cation representing sin. Caleb A. Folorunso gives a succinct historical account of changing views of An cient Egypt as the source of civilization in West Africa, ranging from the accounts of Arab historians and other sources of visits by "Pharaohs" to West Africa to the gradual recognition, not complete until the 1980s, that West African development had been in dependent of Egypt. Folorunso next discusses oral traditions among the Yoruba and other West African peoples that they originated in the East, observing that many of these myths only emerged under colo nialism and proclaimed common origin to foster po litical unity. He then briefly rehearses the arguments of Diop, Bernai, Diagne, Obenga, and others that the Ancient Egyptians were black Africans, observing that: "Many of the current discussions appear to be characterized by abuse and by accusations of Afrocen trism" (p. 90). Folorunso's balanced and sensible conclusion well summarizes the rejection of past theorizing and the laudable future strategy of collaborative research ad vocated in this challenging and thought-provoking book, which should be required reading for Egyptol ogists and Africanists alike. For although the evi dence is simply inadequate either to support or to deny some of the hypotheses currently being promul gated, it is the duty of scholars to set out the facts that</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 181 can be established and allowable inferences in a form that can be assimilated by the general reader. For these readers this book is an admirable introduc tion, but they should be warned that (inevitably) it lacks any first-hand re-analysis of the Egyptian textual sources, relying on secondary works. Less understand ably, it gives no account of the totally new under standing of the richness, power and geographical extent of the Nubian Kerma-cultures of the third and second millennia B.C. generated by recent archaeo logical work. These discoveries emphasize that better understanding of Ancient Egypt's role in Africa will only be gained through archaeological, anthropologi cal and linguistic work in Africa and more acute comparative analysis of Egyptian textual and repre sentational sources. Ancient Perspectives on Egypt (Dorothy J. Thompson) A wide-ranging introduction from the editors, Roger Matthews and Cornelia Roemer, lays out the themes of this volume, which is primarily concerned with outsiders' views of Egypt from the start of the third millennium B.C. to the fourth century A.D. The following studies are characterized as those based primarily on archaeology and those in which written sources come first. Which of these predominates de pends on the period concerned, with perspectives pre-1500 B.C. (chapters 2-4) inevitably more based on archaeology. The volume as a whole provides a coun terpoint in evidence and perspective. In both archae ological and historical terms, a strong claim is made for the importance of placing earlier Egypt within its broader geographical context. This broad approach is a helpful one, though the problem of knowing what anyone thought from material remains alone remains intractable. Speculation is often the best we can do (see p. 8 on the possible "terror and abhorrence" of the native peoples of "Punt" towards the Egyptians to their north or the ambitious model on p. 20). Yet even the arresting claim that: "Thoughts of people are to some extent detached from archaeological material, whereas in texts we trace their memories, fears and astonishment" (p. 11) is modified in the following paragraphs. Literary texts like Herodotus or Horace represent just one form of account; the documentary record of papyri is very different. And even with writ ten texts their silences are often greater than what they tell. They too need supplementation; art and buildings can help fill in the picture. Chapters 2-4 are concerned with archaeological material and what this can tell of what others thought of Egypt. In "South Levantine Encounters with An cient Egypt at the Beginning of the Third Millen nium" Eliot Braun provides a detailed site-by-site coverage of the subject. Perspectives are less easy to evaluate: "The significance of this material in deter mining the nature of encounters by local people with Egypt in the early phases of EB I is open to discus sion" (p. 33); "The present evidence is scanty and capable of producing equivocal interpretations" (p. 35). Such honesty is refreshing and a good case is made for a major settlement of Egyptians at Tell es Sakan where settlers may have played a key role in spreading Egyptian goods and knowledge. Stone vessels next take center stage with studies by Rachael Thyrza Sparks on "Egyptian Stone Vessels and the Politics of Exchange (2617-1070 B.C.)" and Andrew Bevan on stone vessels in their social con texts for "Reconstructing the Role of Egyptian Cul ture in the Value Regimes of the Bronze Age Aegean." If both "politics of exchange" and Bronze Age "value regimes" have a somewhat contemporary ring, the study of these long-lasting containers is found to be problematic in the extreme. Sparks is concerned with how stone vessels may have changed hands and what conclusions can be drawn from the surviving pattern. How far can cartouches be used for dating, given the activities of ancient tomb robbers who may well have supplied the ancient antiquities trade? Problems are regularly highlighted, but in the end the hypothesis tends to turn into the conclusion, with diplomatic contact presented as crucial to exchange. Bevan grap ples with many of the same problems?earlier vessels found in later contexts and local differences in both taste and patterns of survival. Imitation and importa tion (of both contemporary vessels and antiques) may have played a role in the spread of these objects, and the adoption of the sailing ship in the third millen nium was of crucial importance in changing horizons and patterns of contact (p. 58). What these contacts can actually tell of perceptions remains hypothetical. A useful tabulation of chronologies in the areas dis cussed (p. 73) is an essential aid to a discussion that ranges widely over the Aegean while centered on Crete. Again no answers are clear but the questions asked are certainly worth raising. The importance of the wider context in understanding the pattern of what survives is the main demonstration of this study. So far archaeology has raised questions rather than provided answers but with the introduction of Hittite sources ("Love and War in the Late Bronze Age: Egypt and Hatti") David Warburton weaves a nar rative of relations between two major powers. Based primarily on literary and documentary sources, with some support from material remains (especially for Kadesh), this account would appear to represent a</page><page sequence="10">182 JARCE XLI (2004) somewhat personal view of the period in which the problems of interpretation of the intriguing docu mentation that lies behind the narrative are barely glimpsed by the reader (see p. 92 on the treaty be tween Hattushili and Ramesses II or p. 98 on corre spondence in Akkadian between the two courts). In the following chapter by Warburton and Roger Matthews, the main theme of the volume is more in evidence, as is the basis of the study. "Egypt and Mesopotamia in the Late Bronze and Iron Ages" shows well the different strengths and modes of action of the protagonists while introducing the complexi ties and problems of the (mainly written) source mate rial on which this historical overview depends. This was an international world with several key players employing a wide range of languages. Different lan guages, scripts, and loan words illustrate local practices and the process of change. The presence in Amarna of native Babylonian scribes teaching Akkadian to Egyptian officials is an intriguing if unverifiable sug gestion. In conclusion the authors attempt?with lim ited success?to bring this wide-ranging study (from Assyria to Alexander!) back to the subject of Perspec tives. Relations between Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria remain the focus of this fascinating chapter. In "Finding the Egyptian in Early Greek Art" the prime aim of Jeremy Tanner is to understand and ex plain the links between Greeks and Egypt that can be detected in a range of materials and art forms. His concern is with both material culture and the possible range of theoretical approaches to its interpretation. His preferred (and argued) approach is to employ world systems analysis within a Mediterranean context and to this end he ranges over bronze and marble sculpture, faience, and monumental temple architec ture. The survival patterns of Greek sanctuaries, the identification and location of the artists involved and the various processes of communication and cul tural transfer are all discussed. His account of con tacts between Egypt and Greece in the seventh to fifth centuries B.C. as shown in the material record pro vides a masterly survey. Memphis and Naucratis are suggested as key points of contact for the adoption of the Egyptian "grid" and canon of proportions. And in affirming the fundamental importance to develop ments in Greece of Egyptian architectural and artistic technologies he argues for the integration of Greek city-states into a broader Eastern Mediterranean cul ture of monumentality. Once again it is this wider world within which change is to be charted and best understood. The discussion by Thomas Harrison of the Greek historian Herodotus and Greek encounters with Egypt is a complex one. Its title, "Upside Down and Back to Front," is a good description of his own analysis in which interpretations (like the use of polar ity as a tool for understanding) are presented and then deflated. Harrison makes the interesting sugges tion that the length of Herodotus' Egyptian section may be explained by the cataclysmic effect of Camby ses' conquest but, in terms of the main subject of this volume, his frank conclusion on Inaros' revolt might well be applied more generally: "What impact this episode might have had on Greek perceptions of Egypt as distinct from Persia is impossible to assess" (p. 146). Texts are again at the base of chapter nine, where Csaba A. La'da uses contemporary papyri from within Egypt to illuminate the experience of those Helle nistic Greeks who ruled Egypt in the three hundred years following Alexander's conquest. The two spheres of interaction between the main ethnic groups that he finds?official and private?are precisely those of the documents. His discussion of the role of ethnicity, however, and of the nature of the Ptolemaic state discriminatory or otherwise?starts not from texts but from models. Earlier interpretations are placed for evaluation in their historiographical context and his conclusion is that differences between Greeks and Egyptians arose from economic inequality more than discrimination. For La'da under Ptolemaic rule: "(A) free and largely non-discriminatory social atmosphere facilitated a lively and intensive exchange of ideas, cultures and also genetic material between Greeks and Egyptians" (p. 167). There was indeed some inter marriage; that documented is almost all between Greek males and Egyptian females. In a few pages the author provides a clear characterization of a chang ing picture of ethnic fortunes, though his somewhat optimistic conclusion ignores the fact that, in the third century B.C. at least, "Hellenes" enjoyed a privi leged tax-status. If in the end the discussion is con cerned more with state policy and the situation on the ground than with perceptions and perspectives that at least forms a necessary preliminary to the wider subject. In chapter ten Ian Rutherford considers "Pilgrim age in Greco-Roman Egypt" through a fresh look at graffiti from the Memnonion at Abydos. The Mem nonion lay in an area peripheral to the main Abydos temple and served in many roles throughout its long life. In the Hellenistic Period besides being a place of pilgrimage it apparently served as a barracks as well as a tomb of Memnon, a temple of Serapis and (later) an oracle of Bes. Most pilgrims, Rutherford claims, were soldiers from a limited area around it. The wider perspective of this study is an encounter with religion but it is only tangentially concerned with the volume's</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 183 main theme. As in the previous chapter, the author's main concern is with the experience of Greeks (or at least those writing Greek) in Egypt. The distinction between pilgrim and casual visitor is never fully re solved but the varying location of different forms of graffito allows Rutherford to attempt to evaluate their significance. The link he makes between different lan guage inscriptions and sense of identity must remain extremely tentative but his suggestion that periph eral temples regularly served as places of pilgrimage is compelling. Graffiti are followed by mosaics and in Susan Walker's impressive chapter "Carry-on at Canopus" Nilotic mosaics are placed within the cultural context of Rome's view of Egypt and its inhabitants in the Late Republican and Early Imperial Periods. The land of the Nile with its inundation and peculiar fauna together with its dissolute inhabitants are shown through Roman eyes. Suggesting a date under Cleo patra for the Palestrina mosaic, Walker accepts this as a record of the Khoiakh festival of the Nile. Elsewhere pygmies (found even in the Delta) fight hippopotamus and crocodile rather than Homer's cranes. It is the ex otic and licentious image of Egypt that is portrayed in this art form, which may often have had a political purpose. Through careful visual analysis changing perspectives are presented for consideration. The ar gument here is lively and convincing; it forms a high light of this volume. Finally, in a survey of Roman literature from the first to the fourth centuries A.D., Herwig Maehler charts changing views of Egypt on the part of the Romans. In the first century A.D., as is well known, the propaganda of Octavian, later Augustus, was re sponsible for a negative image of Egypt and, par ticularly, its oriental queen. Although by the end of the century the obsession with Cleopatra may have subsided somewhat, popular prejudices about ef feminate Egyptians and their animal cults lived on (see Juvenal). As in mosaics, Canopus was the locus of licentiousness par excellence. There was no attempt at serious understanding of Egypt and the Egyptians. With Apuleius, however, some (minimal) knowledge of Egyptian cult may be traced. Some intriguing com ments on statuary end this overview. Written texts and material culture once again come together to illumi nate Ancient Perspectives on Egypt. This book, then, contains some fine individual chapters, but certain others have rather marginal rele vance to the main theme or are inconclusive owing to the nature of their subject matter. While it is un realistic to demand comprehensiveness in so broad a survey, certain omissions stand out, for instance the lack of a study of the reactions of Levantine states to Egypt in the fourteenth century B.C. based on the Amarna letters, or of those of rulers of Napata (Kush) in the eighth century B.C. onwards as recorded in the stelae of Piankhi and his successors. The Wisdom of Egypt: changing visions through the ages (Dorothy J. Thompson) This book, edited by Peter Ucko and Timothy Champion, must form one of the least familiar and most intriguing of all these Encounters. It is striking how many of the contributions to this volume start by claiming that their subject has not been treated before. What was known of Ancient Egypt in the Classical Period, in Europe and the Arabic worlds through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the Early Modern Period is here presented and placed in context. The fascinating picture that emerges is complex and changing. As a whole, this volume makes for compelling reading. First comes the editors' introduction on "Egypt Ancient and Modern." In an arresting overview of Egypt and its history in the context of the wider east ern and Mediterranean world from Alexander to the present, Ucko and Champion outline the highlights and approaches of the contributions that follow. Egypt is presented as an idea, an inspiration, a myth and a reality. How far is the Legacy of Egypt (the title of an earlier study) based on real knowledge? How far is it just "a label," and "why did the magic of Egypt. . . enter the bloodstream of the west and remain there?" (p. 22). A masterly thumbnail sketch of changing real ities and roles places Egypt between East and West and often at the center of each. This is "Reception Studies" at its best. In his treatment of classical views of "The Wisdom of Egypt," John Tait surveys the systematic and wide ranging nature of the "wisdom literature" of Egypt and of the priestly writings that derived from temple contexts. Classical authors frequently made use of Egyptian themes but showed little interest in the Egyptian people. "Wisdom" belonged to Egypt and the Egyptians; this was an inward-looking view of knowledge for home consumption. Okasha El Daly then provides a new picture of "Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings." Between the Classical Period and the European Renaissance he charts a long and full tradition of interest in Ancient Egypt. The details are often intriguing. In the ninth century Ibn Tulun is reported to have unearthed four thousand kilograms of pharaonic gold; the system of excavation permits he subsequently imposed has a familiar ring. The lighthouse of Alexandria was illus trated by Al-Gharnati in the twelfth century and in the</page><page sequence="12">184 JARCE XLI (2004) fourteenth century an interest in alchemy brought temples, Egyptian deities and holy sites to the fore. Those aspiring to senior posts with the Sultan were in the habit of visiting the Sphinx on a certain day in the year; the site was one of international vene ration throughout the Medieval Period. Ceremonies were centered at other sites, with a "Night of Fire" on top of the Great Pyramid; the Serapeum at Mem phis (Saqqara) still served as a site of pilgrimage, with the "Prison of Joseph" located at Abu Sir. Egyptian scripts were much discussed, though Coptic alone was known. This is an important introduction to the nature and content of medieval Arabic sources that adds immensely to our knowledge of the period. Meanwhile in the West, as we learn from Charles Burnett in chapter four, a multi-faceted Egypt held the field. In a lively discussion, Burnett introduces the changing images of Egypt in geography, ethnography, and travelers' reports. The Egypt of medieval Chris tianity was that of the Old Testament. As always, the scripts and languages of Egypt exercised their fasci nation in this period. Above all, however, Egypt was the home of magic. Nectanebo was known from the Alexander Romance; Ptolemy the king and Ptolemy author of the Tetrabiblos were often held to be the same. With the re-discovery of Horapollo and the Corpus Hermeticum in the fifteenth century a fascina tion with Egypt was on occasion replaced by Egyp tomania. A wealth of information and clarity in exposition distinguish this rich discussion and the different visions of Egypt, depending on the status and identity of the individual involved, are neatly summarized in conclusion. The Renaissance afterlife of Ancient Egypt, ana lyzed by Brian A. Curran in chapter five, picks up on much of the previous chapter. Although the impor tance of the "hermetic revival" for early modern phi losophy and science has been recognized, the broader significance of the reception of Ancient Egypt, he ar gues, needs further consideration, especially since the self-proclaimed Egyptian specialists of the time seem so often to have got it wrong. (The term "Egyp tologist," we later learn (p. 180), is first found in 1859, "Egyptology" in 1862.) A degree of scholarly decep tion was involved in the interpretation of Egypt?in language studies (especially the "idea" of hieroglyphs), the understanding of monuments (obelisks in Rome were "Roman") and in the reconstruction of the past. The use of Egypt in the history of his native land by Annius of Viterbo involved the creation of "ancient" texts for use with those of classical writers; such "evi dence" was then backed up by "re-discovered" tablets and works of art. According to Annius (p. 112), follow ing the Great Flood, King Osiris (also known as Apis and a descendant through Cham of Noah) was called to Italy to rid the country of cannibalistic giants. With the help of his son Hercules the Egyptian, Osiris was victorious. He ruled in Viterbo for ten years before returning to Egypt and a struggle with Typhon (or Seth). With such fantasies local pride was enhanced and patrons pleased. In alchemy, too, Egypt contin ued its central role. In the seventeenth century Cal vinist Casaubon at least showed some degree of skepticism; the hermetic writings, he claimed, were the product of a late antique impostor, not genuine Egyptian doctrines from the time of Moses. Casaubon, however, was far from the mainstream that was repre sented rather by the influential (Jesuit) Egyptologist Athanasius Kircher, whose many publications did much to develop a discipline still dominated by the riddle of the sphinx and the mystery of Egypt's sacred writings. In seventeenth and eighteenth century England, as shown by David Boyd Haycock in chapter six, Egyp tology was still intimately connected with religion. As long as biblical chronology formed an unchallenged strait-jacket, scholars struggled with accounts of An cient Egypt. Hieroglyphs, still undeciphered despite Kircher's claims, formed a "tantalizing veil" beneath which Egypt itself lay hidden. In 1717, when the first Freemasons' Lodge was built, the tradition was traced back to Noah through the tower of Babel and the Egyptian pyramids. In the same year Bishop Huet claimed the Egyptians as founders of the civilizations of India and China. Egypt as origin loomed large at this time. Links were made with the Druids, and in the ground plan of Avebury in 1743 Stukeley saw a hieroglyphic figure of a winged serpent penetrating a circle, interpreted as a representation of the Trinity. Newton was happy to present his views in ancient dress; the Ancient Egyptians, he claimed, had under stood the heliocentric system while disseminating this knowledge "under the veil of religious rites and hiero glyphick symbols" (p. 142). But some were beginning to question this veil. Already in 1620 Francis Bacon had claimed that "the discovery of things is to be taken from the light of nature, not recovered from the shadows of antiquity" (p. 142); he still gave the Sphinx an allegorical meaning. Egypt was hard to escape and relations with the ancient civilizations (and biblical history) remained a constant concern. Finally we reach the nineteenth and twentieth cen tury where, in "Beyond Egyptology," Timothy Cham pion traces the role of Egypt in the new disciplines of archaeology and anthropology. Napoleon's cap ture of Egypt with the subsequent decipherment of hieroglyphs marked a turning point. At the same time, developments in scientific method, in historical lin guistics and forms of classification presented Egypt in a new light. In a move from concerns with chronology</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS 185 to ethnology Egypt was seen as the common cultural and physical origin for all humankind. For Prichard in 1813 Ancient Egyptians were negroid in type (like Hindus) with woolly hair and black in color; by 1826, with the study of mummies, their color had be come "chocolate or red copper" (p. 165). In North America Egyptians soon served as an "Urvolk" for blacks, whites and even native Americans. Egypt was further seen to provide a positive exemplar for black achievement. The need for an acceptable an cient origin is the driving force in a story that still has resonance. Cranial measurement (see the amazing reproduction of royal types on p. 173), the analysis of hair and the study of ancient images all had their role in changing views; their results were not univer sally accepted. For John Stuart Mill in 1850 there were no doubts: "The earliest known civilization was, we have the strongest reason to believe, a negro civiliza tion. The original Egyptians are inferred, from the evi dence of their sculptures, to have been a negro race; it was from the negroes, therefore, that the Greeks learnt their first lessons in civilization" (p. 177). The recent claims found in Martin Bernal's Black Athena represent a return to earlier debates; here they figure just briefly (pp. 102 and 183). Egypt entered other disciplines. For Weber and others, Egypt played a part in studies of political organization and social differentiation in the pre-industrial state. Archaeology and the study of languages and writing ran hand in hand. Chairs of Egyptology were founded in several universities; that at University College, London (1892) was the first. But whereas in the first third of the twen tieth century Egypt was still seen as the origin of world civilization it has now been supplanted in this posi tion. Champion ends with an expression of surprise at how slight the role played by Egypt is in new ar chaeological developments and current comparative work on culture, urbanism, anthropology and histori cal sociology. Could it be, he asks, that the discipline is becoming somewhat insular? Or is there some more interesting reason? Views of Ancient Egypt since Napoleon Bonaparte: imperialism, colonialism and modern appropriations (Sue Davies) This volume follows on naturally from the rich tap estry of The Wisdom of Egypt, picking up several of the same threads and weaving them into a continuing picture. The title of the editor's introduction, "Two Hundred Years of Ancient Egypt: Modern History and Ancient Archaeology," admirably sums up its con tents. In one masterly sweep David Jeffreys touches upon a huge range of issues: Bonaparte's expedition, the emergence of Mohammed Ali in the early 1800s, the resultant establishment of large numbers of Brit ish and French personnel in Egypt, the policies of the Khedives during the nineteenth century, the setting up by Mariette, in the 1850s, of the Service des Antiq uities de l'Egypte, the British occupation, the govern ment licensing system, the pattern of concessions, the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, and the curtailment of foreign activities following Egyp tian independence in 1952 and the Suez crisis in 1956. He discusses the effects of these events on the emer gence of Egyptology as an academic discipline and on the development of a frame of reference for archaeo logical field-work, effects that have often had far from fortunate results. He notes the seeming paradox be tween the relative isolation of the subject academically speaking and its massive popular appeal, and con cludes that the lack of an inclusive, coherent discur sive framework for the study of Ancient Egypt and its resultant susceptibility to marginal views may have left it more open to specific appropriations than most other ancient societies. The Afrocentrist movement in the U.S. is one such appropriation, and Jeffreys has some insightful remarks to make here, not only with regard to the exponents of the movement, but also on the reactions of the West and of the traditional academic community. The reaction of the Egyptians to the Afrocentrist claim raises the issue of how Egypt views its own pre-Islamic past and provokes comment on the development of Egyptology within Egypt itself since independence. Jeffreys concludes with a ques tion: "In the spirit of self-enquiry that a book like this both stimulates and requires, it is worth asking what the role of the modern archaeologist or historian of Egypt is, or should be, in a postcolonial world" (p. 17). His chapter should be compulsory reading for all ar chaeologists and historians of Egypt and is especially pertinent to anyone intending to pursue field-work within the country. The ensuing chapters of the book are less wide ranging than the introduction, being concerned with specificities. Jeffreys' contribution is a hard act to follow, but Fekri A. Hassan manages it with character istic aplomb in his (lavishly illustrated) case-study of "the appropriation of archaeological monuments by colonial powers in order to canonize their world hegemony" (p. 19). He examines the history of appro priating obelisks (not only by colonial powers) and the probable rationale for such undertakings "in or der to develop a historically grounded opinion on how archaeological heritage ought to be managed in a globalized world" (p. 20). We are given a highly enjoy able, readable and informative account of appropria tors of obelisks, beginning with the Roman Emperors and ending with the independent Egyptian state in the middle of the last century (can you appropriate</page><page sequence="14">186 JARCE XLI (2004) your own past? yes, I believe so), and of the motives behind the appropriations, but this reviewer is still rather in the dark regarding Hassan's opinion on how archaeological heritage ought to be managed in a glo balized world. Like Hassan's contribution, Morris L. Bierbrier's chapter is concerned with the attempt on the part of those in power and authority to legitimize and glo rify their position through architecture and through the commissioning or acquisition of monuments and works of art. If you read Hassan's chapter you should also read Bierbrier's, for the latter forms a nicely crafted and balanced counterpoise to the pectoral col lar of the former. In conclusion Bierbrier notes that the differing approaches on the part of certain gov ernments in the past to the principle of art and an tiquities for government's sake are still reflected in the treatment of the respective national cultural organiza tions in Egypt to this day. His argument specifically concerns the French and British national efforts; but the point he makes can be extended, and it may be hoped that government personnel from a wider range of nations concerned with and for the cultural reputa tions of their countries will read what he has to say and reflect on it. In chapter four, Jason Thompson gives us an ac count of the contribution made to Egyptology by Sir William Gell (of whom this reviewer was ignorant and who deserves to be remembered), and in chapter five certain British military personnel based in Egypt fol lowing the war of 1882 are given their spot of lime light by David M. Dixon in his Egyptological sidelights on that campaign. In chapter six, Jos?-R. P?rez-Accino and Covadonga Sevilla Cueva present some of Spain's encounters with Ancient Egypt, including the intrigu ing case of the finds from Cerro de los Santos and the forgeries of Vicente Juan Amat. Whichever ordi nal number one chooses, this was certainly not a close encounter?but it reads rather like a detective story, both from the point of view of "who-dunn-what" and with regard to the psychological insights it provides into human nature. Chapter seven "examines the ways in which both Ancient Egypt and Egyptology served as a powerful reference/model for the investigation and interpre tation of Mesoamerican prehispanic remains during the early 19th century" (p. 108). It also attempts to explain the rationale behind this, which leads its au thor, Isabel Medina-Gonz?lez, to make some thought provoking comments on the political dimensions, imperialist/expansionist frameworks, and intellectual constructs involved on both sides of the Atlantic. The views of men such as Carlos de Siguenza y G?ngora, Alexander Von Humboldt, and William Bullock, to which the reader is introduced in chapter seven, form a nice introduction to Timothy Champion's contribu tion in chapter eight, entitled "Egypt and the Diffu sion of Culture." Champion traces the fortunes of the "heliolithic" school of thought and the theory of hy perdiffusionism, the main proponents of which were G Elliot Smith and W J. Perry. One of the avenues for this theory was the anatomy circle at University Col lege London, which drew into its ambit men like H. J. Massingham, V. Gordon Childe and S. H. Hooke. This theory is now largely ignored or marginalized and is often regarded as inseparable from the lunatic fringe. But Champion notes that its proponents were highly regarded and very influential in their time, and asks what were the reasons for the power and popu larity of their ideas. His search for an answer to this question, which forms a finale to the chapter and con stitutes its most interesting part, takes up the threads of and expands on one of his opening remarks, that the hyperdiffusionist approach "was not just an aca demic conceit, but a vision of the past that caught the public imagination. It was very much a product of its time . . . and the idea of human history that it pro jected had a particular appeal, especially in the decade after World War I" (p. 127). Jane Rowlandson's interesting contribution on approaching the peasantry of Greco-Roman Egypt (chapter nine) is a model of succinct scholarship and a further salutary reminder, if one were needed, that we are all products of our own times and that our interpretations are unavoidably colored by our own experiences. However, this need not be viewed as a to tally negative phenomenon, for, as Rowlandson notes, if postcolonialism means "that no one can now pre tend to work on the history of Ancient Egypt in inno cence of the fact that their underlying assumptions (however unconscious) and interpretations will carry implications for the present day, the sense of respon sibility this engenders also encourages awareness of the potential for collaboration across the traditional disciplinary (and cultural and linguistic) boundaries" (p. 150). This might be a plug for the series of books here under review. In chapter ten, Mary Horbury approaches the Cop tic question rather less succinctly and considers how the issues of race and religion have dominated the approach to Coptic studies at the expense of other, equally valid, concerns. Chapter eleven, by Sandra A. Scham, is concerned with "the archaeology of the dis enfranchised," a concept unfamiliar to this reviewer, who was relieved to find an explanation of the term within the pages of this contribution.

The same may be said of David Wengrow's clever and chal lenging paper on republican values and the study of the ancient orient (chapter twelve), which concludes the volume. The title of the chapter fails to convey the scope of this contribution, which begins by con sidering the French Revolution, the toppling of the Ancien R?gime, the establishment of republican values in France and the effect these exerted on the ap proach to the study of Ancient Egypt in the wake of Napoleon's occupation of the country, and ends with an exploration of the ongoing debate as to the im portance of oriental influence in the ancient Mediter ranean (not to mention the less than ancient West) and the conduits along which such influence has flowed (together with the strength and direction of the various cross-currents). This extremely interesting and very able paper provides fruitful new insights on the concepts of "orientalization" and "orientalism" and also raises many questions. Like a perfect ban quet, it left this reviewer wanting more?food for thought indeed. Before moving on to the next book in the series, it is, perhaps, worth considering whether, in the twenty second century A.D., a volume will appear entitled Views of Ancient Egypt since "Encounters with Ancient Egypt": post-imperialism, post-colonialism, independence, nationalism and even more modern appropriations, and what its contents might be. Consuming Ancient Egypt (Sue Davies) The present reviewers were not overly enthusiastic at the prospect of reading this volume. The reviewer to whose lot it eventually fell began on the introduc tion by the editors, Michael Rice and Sally Mac Donald, with reluctance and read: "What other academic discipline concerned with the ancient world would be represented by an explicit linkage with 'consumerism'. ... It is this very direct relationship between Egypt, the scholars who study the evidence of its past, and the lay public that produces this sin gular conjunction: sometimes, 'confrontation' may seem a better word ... no other academic discipline is obliged to maintain such a degree of dialogue with the lay public. What should be the scholar's response to this public invasion of his or her domain? Indif ference, dismissal, cautious acceptance? Perhaps, more perceptively, a degree of recognition is called for, if only because of the validity of the interest and enthu siasm expressed by members of society who have no professional involvement or responsibility" (pp. 1-2). After consuming a cup of coffee and a large piece of humble pie this reviewer settled down on the sofa and began Consuming Ancient Egypt in earnest. In chapter two Carter Lupton considers "mummy mania," recognizing that "much of the lay person's "familiarity" with Egypt and its mummies derives from popular fiction and film" (p. 23). Not all readers will wish to accompany Lupton as he traces the liter ary, dramatic, cinematic, televisual, commercial, and pop legacy of the mummy (though "Fruity Yummy Mummy cereal" and "Mummies and Deadies" might bring a smile to the crustiest of old academic lips), but, as he remarks, for some Egyptologists, such films and stories were doubtless an early source of interest in the subject and "they may even spark the interest of some of the Egyptologists of tomorrow" (p. 46). Egyptologists of today, especially those engaged in teaching young people, may find themselves better prepared if, like a good general, they familiarize them selves with the disposition of troops on the field as a whole, or, if you prefer a cinematic metaphor, if they try "sleeping with the enemy" (or even sleeping with mummy). Chapter three by Jean-Marcel Humbert, which may appeal to Musicologists more than Egyptologists, looks at stagings of Verdi's opera Aida, and chapter four by Covadonga Sevilla Cueva deals with Vicent Lle?'s operetta La Corte de Fara?n. In chapter five, Sam Serafy considers Egypt in Hollywood and discusses three epic films of the 1950s, The Egyptian, Land of the Pharaohs and The Ten Commandments. He makes the telling observation that a film set in a historical pe riod "perhaps inevitably ends up telling us more about the year of its production than the age it pur ports to be about" (p. 77), and goes on to illustrate his point with reference to the films under discussion. Anyone thinking that the attitudes revealed by Se rafy's analysis of these epics are now out-dated and, therefore, unimportant, should read the final two paragraphs of his contribution. In chapters six and seven the focus shifts from the showcase of Hollywood to the showcases of museums. Chapter six, an interesting contribution by Sally Mac Donald, presents encounters with Ancient Egypt from the viewpoint of the museum manager and curator, and considers results of research aimed at explor ing the nature and limits of the fascination with the subject that induces so many people to visit museum collections. These results, which run like a thread through the chapter, show, among other things, how influential the media (particularly the film industry) are in shaping public conceptions (or rather miscon ceptions). MacDonald strings ideas onto her thread like beads on a necklace. The chapter set this reviewer</page><page sequence="16">188 JARCE XLI (2004) thinking about many issues: constraints imposed by the scope of collections and by the buildings that house them; the nature of the controlling institutions; levels of funding; how objects might best be arranged and displayed; how gaps and weaknesses might be counterbalanced; the problem of labeling; how didac tic the approach should be; the use of replicas, re constructions, audio-visual material and multimedia presentations; the direction and thrust of marketing; the pull between curatorial and commercial concerns. The thought-provoking approach continues to the final sentence: "The challenge is to exploit the sub ject's popularity while questioning some of the as sumptions on which that popularity is based" (p. 99). Chapter seven, by Julian Walker contains both beads and spacers, but his thread is more difficult to unravel. "The procurement of ethnic objects?an act that may be likened to head-hunting?may be an act of ap propriation and dominance, although in a few cases it may be motivated by identification, confused iden tity, aesthetic appeal, or sympathy. In as much as dis playing mounted antlers or the stuffed head of a moose is a declaration of virility, dominance and the conquest of nature by the masculine power of the gun, the display of "antiques" from other countries or "ethnic" souvenirs ... is a declaration of social power and prowess" (p. 119). Gosh! In a paroxysm of guilt, this reviewer broke off reading the chapter in ques tion, embarked on a frenzied clear up of the house, stuffing all such objects at the back of the deepest, darkest cupboards, and then, remembering that some of them were the gifts of visiting Egyptians whose visits it was pleasant to recall, got them out again. If you can get past such rhetoric, then chapter eight, Fekri A. Hassan's contribution on presenting an im age of Egypt through the selling of souvenirs, has much to commend it. Tourists who intend to visit the country and have no knowledge of its customs would do well to reflect on what he has to say about bargain ing. As to his views and comments on the possibility of Egypt establishing a policy of cultural economic devel opment that made use of archaeological and cultural resources for alleviating poverty and for promoting a better understanding of Egyptian civilization, they are sensible and penetrating; let us also hope that they prove to be prophetic. Chapter nine by Fayza Haikal examines the regener ation of Egypt's past by its own people, and embraces Egyptologists, writers, librettists, satirists, architects, designers and commercial artists, sculptors, artists, and film-makers. In chapter ten, Okasha El Daly asks "What do Tourists Learn of Egypt?" One answer to this question is, a lot more if they travel with El Daly than with many other guides. Note the omission of the word "Ancient" from the title. El Daly has a good point to make and one that applies not only to Egypt. Many tourists revel in the splendors of the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the terracotta warriors, and return home not a whit wiser about China. Publishing is the topic examined by Andrew Wheat croft in chapter eleven. It is an interesting and wel come contribution to the book, for this is an aspect of Egyptology that most people outside the world of publishing probably rarely consider. Commercial ad vertising is the theme in chapter twelve by Bernadette Schnitzler, and in chapter thirteen Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince discuss "alternative Egypt/Egyptology." Many of the alternative theorists espouse ideas that are so plainly nonsensical that a description of the theorists as "pyramidiots" must be considered just. However, do not let this put you off reading chapter thirteen, for Picknett and Prince give a balanced, suc cinct and informative overview of the alternative schools of thought, and, with an emphasis on the un folding of events at Giza during the 1990s, discuss the most recent developments and the challenges they pose to Egyptological orthodoxy. As they so rightly observe, there are now certain issues under debate where Egyptologists can no longer simply ignore the claims of some of the alternative theorists. This being so, then the comments made above in connection with the phenomenon of "mummymania" (chapter two) are also pertinent here. The book ends with chapter fourteen by Tim Schadla-Hall and Genny Morris. They examine encounters with Ancient Egypt via the small screen and trace the development (actu ally, regression is a better word) of television images of the subject in the United Kingdom from the 1960s up to the present. Although what they have to say may appear self-evident, it is, nevertheless, worth stating, for it is all too easy never to give self-evident truths a second thought. It is to be hoped that some of those responsible for television programs will read this con tribution and profit from it. Traditional mainstream Egyptologists may feel dubious about picking up this wide-ranging volume, which is not highly academic, occasionally banal, sometimes amusing, at times provocative and often thought-provoking. Don't expect an epicurean ban quet. But, even if you are not prepared to consume Ancient Egypt with relish or, occasionally, with a pinch of salt, then at least give it a chance! Imhotep Today: Egyptianizing architecture (H. S. Smith) This volume, edited by Jean-Marcel Humbert and Clifford Price, treats of Egyptianizing architecture,</page><page sequence="17">BOOK REVIEWS 189 painting and decorative arts in the eighteenth to twen tieth centuries A.D.; it is the historical Imhotep, "archi tect" of the Step Pyramid, not the deified sage and patron of medicine who appears in the title. Though one might expect the authors to be historians of the architecture, art and culture of that era, they are in fact nearly all professional academics and museum cu rators with specialist interests in Egyptology or the ancient world, and by and large they treat the build ings described (few of them seemingly of high archi tectural merit, and many frankly ugly) with the same serious and exhaustive descriptive method with which they would treat genuine ancient monuments. The book is the longest and most lavishly illustrated in the whole series and the authors have evidently made great efforts to render their chapters as comprehen sive as possible; the reader is clearly being invited to regard it as a contribution, not to recent cultural his tory, but to Egyptology. The majority of the chapters are devoted to listing, describing and annotating historically the Egyptianiz ing buildings or displays in the following countries, regions or cities: St. Petersburg (Helen Whitehouse); London (nineteenth century displays, Alex Werner; entertainment and commerce in the twentieth cen tury, Chris Elliott, Katherine Griffis-Greenberg and Richard Lunn); U.S.A. (nineteenth century exhibitions, Marie-St?phanie Delamaire; architecture, Richard A. Fazzini and Mary E. McKercher); Victoria, Australia (Colin Hope); Paris (nineteenth century monuments, Cathie Bryan); Florence and its environs (garden or naments, Gloria Rosati); Brazil (Margaret Marchiori Bakos); and South Africa (Izak Cornelius). All of these chapters are competently and some entertainingly written; most give interesting historical summaries of the background to the taste for Ancient Egyptian motifs in the region concerned. A special concern of most authors is to discuss the motivations for the use of an Egyptianizing style and what it "symbolized" to its contemporary viewers; no doubt many of the sug gestions made are correct, but in summary it can only be said that, as in the case of most cultural phenom ena, causation was multiple, not single. There is gen erally no attempt to evaluate the artistic merit of the buildings or to argue that in the architecture of the past three centuries there has been a coherent "neo Egyptian" style comparable, say, with "neo-Gothic" or "neo-Classical"; as is apparent from the illustrations, these buildings usually employ a pastiche of Egyptian izing features to decorate structures rooted in other traditions. The introduction, "An Architecture between Dream and Meaning," by the editors discusses usefully vari ous "Manifestations of Egyptomania" class by class: pyramids and obelisks, tombs and funerary monu ments, applied decoration, entire structures, with sections on the development of "Egyptomania" in context and Egyptianizing symbolism. In their conclu sion they write: "It is extraordinary that Egyptomania has gripped so many cultures around the world, over such a long period of time. It is still not understood why Egypt, in particular, has attracted so much atten tion" (p. 20), but their own initial formulation: "These designs have contributed to the creation of an exotic cultural image, and they can convey a range of power ful connotations, open to numerous interpretations" (p. 1) seems as close to a general answer as is practica ble. The influence of China and Japan on western art and architecture has surely been as great. Jean-Marcel Humbert's chapter interestingly and succinctly discusses the uses of the pyramid in mod ern times, from the charming steep-sided examples (derived from the pyramid of Caius Cestius in Rome), which were employed as garden ornaments, revolu tionary monuments and mausolea in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the glass pyramid at the Louvre, which, its Sino-American architect Ieoh Ming Pei insists, has no Egyptian affiliations. Helen White house's excellent essay on Egyptian architecture in nineteenth century painting has the advantage that a considerable proportion of the works upon which she comments are by painters of true distinction (they number among them J.-L. G?r?me, P.-N. Gu?rin, E. Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, L. Alma-Tadema, and D. Roberts). She shows succinctly but deftly the vari ous ways in which Egyptian architecture could be used in narrative, landscape and "historical" painting, and how the artists' images of Egypt, though often striving for detailed accuracy, were generally formed more from acquaintance with the Description de T?gypte than from first-hand knowledge. The chapter on "Egypt in Masonic Iconography and Architecture" by John Hamill and Pierre Mollier will be valuable to most readers because it gives an excellent and clear outline of the origin, aims and history of Masonry in En gland and on the continent of Europe. This shows how the idea, now discounted, that Freemasonry had its origins in Ancient Egypt arose from references in the earliest Masonic documents to how Abraham and Euclid taught liberal arts and sciences to the Egyp tians, who then exported them. They note also the influence of the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt and of the activities of Giovanni and Sarah Belzoni in pro moting this idea, and describe a number of unusual and interesting Masonic buildings in Egyptian style. The final chapter by Beverley Butler discusses the philosophical, ideological, political and ethical issues that have surrounded (and sometimes bedeviled) the</page><page sequence="18">190 JARCE XLI (2004) contemporary revival of the ancient Mouseion and Library at Alexandria. Her purpose is a serious one, and through quotations from written sources and in terviews with Alexandrians she highlights the various shades of "cosmopolitanism," "revivalism," East-West confrontation, religious tolerance and intolerance, local and central government interests, academic "heritage" concerns, and financial realities that have underlain and influenced the forward-looking con cept of the revival and its execution. Her essay is thought-provoking, but unfortunately is phrased in an abstract terminology (a form of "UNESCO-Speak") that obscures meaning rather than revealing it. This book (like Consuming Ancient Egypt) deliber ately presents the study of Egyptianizing artifacts produced in the modern era as a legitimate study of the academic discipline of Egyptology rather than of modern historical and art historical studies, pre sumably in line with "recent advances in archaeologi cal and anthropological practice and interpretation" (Series Editor's Foreword); some (like this reviewer) may find this transfer bizarre, if not perverse. This series is excellently edited and produced (the present reviewers have noted only two textual errors of any moment). Each volume contains its own full bibliography and index, together with useful brief bi ographies of authors. The illustration is full and in general of good quality and four of the volumes bene fit from plates in color; the cover illustrations are both appropriate and attractive. The reviewers feel that Mysterious Lands, Ancient Egypt in Africa and Ancient Perspectives on Egypt would have benefited from more maps. There are many distinguished chapters, and while there are variations in quality these were proba bly inevitable in a series originating in a conference. As noted above, the reviewers think that certain chap ters in "Never Had the Like Occurred" and Ancient Per spectives on Egypt are rather marginally relevant to the main themes of these volumes, while other important and more pertinent evidence was not treated, and, arguably, there are omissions in other books. The volumes are, however, well cross-referenced, and the introductory chapters by the editors, mostly excellent, do much to help the reader appreciate the unifying purposes and themes of each study. A just criticism of the above review may be that it sometimes does little more than provide a synopsis of the books; this has been difficult to avoid, for the reviewers, not being conversant with all the topics presented, have found it difficult, and occasionally im possible, to make valid, constructive comments and criticisms. This in itself, however, should be viewed as a positive reflection on the series as a whole, which assembles a wide range of subject matter not treated together before. Although each volume, and indeed each contribution, may be read alone with profit, the full value of Encounters with Ancient Egypt can only be appreciated if the series is read in its entirety. The question whether the books justify the series editor's critical comments on the current state of Egyptological learning (quoted in the opening para graph of this review) will be answered differently by scholars according to their individual philosophies and disciplines. The thesis that the techniques used in field archaeology in Egypt need to be improved and that its focus should be changed to include more settlement work, especially in the Delta, is widely ac knowledged and is in course of being put into effect (though the practical and administrative difficulties are often severe). That Egyptology is "insular" in cer tain respects and that its practitioners should collabo rate more consciously and effectively with scholars in other disciplines should also be acknowledged, though perusal of the first four volumes treated here tends to confirm these reviewers' conviction that the exceptional and unbalanced bias of Egyptology's source material towards funerary archaeology and texts (due mainly to accidents of survival) is a major reason for the subject's apparent isolation. The more critical and problem-oriented approach to problems advocated in these books will surely be beneficial, though the reviewers think that some authors in them underestimate the major changes that have taken place in Egyptological analysis over the past quarter of a century. Certainly, the resolution of some of the more vital problems discussed (e.g., the identity of the "Sea Peoples," Egypt's relations with Levantine states and its disputed cultural influence on "Inner Africa") is dependent upon practical and analytical archaeo logical work outside Egypt's borders, and cannot be resolved by Egyptologists alone. These volumes undoubtedly do a further service in calling attention to the "colonialist" and "racist" as sumptions underlying some interpretations of An cient Egyptian source material in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries A.D., and the need for more critical attitudes to the subject's own historiography. It seems doubtful, however, whether the constantly recurring emphasis on these themes in impugning earlier Egyptological work will be found acceptable among continental European scholars, or whether it will appear to them to be a bias due to specifically An glophone intellectual fashions and guilt-complexes. All learned writing reflects the ideas and mores of its time; the present is no different, and (as pointed out</page><page sequence="19">BOOK REVIEWS 191 above) this series may itself be seen in future to reflect the prejudices of its age. Finally, the question whether the subject matter of the last four books reviewed should really be the province of Egyptology or of vari ous modern historical and art historical disciplines is largely subjective, and individual readers will doubt less select what is and is not of interest to them. Cer tainly, the consideration of reactions to Ancient Egypt in medieval, renaissance and modern times makes the scholar more conscious of the intellectual traditions that underlie his work and, for the modern general reader, brings this ancient civilization within the focus and preoccupations of his own time and tradition. Against this, viewing Ancient Egypt through later ideas that have no relation to the realities of its own culture, society and beliefs may well cloud the true in terpretation (already difficult enough) of the original sources of our knowledge of them. However individual readers may react to particular volumes or studies, what is not in doubt is that the series editor's claim that the study of Ancient Egypt will be significantly advanced and deepened by this series is a true one; all eight volumes should be on the shelves of every university and learned library.
