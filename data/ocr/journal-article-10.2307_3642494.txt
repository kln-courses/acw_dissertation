<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY CULTURES OF THE SOUTH ANATOLIAN PLATEAU, II THE LATE CHALCOLITHIC AND EARLY BRONZE AGES IN THE KONYA PLAIN By JAMES MELLAART III. THE LATE CHALCOLITHIC OF THE KONYA PLAIN The end of the Qatal Haiyk West culture is shrouded in mystery. Both gatal and Kara Huiytik South were apparently deserted and never reoccupied and it is only at Can Hasan Hiyiik east of Karaman that later deposits have been recognised overlying remains of the early Chalcolithic culture. Elsewhere the evidence lies buried in the cores of the numerous city mounds of the Early Bronze Age period. Late Chalcolithic remains are fairly common in the Konya Plain, but they were in nearly every case found on sites where no earlier or later remains were encountered. This might suggest a shift in the settlement pattern of the plain after the end of the Early Chalcolithic period (see map, Fig. I). MONOCHROME WARE (class a) (Figs. 2, 3) The clay is buff or reddish, with black cores, and full of grits and straws. Firing is often poor except in small vessels and the craftsmanship is often mediocre. The pottery bears a thin burnished slip, usually of red colour, but often brown, buff, or occasionally blackish brown. Decoration is rare and the incised piece (Fig. 2 : i) has no white-filling material. Plastic knobs and ridges appear (Figs. 2 : 3 ; 3 : i, 4, 13). Most characteristic are the bold handles, sometimes more like lugs (Fig. 2 : 4, 6). These are the first examples of handles on the pottery in the Konya Plain. At Mersin very similar handles are first introduced with the intrusive Mersin XVI culture, with which the pottery in question has numerous parallels. The shape of these handles varies considerably: some are great loops on jars (not illustrated), others almost circular in profile. Still others have strap- like sections with marked edges (Fig. 3 : 9; cf. Mersin). At the western end of the area, at Kanal Huiyuk near Seydigehir and at Kagakll 2 near the south-western end of Lake Beygehir, these handles become elongated into ungainly tubular lugs. These handles are found on bowls and jars/jugs. By far the most characteristic shape yet recognised in the monochrome ware is a biconical hole-mouth jar or deep bowl with two handles (Fig. 2 : 1-6, 9-14). Bowls with handles are less common (Fig. 2 : 7, 8), but those with flaring sides are frequent (Fig. 3 1: 4-19). These sometimes have small lugs (ibid., 14, 15). Bowls with carination and flaring rim (ibid., 20) are infrequent. Two forms of necked jars have been recognised ; those with strongly carinated profiles (Fig. 3 : 1-3, 9-1 ) and those with rounded profiles and a small everted rim (Fig. 3 : 3, 5-7) painted in red on buff. Basket-handled jars still occur (Fig. 3 : 12). Among other shapes, not closely datable, we may mention the first appearance of scored ware (Fig. 3 : 8) ; lids (Fig. 3 : 21, 22), knobbed handles (Fig. 3 : 23) and baking platters (Fig. 3 24-5). All of these might belong to the end of the Late Chalcolithic period. The monochrome wares have some parallels at Mersin; both hole-mouth shapes and jars with handles are evidently related to, though not identical with, those illustrated in Prehistoric Mersin, Figs. 92 : 9, I ; 94 : 6, 8 ; 102 : i8 (bowls) and Fig. 94 : I, 9, I1-13 (jars). For a bowl with flaring sides see ibid., Fig. 94 : 10o. 1 Prehistoric Mersin, Figs. 9 1-4. 2 This pottery is too coarse to merit illustration.</page><page sequence="2">.,,.. ,.. ., KONYA PLAIN SURVEY. , . ..

Nevertheless, this pottery is found throughout the whole Konya Plain, but it is notably rare in its eastern half and absent in the Beygehir-Seydigehir region. The fabric of this pottery is buff or grey with small grits and straw, well made, often thin and adequately fired. Black cores are common and technically it does not differ from the following E.B.I burnished wares. On the other hand, it is superior to the monochrome ware of class a. This pottery is normally slipped and burnished. The colours range from red and buff through several red-and-blackish browns to black. Many of the smaller bowls have black interiors and rims, whereas the exterior is red, buff or brown. The white paint is invariably matt and often thick. It was applied after burnishing, but before firing. The white paint is often faded and has sometimes worn off. Besides miniature jars (Fig. 4: I, 2), body-sherds of jugs or jars (ibid., 23, 26, 30) and a lid (ibid., 33), all the vessels decorated with white paint are bowls. Among those, bowls with simple hemispherical profiles predominate. Some are small and fine (Fig. 4: 6-8), others large with profiles of varying thickness (Fig. 4: 9-20). Another bowl shape has flaring sides, a small flat base and one or more horizontally perforated lugs, set below a double projection on the rim (Fig. 4 : 21, 22 (monochrome), 24). A third shape has a slightly everted rim and a faint carination (Fig. 4: 25, 29). This shape also occurs in plain monochrome ware (ibid., 27, 28). Finally there is one dark burnished biconical bowl (ibid., 32). Two other monochrome bowl shapes are shown (Fig. 4 : 5, 31). The decoration is applied to those parts of the various vessels as can be seen. On jars it is therefore only found on the outside, and only the top of a lid is decorated. On the carinated bowls only the part above the carination is ornamented, and on the shallow flaring bowls only the interior. On hemispherical bowls, on the other hand, decoration of both interior and exterior is often found. The repertoire of patterns is far from rich, but perhaps richer than is normally found in this specific technique. By far the most common single motif is the group of parallel chevrons, which here-as in the Early Chalcolithic wares (and Mersin XII 4)--often interlace (Fig. 4: 20, 25, 29). Another motif particular to the area is the combination of chevrons with vertical, and less commonly, horizontal (Fig. 4 : 9) lines (ibid., I2, 7, 33). On the shallow flaring bowls, these vertical lines divide the bowl radially (ibid., 21, 24). When seen from above these bowls resemble fluted metal vessels, which they may conceivably imitate. Unfortunately only small fragments of decorated jugs or jars were found, for it would appear that here the Late Chalcolithic potters found scope for more ambitious patterns (Fig. 4: 23, 26). The nearest parallels for the Late Chalcolithic white-painted pottery of the Konya Plain occur on five sites between Aygeplnar and Menengi in the Samanti Valley, south of Fraktin.5 With their black interiors, painted with thin white patterns, and red or brown exteriors, they may be compared to our thin bowls. Some of the Samanti Valley specimens have small strap handles, but the material from the Konya Plain is not rich enough to rule out their existence. At the E.B.A. 3 See AS. IV, I954, pp. 194-8, Figs. 163-181. * Prehistoric Mersin, Fig. i 18. 5 T.

Ozgtiu suggests that they belong to the end of the Early Bronze Age, linking them with the late white-painted bowls from Karaoglan. However that may be, the writer would prefer to link them with the Late Chalcolithic pieces here described. Another site with white-painted pottery, roughly datable to this period, is Yazir near Sivrihisar, but of the pottery only some has been published.6 Mersin XII also is characterised by the sudden appearance of black burnished wares, ornamented in this fashion. The culture is generally considered to be intrusive and in the Cilician Plain confined to Mersin. White-painted pottery does, however, occur in the Calycadnus valley, at Maltepe and Silifke 7 and as this is the way by which plateau influences repeatedly reached Mersin, the writer would suggest that this intrusive culture at Mersin (like its predecessor, Mersin XVI) followed this route from the Konya Plain. None of the Mersin XII shapes is identical with the ones illustrated here and pedestals and tab-handles, which form a prominent feature, have not yet been found on the southern plateau. Nevertheless, flaring bowls and bowls with simple profiles are not unknown in the ceramic record of the Konya Plain (Fig. 3 : 14-19) and it may well be that when levels of the Late Chalcolithic period are reached in excavations, earlier than the top levels the ploughing or erosion of which has yielded our specimens, closer correspondences will be found. Technically both wares may be considered identical. Finally attention should be drawn to a few pieces of another painted ware of this period, which though rare, has left some traces. A number of sherds, both from the Qumra region and the plain of Karaman, show matt red (and in one case matt red and black) paint on a white slip (Figs. 3 : 5-6, and 4 : 3, 4). The material here described was found during field surveys, but recently Mr. David French, excavating at Can Hasan, has found Late Chalcolithic material stratified-although in pits-above Middle Chalcolithic painted wares and it is hoped that in future seasons buildings of this period may be located. The desertion of most of the Late Chalcolithic village mounds located in the Konya Plain by our survey is still puzzling. At Sarlak the new Early Bronze Age mound stands on the other side of the stream, but in most cases there are no Early Bronze Age mounds in the immediate vicinity of the Late Chalcolithic ones. Only excavations can establish whether the change of settlement was accompanied by other important changes at the transition from the Late Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age. A fair amount of continuity is suggested by the only evidence which is as yet plentiful for this period : pottery. 6 V. Tiirk Tarih Kongresi (Ankara, I960), Pls. XLVI-L. 7 AS. IV, I954, Fig. 164.

THE EARLY BRONZE AGE IN THE KONYA PLAIN (Fig. 5) Few areas of Turkey have yielded more impressive evidence for the wealth and importance of a single culture province in the first two phases of the Early Bronze Age than the Konya Plain. Nowhere else on the Anatolian Plateau does one find such a concentration of mounds of this period; nowhere else such a number of large city-size mounds. Over an area of about 200 miles, from Beygehir to Ni de, we find evidence of a more or less uniform pottery, and beyond in the passes of the Cilician Taurus-the Cilician Gates and the Calycadnus valley, we find the same. In the plain of Cilicia, the earliest Bronze Age remains, stratified above a totally different Late Chalcolithic, are intrusive, but the new wares are exactly those which dominate the ceramic industries of the Konya Plain. Whatever local Cilician or Syrian component existed in the E.B.I and 2 cultures of Tarsus- the type site for the Cilician plain-they were overshadowed by the plateau wares, thus showing, conclusively in our opinion, that the people who introduced the Early Bronze Age into Cilicia had their origin in the Konya Plain. Westward into the mountains, Konya Plain influences dominate the E.B.I period and it is not till E.B.2 that South-western influences become established in the region of Beygehir. Northward, Konya Plain pottery is found at Tutup, the mound which dominates the pass across the Boz Dag leading into the plain from the semi-desert area south of the Great Salt Lake. Along the northern edge of the plain, below the frowning barren hills of the Boz Dag, a series of great city mounds mark an important trade route to the east-leading from Konya (and Beygehir beyond) straight to the Cilician Gates and the great silver mines of Bolkar and Bereketli Maden. The sites in the ova of Karapinar show pottery of Konya Plain type and sherds of such wares were found imported at the Central Anatolian sites of Qokyatan and Oresun, north and north-east of Aksaray. The ceramic boundary between Konya Plain and Central Anatolia lies at the ridge north of Bor and south of Nigde. The lofty bulk of Karadag and the strange and eerie desert region of Karapinar with the fresh and saltwater lakes of Eregli divide the Konya Plain into three great FIG. 3. x. Can Hasan.

Most of the great city sites lie in the first two regions, but the third was important, not for its agriculture, but for its strategic position-it commands the Cilician Gates and the route to the north-and for the silver mines in the mountains above. The Karaman area commanded the main route to the south ; the Calycadnus valley and the Qumra ovasi, well watered by the Qarsamba gay, held the roads to the west, and the entire hill country of Seydigehir and Beygehir formed part of the province. Not less than a hundred sites can be assigned to the E.B.I-2 period in the Konya Plain, not including those that may lie buried below the great Middle Bronze Age, Iron Age and Classical mounds. Of these the majority are villages, of smaller or larger extent, but many can only be cities, each with their citadel raised above the rest of the site. Among these Kerhane, Samih, Seydihan, Biiyiik Aglama, Emirler, Eminler stand out, but none reach the dimensions of Kana9 Hiiyiik, north of Karaman, which has a diameter of nearly a mile. Early Bronze Age sites in the Konya Plain have not yet been the subject of archaeological investigation, but a deep sounding in the Middle Bronze Age mound of Kara Hiiyiik near Konya, which is being excavated by Professor Sedat Alp, has revealed a deep deposit of E.B.A. remains. Although the more spectacular finds belong to the Middle Bronze Age, the sequence of Early Bronze Age levels will prove to be of the utmost importance for the prehistory of the Konya Plain. Late E.B.A. (or E.B.3) pottery shows painted patterns in red on a buff or pink ground, parallel to but different from the Cappadocian ware of Central Anatolia. Earlier levels have produced " metallic ware ", dark burnished wares, etc., of a type that will be described here from the numerous mounds found in our survey. FIG. 4. I. Sarlak North.

Nowhere on the Anatolian plateau is there such compelling evidence for wholesale destruction at the end of the E.B.2 period-about 2300 B.C. in rough terms-as in this plain. As far as we can see not a single major site escaped destruction by conflagration (marked in list with asterisk) and the numerous deserted villages tell the same tale. To this very day, the burnt mounds of the Konya Plain are a witness in their truly uncanny desolation to a savage destruction that took place here long before the days when man recorded historical events in Anatolia. From that day no living soul seems to have settled on these mounds but for the reed shelters of a lone shepherd accompanied by his dog, impervious to the ghosts and spirits that haunt these sites according to the present villagers. For this reason the pottery illustrated here belongs to the E.B.I and 2 periods. Only seven E.B.3 sites are known to me : Kara Htiyuik-Konya, Sizma, Seydihan, Ortakaraviran and Zencirli, Haunsaray and perhaps Kara H.-Akviran. It is unlikely that these are the sum total of E.B.3 mounds in the plain, but as at Kara Hiiyiik we may expect E.B.3 remains below the Middle Bronze Age sites of which there are about thirty-five known. EARLY BRONZE AGE I-2 POTTERY Without a stratified pottery sequence it is impossible to distinguish between E.B. i and E.B.2 pottery, but such a distinction is nevertheless highly desirable as these two periods span a minimum of seven centuries and perhaps as much as a whole millennium. E.B.2 comes to an end with the " Luvian " invasion c. 2300 B.c. There is only one way of applying some criterion of dating to this mass of pottery and that is a comparison with that of Tarsus, which is well stratified. This procedure is probably justified for the E.B.I period, for it seems now more than likely that the E.B.A. culture of Cilicia was derived from that of the Konya Plain. However, for the following period we cannot be so sure, for both regions are likely to have developed their own shapes, forms of decoration and other peculiarities, some of which, like the wheelmade wares in Cilicia at least, are certainly of Syrian inspiration. Five main classes of Early Bronze Age I-2 pottery can be distinguished in the Konya Plain, each with their own shapes, although there is some overlapping. A. Burnished wares. B. " Metallic " ware, frequently painted. C. Red-painted ware. D. Scored ware. E. Plain coarse ware. All this pottery is hand-made and with the exception of the " Metallic ware " has a straw temper, which is often abundant and visible on the surface, e.g. in the Red-painted ware, which is rather coarse and in the Scored and coarse wares. The burnished wares are the finest class of pottery and the red variety is frequently slipped. Technically class A is the continuation of the Late Chalcolithic burnished wares. Classes D and E also continue from that period and class C may be a development of the rare painted ware of the Late Chalcolithic. The real innovation is the " Metallic " ware, which is grit tempered and overfired. It is a stone ware with the clay fused in the firing and the paint is often vitrified. It is hard and</page><page sequence="13">EARLY CULTURES OF THE SOUTH ANATOLIAN PLATEAU 211 clinky and extremely easy to recognise in its characteristic form, but less obviously so in its " red gritty " and its apricot variants. The potters of this period in the Konya Plain made little use of decoration. The white-painted designs of the Late Chalcolithic burnished ware have virtually disappeared and white-filled incision, more common in Cilicia, is rare. The patterns painted in red on the chaff-faced class C are few and simple ; bands, stripes and rows of dots and a few stars and swastikas exhaust the repertoire. Most of these same motifs are found in the painted metallic ware (class B) with the addition of " trees ", wriggly lines and fields of dots. Decoration on scored ware (class D) is confined to red stripes. Grooves and fluting are only found on the contact zone with the south-western province where such forms of decoration are common. Metallic ware often has incised marks on the top part of the handle, but its decorative value is nil and they might be potters' marks. There is a little impressed ware, mainly on lids. DISTRIBUTION (Figs. 6, 7) The distribution of these five classes of pottery in the Konya Plain varies, and though it must be remembered that all the evidence is derived from surface finds only, the area of the greatest frequency of a certain ware is likely to point to its probable area of origin. The red, grey and black burnished wares of class A evidently have their centre of distribution in the ovas of Qumra and Karaman, but they spread up to Beygehir and Seydi?ehir and down the Calycadnus valley. In the eastern third of the plain between Erehli and Bor they are definitely less common and a coarser brown burnished ware seems to take its place. The incised types are so far confined to the central area. The " metallic" ware of class B shows a different distribution. It is most common in the plain of Karaman, then all round the Karadag and in the plain between Eregli and Bor. It is also common in the Calycadnus valley and its red gritty variant appears at Kana? (Karaman) and round Ulukigla. It is much less frequent in the Qumra-Konya area and rare in the hill country or on the garsamba river valley between Beygehir and Seydigehir (Fig. 6). The production- centre of this pottery lies obviously in the centre and east of the plain, whereas that of the burnished wares was in the centre and west. The red-painted ware (class C) and the scored ware (class D) are confined to the centre and west, and have not yet been found outside the plain or in its eastern third. The plain coarse wares (class E) occur throughout the plain and its extensions, including the typical baking platters and horseshoe hearths. DESCRIPTION OF THE POTTERY OF E.B.I1-2 A. Burnished Wares This class can be divided into red and black burnished wares, each with numerous variations in colour: plum red with orange buff, light brown or mottled and black with grey, dark brown and mottled specimens. Clays are buff and mixed with white grits and fine chopped straw. Slips are common and the ware is hard-fired, but grey cores predominate. The slip is very often crackled and the vessels are well burnished in the smaller shapes, but frequently rather dull in the larger ones. Long exposure to the air and salt of the plain may have affected the surface and reduced its original lustre.</page><page sequence="14">(rl q . ... . .. .. ,, . . , ": g~32 go~ ...'

Two-colour effects on a class of thin bowls, probably of E.B. i date, are frequent, with red exteriors and black interiors as in the Late Chalcolithic (see Fig. 4 : 8, 21). Shapes.-Very common is a class of thin bowls with curving profiles, red or black or in any variant of these two groups or with two-colour effect. Sometimes these have a small lug below the rim and small omphalos bases are common (Fig. 8 : I-3, 5-20). At Tarsus their floruit falls within the E.B. period (Tarsus, II, Fig. 345, top left) and in the Konya Plain also the small forms and especially '--N. Sad .....~ -.-;  +.: . .

Distribution of scored ware, incised burnished ware, etc., in the Konya Plain (for numbers see list on p. 209). those with two colours seem early rather than late, but the red ones probably run on into E.B.2. No less common are straight-sided bowls and cups with flat bases and some- times provided with a single lug or handle (Fig. 8 : 4, 21-31). Some are red, but most are black or grey. The shape is evidently derived from the flaring bowls of the Late Chalcolithic (Fig. 3 : 14-19, 22, and 4: 21, 22, 24) and some still have vestigial rim lugs. At Tarsus, this shape is characteristic of E.B.I (Tarsus, II, Fig. 344, bottom right, and 345, bottom left), in both black and red ware, and frequently incised. The Tarsus profiles are often nearer to the Late Chalcolithic ones of Mersin XII (Prehistoric Mersin, Fig. I I8 : 3, 10, I3, 14). Black burnished incised and white filled cups and bowls of this shape in the Konya Plain (Fig. Io : I-6) show closer resemblances to those of early E.B.2 at Tarsus (Tarsus, II, Figs. 257-8, 351) than to those of E.B.I (ibid., 240, two top rows). In the Konya Plain this shape evidently spans E.B.I and at least a part of E.B.2.</page><page sequence="16">214 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Straight-sided bowls on disc bases in plum red burnished ware (Fig. I2 :1-3) are less common and are identical to those of E.B.I Tarsus (Tarsus, II, Figs. 241 and 345, no. Io9). Red and buff burnished cups with a loop handle rising above the rim, a common E.B.2 type in Central and S.W. Anatolia, also occur in the Konya Plain (Fig. I2: 4-8), but unless the handle is preserved they are indistinguishable from small bowls and they may be more common than the few examples found suggest. An E.B.2 date is suggested, but the shape may have started in E.B.I (cf. Tarsus, II, Fig. 346, 138 E.B.i). The cup or bowl with drooping handle, characteristic for Tarsus E.B.2 (op. cit., Fig. 349 : nos. 352, 354, 31 o), so far unknown in the Konya Plain, may be a southern version. Larger bowls, usually in red slipped ware, and provided with lugs (Fig. 8: 23; Fig. 9: 8, 9), ledge handles (Fig. 9 : 3, 4, 7), vertical (Fig. 9: 6) or horizontal tubular lugs (Fig. 9 : 5 and Io) or a horizontally placed handle (Fig. 9 : i ) are not uncommon. Frequently they are remarkably shallow (Fig. 9: 1-3). The tubular lugs probably point to south-western influence whereas the horizontal handle is far more common in E.B.2 Cilicia (Tarsus, II, Fig. 347: 297, 298). Most of these bowls probably belong to the E.B.2 period. In the valley of the 9argamba gay between Beygehir and Seydigehir plum red burnished bowls with thickened or inverted rims are typical, a form that is rare in the plain (Fig. 9 : 12, from Sarlak in the plain; 13-21, from gargamba valley). At first sight these inverted rim bowls look like a parallel to Kumtepe Ib-Troy I developments. Alternately one might point out south-western influence in this region in E.B.2, which is well attested in surface finds. However, such bowls are not a feature of the nearest south-western cultures and the fact that we find very similar types in E.B.2 Tarsus (op. cit., Fig. 347 : AA-AI) rather suggests a local development. The bowl (Fig. 9 : 22), not as rare as the single illustration suggests, has some more remote parallels in Tarsus E.B.2, where everted rims (ibid., Fig. 3: 347, two top rows) are more pronounced than in the Konya Plain.

Some of these (Fig. 9: 23, 25-27) are made in fine red burnished or mottled ware and others not here illustrated from Kutiiik Aglama are in burnished grey ware. Fig. 9 24 is in coarse ware, but there is a whole series in a fairly coarse brown burnished ware from sites in the Eregli-Bor plain (Fig. 9 : 28-33, 35) where they are very characteristic. They either have knobs or great loop handles, like the more common coarse red burnished basins (Fig. 9 : 37-38) or they have broad horned handles (Fig. 9 : 35)- In coarse buff ware, such hole- mouth shapes with horned handles (Fig. 9 : 34, 36, 40, 41) occur throughout the Konya Plain from Yanagelmez south of Konya and Tutup, north of the Bozdag to Beytepe near Ulukigla. Horned handles are frequently a feature of the Late Chalcolithic, but unless our dating is wrong, they may well have survived in the coarse ware of the Konya Plain. In the case of the hole-mouth shape the reader will have noticed that we have digressed well beyond the limit of the burnished ware class; in fact this shape occurs in every gradation from fine burnished to coarse ware. Now this will happen again when we look at another particular shape, the face-urn as Schliemann called it at Troy. Necked jars, perhaps provided with lids, are a feature of this culture province. On the neck a human face is modelled with protuberant eyes, a nose and usually eyebrows (Fig. Io : 15-24). They probably date from E.B.2, but one cannot be too certain, as we have no parallels from Tarsus. Many of these jars were made in red and brown burnished ware, others are plain red or brown, others are painted and still others are coarse. As only rim fragments survive, it is impossible to say whether the bodies of the jars were furnished with more anthropomorphic details, but a wrist and hand from one of these (Fig. o : 25) suggests that occasionally the potters produced such.

There is, however, an example of a face from Kumtepe Ic, as early as early Troy I. The Konya Plain examples are probably contemporary with Troy II, the E.B.2 period, and the excavation of Kara Huytik-Konya has shown that such faces were still made in the Middle Bronze Age, though in a somewhat different form. Jars and Jugs (Fig. I I).-Fragments of jars and jugs are exceedingly common in the Konya Plain, but it is often extremely difficult to decide whether we are dealing with straight-mouthed jars or oblique-rimmed jugs. It would appear that the one often faded into the other, and the only criterion is the rising spout. When not enough of the rim is preserved, no choice can be made. In West Anatolian cultures this difficulty hardly arises as beak-spouts have a tendency to be high and pronounced, but in the Konya Plain they are frequently low and wide (with an oval orifice). Most of the jars and jugs are made in red burnished ware, but there is evidence for black ones, some of which had incised decoration (Fig. Io :10 7, 8). A fine specimen from Sizma (Fig. Io : I3), red slipped and burnished and probably belonging to E.B.2, was evidently not the only one in existence. Fragments of incised red ware (Fig. Io : Io, I I) may belong to similar vessels or to incised jars (like Fig. io : 14). A number of types of jars varying from small to medium-sized vessels are illustrated in Fig. i : 1-8, 12. Many of these may have had handles. Nos. 4, 6, 7 had tubular spouts, which are very common in the plain and such juglets may have been used as feeding bottles. Other wider jars are shown in Fig. I I : 5 and 12, the latter provided with a handle which is very characteristic of the Konya Plain and which ends in a wide half disc set below the curving part of the handle (Fig. 12 : 39, 42, 43). Many of these come from large vessels, jars or jugs, and they have no parallels outside the Konya Plain. Other handles of large red jugs or jars have ridges or a knob near the top (Fig. 12 : 44, 45) ; whereas others still have a handle with knobs on either end (Fig. I2 : 38). With only part of the rim preserved it is impossible to tell whether Fig. 12 : 40-45 were parts of jugs or jars, and the same difficulty arises in the case of the sherds shown in Fig. i I : 17-22.

The handles have a tendency to be set flush with the rim or rising just above it. In the larger beak-spouted jugs the lower end of the " peg " handle is thrust through a hole in the body (Fig. ii : 13-15, 28-29). Oblique spouts vary considerably in height and width: in the juglets they are hardly perceptible (Fig. 11 : 9-1I, 13) and in the larger vessels there are other low spouts (Fig. I I : 14, 15, 26). By far the most characteristic red burnished beak-spout is the one illustrated in Fig. II : 16, 23, 25, 27-29, which is well represented throughout the western and central part of the plain, though absent in the east. Knobs and rivets frequently occur below and on either side of the spout. There is a distinct bulge where neck meets body and a marked angle where spout meets neck. Another version without oblique spout produces a flask (Fig. I I : 24) of which there are other examples from Sizma. With the exception of the feeding bottle, which in a different version occurs at Tarsus (Tarsus, II, Fig. 246 : 229), parallelism with Cilicia is not close and it would appear that Cilician beak-spouts were based on metallic ware types. Nor do these Konya Plain jugs show any analogy to those of Western or Central Anatolia and they appear to be a local variant on a common theme, at home in the Konya Plain, but nowhere else. Nearly all the jugs and jars in Fig. i i should probably be assigned to the E.B.2 period, but we do not know when these types started or how they developed. The jug with cut-away spout which appears first in E.B.3 is evidently of West Anatolian origin and not represented among the earlier material, neither here nor in Cilicia. C. Painted Ware Although fairly common in the west and central parts of the plain, red or brown-painted ware appears to have a strictly limited number of shapes. This pottery is on the whole badly made of a clay full of chaff, which is often visible on the surface. Grey cores are legion and the surface is generally yellowish-grey or FIG. I I. I. Kerhane.

The surface was merely smoothed, rarely polished and the mat paint, sloppily applied, varied from a fine red to brown or almost black. A cream slip is rare. Patterns are restricted to bands on bowls of large size (Fig. I2 : 24-34), either flaring or hemispherical, or to lids (Fig. 12: 18-23), to the rims of coarsely-shaped jars (Fig. I2 : 36) or to pointed handles of jars (Fig. 12 : 35-37). The necks of jars are painted red with a horizontal row of dots below (Fig. Io : 15 ; Fig. 12 : 14-15 [jars or jugs ?]) and stripes are found on handles (Fig. 12 : I6, I7). Swags frequently occur below the handle (Fig. 12 : I4, I5), cf. the black incised fragment (Fig. Io : 8) ; on the body we find wavy lines (Fig. 12 : I o) or centrifugal patterns around a knob or rivet (Fig. I2 : 9, 13, and possibly 15). A single painted beak-spout fragment (Fig. 12 : 12) shows a pattern like that of the black incised cups (Fig. Io : i-6) with hatched triangles and dots between parallel lines. Bands and rows of dots, spiral whorls, swags and wavy lines are all features common on the painted metallic ware and these similarities in painting are further proof of the contemporaneity of these two wares. In many respects this decadent painted ware is a western form of the painted metallic ware which has a more eastern distribution. The copying of patterns from the black incised ware-again western-would tend to confirm this. Most unusual is the use of black and white paint on a red burnished ground seen in the sherd Fig. 12 : I . The only other case of the use of white paint on red burnished ware is the sherd with the hand in relief (Fig. Io : 24). The date of this painted pottery is probably E.B.2 and its shapes conform to those of the burnished wares of class A. FIGo. 12. I. Sarlak. Dull red wash, polished. 2. Kerhane.

Scored Ware On account of its decoration, which was probably produced with a brush when the clay was still wet, we have classified a form of coarse ware under the heading " scored ware ". In fact, but for its decoration, its shapes are on the whole the same as those of the red slipped larger vessels or the coarse ware, and only the finer table wares are not treated in this way. All the scored ware shapes are jars of some kind or other or large bowls and basins, i.e. vessels for storage (Fig. 13 : 1-18). The ware is buff or red with heavy grit and straw temper, grey cores pre- dominate and the firing is hard. A lot of the pottery has a buff surface like the coarse ware, but much is red. Frequently this pottery is slipped red after scoring or even decorated with painted stripes (Fig. 13 : 6, 15) and the rim and interior is sometimes roughly burnished. Jars (Fig. 13 : 1-3, 5-7, 9-I1), with pithoi (Fig. I3: 16) and large bowls or basins (Fig. 13 : 4, 8, 12-15, 17), are the most common shapes. Pithos bases bear mat impressions and many bowl rims are so straight as to suggest that they formed part of rectangular vessels. Others may be parts of lids. The jars have simple strap handles and often knobs and others have coarse stumpy ledge handles. Scored patterns are also found on fragments of hearths or fenders (Fig. 13 : I8), which are usually made in coarse ware (Fig. 13 : 19) and often provided with impressed designs showing a human face. There are no examples of a conscious attempt to produce patterns in scored ware. Scored ware also occurs in Cilicia (Tarsus, II, Fig. 243 : 125, 137, E.B.i, and Fig. 252 : 244, 245a and b, E.B.2) ; at Troy from Id onwards (Troy, I, pp. 39, 45) as well as along the Aegean seaboard in the plain of Edremit, at Hitiyicek near Larisa, near Kugadasi, on Samos in Heraion III, etc. Patterns consciously impressed with a grooved tool occur on a number of FIG. 13.

Again there are parallels at Tarsus (op. cit., Fig. 253 254, 247) in the E.B.2 period. E. Coarse Ware Coarse ware is ubiquitous on nearly every site in the Konya Plain province. It is technically the same as the scored ware minus the decoration, and red, brown or buff in colour, smoothed or wiped, and not burnished. Large shapes for storage prevail : pithoi, with broad rims (Fig. Io : 16, 19, 20, 24), basins (Fig. 9 : 37-39), cooking pots (Fig. 9 24), hole-mouth jars (Fig. 9 : 34-36, 40, 41).

Baking platters, known in the Konya Plain since the Late Chalcolithic (Fig. 3: 21-22), also occur at Tarsus (op. cit., Fig. 346 : H, I, L, P (E.B.I), and Fig. 252 : 305 (E.B.2). No attempt will here be made to date the coarse ware of the Konya Plain, for, like the scored ware, it has its beginnings in the Late Chalcolithic period and continued to be made throughout the Early Bronze Age I and 2 periods.

Metallic Ware (Figs. 14-17) No single class of pottery in Southern Anatolia can claim such an individual and unique appearance, in texture, shapes and decoration, as the metallic ware of the Konya Plain. Throughout its use it preserved these qualities and there is no evidence that it ever borrowed a single shape from the other classes of pottery which were in use at the same time. This strange ware which upon its first discovery in 1951 was named " metallic ware " because of its sharp profiles, its bevelled edges, its omphalos bases and other presumably metallic features, is on the whole extremely easy to recognise, for it does not resemble any other form of pottery in Anatolia. Its distribution is shown in Fig. 6, and includes Cilicia. It was also found during the excavations at Mersin (Prehistoric Mersin, Fig. 122), but unfortunately nothing like it was recognised among the stratified deposits of the site. At Tarsus, much of this pottery was found stratified in E.B.I and 2 levels, but its few variants are split up into several classes (red gritty, apricot and miniature lug ware) and though described in full and illustrated in numerous photographs (Tarsus, II, Figs. 237 : 53-56; 239 : 62-68 ; 247 : 253 : 250-252 ; 254 : 235-238) there are no profile drawings, no reconstructions, and this class of pottery is very inadequately treated. Finally, during the Cilician survey in 1951, much of this pottery was assigned to " local base-ring ware " (AS. IV, 134-5). Metallic ware, both early and late, has a pale red or buff body clay with white limestone grits and no straw, which distinguishes it immediately from all the other E.B.A. wares. Grey cores are uncommon, for this pottery is very well fired and frequently overfired so that the clay fused into a stone ware. As a result of this high firing the clay was pitted over the limestone particles (hence the term " red gritty ware ") and very often the surface has fired to a purple colour and the paint is vitrified and glossy. Whereas the coarser examples are pink, light red or buff (especially in E.B. I), the finer have a leathery buff, brown or apricot colour which is well polished. The interior often shows signs of wiping, similar to, but much finer than in the scored ware. Walls of vessels are often remarkably thin. Mottling is common. Metallic ware in the Konya Plain is very often painted, in the later versions invariably so. Early red gritty specimens show hatching, stripes or wavy lines in a matt white, red or orange paint, sometimes both ; later examples have bands of brown to purplish or red paint along the rim of bowls, jars and jugs, on the base of the neck, round lugs and knobs and on handles, which like spouts are often coated completely. The paint is often thin and washy, and was applied with a brush, sometimes as carelessly as in the red-painted ware, especially in the earlier examples, but on the whole this pottery is very neat. The economy of ornament is also reflected in the number of patterns; horizontal bands, vertical zigzags in groups, circles and ovals sometimes with a filling of dots, rows of dots, tree patterns, crescents, hooks, vertical groups of lines and an occasional spiral whirl or a swastika exhaust the repertoire. The decoration, sparse as it is, is effective in drawing attention to the structure of the vessel; it emphasizes rim, neck, spout, handle or lug, the centre of the body, etc., and the effect is pleasing. The range of shapes is remarkably standardized and no local variations have been recognized throughout the vast extent over which this pottery spread. The Mersin jugs (Fig. I7) are so similar to those from Kanag Huiyk that they could have been imports from the plateau and perhaps they are, for we know that this</page><page sequence="31">EARLY CULTURES OF THE SOUTH ANATOLIAN PLATEAU 229 pottery was exported to the Aksaray region and to the Qargamba valley, and perhaps to certain areas of north Syria as well (see below). Bowls of metallic ware are comparatively rare among the surface finds, and few resemble those of the burnished ware (Fig. I4 : 9, 19-21). On the whole profiles are dissimilar and lips are bevelled, beaded, thickened or slightly everted (Fig. I4 : 10-17), as is but rarely the case in the burnished wares. Omphalos bases are frequent and sometimes the bulge on the interior of the bowls has a circle of paint round it (Fig. 14: i i) as in Tarsus E.B.2 (op. cit., Fig. 247, No. 200). There are a number of deep bowls or small jars (Fig. 14: 1-3 and 4-8, I8), again with lips unlike those in the other wares; and some of these may be parts of feeding-bottles (Fig. 14 : 30-32), the short spouts of which are common (cf. Tarsus, II, Fig. 247 : 199). By far the most common shapes in metallic ware are beak-spouted jugs and collar-necked jars. The latter occur in a number of sizes and shapes, often fired a brownish purple (Fig. 14 : 22-26, 33). Others have wide mouths and low necks (Fig. I4 : 34-37 ; cf. Tarsus, II, Fig. 247 : I95a, b), and a standard decoration. Most common are small jars with two lugs, a straightish neck and a sharp junction between neck and body (Fig. 14 27-29, 38-4I) and often decorated with patterns round the lugs. Larger versions of the same shape are the most frequent shape in E.B.2 and they occur by the dozens on many of the larger mounds in the plain (Fig. 16: 15-25, and eastern versions 13-14). Instead of lugs these jars have two handles of round section and on top of the handle they bear an incised mark. Handles of beak-spouted jugs show the same feature from E.B.I onwards (Fig. 15 : passim) and when a handle is found by itself it is often difficult to tell to what vessel it originally belonged. These dots, dashes or crosses may be potters' marks, for they can hardly be considered as a form of decoration. Painted decoration is seen at its best on these jars, both large and small, and on the beak spouts. Many of these jars were of considerable size, but no single complete example was found. A smallish one from Tarsus is shown (op. cit., Fig. 247 : 191, another 198). The other leading form of the metallic ware is a jug with a beak spout. Thanks to the Tarsus excavations we can distinguish two types chronologically (at least roughly so). The early type is rather tall with a pinched spout and is often decorated with red, white and orange paint (Figs. 6 : 1-7; 15 : 17 and I8 ?), whereas the later ones have channel spouts decorated with brown or purple paint (Fig. 15 : I-Io). Tarsus produces parallels for the E.B.I type (op. cit., Fig. 237: 53-56 ; painted fragments, Fig. 239 : 62-68 and Fig. 254 : 235-238) and for the later in Fig. 247 : 188-190, 192-193). To the later ones we may add the Mersin jugs (Fig. 17). E.B.2 examples from the Konya Plain are shown in Fig. I5 : 1-6, 8-Io, together with a small twin vessel (Fig. 15 : 19) and handles (Fig. 5: S1-16). Fig. 15 3 shows a complete specimen in the Istanbul Museum with an unknown provenance, but it may safely be ascribed to the Konya Plain. THE KONYA PLAIN AND CILICIA IN THE E.B.I AND 2 PERIODS In the absence of a stratified collection of Konya Plain pottery of the Early Bronze Age period, only comparative material from other regions can help us in establishing a rough chronology. Of the three main culture regions that border on the Konya Plain-the south-western region, Central Anatolia and the Cilician plain-the latter shows the closest analogies. No genetic relationship can be established with the south-western area, as is now abundantly clear after the</page><page sequence="32">230 ANATOLIAN STUDIES excavation of Beycesultan, and though we have noticed an expansion of south- western forms of pottery into the Beygehir-Seydigehir region and the adjacent eastern uplands during the E.B.2 period, the nature of this expansion (migration ? trade ?) is not clear. However that may be, in the plain itself, the immense amount of pottery does not suggest any strong south-western influence on the locally current ceramics. Of contacts with Central Anatolia we are even less well informed. The contrast between Konya Plain and Central Anatolian wares, e.g. in the two possible contact zones-the plain of Aksaray and that of Nigde-is very strong. Surface finds do suggest two quite different culture areas without any transition. In the Aksaray region two mounds, 4okyatan Haiyk on the eastern shore of the Salt Lake and Oresun Hiyiik on the road to Acigal, have each produced one sherd of " Metallic " ware, which suggests some trade. At an earlier period one would have suggested trade in obsidian, but in contrast to neolithic and Late Chalcolithic mounds, obsidian is uncommon on the E.B.A. mounds in the Konya Plain and metal had probably taken its place. When we turn to Cilicia, on the other hand, the picture is reversed and we have strong evidence for lively contact, not only with the Calycadnus valley, the main road to the south coast, but with the plain of Cilicia itself. Allowing for local variations and peculiarities such as the survival of a by now rather decadent painted pottery tradition in the Konya Plain (C ware) and a group of wheelmade wares, probably of Syrian origin, in the Cilician Plain, the remaining and by far the most common and characteristic wares in both areas are so similar as to suggest a common origin. The fact that some of these wares, like the stone-red gritty-or metallic ware, occur also together with combed and scored ware at Qal'at er-Rus XIII and XII-V respectively on the Syrian coast south of Lattaqieh and a finer version of red gritty ware in the plain of Antioch (" brittle orange ware ") led Miss Goldman, the excavator of Tarsus, to suggest a North Syrian origin for these new elements which ushered in the Early Bronze Age of Cilicia (Tarsus, II, p. 346). This was before anything was known about the archaeology of the Konya Plain, but even so it is unlikely that the red gritty ware and its leading shape, the beak-spouted jug, should have originated in Syria where this shape is unknown. The " brittle orange ware " is now considered to be imported into the Amuq, and is not a native ware. Although some Syrian elements are found in the E.B.I-2 culture of Cilicia, the wheel-made wares appear only gradually and form no part of the initial ceramic repertoire, of which the red gritty (our metallic) and the red and black burnished wares are the undoubted novelties. One could theoretically derive the burnished ware from the final Late Chalcolithic ware of FIG. 15. x. Kanag Hiiyiik. Restored jug. Brown paint on polished apricot ware. 2. Kerhane.

This is a possibility, but it should not be forgotten that the Mersin XII ware has not been found at any other site in Cilicia including Tarsus, and is most probably itself intrusive from somewhere in the Konya Plain. The case of the metallic ware is much stronger, for it is hardly credible that this ware, unique in the long history of Anatolian pottery, could have developed in two adjacent regions and at the same time, independently. The vast distribution (Fig. 6), the superior quality and the predominance of this distinct ware in the eastern part of the Konya Plain contrasts with its limited range of shapes and poor finish in Cilicia. The balance of probability suggests that it also had its origin in the Konya Plain. In the absence of cultural remains other than pottery to be used for com- parison, it seems most probable that the new elements that arrived in Cilicia at the beginning of the E.B.I period came from the Konya Plain, an area with which Cilicia had been linked more or less closely since the Early Neolithic period. Tarsus is the one site in Cilicia from which we have a good pottery sequence for the Early Bronze Age. The contemporary levels at Mersin were disturbed, at least on the excavated part of the site. Few architectural remains were found in the 8 m. deposit which at Tarsus accumulated during the E.B.I period, and the amount of pottery recovered shows clearly that we know very little indeed about this period. Three pages of pottery profiles and nine pages of photographs of sherds are all we have to illustrate the E.B.I pottery of Cilicia. The next period is much better documented and one feels on much safer ground in establishing comparisons. Between the two periods there is continuity, and continuity is also suggested by the nature of the material from the Konya Plain. The archaeologists' task would have been much facilitated by some nice burnt E.B.I mounds. Instead thick E.B.2 levels seem to blanket the earlier remains as a rule, so that most of our material is probably late rather than early. FIG. I6. x. Kanaq. Pinkish red gritty ware. 2. Karapinar I.

It now remains to be seen on internal evidence from the Konya Plain what use can be made of the Tarsus stratification to help in differentiating E.B.I from 2 in the Konya Plain. Coarse ware we can discard immediately and the late appearance of scored ware in Cilicia is in marked contrast to its early appearance in the Late Chalcolithic (stratified at Can Hasan) in the Konya Plain. The red- painted ware can only be remotely linked to that of Cilicia and on the plateau it occurs in burnt E.B.2 levels on top of the mounds and is decorated with patterns which we find also on the E.B.2 miniature lug ware of Cilicia. Moreover, the tradition of painted pottery lasted into the following E.B.3 period, whereas the " striped ware " of Cilicia hardly if at all outlasts E.B. I.</page><page sequence="37">EARLY CULTURES OF THE SOUTH ANATOLIAN PLATEAU 235 This leaves us with the burnished and the metallic wares-in both areas the main component of the pottery repertoire. The four Cilician versions of the " metallic " ware are identical with those of the Konya Plain. The rarity (in number, but not in distribution) of the plain orange-buff version painted with white, red or both paints in the Konya Plain in contrast to the masses of purple painted examples, would seem to confirm the Cilician criterion of its early (E.B.I) date. Most of the plain red pieces may also belong to E.B.I, whereas the more sophisticated beak spouts with channel spout and miniature lugs are always ornamented in purple paint, probably assignable to E.B.2, again as in Cilicia. Most of the two-handled jars decorated in the same way should be late rather than early, and the only examples from Cilicia are in fact E.B.2 in date. This apparent conformity-which should be tested by excavation-probably means that Konya Plain fashions were followed in Cilicia. The contrary may be said for the burnished wares, which in Cilicia went through a development of ever increasing ornamentation that has no parallel on the plateau. Incised burnished wares are a rarity there among the plain vessels, but their distribution is nevertheless extensive. Most of this incised ware is black and is found on cups of early Cilician E.B. I or E.B.2 type with straight or slightly flaring sides. There is a complete cup of this type from Sizma. Incised red ware is even rarer: a fine red burnished jug from Sizma repeats a shape with miniature lug, datable in Cilicia to E.B.2. Jugs like the Cilician ones appear to have been used also in the lower Calycadnus valley, at Silifke and Maltepe, but no examples are yet known from the plateau. Other incised jugs from Sizma, Ortakaraviran, Kizilviran, Yokari Cigle, Burun, Liz, etc., are of types also known in the Akgehir region and may be regarded as a local version of south-west Anatolian grooved and ribbed ones, of which there are some (Yk. Cigle and Kara H.-Akviran) in the hill zone west of the plain. We have no sherds with incised decoration that can be dated with safety before the E.B.2 period. The criterion of black versus red, the first generally early, the second more common later, which holds well for Cilicia and for numerous other regions, may to a certain extent apply also to the Konya Plain, but it is a dangerous criterion if applied without the association of shape. Straight-sided black burnished bowls and small lugs are probably earlier than the hemispherical red ones with great loop handles as in Cilicia, but it needs an excavation to define their chrono- logical limits. The rarity of black burnished ware in the Eregli-Bor ova and the great preponderance of purple painted metallic ware and some red burnished ware might suggest a relatively late date, but we are not sure. A better guide to date are the small handleless bowls, often two-coloured, i.e. one colour on the exterior and another on the interior. In Cilicia these are most characteristic of the E.B.I period, and in the Konya Plain we find their beginning in the Late Chalcolithic when they are frequently white-painted. This certainly suggests an E.B. i date and as the same shape occurs in plain red in the top layers of numerous sites, the latter is probably the E.B.2 version. These then are the only possible and tentative chronological criteria to be applied to our surface material. Further finesse in differentiation must await the publication of stratified material from excavated sites. What is clear, though, is that the Konya Plain during the E.B.I-2 periods possessed a culture which is not a mere extension of that of Cilicia, but which is marked by many features essentially its own and lacking in its erstwhile offshoot, and secondly a prosperity-at least during the E.B.2 period (and probably its R*</page><page sequence="38">236 ANATOLIAN STUDIES predecessor as well)-that has few rivals on the Anatolian Plateau. What the other achievements of this culture, deduced entirely from ceramic remains, were like, some excavation in the future will no doubt reveal, but nobody who has not tramped for week after week over the deserted remains of E.B.2 villages, towns and cities, burnt or deserted since about 2300 B.c. and never again inhabited, can quite imagine the magnitude of that terrifying destruction and desolation that literally wiped out the E.B.2 culture of this plain which long before had seen the birth of Anatolian civilisation and which again, much later during a short spell of time, the thirteenth century A.D., was destined to become the centre of the Seljuk Turkish state, the most humane and one of the most truly civilised states of the Early Middle Ages. THE E.B.3 PERIOD IN THE KONYA PLAIN As the result of the great catastrophe at the end of the E.B.2 period, which we believe was caused by the, invasion of Indo-European elements from the Pontic steppe, who introduced the Luvian language, the prosperity of the Konya Plain seems to have declined abruptly. Whereas we have a hundred E.B.2 sites in the plain alone, not more than six produced E.B.3 pottery during our survey: Kara Huiyk-Konya, Seydihan, Zencirli in the plain and Sizma, Hatunsaray and Orta- karaviran II in the western hill zone. Pottery of this period was scanty in the extreme and at Seydihan, Kara Huiyiik, Zencirli and Ortakaraviran the dating is based on red cross bowls. At Zencirli at the eastern end of the plain there were some pieces of what looks like Cappadocian ware and a few bowls of Ktiltepe II type. This is very meagre evidence indeed, but one can always argue that E.B.3 remains lie hidden below the Second Millennium sites, of which about thirty-five have been identified. Even then this is a sorry number in comparison with the density of E.B.2 villages, towns and cities, and it remains remarkable that on not one of these thirty-five sites E.B.3 wares should have appeared ! It could be suggested that we missed such wares, but now that we know from Professor S. Alp's excavations at Konya-Kara Hiiyik what pottery of this period looks like, this possibility is excluded. E.B.3 wares like those of Kara Hiiytik V-VII were not found during our survey, with the possible exception of a few pieces of painted ware from Hatunsaray, Kara HuiyUk-Akviran, Seydihan, Eminler and Zencirli, which may or may not belong to the E.B.3 class of painted ware. Similarly the bead rim bowl with W-shaped plastic handle which occurs at Kara Htiytik V and IV, i.e. on the transition from E.B.3 to M.B.A., occurs also at Sizma, at Domuzbogazliyan, at Vthiiyiik and at Karaman, all sites with Middle Bronze Age remains, so that once again we are not certain of E.B.3 occupation. There is one possible fragment of a depas in polished red wash ware from OYhtiytik. It would appear that all the characteristic E.B.2 wares are no longer found in E.B.3, but that is all we can say at the moment about this Dark Age in the Konya Plain, the obscurity of which, one hopes, will soon be dispelled by the Kara Huiyik excavations.</page></plain_text>
