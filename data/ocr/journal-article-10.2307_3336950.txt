<plain_text><page sequence="1">exceptionally arresting sculpture, I wondered if the sheer visual force of its pairing with a documented and naturalistically rendered eighteenth-century bust overrode any con- cern on the viewer's part that identifying it as a portrait is pure conjecture. The overwhelming lack of documentation for individual pieces in the exhibit severely weakened its thesis that portraiture is a central impulse in image-making in Africa. The cura- tors do make a strong case for these objects as portraits based on recent research on Benin tusks and field evidence for one specific Fon asen, which was commissioned as a portrait. But without documentation, the identification of the Yoruba Egungun mask, the Dogon stat- ues, the Baule entertainment masks, the Dan spoons, the Shango dance wands, the Chokwe maiden masks, and the Akan and Ife archaeo- logical material as portraits remains pure con- jecture on the curators' part. For example, while field evidence suggests that some, but not all, Baule entertainment masks were carved as portraits of celebrated dancers, none of those displayed were documented as por- traits. What, then, does their inclusion tell us about Baule portraiture? The curators moved to somewhat safer ground in presenting sculptures and paint- ings as historical and social documents. In this gallery, the juxtaposition of African and non-African pieces was less problematic, because the discussions of rank, class, and gender were framed in a manner culturally and historically specific to individual objects. However, I found the final gallery, "Por- traiture and Perception," very unsuccessful. In attempting to address the question of cul- turally specific perceptual systems, the labels grouped all of Africa's cultures under the rubric of "Africans" and lumped all Western societies into one regardless of period or place. The lead label in this section set off my internal alarms when it stated, "One study suggests that Africans...." At their best, the cross-cultural compar- isons should have visually stimulated and delighted the general viewer. Yet they also risked propagating false information about African objects, thereby creating false similes between not only the various African pieces, but also the African and non-African ones. Because of the historical shifts in the way Western society has defined portraiture, the complex nature of perception and image- making worldwide, and our lack of docu- mentation and field evidence for far too many of the African objects in the exhibit, the implied similarities among these objects often seemed too facile and left me with a pro- found sense of unease. The exhibition as a whole brought to mind Magritte's surrealist painting Les Trahison des Images (Ceci n'est pas une pipe). The majority of the objects included are indeed anthropomorphic images, but can we confidently state that they are all really portraits? objects that would have supported their the- sis may not have been available for loan; complex issues discussed at length in the cat- alogue may have been drastically reduced to a few general paragraphs on a text panel in the galleries. "Likeness and Beyond" thus raised the question of whether its complex topic can even be adequately treated in an exhibition. Despite its weaknesses, it offered some important insights: the cross-cultural juxtapositions brought up serious issues for scholars about the universality of art histori- cal categories, while the lack of field studies and documentation about whole groups of African objects suggested a number of critical directions for future research on the arts of Africa.

BLADES OF BEAUTY AND DEATH African Art Forged in Metal Mesa College Art Gallery, San Diego, California February 2-March 7, 1990 Reviewed by Elisabeth L. Cameron ~C(I~$I~IPbPI _. - Can knives be beautiful? Can they be art? These are the questions asked by "Blades of Beauty and Death," a recent exhibition curat- ed by Barbara W. Blackmun and Jacques Hautelet. African knifes are more than utilitarian objects for domestic use and warfare. As important items of regalia, they bestow authority on appropriate candidates. Used in rituals, they become part of a corpus of sacred arts. Blades were also used as currency throughout much of precolonial central Africa. Both functional and nonfunctional forms exist, the more elaborate having pierced and decorated blades and handles. Perhaps the best known are the throwing knives, which incorporate several blades of different shapes on the same weapon. The basic materials used are iron and copper, metals that have been worked by African blacksmiths since very early times: copper dates back to 2000 B.C., iron to 500 B.C. Because of the creative power exhibited in the act of extracting ore, of smelting it into usable iron and copper, and of shaping the metal into objects of beauty and use, black- smiths take on ritual roles and often super- natural powers in many African cultures. Although limited to one fairly small room and drawing from only a single private col- lection of African knives, this show gave the viewer a new appreciation of the knives' aes- thetic value. The exhibition layout was deceptively simple. The weapons were dis- played on stands that lined three of the walls, giving the effect of soldiers marching in step around the room. Four spectacular examples were placed in the center of the gallery. The knives were carefully arranged so that the evolution from one shape to another could be seen among just several successive examples. The room, painted a simple gray, was devoid of wall decoration, except for two photomu- rals and several didactic labels at the en- trance. This deliberately stark background was intended to focus attention on the knives as aesthetic objects. With any other design decision, the delicate and subtle beauty of the metalwork would have been lost. The constraints imposed on curators in any exhibition are severe, and must be taken into consideration in the final analysis of a show's success or failure. Documented 82</page><page sequence="2">My only criticism of the show was of its emphasis on the aesthetic aspect of the objects. Removed from their African context, the knives were redefined as art, a judgment based on Western standards. Who values their abstract beauty above all else? The answer is obvious: it is we, the American and European audiences. For the viewer who wanted to know more about the blades, a two-page handout provided only general information. One could also purchase the elegant exhibition catalogue. Aimed at the general public, it presents an overview of African metalwork and weapons, followed by striking black-and-white plates. Opposite each full-page illustration is a paragraph or two about the metalwork of the ethnic group to which the object is attributed. Several field photographs showing knives in context are also included. However, those who did not buy the catalogue were offered general- izations about metalwork in Africa. The main point of this presentation was that the knives are objects of "beauty." The fact that they are also objects of "death" was not emphasized. In the catalogue, Dr. Blackmun sums up African weapons as fol- lows: "Multivalent in usage and traditional associations, African forged weapons and currency blades are unique. Their history and former functions are appreciated today, yet it is their abstract beauty that is the most val- ued. Their spiritual dimensions elevate them above mere pieces of metal, and their aesthet- ic power qualifies them as striking works of art" (p. 8).

WEST AFRICA Powerful Patterns Kauffman Museum, Bethel College North Newton, Kansas October 7,1989-January 31, 1990 Reviewed by Robert T. Soppelsa For this exhibit, more than fifty objects from West Africa, notably Nigeria, were displayed in a small temporary gallery space in the Kauffman Museum at Bethel College. While none of the works on display could be called "masterpieces," all were good examples of their types. Contemporary and traditional artworks, all dated to this century, were dis- played side by side. Included in this exhibition were woven, painted, and resist-dyed textiles from Nigeria, Ghana, and northern C6te d'Ivoire; an Igbo dance costume; Yoruba and Hausa men's embroidered garments; wooden sculp- tures from Nigeria, including Igbo masks; an Igbo shrine sculpture of a leopard; several ibeji; an Eshu Elegba; a pair of modern Yoruba door pulls by Lamidi Fakeye; an Ifa divination tray; and two Ifa staffs of iron. A reconstruction of an Edo shrine to Olokun, several Nigerian pots, a drawing by Twins Seven Seven, a hammered tin relief by Ashiru Olatunde, engraved gourds, and field photos from Nigeria and Ghana were also on dis- play. Objects were not generally grouped by date, type, medium, or region, but rather by design considerations: those that looked good together were placed together. There were, however, exceptions to this rule: shrine paraphernalia, which make no sense unless they are viewed as an ensemble, were pre- sented in a shrine-like assemblage, and the Igbo masks and costume were juxtaposed so that viewers could visually reconstruct a masquerader in costume. All of the objects were from the collection of Kathryn Kreider, who, with the assistance of Jean Kreider Reichenbach, acted as guest curator of this exhibit. She also established the department of textiles at the University of Benin in the 1970s. Gallery notes and photos accompany- ing the objects presented their cultural con- texts and functions with, for the most part, admirable clarity and simplicity, and accom- panying gallery sheets provided greater detail. Since there was no catalogue of the exhibit, this information was particularly helpful. As stated in the exhibition notes, the premise of the exhibit was that patterns dominate design considerations in all of West Africa's arts. The curator's accompany- ing contention that pattern is separated from design considerations in Western culture may be far from universally accepted by Western artists and designers. Moreover, assuming that pattern is the controlling design factor in African arts is an over-sim- plification. Although many objects in the exhibit, particularly the textiles, relied large- ly upon pattern, most of the sculptures did not. Such statements from the gallery notes as: "To Africans, art is not something sepa- rate from life" and "Art in ancient Africa was anything that could collectively contribute to the developing individual" could have mis- led novices in the study of African culture, the people to whom the exhibit was presum- ably pitched. The objects and accompanying gallery notes would have made an admirable small show without such overblown and vague philosophical statements. In spite of these problems, the show was visually very pleasing and introduced the variety and rich- ness of the arts of western Africa, notably of Nigeria, to an area of the United States that is, by and large, sadly uninformed about Africa. G CLASSIC CONCEPTS IN AFRICAN TRADITIONAL SCULPTURE Highlights from the Permanent Collection T.W. Stanford Art Gallery, Stanford University Palo Alto, California February 20-April 22, 1990 Reviewed by Barbara C. Johnson Because of the earthquake of October 1989, which damaged the Stanford University Museum of Art enough to close it indefinite- ly, this small exhibition took place in a tem- porary space for changing exhibitions. It was a relief to learn that all the art-African and otherwise-survived virtually unscathed, a tribute to earthquake-conscious conservation techniques. Ruth K. Franklin, the acting curator of African and Oceanic art, chose twenty-nine wooden sculptures embodying what she con- siders "classic" concepts, or regularly repeat- ed forms and ideas from a particular region, that are documented in the literature and known to us in the West. She eschewed some- times more exciting pieces if they varied from this criterion. All of the pieces on display were made predominantly of wood, which, as she pointed out in the handout of label copy distributed at the exhibition, is highly perishable. We can, therefore, assume that these pieces have been "classic" for only the past hundred years or so. Each piece was documented with a couple of paragraphs briefly explaining its use, iconography (if known), and other informa- tion about the culture of origin. These labels were put together from the latest and most authoritative published sources on the ethnic groups included, a list of which was provid- ed in the handout. Interesting and concisely written, the information enhanced the view- er's knowledge and appreciation of some of the aesthetic choices the sculptors made. The installation, in a rectangular room with white walls, was clean and simple. Flanking the door was a pair of large, weathered Bamileke house posts that nicely complement- ed the scale of the entrance; between them, an inverted double screen announced the title. On the other side of the screen, which was painted pewter, were a map of Africa and an introductory statement. They were on either 83</page></plain_text>
