<plain_text><page sequence="1">603 REVIEWS THE FAITH OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. The The The Faith of the Old Testatnent. By the Rev. Alexander Nairne, B.D., Professor of Hebrew and Exegesis of the Old Testament at King's College, London, with a preface by F. C. Burkitt, M.A., F.B.A. (London, r9r4·) The book which Dr Alexander Nairne has published with the title The The Faith of the Old Testament is a work of much greater importance than might be supposed from the modest name of the series of which it is the first volume. Dr Nairne's reputation as a scholar, the position which he holds, the fact that Professor Burkitt has contributed a preface, though this has reference to the series and not to one volume in par ticular, are all calculated to produce on the layman the impression that in the present work he has the last word of English scholarship on the Old Testament, and that he has found here what he is always clamouring for, ' the assured results of the higher criticism The book therefore merits an exhaustive review; yet it presents extraordinary difficulties to a reviewer. For while its whole tone invites a devotional spirit, and thus disarms criticism, there are few pages on which the 'critical' reader will not find something which he would be inclined to modify, if not to deny. Dr Nairne seems to waver between an intention to relate what the books of the Old Testament meant to the ages in which they were produced, and a desire to tell what the Old Testament means to him in his own devotional life. When he yields to this desire, he will to a great extent carry his readers with him; when, however, he approaches the faith of the Old Testa ment from a historical point of view, he produces the impression of underrating the importance of that which, for want of a better word, may be described as 'critical' study. Not that Dr Nairne ignores the results of the higher criticism ; some of his statements might well serve as themes for critical essays: e.g. ' The book of Isaiah is a kind of "" gospel " of Isaiah ' (p. 3). Similarly, he writes (p. 56) ' How were these books of the prophets composed? How far can we trust the order of events which they indicate, or trace from their statements the developement of the prophets' minds ? How far, indeed, may we believe that we have the prophets' own words at all ? Who wrote these books ? What material had the authors ? What purpose guided them in the use of their material?' Yet Dr Nairne's book shews little evidence that he has subjected the prophetical writings to the minute scrutiny which we are all agreed must be applied to the Gospels. He</page><page sequence="2">604 the journal of theological studies maintains indeed that ' the plain man needs not to trouble much about such points ' as the date of Deuteronomy and its relation to the book of Jeremiah (p. 5 f); but even though that were conceded, it is surely of the utmost importance that 'the plain man'should not be misled. There are, however, not a few paragraphs in the book which, if intended for the 'layman', are surely misleading. Take for example the middle paragraph of p. 4, and notice particularly the latter portion of it: ' This is the J Ε style. Those symbols stand for Judaean and Ephraimite'— this is probably true, but they also stand for Jahvistic and Elohistic —'and mean that these narratives come from two early schools of literature in south and north Israel respectively, early schools which shew perhaps their noblest character in the first great succession of prophets, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah.' Would not the ' plain man' here understand Dr Nairne to mean that the prophets, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah actually belonged to the schools which produced J and Ε ? No doubt there are things in these documents with which all four prophets are in agreement; but to admit this is quite different from representing the prophets as belonging to these schools. Dr Nairne is so saturated in a 'mystical' interpretation of the Old Testament that he fails to recognize the historical significance of the most significant things. Is it conceivable that Hosea would have represented the God of Israel as giving the command ' Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac . . . and offer him ... for a burnt offering', even though the story ended with the state ment that the terrible command was not insisted upon ? Or again, can any one imagine Isaiah telling without reprobation the sordid stories of Jacob's trickery? The relation of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah is indeed of far more vital importance for a study of the faith of the Old Testament than Dr Nairne will allow. It is impossible to gain any adequate idea of Jeremiah's greatness without determining whether Deuteronomy in his days held somewhat the position of canonical scripture or not. It would be as reasonable to argue that the canonicity of the Penta teuch in St Paul's time should not be taken into account in a study of the Epistle to the Galatians. There is scarcely warrant for the state ment (p. 5) that 'the history as told in 1 Kings, and the progress of the prophets' teaching, seem to show that Deuteronomy (whatever the date and origin of its laws) first entered effectively into Israel's life in the reign of Josiah and the prophetic period of Jeremiah : Jeremiah is certainly the Deuteronomic prophet'. In connexion with this last statement it is to be noticed that on p. 66 Dr Nairne treats Jer. vii 22 f as though Jeremiah's assertion were at variance only with the Levitical law. But the words in their plain meaning are opposed likewise to the</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 605 laws of J Ε and Deuteronomy, for in all these documents, as well as in Leviticus, sacrifice is inculcated as a duty. It is, indeed, as necessary to keep the three great feasts, involving sacrifice, as to keep the sabbath. Moreover, does Josiah's reformation ' correspond so markedly with the injunctions of Deuteronomy', that Deuteronomy must be' supposed (in some form or other) to be the book of the law which was discovered in the temple and read to the king' ? (p. 43). That Josiah's reforma tion in some respects corresponds with the law of Deuteronomy may be admitted, but the correspondence is by no means so great that it must be supposed that the king definitely aimed at carrying out the injunc tions of such a book. Dr Nairne, and indeed many other scholars, overlook a fact which is of the utmost importance in this connexion. The deuteronomic editor of the book of Kings credits all the kings of Judah and Israel with the possession of the book of Deuteronomy, a fact which is surely in itself sufficient warning against following him as an absolutely certain guide in his account of the king whose eccle siastical policy most nearly corresponded to his ideal. Yet even after all allowance has been made for the narrator's desire to make Josiah conform as closely as possible to the Deuteronomic law, it is evident that the king acted in entire contravention of some of its provisions. For whether 2 Kings xxiii be regarded as homogeneous, or whether (as is probable) w. 15-20 and the last clause of v. 4 should be considered a later insertion, Josiah's actions shew a serious disagreement with the injunctions of the Law. For not only is it stated (ν. 9) that the priests of the Judaean high places were not admitted to the position to which they would have been entitled by the law of Deuteronomy (xviii 1-8), but according to v. 19f, the priests of the Samaritan sanctuaries were slaughtered on the altars which they had served, whereas the law of Deuteronomy is addressed to 'all Israel', north as well as south, and gives no hint that the Judaean priests are to have more lenient treatment than those of Samaria. Dr Nairne recognizes, indeed (p. 94 f), that Josiah did not carry out this part of the law, but he fails to notice the difficulty in the supposition that Ezekiel would have set aside an ordinance which was was accepted as Mosaic law, nor does he realize that it is at least arguable from the Elephantine papyri, which he mentions on p. 136, that the refugees in Egypt had settled there before the law of Deuteronomy was published in Palestine. It may further be pointed out that Josiah did not remove the two great pillars which stood before the temple (2 Kings xxv 16) which, though naturally in a post-deuteronomic book they are not called massebhdth, were contrary to the law of Deut. xvi 22; and Jer. xvi 6, which, whenever it was first composed, was at least published seventeen years or more after the supposed finding of Deutero nomy, is directly at variance with Deut. xiv 1.</page><page sequence="4">606606 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Another example of Dr Nairne's failure to perceive the true nature of Jeremiah's relation to Josiah's reforms is to be found on p. 74, where he writes as follows: ' We notice too how closely the earlier reading' (Dr Nairne is contrasting Ezra's law book with the book read before Josiah) ' was connected with prophecy. A priest found the book, and a scribe read it, but priest, scribe, and king, seek explanation and advice from a prophetess. The gravity of its contents was felt because they coincided with what the prophets had long been vainly urging, not stricter attention to ritual or the observance of a completer civil code, but the abolition of heathen abominations. " Thus saith the Lord," was Huldah's answer, " Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with the work of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched" (2 Kings xxii 16, 17). Huldah repeats the strain of all the prophets, and evidently found the book in thorough harmony with that strain; the whole episode breathes the spirit of early prophecy.' Here Dr Nairne passes over, without com ment, the most significant fact that the great prophet who for five years had been preaching repentance in Jerusalem is never mentioned in connexion with Josiah's reforms, and that 'priest, scribe, and king seek explanation and advice' from an otherwise unknown prophetess. If ' the whole episode breathes the spirit of early prophecy', why was Jeremiah, the true spiritual son of the early prophets, especially Hosea, not consulted ? The reason that Jeremiah held aloof from the king's plan of reform is indeed sufficiently plain, when it is remembered that, like his predecessors among the canonical prophets, he refused altogether to accept sacrifice as a divine institution. The fivefold cord of Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah vi (whoever be the author), and Jeremiah, is not easily broken. It is not mere abuses in sacrificial worship that the pre-exilic prophets have in view; Micah vi classes burnt offerings of calves of a year old with the sacrifice of the firstborn. An unprejudiced reading of Jeremiah's prophecies at once shews why the prophet is not mentioned in the story of the reformation of 621. Jeremiah indeed respected Josiah, and speaks in commendation of him (xxii 15 f), but the ground of his commendation is not that Josiah has put down the high places, but simply that he did 'judgement and justice', and ' judged the cause of the poor and needy'. A A propos of the relation of the earlier prophets to the law, it may be pointed out that the statement on p. 91, that 'the narrative in Exodus shows that long before their time' (sc. Hilkiah and Josiah) ' Moses was looked upon as the author of the law', is scarcely borne out by a study</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 607 of the prophets. In however broad a sense the term ' author' be understood in this connexion, there can be no doubt that in the so called ' book of the covenant י Moses is represented as enjoining sacrifice. But Amos asks (v 25), without fear of receiving any answer but a negative, whether Israel offered sacrifices and burnt offerings in the wilderness forty years, and Jeremiah's view of the religion of Israel during the wilderness period is the same as that of Amos ; only, whereas we should gather from Amos's words that in his days no one pretended that sacrifice belonged to Israel's religion in the wilderness, it is evident that in Jeremiah's time this assertion was being made, an assertion which Jeremiah denies in vii 22, and perhaps also in viii 8. Dr Nairne has not perceived that the statement of Deut. ν 22, to which he refers on p. 93, is in complete agreement with Jer. vii 22, 23; that is to say, whereas the set of ' words' written on the tables of stone in Exodus xxxiv represent a code which Jeremiah could not have accepted, the code of Deut. ν 22 might well have been drawn up by the school of Jeremiah. It is surely significant that this latter code occurs not in the main body of legislation, but in what is commonly admitted to be a somewhat later preface, and that, modified in the style of the Priestly Code, it is prefixed to the great body of Sinai legislation in Ex. xx. The comparison of decalogue with decalogue, in which Dr Nairne seems to see but little interest, will bring into prominence one of the most striking developements in the faith of the Old Testament, since the substitution of the decalogue contained in Deut. ν for that of Ex. xxxiv marks an advance in religious ideas as great as St Paul's discovery that' by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified'. No treatment of the book of Deuteronomy can be satisfactory which fails to recognize that chapters i-xi, if read by themselves, present a very different view of religion from that which is found in xii-xxvi: and this is the defect in Dr Nairne's treatment of it. He says (p. 96), ' If, as some suppose, Jeremiah refers to it in Jer. xi 1-8, he seems to feel just as a sincere and simple reader might feel to-day who heard of the critical disputes about it. " The law of the one sanctuary such a reader might say, " I have scarcely noticed it. I thought Deuteronomy was all about the love of God "[It may be pointed out by the way, that 'covenant' in the Old Testament frequently means a relation of peace peace between two parties (e.g. in Hosea ii 18, Job ν 23 E.V. ,league'), not a formal bargain, much less a written document, and that Jeremiah's conception of the basis of this relation of peace between Jehovah and Israel is to be found in Jer. vii 2 2,23.] No doubt, a sincere and simple reader might use with reference to Deuteronomy the words which Dr Nairne puts into his mouth; but is not this because such a person either skips the laws altogether, or, to borrow a phrase which Well</page><page sequence="6">6c8 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES hausen has used in a different connexion, sees them ' through a dense cloud of incense' which obscures their true significance ? No one who will read carefully and attentively first the prefaces to Deuteronomy and then the legal kernel of the book, can fail to be struck by the fact that there is a real difference between the parts, a difference not unlike that which exists between the epistles of St Paul and that of St James. It may be noticed in passing, that the exalted ethical precepts quoted from Leviticus on p. 97 f are scarcely to be called 'flowers of ritualism'. They represent rather that ethical teaching which is common to the best portions of the Old Testament, ritualistic and anti-ritualistic. They are indeed but another presentation of Hosea's doctrine of hesedh,hesedh, י' tender love'; yet who will call Hosea a ritualist ? A similar reluctance to see the significance of significant facts is shewn by Dr Nairne in his treatment of the historical books of the Old Testament. Thus on p. 47 he writes, 'But on the other hand the more closely we inquire, the more reason we find to believe that the prophets were right in their appeal to the purer religion of the past.' He does not state, however, that this purer religion is regarded by the prophets as belonging to the period before the conquest of Canaan, when Israel Israel served the Lord without sacrifice; and he continues, ' How is it that in Samuel we hear nothing of abominations connected with the high places?' To such a question a twofold answer may be given; first, that the oldest narratives contained in the book of Samuel origin ally took shape in circles where the practices of the high places were not considered reprehensible, and were therefore not particularly referred to; and secondly, that the book has been considerably modified to suit the ideas of later ages. Yet, even as it stands, the book contains statements which are significant enough to those who have eyes to see. The dedication of Samuel, as of Samson, to the Lord all the days of his life (1 Sam. i 11) in the light of Gen. xxii, and of Exodus xxii 29 (where the firstborn of men are claimed by God in exactly the same way as the firstlings of beasts, and permission to redeem is not given), implies a view of religious obligation which is not that of the Christian, or indeed of the later Jewish, mother. The wild raving of the prophets, as it is described in 1 Sam. x, xix 18-24, is evidently regarded by the author as a normal feature of religion, though it is primitive and barbarous enough. The words put into the mouth of David (1 Sam. xxvi 19) imply a primitive and anthropomorphic conception of God, and are not the utterance of a monotheist. We need not be ' obsessed by the idea that all early religion was superstitious' to recognize that much in the earlier religion of Israel which is uncondemned in the historical books was highly superstitious. The slaying of Agag and the dance of David, in each case described as taking place ' before the</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 609 Lord' (1 Sam. xv 33, 2 Sam. vi 14), imply a conception of the God head which is scarcely on a higher plane of religious belief than the practices at the high places. A man must resolutely shut his ears to all that missionaries and travellers can tell him, if he finds in the account of David's removal of the ark evidences of a spiritual religion. There might be difference of opinion as to the exact religious value of the solemn dance in Seville Cathedral, but there is little resemblance between that ceremony and the act of David, who ' danced before the Lord with all his might', ' girded with a linen ephod'. Some idea of what a linen ephod was may be gathered from the injunction given in Ex. xx 26. David's dance would certainly have appeared to us under the circumstances even more indecorous than it appeared to Michal. Yet Dr Nairne sees no great difficulty in the supposition that Ps. xxiv ,may have been composed for the festival of the bringing of the ark to David's newly won city of Jerusalem' (p. 181). He feels no incongruity in the supposition that the same man who, according to ι Sam. xxvi 19, regarded Jehovah merely as the God of Israel, to be worshipped only in the land of Israel, should in Ps. xxiv affirm that ,to Jehovah belongs the earth and the fulness thereof', inasmuch as ' it is He who has founded it on seas and holds it fast above streams'. Indeed, even from the merely historical point of view, Ps. xxiv does not suit the time of David. As yet no temple existed, and it is unlikely that David would have called the gates of a fortress which he had only just conquered ' ancient entrances'. The general defect of Dr Nairne's work, namely, an inability to recog nize the immense importance of discovering the meaning which words originally bore, is even more apparent in the account given of Messianic prophecy. He writes, indeed (p. 60 f), ' Look at Isaiah 9, 1-7, and especially the last two verses (" for unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given", &amp;c.), and ask yourself what these magnificent words meant when they were first written. Some have been content to say that they are a prediction of our Lord Jesus Christ. But though they are without doubt a prophecy which is fulfilled in Him, it is not a real answer to say they were, to Isaiah's contemporaries, a simple prediction of Him.' And a little later, with reference to the name which he translates 'Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace', ' Do not such astounding titles after all imply quite another kind of king than Hezekiah or his son or grandson could possibly be ? Suppose that this passage does not come from Isaiah at all. Or suppose that the full form in which we read it is due to a modification of some less daring utterance of Isaiah.' It is indeed extremely probable that one of these hypotheses is to be accepted as true ; but even so, should not a book on the faith of the Old Testament discuss what the words VOL. XV. R r</page><page sequence="8">61ο THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES did mean to the man or men to whom we owe them in their present form ? That Isaiah himself was a monotheist is sufficiently clear from his own account of his call, and few will question the monotheistic faith of the post-Deuteronomic Jewish Church. If, then, the name ' Mighty God ' was given by a monotheist to one whom he expected to be born, we naturally enquire how and why such a belief in a divine incarnation originated. It is no explanation to say that 'an older form of the prophecy' may have been ' modified for synagogue reading'. Why did the synagogue need such a modification ? There is no parallel either in the book of Daniel or in the book of Enoch. The desperate attempts made by early Jewish translators to avoid the conclusion that the child to be born is to be called ' Mighty God' are sufficient proof that some explanation is wanted of the verse as it stands in the Masoretic text. It is true that' we sing Te Deum at the end of some severe reading from the Old Testament' and attempt, alas! against all Christian teaching, to ,give a Christian meaning to a fierce psalm by adding the Gloria'; but we at least know what we understand by the Te Deum and by the Gloria, whereas, on Dr Nairne's hypothesis, the synagogue altered a phrase which was intelligible into something which, according to the sense put upon the words by Dr Nairne, must have been not only unmeaning but even shocking. It will probably be felt by many readers that in his description of the Old Testament attitude towards a future life (p. 66 f; cf. p. 186) Dr Nairne has read his own thoughts into the prophetic utterances. It is perfectly true that ,the prophets insisted that there was no place where the Lord had not dominion'; but the conclusion which Dr Nairne draws from this, viz. that in their belief ' there was no such place as Sheol at all', is certainly not warranted by their sayings nor by the Old Testament literature as a whole. One would like to know on what passages Dr Nairne bases his statement (p. 68), that, to ' Isaiah and his companions in prophecy', ' Sheol was false doctrine, cruel to men and derogatory to the Lord. In order to clear it quite away, they were reticent about life beyond the grave altogether, just as modern puritans deprived themselves of loving mention of their dead in their prayers, that they might not countenance superstitions about the state of those who had fallen asleep in Christ. There is, however, not a single word in the prophets which should lead us to suppose that they did not hold with perfect happiness the ancient and perpetual belief of true Israelites; we go to God and that is enough: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is not the God of the dead, but of the living.' If this was ,the ancient and perpetual belief of true Israelites', assuredly many of them contrived to dissemble it with considerable success. Did Ben Sira hold this belief? Or was he not a true Israelite?</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS 611 The treatment of Isaiah Hi 13—liii (p. 77 f) is another instance of Dr Nairne's unwillingness to face plain statements. It is surely only by explaining away quite unambiguous phrases, that it can be maintained that ' the servant finds life in losing it for the sake of men. He bears their iniquities, he makes intercession for the transgressors, and in their salvation salvation1 he sees his seed, he prolongs his days, though he has died a martyr's death'. The italicized words are a gloss by Dr Nairne; but is the gloss warranted—if an individual be referred to—by the trans lateable portions of w. 10-12 taken in their natural sense? In the description of the book of Job we notice the same failure to scrutinize the component parts of the book which has already been pointed out in the case of Deuteronomy. Dr Nairne is indeed willing to allow that the Elihu speeches are an interpolation, though he feels no difficulty about accepting the descriptions of Behemoth and Leviathan as genuine. This is a matter of taste. But he goes on to say (p. 113), ' As to the prologue and epilogue, there is little reason to separate them from the main poem. They are in prose, but that is natural, since they tell but the plain story.' The last sentence may be accepted as true; it is difficult to see how the mere story of Job could well have been told otherwise than in prose. But surely a reader who passed straight from the prologue to the epilogue, having never seen the poem, would conclude that the original story, of which he had the beginning and ending, represented Job and his friends in a different light from that in which they appear in the poem. In the prologue Job appears calm and resigned in spite of his successive calamities. He receives the news of the loss of property and children with the words, ' Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.' Again, when his bodily health is taken away, and his wife's fortitude breaks down under the trial, he meets her passionate outburst with the gentle rebuke, ' Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil ?' When the three friends appear on the scene, it is they, not Job, who give way to uncontrolled demonstration of grief, and become speechless with horror. If, then, immediately after this descrip tion,tion, the epilogue be read, and due weight be given to the Lord's declaration that Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar have not spoken about Him the thing which is right, as His servant Job has done, is not the inference almost irresistible that in the original story the friends had ranged themselves on the side of Job's wife, and that Job had preserved his calm resignation throughout ? This is the view of Cheyne, Jewish Religious Religious Life after the Exile, p. 160 f, a work to which Dr Nairne 1 The italics are mine.—R. Η. K. R r 2</page><page sequence="10">612 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES makes reference on p. 130. There is, however, another difference between the prologue and the poem which must be taken into con sideration. The explanation of suffering indicated in the scenes in heaven is that suffering is the way in which God tries a man and ascertains his perfect sincerity; but this view is materially different from that of the poet, who represents Job's friends as maintaining that suffering is the divine method of pointing out to a man that there is something wrong in his life which he must correct. In writing of Ecclesiasticus (p. 138), Dr Nairne makes the common assumption that the grandson of Ben Sira set to work to translate his grandfather's book almost immediately after his arrival in Egypt. This, however, is not warranted by the actual words of the prologue. It is indeed difficult to say what is meant by &lt;ητγχρονίσας. Robertson Smith was apparently inclined to accept the emendation συχνον ϊγχρονίσα^ (Enc.(Enc. Brit., ninth ed., Art. Psalms); but even if the existing text be retained, it cannot be taken to prove that the work of translation was accomplished immediately. The book of Jonah is treated by Dr Nairne with less sympathy than might have been expected. He praises the psalm contained in it, but fails to notice the application of the story to the Jewish nation, though Jer. 1 17, li 34 might have shewn him the way to it. In the account of the struggle against Antiochus Epiphanes, no distinction is made between the adherents of the Hasmoneans and the Hasidlm, though this distinction is of great importance for the right understanding of the religious developements of the time, while with reference to the stories of the book of Daniel, Dr Nairne makes an assertion (p. 172) which many will by no means accept. Ά word perhaps should be added about the stories. These, we may be sure, rest upon tradition: the author did not invent them. Whether they give us plain facts we cannot either assert or deny, except in so far as there certainly are some details, already alluded to, about which the author has made historical mistakes. That these wonderful trials and deliverances did take place there can be no definite reason to deny, except the a priori reason that they seem to us unlikely. It is not honest to pretend that this reason is a weak one. Only it must be remembered that the ultimate difficulty about miracles is not that they lie outside the path of our experience, for our experience is continually expanding ; but that it is sometimes hard for us to be satisfied that such or such a miracle is morally worth while. We cannot say that the miracles in Daniel are so well attested, or are so morally worth while, as the works of power and the resurrection of our Lord. But the ques tions which it is important that we should put to ourselves about Daniel are these—Is there anything mischievous in the idea that the</page><page sequence="11">REVIEWS 613 Old Testament should contain some examples of imaginative work? Is it necessary that in such a book as Daniel the narrative should be composed with the same conscientious search after accuracy of facts as we justly expect in a historian like the author of Samuel or Kings ? If this author made no such careful search, was the message which he delivered to his oppressed countrymen less truly on that account a mes sage from God ? י But those who refuse to accept the stories of Daniel as historical are not actuated only by objection to miracle. Is there no difficulty that Nebuchadnezzar, after being converted to the faith of the God of Israel in chapter ii, appears again as a heathen in chapter iii, and is again converted; lapses apparently in chapter iv, and is once more converted to the true faith. Dr Nairne's treatment of the Psalter is hardly adequate from a historical point of view, and some of the statements which he makes will probably be misleading to the ' layman'. Thus on p. 180 he quotes the last verse of Psalm xiv, of which he accepts the R.V. rendering:— ' Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion ! When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.' But is it certain that the translation of the second clause is correct ? Can we suppose that Job xlii 10 is rightly rendered,' And the Lord turned the captivity of Job' ? Again, on p. 182 we read as follows : י Hardly any one would contend that David wrote Ps. cxxxvii, " By the waters of Babylon Many must feel it unlikely that David, who fought, ruled, administered so well, would have also written so many psalms of such various character as are assigned to him. The difficulties about Davidic authorship multiply swiftly in the mind of every questioner among the readers of the Old Testament. It may be in one manner reverent to listen to God's words without asking questions when they puzzle us, but it is not filial. And when the words are no part of the sacred text itself, but only titles added to explain it, the human medium becomes insistent, and the reader's intelligence is all but bound to be exercised. " The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord. . . . The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness: But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want" (Prov. xx 27, xxi 5); the Wisdom of Israel is certainly on thq side of the questioner. Is it not allowable to suppose that these titles express the " mystical" interpretation of the Jewish Church ? We inter pret " mystically ", and find the Psalter richly illustrative of the life and work, the manhood and Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ. We could not possibly use the Psalter better. But our "mystical" use is no arbitrary invention of our own. It is the natural continuation of the</page><page sequence="12">614 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES use of the Jewish Church, who found their Psalter richly illustrative of the life and work of David. And David did not mean to them simply the son of Jesse, once king of Israel. The name was a sacrament. It gathered round itself a multitude of associations and aspirations. The earthly king, the series of " Christs of the Lord ", led on to a larger hope of "The Christ" who was yet to come. The Psalter illustrated the immense variety of David the " type ". And yet—this is the beauty of the idea, a beauty which we can so well understand—this type was impressed on the actual life of David the man. The illustrations are truly sacramental. What the Jewish Church saw was what we see in the light of new heavens and new earth now that the Word has been made flesh—Godhead through manhood, sacramentally. Do the titles thus understood lose or gain in sacredness ?' But can the titles be thus understood ? We may certainly admit that in many places of the Old Testament David does not mean 'simply the son of Jesse, once king of Israel'; but it is scarcely possible to deny that the name did have just this meaning to those who prefixed the titles of Pss. vii, xviii, xxxiv, li, liv, Ivi, Ivii, lix, lx, lxiii. In the paragraph quoted above, is not Dr Nairne confusing the historical sense of the Old Testament with its devotional use ? There can be no progress in biblical study till the original meaning of every sentence is boldly faced. Having regard to our Lord's explicit declaration that some of the precepts of the law were written because of the hardness of men's hearts, we are not wanting in loyalty to the Christian faith if we affirm that not only the grosser superstitions of the high places but even many ordinances which were finally accepted by all the Church of Israel were essentially barbarous. We may indeed recognize that even the crudest rites have sometimes helped to lift men to a higher plane of spiritual life, but we need not on that account shut our eyes to the superstitions out of which they arose. That sacrifice, for example, was not without its value to the Church of Israel we may freely admit, while we nevertheless insist alike on the barbarity of its outward form and the crudity of the conceptions underlying it. In these very barbarities and crudities, indeed, we possess a striking proof that the Holy Ghost 'spake by the prophets'. That the prophets should have preached what they preached, when and where they preached it, is one of the great miracles of history. Robert Η. Kennett.</page></plain_text>
