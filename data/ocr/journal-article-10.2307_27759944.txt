<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 19 The Survival of the Goddess with Upraised Arms: Early Iron Age Representations and Contexts by Mieke Prent Large, wheelmade terracotta figures of the so-called goddesses with up raised arms form a recurrent and distinctive feature of cult assemblages in the Postpalatial bench sanctuaries of Crete, as shown by examples at Knos sos, Gazi, Kannia, Gournia, Karphi, Kephala Vasilikis, and Halasmenos.1 In the Late Minoan (LM) IIIC cult building at Vronda, building G, no less than 30 of these large terracotta goddess figures were found, together with 17 snake tubes, 22 kalathoi, and 26 plaques.2 As is well known, bench sanctuaries with these specific cult assem blages ceased to exist after the LM IIIC period, when their role as com munity sanctuaries in the heart of the settlement was taken over by other types of cult buildings that centered on different cults.3 Certain elements of the earlier cult complex survived, nevertheless, into the Early Iron Age and later periods. Persistent characteristics included the use of benches for the display of cult objects and votives, the use of kalathoi as offering bowls, and the continued production of wheelmade anthropomorphic figures for dedication in sanctuaries.4 The reasons for the survival of elements such as benches and kalathoi may have been more practical than cult-specific. In other cases, however, the question arises as to whether an iconographical link was preserved with earlier religious concepts and beliefs. This question is applicable especially to the continued appearance, in different forms and contexts, of the central image of the cult assemblage associated with the Post palatial bench sanctuaries: that of the goddess with the upraised arms. The observation that the image of the goddess continued to appear is by no means new. In an important article published in 1958, Stylianos Alexiou discussed both the precursors and the successors of the LM IIIC figures, and Geraldine Gesell added other examples in her 1985 book Town, Palace, and House Cult in Minoan Crete. Different interpretations of the pose exhibited by these figures have been proposed, among which the idea that it signifies the epiphany or appearance of the deity to the worshippers remains an attractive one.5 Regardless of the chosen interpretation, it is clear that the large terracotta figures of Postpalatial times were represen tations of goddesses that were objects of veneration and dedication. The gesture of the figures must have been meaningful, as the arms and hands were emphasized by their disproportionately large size.6 1. For overviews, see Gesell 1985, pp. 41-46; 2000, pp. 499-503. 2. Gesell (1995,1999, 2001,2004) has noted that such objects were made and dedicated in sets, thus shedding light not only on the mechanisms of dedication and social organization of cult at LM IIIC Kavousi Vronda, but also in other Postpalatial bench sanctuaries. 3. Most notable are the Early Iron Age hearth temples, where cult often seems directed at male divinities; see Prent 2005, pp. 467-469. 4. Gesell 1985, pp. 57-59.

In this paper I discuss these representations in groups according to find context. It may be possible, accordingly, to gain further insight into the various forms and perhaps into the reasons for the survival of an image with such clear ancestry in the Bronze Age. POSSIBLE GODDESS FIGURES IN THE IRON AGE There were important changes in the form and utilization of the god dess image in the Iron Age. While it is clear that the production of large, wheelmade, anthropomorphic figures for dedication in sanctuaries con tinued after the LM IIIC period, most examples seem to depict votaries rather than deities. The form, gestures, gender, and attributes of these later figures vary. Bodies range from thin and tubular to short and squat, while 7th-century examples often combine rather amorphous cylinder-shaped bodies with moldmade heads. Arms, if indicated at all, are attached to the body. On the whole, there is little evidence for the articulation of these anthropomorphic figures as deities either through size, special care in execution or decoration, the use of cult symbols, or other attributes that refer to a supernatural status.7 Among the few possible exceptions is a Protogeometric terracotta head, an isolated find from Piskokephalo in eastern Crete. It is of unusual janiform type, no less than 29.5 cm tall as preserved. Boardman proposes that the larger and more carefully modeled of the two faces represents a female divinity and the smaller one a possibly less important, male divinity.8 At Vrokastro, in the area of Mirabello, three anthropomorphic heads of Geometric date are associated with a cult deposit from the upper part of the settlement. These heads have facial features that are very reminiscent of the LM IIIC figures. Hayden, in her restudy of the material, interprets one of them as female and considers the possibility that it belonged to a cult image.9 Another possible exception, this time of 7th-century date, is the finely made Palladion from the sanctuary on the acropolis of Gortyn. With a height of 36 cm, this figure is small compared to the LM IIIC goddess figures, but the bell-shaped skirt, well-articulated upper body, and detached arms recall the form and proportions of the earlier goddesses with upraised arms. The gesture, however, is markedly different, as only the right arm is raised. The clenched fist in all likelihood held a spear.10 Among the few later wheelmade anthropomorphic figures that may represent divinities, there are two instances that might seem to perpetuate the old gesture of upraised arms. The first is a chance find from Kalocho rio that consists of a terracotta head with an undecorated tiara. The facial features are strongly reminiscent of LM IIIC figures, but the figure prob ably is of later date.11 The second is the partially preserved 7th-century figure found on the bench of a small cult building at Pachlitzani Agriada, Kavousi, probably in use from the Protogeometric to Classical periods. The traditional plan and the use of a bench to display cult objects qualify this shrine as a late example of a bench sanctuary This suggests the possibility 7. Examples can be found in sanc tuaries at Axos, Gortyn, Kato Syme, Anavlochos, Lato, Siteia, and Praisos; for further references, see Prent 2005, pp. 400-403. 8. Boardman 1961, pp. 101-103, 106, fig. 41, pis. XXXV-XXXVI; Gesell 1985, p. 58. 9. Hayden (1991, pp. 139-142, figs. 12-13) suggests a connection with LM III head vases rather than with the goddess with upraised arms figures. For a discussion of the find context of the Vrokastro figures, see Prent 2005, p. 427. 10. The discovery of a matching terracotta helmet strengthens the identification as a warrior goddess or Athena; see Rizza and Santa Maria Scrinari 1968, p. 161, pi. XL 11. See Alexiou 1958, p. 214, pi. I':3; Gesell 1985, p. 58. Rethemio takis (2001, p. 99) dates it to the Sub minoan period.</page><page sequence="3">THE GODDESS WITH UPRAISED ARMS 233 of the late survival?especially in rural and more remote areas of Crete?of much older cult forms. Unfortunately, only the pedestal of the figure, the feet, and the hem of the skirt have survived.12 At present, one can only conclude that there are no certain examples of figures of goddesses with upraised arms that served as central images in sanctuaries of the Early Iron Age. For examples of the preservation of the gesture, we have to turn to representations of females on a smaller scale: bronze and terracotta figurines, along with depictions on vases and metalwork found in sanctuaries, settlements, and tombs. REPRESENTATIONS IN DIFFERENT ARTISTIC MEDIA There are a number of possible goddess representations in varying media from different kinds of sanctuaries. A Subminoan example comes from the suburban Spring Chamber at Knossos. It consists of a terracotta figurine in a cylindrical model (Fig. 19.1) that was part of a larger group of ter racotta objects dedicated at the spring long after the Minoan palace had been abandoned. The small cylindrical model, no more than 9 cm high, is a type of object more often encountered in domestic cult assemblages in the preceding Postpalatial period. The figurine clearly raises its arms, and the hands are emphasized with painted dots, thus preserving a conceptual link with the large Postpalatial figures. Many kalathoi were found among the pottery offerings, as in the earlier bench sanctuaries.13 Four terracotta figurines with crescent-shaped upraised arms, akin to phi- and psi-figurines of Mycenaean type, were discovered at the sanctuary on the acropolis of Gortyn; these have been broadly dated to the Submi noan/Protogeometric period (Fig. 19.2).14 Like the Spring Chamber, the sanctuary at Gortyn has yielded other votive objects with resemblances in form and function to the cult objects found in earlier bench sanctuaries. A number of terracotta cylindrical stands, presumably for offering bowls, are the functional equivalents of the Postpalatial snake tubes, while several of the many kernoi are composed of stacked kalathoi.15 Three terracotta female figurines from the Eileithyia Cave at Tsout souros, unpublished and therefore of unspecified date, are similar to the ones with crescent-shaped arms from Gortyn. A fourth figurine from Tsoutsouros displays the gesture of upraised arms while sitting sideways on an equid with pack-saddle.16 The latter type is also found twice among the Protogeometric B to Orientalizing votives from the open-air sanctuary at Ayia Triada. From the same votive deposit there is a third, unmounted terracotta figurine with uplifted arms.17 In bronze, there are a Geometric female figurine from the sanctuary at Kato Syme (Fig. 19.3) and a smaller one of Protogeometric date from the Phaneromeni Cave (Fig. 19.4).18 In addition to the 14 examples above, there are further examples of figurines from settlement contexts, probably deriving from domestic shrines. Two terracotta figurines are known from Geometric houses in Phaistos. The arms are not entirely preserved, but they were probably crescent shaped like the examples from the sanctuaries at Gortyn and Tsoutsouros.19 12. Alexiou 1956. 13.

Such a distribution might be taken to indicate a relatively widespread adherence to the traditional image of a female deity with up raised arms. At the same time, it should be emphasized that these figurines form only a small proportion of the total number of known votive figurines. Especially at larger sanctuaries, terracotta figurines may occur in hundreds, but indications of gender are often indistinct and gestures are diverse.23 Figure 19.1 (top, left).

The arms of the figurines from Kato Syme and Phaneromeni Cave, for instance, point forward rather than up. Thus, it is difficult to make a clear distinction between figurines with uplifted arms and a larger group of figurines, mostly in terracotta, whose arms extend forward or sideward.24 As Rethemiotakis has noted, the later figurines with upraised arms have few characteristics that set them apart from figurines depicting ordinary worshipers.25 Some wear tiaras like the large Postpalatial figures, but these are no longer adorned with cult symbols. The gender of the figurines is not always clearly indicated and some, such as a bronze figurine with helmet from Ayia Triada, are more likely to be male than female.26 These two trends, the decreasing articulation of the gesture and the extension of its use to males, indicate a loss of earlier conventions. In ad dition, the emphasis on the pubic area and breasts of the figurines from Kavousi may mean that these were specifically concerned with female sexuality or fertility, aspects that were never explicit in the Postpalatial goddess figures. From the Protogeometric B period female figures with upraised arms also appear on more elaborate metal dedications, as on votive shields from the Idaean Cave, Phaistos, and Palaikastro. These were of Near Eastern craftsmanship or inspiration. The nude females are depicted as part of larger compositions and raise the arms to hold wild animals or plants, in an Oriental-style adaptation of the old gesture identifying the females' particular function as Potnia Theron.27 From the far western to the central regions of Crete there are a smaller number of 10 representations of females with upraised arms found in fu nerary contexts. Subminoan instances are lacking, but they occur regularly beginning in the Protogeometric B period. One of the three figurines in corporated in the well-known ring vase from the Protogeometric cemetery at Kourtes clearly displays the traditional gesture,28 as does the figurine in the Protogeometric B cylindrical model from a looted tomb in Archanes 24. Others are of even more schematic, cruciform shape, see, e.g., D'Agata 1999b, pis. LXXVIII LXXXII. 25. Rethemiotakis 2001, pp. 142 143. The gesture is less ambiguous on a 6th-century B.C. terracotta votive plaque from Papoura and figurine from Lagou, both in Lasithi; Alexiou 1958, pp. 277,284-285, pi. ir':l,4. 26. D'Agata 1999b, p. 173, no. E 1.9, pi. CIV. 27. Another well-known example is the bronze cauldron stand from the Idaean Cave, on which a female with upraised arms is shown next to a war rior aboard a ship (Alexiou 1958, pp. 281-282, pi. IA':1). In this case it is hard to decide whether the gesture denotes divine status or is to be under stood in a more specific narrative context. 28.

Prent, after Stam polides and Karetsou 1998, p. 268, no. 336 THE GODDESS WITH UPRAISED ARMS 237 As on some of the bronze votives from sanctuaries noted earlier, there are also a number of representations from tombs in which the gesture is used in connection with a PotniaTheron holding plants or animals. Well known examples are the figures painted on a Protogeometric B urn from Knossos36 and on a 7th-century urn from Aphrati (Fig. 19.10).37 Recent excavations at Eleutherna add a Protogeometric B bronze shield and a 7th-century gold cutout plaque (Fig. 19.II).38 CONCLUSIONS Clearly, the use of the image of a female deity raising her arms can be traced throughout the Subminoan to Orientalizing periods, but the mode of expression shows significant variation. The largest number of such im ages consist of small votive figurines from public and domestic sanctuaries. These tend to show a mere repetition of the old form without highlighting or articulating either the gesture itself or the divine nature of the figure involved, perhaps attesting to a loss of emphasis and meaning. On the other hand, the more ornate metal dedications, such as the Protogeometric B and later bronze shields, exhibit signs of a new interest in and experimentation with Near Eastern prototypes. The most convincing evidence that the image was given a new lease on life, however, is to be found in the multifarious representations of females with upraised arms from funerary contexts. Compared to the examples from sanctuaries, these display a greater variety in material, style, and type of representation. The total number (10) of such representations from tombs may be smaller than the quantity from sanctuaries, but in contrast to the latter, they present a dominant iconographic theme. There are few other recurring figurative representations, either in the form of figurines, scenes painted on pots, or in metalwork.39 This growth in popularity and revival of a traditional image took place, not surprisingly, at a time of enhanced societal and cultural change. Ar chaeological evidence shows the emergence of a new social order, an increase in overseas contact, and a rise of interest in the legendary or heroic Minoan past. As Nicholas Coldstream has shown for Knossos, craftsmen working for an elite sought inspiration in locally discovered Bronze Age larnakes 36.

Perhaps there was a wish to entrust the dead to the care of an ancestral goddess, who was represented as displaying a gesture known of old. It is even possible that these images were connected with Persephone, a goddess whose yearly descent to Hades and subsequent return to earth symbolized the cycle of death and life.41 Although firm evidence for a Bronze Age origin of this goddess is lacking, the familiarity of Hesiod with the Eleusinian myth of Demeter and Persephone suggests that it was already "a well-known and ancient story" in his time.42 Regardless of the name (or names) of this goddess, the main point to be made here is that an old image was both adopted and adapted, and thereby it was given new relevance in a changing world. 40.
