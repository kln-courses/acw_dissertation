That invisible being who escapes from sight into the mysteries of his booth, the deus ex machina of film exhibition. Charles Le Fraper, 1912 (Le Fraper n.d., 150) The scenes he brings to life and which enrapture the audience bring him no praise. He is never applauded, never mentioned, and yet it is thanks to him that we can amuse ourselves in safety. A good machine operator could be pro- moted no less than the camera operator, by naming him for example on the film's poster, like his colleagues the set designer, the assistant director, the orchestra conductor, the soloists, etc. A tradesperson can also be an artist, can exercise the same degree of taste and skill. His colleagues the cinema owners have every reason to promote these modest technicians. They would profit from it, because people would know that at certain cinemas everything is sure to go well and be well presented by such-and-such an operator. Jacques Ducom, 1924 (Ducom 1924, 470) 'A New Race of Degenerates,' one H.F. Hoffman called them in the U.S. tradejournal Moving Picture World in 1910; 'greasy and smutty.' Tribal spec- imens' of the machine operator, or projectionist, were on view, he related, every morning at the film exchanges, procuring films for another day's work projecting them in the nickelodeons. There one could witness immoderate laughter at puerile wit, horse-play, wrestling matches on linoleum well-moistened with tobacco juice, crap shooting, hasty consump- tion of cigarettes, whittling of furniture with penknives, pounding, back-slap- Framework Spring 2002 Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 40-75 Copyright ©2002 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, Michigan 48201-1309</page><page sequence="3">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43. 1 ping, a breaking out at the mouth of profane gibberish and loud demands for the immediate delivery of reels (26 February 1910). This invective was both a salvo in the battle then raging to unionise operators and obtain fair wages and recognition of their skills, on the one hand, and thinly veiled xenophobia on the other. Hoffman invents nick- names for the protagonists of his account, men like 'Spaghetti,' 'Muz- zletoff,' Tork and Beans,' and 'Rhymo the Monk,' who speak with the stereotypical 'dis an' dať of the recent immigrant. Later that same year the City of New York brought in regulations requiring all operators to be native born or naturalised citizens; Billboard estimated that half the city's 1000 operators would be thrown out of work (15 October 1910). The law was later rescinded, but only after many operators had lost their jobs and left town. Storefront cinema owners in the U.S., upon whom no such legisla- tion weighed, were also overwhelmingly immigrant; in 1908 authorities in New York, Bioscope reported (9 October 1908), determined that over ninety per cent of the city's then 180 nickelodeons were run by 'foreigners and incompetent people.' Asked by Hoffman to account for the behaviour that made the film exchange like 'no place on earth' between 11:00 a.m. and noon daily, an exchange employee offered: They're Nutty, just plain Nutty. This is the only fun they have. All the rest of the day they are shut up in their hot 'coops,' Sundays and all, and it gives them 'attic trouble' {Moving Picture Worlds November 1910). On this score Hoffman's informant was absolutely right: during the storefront cinema era (c. 1905-1912) the operator's working conditions were appalling. These conditions, and falling wages throughout the period, led to the formation of the first trade unions in the film industry: not on the film set, but in the projection booth. It was from this foothold in the film industry that I.A.T.S.E. (which was known from 1915 until the 1930s as the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employes [sic] and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada), began organising in Hollywood studios in the late teens (Ross 1941, 8). But the operators' unions were concerned not only with the working conditions and pay of their members; they lobbied governments and waged public information campaigns around safety issues (for the operator and the pub- lic alike) and attempted to stake out a position for the operator in the film industry as a skilled artisan whose equipment and performance were essen- tial to the film production process. Whereas the projection apparatus visible and audible at the back of the hall had been another of cinema's 'attractions' for the earliest film audiences at temporary or itinerant venues, with the move to dedicated 42</page><page sequence="4">The "Machine Operator" storefront cinemas the operator and his machine began to be walled off from public view. He (apart from the occasional precursor1, women were absent from the trade until the First War in England) usually worked alone (except in England, where assistant operators were common in larger halls) for long hours at a stretch, confined to a cramped, stifling hot, poorly ventilated, asbestos-lined booth. Complaints that these booths lacked run- ning water, a toilet, or even a stool were common. Today we would view these booths, which receive no mention in histories of the motion picture 'apparatus,' as little more than coffins. A Paris by-law of 1908 stipulated that they be a minimum 1.6 by 1.36 metres, or approximately 5lA by 4 Vi feet (Kress n.d., 96); the law was viewed as 'Draconian' by some exhibitors. In this space were housed the projector, tools and supplies, reels of film, and the operator. In England, pre-fab projection booths which met municipal fire codes were popular; a 1908 Bioscope advertisement offered two sizes, 6 feet by 4 and 4 by 4 (18 September 1908). In the U.S., F.H. Richardson urged in the first edition of his Motion Picture Handbook in 1910 that the booth be at least '7 feet square by 6 feet in the clear from floor to ceiling,' although he acknowledged that this latter measurement - the height of a man standing upright - was difficult to obtain in the nickelodeon, where the booth often took the form of a loft built over the lobby (Richardson 1910, 54). (For a floor plan of a typical nickelodeon, see Hulfish 1911b, 177.) This, however, will prove to be the ideal spot for the role we will ascribe to the operator. Management usually made little attempt to provide a decent working environment in these sweatboxes. In 1910 Bioscope commented that booths were rarely ventilated to the out-of-doors, even though in most cases this would not have been difficult (17 November 1910). In Paris, the code stated simply that the booth should be ventilated to the out-of-doors 'when- ever possible'2; this provision was revised in 1927, when out-of-doors venti- lation became mandatory, and the minimum booth size was expanded to eight cubic metres (Guimpel-Levitzky 1939, 6-10). Operators protested these conditions, and even the existence of the booth itself, complaining that while authorities regulated the design of the projector and booth for fire safety, they neglected the conditions of the booth and the qualifica- tions of the operator. It was a myth, they maintained, that most fires started when the inflammable film passed in front of the carbon lamp; fires unre- lated to the projection mechanism itself were more common. These were started, for example, in film laying about unspooled on the floor, or by operators smoking in the booth or being inattentive to the lamp. The booth may have served to protect public safety by containing fires, but with no provisions in the law for ensuring proper safety practices and the con- ditions of the booth kept out of public view, it also served as a breeding ground for fires - and a fire trap for operators. This is how the French trade 43</page><page sequence="5">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 paper Ciné-Journal described the death in 1911 of an operator with four days' experience: [Antoine] Schmidt had to enter his booth by way of a trap door in the floor, which was reached by scaling a ladder. Once inside, he closed the trap door. A veritable fire trap. (4 March 1911). To one U.S. operator, writing in a letter to Moving Picture World in 1908, the booth was both unnecessary for the protection of the public and harmful to the operator's health: Nowadays an operator must take out a license after having passed a rigid examination [this practice was far from universal at this early date]. He is then considered to be capable of properly handling his machine. Then the machine, after having been equipped with every known device for protecting the film, is inspected and passed by the underwriters and pronounced fire- proof by the fire marshal. What, therefore, is the necessity for the booth? If it is for the purpose of impairing the health of the operator, it is certainly fulfilling its mission. Let the operator cleanse his nostrils with a clean handkerchief after a hard day's run. Black, isn't it? ... . Let him examine the top of the lamp-house, body-board, etc., for traces of carbon dust after the run. It's there, isn't it? The operator is constantly breathing this carbon dust . . . . It is . . . highly injurious to the lungs, throat, and membrane of the nose. From this irritation may result pneumonia, pleurisy, tonsillitis and chronic catarrah [sic] of the nose. (29 February 1908). 3 Furthermore, in this operator's view, the operator was not an unskilled manual labourer, as management insisted while it drove down wages, but rather, as Jacques Ducom suggested in the epigraph to this article, a skilled performer: Just so long as the law compels the operator to work in a booth, just so long will he be the most poorly paid individual in the ranks of professional enter- tainers (29 February 1908). In storefront cinemas the operator's duties were many. (In other ven- ues of the period, such as the English music hall, where films were a sec- ondary entertainment in a larger venue, the operator's duties were more circumscribed.) As Nickelodeon described in 1909, these included not only operating the projector but also the house lights and the 'barker' loud- speakers, cuing musicians, projecting song slides and slides between films, and rewinding and repairing films (March 1909). (To this we could add, for example, repairing non-standardised and imperfectly-designed projec- tors and working with such experimental and no doubt cantankerous tech- 44</page><page sequence="6">The "Machine Operator" nology as the synchronous sound systems that came on the market in 1907: the Gaumont Chronophone, the Hepworth Vivaphone, and a handful of other even less successful systems.) As another commentator wrote in Nick- elodeon shortly afterwards, 'the operator is more or less responsible for the whole house' (June 1909). For his part Ducom compared the operator to an airplane pilot because of the range of tasks he had to carry out in quick succession with only two hands (Ducom 1924, 445). Alongside these tasks were two chores which could not be neglected for a moment whenever a film was being projected: tending the carbon arc light (to ensure a good quality image and prevent fires) and turning the crank to propel the film through the projector. Flicker was a constant prob- lem throughout the period, and only a good beam of light and skilled han- dle-turning could minimise it. And the 'first-class' operator, it was said, would in addition vary the film's speed in order to obtain or heighten the intended effect of individual sequences in the film. But first class or not, no operator could avoid the strain and monotony of hand cranking. Depend- ing on the make of machine, anywhere from 70 to 120 turns of the handle were required every minute a film was being projected only to maintain a minimum speed of 16 frames per second, which was regularly exceeded. After a ten- or twelve-hour working day in a storefront cinema, operators were said to move their arms convulsively in a cranking motion in their sleep (Musser 1990, 441). Despite the operators' pivotal importance to the storefront cinema, the corresponding ignorance of the workings of the trade on the part of many cinema owners, and the explosive growth in the number of cine- mas4, wages generally dropped and working conditions deteriorated dur- ing this period. This paradox was most apparent in the U.S., which saw the most dramatic growth in the number of cinemas alongside the most con- certed attacks on the status and pay of operators. In 1909 Moving Picture World offered a practical explanation of this phenomenon, suggesting that the trade's high wages at the outset of the storefront cinema era attracted droves of unskilled workers willing to learn on the job for less money but who inadvertently drove down the high wages they sought (6 March 1909). Ten months earlier the same journal, which offered opera- tors and cinema owners a free labour exchange service, had advised that it could no longer place operators, even though six months prior it had been unable to keep up with demand (9 May 1908). This flood of mere 'crank pushers' into the ranks of operators helped drive wages down and ensure that program quality would suffer and fire safety be an issue throughout the storefront era. At the same time another, ideological account can be offered of this campaign against the operator. Cinema owners were clearly unwilling to acknowledge the operator's skills and pre-eminence in the hall. Prema- turely, in the late aughts, even before the introduction of dual motor- 45</page><page sequence="7">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 driven projector systems of standardised construction and operation and the advent of feature films and the abandonment of the variety format, management simply willed projection to be an unskilled mechanical chore with corresponding status and pay when this was clearly not the case. Here is Views and Film Index (later Film Index) , owned by the producers Vitagraph and Pathé, summing up the management position in 1908 in response to labour agitation, unionisation drives, and operators' claims for their status as skilled artisans: What is a moving-picture operator? An employee for a certain purpose. Noth- ing more and nothing less. The fact that he carries in his pocket a license granted by any city or town in no way changes the situation . . . He is an employee, and as such should know and keep his place. These statements are called for in consequence of numerous reports made by exhibitors that they have a great deal of trouble through operators assum- ing the position that their licenses give them more privileges than those enjoyed by the men who have invested capital in the shows (6 June 1908). But even this anti-labour tirade had to acknowledge the exploitation of operators then taking place: While on the topic let us give the exhibitor a hint regarding his own actions. The operator is a human being, not an electrical motor or other mechanical device. He must eat, rest, and sleep. Do not deprive the operator of his meals or needed rest. Put yourself in the operator's place (or booth) and act accordingly (6 June 1908). What exactly were the wages of the storefront cinema operator? In England a greater number of situations and conditions existed. There, some operators truly were only 'handle pushers' for two hours an evening in a music hall; machine and film maintenance were handled by the house electrician, who would sometimes also assume projection duties in the evening for an additional 10s per week. Wages for full-time operators in England, Bioscope reported in early 1909, ranged from £1.5s to £3.10s (4 February 1909). Later that year an operator wrote to Bioscope to complain that although he considered £3 a fair wage for a normal week's work, a max- imum salary of £2 was possible, and this only by working double shifts of 14-15 hours per day (28 October 1909). By 1911-12, Rachael Low reports (Low 1949, 70), salaries averaged 25-30s per week; in 1910 Bioscope had deemed 30s a fair wage, comparing it favourably with the 35-42s made by skilled tradespeople such as plumbers and electricians for reputedly longer hours (28 April 1910). In France, unionised operators commanded 60-70 francs per week in 1910, while non-union operators earned 40-45 francs ( Ciné-Journal 31 December 1910). In early 1911 the French operators' union vowed to halt the decline in wages and to enforce a minimum daily wage of 10 francs ( Ciné-Journal 21 January 1911). 46</page><page sequence="8">The "Machine Operator" "Operators We Have Met: The Novice," The Bioscope, September 16, 1909. 47</page><page sequence="9">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43. 1 The situation in the U.S. was more extreme. There, continuous projec- tion from early afternoon until late at night was more common, and a small cinema would employ only one operator, being spelled off for short breaks by the owner or another employee. In 1908 an experienced operator com- manded $25-$35 per week, but a year later, precisely after the number of cinemas in the country had grown at a fantastic rate, operators were com- plaining of wage offers of as little as $14 per week {Moving Picture World 19 June 1909) ; earlier that year a wage of $10 was reported in Georgia ( Moving Picture World 27 February 1909) . It seems everyone was getting in on the act: already in 1907 a letter writer to Moving Picture World complained that in Cincinnati two union delegates in their own trades - a carpenter and a pipe fitter - had opened a nickelodeon and were paying operators $9-$ 10 per week, far less than the $25-$40 sought by professionals there at the time: These men are champions of union labor. They draw a salary from their unions for getting their men union wages, but when they become employers themselves their lofty principles are sacrificed to the most sordid claims of human nature (28 September 1907). By 1911, when David Hulfish published a sample nickelodeon budget for aspiring entrepreneurs, a weekly wage of $18 was considered adequate for a 'high-class' operator (against $18 for the singer, $15 for the pianist, and $5 each for the usher and cashier). Weekly receipts in this model budget, it is interesting to note, totalled $340, against expenses of $214.50 (Hulfish 1911b, 183): a healthy profit for a minimal capital investment by someone more likely than not without any experience or expertise in the trade, and one that hardly justified economising a few dollars on the oper- ator at the expense of the quality of the show and the possible safety of the audience. In November of that year Baltimore operators struck in an attempt to enforce the following wage scale: $12 for less than five hours per night; $16 for eight; $18 for nine; $20 for 10; $22 for 11; $24 for 12 hours with a one-hour break (a work day of less than 12 hours, it appears, did not merit a one-hour break); and $24 for 13 hours with two one-hour breaks ( Billboard 2 December 1911). To strike for $24 for cranking films 78 hours per week in a hot, cramped, poorly ventilated booth - and not be paid it by someone with no special skills or knowledge but who earns $125 per week, in Hulfish's example, on an investment of about $2000! (Indeed early exhi- bition sector profits provided future Hollywood moguls such as Adolph Zukor with their first massive capital accumulation.) But fair wages were impossible to enforce in the open shop environment of the storefront cin- ema. In its report on the strike, Billboard noted with some satisfaction: So far none of the picture places apparently have suffered, the places of the employees who quit [sic] being quite readily filled (2 December 191 1) . 48</page><page sequence="10">The "Machine Operator" In September 1908 operators in Chicago struck for wages of $22.50 for one operator tending one machine and $20 each for two operators tending two machines (a novelty at the time). Chicago was the country's largest exhibition market - in 1910 the social reformer Jane Addams esti- mated that one-sixth of the city's exploding population crammed into its 466 cinemas every Sunday night ( Nickelodeon 15 June 1910) - and the oper- ators threatened to close down those that didn't pay union rates. They were joined by the song slide singers, who sang free of charge on the side- walk outside the cinemas to encourage people not to enter ( Bioscope 16 October 1908). The city's nascent 'Nickel Theatres Operators' Union' cre- ated slides to be shown before song slide and film presentations, assuring patrons that 4 the employees of the house belong to the actors' union [I.A.T.S.E.] and that the theatre is 'fair' {Moving Picture World 19 Septem- ber 1908). In 1917, I.A.T.S.E. would adopt a union label to display in cinema box offices informing patrons whether or not the operator was unionised (Baker 1933, 80). If management's assault on the status and wages of the operator was as much ideological as practical, the aim being not only to cut expenses but to assert the rights of capital, as Film Index so succinctly put it, the campaign to organise operators was equally so. Nascent operators' unions in France, England and the U.S. all devised remarkably similar strategies, with varying degrees of success, for negotiating with management and for appealing beyond management to the public, to government authorities, and to other sectors of the film industry. In each case the battle was fought on the basis of one fundamental principle, that of the status of the operator as a skilled artisan and vital participant in the production of cinema. The operators' early appeals to management carried a conciliatory, corporatist message of partnership between capital and a labour elite. In many cases, the workers concerned were seasoned operators from the pre- ceding 'showman' era of film exhibition who were unused to being treated like industrial labourers. The pitch was simple. By paying a few dollars more management could be sure of professional projection, which meant every- thing from punctual, reliable operators who didn't smoke or drink on the job to properly maintained films and equipment to a high-quality presen- tation, full of crowd-pleasing effects and free of flicker and broken films, not to mention fires. A good operator would pay for himself many times over in satisfied patrons, as Ducom suggests. The corollary, as Jean Mariani, head of the French union noted, was that 'a bargain always ends up being very expensive' (Ciné-Journal 18 June 1910). There were a few hopeful reports from the operators' unions that this common sense business proposition was getting through. In 1908 the San Francisco union, perhaps the first operators' union formed anywhere (it began in 1904 as an independent 'protective association' and after 1907 became an I.A.T.S.E. local) , claimed that exhibitors were 'willing to pay the 49</page><page sequence="11">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 association schedule of wages ... in order to obtain reliable men ( Views and Film Index 25 April 1908). But for the most part management would have none of it. In the first place, as Michael Chanan points out in his discussion of British operators, 'the audiences came anyway' (Chanan 1976, 41), what- ever the quality of the show. Exhibitors were making handsome profits offering a poor-quality show, and didn't need organised labour telling them how to improve it nor want to formalise the operator's privileged sta- tus as the only skilled worker in the storefront cinema. The proletarianisa- tion of the operator was essential to the growth of the exhibition sector and to the development of a standardised cultural commodity which could be run through a projector by practically anyone, questions of equipment maintenance and the quality and safety of the show aside. We have come to call this commodity the classical cinema, and it is not by coincidence that it was being codified during this period of the shift in the status of the oper- ator from performer to proletarian. Stymied by the exhibitors, operators appealed to film producers and distributors in their campaign for recognition as a vital link in the film pro- duction process. This strategy was in some instances doomed a priori by the film industry's vertical integration. Pathé, for example, was both France's largest producer and its largest exhibitor. It could hardly be expected to be sympathetic to operators' appeals for recognition as skilled workers when those appeals were explicitly tied to unionisation and standard wages. This did not prevent the French operators' union, the Opérateurs Ciné- matographistes de France, founded in 1908, from articulating a highly cor- poratist rhetoric of co-operation amongst the sectors of the industry. It envisioned the film industry as composed of four partners: producers, dis- tributors, exhibitors, and operators, and in 1908 invited the other three sec- tors to a debate on exhibition ( Ciné-Journal 26 November 1908). There is little evidence that they were taken seriously: capital, not labour, was to provide all the partners the industry required. A similar corporatist rhetoric emerged in the U.S., where operators publicly called on the producers' Motion Picture Patents Company and the distributors' Film Service Association to take a stand on the mistreatment and poor projection of their films by unskilled operators ( Moving Picture World 25 July 1908 and 10 April 1909), but there is no record of any response to this call or indeed of any concern for these issues beyond the operators and a few columnists in the trade press. And while no less a fig- ure than Charles Urban in England, as reported in an operator's letter to the editor, could declare that fires were caused by operators, and not faulty or unsafe equipment ( Bioscope 17 December 1908) - which was precisely the union's position, as it sought to force unskilled and underpaid 4 crank pushers' out of the profession - there is nothing to suggest that this trans- lated into Urban supporting the operators' campaigns for recognition. 50</page><page sequence="12">The Ä Machine Operator77 With the failure of this strategy the operators' campaign came to focus on the question of government regulation and licensing of operators. Operators' unions in all three countries lobbied hard for such measures, arguing that in addition to the quality of the show, public safety was at stake. Operator licensing would also protect unqualified operators from them- selves: in 1911 a 16-year-old boy was electrocuted in a booth in Virginia ( Billboard 23 December 1911). In 1909 in Marseille an operator with three days' training - a dishwasher lured by wages of three francs per day, which had just been slashed from 10 by the exhibitor - was responsible for a fire that spread from the booth and caused a stampede ( Ciné-Journal 1 1 Octo- ber 1909). Two weeks earlier, the union had noted with indignation two other fires ( Ciné-Journal 27 September 1909) just after the Paris Prefect of Police had ignored operators' appeals to include licensing in new munici- pal regulations for film exhibition. The union complained bitterly that it had not even been allowed to appear before the Technical Commission that drafted the legislation and heard recommendations from sectors of the industry ( Ciné-Journal 11 June 1909). Even some exhibitors could not fail to see the benefits of a licensing scheme for operators. As late as 1911, on the heels of another fire, in the booth of a novice operator in an itiner- ant cinema, one French exhibitor asked a very simple question: 'When will operators be required to have a licence demonstrating their ability, like an automobile driver?' ( Courrier Cinématographique 2 September 1911). Still the government took no action, even as it required owners of large halls, for example, to have a doctor on duty at all times, and the union was left to certify its own members - on the basis of work experience and references and not, as in England, through a practical examination - before folding later that same year, unable to enforce wage scales or to obtain favourable legislation. A similar story of government inaction and weak unions played out in England, where the National Association of Cinematograph Operators (N.A.C.O., affiliated with the National Association of Theatrical Employ- ees, N.A.T.E.), was founded in 1907. From the beginning N.A.C. О. began lobbying the London County Council (L.C.C.) to include operator exami- nations and licensing as part of its regulation of film exhibition. At various times in 1907-08 the union and a sympathetic trade press hopefully announced that they were confident of convincing the L.C.C, to examine operators or to recognise the union's own certification exams ( Kinemato- graph and Lantern Weekly 1 August 1907 and 30 January 1908). But the L.C.C, quickly dampened these expectations. In a February 1908 interview its technical expert declared that such examinations and licensing should be dealt with by a national bill ( Kinematograph and Lantern Weekly 6 Febru- ary 1908). But when the national Cinematograph Act appeared later that year, it was completely silent on all matters relating to operators5. Nation- 51</page><page sequence="13">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 wide safety regulations now existed concerning the booth and the projec- tor, but a blind eye was turned to the problem of unskilled operators using this equipment. Management lobbying against operator licensing had been vigorous, as it was widely seen as the thin edge of the wedge of union- isation: 'unionisation by Act of Parliament' was one management riposte to calls for licensing (Low 1949, 67). In France, the union made no bones about this being their aim {Ciné-Journal 31 December 1910). Deprived of the organising tool that licensing would have provided it, N.A.C. О. languished as a tiny and ineffective union. In mid-1910 it acknowledged that it had only 200 members, and not the hoped-for 2000 ( Bioscope 21 April 1910). Rachael Low suggests that the following year was good for recruitment and that it reached 1000 members in 191 1, but points out that this was still a fraction of the total number of operators in the coun- try, where there were at least 4000 dedicated cinemas (Low 1949, 70). In that year, when N.A.C.O. issued yet another call for compulsory licensing, Bioscope lamented that in this regard the British film industry lagged 'far behind the U.S.' (19 February 1911). It was in fact in the U.S., surprisingly perhaps, that operators had the most success lobbying for licensing, although obviously this was carried out at the municipal or state and not national level. Widespread licensing did not necessarily translate, however, into the hoped-for growth and bargain- ing power of the operator unions. By June 1910 I.A.T.S.E. locals had been formed in only 18 U.S. and Canadian cities; while no figures are available for total membership in these locals, it must have fallen far short of the 10-15,000 operators at work at the time ( Film Index 25 June 1910). Initially authorities in the U.S., like their counterparts in Europe, were content to license cinemas, inspect projectors, and set out safety regula- tions for the construction of the booth. Some municipalities even required cinema owners to hire a municipal fire fighter at their own expense to be on duty during shows. But as early as 1907, in Massachusetts and Illinois, state-wide licensing of operators began to appear. New York followed in early 1908, by which time there were bills for operator licensing before 33 state legislatures ( Views and Film Index 21 March 1908). Operators com- plained ( ! ) , however, that the licensing exams were not rigorous or techni- cal enough, or even carried out by competent examiners. In any event, despite impassioned calls for a nation-wide operators' union ( Moving Pic- ture World 14 December 1907 and 8 February 1908; Views and Film Index 23 November 1907) , this remained an impossible dream at this time in a coun- try as large as the U.S. and an industry with such a dispersed workforce. Michael Chanan argues that in England the failure of operators to organise in great numbers was due to their being in the wrong union: an old-style 'craft' union rather than a modern 'industrial' union (Chanan 1976, 15ff). Chanan claims that operators would have been much more 52</page><page sequence="14">The "Machine Operator" successful in their attempt to unionise had they spearheaded the organisa- tion of skilled and unskilled workers alike in individual cinemas, and cites one such case on the eve of the war, where everyone right down to the 'Chocolate Boy' was organised. Individual cinema owners were vulnerable to threats of being shut down, Chanan suggests, and willing to come to terms with the union in order to stay in business; organising one or two operators in each of several thousand cinemas, he points out, was a logisti- cal nightmare. Now, it is hard to argue the merits of a strategy which had at best lim- ited success against those of one untried, but that is what I will attempt to do. Chanan is certainly right about the organisational challenge of the 'craft union' strategy, but it is by no means certain that the alternative he offers would have been any more effective in the long run. Unskilled work- ers are difficult to organise - they come and go, are easily replaced, and often lack the consciousness which would drive them to join a union. Small workplaces of mainly unskilled workers are also easily decertified, by hook or by crook. And when they are organised, often very little headway is made on wage demands, precisely because they are unskilled and in plentiful sup- ply. Chanan' s own example from 1914 is a case in point. Moreover, it is unclear how such a strategy would favour the spread of unionisation in the industry (individually organised small businesses have little opportunity to 'infect' similar operations), or what the bargaining strategy and success of the operator would be once he identified himself as nothing more than an industrial worker: this was management's position in seeking to drive oper- ator wages down from 'craft'-like levels. Operator unions - 'old-style craft unions' - did however impose them- selves eventually in many countries. Here again the U.S. led the way, despite a lesser tradition of labour militancy and unionisation than Europe and seemingly greater logistical challenges: the number of cinemas, their geographical dispersion, and the industry's fantastic growth, which actually created a need for unskilled operators, there being not enough skilled operators to go around. Here the operators' strategy was to organise on a city-by-city basis, calling boycotts of non-union cinemas where skilled oper- ators were at work and where the union thought it could prevail over the owner. The San Francisco union reported its success with this tactic ( Views and Film Index 21 August 1909). Hope no doubt existed that once a critical mass had been reached, individual cinemas would begin to fall into place. To a limited extent, they did, in the U.S. at least. This then is the same tac- tic that Chanan urged, to confront the vulnerability of individual cinema owners, but here it was focused on the linchpin of the operation, the skilled operator. Chanan may be right on one point, however, although not in the sense he intended, and that is that the far less successful British operators may 53</page><page sequence="15">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 have been in the 'wrong union.' Wrong in the sense that the N.A.C.O. was simply not a very militant or effective union, as Chanan himself documents in detail. But this should not necessarily lead us to conclude that the 'craft union' strategy was in error. It does however suggest an interesting issue, highlighted by the bitter jurisdictional disputes over operators between unions in the U.S. and especially the U.K. Industrial and stage performer unions in both countries claimed him as one of their own6. What, in fact, was an operator? A semi-skilled industrial worker, or a modern-day stage artist? No one could agree. In France after the war, exhibitors and the elec- tric company couldn't even agree on how the cinemas' electricity should be tariffed: was the projector an industrial machine or a light source? (Rosen- blatt 1998, 47-9) . Operators in all three countries devised a common and highly visible strategy to overcome the obstacles to collective action imposed by their pro- fession: they appealed to the industry's burgeoning trade press, and found there a remarkably warm reception. In the U.K., the journal Kinematograph and Lantern Weekly offered itself as the nascent union's official organ as early as its first issue on 16 May 1907 and proceeded to provide an active and par- tisan representation of operators' interests. The largest trade journal in the U.K, Bioscope , founded in 1908, provided more restrained coverage of oper- ators' activities, but endorsed the licensing of operators (17 January 1909) and gave ample coverage to union activities, training schools and technical issues, and operators' letters; at one point the union proposed as a benefit of membership a free subscription to the journal, paid for by the union and apparently in exchange for the publication of union business in the journal (9 September 1909). In 1910 Bioscope published a technical manual, The Modern Bioscope Operator ; one of a score published before the war in these three countries, but that same year became the 'official organ' of the Cine- matographic Defence League, a management lobby group. During this period the journal became less and less sympathetic to operators' grievances and especially to their wage demands (28 April 1910) . The leading trade journal in France, Ciné-Journal , launched in 1908, editorialised against a perceived 'anti-union prejudice' among operators themselves (6 October 1908) and opened its columns to union leaders to make the case for licensing, standard wages, and operators' grievances. When the union folded in 1911 because it had been unable to enforce a standard wage or to instigate industry-wide improvements in working and safety conditions - precisely because it was not a union per se but a volun- tary association with no effective power over management - a new journal published by Charles Le Fraper, the Courrier Cinématographique , took up the call. Le Fraper offered to 'pay all the costs of an Association of Cinemato- graphic Operators [the defunct union's leader, Jean Mariani, predicated the group's rebirth on banishing the word union and doing away with dues] and to provide it with office space.' Recognising the difficulty in get- 54</page><page sequence="16">The "Machine Operator" ting operators together to discuss their common problems, he added: 'Dis- cussions will be carried out in the columns of the journal, and we propose today to assign to one of our editors the daunting task of centralising forces' (11 August 1911). The very first issue of what was to become the most important U.S. trade journal of the period, Moving Picture World (9 March 1907), contained letters from activist operators appealing for 'Fair Treatment of the Opera- tor' and 'An Operators' League.' The editor noted at the foot of these let- ters: 'We are quite willing to allow The Moving Picture World to be the official organ of the league and to report its progress from time to time.' The jour- nal's masthead identified it as 'The only Independent Weekly Journal pub- lished in the interests of Manufacturers and Operators,' reflecting the operators' desire to be accepted as a partner in the industry. Throughout the storefront period the journal offered a free labour exchange for oper- ators and exhibitors; published operators' letters; editorialised in favour of licensing, unionisation, and better treatment and wages; and published a regular technical-cum-editorial column by F.H. Richardson, the operators' most vocal and influential advocate in the industry. Moving Picture World too recognised its unique power to bring dis- persed operators together. In an editorial of 18 May 1907 it noted: 'We would like to get a meeting of those interested . . . but as the operators are too far apart for such a meeting to take place, we must perforce resort to our columns for the elucidation of ideas and suggestions.' And yet within a month (29 June 1907) the journal had become the 'official organ' of the Moving Picture Exhibitors' Association - the very cinema owners the oper- ators were constantly at loggerheads with - and after that date it can be seen visibly struggling to juggle its official duties and its sympathies with the operators. In December 1907 it editorialised in favour of compulsory licensing, but its clarion call no doubt smacked too much of unionisation for management's tastes: [I]f the whole of the known 5,000 operators would join hands they would command recognition in the Federal Union under a separate and distinct flag of their own, and secure the elimination of the careless operator (14 December 1907). II. - Is there any real necessity for you? What are you? A hand that turns the handle. Couldn't they do without this hand? Couldn't you be eliminated, replaced by some piece of machinery? - I smiled as I answered: In time, Sir, perhaps. . . . But the most serious dif- ficulty, at present, is this: where to find a machine that can regulate its move- ments according to the action that is going on in front of the camera. Because I, my dear Sir, do not always turn the handle at the same speed, but faster or slower as may be required. I have no doubt, however, that in time, Sir, they will succeed in eliminating me. The machine - this machine too, like all other 55</page><page sequence="17">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 machines - will go by itself. But what humanity will do then, after all the ma- chines have been taught to go by themselves, that, my dear Sir, remains to be seen. Luigi Pirandello, 1916 (Pirandello 1926, 7-8 [translation modified slightly] ) Pirandello's paean, at the close of the storefront era, was to the camera operator, not the projectionist, but it might very well have included the lat- ter. If taking speeds varied widely throughout the 'silent' era, projection speeds varied more so; sometimes carelessly, sometimes deliberately. The motivations for varying taking speeds, between and even within films, were numerous. Fluctuating light levels on cloudy days could prompt the cam- era operator to vary the taking speed on the fly to prevent over- or under- exposure. D.W. Griffith under-cranked, at times to as little as 12 f.p.s., in order to squeeze more story line into a single reel of film (Brownlow 1990, 285). And, in the absence of fully developed 'classical' editing and acting codes (Pearson 1992, passim) , the taking speed would be varied in order to accentuate the effect of individual sequences. Later, the avant-garde would exalt deliberate under- and over-crank- ing: Dziga Vertov called for the abolishment of a standard speed (Vertov 1984, 14-15 and 41) and Louis Delluc, in a posthumously published article dating from the early 1920s, described the camera operator as an anony- mous artist, just like the creators of ancient temples and medieval cathe- drals: 'Here workers discover the path to art' (Delluc 1985, 176). Earlier, in 1920, Delluc had also called for projectionists who would demonstrate the virtuosity of concert pianists in their rendition of the film's rhythm7, reminding us of Ducom's claims for the projectionist a few years later in the epigraph to this article. Delluc was no doubt unaware of it, but this virtuos- ity was precisely what projectionists had claimed for themselves during the storefront era a decade earlier. Machine operators everywhere were regularly criticised for projecting films at the 'wrong' speed. So widespread was the practice, and so familiar were audiences with the phenomenon, that in 1910 Lux would release a comedy, Bill as an Operator , which played on improper cranking to achieve its comic effects. Here Bill, while flirting and daydreaming, first under-cranks, then over-cranks, and then runs a reel backwards, to the alternating mirth and chagrin of the audience, both of the film-within-the-film and the Lux film. Bill as an Operatoria a good example of what I'd call merely situational variations in cranking speed: operators inattentive to the image or wanting to get home early, for example, and there seems to have been no shortage of these. But while the public and large parts of the trade press usually blamed the operator for this kind of mis-cranking, usually he was following a man- agement directive: sometimes to stretch films out so as to have to rent fewer, but much more often to race through them in order to turn the audience over more frequently while being able to advertise an extensive program. 56</page><page sequence="18">The "Machine Operator" Another impetus for increased projection speed might be described as cultural, wherein the cinema, through its action, its editing, and its faster- than-life taking and projection speeds, was a prime vector and emblem of the new century's modernity, expressed as speed and motion. Walter Kerr argues that over-speeding created an aesthetic which 'took the labor out of life and gave its gestures a new and delightful buoyancy' (Kerr 1975, 35). While we will dispute his conclusion below, it is true that throughout the silent period films were consistently projected faster than they were shot. And different versions of the same film were prepared, for example, for rural and urban markets in the same country - curiously, it appears that rural areas preferred the medium's unadulterated speed, while 'padded' versions, with superfluous scenery edited into the action, were destined for the urban market ( Bioscope 27 November 1908). If confronted with a ver- sion ill-suited to his audience, an exhibitor or operator could always rem- edy the problem through under- or over-cranking. Projectionists' cue sheets, indicating the speed at which specific sequences of a film should be projected, were first introduced in the U.S. in 1916. (In the 1920s in France, Marcel L'Herbier devised the cue sheets for his own films, so important did he view the proper speed to their effect; later in life he lamented the passing of hand-cranked projectors, com- menting that he felt like a pianist deprived of his sharps and flats) (Sadoul 1975, 84). Before that date, projectionists were entirely on their own in determining the original taking speed and matching it. Moreover, it was widely agreed not only that camera operators failed to maintain a steady and uniform cranking rate at their end - which latter-day research has con- firmed8- but that any given film's narrative would be so imperfectly con- structed as to require the projectionist's intervention to improve upon the taking speed in order to render the film's desired effect. F.H. Richardson, one of the most eloquent advocates of this view, cites D.W. Griffith as hav- ing approved of the projection of The Birth of a Nation (U.S., 1915) at faster than a life-like projection rate9, and attributes to him the comment that the machine operator was 'in a large measure . . . compelled to redirect the photoplay'10. This was the almost unanimous view of the period's technical specialists writing in the projection columns and manuals read avidly by novice and seasoned operators alike - and not a few managers - in all three countries under study here11. Here for example is Jacques Ducom, writing in 1911 in a book Jean Mitry describes as one of the first books of film history (Mitry 1969, 9), but which I prefer to view, along with the first edition of Richardson's hand- book in 1910, as one of the first books of film theory: The intelligent and artistic operator will immediately sense if he is above or below the speed at which the scene should be projected. All he has to do then is modify his speed to that which best suits the results the film is trying to give. 57</page><page sequence="19">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43. 1 "Operators We Have Met: The Boy," The Bioscope, October 28, 1909. 58</page><page sequence="20">The "Machine Operator" It is even possible that he will have to change speed several times during the same reel (Ducom 1911, 296). And the author of the other epigraph to this article, Charles Le Fraper, writing in 1912: Nothing is more elastic than the speed at which a film should be projected. Various factors are at play ... an intelligent operator will base himself above all on the subject represented (Le Fraper n.d., 51). Here is Bioscope in England in 1910: If possible, run your new program of films through once in private, so that you may be familiar with the subjects as they follow on, and so be able to adjust speed and light to the advantage of each subject (18 February 1910). Variable projection speed was perhaps most warmly embraced in the U.S. Here is David Hulfish in 1911: The sentiment of the picture may be watched and speed may be used accord- ingly, the operator turning more rapidly where he deems the action of the picture could be improved thereby. The manufacturer should have timed his action when making the picture, but sometimes this is neglected (Hulfish 1911a, 54). And Henry C. Horstmann and Victor H. Tousley, writing in 1914 or 1917: If there is sufficient time, it would be well to run the film through the machine in the regular way. Thus the operator can familiarise himself with the picture and note every place where improvements can be made by adjust- ing the speed, for very often a picture may be improved by slowing down or increasing the speed in certain scenes (Horstmann and Tousley 1917, 105). The last word goes to Richardson, from the 1910 and 1912 editions of his handbook: Speed must be left entirely to the discretion of the operator. . . . Theoreti- cally, the machine speed should be the same as that of the camera which took the picture being projected, but in practice this is often far from true. The camera man grinds out at a set speed, supposed to be sixty feet per minute, though he often varies widely from the mark. The actors act the scene as seems best to them, but ofttimes when the scene is projected it is discovered that they have misjudged the speed of action necessary for best effect. Right here is where a really good operator who closely watches such details becomes of great value, helping out the scenes amazingly merely by changing speed on different scenes (Richardson 1910, 103). [T]his is . . . one of the finer points of projection. It is this which lifts the real operator out of the class of the ordi- 59</page><page sequence="21">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43. 1 nary mechanic and makes him something of an artist (Richardson 1912, 319). Herein lay the key to the operator's artistry and indispensability: his ability to improve the picture, to convey sentiment or story that its maker intended but did not successfully pull off. The whole enterprise rested on the infernal hand crank that the operator turned tens of thousands of times a day. And yet, mid-way through the storefront cinema era, a device appeared on the market that promised to improve his working conditions immeasurably, even as it would reduce his stature by compromising this essential role in the film production process: the motor-driven projector. The first motor-driven projectors appeared on the market in 1908; in December of that year a machine manufactured by the American Moving Picture Co. was approved for use in New York City {Moving Picture World 5 December 1908), and by 20 May 1909 Bioscope in England was writing as if they had become common enough equipment in the booth. And yet they clearly did not take over the market: Pathé didn't introduce a model until 1911, two years after its popular hand-cranked Professional model, and columnists continued to write about hand-cranked machines, even pre- dominantly, for many years to come (of course, small storefront cinema owners would not necessarily run out and buy a motor-driven machine to replace their perfectly good hand-cranked one if its only benefit was to save their operator some back-breaking work ....). In fact by 1916 only 50-75% of projectors being manufactured (not those already in use) were equipped with motor drives (Richardson 1916, 273) . And yet latter-day film historians have not asked when and why the transition to motor-driven pro- jectors took place12. The authors of trade paper columns and projection manuals almost unanimously warned against the motor-driven machine, arguing that it would tempt the operator away from the machine and allow him to neglect his duty to constantly monitor the light, framing, focus and speed of the image. The biggest problem however was the danger of fire. Municipal authorities feared that if the operator wandered off the film might combust with no one around to notice. In 1911 Hulfish could write that motor- driven machines were prohibited in 'most' U.S. cities (Hulfish 1911a, 128), making it unclear just how widespread their use was before the war. But didn't operators herald this new invention, lobby for its approval, pester their bosses to buy one? Apparently not. And what of their defend- ers, who had long championed their right to decent working conditions and who deplored their daily lot? Here is Richardson, their most steadfast supporter, writing in 1912: I would very much like to see the operator relieved of the drudgery of crank- ing the machine, but I am of the opinion, strengthened by close observation, 60</page><page sequence="22">The "Machine Operator" that, aside from the danger involved from the operator not being right there in an operating position, projection almost invariably suffers, at least to some extent, when the motor drive is used (Richardson 1912, 366). Now, there is something doubly curious about the introduction of motor-driven projectors during the storefront era. Not only did they remain secondary to hand cranking throughout the period, but motor- driven machines did not entirely eliminate the possibility of varying pro- jection speed. A standard feature of the new machines was to provide sev- eral, usually five, fixed operating speeds. But this required that an entire reel be run through at one set speed or another. The Pathé and Gaumont projectors introduced in 1911, however, advertised 'six gradually variable speeds' (Pathé) and a 'speed governor' (Gaumont), making hand-like speed regulation possible ( Ciné-Journal 30 September 1911), and almost from the beginning a U.S. firm marketed devices which enabled gradual speed variation with motor-driven machines, with Bioscope instructing its readers on how to jerry-rig one on their own (30 May 1909). Convinced, perhaps, of the efficacy of variable speed regulators, or simply resigned to the eventual triumph of the motor-driven machine, Richardson proposed a solution in the 1912 edition of his influential hand- book. Pulled in different directions by his desire to improve operators' working conditions and the fundamental belief that speed regulation was the sine qua non of their artistry and role in the industry, he proposed the following: a platform should be constructed alongside the projector, on which the operator would stand while working. Inside the platform, itself 'locked shut by the manager or, better still, sealed by the city inspector,' would be placed two copper plates. When the operator stood on the plat- form these would touch and complete the electrical connection that drove the projector. If he stepped off the platform, the connection would be sev- ered and the machine would grind to a halt. 'By this plan,' Richardson observed, 'the operator would be absolutely anchored right there beside his machine, where he should be, every moment the machine is running' (Richardson 1912, 366-7). By 1916 he was able to report that a similar sys- tem, using a spring, had been adopted by law in the state of Massachusetts (Richardson 1916, 274). The artistry of the operator was tied, as he was, to his machine. He spent so much time alongside it, crank handle in hand, that it had almost become a physical appendage, and he must have known its rhythms like those of his own body. (Hulfish comments that ' [t] he operator's hand upon the crank is the doctor's finger on the pulse of the patient' (Hulfish 1911a, 55) - ready to remedy any defect visible in the film's narrative - and Richardson, with intended or unintended humour, entitled his chapters on the booth in the editions of his handbook published in the 1910s 'The Operating Room.') With this plan Richardson proposed to chain the operator to his machine 61</page><page sequence="23">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43. 1 Ad in F.H. Richardson, Motion Picture Handbook: A Guide for Managers and Operators of Motion Picture Theatres (New York: Moving Picture World, 1916). 62</page><page sequence="24">The xx Machine Operator" while 'relieving him of the drudgery' of hand cranking. The operator was still able, and poised, from his vantage point hung over the lobby of the storefront cinema, to descend like a deus ex machina to complete the film production process with a turn of his wrist upon his machine. III. An instrument of labour is a thing, or a complex of things, which the labourer interposes between himself and the subject of his labour, and which serves as the conductor of his activity. . . . Relics of bygone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the investigation of extinct economic forms of society, as do fossil bones for the determination of extinct species of animals. It is not the articles made, but how they are made, and by what instruments, that enables us to distinguish different economic epochs. Karl Marx, 1867 (Marx 1967, 179-80) In 1943, in the first paragraph of the notoriously 'fascist' second edition of their history of the cinema, Maurice Bardèche and Robert Brasillach - no followers of Marx - nostalgic for the silent cinema of their youth, remi- nisced about that faint noise similar to rain pattering on a roof that was the cranking of the film in the operator's booth. For twenty years this was the real accompani- ment to films (Bardèche and Brasillach 1943, 11). Some years before, Vsevolod Meyerhold had written of his own experience of the storefront cinema: Sitting in the semi-darkened room, we hear the ticking of the projector, and are constantly reminded of the passage of time. It creates a special mood; it makes us aware of the existence of time (Tsivian 1998, 121). To an intellectual like Meyerhold, the sound of the projector may have evoked the passing of time; to the working class audiences of the storefront cinema, I contend, it would have sounded more like industrial labour. After arguing in the previous section of this article for a view of the machine operator as an artist, in this third and final section I would like to suggest ways of thinking about him not as a factor in an 'aesthetic of reception,' in Yuri Tsivian' s phrase, but rather as an element in a collective process of industrial production. While we might consider this figure, who has 'escaped from sight' into his booth at the back of the storefront cinema, an incongruously invisible deus ex machina, this, I will argue, is not truly the case. The audience, whether he was visible and audible to them or not, was constantly aware of his presence through the visible signs of his labour on the film; in fact he was more visible than any other instance of the film pro- duction process. 63</page><page sequence="25">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 In light of the argument made by commentators of the day that the operator had an indispensable role in conveying the film's story to its audi- ence, we might be tempted to range him alongside the bonimenteur, or film commentator ('lecturer' is too narrow a term), or perhaps alongside the contemporary theoretical construct of the 'film narrator,' whose first appearance, we are told, was in the films of the storefront period. In the former instance we might even hypothesise a succession from the showman commentator to the storefront operator. In each case I believe the com- parison would be misleading. Unlike the commentator, the operator did not offer explicit extra-diegetic commentary, but altered the presentation of the film itself in a gesture both less explicit and more fundamental, as we shall see. And can the operator be described as carrying out the work of the 'film narrator'? Tom Gunning locates the birth of this figure in D.W. Griffith's films of the storefront era, a period that also coincides precisely with the first signs of what other scholars have labelled the 'Institutional Mode of Representation' (IMR) or the 'Classical Hollywood Cinema.' Gunning comments that the narrator's task is to 'coordinate a realistic diegesis within a coherent space and time through the functions of tense and sus- pense' (Gunning 1991, 190). He further describes the narrator system as a 'series of tasks in the realm of tense. . . . Tense in film involves the tempo- ral marking of shots in relation to each other' (Gunning 1991, 26). We might be tempted to argue that the operator is an element of this narrative system, one its advocates have overlooked - Gunning admits only the profilmic, the 'enframed image,' and editing (Gunning 1991, 19-20). We have heard, for example, comments to the effect that a film's story line could be 'helped' by the manipulation of the film's representation by the operator; how the film's 'subjects' (narratives) could be shown to 'better advantage' through this manipulation; that film producers 'often neglect to properly time their action,' leaving it to the operator to correct; etc. We might even argue that the process of regulating a film's speed, of showing certain sequences faster than others, could be a form of 'temporal marking of shots in relation to each other' (Gunning of course cites editing as the privileged site of this operation), a primitive form but an essential one nev- ertheless, if films were reaching the operator in the booth with an imper- fectly constructed narrative. That this was the case, incidentally, is demon- strated by André Gaudreault, who cites a trade press article from 1908 {Moving Picture World 8 February 1908) which claimed that only one film in fifty was adequately understood by viewers (Gaudreault 1999, 151). There are problems with this argument, however. Gunning describes the film narrator as a narrative system and not a flesh-and-blood on-screen presence and rejects the charge of 'anthropomorphism': the 'narrator,' rather, is a 'theoretical entity' (Gunning 1991, 24). The operator seems to 64</page><page sequence="26">The "Machine Operator" be too much of a live figure, and especially so in my account, to fit into such a system. We would have to renounce, at a minimum, all that I have argued above concerning the visibility of the operator's interventions in the film: one of the defining characteristics of the narrator system, as for the IMR and the classical system, is its invisibility to the audience. Even then, we must conclude that the operator is simply too concrete, too particular, to be adapted to such a theoretical construct: Gunning is emphatic that the 'narrator' is only virtual, not actual. Moreover, to abstract the operator in this way would also be contrary to my own aim, which is to situate this very real figure in a system of indus- trial commodity production. Whatever the shortcomings of my own argu- ment until now - and these are only going to become more spectacular - I can't help but think that this inability to locate the operator within narra- tor theory reverts to problems with that theory itself, problems the figure of the operator can bring to light. A general comment on narrator theory first of all: here is a curiously Kantian enterprise to be imposing on early cin- ema! The criticism of anthropomorphism is off the mark; rather, what else can the 'theoretical' narrator be other than Kant's universal subject? In this light Gunning's assurances that his system does not do away with the need for an active viewer take on new meaning: what the spectator is actively doing is seeking confirmation of his or her own subjectivity in the text. The text functions to place the subject in the world, and this is part of the oper- ation and appeal of the whole 'classical' film narrative system: we don't just read the text, we are read into it. In this sense Gunning's narrator suggests the 'spectral other who walks beside you' in The Waste Land evoked by Terry Eagleton in his critique of Kant (Eagleton 1990, 72-3) . The narrator is a fig- ure through whom all the heterogeneity and centrifugal energy of early cinema seem betrayed to concern with authorial narrative intention. This emphasis on the hermetic world of film narrative at the expense of everything that lies outside it, exhibition practices perhaps foremost among them, is all the more surprising given Gunning's plea elsewhere for this world-outside-the-film in early cinema: [0]ur object of study is not the film as it was produced, but the film as it was used, exhibited, made to carry meanings, understood - as it acted upon peo- ple and was acted upon itself (Gunning 1992, 110). And yet narrator theory is concerned with authorial intention, with signs of authorship, with meaning inscribed at the moment of production and with reading a seemingly hermetic text. In his study of Griffith Gunning even describes, in a chapter title, Griffith's films of 1908-09 as 'complete and coherent films, self-contained commodities.' Yet even if such a narrative coherence was being produced at the time, it was surely being undermined 65</page><page sequence="27">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 at the level of exhibition. If the comment attributed to Griffith himself is correct, that the operator is 'compelled to redirect the film,' then we are faced with an acknowledgement of narrative incompletion, of the existence of untold thousands of producers of the same film, each necessarily with his own version, by the father of Gunning's film narrator. And by filming as slowly as 12 f.p.s., Griffith was positively counting on the operator's inter- vention in his films. This intervention served not only to advance the still-experimental narrative of the IMR: it had at the same time the opposite and paradoxical effect of reverting to an earlier aesthetic of 'attractions.' Here we will adapt an observation by Gaudreault, who with Gunning is the principal theorist of the film narrator. Gaudreault remarks, à propos of the early chase film genre (c. 1903-06), that while a linear narrative is clearly being established here - the first such generic instance in film history - an aesthetic of 'assembled distinct attractions' remains visible: the films 'retain something of the strictly centripetal specificity of the self-sufficient unit characteristic of films composed of just one shot' (Gaudreault 1999, 33). Isn't this pre- cisely the effect the operator of the storefront cinema would achieve by varying projection speed from one scene to the next? On the one hand he would be 'helping out' the construction of the narrative, while on the other he would be treating the audience to a display of the 'attractions' of the shot, asserting the autonomy of each shot even as he helped bind them together. As long as these two aesthetic systems, attraction and narration, co-existed - and they did for the duration of the storefront period - this kind of paradigmatic overlapping would inevitably be present, despite the narrative inscriptions of the 'production process,' throughout the constel- lation of early cinema practices: projection, exhibitor re-editing, musical accompaniment, modes of consumption, bonimenteur commentary, etc. Here the operator can be seen as a locus of cultural heterogeneity: any film could be transformed, through its projection, into something unique and specific to its milieu. We might thus conclude that theories of 'spectatorship' offer greater possibilities for analyzing the figure of the operator. Miriam Hansen spells out this school's starting point, which is the opposite of Gunning's: It is a mark of early cinema's specificity that its effects on the viewer were determined less by the film itself than by the particular act of exhibition, the situation of reception (Hansen 1991, 93-4). If the 'act of exhibition' in the storefront era - which we will argue is in fact a moment in the act of production - is to be accorded at least as much weight as production (we will shortly have to dampen Hansen's enthusiasm on this point) , then this period is an especially curious case (and it should be noted that Hansen's comments are specifically concerned with the 66</page><page sequence="28">The "Machine Operator" Model projection booth, U.S., c. 1916. This spacious and well-appointed booth, manned by two operators, was an enormous improvement over storefront boots of a few short years before. In F.H. Richardson (1916). storefront period, and not an earlier 'cinema of attractions'). Within this period Hansen identifies 'non-synchronous' layers of cultural organisa- tion,' wherein an emerging classical narrative system was consumed in a way that militated against the 'narrative absorption' Gunning postulates it was fostering: While the product could be multiplied like other mass-manufactured goods, the mode of exhibition predominant in the nickelodeon lagged behind this technological standard by continuing the representational practices of early cinema and a concomitant organisation of the relations of reception (Han- sen 1991,93). We have seen how this non-synchronic organisation existed not only between or within the fundamental operations of 'production' and 'exhi- bition' but also on the level of projection technology itself, of the opera- tor's 'instruments of labour.' Hand-cranked machines continued to be manufactured after motor drives became available; the 'intermittent dog' film transport mechanism persisted well after the development of the far superior Maltese Cross (Carroll 1964, 217). But here too it is impossible to enlist the operator in the cause, in this case of spectatorship. Projection practices are distinct from other aspects of 67</page><page sequence="29">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 Hansen's 'act of exhibition' precisely in the way they pertain as much to the realm of production as to exhibition. Using a piece of machinery that is a replica of the camera (initially they were the same apparatus) and which mechanically transports the film past a shutter and lens, the machine oper- ator, by varying the projection speed - a mirror of contemporary produc- tion technique and a universal practice with the contradictory effect of advancing the film's narrative while it evokes an 'aesthetic of attractions' - acts directly upon the material of the film itself to alter the way its images were inscribed on it. Not for all time, of course, but therein also lies the sig- nificance of this practice: production, at least this last stage of production, is diffused across the broad range of exhibition situations that exist, and is thus subject to permutation. In fact this intervention on the part of the operator allows us to collapse Gunning's distinction between 'production' and 'use' and to understand production as extending across a continuum that reaches right into the storefront cinema at the moment of consump- tion, in an act of intervention which both visibly inscribes the operator's labour onto the film - even as all the other labour that went into its pro- duction has been successfully effaced - and, by drawing attention to itself, implicates the spectators, individually and collectively, in this act of revi- sion. The machine operator thus stands as an emblem of the heterogene- ity and non-synchronism of cinema in the storefront era, a status which recalls his own ambiguous position in the industry: was he an industrial worker? Or a stage performer? Conditions of reception too, as Hansen remarks (Hansen 1991 , 91 ) , are produced, fabricated in the most industrial sense of the term. The projection booth itself is an example of this. She is thus correct to emphasise exhibition, not merely for the intrinsic reasons she identifies, however, but rather because during the storefront era it was a moment, the final and most democratic moment, in the process of production. To those who might object that the nature of this intervention in the film, the varying of projection speed, is a feeble claim for being considered part of the film production process, we can only reply: no more feeble than the narrative construction techniques of the day. For it was only late in this period, or indeed after this period, that the editing practices Griffith first began to codify in 1909 became common13, thus permitting the introduc- tion of feature films after 1913. Until then, and in fact well beyond, variable taking speeds and the pacing of actors were important narrative devices, and in both cases the operator could intervene to improve upon these still- experimental techniques. Machine operators argued simply that in prac- tice these techniques were imperfectly executed or neglected and that their intervention on the same plane was required to obtain the desired narra- tive development. This enlarged definition of the act of production has the added bene- fit, if the reader will allow us to eat our cake and have it too, of making it 68</page><page sequence="30">The "Machine Operator" possible to adopt Noël Burch's assertion, following Marx, that 'in the final analysis' production must be seen as the primary motor of change, and not exhibition (Burch 1990, 127). For with Hansen the pendulum really has swung too far, and exhibition has displaced production, which alone can provide us with a generative model; spectatorship on its own replaces such a model with an amorphous flux of ad hoc exhibition situations, wherein change comes from everywhere and from nowhere. Burch, on the other hand, never adequately accounted for exhibition and spectatorship. By postulating this role for the machine operator in the film produc- tion process, we are able to take up Burch's claim for the primacy of pro- duction by allowing it to assume the heterogeneity of storefront 'exhibi- tion' practices, which are of undeniable importance to an understanding of the period. Here our understanding of 'production' is not confined to the practices and personalities of the studio, compelling us to revise our view of the film as commodity during this period. In his discussion of alienation and commodity fetishism, Marx held that labour was effaced at each stage of the commodity's production and that the producers of that commodity did not enjoy a direct relationship with each other, but rather a social relationship mediated by it (Marx 1967, 72). The labour process, Marx wrote, disappears in the product .... Labour has incorporated itself with its subject: the former has materialised, the latter is transformed. That which in the labourer appeared as movement, now appears in the product as a fixed qual- ity without motion (Marx 1967, 180). At the risk of being facile, let's think of these comments, with their sug- gestive talk of the movement of labour and the materialisation of a com- modity deprived of motion, in terms of the films projected in the storefront cinema by the machine operator. It is true that the operator's labour is incorporated into and transformed by the product - otherwise the film would remain an inert mass of celluloid in a can and the operator simply performing a weird ritualistic dance in his booth. But this process takes place in a way not envisaged by Marx: the operator's movements materialise in a commodity which is anything but fixed and immobile. And the opera- tor, standing at his machine, cranking the film at a unique and varying speed, sees his labour inscribed onto the commodity (an industrial, mass- consumed commodity) every second of his working day. And the audience sees it too. However, this inscription is impermanent. Only with later cue sheets do we begin to get a sense of these performances (but by then they are no longer improvised by the operator but dictated by the studio through cue sheets or by the orchestra conductor in the pit) . Yet here again this imper- manence functions as a guarantee of the commodity's mutability and its 69</page><page sequence="31">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 43.1 capacity to be inscribed with different kinds of labour. If the film is an industrial commodity, it is also inflected at the final stage of its production by the individual operator, who renders its narrative malleable and perme- able. And if it is mass-consumed, this consumption takes place in an extraordinary variety of exhibition circumstances: what spectators are engaged in is not so much an absorption in or even a decoding of early manifestations of the IMR, as a moment in the production process itself. Here industrial labour is visibly and audibly inscribed onto the commodity before their eyes, and the film's narrative completed at the moment of con- sumption in an act of interpretive collaboration between machine operator and spectator. The storefront cinema era and the figure of the machine operator are permeated with the sorts of contradictions and systemic overlapping inher- ent to a period of transformation: the operator's instrument of labour affords him a paradoxical kind of non-alienated labour even as it exhausts him and chains him to his machine; an aesthetic of attractions is prolonged and borrowed from in the construction of a new aesthetic of narration; the spectator's role is fundamental, not just because of the variety of exhibition circumstances but because the operator's intervention makes visible the construction of narrative and creates an interpretive relationship between operator and spectator. A history of narrative that neglects the operator is a history of capital, of an industry that sought to efface labour from its com- modities. And the development of the IMR was not merely a 'narrative' (studio-bound) process but a re-organisation of the forces of production and their relationship to the commodity and to the consumer. To the operator's question, many pages back, 'What is the purpose of the booth?', we can now answer: it was the first step in effacing the presence of the operator in the hall and his visibility in the film itself, an essential pre- condition to the establishment of the IMR, which presents itself as natural and thus unalterable to an audience absorbed in its narrative and undis- tracted by signs of its production. Deprived of a seat at the table alongside capital, refused recognition for his contribution, shut up in his booth - ostensibly to prevent fires but in fact to get him out of the way, in more ways than one - the machine operator soldiered on regardless, for a while per- forming an invaluable task on the Institution's behalf. Eventually, however, this task was no longer required: 'complete and coherent films, unified commodities' came to be produced, and the 'act of exhibition' to present no interference with their intended consumption. Capital proceeded to write film history without the operator, just as it had denied him recogni- tion in his own day. Fortunately, he left behind some written traces of his passage, which formed the basis of this article. Today he, and she, are com- pletely invisible, and the screen bears no trace of their labour. With digital feeds from remote sources soon to be upon us, they may yet be eliminated entirely. Then the gods, deprived of their sole emissary, will only be able to 70</page><page sequence="32">71 The "Machine Operator" look down helplessly upon the follies of humanity.

For British legislation, see note 5. 3 The author, Willis Elliott Reynolds, continues his inventory of health hazards in the booth and the problems they cause, such as excessive heat, heart failure, anaemia, etc. As late as 1939 in France, when projectionists' working condi- tions and equipment had improved immeasurably, a doctoral thesis in medi- cine was published detailing the adverse health effects of projecting. These included: skin diseases (exposure to ultraviolet and infra-red light and metal- lic dust); respiratory problems (inhalation of fumes, dust and smoke); impaired vision (radiation, fumes); nervous disorders (excessive noise); toxic poisoning (inhalation of intense fumes, metallic particles and dust, and sul- phuric acid) ; and even sexual impotence (X-rays emanating from the electric arc). The author notes that under the French law of 1919 covering workplace safety, still in effect at the time of writing, projectionists were not recognised as potentially suffering from illnesses which could be indemnified, since an acci- dent was required to initiate a claim. See Guimpel-Levitzky 1939, passim. 4 In the U.S., one commentator reported a 100% increase in one year, between 1908 and 1909, to 10,000 cinemas {Film Index 20 February 1909). Growth rates were less spectacular in France and the U.K., but significant none the less.

There are as many rhythms as there are films. Paderewski doesn't give the same rendition of a piece as a pianola. Now, while we await the Paderewskis of projection, couldn't we at least have 'player pianos' who won't betray the rhythm of the film with their own false rhythm'? Louis Delluc, 'La Cadence,' 1920 (Delluc 1985, 58). In his translation of this key article, Richard Abel misunderstands the text and has Delluc speaking of musical accompanists and not projectionists. See Abel 1988, 228-29. 8 See for example a discussion of this phenomenon in the 1920s in Koszarski 1990, 56-60; Brownlow 1990, 282-90; and Salt 1992, 158. At one point the Soci- ety of Motion Picture Engineers even discussed a standard taking speed of 60 feet per minute and a projection speed of 80 feet. See for example Rowland 1927, 77. For a detailed case study of this phenomenon and its cultural ramifi- cations outside the metropolis, see Tsivian 1998, 49-65. 9 Richardson 1916, 150. Note that Richardson himself rejected this practice and insisted that overspeeding must only be used judiciously, for narrative effect, and not to lend 'snap' to the overall picture, a notion already in circulation. 10 Richardson 1923, 214. Richardson cautions that he had this attribution second- hand and that he was not able to confirm it. This didn't prevent Kevin Brown- low, apparently with Richardson as his source, from retailing it without qualifi- cation (Brownlow 1990, 288). 11 This is also the view of Ernest Coustet (Coustet n.d., 77-8); André Dubet (Dubet 1924, 26); and the Modem Bioscope Operator (1910, 110 and 1911, 128). There were a few exceptions to this position, with some authors insisting on the need to maintain a strict equivalence of taking and projecting speeds, even while acknowledging, in some cases, that taking speeds could vary. These include Leopold Löbel (Löbel 1912, 149-50), Robert Filmos (Filmos 1921, 33), and Frederick A. Talbot (Talbot 1912, 102). Talbot makes the point that even if one is of the opinion that projection speed must match the taking speed, an astute operator is needed to perceive and react to the widespread variations in taking speed. 12 The only technical literature I have been able to locate on early projection sys- tems is Malkames 1967, 97-104, in which the author fails even to mention the distinction between hand- and motor-driven machines. 1 3 Kristin Thompson dates the first formulation of a 'classical' style to 1909-1 1 and its 'basic completion' to 1917 (Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger 1985, 157), while Noël Burch seems to locate the first clear expression of the IMR to 1914 and comments that 'the cinema was never again to change so profoundly as it did between 1905 and 1914' (Burch 1990, 136). Gunning, incidentally, acknowl- edges that Griffith's innovations were still isolated experiments as late as 1909 and that even in Griffith's films parallel editing, which Gunning says 'rules' the 72</page><page sequence="34">The "Machine Operator" narrator system, 'became an important device' only around 1912 (Gunning 1991,189).
