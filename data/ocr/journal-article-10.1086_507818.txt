      <p>The one‐word title of this collection of anthropological essays announces a comprehensive, if not definitive, exploration of the place of “things” among humans. And <italic>Materiality</italic> provides indeed a rich and varied range of analyses of matter reaching from Egyptian pyramids and African Christian healing to futures markets and computer software. The book moves at the forefront of debates in several respects. Being rooted in anthropology, the home discipline of most of the contributors, it draws significantly on recent work in the sociology of scientific knowledge, but reaches out to philosophy and religion as well. In terms of subject “matter,” its ambition to widen our sense of the material leads to interest into the objectness of artworks, derivatives, screens, or the honey used in healing practices.</p>
      <p>Throughout the chapters, the analyses are of high quality. The authors know their cases and present them well. At the same time, they connect to the broader issues the volume intends to raise and to the rising literature on “materiality”: from Bruno Latour’s actor‐network approach to Marilyn Strathern’s thoughts about agency and objectification to the late Alfred Gell’s theory of anthropomorphism, not all of which will have been standard reference for the specialist authors. The hand of the editor may be visible here; the result is a common thread that is stronger than one may have expected in a volume containing under a very general title analyses of very different topics.</p>
      <p>If there is a problem, it is thus not the lack of coherence common to many edited volumes; it rather concerns the message that the overall volume intends to convey. For David Miller, the editor, who has worked on material culture for 20 years and under a great variety of aspects, this book seems to bring together strands of recent theoretical work toward a “second theory of materiality,” which “will be the most encompassing and will situate material culture within a larger conceptualization of culture” (p. 4). To avoid being misunderstood, I broadly agree with the program set out in the introduction and the overall volume, and I object to it neither from the point of view of an antiquated “first‐theory” materialism nor from the perspective of a sociologism that forgets about things in the world. Rather, I would like to examine carefully what innovation the new approach precisely offers. Two claims are crucial in this respect.</p>
      <p>First, the announced second theory of materiality is proposed in strong opposition to the overemphasis—even “reification” (p. 36), an odd term in the current context—of “the social” in earlier analyses of things, in particular in social anthropology. True, it has sometimes been an obsession of social scientists to see “the social” at work everywhere. But there is a difference between what may rightly be called the objectification of “society” in the Durkheimian strand of sociology, as forcefully criticized by Bruno Latour, and the emphasis on the “social,” a term that after all does not signify anything else than that which connects human beings. For some of the impressive analyses one may indeed ask whether they do anything else than offer a “social analysis of material things” (Webb Keane; p. 182), and whether that is not also precisely what we should expect them to do. A “postsocial theory” (Nigel Thrift, quoting Karin Knorr Cetina; p. 234), if it can exist, would after all no longer be social theory. The editor’s critical discussion of “the tyranny of the subject” in social anthropology and sociology contains many interesting observations, but it fails to specify what exactly the “more than” (p. 40) is that the second theory of materiality offers.</p>
      <p>The second target of the volume is located outside of the social sciences narrowly understood, namely in philosophy and religion. It is rightly pointed out that the Western philosophical tradition, including its residues in the modern sciences, shares with many religions throughout history the fundamental distinction between the material and the immaterial, usually locating the latter at a higher plane. Whether in terms of a dualism between essence and appearance, between noumena and phenomena, or between the sacred and the profane, some such distinction is often foundational for knowledge‐seeking and religious practices. However, so the editor and several of the contributors to this volume maintain, such distinction can never be upheld, because every reference to the “immaterial” needs to operate through the “material,” such as the healing honey of a Zimbabwean Christian church. Again, the point is well taken, and the critical angle appreciated. But the question is, where do we stand after such assertion? If everything is always material, at least in some way, what do we say when we analyze materiality? The editor, aware of the issue, concludes on the “nuances, relativism, and plural nature of both materiality and immateriality” (p. 41)—and this is indeed what the volume successfully explores. Starting from the richness of the analyses and the sophistication of the conceptual reflections, however, more work would need to be done to indeed demonstrate the “cultural logics” (p. 42) at play when we deal with things.</p>
