<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES' MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE IN 1950, as a gift from the Library of Con- gress and from the National Museum of Canada, the F. W. Waugh manuscript collection of Iro- quois folktales was added to the American Philo- sophical Society's now extensive collection of Iro- quoian materials. At the time that he deposited this manuscript at the Society's Library in Phila- delphia, Dr. W. N. Fenton also presented the Li- brary with the W. N. B. Hewitt folktale manu- script from the Iroquois as an additional gift from the Bureau of American Ethnology. Frederick Wilkerson Waugh was born at Lang- ford, a hamlet close to the Grand River and only a few miles from the Six Nations Iroquois Reserve near Brantford, Ontario, on April 14, 1872. From 1912 until his death in 1924 he was a member of the staff of the National Museum of Canada at Ot- tawa, with the title of Preparator in Ethnology. During his years with the Museum, Mr. Waugh conducted field researches among the Ojibwas of Northern Ontario, the Naskapis in Quebec, the Eskimos on the Labrador coast, and the Monta- gnais Indians of the lower St. Lawrence River. His chief and lasting interest, however, was the Six Nations Iroquois peoples. His publication, in 1916, of "Iroquois Foods and Food Prepara- tion,'1 2made a considerable contribution to our knowledge of the material culture of the Iroquois. The folktale manuscript consists of 157 differ- ent items of fiction and folklore, over 700 pages, from the Iroquois Indians. Mr. Waugh typed and made notes on the stories and intended publishing the collection. The Report of the Department of Mines for the year ending March 31, 1921, reads: F. W. Waugh continued work on his monograph dealing with the folklore of the Iroquois. This volume will consist of a large series of folk-tales from the various tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy and of a discussion of such beliefs and practices as come under the general rubric of "Folk-lore." Another of his major interests among the Iro- quois was in medical practices. Among his papers at the National Museum are copious notes on the magical and other beliefs and procedures connected with disease, illness, and curing, and on the botani- cal identification of plants used in the Iroquois pharmacopoeia. No doubt he contemplated fur- ther research and eventual publication of a work on Iroquois medicine. Waugh's death is a mystery. The Report of the Department of Mines, year ending March 31, 1925, reads: F. W. Waugh spent the summer season on ethno- logical research among the Montagnais Indians at Seven Islands, Quebec. A great deal of material was obtained on the technological aspects of their culture. On his way back to Ottawa from the field, Mr. Waugh disappeared and no trace has been dis- covered of him since the latter part of September, 1924. The ethnological notes, photographs, and specimens obtained by him, however, had been for- warded to Ottawa shortly before and are now in the hands of the Museum. Waugh published very little. In the Summary Report of the Geological Survey for 1912, he has four pages (476-480) "On work on material cul- ture of the Iroquois." He was interested in the folklore of the White Canadian pioneers, and his "Canadian Folklore from Ontario" appeared in the Journal of American Folklore in 1918 (31 :4-83). In 1919 he published a short article in the Cana- dian Field-Naturalist (33 :23-33) on "Canadian Aboriginal Canoes." His folktale collection should be published. It is my hope that the following description of the manuscript will make the need for publication ap- parent. Waugh visited the Six Nations Reserve every summer between 1911 and 1918, with the excep- tion of 1917. Most of the tales are dated 1915 or 1918, but a few of them bear dates of 1912, 1914, and 1916. At Grand River he wrote the stories out in longhand, in English. On his return to Ot- tawa he had them typed and, after corrections, he retyped and made notes on them. These annota- tions consist of a page attached to each story on which are listed: title, theme, incidents, personages and customs, beliefs, etc. It is not known whether the titles were given the stories by Waugh or by 1 Research was carried out with the aid of a grant from the Phillips Library Fund of the American Philosophical Society. 2 Anthropological Series (Canada Department of Mines, Geological Survey, Ottawa), Memoir 86, No. 12, 1916.

Under "theme" he outlines brieflv the main episodes of the plot. The "incidents" listed are identified by means of catch-words for motifs, and a list of these has been found among the Waugh papers in the National Museum. The frequency of occurrence of these motifs could be computed and the catch-words explained when the tales are published. The stories were written in English and told by informants who spoke both English and one of the Iroquoian languages. Waugh corrected glaring grammatical errors and used circumlocutions, eu- phemisms, or Latin phrases for expressions that he thought might shock the reader. However, his revisions were not extensive and the stories retain a flavor of the local "reservation" English, simple in vocabulary, colloquial, and countrified. The style of the narratives Will find illustration in the quotations which appear in this paper. Twenty-three individuals, twenty-one men, and two women, contributed the stories, and all of the Six Nations are represented. Two informants, both Cayuga men, told more than twenty stories each. Nine informants are credited with single items. The remainder contributed between two and sixteen stories apiece. The bulk of the collec- tion is from Cayuga informants, over four hundred pages. Onondagas made the second largest con- tribution, forty-three stories, about one hundred pages. There are only a few tales from each of the other tribal groups: Mohawk, six; Oneida, four; Seneca, three; Tuscarora, eight. All of the stories are from the Six Nations Reserve except the following: two from Oneidas at Oneidatown; one from an Onondaga from Onondaga Castle; one from a Seneca at Cattaraugus, and one from a Tonawanda Seneca. The index which follows shows the exact con- tents of the collection. Though prepared specifi- cally for reference in this paper, it could be used by anyone who wished to consult the manuscript at the Societv's Library in Philadelphia. INDEX OF WAUGH MS.

FICTION The great bulk of the collection, over five hun- dred pages, belongs in the category of fiction. The tales are novelistic and they deal with the real world as now constituted and as inhabited by the present animals and the present, but not European- ized, Iroquois. They abound in magic; all types and kinds of magic effects, practiced by all sorts of animate and inanimate creations. Birds and animals behave like men; and men can transform themselves into birds or animals, or get into the skin of a deer or a mouse. Dolls talk, canoes fly, and stars may be substituted for eyes. Monsters of horrendous aspect, such as Flying Heads or Giant Bears, wizards, witches, cannibals, and giants, threaten, pursue, compete with, and test the heroes. The most recurrent theme is the op- position of the magic power of a hero to the magic power of some wizard or witch, and the hero is often called "a wizard" for he is the possessor of magic power, and because his magic is superior to that of his opponents he is able to overcome them. The fiction consists of a long series of contest stories, which are the most detailed tales in the collection, a considerable number of tales which deal primarily with man's magical relationships with various animals, tales which belong to the trickster series, and twenty stories which are of European derivation. I. HERO-CONTEST TALES A contest between the hero and various op- ponents is the major theme of thirty-eight tales. Though their plots differ widely, and they have been separated into nine divisions, the testing of the magic powers of the hero is the predominant motif in all of them. One of the most common themes (1-7) is that which tells how a boy hero overcomes witches, wizards, or cannibal giants and rescues his dead relatives by resuscitating them. This little boy hero is a common character in the fiction. He is called Dreadnaught in many of the titles by Waugh, and named Uksedaiiha in many of the tales. He is the typical undersized and under- privileged Hans or Jack of European folk tra- dition. In these stories he is generally the sole survivor of a group of brothers and he lives alone with an elderly relative, either an old uncle or a grandmother. He is confined to the house be- cause of fear of the evil characters which did away with his siblings. In some of the stories it is told how adept the little fellow is with bow and arrow, shooting bugs or a raccoon's or rabbit's foot hung up for a target inside the house. His guardian has forbidden the boy to go in a certain direction (usually west or north), but he determines to go there. When he informs his guardian that he is afraid of nothing and that he is going to start out in the forbidden direction, he is usually provided with food, advice, and magic clothing or equipment. In some stories the boy leaves a life-token with his relative, which will keep him informed as to his progress. Wizards, more often than witches, are encountered by the boy, and often, with magical foreknowledge, they expect him. Usually these wizards meet the boy with a challenge to play a game or engage in a contest upon which heads must be wagered. Among the tests are foot-races, the bowl gambling game, lacrosse, magical hiding, staying awake all night, wrestling, or some other type of combat. The boy, by his own magic, or with magic help from others, wins. When they are defeated, the wizards are hard to destroy. Sometimes after the hero has cut off his head, his other limbs must be hacked off and kept away from the rest of the remains for they have the power to return to the body and reunite with it. Sometimes the hero burns the wizard, and then his head may explode "like a cannon" or burst and an owl comes forth from it. Sometimes the wizard has a separable "life" or "soul" which the hero must find and destroy. Generally, the hero finds a collection of bones near the wizard's lodge. These he assembles, and, finding a large tree nearby, usually a hickory, he pushes it over, shouting, "Get up or the tree will fall on you !" This resuscitates the bones, which are clothed with flesh and spring up, though some of the men are halt and lame, for some of the bones have not been arranged in good order. This group includes the boy's lost brothers and uncles, and these, often accompanied by other non-relatives, he</page><page sequence="6">616 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AMER. I&gt;fIL. SOC. brings home with him, sometimes by means of magic transportation, to a village magically con- structed for them. The uncle or grandmother who has been left at home generally grieves for the boy for he is away longer than was expected. The fox or other animals, who pretend to be the missing boy, pester and fool him. So, when the hero does re- turn he is not admitted until he identifies himself by letting his uncle examine his hand, thrust through the door. Then the uncle lets him in and the family is happily reunited. "Boy Wizard Rescues Relatives" follows the above plot outline and in addition contains the common motif of the boy friend of the same age as the hero. When the boy goes out to seek his adventures he finds a boy of his own age and size. They make friends and the hero often stays with his friend for some time. This friend usuallv lives in poverty, alone with his grandmother. The hero often aids his friend in hunting, in overcoming some witch or wizard who threatens him, or he may enlist the friend as an assistant in his own adventures. In this story he frees his friend from a witch by defeating her in a game of lacrosse. A bird is his totem or guardian and he is able to transform himself into this bird and carry the ball into the goal. His bird assists him in the seconcl cointest also, a bowl gambling game, for the bird catches the peach-stones when thrown into the air and puts them down in the bowl to make the hero wN-in. After the ganme the hero kills the witch, leaves his friend. and goes off on other adventures alone. The "Adventures of Dreadnaught" conforms to the pattern and in addition has the following motif. This is the incident in which the hero is marooned upon an island. In this story the boy friend of the hero owns coats made of crows' feathers which give the power to fly. The friend maroons the hero, taking away the crow coat. Then a skull advises the hero how to escape the fate planned for him, and the marooner, when he returns in order to gloat upon his victim's bones, is in ttirn marooned. This hero possesses the power of magic weeping and in a wrestling contest with a cannibal, who has eaten his brothers, he weeps such vast quantities of tears that he drowns his enemy. Another example of this tale-type, "Dread- naught Rescues Relatives," is an incomplete ver- sion and adds no new motifs. Four stories (4-7) are variants of this theme. In each of them a girl is involved and she becomes the hero's wife, or, if this is not stated explicitly, it is implied, for the hero takes the girl hom-e with him at the end of the tale. Usually the girt is an unwilling assistant to one of the hero's enemies, a cannibal, witch, or wizard, and she, though she may lure him into the cannibal's house, is on the hero's side ancl mnay assist him in defeating his enemy. The girl is a minor clharacter. and it Nwould be stretching the meaning of the word to call the stories "romiantic." In "Dreadnaught Rescues Friends" the girl goes home with the hero simply because she has lived with the cannibal so long that she has forgotten the way to her owvn home. In "Dreadnaught Defeats a Witch" the women play a mnore active role. Two sisters, who are the slaves of their grandmother witch, kidnap the little boy hero in their flying canoe when he goes in the forbidden direction. The witch imiiposes tests on the hero. He fulfils the first commillland. The second is more difficult and he needls and re- ceives magic help from his grandmother at home. The girls aid him with information which helps him to kill the witch. The bov marries the younger girl, and they fly back to his ol0l homlle in the canoe. 'Dreadnaught Rescues Relatives" begins with five brothers alive, instead of a sole survivor, and relates how the older brothers in tturn lose their lives to a cannibal wizard. They are lured to his house by a young girl. When Uksedaiiha follows his brothers he too meets the girl and is enticed into the cannibal's house. The wizard tries to sing the hero to sleep. The hero has two stars for eyes and a frog for a voice. So he fools the old man into thinking him awake. He collects the wager, cutting off the wizard's head. But the girl warns him that the wizard is not Yet destroved. Animuals are called to comle and eat the corpse. and a separable "life"-the old man's liver which lhangs under a loon's wing in his bed-is destroyed. Quite different incidents occur in "Boy Hero Humiliates Detractors." The little boy hero is not alone, he is simply the yroungest, a kind of mlale Cinderella, "bare-footed and ragged, with his feet in the ashes." A girl lures him to her home where he has to play a game of peach-stone bowl gambling with her grandmother. His own grandmiiother gives him the magic assistance of a bird which helps him beat the witch. He marries the girl, and on their wedding night scabs from sores on the boy's body magically turn into wampum which his wife treasures. The boy goes out hunting with his wife and her family. but he is so small that he</page><page sequence="7">V'OL. 97, NO. 5, 1953] WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 617 gets nothing but flowers and the men scoff at him. However, he returns home for some magic flints with w hich he is able to kill many animals and so he wins respect for his magic power. On their return from the hunting expedition he brings a great quantity of meat to his grandmother who makes him tall and handsome by her magic. MIany elements in this tale differ from the general tone of the collection and the cause of this difference may lie in the fact that it is one of the few tales recorded from a Mohawk informant. Five other tales (8-12) concern heroes who have various adventures and overcome monsters and wizards, but they do not follow the pattern described in any great detail, though certain nmotifs do reoccur. In "Dreadnaught Conquers a Giant Cannibal" a young man, rather than a little boy, is the hero. He goes in the forbidden direc- tion only after the death of his aged relative. He finds a young woman who is suffering from a giant who comles periodically and cuts pieces of flesh froml her body. Our hero waits for the giant and when he appears they engage in a fight which lasts a year and takes them all around the world and back to their starting point. By that time they have both been reduced to bugs, one with a yel- low mouth and the other with a red mouth. As previously directed by the hero, the girl restores him by pouring sunflower oil on the red-mouthed bug. The hero, a young man again, steps on the bug which is all that is left of the giant. Finally, he resuscitates all of the giant's victims by the falling tree trick. Another round-the-world fight occurs in "The Bloodsucker Bride and Other Adventures." This hero is a very little boy who is kept in the house by his uncle. He finds a way out, however, and meets a boy of his own age with whom he be- comes friends. Together they kill the bloodsucker- bride of the hero's uncle. The two friends quarrel and finally decide to fight it out. This takes the form of a round-the-world combat. The first boy kills the second just as they are returning to their starting place. He returns to his uncle, but after a few days leaves again and meets a new friend. These two go off on adventures together. "Hastaha Defeats His Uncles" is a long, epi- sodic story. Many contests, with a whole series of wizards occur, but no relatives are rescued. After defeating all of the wizards, the hero kills two Flying Heads. In the last part of this tale the hero behaves like a trickster, deceiving the wolf and the partridge-woman in a series of practical jokes. Initial disaster comes to the hero in "Adventures of Uniudt" when he starts out in the forbidden direction. However, his uncle's magic helps him overcome this difficulty and he sets out again, well- equipped by his uncle with magic aids. He over- comes a wizard in a hiding contest and resuscitates relatives, then he meets another wizard who chal- lenges him to a foot-race. After defeating him, he proceeds in a flying canoe. He has some humor- ous adventures with cannibals. He kills them, and goes on, completing a trip around the world and finally returning to his uncle. Only one contest, a foot-race, is involved in "A Braggart Challenged." A young man, who is a good runner, boasts of his ability. A supernatural, giant bear, overhearing his boast, challenges him to a foot-race which the boy finally wins after many difficulties. The story points a moral fre- quently found in this fiction, that boasting is a bad thing because it leads to a test of one's powers. The main theme of five stories (13-17) is the rescue by a little boy hero of prisoners from torture by witches. In four of the five, this rescue is accomplished by means of counter-torture which the boy inflicts upon the witches through a peculiar type of sympathetic magic-the boy has obtained moccasins made from the genitals of two witches and he causes pain to the witches by putting these moccasins in the fire. The prisoner whom the little boy rescues is a relative in four of the five stories, usually an elder brother. In all of the stories, the prisoner produces wampum when he is tortured, his tears changing into wampum as they fall. The first three stories are quite similar and might be considered versions of the same tale. Here is the outline of the plot. A little boy hero is the sole survivor of a group of brothers and lives with an aged relative. He discovers his elder brother, hidden in the house and he gets him up to dance and drum with him. Young girls, witches, appear in a flying canoe and kidnap the elder brother. The boy hero follows magically and demands moccasins made of the skin of the witches' genitals, which they give him. In the witches' land, the little boy discovers a friend of his own age and he helps him in various ways. The two boys go to the longhouse where the brother is being tortured, each boy wearing one of the peculiar moccasins. When the witches tor- ture the prisoners the boys stick their moccasined feet into the fire. This causes such pain to the torturers that they must stop. Then small animals assist the boys in cutting down the prisoner. The</page><page sequence="8">618 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. witches are put to sleep by song or magic spell, their house is turned to rock, and house and in- mates are burned. In "Dreadnaught Rescues Relatives" the boy hero is called Uksedaiiha and he lives alone with his grandmother. His uncle is the one concealed and, after his discovery by the hero, stolen by the witches. In addition to rescuing the prisoner, the boy rescues others, "all his uncles," by the falling- tree resuscitation method. "Uksedaiiha and the Kidnapped Brother" con- tains more detail about the other little boy, friend to the hero. Uksedaiiha provides mleat for the strange boy and his grandmother and frees them from a witch who has been taking all of their meat. After he has freed his brother from the torturing witches and brought hiim home, he revisits his friend, but finds he has become a cannibal. The two engage in a long struggle which takes them around the world and reduces them both to skulls. But a woman with sunflower oil, prepared ac- cording to the hero's previous directions, is able to restore the hero who smashes the opposing skull into a tree where it becomes a protuberance suich as those used by the Iroquois in making war-clubs. "A Witch and Torturers Outwitted" omits all of the first episodes of the tale and starts with the two boy friends and how one helps the other by freeing himl and his grandmother from a witch who steals their food. This is effected by the hero's magic, for he can miake the pot close on the hand of the witch when she grasps the meat in the pot. In this case the boys obtain the genital moc- casins from the witches in return for wampum. The prisoners are not relatives of the rescuer in this tale. The torturing goes on for many nights, the boys attending the meetings, but fearful of discovery, for when they put their moccasined feet in the fire and make the witches scream with pain the leader stops the imeeting and tries smoke- divining-the smoke is supposed to move toward the person who is causing the trouble. The boys try various ways of dodging the smoke, running around and blowing much smoke about themselves. This storv is different from the others in that ex- cept for burning the peculiar moccasins the boys do nothing to destroy the torturers, and they es- cape with the prisoners whomi they have set free without the aid of animals. As the title implies, "AN Visit to the Sky and Other Adventures" concerns an other-world journey. Two orphans set otut in search of their deacl parents. They reach the sky world by means of a miraculous pine tree which extends to a hole in the sky. In the sky world they do find their parents, but it is a disappointment to them, for they are not spoken to and they find that their father is suffering from burns inflicted upon him as pun- ishment for quarreling with his wife upon earth. They get a cold reception on all sides. Witches try to poison them, but they sham eating and escape. They are anxious to return to earth. A super- natural man, who has acted as their guide, helps them iback to earth. Magic feathers on their heads help them to descend. He promises to assist themii in the future. This description of the other-world shows the unmistakable influence of the Handsome Lake religion. On earth again, the boy finds a friend and again performs the closing pot trick to keep away a witch who steals food. The supernatural helper makes this possilble. Near them the torture of a prisoner to extract wampum-tears is going on and they visit the longhouse and watch the perform- ance. The hero wants to stop the torture and asks his supernatural friend for aid. This-he provides. giving the boy the genital-moccasins he asks for. At the lodge the next night the boys make the torturers stop by torturing them through the moc- casins thrust into the fire. The boys, with the aid of their heavenly guide, make the inmates of the lodge fall into a magic sleep. They free the prisolner, wVIo in this case is not a relative, and magically burn the lodge with meteors and convert it into solid rock. The boy and his sister, trans- ported by a magic crow, return to their old home. In "Boy Hero Rescuies Brother" the little boy lives alone with his grandmother. He discovers a lidden brother and gets him to come out and play with himii, but a witch arrives and takes him awav. The hero starts out in pursuit and meets a boy of his owil age with whom he makes friends. The two boys go to the lodge where the torturing takes place, anfd the first night they simply watch the proceedings. On the second night they get their guardian animals to help them in the rescue. A flying squirrel, the totem animiial of one of the b)ovs, poisons the food that the torturer is eating an(c so makes her stop. A bat, the other's magic aid1, paralyses the people, and the boy causes a magic sleep to descend upon the house. Then they free the prisoner and the little bov takes his brother home. Two stories (18, 19) tell how a brother rescues his sister from a wizard. Though the two plots are quite different, each has this fundamental theme of brother assisting sister in an escape from wizards who have sexual designs upon her. Certain minor</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 1953] WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 619 motifs are common to both: deception is effected by wearing clothing of the other sex; a wooden doll, magically constructed to look like a woman, delays the wizard by catching and holding him in its cleft; and various uncles assist the couple in their flight. Two distinct episodes are involved in "The Sister's Rescue." The first concerns the brother's double. The sister thinks that her brother is mak- ing -improper advances toward her, but he assures her that this in his double. Both are red-headed, but the brother is distinguishable because of his larger teeth. Finally, the two engage in a round- the-world struggle. They fight until both are merely bloody skulls. But the sister, as previously instructed by her brother, is able to restore the brother by an application of sunflower oil, where- upon he destroys the evil double. In the second episode, the sister becomes in- volved with a wizard when she breaks a tabu against swimming. When the wizard spends the night with the brother and sister, the brother con- fuses him by wearing his sister's clothes and by a complicated manoeuvering of sleeping places. An attempt to discover the true sex of the brother and sister by means of a urinating contest proposed by the wizard, is thwarted by the brother's trick of using an apparatus made from a deer's bladder, which both brother and sister use to trick the wizard. Then the siblings flee and on their way beg aid of four helpful old men, called "uncles"; first is the sleeper, who prepares a wooden doll which detains the pursuer when he embraces it, second is the net-maker who detains him in the meshes of his nets, third is the maker of corn-husk faces who fights with him but is beaten, and fourth is the war-dancer who succeeds in killing him. "The Kidnapped Baby" begins with the girl as a baby, stolen from her parents by an evil man who wants to bring her up to be his wife. He dresses like a woman and masquerades as her mother. The girl has a little brother at home, and as he grows up he keeps hearing from his sister by magic and making plans to rescue her. He finds his sister while the wizard is out hunting and directs her how to discover the true sex of her kidnapper. Later he prepares a wooden doll to leave in her stead, and the brother and sister flee from the wizard. The start is facilitated by a magic arrow transport of the sister, and the brother's turning into a hare and confusing the tracks around the wizard's house. Men who live along the route agree to help the youngsters. The wizard is de- tained first by the wooden doll, who talks and pretends to be ill, and finally dies. As the wizard embraces it he is caught by its closing upon him. The net-maker and the arrow-maker slow down his pursuit, and the war-dancer finally kills him. Stories similar to "The Nephew Who Went for Hazelnuts" are found in many of the collections of Iroquois folktales.3 This one is brief and un- elaborated. A boy spies on his uncle and discovers that he has a secret, magic food supply. In the uncle's absence, the boy copies his uncle's magical procedures and uses up the nut food. When the uncle returns he tells the boy that he has caused his death, for this food was the only thing he could eat and it is impossible to obtain more of it. The youth, afraid of nothing, demands directions for getting the nuts and sets out. He has a wolf as a guardian animal, and, by transforming himself into a wolf, he succeeds in fooling the two gigantic buffaloes who guard the hazelnut tree. He steals a few hazelnuts and returns home with them. In other versions of this story the hero must overcome many monsters, wizards, and witches to obtain the nuts, which are often chestnuts instead of hazelnuts. Other versions often have the hero distribute the nuts to mankind when he has secured them, and such stories seem related to culture- hero tales which relate how a type of food, or necessity such as fire, is obtained and given to man. Tests imposed on a young man by his bride's mother or grandmother are of chief importance in the plots of four stories (21-24). In every case the old woman is a witch who seeks to destroy the young husband. The first three stories are ver- sions of the same complicated theme. Though they differ in many details, the main outline which they all share consists of the following essentials. A secluded young man, who lives alone with his uncle, is summoned by girls, who usually arrive in a flying canoe made of wampum. The hero is told that he must follow these girls and marry the youngest of them. After some magical prepara- tions in which he is aided by his uncle, the young man starts out as leader of a group of suitors who also have been summoned to follow the sisters to their own country. During the trip the girls try to to destroy the suitors by various hostile tricks, and the young men behave in a hostile way toward the girls, tramping out their fires at night, refusing to share food with them, etc. Some of the suitors 3Parker, Arthur, Seneca Myths and Folk Tales, 128 ff., Buffalo, Buffalo Hist. Soc., 1923.</page><page sequence="10">620 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. die on the journey. When the remainder arrives at the girls' home, the witch tries to freeze the suitors by enclosing them in a house of ice. By magic the boys withstand this treatment and the mother then allows them to marry the girls. On their wedding night, the witch, feigning sleep, jumps into the fire; and she states, when aroused by the chief suitor, that she has dreamed that cer- tain animals must be killed. This dream demand is fulfilled by the son-in-law. The animals which he kills are identified bw the witch as her relatives and helpers, or friends. Usually this dream de- mand is repeated three times and after the ful- filnment of the final test the hero kills the witch and takes the girls home with him. "Suitors Overcome a Witch and Obtain Wives" follows this pattern and contains in addition some other details worth notice. The hero possesses magical deer-horns which grow under his arms and which he removes and uses to help him in climbing a slippery tree which is a prerequisite to the fulfilment of one of the dreamii-demands. At the beginning of this story the uncle attempts to persuade the girls to sumlmion him instead of his nephew, but when they ilnsist on the younger man, he equips himii with miiany miiagic aids, and also helps himil by' miagic at a distance during the tests. At the eild( of the story the uncle is rewarded by the nephew with the gift of two girls for wives. There are four girls and four suitors in this tale, but two of the suitors are killed on the journey. The two surviving suitors bring all of the girls home and present the uncle with the two extra girls. This story is unique in that the girls themselves stig- gest the destruction of their mother, and tell the hero how to find her "life," a small object tied under the wing of a loon hidden under her bed. The title of "The Seven Sisters and Their Suitors" might arouse a suspicion of influence from European tales, as seven is a rare number to occur in an aboriginal story. Moreover, the in- formant forgot some of the story and leaves the plot at loose ends. The story proceeds along the pattern outlined above until the fulfilment of the first dream-demand. After that the witch im- poses a test which results in the flaying of the hero. He returns to her house without his skin and finds it hanging there. By magic he causes the skin to return to him and he destroys the witch's house, but what happens to the girls or to their mother is left in doubt. The third version, "A Witchcraft Contest" con- tains a great variety of magical objects and magical procedures. There is magic transportation, magi- cal hunting, magic in the compulsion of wishes and of names. For example, the hero is given minia- ture objects by his uncle which enable him to have the object full size at any time he needs it. He has a little canoe which he can make full-sized and use whenever necessary; he carries one piece of straw which can be converted into a large pile; and he has a tiny pot which becomes full-sized, etc. When he is in a hurry he reduces the size of his companions, puts them inside an oak gall and blows them on ahead. This tale is the only one in which, after the hero has fulfilled three dream-demands for the mother- in-law, he plays a similar trick upon her. He dreams that she must gather a basketful of wild beans before noon. She and her daughters are unable to accomplish this, so he destroys the mother but takes the daughters home with him, telling his companions, "Don't hurt your wives."^ 'Hunter's Adventures with a Cannibal and a Witch" does not belong to the same tale-type, but it, too, includes the dream-demands. In this story one of four brothers becomes a cannibal. He pursues his brothers and kills two of them, but one escapes with the help of a big turtle who takes him across the lake but drow7ns the cannibal when he is on her back. The survivor finds a house where a girl lives alone with her grandmother. The girl marries the hero, but her grandmother is planning ways to destroy him. She junmps into the fire, pretending to be asleep, and when aroused by the hero claims to have dreamed that he mutst kill a monster bird. He accomplishes this test. The next night she repeats the performance and demands that he kill a monster bear. She takes him by boat to the island where the bear is sup- posed to be and maroons him there. Human bones advise him to climb a tree for the night to avoid the animals which the grandmother expects will destroy him, and to surprise her the next day by hiding in the sand when she approaches to discover his fate. He follows this advice and succeeds in marooning the would-be marooner. Five stories (25-29) have as their theme the competition and hostility between older and younger men over women. The relationship be- tween the males is that of uncle and nephew, and since they are said to be living in the same house, or related through the mother of the younger, the uncle referred to is the mother's brother. The women involved are in all cases mates or potential mates for the younger man. In the plot of the first two stories, they are deceived into marrying the older man, and in the cannibal uncle stories the</page><page sequence="11">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 1953] WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 621 nephew's wives become the cannibal's victims. In other words, either by deceit or by crime the older men get the women intended for the younger. The consequences vary. The deceitful uncle is killed, in one case by his nephew, in the other by his nephew's small son. The cannibalistic uncle is cured of his vice in two of the three stories, and in the other he turns into a Monster Bear, and is eventually killed by his nephew's son. "The Wizard Outwitted" shows the older man as a conniving wizard who by deception gets the wife intended for his nephew. Because the wizard knows magically that the girl is on her way to his nephew he exchanges door hangings and head dresses with the younger man. The first girl sent is tricked into marrying the wizard, but her sister who comes later finds and marries the nephew. The wizard returns to the mother-in-law only fox and crow meat-despised food; but the nephew gives much good deer meat in return for the mar- riage-bread gift of the girl. The mother has other daughters for whom she wishes to find husbands, and she investigates a large family of brothers. She finds no meat in the house, for the men are always playing, so decides against sending any of her daughters to that household. This story is quite explicit about marriage customs and the reciprocal food exchanges involved in marriage. The wizard assures his wife that she is married to an important man, for he is a great practitioner of medicine, even if not a great hunter. However, his wife discovers that he practices evil magic and dances with skulls as decorations, so she runs home to her mother, hiding a log substitute in her bed to delay the discovery of her departure. The uncle does not pursue his wife, but decides "not to care." The antagonism between uncle and nephew comes to a climax when the young man's wife breaks a tabu imposed by the uncle. Then the two engage in a contest of magic power. The uncle burns the house by magic, but the nephew restores it by his stronger magic. Then the nephew sur- prises the uncle, by magically approaching him unnoticed, and causes a shower of magic arrows to destroy him. The other version of the same theme starts in a similar way; the girl is deceived into marrying the older man, and the younger man later marries her sister, but the rest of the tale concerns the nephew's son. The title of the tale is "The Mis- chievous Uncle and the Boy Wizard." The boy is indeed a powerful wizard. He grows with super- natural speed, and kills his uncle when the latter steals meat from the boy's father, for in this case too the uncle can kill no game: he "gathers only mushrooms growing on the sides of rotton logs." The rest of the story concerns adventures of the boy wizard; he finds a friend of his own age, drowns some witches, and returns home, bringing with him his friend and his friend's grandmother. There are three stories (27-29) about cannibal uncles. The first two tell of a cannibal who is cured of his vice and reformed. The first one is quite similar to a story given by Parker from the Seneca, though this is from a Tuscarora in- formant. In both stories an uncle and nephew live in a partitioned lodge, the uncle hunting humans and practicing cannibalism, the nephew hunting and eating proper animal food. A wife comes to the nephew, but she is killed and eaten by the uncle. Because of the young man's grief the uncle himself provides a second wife for him, kidnapping her from her people. She is safe from the uncle's viciousness, but her husband is afraid, and the couple flee. In their flight they run into dangers and call upon the uncle, who rescues them. Finally they come to a settlement and an old woman recognizes the cannibal as her son. She cures him of his vice by giving him a fish broth which acts as a purge, and he is changed into a normal eater. The second version tells how the uncle's vice begins when he tastes blood, sucked from his own wound. Subsequently, he kidnaps a baby nephew and takes him to the woods with him. When the boy has grown up, a wife comes to him, but as in the story above, she is killed and eaten by the cannibal. However, a second wife soon appears, and she has magic power. She eludes the uncle when he pursues her, and cures him with a potion which makes him vomit and eradicates his ab- normality. From this point on, the story is con- cerned with a contest between the reformed uncle and a "strong man" who is threatening the village. In a lacrosse game and in a foot-race the uncle defeats the stranger and frees his village from danger. "The Cannibal Uncle and the Boy Hero" com- bines several themes. The situation at the be- ginning is similar to that in the other cannibal uncle stories; a cannibal and his nephew live to- gether in a partitioned house. The uncle kills and eats the first two wives who come to live with the nephew. The third wife has magic which pre- vents the uncle from catching her, but the nephew is afraid and the couple flee. Their flight is a 4Ibid., 284.</page><page sequence="12">622 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. complicated, magical affair; moccasins are sent out to make tracks to confuse the pursuer; the woman is fitted into a spliced arrow and shot ahead; and the man uses the springing tree trick to get well started. They cross a large body of water by using a magic flint which cuts a path for them through the lake. The rest of the story is unrelated to the an- tagonism between uncle and nephew. The per- sons change character and the plot is involved with motifs known from the stories called "Thrown-away" and the "Rolling Head." It is a horror tale in which the nephew changes into a wizard and tries to kill his son with poisoned food; the mother, the wife of the nephew, is killed by the uncle transformled into a Monster Bear, and she becomes a rolling head and pursues her own son until he is able by magic to destroy her. The uncle-monster is finally killed by the nephew's son. Evidently, various tales have been combined in this curious story, and only the first part of it belongs to the cannibal uncle series. Four stories (30-33) are concerned with Atu, who is Winter or Cold personified and usually described as a large man covered with ice. All four of these stories describe a contest between a mortal man and Atu, which illustrates how the theme of contest extends throughout Iroquois fic- tional thinking. In two of the stories supernatural help is given the mortal who overcomes Winter by following the directions given; in the other two tales the mortal is victorious through simple naturalistic methods of withstanding the cold. The first story is a realistic tale and contains much ethnographic detail. A young man called Sodiesgo, but not possessing any of the powers of a trickster, is assisted by his uncle in preparing for winter. Old methods of tanning, making clothing, and fashioning bows and arrows are described. The young fellow speaks disparagingly of the cold, and Atu (Cold himself) appears and challenges him to a contest. The theme of boasting which results in a challenge and subse(luent contest with a supernatural being, wvhich the mortal is enabled to win after many difficulties. is one of the key motifs in Iroquois contest stories. In this story, the matter-of-fact acceptance of a dream as a true message is noteworthy. The defeat of Atu is accomplished by naturalistic means in this tale-a well-protected house, quantities of wood and oil on the fire, actually melt the Ice Man and reduce him to the size of a little boy. Much magic is involved in the second story, "The Hunter and Atu." Atu appears to a hunter alone in the forest and challenges him to a contest. At night a supernatural woman comes to the aid of the frightened man. She gives him advice and charms by which Atu is to be vanquished. Here, as in the following tale, strawberries steeped in liquid are considered antagonistic to Atu. Straw- berry vines are one of the gifts from the super- natural womiian, and are helpful in defeating the Cold. According to the Iroquois, berries appear in the exact spot where the snow lingers longest in the spring; and phrasing this metamiiorphosis in terms of warfare, the berries have vanquished Winter. When the hunter has defeated Atu by imieans of a large fire and the berries and charm, Atu con- cedes defeat and bestows powers in running and hunting, and a magical war-club, upon the lucky hunter. After the contest, the female supernatural re- turns to the hunter and carries him on her back to her realm above the clouds where she lives with many of her kind. They are Fire-Dragons, or Meteors, and look like and are called "lions." Their "king" tries to scare the hunter by appear- ing to him first in his lion's-skin. When he re- moves the skin, he has the appearance of a man and they talk and shake hands. This Fire-Dragon also bestows powers upon the hunter and assures him of a happy marriage. Here is a peculiar type of sympathetic magic-as soon as the miian starts to think ab)out a certain woman of his choice, she will begin to dream of him. This is the prediction of the lion-people, and the last part of the tale tells how the prediction works out. In this story a general tendency to make a class of supernaturals out of a single mythological char- acter is seen at work. As there are a group of Thunderers. Stone Giants, False Faces, so there is a class of Fire-Dragons. The Fire-Dragon was a single supernatural creature in the creation myth, hut here we find a whole tribe of similarlv endowed creatures. "Hunter's Fight with Atu" is brief. Atu ap- pears as a little old man asking for food. When the hunter begrudges him the food, a challenge to a contest is given. Thaw, personified. comes to help the hunter with advice and magical straw- berry vines. When Atu is defeated he presents his conqueror with supernatural power, luck in hunting. "Atu Anecdotes" contains a brief contest, called, in this case, a "party," and various folkloristic be- liefs concerned with Cold are related. Holes in the side of a house mean that the owner is a friend</page><page sequence="13">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 1953] WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 623 of Atu. When the trees crack in winter, that is Atu hammering them. Atu goes home in the spring and comes back to bother men in the fall, but his power is definitely of this world and he will not bother people in the hereafter. There are five stories (34-38) in which flight or escape from a monster, cannibal, or other dangerous witch or wizard predominates in the plot, although other motifs may be present. Can one call flight a type of contest without stretching the concept of contest out of all meaning? The answer is affirmative in the case of these stories, for in them flight is active; it is one kind of op- position, in which obstacles are placed in the path of the pursuer, and assistants come to the aid of the pursued, in such a way as often to be the instru- ments of the pursuer's downfall. "Chased by a Monster" is a magic flight story of the typical Iroquoian scheme. The pursued hunter has two magic objects which make obstacles which deter the pursuer: a magic stone which forms a barricade of rock, and a magic feather which forms an impassable barrier of pigeon ex- crement. With daylight each of these magic tricks is worn out, and the pursuit goes on. Now the young man meets old men who help him: a net- maker who throws nets in the path of the monster and so delays him for awhile; then a pot-maker who heats pots, into which the animal steps and falls, so that the old man can kill him with his war-club. The magic flight is the sole motif in this tale, and it is in an abbreviated form. No reason is given why a monster should be pursuing this man. The man is simply warned by a supernatural voice that he must flee, and he is given charms to aid him in his flight. The monster is not described; it is simply stated that it is a Gaiyagwahi or giant bear. "Uksedaiiha Escapes From a Witch" differs from most of these stories because in it there is an evil witch grandmother who tries to kill her grand- son. Usually the grandmother is the protective, motherly character who cares for the boy hero. The hero in this tale discovers that his grand- mother is going to murder him and he secretly prepares an axe with which to defend himself. He succeeds in killing the old witch and then he runs away. He asks a fish to swallow him and the fish complies with the request. Later, some girls find the fish, caught in a trap, and cut out the little boy, who is unharmed. The eldest girl wants to keep him, but her mother says she must leave home if she does. So she goes off into the forest with the little boy who grows up with astonishing speed and becomes a marvelously good hunter. Flight from a buffalo is the theme of "Ad- ventures of Dreadnaught with Monster Buffalo." No reason is given for the chase, "but the monster followed him for a year without stopping and they went round the world." In flight the boy returns to his starting place and asks for help. Two men prepare to help him: one is the net-maker and the other is the possessor of a magical stone-headed hammer. The net-maker entangles the buffalo and holds it for a time, the hammerer pounds its head and paralyzes it momentarily, but it recovers and continues the chase. Finally, a greater wizard comes to help. He gives the boy some magic vines which enable the boy to run in the air. Then, when the buffalo runs between two trees the boy throws the vines at it. The buffalo becomes en- tangled in the vines and transformed into a huge lump upon one of the trees. "Scalp-Hunters' Adventures" contains other episodes in addition to the story of a flight. The first part of the tale is the story of the gigantic serpent who grows from a little snake to terrific size. It swallows many of the villagers but is killed by one of them, a wizard who knows "about everything." The final episode concerns a war- party which, after taking some scalps of enemies, is pursued and loses one member of its own force. Between these two incidents is the story of a flight from a monster cricket, a Djinosanosgowa. This creature, which is as large as a bear, is a man- eater and it pursues and eats several members of a hunting party, for although they run it is magically able to overtake them. One hunter, running away, comes to the shore of a lake. There a sea-lion man comes to his aid and says he will fight the monster in the man's behalf if the man will assist by pouring water on him while he fights. This fight is a long struggle. "The monster was such a wizard that, when the sea-lion tore its legs off, they began rolling back to join the body. The hunter kept kicking the legs away whenever he could, while the monster kept trying to break away, and at last got free and ran back to its den." At this point the sea-lion changes into a man and tells the hunter that he and the other men can now destroy the monster completely if they will return to its den with some magically treated arrows. This they do, and, when they have burned it, they obtain power from its ashes. The final item in this series, "Boy Hero's Ad- ventures" is also a discursive, episodic tale. A boy is pursued by a Flying Head because he has</page><page sequence="14">624 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AME-R. PHIL. SOC. killed all the frogs in a pond. A wizard, alter ego of the boy, presents him with two magic objects: a small stone which turns into a mountain of rock. and a small chip of wood which creates a barrier of fire. When these charmed creations vanish the Head goes on in pursuit, but it is finally stopped by a lake which the boy is able to cross with the aid of an alligator. On the other side of the water the boy gets into more trouble. He braves and kills a cannibal giant and resuscitates the giant's victims. An episode which explains why the fox is yellow, and another which con- cerns a blind crayfish-woman's search for water are appended without much cohesion. II. MAGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANIMALS Though animals, as allies, magical assistants, or messengers may assist either the hero or his opponents in the hero-contest tales, animals are not of primary importance to the theme. There is a group of stories, however (3966), in which re- lationships between men and animals are para- mount to the development of the plot. The relationship between the hunter and the animals he hunts, an important one in actuality, is the theme of the story of the animals who re- venge a broken hunting tabu. This tale, of which there are three versions (39-41), tells of a hunter who has magical hunting powers and magical pro- cedures which carry with them a tabu against being watched. This proscription is broken by a curious female relative. In two cases the offender is the hunter's wife, in the other his sister-in-law. In revenge the animals in a body descend upon the hunter and kidnap him. The moose carries the hunter away on his back, and the other animals run in a gigantic circle, the man a captive in their midst. In one version, the son of the kidnapped hunter and the disobedient peeping wife is a wizard, who grows with supernatural speed and determines to resctue his father whom he hears singing in the distance. The boy finds the deep circular track made by the kidnappers and uses one of his father's magic flints to kill the moose which carries his father, whereupon the other animals disband. The bov takes his father home and the family is reunited. One version has the grand- mother in the role of rescuer. These stories reinforce the tabu against women having any knowledge of hunting magic. In all of them women are the offenders. The animals themselves apply the sanctions; the consequences are dangerous but not fatal to the hunter; and the magic itself is not impaired, for after his misad- ventures the hunter is as effective as before. Another actual relationship, that between a hunter and his dogs, is the basis of the story of the self-sacrificing dogs. That five versions of "The Faithful Dogs" were recorded shows this to have been a favorite, well-rememnbered story. ft is a simple tale. Briefly, a man alone in his hunting shack is warned by one of his talking dogs that a monster is about to attack him and that the dogs will do all they can to delay the monster if the man wvill flee. Usually, during his flight the dogs report to the hunter on the progress of the monster as he kills off the dogs one by one. When the last dog is gone, the man reaches a settlement and tells his story. A revenge party is sent out to search for the monster and sometimes succeeds in destroying it. There is variation in the different reasons given for the monster's pursuit of the man, the number of dogs varies from two to seven, and the pursuing monster may be a Flying Head, a Giant Lizard, or simiply some horrible creature, described as peculiarly dreadful, hairy, etc. As a seqluel, the man may bury the dogs with human rites, or he nmay be afraid to be out alone thereafter. In one story (42) another episode is added. The dogs reappear and guide their former master on a journey to Dog Heaven. Here a Cerberus guards the entrance. The story ends humorously-the little dog runs away to look for a (Irink of water and never comes back again. Throughout most of the fiction animals appear as allies or assistants to humans, talking an(d acting like humans, and sometimes in a typical guardian or totem-animal role. Four tales (47-50) tell of the beginning of such a relationship. The animals involved are the sea-lion, the blacksnake, the bear, the squirrel, and the toad. In one case, that of the blacksnake, the animal is invoked, asked to come and wrestle with the man who seeks power from it. The snake appears and wrestles with the mlan. The man is stalwart, but is forced to give up. As a reward the snake bestows strength in wrestling. In the other three stories the human recipient is pitiable and receives the friendship and help of the animal unsolicited. One case is that of a poor orphaned girl who is befriended by a female sea- lion, taken to the sea-lion's underwater lodge, and given magical curing powers for the rest of her life. Another case is that of an orphaned boy. A l)ear beconmes his foster-miother ancl gives him</page><page sequence="15">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 19531 WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 625 power to locate and kill bears when he returns to human society. The squirrel and the toad appear in one story (50) as aids in a bitterly contested game of lacrosse. The squirrel appears as a man to the hero and gives him vague promises of help. The man who has the squirrel ally is successful in the end. This is a rather discursive and confusing story, but the information as to the magical procedures involved in the game of lacrosse is interesting. Since animals talk and act like humans through- out these stories, it is only natural that marital and other sexual relationships between humans and other species sometimes occur. Among non- human spouses, the watersnake or serpent is the most common. There are two versions (51 and 52) of a story about a girl who refuses human suitors and is wooed and elopes with a serpent- man. He takes her to his underwater lodge where he appears to her sometimes as a snake, sometimes as a man. Like the wizards and witches of many tales, the serpents have external souls which hang under their beds. With the aid of a Thunderer, the girl is able to steal these hearts and make her escape. The Thunderer frees the girl from con- tamination by removing the snake progeny from her body, and then marries her himself. The Thunder Boy, product of this union, should not be corrected-the prohibition against offending a supernatural spouse is a widespread motif, and here it is applied to the child-and, when he is rebuked by his mother, both he and his father de- part. In this connection Thunderers appear as a class of supernatural men, friendly to mortals and ini- mical to underground and underwater creatures, especially the water serpents. So it is logical for Thunderers to aid the woman who has become involved with the water snake. The Thunderers often solicit the aid of humans in their war against evil creatures, and in this tale the brother of the snake's wife helps the Thunderer in the rescue. Dire consequences follow the eating of fish. Two stories (53 and 54) tell how humans, in one story a woman, in the other a man, are trans- formed into water snakes and married to snakes, as a consequence of eating fish and developing an unappeasable thirst thereby. These tales rein- force the tabu against the eating of fish, and they reflect the fear and suspicion attached to water creatures, snakes especially. The sexual aspects of these stories are not uppermost, but the trans- formation and subsequent sexual union with ser- pents accentuate the repugnance felt toward these creatures. Misfortune in the form of a snake spouse over- takes both man and woman (55 and 56). In each case the serpent spouse is viewed as a punishment for those who are recluses and refuse to partici- pate in normal human sexual conduct. The suitor-symbol appears as a motif in "The Marriage of Atu" and in "The Six Suitors." In the former, the girl, although instructed to pick up only the buckskin covered ball which is the symbol of an Indian suitor, selects a smooth and glassy ball, the token of Atu or Winter. Claimed by the Winter God as wife, the girl suffers in his cold kingdom, but finally she escapes and regains her home. Their son seeks his father in an under- water world and prevails upon his father to grant the people warmer weather when they invoke him with the incense of tobacco. In "The Six Suitors" arrows are used as sym- bols for different suitors. An unpainted arrow represents a man; the other colored arrows stand for various animals. The youngest of a group of daughters obeys her mother, selects the unpainted arrow, and is rewarded with a human husband. All her sisters, who have refused many suitors in the past, are punished by selecting animal hus- bands with their painted arrows. Again, the re- fusal to accept suitors brings misfortune. In "The Young Man Who Wouldn't Marry" a male recluse is punished for his lonely life. A supernatural wife visits him, and entreats him not to ask any service of her. When he breaks this tabu she is transformd into mere bones, for she was a revenant, the worst kind of wife a man could have. Adultery with an animal, a giant-woodpecker- man, occurs in "The Unfaithful Wife." When her infidelity is discovered, the wife flees with her paramour, and the husband and children set out in pursuit. The story is confused and has no logi- cal ending; perhaps the informant failed to recall the whole story. In many tales we find men able to change into various animals and, similarly, animals which transform themselves into men on occasion. Children were sometimes threatened with the pos- sibility of being changed into birds or animals, or being abducted by birds or animals if they were lazy or disobedient. In "The Bad Boy and The Giant Crow" such an abduction takes place but with no ill effects. In "Laziness Punished" a shirker is transformed into a cuckoo. Failure to accept a suitor is punished again in</page><page sequence="16">626 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. "The Young Woman Who Wouldn't Marry." This story tells how a giant muskrat, transformed into an infant boy, wrecks havoc in the life of a recluse girl who adopts him but is unable to get rid of him. He effects the death of many young men in the village, but finally relents and leaves the human group. The final tale included in this group, "Contest of Awehoont and Haniasez" is a story of such confusion as to the animal or human nature of the two main characters that it is impossible to be sure whether it is simply an animal story of a foot-race and lacrosse game between Humming- Bird and Crane, or whether men with the names of the title possess power to transform themselves into birds and utilize birds for transportation and assistance. III. HUMOROUS TALES Eleven stories deal with trickery and deception, but the trickster, Sodiesgo, appears in only four of them. In these tales Sodiesgo generally displays the role which gives him his name, "He who often abuses people by craft." 5 Sodiesgo appears in these tales as a man, there is no trace of an ani- mal nature, but he has powers of transformation and changes himself at will into a little boy, a good-looking young man, or a hunter. Like most trickster tales, these stories are epi- sodic and consist of loosely connected incidents; the trickster usually simply travels on from one ad- venture to the next. The roles of the trickster are inconsistent: in one episode he may be the clever deceiver, in another he performs a kindly action, in another he himself is duped and dies. The most common incidents are of a lecherous or cruel character. This unrestrained sexuality and destructiveness show that he represents the unsocialized male. The humor of the tales de- pends on this: Sodiesgo does what is definitely "not done." The trickster's animalistic sexuality is illus- trated by his copulation with girls in swimming, or as they cross logs, and his marriage to a bear. In pursuit of amorous adventures he dupes the people and he takes advantage of the cupidity and fear of others to dupe them. Wanton cruelty is the trickster's character in an episode where he tricks a grandmother into eating the body of her dead grandson, at a time when Sodiesgo himself is playing the role of a substitute for the dead boy. The grandmother tries to punish Sodiesgo, but his magic is superior and he finally kills her. These trickster tales are not well-developed, nor thoroughly thought out. In one of them there is even some confusion as to the identity of the protagonist. The hunter, who is Sodiesgo, cures the men who have sharpened their legs to spear fish because Sodiesgo told them to! No doubt the informants were self-conscious about telling such tales to an ethnologist. The humor is coarse, and informants would hesitate to translate it into English, fearing condemnation for vulgarity. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to say whether this is a fair sample of the trickster stories told about thirty-five years ago, a periodl of more linguistic prudery than the present. Skanawadi (literally "over the swamp" or Hare) appears in only one story, a humorous tale of mutual fear of a Stone-coat and Skanawadi. Each runs away from the other, bIut they keep on meeting, only to run away again. The story ends, "The Stone-coat sprang up shouting, 'Spare me! Spare me!' and ran off again at full speed. Skanawadi ran for his boat, pushed it off and lay down in it, and it may be that both he and the Stone-coat are going yet." Skanawadi is called a man in this tale, and he shows no attributes of the Hare, unless his fearfulness and httmor can be called such. Stone-coats appear in two other stories, but in these as well as in the illustration above, they are rather stupid and easily frightened monsters. Ac- cording to Hewitt, Stone-coats are monstrous giants, covered with a layer of stone. They ap- pear in the stories in the Hewitt-Curtain collection as cannibals, feared but often overcome bvn men. Parker describes them as "beings like unto men, but of gigantic size and covered with coats of flint. They are not gods and are vulnerable to the as- saults of celestial powers, though the arrows of men harm them not at all. The early Iroquois are reputed to have had many wars with them, and the last one is said to have been killed in a cave." 6 In the Waugh collection the Stone-coats are easily duped and outwitted by men who pursue them and trick themn. In one case the man throws stones in the river. The foolish Stone-coat thinks these noises are made by the man and pursues the stones until he drowns. Another Stone-coat is frightened and runs away because a bottle makes the dreadful sound of "bu, but bu." In one tale a Stone-coat nmakes a man's axe magically sharp 5 Hewitt, J. N. B., and J. Curtin, Seneca fiction, legentds, and myths, 32nd Annutal Report, Butreau of American Etli- nology, 283, 1918. '; Ibid., 18.</page><page sequence="17">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 1953] WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 627 enough to cut stone by putting his own magic saliva upon it. Since this is the man's axe the Stone-coat now fears the man and runs away from him. The Stone-coat tries to buy off his pur- suer but the man blows in his face and kills him with the axe which the Stone-coat himself has rendered so magically potent. Three tales contain some episodes that might be attributed to a trickster, though Uksedaiiha, the typical Hans or Jack of the hero stories, per- forms them. The protagonist's character varies; sometimes he behaves like a trickster, sometimes like a hero. In one episode the trickster seems to be an impersonation of Hare, for he dupes a grandmother into a liaison with himself, trans- formed into an old man, and this results in the birth of a little hare. Another episode tells of the rescue of a magic food supply, the typical exploit of a culture-hero. In another tale the trickster himself is rather lewdly duped when he tries to produce a wife by magic. In one story the hero succeeds in a round-the- world fight with a monster buffalo, but after this adventure he behaves like Sodiesgo: he sells a wasps' nest, and he tricks a Stone-coat into dancing with pine-knots-an episode similar to the bulrush dance found in so many trickster cycles. "The Turtle, the Toad, and the Skunk" is a short version of Big Turtle's War Party, of which Thompson writes, "One of the most popular trickster tales in the Plains and in all the neighbor- ing areas is Big Turtle's War Party. The ad- ventures in this tale are always ascribed to the turtle, although he is not ordinarily considered as a trickster."' Trickster tales amuse by their violation of cus- tom, and by their expression of cruelty, destruc- tiveness, and animalistic sexuality. More truly humorous are the two versions of "The Foolish Nephew." This story tells of realistic and grotesque errors made by a young man when he misunderstands directions given him by his uncle. Many of the episodes depend for their humor on puns or pseudo-puns, similarities of words in the native language, and consequently the translation falters over the joke. Both versions tell of the nephew who shoots at the uncle's pointing finger or pointing lips in- stead of at the game pointed at. Both relate mis- takes in the invitation and treatment of guests at a feast, and of cooking inedible objects instead of animal products because the boy takes the literal meaning of a word instead of its appropriate ex- tension. Both stories end with grotesque blunders of the youth while out courting. In one version the ending is humorous, but in the other the boy kills his girl instead of wooing her and he and his uncle are forced to flee, which they do literally, by transforming themselves into owls. Though the errors are violent and cruel, the linguistic sophisti- cation of these stories makes these ridiculous blunders amusing. IV. TALES OF EUROPEAN DERIVATION OR INFLUENCE The twenty tales in this collection which are patently European in derivation are typical of the stories borrowed from the French by the Iroquois and their Indian neighbors.8 They consist of ten tales of magic and wonder, nine trickster and ani- mal stories, and one version of a Biblical story. This selection of borrowed tales, and its propor- tions, is representative of the extent to which French stories were accepted, remolded, and re- told by the Indian tribes of this area. All of the tales contain motifs of plot and details of culture which are not aboriginal, yet all of them recog- nizably differ from their European counterparts in thematic -treatment and in the inclusion of de- tails and motifs taken from Iroquoian folk tales. Some of them differ much more markedly from their European analogues than do others. For the most part, these tales are thoroughly representative of those which have gained the widest acceptance in North America. Seventeen of the twenty are among the themes listed by Thompson as stories of European origin most frequently found to have been borrowed by the North American Indians.9 There are four versions (80-83) of the Euro- pean tale called, "The Extraordinary Compan- ions." The skeleton of the story-that the hero is aided in contests by a group of companions, each of whom possesses some marvelous power- is present in all of the versions. Two versions, however, belong to the more complex type of the story called "The Ship that Went on Sea and Land." A canoe which flies is known from the aboriginal Indian tales as well as in these borrowed stories. In the old Iroquois stories it is often described as a canoe made of wampum, and it may be pro- 7Thompson, Stith, The folktale, 322, N. Y., Dryden, 1946. 8 Ibid., 286. 9Ibid., 288 ff.</page><page sequence="18">628 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE {PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. pelled through the air by birds which are called by the magician's potent song, or by birds which are painted on the sides of the canoe and come to life at the wizard's call. The flying craft in "The Gifted Companions" is described as an "Indian dug-out" in distinction to the masted, sailing ships which the travelers see as they fly over the ocean. The contests are an amalgam of Iroquoian and European elements. In "Dreadnaught Wins Tests" when the hero's opponents have lost one game they do not pay the forfeit, but propose another competition as they would in the aboriginal tales, and the final contest is a fight as it so often is in the hero-contest stories. In this tale, when all the games have been lost, a surprise attack upon the hero and his friends is planned by his enemies, but the Good Listener overhears the plot and the surprise attack is instead launched by the hero. The romantic motive of the European stories- usually the king's daughter is to be the reward for the successful competitor-is either lacking com- pletely or is turned into a joke by the Iroquois story-teller. In "The Magical Gift" the hero, when he learns that the mayor's daughter will be the reward for the man who can build a ship which can travel over both land and sea, says that if he had such a boat he wouldn't "want to marry the mayor's daughter." "The Strong Man" and "A Giant Story" are two Iroquoian versions of Strong John. The two stories are quite similar, and both are humorous in the Paul Bunyan tradition. The master of a supernaturally large and strong fellow tries to do away with his inconvenient slave, but he is unable to rid himself of him. In desperation he sends him to Hell to bring back the master's father. The hero returns with the devil himself as well as all the old men, for he cannot pick out the one wanted. Both of these tales lack elaboration and are very close to their European analogues. By contrast, "The Incestuous Marriage Pro- posal" is a thoroughly Indianized version of the Cinderella story. It completely lacks the romantic motivation and happy ending of the European tale. Instead of a cruel step-mother, an incestuous father drives the heroine away from home. An old woman (the fairy god-mother) gives her a magic bag and directs her to seek refuge with three sisters (the ugly step-sisters). The girls impose tasks to keep the heroine away from the Longhouse (ball). They scatter a basketful of beans which small animals aid the heroine to pick up. Transported to the Longhouse by magic, our heroine sits alone in a corner, an object of beautv and curiosity. But no prince appears to dance with her. Instead, her father comes to the Longhouse. The girl denounces him and the unkind sisters, and Elijah- like ascends into the sky. This tale illustrates how plot details move freely and attach thenmselves to various thenmes and contexts. A series of nmotifs from the Cinderella story are woven into a tale whose thenme is the successful eltuding of an in- cestuous father. "The Forgotten Wife" contains many of the miiotifs of the tale generally called "The White Cat," though it lacks the miiotif from which that title derives. In this version, the usual swan- miaiden mlotif is replaced by swimnming girls. The hero steals their dresses and will not return them until they tell their names. The native attach- ment of importance to names here replaces the more fanciful swan-coat miotif. As in mnost ver- sions, the girl helps the hero with tasks imposed by her father, and aids hiIm in their magic flight, which includes a magic horse and other details derived fromii the European tale. The wife is forgotten when a tabu against kiss- ing, imposedI by her, is broken by a dog. So the hero prepares to marry again, but at the wvedding feast the first wife reappears and a typical Iroquo- ian contest inl magic ensues between the two women. Finally, a talking hen and rooster re- enact the father-in-lawr tasks and( so arouse the hero's miiemiioryr-a detail which has been borrowed in manv onther \merican Indiain v-ersionis of the tale. "An Indian 'Jack the Giant-Killer'" combines two of the European tales most popular in Amer- ica. These are "The Seven Headed Dragon" and "John the Bear" and the tale as a whole is thor- oughly European, though the incidents lack elabor- ation. The combination of these two stories leaves the hero with two rescued princesses. To escape this impasse without bigamy the story-teller adds a third princess and has the hero take two girls home to be his brothers' wives. The highly com- petitive brothers of the European tales are not congenial to Iroquoian thought and the story-teller has amended the tale so that it is consonant with an uncomlpetitive attituide in regar(d to woiiieii es- pecially among brothers. "A Castaway's Adventures" is a iuiticlh ab- breviated, buit thoroughly Euiropeain, version of "The Enchanted Horse." The horse, the golden hair, the cow-bells, sailing ships, p)ancakes, kings, all are foreign to the Iroquois. "The Handless MTIaiden" is also a brief story,</page><page sequence="19">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 1953] WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 629 probably related to the European story, "The Maiden Without Hands," and it shows incomplete adaptation to Iroquoian patterns. Three tales (91-93) are of the European trick- ster type. "The Foolish Boy" is a combination of elements from "Jack the Numskull" and "Jack the Trickster." Such stories are always episodic and may consist of any number of incidents, ar- ranged in any order. Here we have the race with the pot, the search for the needle in the load of hay, the attempt to dry up the flooded cellar with flour, and killing a child with an axe when swatting a fly. After this last fatal error the hero runs away, but he gains wealth by falling on robbers who are counting their gold under the tree in which he is hiding, so he returns home and lives happily with his mother. The literal-minded mistakes of the foolish boy are somewhat similar to the literal-minded errors of the boy in "The Foolish Nephew" but the hu- mor of the situations is not as well assimilated nor as well developed in this European tale. "The Trickster Defeated" shows undoubted bor- rowing in the major incident of the action: the sale of magic, self-returning articles. However, the trickster, called by the Iroquois name, Sodiesgo, has many native traits. This is a well-adapted tale, an example of the amalgama- tion of elements from the two folktale traditions: for instance, red-osier dogwood, the typical Iro- quoian magic material, is utilized as a European magic wand which can fill a table with food. Another tale, "The Stone-coats Outdone," uses European incidents in a story about typical Iroquoian characters: Uksedaiiha, the genuine little-boy hero of Iroquois stories, and the Stone- coats, those stupid, stone-clad giants. The substi- tution of a bird for a stone in a throwing contest, and biting a cheese instead of a stone, are borrowed from European tales. Two versions of "The Fox as Trickster" (94, 95) combine in various order incidents from the European cycle of animal stories; and "The Rac- coon and the Crayfish" is simply one incident from the same series. Among others, these stories in- clude: diving for cheese, fishing with tail, the cowardly duellers, and playing dead to catch game. "The Adventures of Turtle" consists of two in- cidents. One is the well-known deception by turtle who wins the race by concealing his relatives along the course. The second is the story of tricking the deer into killing himself. "The Animals and Ikdjin" is similar to the cowardly duellers story. The animals in council decide to kill their enemy lkdj in. Several who are deputed kill the wrong person and when Ikdjin is finally found they all run away. Per- haps Ikdjin is the house-cat, whose tail looks like a gun when standing upright. Only one version of a Biblical story is found in this collection. This is a thoroughly Indianized tale of Joseph and his brethren. It is surprising that although dreams were treated with as much respect by the Iroquois as by the ancient Hebrews, the Iroquois version does not retain the dream notification of Joseph, either of his supremacy among the brothers, nor of the coming famine. Instead, birds and cows tell him of coming events. 2. TALES OF ORIGINS AND OTHER-WORLD JOURNEYS Compared with the variety and extent of the fiction in this collection, those stories which might be classed as myths, for they deal with origins, with the ordering of human life, and with the nature of the other-world, are scanty indeed. Only sixteen tales (64 pages of text) belong in this category. I. ORIGIN STORIES There are three versions of the Cosmogonic Myth (100-102). The first is an Oneida version of the well-known myth, and it is the most elab- orated of the three. It contains most of the es- sential points: the sky-world, the uprooting of the light-giving tree, and the casting down of the sky- woman; the animals' diving for earth, and the es- tablishment of the earth on the turtle's back; the sky-woman's daughter becomes the mother of twins, the Good and Evil-minded ones; the Good- minded, a culture-hero, liberates the animals pent up by his brother, and secures corn; the brothers have a world-shaking, cosmic battle, and they fight until nothing is left of them except their bones which are gathered up by their grandmother; the story ends when Good-minded says he will re- turn on the last day of the world. The second Cosmogonic myth is a confused version from a Cayuga informant who evidently had forgotten the story. The twins are abducted by a roc or giant crow. Then the story changes completely: Uksedaiiha, a culture-hero now, insti- tutes the Great Feather Dance and other cultural forms such as the moiety system. A third version comes from a Tuscarora and combines some of the elements of the old myth, such as the earth-diving and the founding of the earth on the turtle's back, with some modern</page><page sequence="20">630 MARTHA CHAMPION RANDLE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. ideas, such as the evolution of man from apes in four generations. Only two brief items (103, 104) are concerned with constellations. The first tells how, when some children are refused food for their cere- monial, they dance on into the sky to form the constellation which we call "The Pleiades." "The Legend of the Dipper" is a similar type of ex- planation of a group of stars. This constellation is said to be a bear with three hunters following him, the first hunter carrying a pot upon his back. "Dangerous Monsters Overcome" and "De- garohiawago and the Great Mosquito" are ac- counts of how the animals of today are descended from monsters of similar characteristics, an idea found in much Iroquoian folkloristic material. The theory is that at one time there were gigantic prototypes of the animals we know today. These monsters were a great menace to mankind. Their destruction, usually accomplished by a man with the aid of some supernatural being, resulted in the small animals that we know today, not dangerous to man, but sometimes a pest as in the case of the mosquitoes. II. THE ORDERING OF HUMAN AFFAIRS The stories which deal with the origins of cere- monial affairs (107-109) reflect the closeness felt to exist between men and animals. The "Origin of Ganoda" is the story of the discovery of the semi-mystical medicine, Ganoda, by the wolf and his animal associates, and the restoration of a dead hunter, a great friend of the animals, by means of it. Both "The Origin of the Bear So- ciety and Ceremony" and "The Hunter and the Haguks" tell how a man was abducted by an ani- mal which behaved towards him like a foster- parent. On the man's return to human society, unharmed, he instituted rites connected with the abducting animal. "Culture Hero's Gifts" is the sole account of this kind in the collection. The culture-hero is probably the same as the Good-minded twin of the creation story and the Earth Grasper of Hewitt's long legend.10 In this tale, the culture-hero, an un- known stranger, visits a poor old woman and hunts to supply food for her and her granddaughter. He beautifies the ugly girl and then marries her. Curiosity is aroused about his powers and the chief of the village questions him as to his identity. The stranger says only that he has come from "above the sun." He explains to the people the uses of various medicinal plants, barks, and roots, and gives them corn, beans, and squash. It is not until his departure that he reveals his name. The episode of the powerful stranger visiting the poor woman is a secular rather than a mytho- logical motif, but other parts of the story, for ex- ample the youths who follow the departing hero's footsteps and consequently discover the food plants, are found in the Hewitt myth. There are two stories (111, 112) of the gift of corn by a supernatural spouse. "The Story of Gosadea" tells how an especially good hunter, who has done a good deed by naming a new chief for the trees, is rewarded by having a supernatural Corn Maiden for wife. His brother acts disre- spectfully toward the corn and as a consequence the wife goes back to her old home and takes the corn with her. The husband seeks his lost wife and succeeds in finding her. He brings back the corn but not the Corn Maiden. "How Corn was Obtained" is essentially the same story. However. the hero is a virgin, a man who has long refused to marry, and, according to the usual pattern in the tales, he should be punished rather than rewarded for his non-acceptance of the usual sexual m-iores. But in the rationale of fiction, one wouil(d say that strange things happen to him because he is a strange man. The Curtin-Hewitt collection has four stories which concern the acquisition of corn and related ceremonies and songs. One of them is similar to the two stories discussed here." III. OTHER-WORLD JOURNEYS The collection contains three stories of journeys to another world (113-115). The first two show some similarities to the long myth, recorded by Hewitt, in both Seneca and Onondaga.'2 In "The Young Man Who Went to Where the Sun Sets," two young men set out to the west to find out "how far the sun goes at sundown." One of them is caught by a gigantic spider web, but the other, with the supernatural guidance of one of the Thunder- ers, succeeds in reaching the place where the sky rises and falls. He runs underneath while the skv is up and attains the other world, where the Thunderers live. They take him on various of their rain-making expeditions and then return him to his home. As in the Hewitt tales, he is an o0(1 man upon his return, and this makes the second 10 Hewitt, J. N.

The hero and his mother journey to another region where the hero marries and settles down. Later, his mother wants to return to her old home and asks the son to accompany her. His wife is opposed to the move, but the hero leaves, his duty to his mother being stronger than his duty to his wife. This conflict of responsibility might be an indication that the story is old, as modern thought would not emphasize a man's duty to his mother to such an extent. "Hunting Adventures and the Hereafter" be- gins with an episode extraneous to the other-world journey; a good hunter does the trees a service by appointing a new tree as their chief. Abruptly, the story-teller embarks on a story about five boys who start out on a trip and reach the place of the rising and falling sky. They pass under and are entertained by the Thunderers. One boy volun- teers to stay and assist the Thunderers in their tasks. The place they visit is a vague land of the dead, and one of them falls in love with a girl there. In order to remain with her he must die, so he lets the falling sky crush him. The others re- turn home and identify themselves with difficulty for they have been gone so long. "The Man Who Went Round the World" is a Tuscarora tale of a visit to the land of the dead, and it differs markedly from the others. At a council it is decided that a good runner shall be sent out to investigate the world, starting out toward the west. Should the runner not return another is to set out. A fine runner sets forth, first leaving a life-token, a robin which will cry out if the man is killed. He crosses lakes by dreaming; he en- counters strange people with whom he must con- verse in sign language; he is given a bag of gold but he leaves it because it is too heavy; he meets but eludes some Stone-coats; he hibernates for the winter by magically covering himself with stone. After crossing a bleak, frozen land, he comes to the shadowy country of the dead where an unidentified supernatural being acts as his guide. He sees White people working hard, while Indians take their ease. He returns through the forest, en- countering monkeys and strange tribes of Indians, but finally regaining his home. It is difficult for him to identify himself, for he has been gone so long that none of his contemporaries is living. He recounts his experiences in detail. Tinged as it is with allusions to Whites, Heaven, monkeys, gold, etc., this tale is certainly of quite recent com- position. 3. ITEMS OF HISTORICAL OR ANECDOTAL CHARACTER I. PSEUDO-HISTORICAL TALES Legendary or pseudo-historical items are four (116-119), and two of them are concerned with Tadodahu, the semi-historical Onondaga chief.'3 That so few items of this nature were collected in comparison with fiction seems to show that the life of fiction is hardier than that of this legendary material. "A Story of Tadodahu" describes the chief as a wizard, living root-entangled, and able to divine by smoking. He defeats a simple-minded Stone- coat by persuading him to hang up his coat by the fire. "A Story of Tadodahu and Deganawida" de- scribes the supernatural birth of Deganawida and the inability of his grandmother to dispose of him. The main episode in the story, a contest between Tadodahu and Deganawida is rather vague. The tale ends with a list of chiefs' names given by Deganawida, the supposed founder of the Con- federacy. The story states that Tadodahu hung up strings of wampum to designate the tribes he had conquered, though other tales credit Degana- wida with the invention of wampum.'4 The acquisition of chieftainship by praiseworthy conduct in one case and by a tribal division in another is described in "Chieftainship by Merit and Otherwise." This tale is of ethnological in- terest because of the information it gives on such customs as: the resignation of one man in favor of another who has a stronger claim to chieftainship because of war exploits, the protective measures used in camping and building stockades, and the traditional formulae for expressing various threats. Because of the description of peace-making in "The Man-Eating Monster Defeated" it belongs in this group of tales. Good-looking young girls are sent out with strings of white wampum to in- vite an enemy group to a peace-making assembly, and there are other details of ethnographic interest. However, the second part of the tale is fictional: a monster bear is defeated by a young and formerly despised hero who frightens the monster and re- ceives a tooth charm from him. A horse aids the hero in his contest, taking a role similar to that of the faithful dog in older stories. 13 Converse, H. M., Myths and legends of the New York State Iroquois, N. Y.

TALES AND ANECDOTES ABOUT THE THUNDERERS There are eight brief anecdotes about the Thunderers (120-127), those anthropomorphic supernatural beings whose chief duty it is to make rain. The Thunderers also appear in some of the animal-spouse stories, where their antagonism to water monsters and their enlisting of men as help- ers have already been noted. In the Other-world journeys they appear as guides to their human visitors, whom they take with them-i on rain-making expeditions. Sometimes they also purify a mortal by pounding him in a mortar, after which he be- comes one of them. The number of Thunderers differs; in some stories only one of them appears, but in general this one is thought of as belonging to a group of four or five Thunderers, all with simi- lar characteristics. Both the Thunderers' antagonism toward water creatures and their frequent need of human as- sistance in fighting them are illustrated in "Giant Bloodsucker Overcome." In "The Hunter and the Ganiakwaie" a Thunderer helps a man defeat a monster bear. "The Great Serpent Overcome" tells how thunder and lightning drive a monstrous horned serpent back into the water. This is one anecdote in which Thunder does not appear in his usual anthropomorphic guise. Two brief items (123, 124) tell of the adoption of a human being as an assistant to the Thunderers. "Origin of Distant Thunder" is a fragment from a story of an Other-world journey, and tells how the man who didn't succeed in the dash under the rising and falling sky was taken as a helper for the Thunder Men, first having been purified by being pounded in a mortar. These human Thunderers are thought to be not as powerful as their supernatural counterparts, and so they be- come low or distant thunder. The Thunderers are a source of power to men in two anecdotes. In "Power Received from Thunderer" the power is not sought, but comes fortuitously to two little boys to whom the Thunderer appears as another youngster. This supernatural boy plays lacrosse with them and helps them to victory. He confers great strength in games and physical contests upon both of the boys. "Thunder Man as Puberty Spirit" describes how power was sought by boys at the age of puberty. "In olden times they used to take a boy wvho had arrived at puberty away out into the woods, so far that he could not go back home. They would leave him there alone for ten davs with a single cob of corn. At the end of that time they would return. . . . The boy would also make a friend of one of the larger animals and receive good luck from it." In this story, a Thunder Man appears to a boy isolated in this fashion in the woods. He confers physical strength and prowess upon the boy, tells him of Thunderers fighting with water monsters, and gives him a feather talisman which when waved back and forth shows lightning on its tip. III. VAMPIRES, REVENANTS, AND OTHER FOLKLORE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEAD Fourteen short tales and anecdotes (128-141) concern the dead, either as vampires or as reve- nants. There are five versions of "The Vampire Corpse." This is one of most popular Iroquois stories and is found in practically all of the col- lections. That so many versions were collected at Six Nations about 1915 shows how well-known it was at that time. The story is simple: a group of people, two or more men, or a married couple with or without a child, stay overnight in a lodge on the trail. During the night one of the party is attacked and eaten by a vampire, for a sorcerer's corpse has been left in the shack and has turned vampire. The remaining member or members of the party attempt escape, usually talking first in matter-of-fact tones so that the vampire shall be deceived as to their knowledge of its deed. Some member of the party effects his escape and reaches a community where he relates his ex- perience. The next day a party is sent out to investigate and finds the corpse with blood upon it. A further destruction of the corpse, by tomahawk, by burning, or by earth burial, then takes place. Generally, this story is accompanied by a discus- sion of the various forms of burial, and is given as one reason why the ancient custom of burial in a bark case inside a shack or on a scaffold in the trees was abandoned. Neglecting to feed the corpse is given in two tales as the reason for its attack upon the travelers. and in another version the travelers have stolen the food left for the corpse. The corpse is thought of as having some of the attributes of the living, for sometimes it is exhorted not to practice evil, and in two versions the corpse indicates regret for its evil deeds, for it is found weeping. Fear of the dead, especially the dead wizard or witch, is revealed as intense by the evidence of these tales. The rest of the items in this category are brief and their titles explain them. Some tell how seeing a ghost presages the death of those who</page><page sequence="23">VOL. 97, NO. 5, 19531 WAUGH COLLECTION OF IROQUOIS FOLKTALES 633 see it. More of them are modern in tone and are told as actual occurrences, happening to specific individuals. Only one is comical: "The Graveyard Hostelry" which tells how two drunken Indians find lodging with ghosts in their graves when they have been sent away from the hotel. IV. ANECDOTES, CHILDREN' S STORIES, AND OTHER FOLKLORISTIC ITEMS Sixteen brief items (142-157) complete the roster of tales. Two are short fables for children. In the first a fawn dreams that corn is in his nose, an omen that he will soon be in corn soup. The second is the fable of the woodcock and the worm: the bird gets a good dinner by giving worms a ride towards Heaven. There are two versions (147, 148) of a story about starvation. In one version a child tries to tell her starving parents that there is a deer drowned in a spring nearby. The parents cannot -understand the child's words and kill her for food. The punishment is dire; the mother dies and the father becomes insane. In the other version all -turns out well; a starving hunter is about to kill his child, when a deer, about which the child has been trying to tell, is found by her mother. The intended crime is punished by the villagers who administer a public whipping to the father when they hear the story. Two stories are fragmentary, the informant evi- dently having been unable to finish the story. "The Pigmy's Cave" is interesting as the sole remnant of folklore about "the little people" in this collection. It tells how the Pigmies wish to exchange garden produce which they grow for red squirrels of which they are afraid but which they greatly desire, and the tale takes it for for granted that a profitable trade could be established between the Pigmies and the people. "An Indian 'Tom Thumb'" is a comical story which bears some resemblance to the "Foolish Nephew" stories; it has some scatological allusions and perhaps for this reason, the informant did not finish it. "The Magical Pipe and the Blind Hunter" is the description of how two sets of magical birds perform. A blind hunter has a pair of magic chickadees which direct him so that he can shoot game. Finally, they misdirect him and he shoots an old woman. Fearing vengeance, he runs away. The magical pipe is the prized possession of a young hunter. Two live pigeons perch beside this pipe and light it at its owner's request. One day the pigeons fail to perform their duty and the next day the young man is dead. The remaining items belong to that strange borderland between fiction and reality, where strange, magical, or monstrous things are attrib- uted to actual persons, and the time and place of the actual occurrence may be specified. In "The Disobedient Boy" disrespect toward Hawenniyu causes a supernatural fire to follow a lazy boy. The strange and violent omen scares him into good conduct and he later becomes a well-known preacher. "Wizards Punished" tells as an his- torical tale how real men turn into wizards which have the power of transforming themselves into owls. They pursue and kill some of their own neighbors, but are finally caught and killed in revenge. Seven short items (142, 145, 153-157) are re- lated as actual occurrences: the person to whom they happened was someone known to the in- formant or to the informant's grandmother. They are short, strange occurrences, and the titles give adequate clues to the type of incident related. For instance, "A Love Medicine Tragedy" tells how a love potion deranged the mind of a young woman to such an extent that she killed her husband and became completely insane herself. "Onats Driven Away" tells of a man who had no fear of the mon- ster called Onats, or Legs, and when he heard that such a creature had been seen in a certain place he went there. He heard something chasing him and ran, but by morning whatever it was seemed to be weakening, and by daylight all that could be found was a large turtle.</page></plain_text>
