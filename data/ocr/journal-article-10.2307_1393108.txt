(Calvino, 1993, p. 178) ABSTRACT This paper presents a critique of 'voice discourse' in the sociology of education (and beyond). The discourse of 'voice' is identfied with a position that has recurred periodically since the early 1970s, which reduces knowledge to experience in order to de-legitimise rational, epistemologically grounded knowledge forms and truth claims that are represented as expressing no more than the "standpoints' and 'interests' of 'dominant' social groups. Today, this position is represented in a variety of postmodernist approaches and earlier in phenomenologically inspired approaches associated with the New Sociology of Education. The paper argues that these reductionist, relativistic and perspectival approaches rely upon a simplistic and positivistic caricature of science that appears unaware of sign/ficant debates in 'post-empiricist' philosophy of science. Their position is untenable and has been shown to be so for a long time. It is suggested that 'voice' discourse requires to be accounted for sociologically as a position-taking strategy within the intellectual field rather than accepted as a theoretically sustainable approach. Recent work by Basil Bernstein is drawn upon in order to produce a structural description of this position. Introduction Our purpose in this paper is to raise some issues about epistemological debates and approaches to knowledge in the sociology of education. Our starting point is the observation that since the phenomenologically inspired New Sociology of Education in the early 1970s to postmodernism today, approaches that question epistemological claims about the objectivity of knowledge (and the status of science, reason and rationality, more generally) have occupied an influential position in the field. In earlier times, this approach was often referred to as the 'sociology of knowledge' perspective. Yet then, as now, it is precisely the idea of knowledge that is being challenged. Such approaches adopt, ISSN 0142-5692 (print)/ISSN 1465-3346 (online)/99/020189-18 @ 1999 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd</page><page sequence="2">190 R. Moore &amp; J. Muller or at least favour or imply, a form of perspectivism which sees knowledge and truth claims as being relative to a culture, form of life or standpoint and, therefore, ultimately representing a particular perspective and social interest rather than independent, univer- salistic criteria. They complete this reduction by translating knowledge claims into statements about knowers. Knowledge is dissolved into knowing and priority is given to experience as specialised by category membership and identity (Maton, 1998). For instance, a so-called 'dominant' or 'hegemonic' form of knowledge, represented in the school curriculum, is identified as 'bourgeois', 'male', or 'white'-as reflecting the perspectives, standpoints and interests of dominant social groups. Today, the most common form of this approach is that which, drawing upon postmodernist and poststructuralist perspectives, adopts a discursive concern with the explication of 'voice'. Its major distinction is that between the dominant voice and those ('Others') silenced or marginalised by its hegemony. As Philip Wexler (1997, p.9) has recently observed: 'The postmodern emphasis on discourse and identity remain over- whelmingly the dominant paradigm in school research, and with few exceptions, gives few signs of abating' (see also Delamont, 1997). The main move is to attach knowledge to categories of knowers and to their experience and subjectivities. This privileges and specialises the subject in terms of its membership category as a subordinated voice. Knowledge forms and knowledge relations are translated as social standpoints and power relationships between groups. This is more a sociology of knowers and their relationships than of knowledge. What we will term 'voice discourse' is our principle concern, here. Historically, this approach has also been associated with concerns to reform pedagogy in a progressive direction. At the time of the New Sociology of Education in the early 1970s, this move was expressed in the debate between 'new' sociologists such as Michael Young (1971, 1976) and the philosophical position associated with R.S. Peters and Paul Hirst. More recently, it has been associated with developments such as anti-sexist, multicultural and postcolonial education, and with postmodernist critiques of the 'En- lightenment Project' and 'grand narratives'. The crucial issue, for such approaches, is that where social differentiation in education and the reproduction of social inequalities are associated with principles of exclusion structured in and through educational knowledge. Hence, the critique of knowledge and promotion of progressive pedagogy is understood as facilitating a move from social and educational exclusion to inclusion and the promotion of social justice. This history can be summarised as follows: in the early 1970s, the New Sociology of Education produced a critique of insulated knowledge codes by adopting a 'sociology of knowledge' perspective that claimed to demystify their epistemological pretensions to cognitive superiority by revealing their class base and form. Knowledge relations were transcribed as class relations [1]. In the late 1970s, feminism challenged the masculinist bias of class analysis and turned attention to the gendered character of educational relations, rewriting knowledge relations in terms of patriarchy. This was in turn followed by a focus upon race. In the 1980s, the primary categories employed by gender and race approaches fragmented as various groups contested the vanguardist claims of the earlier proponents of those perspectives to be representing the interests of women or blacks in general. The category 'woman', for instance, fragmented into groups such as women of colour, non-heterosexual women, working-class women, third-world women and African women (Wolpe, 1998). These fractions of gender and race were further extended by a range of sexualities and, to some degree (although never so successfully), by disabilities. Under this pressure of fragmentation, there was a rapid shift away from political universalism to a thoroughgoing celebration of difference and diversity; of decentred,</page><page sequence="3">Voice Discourse 191 hyphenated or iterative models of the self and, consequently, of identity politics. This poststructuralist celebration of diversity is associated with proclamations of inclusiveness that oppose the alleged exclusiveness of the dominant knowledge form that is revealed when its traditional claims to universalism and objectivity are shown for what they really are-the disguised standpoints and interests of dominant groups. On this basis, epistemology and the sociology of knowledge are presented as antithet- ical. The sociology of knowledge undertakes to demystify epistemological knowledge claims by revealing their social base and standpoint. At root, this sociology of knowledge debunks epistemology. The advocacy of progressive moral and political arguments becomes conflated with a particular set of (anti-) epistemological arguments (Siegel, 1995; Maton, 1999). At this descriptive level, these developments are usually presented as marking a progressive advance whereby the assault upon the epistemological claims of the domi- nant or 'hegemonic' knowledge code (rewritten in its social form as 'power') enables a succession of previously marginalised, excluded and oppressed groups to enter the central stage, their histories to be recovered and their 'voices' joined freely and equally with those already there [2]. Within this advance, the voice of reason (revealed as that of the ruling class white heterosexual male) is reduced simply to one among many, of no special distinction. This is advance through the multiplication of categories and their differences. Disparities of access and representation in education were (and are) rightly seen as issues that need addressing and remedying, and in this respect constitute a genuine politics. It is important to stress, here, that the issues are real issues and the work done on their behalf is real work. But the question is: is this politics best pursued in this way? The tendency we are intending to critique, then, assumes an internal relation between: (a) theories of knowledge (epistemological or sociological); (b) forms of education (traditional or progressive); and (c) social relations (between dominant and subordinated groups). This establishes the political default settings whereby epistemologically grounded, knowl- edge-based forms of education are politically conservative, while 'integrated' (Bernstein, 1977) or 'hybrid' (Muller &amp; Taylor, 1995) knowledge codes are progressive. On this basis, socially progressive causes are systematically detached from epistemologically powerful knowledge structures and from their procedures for generating and promoting truths of fact and value. For us, the crucial problem, here, is that these default settings have the effect of undermining the very argumentative force that progressive causes in fact require in order to press their claims. The position of voice discourse and its cognate forms within the sociology of education has, also, profoundly affected theory and research within the field, with little attention being paid to structural level concerns with social stratification and a penchant for small-scale, qualitative ethnographic methods and 'culturalist' concerns with discursive positioning and identity (Moore, 1996a; Hatcher, 1998). We will argue that this perspective is not only politically self-defeating, but also intellectually incoherent-that, in fact, progressive claims implicitly presuppose precisely the kind of 'conservative' epistemology that they tend to reject and that, to be of value, the sociology of education should produce knowledge in the strong sense. This is important because the effects of the (anti-) epistemological thesis undermine the possibilities of producing precisely that kind of knowledge required to support the moral/political objectives. Indeed, the dubious epistemological assumptions may lead not only to an 'analytical nihilism that is contrary to (their) political project' (Ladwig, 1995, p.222), but also to pedagogic conclusions that</page><page sequence="4">192 R. Moore &amp; J. Muller are actively counterproductive and ultimately work against the educational interests of precisely those groups they are meant to help (Stone, 1981; Dowling, 1994). We agree, thus, with Siegel that, '... it is imperative that defenders of radical pedagogy distinguish their embrace of particular moral/political theses from untenable, allegedly related, epistemological ones' (ibid., p.34). Episodic Return It is not our purpose, however, to simply argue against 'voice discourse'. We have drawn attention to the way in which this position has assumed a number of forms over a fairly long period of time and it is also, of course, widespread in the social sciences and humanities (in literary studies and criticism, in particular). For reasons we give and develop in depth later, we see these facts as requiring attention in themselves. That 'voice discourse' has both endured in this fashion and is so widespread calls for explanation because, as an intellectual position, it lacks any sustainable credibility, and this has been the case for a long time! Hence, we will suggest that the issues, here, are not simply those of argument and critique, but of the structuring of the intellectual field. In this respect, 'voice discourse' must be described and understood as a position within the field. Its influence is difficult to explain intellectually because as an argument it is long discredited, but perhaps it can be accounted for sociologically. Our reasons for adopting this approach to the position currently occupied by voice discourse are as follows: "* First, the refutations of the relativistic perspectivism of voice discourse are already well established and have been so for a long time (Harr6 &amp; Krausz, 1996). In part, they were developed within the philosophy of science in the debates that arose in response to Kuhn's (1970) The Structure of Scientfic Revolutions, and the issue of incommensurabil- ity, but can be found also, for instance, in debates over meaning and interpretation in radical ethnography [3]. It is probably fair to say that these arguments are so well established and convincing that perspectivism has no serious (or, at least, no seriously unqualified) support in those places where the issues have been debated longest and most rigorously. Hence, it is noteworthy that the position maintains such a strong allegiance within areas of the sociology of education (and elsewhere). It may reveal something about the strongly insulated position of the field that, in the insularity of its debates, it so often seems so indifferent to, or unaware of, developments elsewhere. In what kinds of 'places' is this discourse lodged? "* Second, given the centrality of science to these issues and to the way in which voice discourse defines itself andtestablishes its credentials through a critique of science and scientific rationality, the neglect of the past 30 years of debate in post-empiricist philosophy of science (see later) can be seen as a positioning strategy rather than counting as an intellectually viable position. Symptomatic of this is the tendency for 'science' in this literature to be conflated with positivism and identified with absolutism rather than fallibilism (see also Hammersley &amp; Gomm, 1997). As we shall argue, the force of the postmodern critique depends precisely upon restricting 'science' to this positivist and absolutist caricature. * Third, further evidence that we are dealing with a field position or position-taking strategy is in the peculiar tendency for it to repeat itself in different forms over an extended period of time, from the phenomenology of the New Sociology of Education in the early 1970s [4] to today's post-structuralism and the uses made of Foucault and</page><page sequence="5">Voice Discourse 193 Derrida, as well as of postmodernists such as Lyotard. Upon inspection, positions that are theoretically very different or even antithetical (phenomenological, structuralist, post-structuralist) are used in the same way at different times. Placed in context, the discourse of voice appears as the repetition of a particular kind of intellectual episode which tends to recur, in ostensibly different forms, over the years (Moore, 1996b). It represents a move to decentre or delegitimise what is held to be a dominant or hegemonic knowledge form and to promote some alternative linked with the standpoint and interests of an allegedly marginalised or silenced group. We suggest that this episodic event must be understood sociologically in terms of the structuring of the intellectual field rather than intellectually in terms of its argument, or in terms of its moral or political stance. Hence, our critique of voice discourse will not only rehearse the arguments against, it but also attempt to describe it. Issues and Positions Durkheim argued that everything must be described twice: first in its own terms as a 'practical' theory, then, again, in its social form. This distinction has been significantly refined and systematically developed by Bernstein in his discussion of discourses, knowledge structures and fields (1996, Chapter 9). He makes a contrast between horizontal and vertical discourses, and knowledge structures, and we will argue that the discourse of voice has operated in the form of a 'horizontal' knowledge structure with a particularly weak grammar, and the process we have described can be understood as the reproduction (through replication) of such a knowledge structure over time. It is useful to make a distinction here between 'issues' and 'positions'. The progressive description is at the level of issues-the issue of the working class, the woman issue, the black issue, and so on. The issue, in each case, is different because the 'identity is different. But from a sociological point of view, the position is the same. At the level of the issues, the rhetoric changes in each case, but their logics have a common and constant form-that of contesting a dominant knowledge claim by differentiating a subordinated category, and constructing its distinctive identity and interest by way of authorising its own voice and authenticity of experience as knowledge (Delamont, 1997). Hence, each instance (issue) can be rewritten in a common paradigmatic form (Moore, 1996b). Our concern is to explore that form and explicate its structure-to rewrite the issue as the position. Voice discourses identify a constituency or membership category and present them- selves as the representation (representative) of that constituency, as its voice-the voice of 'woman', for example. We could say that this is a kind of anthropomorphism (in the generic rather than the gendered sense) which turns knowledge forms into 'characters' [5]. The realm of knowledge is re-presented as a cast of characters engaged in a drama of competing, antagonistic interests and struggles. Following Gellner (1974), the device can be seen as transforming the 'cold' world of secular rationalism in which knowledge is divorced from knowers (what Popper (1983) called 'epistemology without a knowing subject'), back into a 'warm' world of human characters. Whereas critical rationalism as an historically radical force systematically attempted to separate knower claims from knowledge claims (things are not true simply because the Chief, the Party or the Pope says so), this device sets out, once more, to privilege the knower, or the knower's imputed membership category, as the truth criterion. Perversely, post-modernism pursues a 'pre-modern' strategy of attempting to reinstate 'who knows' as the authority for 'what</page><page sequence="6">194 R. Moore &amp; J. Muller is known'. The fact that it celebrates the virtue of the oppressed against the calumny of the oppressor does not change the principle. As the the phonocentrism (Derrida, 1976) of the term 'voice' implies, this discourse warrants itself through assertions of naturalistic authenticity. It counters 'hegemonic' epistemological knowledge claims with representations of the experience of exclusion attributed to those silenced by its dominance: it asserts the primacy of speech (experience) over writing (theory)-of the mundane over the esoteric or, in the terminology of Durkheim's (1915) pathbreaking analysis in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, the profane over the sacred [6]. However, and crucially, 'voices' imply hearers as well as speakers. The key question to be asked whenever we encounter the notion of 'voice', is not only who is speaking, but who is hearing-or, more accurately, reading? Voices have to be read backwards. To say this is not inadvertently to mix metaphors; in reality, we only ever encounter 'voices' in texts. Voices are textual productions-or, to be precise, recontextualisations (Bernstein, 1990). The rhetoric of voice discourse disguises the fact that 'voice' is entirely a product of texts (writing/theory) and is constituted by the principles whereby the text is written. The rhetoric that re-presents text as 'voice' suppresses precisely the syntax that generates the text and displaces its principle to the imaginary place occupied by the imaginary subject whose voice is invoked as author/authority. It is by reading 'voice' backwards (from 'speaker' to 'hearer') that we may be able to recover the specialised pedagogic device which, through constructing the 'imaginary subject' (Bernstein, 1990) of voice (the 'speaker'), specialises and privileges the field position of the 'hearer' within the structuring of the field. Every description of reality, every theoretical tendency, depicts the world in such a way that a certain community of members will recognise the description of the world as the world 'as it really is'. The question we now wish to address is: how does the discourse of voice constitute its description of the world? To answer the question requires determining the standpoint of that description as well as its positioning strategy--i.e. determining how the standpoint is positively constructed (from where is the description made?) and, correlatively, in relation to what is it negatively characterised (against what is its distinctiveness constructed?). Science and the Construction of the Dominant Discourse We will begin by considering the negative construction, i.e. the way in which this discourse represents itself and defines its distinctiveness in opposition to a position defined as dominant or hegemonic, and in relation to which it or those whose 'voices' it represents is marginalised or, hitherto, silenced. Discourses of voice all have the following as features of their positioning strategy: "* a description of the world from a standpoint that sees itself as subordinated; "* the standpoint of the voice is established by means of a critique of the dominant knowledge-form seen to be central to the construction of subordination. A description of the world in terms of social relations of domination/subordination is transcribed as an epistemic relation that is then treated as the constitutive principle of the social relation. For example, women are subordinated to men because the dominant forms of knowledge are male ('male' reason, 'male' science, 'male' history, etc.). As Siegel (1997), has demonstrated, it is in the slide from the social/moral to the epistemic that this perspective not only becomes questionable, but also fatally under- mines the moral and political grounds that inspire it in the first place. Inclusion, for</page><page sequence="7">Voice Discourse 195 instance, may be a morally defensible social virtue but inclusiveness is not intrinsically an epistemic virtue: first, because there is no necessary relationship between inclusiveness and truth or exclusiveness and falsehood; and second, because epistemological inclusiveness ('anything goes') removes any effective basis for arguing for social inclusiveness because all arguments, including those against inclusion, are equally valid-dependent on the perspective of the belief holders (see Siegel, ibid., Chapter 12) [7]. It is through the negative construction that this position claims its radical distinctiveness. Furthermore, its major positive contentions, including its claims to originality, depend upon the viability of the way in which it constructs the dominant discourse to which it is opposed both morally and epistemologically. We will begin by examining one current exemplar of the discourse of voice in education, that of Usher &amp; Edwards (1994), and distil from it the discursive rules that typically re-occur across the range of positions within this field. The basic move is, as we have said, one that translates knowledge relations into social relations through a reductive critique of epistemology. The main argument purports to demolish the claims of the dominant form of knowledge. In this case, the issue we examine is the manner in which science is presented and how that presentation delegitimises the epistemological claims made for science and, in so doing, opens the space for other 'voices'. In their discussion of Lyotard, Usher &amp; Edwards (1994) identify 'a number of familiar strands of the postmodern moment' (p. 158), as it established itself against a sitting-duck version of modernism: ...first, the significance of the emergence of modern science with its empiricist epistemology and views of language as transparent and representational; second, the privileging of scientific knowledge over other forms of knowledge; third, given the privileged status of such knowledge, the importance, indeed the necessity, of imparting it to others-in other words, the centrality of education to modern science, as a condition for its ascendancy and an outcome of it; fourth, the oppressive consequences of those assumptions, in that the totalising of knowledge results in totalitarianism, the exclusion and silencing of difference. (Usher &amp; Edwards, 1994, p. 158) This account succinctly displays both the central theses of the negative voice position and its cognates, and the crucial slippage between moral/political and epistemic arguments. First, 'modern science' is characterised exclusively in positivist terms and its massive social hegemony assumed but nowhere demonstrated [8]. Second, this positivist charac- terisation of 'modern science' is then further characterised as 'totaliterian' and held accountable for 'the exclusion and silencing of difference'. On this basis, sets of (defensible and desirable) moral/political claims relating to social justice and equality of treatment and respect are conflated with a set of (indefensible and undesirable) epistemic theses (Siegel, 1997, p. 142). To put our position plainly and provocatively; this position is: (a) misleading in its depiction of 'modern science' (see later); (b) mistaken in its sociological view of the 'hegemonic' and 'totalising' position of this epistemology within modern society; (c) mistaken in its depiction of the position and status of such knowledge within education systems (particularly in the English case); and consequently, (d) mistaken in its conclusions about its social consequences for the silencing and exclusion of subordinated groups.</page><page sequence="8">196 R. Moore &amp; J. Muller On the final point, we must be very clear. We are not denying the facts of marginalisa- tion, exclusion and oppression; nor are we trivialising those conditions. Like Siegel, we support the progressive moral/political values and objectives but sociologically, we reject this idealist account of the causes of such material conditions and, philosophically, we reject its anti-intellectual implications. Modern Science We will now address in more depth the key issue of the characterisation of 'modern science'. Usher and Edwards tell us that the 'dominant discourse of science ... places science firmly outside of any context of social locatedness arguing that its knowledge is warranted precisely because it is outside' (1994, pp. 33-34). The ascendancy of scientific method as the means of establishing secure knowledge has resulted in a consistent failure to examine science as a social practice and as a historical and cultural product. Science has instead been seen as transcendent and decontextualised. Knowledge, as well as the knowing subject, therefore becomes context-free. Rationality is cast as universal and transcendental, operating across all historical and social contexts and practices but independent of them all. The result is an individualistic epistemology where the solitary individual confronts an independent reality of objects. (Usher &amp; Edwards, 1994, p. 36) This account of science is representative of postmodernism, encountered within some feminisms (but not all; see, for example, Scott (1994) and, earlier, expressed in the anti-positivist interpretative sociological literature of the late 1960s and early 1970s which provided the context for NSOE. An awkward problem with this type of description of the 'dominant discourse of science' arises immediately-it bears no significant relationship to any recognisable discourse of science today, in the recent past or even (with one exception) in the past century! It corresponds roughly only to logical positivism (see Bohman, 1991, Chapter 1). Even in relation to the empiricist tradition, the designation of 'dominant' ignores the massive counter influence of post-Kantian epistemology and its historicisation from Schopenhauer through Hegel and Marx to Durkheim. Far from being dominant, this model of science is a very specific moment within empiricism and the modern empiricist tradition, itself a specifically anglo-saxon 'analytic' response to Kant (see West, 1996). What authorities do Usher and Edwards invoke to support their view? They refer in the main only to other postmodernist writers (Lyotard for instance) and hermeneutic precursors such as Gadamer [9]. There is a passing reference to Kuhn, but he, of course, has vigorously rejected the idea that his work should be treated as relativist or irrationalist (Kuhn, 1970). For most students of the philosophy of science, Popper put an end to positivism proper a long time ago, yet strangely, its image has been kept alive within a particular discourse in sociology as a kind of clanking modernist machine within the hermeneutic ghost of interpretative idealism. A number of commentators have noted this characteristic 'strawman' tactic by postmodernists (for example, Norris, 1997a,b), and its persistence and prevalence within this field over such a long time suggests that it should be seen as a discursive device, to be understood in terms of what it does rather than what it says. What it says, we contend, simply does not bear serious scrutiny. It is not just the case that no serious scientists today would argue that science does have the form attributed to it by the postmodernists (see, for example, the scientists</page><page sequence="9">Voice Discourse 197 contributing to 'Special Section: making sense of science' in History of the Human Sciences, 8(2), 1995), but that the central debates emphatically begin with the recognition that science is 'inside' history and is socially constructed (see Hammersley, 1995). The dominant discourse of science does not question its historical and social character, rather the issues are to do with the implications of this widely accepted fact. It is not possible to review in detail the development of debates in the 'post-empiricist philosophy of science', nor is it our main aim here, but it is relevant to the context of the argument to draw attention to the 'naturalised' philosophy of science represented by epistemological realists such as Boyd and Laudan (Papineau, 1996). Papineau refers to the 'explosion of exciting work in the sociology of science' (p. 16). He goes on to say that, This kind of sociology has been widely regarded as undermining any epistemo- logical analysis of science, on the grounds that epistemology deals in a priori standards of rationality, while sociological studies seem to show that scientific theory choices aren't governed in this way at all, but rather by scientific power struggles and opportunistic manoeuvres. This rejection of epistemology presup- poses, however, that epistemology traffics solely in a priori principles of theory evaluation. By contrast, if epistemology of science is conducted in the natural- istic mode, then the conflict disappears. Naturalised philosophers of science have no axe to grind for a priori principles over social processes. They can happily accept that social processes often determine theory choices. The only normative question they will want to ask is whether those processes are an effective means to scientific aims. Nor is this a question they can answer for themselves. For it is an empirical question, not an a priori one, and the philosophers will therefore need the help of sociologists and historians of science in order to answer it. (Papineau, 1996) The currently 'dominant' discourse of science not only bears no relationship to the postmodernist strawman, but the naturalisation of epistemology by philosophers of science such as Popper, Hanson, Hesse, Harre and others precedes the 'postmodernist revolution' by several decades. Contrary to Usher and Edwards' view that 'Relativism is feared precisely because in claiming that there is no uniquely privileged position from which to know but a number of different positions each with their own standards, the very possibility of an authorising centre is apparently destroyed' (1994, p. 37), relativism is not feared at all, but simply dismissed because its claims have no serious status (Harre' &amp; Krausz, 1996; Fay, 1996). In addition to Papineau's comments about the convergence between philosophy and sociology of science, we can note also the increasingly powerful syntheses being produced by critical realist philosophers and social theorists such as Roy Bhaskar (1979) and Margaret Archer (1990, 1995). We, ourselves, would add the observation that the 'internalist' versus 'externalist' split in accounts of science can, from this point of view, be seen as fundamentally misconceived, in the sense that 'externalists' have tended to treat internalist reconstructions of the logic of science as equivalent to ethnographic descriptions of the social practice of science. We suggest that it might be more productive to see internalist models as explications of the 'rules' of science rather than descriptions of its social practice. In this way, we would no more expect practice to immediately exhibit a well-informed 'rule' than we would expect speech to transparently reveal language. The significant point, here, is that no amount of 'thick' description can in itself supersede, negate or disallow theoretical excavations of the rules of practice understood</page><page sequence="10">198 R. Moore &amp; J. Muller as their generative principles and condition of existence. The strong sociological version of the critique of formalist versions of internalism was certainly correct in criticising positivism on the grounds that its requirement of a theory-neutral pure observation language mirroring sense-data (as in Russell or the early Wittgenstein) was simply not possible and, furthermore, as Popper argued (and Durkheim before him), nothing like science anyway. But it is wrong to assume from the inevitable indeterminacies of science as a social practice that no formal epistemological account of science is possible. Although it is true that all social practices have an endemic degree of indeterminacy and, in this respect, science is like any other social practice, it does not follow that all social practices, including science, are therefore symmetrical and that there are no formal demarcation criteria between kinds of practices and discourses. Such a conclusion would follow only if a particular absolutist condition (disallowing indeterminacy in principle) is insisted upon in the definition of what is to count as science and reason more generally. It is precisely this condition that some postmodernists impose and is represented in Usher and Edwards' account. If science, or rationality more generally, cannot be absolute, then, according to this view, it cannot be at all. However, as James Bohman says, 'Even if interpretation is unavoidably indeterminate, it follows only that there is no unique best interpretation, not that there is no way to distinguish better from worse interpretations' (1991, p. 10; our emphasis). It is just such an 'all or nothing' argument that post-empiricist epistemology and philosophy of science has abandoned and, furthermore, did so from within its own tradition and within its mainstream critical discourse. The sceptical and relativist conclusions of postmodernism regarding the possibilities of knowledge (or feminist moves to present this knowledge as in some intrinsic sense 'androcentric', or by multiculturalists as 'ethnocentric') follow only from the attribution of absolutist criteria to science and reason. The sociologising of knowledge relations in a form that reduces them to no more than standpoints articulated within power relations holds only for as long as the 'all or nothing' principle holds. Post-empiricism, on the other hand, supersedes this opposition by demonstrating that there is no in-principle conflict between epistemology and sociology-that epistemology, to the degree that it must present an historically viable account of science, must be sociological; but sociology, to the extent that it must provide a viable account of science within history, must accommodate a naturalised epistemology that provides not 'the unique best interpret- ation', but addresses how we come to distinguish and institutionalise what Luntley (1995) calls the 'simple truth', which involves the recognition that some explanations are indubitably better than, or at least formally different from, others. As Gellner, Harre, Popper, Kuhn and others, in their various ways, have recognised, the epistemological problem is an historical problem (classically, that of Weber). Although it is true that we do not know or agree about exactly how it is that some explanations are better than others or how we know this, the one thing we know beyond serious doubt is that all explanations are not equal. Whereas those fields centrally concerned with the problems of knowledge (epistemology, the philosophies of science and knowledge) have long recognised the need for sociology, it is a peculiar fact that key areas within sociology and the sociology of education in particular have systematically refused the converse-to acknowledge that a sociology of knowledge which cannot accommodate post-empiricist epistemology is, as Gellner (1992) rightly insisted, little more than intellectual affectation. It is ironic that the postmodernists, and those now sheltering under their wings, are the only ones left with any interest in positivism. Their account holds only for as long as positivism stands. In this sense, positivism is their secret 'Other'-the orthodoxy that is the condition for their heterodoxy. It is, then, not surprising that they do so much to</page><page sequence="11">Voice Discourse 199 to sustain it in their various accounts of the 'dominant discourse'. What is surprising, and sociologically significant, is that there should be an intellectual field doing this when nowhere else is positivism of anything other than passing historical interest. This is more serious than it sounds. As Bohman (1991) has observed, '... post-empiricism has removed the social sciences from their contentious and peripheral status and placed them directly in the centre of some new epistemological debates' (p.3). At the very moment that post-empiricist epistemology draws sociology into the centre, the position- taking logic of the field of sociology of education propels it, yet again, towards an intellectually and politically bankrupt 'sociology of knowledge', covertly grounded in assumptions and overtly in practices that can only maintain it at the periphery of serious debate. What Kind of Thing: voice discourse as pedagogic device In this section, we will characterise voice discourse in terms of what it does positively in terms of its basic discursive procedures. We will attempt to demonstrate how the intellectual moves within the argument of voice discourse operate as discursive position- ing devices revalorising the social relations between groups. The reduction of knowledge to the single plane of experience through the rejection of 'depth analysis' and its epistemology (that allows for and requires a separate and autonomous non-mundane language of theory) produces differences of identity alone, but differences that are, in essence, all the same. The postmodern proclamation that there is only 'surface' echoes the earlier phenomenological claim that science is simply another species of common- sense-an everyday accomplishment of members of the science community or form of life. The pedagogic device (Bernstein, 1990) of voice discourse promotes a methodology in which the explication of a method's social location precludes the need to examine the content of its data as grounds for valid explanation. Who says it is what counts, not what is said. This approach favours an ethnography that claims to reveal the cultural specificity of the category--the 'voice' of membership. What is held to be the facts, to be the case, is only so-and can only be so-from a particular perspective. The world thus viewed is a patchwork of incommensurable and exclusive voices or standpoints. Through the process of sub-division, increasingly more particularised identity categories come into being, each claiming the unique specificity of its distinctive experience and the knowledge authorised by it. The consequence of the abolition of the knowledge boundary that follows from the epistemological theses of postmodernism is the increasing specialisation of social cate- gories (see Maton, 1998). Maton describes this process of proliferation in terms of the way such 'knower' discourses, ... base their legitimation upon the privileged insight of a knower, and work at maintaining strong boundaries around their definition of this knower-they celebrate difference where 'truth' is defined by the 'knower' or 'voice'. As each voice is brought into the choir, the category of the privileged 'knower' becomes smaller, each strongly bounded from one another, for each 'voice' has its own privileged and specialised knowledge. The client 'knower' group thus frag- ments, each fragment with its own representative ... The procession of the excluded thus becomes, in terms of the privileged 'knower', an accretion of adjectives, the 'hyphenation' which knower modes often proclaim as progress.</page><page sequence="12">200 R. Moore &amp; J. Muller In summary, with the emergence of each new category of knower, the categories of knowers become smaller, leading to proliferation and fragmen- tation within the knowledge formation. (ibid., p. 17) As Maton argues, this move promotes a fundamental change in the principle of legitimation-from what is known (and how) to who knows it. The device that welds knowledge to standpoint, voice and experience, produces a result that is inherently unstable, because the anchor for the voice is an interior authenticity that can never be demonstrated, only claimed (Taylor, 1992; Siegel, 1997; Fuss, 1990, 1995). Since all such claims are power claims, the authenticity of the voice is constantly prone to a purifying challenge, 'If you do not believe it you are not one of us' (Hammersly &amp; Gomm, 1997, para. 3.3) that gears down to ever more rarefied specialisations or iterations of the voice category; an unstoppable spiral that Bernstein (1997, p. 176) has referred to as the 'shrinking of the moral imagination [10]. As Bernstein puts it, 'The voice of a social category (academic discourse, gender subject, occupational subject) is constructed by the degree of specialisation of the discursive rules regulating and legitimising the form of communication' (1990, p.23). If categories of either agents or discourse are specialised, then each category necessarily has its own specific identity and its own specific boundaries. The speciality of each category is created, maintained and reproduced only if the relations between the categories of which a given category is a member are preserved. What is to be preserved? The insulation between the categories. It is the strength of the insulation that creates a space in which a category can become specific. If a category wishes to increase its specificity, it has to appropriate the means to produce the necessary insulation that is the prior condition to its appropriating specificity. (ibid.) Collection codes employ an organisation of knowledge to specialise categories of person, integrated codes employ an organisation of persons to specialise categories of knowledge (Bernstein, 1977, pp. 106-111). The instability of the social categories associated with voice discourse reflects the fact that there is no stable and agreed-upon way of constructing such categories. By their nature, they are always open to contestation and further fragmentation. In principle, there is no terminal point where 'identities' can finally come to rest. It is for this reason that this position can reappear so frequently across time and space within the intellectual field-the same move can be repeated endlessly under the disguise of 'difference'. In Bernstein's terms, the organisation of knowledge is, most significantly, a device for the regulation of consciousness. The pedagogic device is thus a symbolic ruler of consciousness in its selective creation, positioning and oppositioning of pedagogic subjects. It is the con- dition for the production, reproduction, and transformation of culture. The question is: whose ruler, what consciousness? (1990, p. 189) The relativistic challenge to epistemologically grounded strong classifications of knowl- edge removes the means whereby social categories and their relations can be strongly theorised and effectively researched in a form that is other than arbitrary and can be challenged by anyone choosing to assert an alternative perspective or standpoint.</page><page sequence="13">Voice Discourse 201 Languages of Theory and Experience Horizontal knowledge structures (Bernstein, 1996) of the voice sociology kind lack the procedures (theoretical language or syntax) for generating non-arbitrary knowledge claims (see also Muller &amp; Taylor, 1995). They all speak of the same thing: experience. They are all equally perspectively privileged. Whether we look at the literature of standpoint epistemology (Hartsock, 1990; Harding, 1991), new literacy studies (Street, 1984), or ethno and constructivist pedagogies (see Olssen, 1997), among many others, what binds them together across their multiple differences is the firm belief that discourses, knowledge, all symbolic forms, because they participate in a world where all humans ought to be equal, are all fundamentally the same, on the same epistemological footing, of the same type and structure. Experiences are differentiated only in terms of their authenticity as expressions of their own subjecthood. In a world of difference, as Gayatri Spivak (1990) says, 'the place where indeed all human beings are similar-is seen to be lodged in their being different' (p. 228). In a constructed world, where constructors are all equal because all are equally human, constructions must be fundamentally of a kind. Demonstrating the equal validity, or fundamental worthiness, of lay, local, and non-official forms of discourse is a major scholarly aim for many relativists on the grounds that because all people are equal, so is their knowledge. It is also a strategy of struggle that many local communities, taking their cue from the professional educators, have adopted as their own (Singh, 1998). Crucially, such a theory of structural equality of discourse forms denies the discontinu- ity of epistemological break, of a distinction between metaphor and concept, of the necessity for a retreat from practical utility in order to address the unthought and to effect a conceptual advance (Bernstein, 1996, Chapter 4). It promotes one kind of superficial difference at the expense of another that is fundamental. The difference it promotes is that of (tacitly constructed) membership as the means of defining experience and knowledge. As we pointed out, this position is inherently unstable because categories and associated authenticity claims are always open to challenge, expressed in the process of fragmentation that accompanies the iteration of identities and division of categories. Post-structuralism, as an emerging orthodoxy in the humanities, reflects this instability, but redresses the problem by re-presenting it as a virtue in the celebration of 'difference'. Each new 'voice' is celebrated as another emancipation. What this celebration of difference disguises, and this is the basic source of the instability, is the actual theoretical dualism that these approaches deny. The position is thus grounded in a contradiction that denies the condition of its own existence. All accounts have, first, to theoretically construct the world they go on to describe in various ways and, in principle, be able to demonstrate non-tautologically (Bernstein, 1996, Chapters 6 and 9) that the world is in fact as such. What voice discourses suppress is the manner in which they covertly exempt themselves from the condition they prescribe and hold to be true for everyone else. This exemption is always a form of the basic contradiction of relativism. The truth that all truths are relative must exempt itself in order to be true; there is one truth that is not relative: the truth that all truth is relative. But then, of course, it is not true that all truth is relative. Positions that deny that anything can be 'in fact' the case (because what is the case is only ever so from a particular perspective) implicitly suppress the claim that it is in fact the case that the world is thus and, furthermore, can be shown to be so. In fact, we know full well that it is not! The exemption that these discourses covertly claim is precisely the principle that they overtly deny--that there are, in fact, ways of warranting truth claims that are not</page><page sequence="14">202 R. Moore &amp;J. Muller merely reducible to perspectives, standpoints, and forms of life (Hammersley &amp; Gomm, 1997, para. 3.7). The condition, for instance, for establishing that knowledge may be, in some sense, degree or form, gendered is that there are some procedures and criteria that, in themselves, are not. It is not just that the world is not as the relativists claim-their world is an impossible one. In these terms, what we are calling discourses of voice are those lacking a strong internal language of description. Their internal language does produce a world of objects and relationships, but its process of production lacks a stable, explicit and rigorous methodology of production (as is the case for what Bernstein terms 'hierarchical knowledge structures' exemplified by physics (1996, Chapter 9)). For instance, feminism has the theoretical problem of defining the categories 'male' and 'female' independently of their various presumed realisations. Hence, although it is common to come across terms such as 'male epistemology' or even 'male conferencing', it is much rarer to encounter an instance of 'male' being defined independently in such a way that it can then become a methodological issue as to whether any particular case is in fact a realisation of 'maleness' rather than some other thing (Pollert, 1996). It is important to stress that these discourses do not lack an internal language of description; their problem is that it exists only in a weak form, as 'orientations, condensed intimations, metaphors which point to relevancies' (Bernstein, 1996, p. 137). Bernstein's use of literary terms, here, is completely appropriate. These weak languages of descrip- tion can only produce accounts in which positions and relations are re-presented as characters and the drama of their relationships. Where experience replaces theory as the author of knowledge, the privileging of the mundane does not abolish theory; it systematically denies and obscures its own theoretical genesis. Conclusion We argued in the first section of this paper that the force of the position with which we are concerned crucially depends upon the manner in which it positions itself in opposition to the allegedly mainstream, dominant or hegemonic discourse. There are three basic points. Firstly, as we have argued, voice discourse operates primarily as a debunking strategy. It attempts to displace a set of 'dominant' knowledge claims by revealing those claims to be epistemologically spurious: the disguised interests and standpoint of the dominant group. It does this by representing that dominant discourse as positivistic and absolutist. By constructing the dominant discourse in this fashion, it has no problems in pressing its claims because, certainly, any position that did assert epistemological privilege by these means would fail. The problem is, no-one does. It is on the basis of this manoeuvre that voice discourse goes on to establish its positive (inclusive) attributes in terms of the representation of those voices previously silenced or marginalised by the hegemony of the dominant discourse. Secondly, the dominant position in science begins with and has long acknowledged precisely those things which postmodernists and others claim as their distinctive, original insights: that science, and reason more generally, is socially constructed, 'inside' history and inevitably enmeshed with the complex of interests present within the context of production. But the sceptical, reductionist and relativist conclusions drawn by postmod- ernists and others from these facts simply are not warranted, or are only warranted in terms of the positivistic model that they insist upon representing as 'science'. The central programme within post-empiricist philosophy of science has successfully defended episte-</page><page sequence="15">Voice Discourse 203 mology against the kind of relativising reductionism supported by postmodernists. Within the 'naturalised' philosophy of science, epistemology and the sociology of knowledge are complementary, not antagonistic. The dominant discourse of science sustains fallibilism but avoids scepticism-indeed, claims to certainty and absolutism in knowledge (typically presented by postmodernists and certain feminists as definitive of foundationalism or androcentrism) are generally treated as the symptoms of ideology and disallow claims to scientificity or reasonable justification. Thirdly, given that the present position in science is well known, well established and has been in place for so long, we suggest that the voice discourse position, in its various forms over the past two decades and more, has been sustained by a form of knowledge that is symptomatic of a strongly insulated field position supporting a particular position-taking strategy. Although these approaches make much of their self-acclaimed reflexivity, in fact it is just this quality that they lack (we are speaking here about the accounts not their agents). It is interesting to note how the use of ethnography is associated with a preoccupation with biography-the writers write themselves into their world, they stabilise their 'voice' at the expense of revealing its conditions of production. They suppress the procedures by which they specialise their own voice and, hence, by which they produce their own descriptions of the world. This displaced 'reflexivity', re-presented as a claim to authenticity, cannot reveal the principles whereby these authors produce the world within which they locate themselves (i.e. the internal language of description that constructs the world to be theorised) but, rather, re-presents it as the first person of the narrative of description. Although voices are claimed to be mundane (authored and authorised by the authenticity of the mundane (speech/experience)), they are, and can only ever be, esoteric because it is only within the esoteric (writing/theory) that the texts of voice can be produced. What voice discourse suppresses is its own esoteric origins as 'a recontextual- ising principle which selectively appropriates, relocates, refocuses, and relates other discourses to constitute its own order and orderings' (Bernstein, 1990)-the principle that first constructs the world it then goes on to describe. The 'voice' of voice discourse erases the text that writes the world of which it speaks.

NOTES [1] This tenet of the 'new sociology' was, in the event, soon successfully challenged. As Young (1998) himself says, 'The "new sociology of education", as a set of ideas ... was short-lived, partly on account of its own theoretical limitations' (ibid., p. 39), and further, 'The idea that knowledge is socially stratified in society and in schools ... is powerful--unless it is seen as a total description of the origins and structure of the curriculum, when it becomes naive and misleading' (ibid., p. 5).</page><page sequence="16">204 R. Moore &amp;J. Muller [2] This process roughly follows the social trajectory of educational expansion and the entry of 'non-standard' students into sites where they previously had only a limited representation (Hickox &amp; Moore, 1994, 1995). [3] See, for instance, Popper (1994, Chapter 2), and discussions in Fay (1996) and Bohman (1991). [4] Space does not allow us to substantiate this claim in detail, but we suggest that a relevant comparison can be made between this type of contemporary postmodernist account of science and that in the phenomenologically inspired .New Directions in Sociological Theogy by Filmer et al. (1972, Chapter 1). [5] Symptomatically, these approaches frequently draw upon literary forms such as narrative, biography and confession. [6] We cannot explore the seminal character of Durkheim's analysis here-see work in progress and Bernstein (1996, Chapter 4). [7] It would have to be established empirically in any particular case that the inclusiveness or exclusiveness of a particular knowledge community had either positive or negative epistemic effects. Although the social composition of a knowledge community might influence the kinds of things about which it develops knowledge, it would make no sense to say that it influences how true (or well-warranted) is the knowledge it produced. [8] It is relevant to call attention here to the fact that failure of the scientific worldview to assume an hegemonic position within modern society is the more remarkable. Contrary to the expectations of many nineteenth century thinkers, it is the persistence (and, in recent times, intensification) of religious, mystical and other kinds of 'irrational' belief that has been the most striking feature of the twentieth century (re the debates around secularisation, nationalism and 'the end of ideology'). We can also draw attention to the particular case of English culture where the dominance of the humanities and, in particular, the enduring influence of an anti-scientific romanticism within the national culture and its education system, has been a long-standing cause of concern among those who argue that Britain's industrial decline is a consequence of a failure to modernise around a science-based culture and economy (Mathieson &amp; Bernbaum, 1988) (see also the discussion of these and related issues in Beck (1998). The wider context and history of this debate is effectively reviewed by Hickox (1995). [9] For the influence of the nineteenth century Natur/Geisteswissenschaften distinction on the debate about the relationship between the natural and social science, see Boham (1991). It is essentially this distinction that informs the discussion in Filmer et al. (see footnote 4). [10] This phenomenon is already part of popular culture, and commented on in ironic terms: 'I'd heard this described as the narcissism of Minor Difference at a seminar on fashion retailing', says the cynical anti-hero of David Huggins' (1996) The Big Kiss.
