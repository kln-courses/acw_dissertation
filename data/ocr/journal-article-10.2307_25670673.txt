<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Instinct for Spiritual Quests: Quiet Religion JAY SCHULKIN Georgetown University John Dewey notes the following in his book A Common Faith: "Any activity pursued in behalf of an ideal end against obstacles and in spite of threats of per sonal loss because of conviction of its general and enduring value is religious in quality" (1934, 27). By "ideal end" he is suggesting something of importance to us, something fundamentally worthy of enhancing the human condition. Dewey certainly captures what I have in mind by spiritual quests as they are natural ized and linked to human needs, cognitive capacity, and neural structures; these qualifications are consistent with Dewey's orientation, along with self-corrective inquiry, nonviolence, and humility. Spiritual quests are not an aberration or a pathological state. They are, rather, a fundamental human need. Moreover, conversions to "seeing" events in a certain way are at the basis of scientific and other forms of human experience, as well as spiritual quests. The pursuit of knowledge has "conversion-like" experiences associated with it (Bloom 2007; Heelan 1994). Religious quests are vital human activities and cut across the sciences and humanities. Religious sensibility is one thing; religious tyranny, quite another. Religious sensibility, at its normative best, is humble and pluralistic. The approach that I suggest avoids dismissive positivism and dogmatic theological fundamental ism and replaces them with a pious naturalism. What underlie spiritual quests are (1) heightened vigilance and some discomfort or unrest about human existence, (2) a search to come to terms with this fact, and (3) the much-appreciated moments of peace and quietude that are necessary for human well-being. What is important is to bring ideas to the lifeblood of experience, to the everyday, to bring the conception of vulnerability and hypothesis-testing inquiry to cover the whole range of human experience, including spiritual inquiry. Thus, in what follows, I suggest, first, that spiritual quests are fundamental to the human condition and then that certain cognitive categories and a basic instinctive response predispose us to express this human need.

Copyright ? 2008 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 307</page><page sequence="2">308 JAY SCHULKIN regions underlie this basic fact about us. I suggest throughout that though it is difficult, we ought to anchor spiritual inquiry to self-corrective inquiry. A Predilection for Spiritual Quests Spiritual quests, like most forms of human inquiry, begin tinged with doubt and self-reflection. Inquiry, as Peirce ([1877] 1992) notes, is to help, in part, to quell doubt, taper it, place it in perspective. In Peirce's words, "The irritation of doubt causes a struggle to attain a state of belief; I shall term this struggle inquiry" ([1877] 1992, 114). What emerges is the search for a semblance of satisfaction to ameliorate the irritation. The first phase of spiritual quests is knotted to appetitive behaviors; search engines permeate the sense experience and the diverse forms of inquiry. The sec ond phase reflects the consummatory behaviors, the sense of accomplishments, achieving goals, securing some sense of satiation. A number of investigators distinguish these two important phases that underlie our experience, namely, the appetitive and consummatory phases of experience (Craig 1918; Dewey [1925] 1989; Tinbergen 1969). I would suggest that this distinction underlies spiritual quests and spiritual inquiry. Although antitheism of any sort is more than a defensible position amid religious dogmatism (e.g., Dennett 2006; Hume [1757] 1956), there is this basic human need, spiritual quests, that we should acknowledge and link to self corrective inquiry and humility. The expression of a humble spiritual quest is replete with nonviolence; Gandhi noted that perhaps "if we remain non-violent, hatred will die as everything does, from disuse" (1964, 43). An important distinction exists between spirituality and religion? spirituality being an important component of the human condition. Most if not all cultures have some forms of what could easily be characterized as religious, spiritual: the many rites that we take for granted, the marvel when we explore a new place (Atran 2002; Boyer 1994; Durkheim 1965; Malinowski 1948; Mead 1964; Whitehouse and Laidlaw 2004). Why do we need spiritual inquiry? Because this sense of religion and our spiritual life are about those things that are of "ultimate concern" (Tillich 1967). Some of the meaning of life is in part the bonds we form with one another (James 1956; Jaspers [1913] 1997). As Karl Jaspers states it: "We are always being led by ideas to a complex unity of meaningful connections" ([1913] 1997, 760). The search for meaning underlies human existence. But the spiritual quest is existentially rooted in some discomfort, and the search to quell this unease reflects an appetitive phase of spiritual inquiry. Kierkegaard has noted that "all existence" ([ 1844] 1980,170) at some level renders one anxious, and the solution from a religious perspective is some resolution.</page><page sequence="3">AN INSTINCT FOR SPIRITUAL QUESTS 309 Several suggestions of a cultural evolution in religious expressions are presented and constitute something I call "Quiet Religion." Discerning "better" ways of this species-specific expression is vitally important and should be linked to a self-corrective hypothetical orientation. Quiet Religion addresses a way of life that requires that we investigate the strengths of various religious traditions. Inquiry lies at the heart of Quiet Religion. Freedom of spiritual quests and their expression has been at the heart of our culture. The normative goal: a spiritual inquiry, knotted to aesthetic sensibility, resulting in greater wonder in our sense of nature (e.g., Dewey 1934; Godfrey-Smith 1998; Whitehead [1938] 1967). The spiritual life lives in flesh, in the body, and in the cultural ambiance that one breathes in diverse forms of cognitive adaptation (Lakoff and Johnson 1999; Varela, Thompson, and Rosch 1991). Humans are part of nature, having evolved as part of it. Human beings share a common biological bond with other animals. Diverse studies of social primates indicate that social bonds are essential for infant survival. Elaborate social intelligence and bonding (Humphrey 1976) amid complex cognitive forms of deception are a common element in hominoid evolution. Quiet Religion cultivates naturalism. Francis of Assisi's love of birds was a deep spiritual union. Zen masters' unity and prowess in nature are real. The images of "mother earth" capture the liveliness of nature. "Sublime" nature demythologized is a real fact (Kant [1792] 1951; Oelschlaeger 1991). Nature demythologized is recognizing our fundamental evolutionary link to nature, the inherent regeneration and rebirth so richly expressed in nature, in so many diverse expressions. For the Epicureans and Lucretius, through Hume and Spinoza, and many "Radical Enlightenment" thinkers, religion meant superstitions. The positivists made it seem like spiritual quests were cognitively meaningless. But spiritual quests are forms of human expression and inherently knotted to cognitive systems. Though religion can indeed numb the intellect or provide a search for a great womb or for a parental figure to provide omniscient protection and comfort (e.g., Freud 1964), it need not. Rather, the spiritual is the call to be awakened, to be attentive to the common bonds in humanity, to be tolerant, as John Locke ([1692-1704] 1955) understood it to be, to collapse the barriers among us, to extend a hand, and to cultivate sacred humanity as a way of life. The sense of a worthy ephemeral event, "perpetual peace" (Kant [1792] 1960, 30), is a religious normative goal that many of us strive for; it reflects the consummatory phase of the experience of religious inquiry. This is an essential end point of Quiet Religion. Amid the recognition of tragedy, struggle, and tur moil, the glimmer of peace creates great joy. The place of peace is one of a shared humanity, a place where all are welcome. Expressed in the words of an African American spiritual, "no one will throw me out." The sense of peace is that "Kingdom of Moral Ends" that Kant ([1788] 1956) describes too, where we treat each other as full human beings, as a "thou" and not as an "it," as Martin Buber (1970), the theologian, has expressed it. That</page><page sequence="4">310 JAY SCHULKIN is, people are treated with dignity, and their worth is recognized, appreciated, cultivated, and loved. This great fantasy of everlasting peaceful coexistence is a worthy myth. It is deeply tied to the spiritual bonds keeping humans afloat amid the turbulence. Erich Fromm has some relevance, as he quotes Abbe Pire in the foreword to one of his books on religion: "What matters is not the difference between believers and unbelievers, but between those who care and those who do not care" (1972). It is the joy of wonder, peace, and love that emerges in ephemeral moments. The issue of the spiritual, and whether it is good or not, is empirical. This means living with the hypothetical nature of our spiritual beliefs and their importance to human sensibility (Neville 1992; Peirce 1998). Categories of the Holy: Nature and Culture The spiritual quest is so much a part of us that it may be akin to our capacity for syntactic competence or language use: a species-specific behavior. Spiritual expression is something only we perform in the animal kingdom. To our knowl edge, no other animal is spiritual. Many scholars have noted the "naturalness of the religious motives" (e.g., Royce [1910] 1940,42; Rue 2005). No other species worships or formulates spiritual quests. Perhaps we humans uniquely possess a set of categories (classes of representations linked together) about divine events. A category of the "Holy" would be presupposed, along with the social practices and rituals that we participate in, for having our spiritual experiences, as well as a sense of the "numinous" (Otto 1975). And these might increase the probability of us treat ing one another in the context of what Kant or Buber describes?the sense of an animate object with beliefs and desires and a sense of agency worthy of respect and dignity. Consider the possibility that categories evolutionarily selected predispose us toward spiritual experiences and such predispositions are part of our hunger for knowledge. It is a cognitive predilection (Atran 2002; Boyer 1994). Diverse religious expressions may reflect the activation of a cognitive competence knotted to a basic orientation, just as in language itself, where there are diverse expres sions set by linguistic structure (Pinker 1994); in other words, perhaps something similar holds for religious expression. Categories of the supernatural are all too readily expressed (Atran 2002; Bloom 2007). They are more readily expressed than those of science. People perhaps have a predilection to form religious beliefs based on basic categories of the mind. The ease with which we do so across cultures and its expression early in the development of the individual suggest that it is natural part of us. The conditions for the possibility of there being a spiritual experience suggest that a cognitive category of the Holy exists.</page><page sequence="5">AN INSTINCT FOR SPIRITUAL QUESTS 311 One cognitive adaptation is the attribution of desires and beliefs (Dennett 1987). Because the intentional stance is fairly pervasive, we tend to extend this to nonhuman agents. The cognitive science of religion reveals that we attribute intentions, beliefs, and desires to superhuman agents (Barrett and Keil 1996). It is a predilection that we have derived from our cognitive arsenal. Our everyday psychological categories, such as the concept of agency or something one could call "animacy," in addition to biological categories (Carey and Gelman 1991; Keil 1979) may interact with the representational capacity for religious expression. Features of spirituality often take two properties, those of superhuman agency and animacy, though they need not (Barrett 2000; Barrett and Keil 1996). One is a supreme sense of agency beyond what we experience ourselves; the second is that of being animate, full of life. Indeed, young children have some understanding of these categories early in life (Carey and Gelman 1991; Keil 1979). They are expressed across a wide range of cultures (Boyer and Ramble 2001). Both categories figure in the organization of human representational capacities (Keil 1979). Religious representations, when experimentally challenged, often tend to be anthropomorphic in nature. One experiment by Barrett and Keil (1996) directly addressed this issue. Little vignettes were constructed to access the subject's con ception of God. Subjects came from different religious backgrounds. They tended to anthropomorphize with regard to the concept of God across the experimental paradigms, independent of their religious or nonreligious predilections. People readily anthropomorphize and naturalize intuitive concepts of divinity. In several studies with participants of different backgrounds and religions, subjects readily used anthropomorphic concepts of divinity in understanding stories, despite their predilection or theological position (Boyer and Ramble 2001). In other words, we come prepared to see the world around us in religious terms; it is in part a reflection of our cognitive machinations, perhaps an aberration from several cognitive adaptations. More generally, cognitive systems underlie religious rituals (Lawson and McCauley 1990; McCauley and Lawson 2002; Whitehouse and Laidlaw 2004). But it is not an aberration to be awestruck by the material features of nature, by our inability to fully capture our surroundings. Categories derived from folk psychology (agency) and folk biology (animism) are perhaps utilized for religious representations. Religious sensibility is as natural to us as eating apples. The ontological features vary, and an extension of our cognitive predilections may be misleading in its application to issues that speak of the religious?the naturalness of unnatural claims (McCauley 2000). Diverse forms of cognitive preconditions set the conditions for religious inquiry (Atran 2002; Boyer 1994) and for spiritual quests. A sense of purpose runs through spiritual quests. But a vast array of religious quests do not contain a Godlike agent (e.g., Taoism, Buddhism [Neville 1992]). One noted Western scholar, for example, in commenting on Buddhism notes the following: "It has been seriously maintained</page><page sequence="6">312 JAY SCHULKIN that Buddhism is not religion at all because it denies God. This it certainly does, but it is nevertheless religion, for it lives in the numinous. The salvation sought in Nirvana like that sought in Yoga is magical and numinous" (Otto 1960, 100). A normative goal is a sense of quiet; attentive peace is the desired end of a quest that is permeated by disciplined discovery. And in some traditions a sense of nature is pervasive, as one acknowledges "the great machinery (of evolution) from which all things come forth (at birth) and which they enter at death" (Chuan Tzu 1962). These traditions certainly con tain a keen sense of living nature?and I would suggest that a sense of animacy underlies spiritual quests amid a seductive statement by the Buddha: "The way is perfect like unto vast space, with nothing wanting, nothing superfluous" (Conze 1984:171; see also Conze 1975). An Instinct for Spiritual Quests Perhaps there is an instinct for religious quests, which is as basic to us as syntax (Peirce 1998). Humans certainly have a predilection for religious expression. Instinct figured importantly for Darwin (1874). The issue that permeates biol ogy and psychobiology is the relationship between what is inherited and what is acquired. Darwin notes that species-specific behavioral and physiological adaptations are richly expressed and tied perhaps to finding sources of energy, to primary motivational systems and their release in suitable environments (see also James 1887). In the Descent of Man (1874), Darwin, as is very well known, compares human evolution to that of other species. He suggests that "the fewness and the comparative simplicity of the instincts in the higher animals are remarkable in contrast with those of the lower animals" (1874, 65). But our connection to each other and our moral pro-social instincts are two of them, and in this regard innate predilection and learning are on a continuum. We have an instinct to learn some things really fast. Language, as Pinker (1994) has noted, at least the syntactical part, is easily construed as instinctual. There are many related and unrelated ideas surrounding the concept of instinct, perhaps there is an instinct for spiritual quests. Spiritual inquiry within Quiet Religion emphasizes an appreciation of the natural world and our tie to it. John Muir captured it as he described the splendor of Yosemite Park. Thoreau described it in his solitary walks in the woods. Many inquirers have described the spiritual sense of being part of nature (e.g., Emerson, Thoreau). Since the Enlightenment, we have often separated spirituality from nature. Spiritual inquiry, to me, means binding nature and culture together. Emerson (1883) among many others has captured the divinity in nature and the important spiritual experiences one has in being part of nature. A natural theology lies</page><page sequence="7">AN INSTINCT FOR SPIRITUAL QUESTS 313 imminent in their thought, one that emphasizes inquiry and an appreciation of nature. Amid this sensibility spiritual investigations are rendered empirical (James 1974). James suggests that the predisposition for such inquiry is part of our psychological constitution. Part of my argument is that the separation of nature and spirit is misguided. The noted scholar Mircea Eliade notes that often for a person on a spiritual quest "nature is never only natural, it is always fraught with religious value (1959, 116). A sense of nature is a very important experience, something one needs (Oelschlaeger 1991; Schulkin 1998a). The God of Mother Earth (Bachofen [1861] 1967; Malinowski 1948) and its power reside there, in the values, ethics, and duties that one has to preserve the ecosphere, to reinterpret nature anew as alive, not dead and inert, and to return to what has been called "Magna Mater" (Oelschlaeger 1991). To lose this tie to nature is to lose something very important, a sense of something being alive (Whitehead 1967). We evolved with nature, and now we evolve further toward a common humanity (e.g., rights [Sarokin and Schulkin 1994]), resurrecting the bond we have with nature and ourselves. Our common humanity and our fundamental tie to nature are ever present. Some of us again view nature as truly alive, but with a shared sense of humanity (Nussbaum 1997). We are deeply part of nature. The experience is one of human dignity. It requires strength and attentiveness. It requires humility and perseverance. For a Buddhist, this sensibility would be called "compassion" (Conze 1975). But there is a cautionary note: our limitations abound (e.g., biological, intellectual, and spiritual). One is bound, yet one glimpses great majesty?the majesty of divine peaceful reciprocity. A sense of mystery and wonder is pervasive; mystery is that spiritual warmth that holds one together. There are times when the spiritual quest leads one into a vast desert. One is alone. Spiritual peace and insights require the realization of the individual. The spiritual sense of Quiet Religion is one of process, of action, of enlarg ing human experiences, and this of course reflects the appetitive, or searching, phase of religious inquiry. It is what James (1974) puts in the context of the healthy minded. Some would suggest that such activities are dependent on anxiety (Kierkegaard [1844] 1980), that faith emerges from the anxiety, the confronta tion of finitude. There is a gentler way of experiencing this freedom of dynamic religion. It requires a balancing of contrast, a capacity to engage the precarious but not to be done in by it. The humanness that can emerge and predominate is embedded in the ceremonies of worldly wisdom and spontaneity. Quiet Religion implies acceptance and stoicism. Humility and thankfulness are the dominant sensibilities. Forgiveness provides constant renewal and restoration to offer hope and to move on. All too many positive emotions are linked to a perceived sense of awe?objects that are unlimited (Keltner and Haidt 2003). The instinct for religion or faith needs to be anchored to ideals worthy of our human condition, humbled by our vulnerability to abuse by one another.</page><page sequence="8">314 JAY SCHULKIN John Dewey (1934) was interested in preserving the sense of religious questions and not foundational forms of religion. Quiet Religion: An Experimental State of Mind Classical pragmatism (see Smith 1978; Stuhr 2000) was knotted to an experimental state of mind. This is extended to religious predilections, and part of my argument is that this is important as a small prophylactic against religious fundamentalism. This experimental state of mind constitutes the fact that (1) claims are hypothetical, (2) a rich set of representational systems is presupposed, and (3) diverse regions of the brain underlie the expression of spiritual quests. This state of mind does not mean, of course, that the same methods are used to determine the utility of the truth-value of the claims. It would be nice to see religious expression toned down, humbled yet strengthened, by an experimental state of mind. Importantly, some sources of spiritual insight might reflect the peaceful part (e.g., Gandhi), and others, the restless part (e.g., Kierkegaard). What is important is to discern the hypothetical nature of our spiritual hypotheses and place spiritual quests amid the larger sense of inquiry (Neville 1992). Underlying religious expression are bodily rituals (Atran 2002; Boyer 1994, 2003). The sense of being embodied as an individual is often a characteristic feature of religious expression. Push aside the Cartesian conception as the only dominant conception of the mind, of divorced mind from body. Rather, what one has are diverse adaptations and the experiences of agents, individuals making sense of their world; it is then that the sense of mind in body takes on real validity (e.g., Damasio 1996; Lakoff and Johnson 1999; Schulkin 2004). Sets of repre sentational capacities, linked to agency and desire, are a fundamental property of the brain (Decety 1996). Cognition pervades human experience. It is not like the body is on one side and cognitive systems are on the other (Lakoff and Johnson 1999; Merleau-Ponty 1967; Schulkin 2000, 2004). All of these actions are rich in cognitive resources, particularly the sense of embodied cognition, so important for spiritual quests (Barsalou et al. 2005; Varela, Thompson, and Rosch 1991). A healthy sense of the mind in the body (agency and animacy in Quiet Religion) can be achieved, for example, by the practice of Tai Chi Chuan, or Yoga (e.g., Delza 1985). The rituals are well composed. The goals are clear. The spiritual sensibility, normatively, is tied to the organization of action and to quiet acts of compassion. Regions of the frontal cortex are essential for a number of higher-order functions, including syntax (Ullman 2001) and, perhaps, the organization of religious rituals; the motor programs are highly cognitive?that is why we call them rituals (McCauley and Lawson 2002). Religious expressions also reflect differential regions of the brain. Regions such as the amygdala (and other regions</page><page sequence="9">AN INSTINCT FOR SPIRITUAL QUESTS 315 of the brain, including the frontal and temporal cortices) may be influential in the basic desires for religious expression. Regions of the frontal cortex (and basal ganglia) may be fundamental in the organization of religious rites. These regions in diverse contexts have been linked to discharges of religious expressions, from kindling-like effects in the amygdala to representations of diverse objects, some seen, some not (Gloor 1997). Importantly, regions of the frontal cortex are active when an individual performs a particular action or when I watch you perform the action, recognizing an individual who is an agent and who is animate (Decety 1996). For example, in one experiment with humans, watching a particular ritualized movement of the hand activates the same region of the frontal cortex as when one is doing the movement oneself. Sharing rituals may mean sharing a neural signature in both what I do and what I watch you do. Diverse regions of the brain, including the amygdala and the larger temporal cortex and frontal cortex, have in diverse studies been linked to religious sensibility (Russell et al. 2002; Saver and Rabin 1997;Wuerfel et al. 2004). Interestingly, regions of the frontal cortex are differentially activated dur ing ritualized meditation (Davidson et al. 2003). The left frontal cortex, which is linked to positive affect, is greater in expression following ritualized meditation; meditation is not a passive state but, rather, a quiet state of reflection. In other words, regions of the brain that are linked to positive emotion are active during states of meditation. Zen and others forms of mediation also are known to promote greater immune function (Austin 2006). In other words, meditation promotes immuno logic defense. This same sense of meditation has long been linked to states of "enlightenment," of grasping things of concern. This state is one of increased attention to details and increased compassion. This state of mediation is strongly tied to well-being and a broad array of positive emotions (Davidson et al. 2003; Ekman et al. 2005). In states of meditation, quiet focus is a profound state of rejuvenation of the brain, and hormones such as prolactin promote neurogenesis in the brain. One set of hormones signals activation (Cortisol, the "wake-up hormone"); the other, quiescence (prolactin). Translated into the brain, certain regions such as the amygdala contain chemical signals (neuropeptide hormones) that quiet one, as well as those that arouse one or orient one toward disruption (Schulkin 1998b). From an evolutionary point of view, meditative states perhaps have roots in those periods in our evolutionary history in which we sat quietly, during the shift perhaps between daylight hours and nighttime, a time of transition in which it was not light but we were not asleep. This would constitute a resting state, perhaps evolving into a reflective state. Hormones such as prolactin are known in humans to be secreted during the dark phase, particularly during the transition between light and darkness (Wehr and Schulkin n.d.; Wehr et al. 1993). Prolactin, like</page><page sequence="10">316 JAY SCHULKIN melatonin (another hormone), is known to be involved in the transduction from light-related activities to a more quiescent state (Wehr et al. 1993). Perhaps before the onset of the modern period, with its chronic lights, there were quiet periods in which we were not asleep but at rest. Perhaps this reflected a "quiet wakefulness" experienced by pre-electric-light societies (Sterling 2004). Importantly, there is evidence that experienced meditators have higher levels of prolactin during meditation than those less experienced. In several studies, the release of prolactin, one of the hormones perhaps linked to quiet reflection, was elevated (Jevning, Wilson, and VanderLaan 1978; Wehr and Schulkin n.d.). Meditative states are restorative states, states of quiescence, and perhaps hormones such as prolactin evolved from a functional role in the transition from activity to rest. Moreover, hormones such as prolactin are, in birds, linked to brooding behavior (Lehrman 1958)?sitting on those eggs. Birds in brooding mode are known to sit motionless for long periods of time. The spiritual life lives in the flesh and in the cultural ambiance that one breathes. Regions of the brain linked to needs, in this case spiritual needs, are recruited in the expression of spiritual inquiry. The amygdala is well suited to serve this func tion, because it underlies a number of drives that we have. What William James has called a "faith state" is part of our psychobiological constitution. The amygdala, hippocampus, and diverse neocortical systems underlie spiritual inquiry (Muramoto 2004; Russell et al. 2002; Saver and Rabin 1997; Wuerfel et al. 2004). Spiritual inquiry, I would suggest, is vital for our self-development, our spiritual needs. Conclusion I have argued that this basic predilection for religious expression needs to be knot ted to self-corrective inquiry and humility?even more so in an age of religious tyranny. Quiet Religion, and what I suggested it entails, does not mean silence. But it does speak of inquiry. I have suggested that two phases of human experience underlie spiritual inquiry: an appetitive phase knotted to search and a consummatory phase knot ted to quiet peacefulness. They can be expressed in the thundering of the most rhapsodic gospel chant, in the interminable Quaker or Buddhist silence, or in the movements and the calls of Jewish davening. Great masses of people are inflamed by the spiritual but have no clear outlet in the modern age. Quiet Religion is an invitation to express that great species specific capacity?the sense of the spiritual?and to pursue becoming a mensch or a good soul. It requires that one look inward but knotted to self-corrective inquiry and vulnerability. I suggest that a sense of inquiry should be at the heart of such a quest. But inquiry is not enough. For the spiritual life has to do with gentle offerings in the face of harsh realities. Spiritual quests are manifest in diverse settings; for James they are linked to the recognition that the good does not always prevail.</page><page sequence="11">AN INSTINCT FOR SPIRITUAL QUESTS 317 Near the end of his book The Varieties of Religious Experience, James characterizes the positive psychological characteristics of religious quests as including (1) "a new zest, which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form ether of lyrical enhancement or of appeal to earnestness and heroism"; and (2) "an assurance of safety and temper of peace and in relation to others, a preponderance of loving affections" (1974, 377). We now know a bit about the cognitive basis of religious expression. Cognitive capacities that reflect folk psychology (agency, intentionality) and folk biology (animacy) appear to be two cognitive resources that render religious expressions possible. James (1974) overemphasizes the extreme and sensory aspects of religious experience. He shows that cognitive penetration pervades all parts of human expression?religious or otherwise. There are no simple givens in any aspect of life, except the historical givens of our experiences, what we are exposed to, the historical contingencies and practices that we participate in because of what we are confronted with. The rich social life of human experience pervades, as do varying forms of understanding on which we rely. Our turn to the spiritual for sustenance emerges, in part, from the insecurity and uncertainty of human existence amid set cognitive preconditions. Quiet Religion is an empirical inquiry into the various modes of spiritual expression. The category of the "Holy," of what is worthy, does not always have definite boundaries. It is nearly impossible to give defining characteristics for natural categories. Two features of Quiet Religion stand out: a sense of awe is made manifest in the face of a pervasive sense of animacy and agency; and religious sensibility is also demythologized, placed in a self-corrective context. Its root is in diverse cognitive abilities, some of which have to do with our sense of biology, a naturalized sense of the world, at times extended beyond what is intelligible. Spiritual inquiry allows for the selection of any tradition in which one chooses to engage and then for the spreading of its wealth to others. But, of course, there is more than one way to generate the gentleness of the community of living citizens, caretakers, concerned individuals awed by the miracle of the communion of humanity. Quiet Religion stresses that ultimate matters are found in a variety of forms. Inquiry predominates. Science and other pursuits in the humanities are engaged, reflected on, and mused about. Individual enlightenment integrates (or does not) those forms into a responsible spiritual fabric. But Taylor (2002), a Canadian philosopher, echoing a philosophical sentiment that has been voiced by others, points to the tension between the personal sense of religious quests and the descent into self-absorption and shallowness. Our social bonds, our respect for each other and toward worthy ends, need also to be anchored to the religious quests. Competition for survival is a factor of evolution. So is the binding of communities; what underlies social bonding is what Darwin calls the pro-social instincts. The trajectory is dependent on what Peirce calls "evolutionary love." But in the age when theological tyranny and political and social arrogance are still common phenomena, when theological dogmatic seduction is the common</page><page sequence="12">318 JAY SCHULKIN currency, Quiet Religion necessitates growing roots in human bonds. Religious sentiments must be based on compassion to one another (e.g., Davidson and Harrington 2002; Fromm, Suzuki, and DeMartino 1970). The achievement is ephemeral and awe inspiring. Peace is felt, dignity is revealed, and benevolence effervesces. And then they are gone. But the moment is preserved. Thus, a category of the Holy is part of our psychobiology. Spiritual inquiry perhaps depends on brain regions such as the amygdala and other regions of the temporal lobe and frontal cortex. Cognitive/neural systems that underlie an orientation to science (Carruthers, Stitch, and Siegal 2002) have evolved from more basic self-corrective problem-solving propensities.
