Morgan Department ofPhilosophy Spring Hill College 4000 Dauphin St. Mobile, AL 36608, USA Abstract - In 1962, Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug published their classic theory of virus structure. They developed their theory with an explicit analogy between spherical viruses and Buckminster Fuller's géodésie dômes. In this paper, I use the spherical virus geodesic dome case to develop an account of analogy and deductive analogical inference based on the notion of an isomorphism. I also consider under what conditions there is a good reason to claim an experimentally untested analogy is plausible. Keywords - Context of Discovery, Spherical Virus, Géodésie Dome, Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus, Quasi-equivalence, Buckminster Fuller, Aaron Klug, Donald Caspar, Francis Crick, James Watson, Isomorphism, Analogical Reasoning, History of Structural Biology, Philosophy of Biology Introduction The history of science is rife with analogies: Gilbert's analogy between the earth and a small magnet; Huygen's analogy between light and sound waves; Lavoisier's analogy between respiration and combustion; Carnot's analogy between heat and fluid flow; Darwin's analogy between natural and artificial selection; Kekulé's analogy between benzene and a snake; Morgan's analogy between chromo somes and beads on a string; and Luria's analogy between mutation and a slot machine, to mention just a few of the more famous. To this list, one may add Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug's analogy between géodésie dômes and spherical viruses, a case little known to historians and philosophers of science. Scientists' use of analogy raises a number of questions for the philosopher of science.11 am interested in two: what is the nature of 1 See, for example, Hesse 1966; Holyoak and Thagard 1995; Bailer-Jones 2002. © 2006 Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn</page><page sequence="2">216 GREGORY J.MORGAN scientific analogy? And what rôles do analogies play in scientific inference? Analogies appear to function in a number of différent ways in science: they may be used pedagogically to increase students' understanding, they may be used to help explain a novel phenome non, or they may be used to formulate novel testable hypotheses, etc. For reasons of space, I will focus only on the use of analogy to infer plausible novel hypotheses that may be pursued further by empirical testing. In other words, I will focus on what is called analogical infer ence or analogical reasoning in the context of discovery. Using Caspar and Klug's analogy between spherical viruses and géodésie dômes, I will sketch an account of analogy and defend a deductive account of analogical inference. In the first section, I narrate the events that led up to Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug's présentation of their theory of virus struc ture. They developed their theory using explicit analogies between géodésie dômes and virus structure. In the second section, I develop an account of analogy based on the notion of an isomorphism. In the third section, I show that once an analogy is made explicit, an ana logical inference is a deductive inference. Finally, I consider infer ences to the plausibility of a useful analogy between two systems. The Genesis of the Caspar-Klug Theory of Virus Structure In June 1962, at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on 'Basic Mechanisms in Animal Virus Biology', Donald Caspar presented the séminal paper, co-authored with Aaron Klug, 'Physical Principles in the Construction of Regular Viruses' (Caspar and Klug 1962). Among other things, they proposed that the protein shells (capsids) of spherical viruses are structured like microscopic géodésie dômes. The ideas they presented were widely accepted until the early 1980s when the first exception to their theory was discovered (in Caspar's lab). The Caspar-Klug theory of virus structure extended ideas of Francis Crick and James Watson who in the mid 1950s hypothesized that the small 'spherical' viruses must have cubic symmetry. Cubic symmetry requires at least four three-fold rotational axes. For exam ple, ail the platonic solids - the icosahedron, the dodecahedron, the cube, the octahedron, and the tetrahedron - have cubic symmetry. Imagine a cube: if you look down the body-diagonal, you are looking down a 3-fold rotation axis and there are four such axes. In 1955, Caspar was able to confirm Crick and Watson's ideas by diffracting x-rays through single crystals of Tomato bushy stunt virus</page><page sequence="3">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY (TBSV). He showed that there were 'spikes' of intensity in the diffrac tion pattern indicating the virus possessed five-fold rotational symmetry and thus very probably icosahedral symmetry (called 532 symmetry by crystallographers), one of the three cubic symmetries. (Mirror symme tries are ruled out by the chirality of protein.) With the knowledge of Caspar's resuit, Crick and Watson rewrote an article for Nature, in which they argued that 'a virus possessing cubic symmetry must nec essarily be built by the regular aggregation of smaller asymmetrical building bricks, and this can only be done in a very limited number of ways' (Crick and Watson 1956, 474). A virus with cubic symmetry is necessarily made up of a multiple of 12 and a maximum of 60 iden tical equivalently-situated 'subunits'. Caspar's experimental results for TBSV were published in Nature immediately following Crick and Watson's article (Caspar 1956). Caspar and Klug began their collaboration in 1958. Rosalind Franklin had been scheduled to present her recent work on virus structure at a plant pathology meeting organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the American Phytopathological Society. Tragically, she lost her battle with cancer in April of 1958, four months before the meeting. Under these unfortunate circum stances, Caspar was invited by the committee to speak in Franklin's place and he invited Franklin's colleague Aaron Klug to be a co author. They wrote a review of the x-ray diffraction of viruses and added her as first author posthumously (Franklin, Caspar and Klug 1959). In June of 1959, Klug and his colleague John Finch published their results on poliovirus. Newspapers popularized their results. The Manchester Guardian printed a half-page story, entitled 'The Architecture of Viruses', on June 30, 1959. One of Buckminster Fuller's intellectual admirers, the proto-pop artist John McHale, read one of the newspaper reports and noticed the potential similar ities between viral structure and Fuller's géodésie dômes. He wrote to Klug and Finch to inform them of the possible connection. Consequently, Fuller met with Klug and Finch on a visit to London later in 1959. Klug and Caspar obtained copies of Robert Mark's book, The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller (1960), and spent some time looking at the many images of géodésie dômes and their construction. The variety of enclosures designed and called géodésie dômes by Fuller make it difficult to define the term. One can however describe an exem plary case. The exemplary géodésie dome is constructed from many approximately equilateral triangular faces. (See Figure 1) It approxi</page><page sequence="4">218 GREGORY J.MORGAN mates a tessellated icosahedron projected onto a sphere, although in most cases not ail the triangular subunits are identical. Many of the edges of the faces, when projected onto a sphere follow arcs of great cir cles, i.e., geodesics. Perhaps viral shells and géodésie dômes were con structed in a similar manner. The possibility of a rich analogy between dômes and viruses suggested that there might exist a one-to-one map ping between the protein subunits of a spherical virus and the subunits of a géodésie dome (Fig. 1). Fig.l - A T=3 géodésie dome (left) and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) at 2.9 Â resolution (right). Each shell consists of 180 subunits. The subunits on five fold axes are colored black. The double headed arrows represent a sample of the one-to-one mapping between the subunits of the géodésie dome and virus coat proteins. Image of TBSV rendered using results from Steve Harrison's group and the Virus Particle Explorer Database (VIPERdb) (Harrison et al., 1978; Shepherd 2006). Under these circumstances, Caspar and Klug came to their famous idea of 'quasi-equivalence', an important concept in the emerging field of structural biology. Their insight was to see that if the inter-subunit bonds can vary a little in their angles and lengths, structures with more than 60 identical quasi-equivalently bonded subunits could be built. Consider the triangular 'subunits' in the géodésie dômes depicted in Figure 1. The subunits lie in at three quasi-equivalent positions. There are subunits in 'pentamers' (groups of five; shaded black in Figure 1) and the two types in 'hexamers' (groups of six). Notice how the relative angles between the neighbors differ slightly for the pentamers and hexa mers. The relaxation in the number of allowed subunits was important because there was increasing evidence that many viruses had more than 60 subunits. Caspar derived a formula that predicted which multiples of</page><page sequence="5">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY 219 60 subunits could build a closed icosahedrally symmetric biological assembly. The formula was remarkably simple: T = h2 + hk + k2 where h and k are non-negative integers. Spherical viruses have 60T subunits and can be classified by their respective T-numbers. Caspar began to write a manuscript that explicated the idea of quasi equivalence. In the meantime, Klug was invited to speak at the 1962 Cold Spring Harbor meeting, a good venue to present their ideas. The resulting paper has become a citation classic with more than 1300 cita tions. (see Morgan 2003; 2004; and 2006 for more détails on the history of early structural virology) Analogy as Isomorphism How exactly did Caspar and Klug use their analogy between viruses and géodésie dômes to develop their theory of virus structure? What did the analogy allow them to do? Did it justify their subséquent devel opment of the analogy? Before one can begin to answer these questions properly, one must clarify the nature of the analogy. As Bailer-Jones (2002) points out, the rôle of analogy in science is closely related to the rôles of models and metaphors in science. For example, Hesse (1966) claims that scientific models are analogues to aspects of the real world. And Black ([1977] 1993) claims that ail metaphors 'may be said to mediate' an analogy (Black ([1977] 1993, 30). Rather than look at the relationships among models, metaphors, and analogies, I plan to examine one important species of analogy directly. The term 'analogy' is sometimes used broadly as a synonym for 'similar ity'. Thus some accounts of analogy begin by defining a similarity met ric to capture the degree of similarity between objects (Niiniluoto 1988). However, like phenetic approaches to biological classification, this approach is fraught with difficulties - which aspects of the respective objects do you select and how? How do you place relative weights on the différent aspects? For these reasons, I will be more concemed with a narrower conception of analogy. On my account, analogy is a binary relation between the source system, e.g., a géodésie dome, and the target system, e.g., a spherical virus, that does not come in degrees. Typically the source system is better studied or more easily studied than the target system that is a given scientist's ultimate object of study. Thus for a virologist, the target system is the virus and the source system is some other purported part of nature the study of which it is hoped will enlighten the study of viruses. Extending a suggestion of Newell and</page><page sequence="6">220 GREGORY J.MORGAN Simon (1972), my account of analogy focuses on the trans-system counter parts of relations that hold between the parts of two systems, rather than an account that is based on the similarity of attributes (Newell and Simon 1972, 851; Gentner 1983). More explicitly: An analogy exists between two systems, the source and the target, if and only if there exists an isomorphic mapping between their respective faithful structures. Understanding this définition requires an understanding of the three terms, 'system', 'faithful structure', and 'isomorphic mapping'. First, a system is either a set of facts, purported facts, fictional facts, or a mixture. Since each fact consists of at least one object and at least one prop erty or relation in which the object stands, a system can also be thought of as a set of objects and properties/relations. Systems can be real or imaginary. A real system is a piece of reality. For example, the components of virus and their structural properties/relations is a real system, as is the com ponents of a géodésie dome and their structural properties/relations. In empirical science, imaginary systems come in two flavors: the simplified systems of idealizations and the non-existent systems posited by false theories. An idealization, unlike an abstraction of a real system, describes simplified relations that do not obtain in reality. Real gases violate the idéal gas laws, for example. Any refuted theory posits at least one false state of affairs. Such falsehoods do not prohibit one from drawing an analogy, however. One could, for example, draw an analogy between a Copernican solar system with circular orbits and a Bohr atom with circular orbits. Neither real electrons nor real planets have circular orbits, but the analogy may nonetheless obtain between the (imaginary) idealized systems. It is important to keep the following ontological cat égories distinct: a phenomenon in nature (the real system), a theory of a phenomenon, and a structure that represents what a theory of a phe nomenon posits. Second, a structure is a représentation of a system.2 It is a set-theoret ic entity consisting of a set of elements (the domain) and sets of ordered «-tapies of these elements. To obtain a structure one must décomposé the system into parts, represent these parts by elements, and represent the n-ary relations that hold between parts of a system by sets of ordered «-tuples of elements. Since a set of «-tuples is normally taken to be a relation, I will use the term 'relation' for both a set of «-tupies and what is represented by the set of ordered «-tuples, i.e., both the abstract set 2 My définition of structure differs from standard présentations of structure in mathematical logic. For example, Enderton (1972,79) takes a structure to be a function whose domain is the set of param eters of a language. My notion of structure is closer to the range of this function.</page><page sequence="7">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY theoretic entity and the posited real n-ary property in the world. A rep résentation of a system is faithful if and only if ail of the features (i.e., the parts of the system and their relations) represented actually exist in the system.3 An abstraction is a faithful représentation, but an idealization is not. For the purposes of the paper, I assume that theories are sets of sen tences, i.e., linguistic entities, that purport to describe the world accu rately. If our theory of the phenomena is true, then a structure that faith fully represents the posits of the theory also faithfully represents nature. One may then say that one draws an analogy between two real systems (i.e., parts of nature). On the other hand, if our theory of the phenome na is false, then the structure that faithfully represents the posits of the theory might not faithfully represent nature and some faithful représen tations of the system will represent false states of affairs. The analogy between the Copernican solar system and a Bohr atom can either be viewed as an analogy between non-existent systems posited by the respective theories, or between two phenomena in possible worlds in which the theories of the Bohr atom and the Copernican solar system are true. In either case, this account of analogy is broad enough to apply to systems that do not obtain in nature. Structures can differ in their degree of abstraction. For example, con sider the following system: the 12-person family of Charles Darwin and Emma Wedgwood. This system might be represented by a struc ture consisting of twelve elements that represent a father, a mother, six boys, and four girls and four sets of ordered pairs that represent the relations, ' is a mother of ' , ' is a father of ' , ' is a son of ' , and ' __is a daughter of '. Alternatively, a more abstract rep résentation is given by twelve elements that represent two parents and ten children and one set of ordered pairs that represent the relation ' is a child of '. To construct the first structure, one requires knowledge of the gender of the members of the family, whereas in the second structure, the genders are abstracted away. Although they dif fer in the degree of abstraction, neither structure introduces any false hood about the Darwins. It is true that the Darwin family consisted of a father, a mother, six sons and four daughters. It is also true that the family consisted of two parents and ten siblings. On my account, this faithfulness to the system is a necessary condition on a structure representing the system. A vital component of a scientist's develop ment of an analogy consists in determining the degree of abstractio^ of the two structures which yields the most informative isomorphism, i.e., maximizes the number of relevant relations shared by both sys 3 Note that this définition differs from the meaning of faithful représentation in Group Theory.</page><page sequence="8">222 GREGORYJ. MORGAN tems without introducing relations which have no counterpart in the other system.4 Note that différences between the two systems, e.g., rela tions that hold in one system with no counterpart in the other, will not appear in either of the two abstract structures that represent the two sys tems if there exists an isomorphism between the two structures. Third, two structures are isomorphic if and only if there exists a one to-one mapping from ail the elements of the source structure to ail the elements of the target structure such that al1 the /z-ary relations have an image in the target structure. There can be finite or infinité numbers of elements. I impose no constraints on the identity of the meaning of the terms one uses to refer to the represented relations under a mapping. If a relation R holds between a and b in the source structure, then in an isomorphic structure there will exist a relation R* that holds between a* and b* (where a* is the image of a and b* is the image of b). However, the terms which refer to the relations represented by R and R* may dif fer in their meaning. Typically people consider analogies where these terms have similar meaning, but it is not part of the définition of an iso morphism nor an essential part of my account of analogy. Higher order formai properties such as the transitivity (or its lack) of each of the 2-ary relations also have an image in the target structure. In fact, as Sellars (1965) points out, both source and target structures often exhibit the same higher order properties (Sellars 1965, 346). An isomorphism is a symmetric relation between two structures. Thus on my account, if there is an analogy between system A and system A", there is also an analogy between system A* and system A. If two structures are fully determined, it is an a priori question whether there exists an isomor phism between them. It is possible to have an analogy between two very différent systems if one structure is sufficiently more abstract than another. In other words, while isomorphism is symmetric, asymmetries between the systems can often be offset by asymmetries in abstraction. In maturing empirical sciences, often the question is whether there is a useful analogy between two real systems. This empirical question has two components: (1) whether there exists an analogy between two real systems and (2) if there exists an analogy, whether it is useful. First, while it is an a priori question whether there is an isomorphism between two structures, one must consult the world to determine whether either structure faithfully represents a real system. Thus, whether there is an analogy between two real systems is empirical. While a faithful structure of a system, as I have defined it, may abstract détail from a system, it must not introduce elements that do not exist, or relations that do not 4For a related discussion of this issue, see Sellars 1965, § III</page><page sequence="9">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY hold in the system represented. If the system is real, one must know some things about it before one can know whether a structure has intro duced relations that do not hold in the system. Second, the usefulness of an analogy is relative to the scientist and to the state of knowledge in question. Scientists wish to be able to infer useful hypotheses, the test ing and refining of which would constitute the continuance of their research program. Let us call an analogy whose structures contain the relations in which a scientist is interested, a useful analogy. Further, if the useful analogy will sustain a research program, let us call it a rich analogy. A goal of constructing an analogy is to determine what degree of abstraction best captures the relations in which the scientist is inter ested. If the structures are too abstract, the relations in which the scien tist is interested will not be represented. If the structures are not abstract enough, there may not be an isomorphism since différences will still be represented or the isomorphism may be too complex to be prac tical. Further, one must add the adjective 'useful' because at some degree of abstraction, everything is analogous to everything else. One dimension of usefulness is the inferential power of the analogy. (I will say more about inferential power in the next section.) The case study sheds some light on how the correct degree of abstrac tion is obtained in practice. In this case, the level of abstraction was con strained by the goal that the scientists wished to achieve. Caspar and Klug had a well-defined problem that they desired to solve. Their prob lem was, given that many viruses have more than 60 protein subunits, how are the subunits of these viruses arranged to form a closed con tainer to protect the viral nucleic acid? The analogy with géodésie dômes was drawn in order to provide a hypothesis about the way in which the viral subunits might be arranged, i.e., a means to achieving their goal. Any structure that did not represent the low-resolution three dimensional arrangement of subunits would be too abstract to be useful to Caspar and Klug. Russell (1989) calls this goal-directed use of analo gy the 'backwards' direction of analogical inference as opposed to the 'forwards' data-driven direction in which a new similarity is inferred from known features of the source without the teleological constraints on what the similarity can be (Russell 1989, 9). One structure that faithfully represents a géodésie dome consists of a domain of n elements that represent n triangular faces and the set of ordered pairs that represent the binary relation ' is adjacent to '. (If the ordered pair &lt;a, b&gt; is a member of the set of ordered pairs repre senting the adjacency relation let us abbreviate this ' aAb' .) Intuitively, two elements are adjacent if and only if the faces they represent share an edge. If xAy and ykz and x*y and y*z, then the faces x and z represent</page><page sequence="10">224 GREGORY.J. MORGAN share a vertex. The triangularity of faces is captured in the structure by specifying that for each element, it is adjacent to exactly three others, i.e., \/ x3y3z~^ûi,xAy &amp; xAz &amp; xAw &amp; x*y &amp; y*z &amp; z*w &amp; \/q{xAq 3 (,q=y /q-z/q-w))). One can specify some high-order relations in terms of the 2-ary relation ' A ' . For example, elements are clustered into groups of five or six, what are called pentamers and hexamers. An ele ment x is a member of a pentamer if and only if 3y3z3(ôlq{xAy &amp; yAz &amp; zAw &amp; wAq &amp; qAx &amp; x*y &amp; y*z &amp; z*iv &amp; w*q). An element x is a member of a hexamer if and only if 3y3z3(iHq3p{xAy &amp; yAz &amp; zAw &amp; wAq &amp; qAp &amp; pAx &amp; x*y &amp; y*z &amp; Z*w &amp; iv*q &amp; q*p). One way to re present other relations, such as the symmetry properties of the virus, is to use a one-to-one function from the set of elements onto itself. A sym metry property exists when such a function preserves ail the adjacency relations (i.e., is an automorphism). Each distinct symmetry will have a distinct function. For example, a function,/(x), that captures a five-fold rotation symmetry will have the property that Vx(/(/(/(/(/(x) ) ) ) ) =x) whereas a function, g(x), which captures a mirror symmetry will have the property Vx(g(g(x))=x). On this account, symmetries can be thought of as analogies of a system with itself. The source structure consisting of n elements and the adjacency rela tion abstracts away features of real géodésie dômes. The structure does not represent the way in which the subunits are held together, for exam ple. The structure representing a spherical virus consists of m elements, which represent what Caspar and Klug called structure units, and which biologists now know are (usually) single protein chains, and the set of ordered pairs that represent the real relation ' is bonded to '. This structure abstracts away the three-dimensionality and the chirality of protein chains. Caspar and Klug's claim that there is an analogy between a spherical virus and a géodésie dome is the claim that there is a one-to one mapping between the n dome elements and the m viral elements (where n - m), such that for any two dome elements, x, y, which repre sent adjacent faces, their images in the virus structure, x*, y*, represent viral subunits bonded to one another. This mapping preserves the icosa hedral symmetry of dome structure in the virus structure. Deductive Inference from an Analogy One important rôle of analogy in science is to allow scientists to infer hypotheses about the target system. These inferences, I will call infer ences from an analogy or simply analogical inferences. One also can infer that it is plausible that a useful analogy exists between two systems.</page><page sequence="11">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY I call this second type of reasoning, inferences to an analogy. In the next section, I will consider inferences to an analogy and in this section I will consider inferences from an analogy I will show that the analogy between viruses and dômes differs from frivolous analogies that do not allow for useful novel inferences. Rather than characterize analogical inference as an amplitive infer ence, I follow Weitzenfeld (1984) and propose that analogical infer ence is actually a deductive inference. The inference from the exis tence of an n-ary relation R in the source structure to the existence of a counterpart n-ary relation R* in the target analog is an elliptical inference. The suppressed premise is that there exists an isomorphism between the two structures. If one makes the suppressed premise explicit, the inference has the following form: 1. There exists an isomorphism between structure A and structure A* 2. Relation R exists in structure A /. There exists a relation R* in structure A* A narrower conception of analogy can be defined if one restricts the meaning of the term which refers to the counterpart relation represented by R* to have the same meaning as the term which refers to the relation represented by R, but this is not required in the more général définition. Ail that the isomorphism requires is that if the relation R holds among source components a1; ... , an, then there exists some relation R* which holds among the target compo nents a,*, ... , a*, where the mapping takes a; to a*. Without con straints on the meanings of R and R* there is the possibility of inducing counterpart relations under arbitrary mappings, but these ad hoc analogies will not tend to produce useful inferences and thus will usually be examples of frivolous analogies. (I will discuss frivo lous analogies further below.) Inferences made by Caspar and Klug were more concrete than the scheme above since the nature of the isomorphism is easily made explicit. Because there are only a finite number of elements in the dome source and viral target structure the mapping can be enumerat ed. It consists of a set of ordered pairs, i.e., {&lt;dome element a1; virus element &amp;*&gt;, &lt;dome element a2, virus element a2*&gt;, ... , &lt;dome ele ment an, virus element aB*&gt;}. For an example of a more concrete infer ence consider the following: suppose one names two adjacent dome elements, al and a2. It follows that ajAa2. From this fact and the enu merated isomorphism, one can deductively infer that a1*A*a2*. As men tioned in the last section, the image of the relation '_A_' , i.e., '_A*_' represents the relation '_is bonded to_' , thus the conclusion is that a* and a2* represent subunits bonded together in the virus structure.</page><page sequence="12">226 GREGORY J.MORGAN One can also draw inference to the cardinality of the elements in the target structure. For example, 1. There exists an isomorphism between structure A and structure A* 2. Structure A consists of n elements Structure A* consists of n elements. Caspar and Klug made inferences of this form. They were interested in the number of subunits that made up a viral shell. By determining the number of elements in the faithful structure of a given géodésie dome, they could infer the number of subunits in the analogous virus. This pre diction/hypothesis could then be tested biochemically. Some analogies have little inferential power. Inferential power is a measure of the number of useful inferences that can be drawn weighted by their relative utility. I call analogies with little inferential power friv olous analogies. One species of frivolous analogies contain few useful relations in the structures that represent the systems. For this reason, these analogies do not allow one to infer a number of useful novel hypotheses needed to sustain a research program.5 Frivolous analogies are not rich analogies. The ability to sustain a research program is, ceteris paribus, proportional to the inferential power of the analogy. On my account, frivolous analogies do not differ in kind, but only in degree, from non-frivolous analogies. The différence between frivolous and non-frivolous analogies that support equally useful inferences is simply the number of novel inferences one can make. For example, James Clerk Maxwell compared the molecules of a gas to a swarm of bees: 'If we wish to form a mental représentation of what is going on among the molecules in calm air, we cannot do better than observe a swarm of bees.' (Maxwell [1873] 1952, 368) One symptom of the frivolousness of the analogy is the absence of a mathematical treatment of bee swarms that if appropriated for the study of gases would allow Maxwell to infer useful novel hypotheses about gases. Most mathematical models embody numerous useful relations that, if present in an analogous source system, would allow one to make useful inferences about the tar get system. Rather, Maxwell merely wanted us to make a single infer ence: conclude that if one could see gas molecules, they would appear to be a relatively stationary morass of individual small masses 'flying furiously'. Often frivolous analogies are used pedagogically or in popu larizing scientific ideas to the non-mathematical layperson. I am concerned only with non-frivolous analogies, which is not to say 5 Kekulé's analogy between benzene and a snake is a frivolous analogy as I have defined it. There was only one inference: Kekulé inferred that the benzene molecule was circular and so began the field of aromatic organic chemistry. However, aromatic chemists did not refer to snakes to make further advances in their field and so the analogy did not guide a research program.</page><page sequence="13">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY that there are not frivolous analogies in the early history of structural virology. For example, Crick and Watson (1956) suggest that under high magnification, a 'spherical' virus may appear 'like a rather spherical mulberry' (Crick and Watson 1956, 474). Horne and Wildy (1961) sug gest that the asymmetrical building blocks of viruses may be bundled together like a 'faggot', i.e., a bundle of sticks (Horne and Wildy 1961, 357). Their idea is that an individual stick is asymmetrical, but a bundle has approximate rotational symmetry. Clearly, no one is suggesting that to study viruses one needs to look at berries or bundles of sticks, and rightly so. Rather the inferential power of frivolous analogies tends to be quickly exhausted and they do not allow for the forma tion of a research program aimed at further development of the anal ogy. The analogy between dômes and viruses is not frivolous. It allows one to infer numerous useful novel hypotheses that are able to guide a research program in structural virology: it is a rich analogy. In fact, Caspar and Klug implicitly draw an analogy for every type of spherical virus. Consider the foliowing inferences: 1. The faithful structure representing Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is isomorphic to the faithful structure representing a T=3 géodésie dome. 2. A T= 3 géodésie dome has 180 subunits. /. TBSV has 180 subunits. Note that the conclusion can be about the virus itself and not merely about the structure representing the virus, if the structure is a faithful représentation of the virus. What is true of the faithful structure is also true of the virus. 1. The faithful structure representing Adenovirus is isomorphic to the faithful structure representing the T=25 géodésie dome. 2. The structure representing the T=25 géodésie dome has 240 hexamers. •\ Adenovirus has 240 hexamers. 1.The faithful structure representing TBSV is isomorphic to the structure representing the T= 3 géodésie dome. 2.The faithful structure representing the T=3 géodésie dome has three types of quasi-equivalent elements. .\ TBSV has three types of quasi-equivalent elements. These analogies can be generalized to apply between a generalized géo désie dome and a generalized spherical virus: 1. The faithful structure of the T=n géodésie dome is isomorphic to the faithful structure of a T=n spherical virus. 2. The faithful structure of the T=n géodésie dome has 60n</page><page sequence="14">228 GREGORYJ. MORGAN elements, 60(«-l) elements arranged in rings of 6, and 60 elements arranged in rings of 5. /. A T-n spherical virus has 60n elements, 60(/z-l) elements arranged in rings of 6, and 60 elements arranged in rings of 5. In sum, there is a non-frivolous rich analogy between géodésie dômes and viruses since one can represent viruses and dômes faithfully with isomorphic structures and the isomorphism allows for many useful hypotheses to be made about viruses. These inferences proved worth while for virology because they sustained a research program and saved Caspar, Klug, and others additional time and effort that would have been necessary if they had developed a theory directly from the obser vation of viruses. Inferences to a Plausible Analogy On my account, it is an empirical question whether there exists a useful analogy between two real systems, such as between a géodésie dome and a spherical virus. Therefore, to justify a claim that there is an analogy between two systems will require empirical evidence that two isomorphic structures faithfully represent the target and source systems. However, this is not to say that there cannot be reasons for thinking that a given useful analogy is plausible before one begins designing experiments to test whether the analogy actually exists. By 'plausible' I mean that the probability of the analogy given the back ground knowledge is greater than some significantly non-zero thres hold value k, i.e., p(analogy/B) &amp; k. I take plausibility to be a stronger than mere physical possibilité but a weaker than high probability. The exact numerical value of k is difficult to specify and varies from context to context. Why is a plausible analogy important for a scientist? An expérimen tal researcher aims to generate plausible hypotheses about her target system since the testing of these would constitute the continuance of her research program. Given one can say that there is a reason to think that an isomorphism between viral structures and géodésie dômes is plausi ble, does it follow that there is a reason to think that the conclusion of an analogical inference, i.e., the potential hypothesis, is also plausible? Consider the form of the analogical inference: 1. There exists an isomorphism between faithful source structure A and faithful target structure A*. 2. Relation R, exists in structure A.</page><page sequence="15">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY There exists a relation R * in the target structure. If there is a reason for thinking that the first premise is plausible and one détermines that the second is true, is there a reason to think that the conclusion is plausible? Yes, since any reason to think that R* does not exist in A* is also a reason to think that the isomorphism does not exist. This can be shown more formally also. A useful analogy is plausible if and only if p(analogy/B) s k where k&gt; 0 and B stands for background knowledge. One may write p(analogy/B) = p((the appropriate map ping/B) &amp; (Rj* in A*/Rj in A &amp; B) &amp; (R2* in A*/R2 in A &amp; B ) &amp; ... &amp; (R„* in A*/Rb in A &amp; B)). Since p(X &amp; Y/B) s p(X/B) is a theorem of the probability calculus, p(R/' existing in A*/Rz exists in A &amp; B) a k. If A* is a faithful structure and that R, exists in A is part of the background knowledge, then one may infer, p(R; exists in the target system/B) s k. Thus, if one has reason to think an isomorphism is plausible between two faithful structures, one has reason to take the conclusions of ana logical inferences using these structures as plausible also. The task then is to show under what conditions a useful analogy is plausible. What would constitute a reason for thinking it is plausible that a use ful analogy exists between two systems? In général, the idea is that one can justify an analogy's plausibility by appealing to some relevant com monality between the two systems and by showing that the différences between the two systems are irrelevant for the analogy. For example, it is plausible there would be an analogy between two copies of the same issue of The New York Times because common processes produced both copies. Thus, a common process of production provides a reason to think it is plausible that isomorphism exists between two faithful struc tures that represent products of that process. This is why biologists commonly assume that an analogy between same-aged members of the same biological species is plausible. More generally, homologous bio logical traits are often analogous (in the current sense) because there is a common developmental process. Unfortunately, dômes and viruses do not share a common develop mental process, so one must look elsewhere for the justification of this analogy's plausibility. I suggest that one can begin by appealing to the respective functions of dômes and viruses. Of course, in général, the inference from common function to isomorphic structure, or even the weaker inference from common function to the plausibility of an iso morphic structure is fallacious. Both inferences depend on the number of plausible ways the same function can be realized in différent struc tures. Thus, the considération of common function serves merely as a starting point in our discussion. At one level of description, dômes and viral shells have the same purpose. Both have the function of enclosing</page><page sequence="16">230 GREGORY J.MORGAN space so as to create a safer environment inside than outside. Architects design dômes to protect the inside from wind, précipitation, fluctua tions in temperature, etc. Viral shells function to protect the viral nucle ic acid from external threats to its integrity such as enzymes called nucleases that break nucleic acids into pieces, thereby destroying any ability of the virus to replicate. There is also, however, an obvious disanalogy between dômes and viruses. Dômes are man-made structures whereas viruses are natural biological agents. Given this disanalogy, one might protest that it is anthropomorphic to attribute functions to natural entities. However, much work in contemporary philosophy of biology has been expended to show that a useful naturalistic concept of biological function can be successfully defended.6 Although there are différences between natural functions and intentional functions, there remains enough similarity that one can compare human designs with natural designs. A useful heuristic is to think of viruses and dômes as solutions to analogous design problems.1 The similarities between the problems that dômes and viruses solve provide the beginnings of a reason to think it is plausible that an analogy between the respective solutions exists. There are many ways of skinning a cat, so to speak, and one is not inclined to think that ail cat-skinning solutions are isomorphic. Why then should one think that it is plausible that viruses and dômes are analogous solutions to analogous problems? Given the constraint that you must build a structure out of nearly identical subunits that bond together in quasi-equivalent ways, géodésie dômes are very efficiently built closed structures. Buckminster Fuller made much mileage of this fact when promoting his dômes, often citing the weight-to-volume ratios of dômes, which are orders of magnitude less than conventional build ings. Given the intense selection pressures and the amount of time virus es have been evolving, there is good reason to think that viruses have evolved highly efficient solutions to the problem of enclosing space. The implicit assumption is that there are a small number of solutions, possi bly a unique solution, to the problem of efficiently enclosing space using nearly identical subunits. Adding the constraint that the solution must be efficient excludes structures that inefficiently solved the same prob lem, but unfortunately it does not tell us how many différent (i.e., non analogous) plausible efficient solutions there might be. Even with the constraint that the solution must be efficient, it is pos sible that there are many plausible efficient non-analogous solutions. In 6 Many of the important papers are anthologized in Allen 1998 7 For a defense of this heuristic, see Cosmides et al. 1992, ff. 10.</page><page sequence="17">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY which case it might not be plausible that there is a useful analogy between two solutions. Both the electric chair and lethal injection are efficient ways of solving the same problem, i.e., performing capital pun ishment in a reliable quick manner, but there is no useful isomorphism between the two processes. Clearly one needs further evidence before one can say that it is plausible that viruses and dômes solve the same problem analogously. Perhaps the most significant piece of information for Caspar and Klug was that dômes and viruses appeared similar. The first good electron micrographs of viruses showed structures that appeared like miniature géodésie dômes. (See, for example, Brenner and Horne 1959) Furthermore, Caspar and Klug were impressed with the ease with which dômes could be constructed. Often unskilled work ers assembled the dômes by blindly following a small number of simple 'bonding' rules. Likewise, viruses must assemble their shells without the oversight of an intentional being. With this point in mind, Francis Crick claimed that the assembly of the viral subunits into the closed shell should be simple enough that a child could do it. However, even some degree of similarity added to the knowledge that viruses and dômes have solved analogous problems efficiently is still not enough to say that it is plausible that the solutions are usefully analogous. To infer that an analogy is plausible, in addition to structures solving analogous problems one must know of no reasons for think ing that the structures are significantly différent. To return to the géodésie dome/spherical virus case study, a potential différence might be the différence in scale. Dômes are on the order of tens of meters in diameter whereas viruses are merely nanometers across. Fortunately, common reasons for thinking that the solutions to the problem of efficiently enclosing space may be scale-dependent are not relevant in this case. First, both géodésie dômes and viruses are small enough that any relativistic effects due to the curvature of space-time are insignificant. Second, since viruses are sufficiently massive (on the order of millions of Daltons where one Dalton = the mass of one Hydrogen atom), quantum effects are negligible. Finally, one should consider properties of objects that are scale dependent such as, surface-to-volume ratio. If one assumes that the weight of an object is proportional to its volume, then the weight of an object increases to the cube as its surface area increases to the square. Since a material structure has to be able to support its own weight, one might not expect a solution for a small material struc ture also to be a solution for a larger structure. For example, larger animais are not merely scaled versions of smaller animais (Maynard Smith 1968, 7). In the case of viruses and géodésie dômes, however, this</page><page sequence="18">232 GREGORY J.MORGAN is a scaling clown in size, so these considérations suggest that viruses would both be relatively stronger than géodésie dômes and better solutions to the problem. In sum, these three reasons why a solution to a problem at one scale would not be a solution at another scale are not applicable to the virus/geodesic dome case. There are no good reasons in the background knowledge to suggest that viruses and dômes have non-analogous solutions to the problem of efficiently enclosing space and it was plausible to think that a useful analogy existed between the two systems. To generalize the above discussion, I propose the following principle: It is reasonable to infer that a useful analogy between two systems is plausible if they look similar, are efficient solutions to analogous prob lems, and there are no good reasons in the background knowledge to think otherwise. This is not to say it is physically impossible that sim ilar looking solutions to the same problem are not usefully analogous. However, the mere existence of this possibility without any reason to think it is true should not lead one to think that it is implausible that the two solutions are analogous. And this situation is exactly what one should expect for empirical science - for if there were a conclusive answer based merely on reflection prior to any expéri mentation, there would be no research program and no experiments for scientists to conduct. Most non-frivolous analogies in empirical science require testing before one can be justified in believing that they exist; nonetheless, there may be reason to think they are plau sible before any experiments are undertaken, as there was in this case. Empirical testing increases the probability that the analogy exists given our background knowledge, if it increases our knowl edge of isomorphism between the two solutions. For example, bio chemical experiments showed that viruses had the same number of subunits as the postulated analogous dômes. This fact increases the probability that a useful analogy between dômes and viruses actual ly exists. Conclusion Historians and philosophers of science have overlooked one of the most successful biological theories developed in the 1960s: the Caspar-Klug theory of virus structure. Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug developed their theory with explicit analogies with Buckminster Fuller's géodésie dômes. Dômes and viruses looked similar and it was reasonable to think of dômes and viruses as effi</page><page sequence="19">GEODESIC DOME-SPHERICAL VIRUS ANALOGY 233 ciently solving analogous problems. Furthermore, obvious candidates for barring macro-world solutions in the micro-world were not applica ble. Thus, Caspar and Klug reasonably judged the analogy to be plausi ble. In général, if two systems resemble one another, are both efficient solutions to analogous problems and there are no reasons to think the contrary, then there is a reason to think that a useful analogy is plausi ble. Through drawing the analogy between géodésie dômes and virus es, Caspar and Klug were able to infer novel plausible hypotheses about viruses by first considering géodésie dômes. I argued that analogical inference is a form of deductive inference. Given that it is plausible that a useful analogy exists between two systems, and that relation R holds in the faithful source structure, it follows that it is plausible that R* holds in the target system. Virologists can then design experiments to test these plausible novel hypotheses. If the experiments confirm the hypothesis, the existence of the analogy between dômes and viruses is empirically supported. In général, the existence of an analogy between real systems is an empirical ques tion, which does not imply that analogies cannot hold between imaginary systems or between a real system and an imaginary sys tem. This account of analogy can be applied to other systems. Whenever there is a reason to think a useful analogy between two relatively unstudied systems is plausible, one can infer plausible novel testable hypotheses about the target system. One expects to find this type of reasoning in science concentrated in cases in which studying the target system directly is significantly more difficult than studying the source system or when studying the target system directly is prohibitive. With différent disciplines in science studying nature at différent scales, it would be surprising if the Caspar-Klug analogy between systems at différent scales were the only member of this species of useful analogy.
