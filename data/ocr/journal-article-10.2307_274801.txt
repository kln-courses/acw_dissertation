<plain_text><page sequence="1">By BERNARD BELL Folk Art and the Harlem Renaissance AJOR ATTEMPTS by Afro-American academicians and artists to iden- tify the strengths of Afro-American folk art and its potentialities for a black American tradition of high art have been strikingly similar to the spirit if not the letter of Herder's folk ideology. There is more than adequate circumstantial evidence that W. E. B. DuBois, Alain Locke and James Weldon Johnson - the elder statesmen of the Harlem Renaissance - were familiar with Anglo-American interpretations of Herder's theory that folk art laid the base for high art and the corollary concept of folksong as a spontaneous, indigenous expression of the collec- tive soul of a people. Interpretations of the pronouncements by Herder and the Grimm brothers generated a controversy in Europe between the concepts of group or folk poetry and individual or art poetry. Toward the close of the nineteenth century the group or communal theory was appropriated by America and applied to the ballads. Spearheaded by the scholarship and example of Francis James Child,1 Francis Barton Gummere,2 and George Lyman Kittredge,3 Harvard University became the bastion of communalists. "The orthodox communalist," writes D. K. Wilgus in Anglo-American Folksong Scholarship Since 1898, "held that folk poetry is a genre which precedes and is antithetical to the poetry of art, that it springs spontaneously from a people, and that it is com- posed collectively by the people."4 Of the three proponents, only Gum- mere seems to have been orthodox. Child, Wilgus reveals, "explicitly denied three fundamental tenets of the communalists: that ballads were dance songs, that they were of group authorship, and that they originated among the peasantry or in a classless society."5 What Child actually be- lieved was that "'truly national or popular poetry' developed in a stage of society in which 'there is such a community of ideas and feelings that the whole people form one individual! . . . This community of thought and feeling (not the homogeneous society of his followers) explains why the composition of one man 'will always be an expression of the mind and heart of a people as an individual and never the per- sonality of individual men. "6 Both Gummere and Kittredge were dis- ciples of Child. And while Gummere was the more prolific and ingenious scholar, Kittredge seems to have influenced more communalists,7 in- 'See The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, 5 vols.

Modern ballad scholarship is said to have begun with Kittredge. He kept the faith with the assumptions and conclusions of Child and Gummere, but produced a generation of scholars who eventually dis- proved his statement that ballad-making and ballad-singing were lost arts. It was Kittredge who gave academic validity to the antiquarian (Rousseauistic) revision of Herder's ideas when he wrote in the Introduc- tion to the abridged English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1904): ... quite apart from what we call literature, there is a great mass of miscellaneous song and story which circulates among those who have neither books nor newspapers. To this oral literature... education is no friend. Culture destroys it, sometimes with amazing rapidity. When a nation learns to read, it begins to disregard its traditional tales; it feels a little ashamed of them; ;and finally it loses both the will and the power to remember and transmit them.... To this oral literature belong the popular ballads, and we are justified, therefore, in calling them 'folk poetry.' They are not, like written literature, the exclusive possession of the cultivated classes in any community. They belonged, in the first instance, to the whole people, at a time when there were no formal divisions of literate and illiterate; when the intellectual interests of all were substantially identical, from the king to the peasant. As civilization advanced, they were banished from polite society, but they lived on among the humble, among shepherds and ploughboys and 'the spinsters and the knitters in the sun,' until even these became too sophisticated to care for them and they were heard no more.8 Kittredge also described the characteristic method of ballad composition "as improvisation in the presence of a sympathetic company which may even, at times, participate in the process," but went on to concede: It makes no difference whether a given ballad was in fact composed in the manner described, or whether it was composed (or even written) in solitude, provided the author belonged to the folk, derived his material from popular sources, made his ballad under the inherited influence of the method described, and gave it to the folk as soon as he had made it,-and provided, moreover, the folk accepted the gift and subjected it to that course of oral tradition which... is essential to the production of a genuine ballad.9 Stirred by the vitality of Afro-American folksong, their own ivy league education, travels abroad and quest for a new phase of group develop- ment, DuBois, Locke and Johnson - as we shall see - applied the impli- cations of Herder's theories (as refracted through the prism of Kittredge's pronouncements) to the spirituals, sermons, blues and jazz. At this point, it is important to remember that most nineteenth century scholars and folklorists rejected the notion of Afro-American culture, paradoxically identifying black American music as African and imitative 8p. xii. 9 Quoted in Wilgus, op. cit., p. 34. 156</page><page sequence="3">FOLK ART AND THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE Anglo-American music.10 The fact that most early collections of slave songs were spirituals and rarely included ballads also confused white academicians and encouraged them to exclude Afro-American music from the American canon of folksong. Among the first to part the veil of ignorance and celebrate the virtues of the spirituals was DuBois. William Edward Burghardt DuBois graduated from Fisk University in 1888 and went on to earn his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895. He also spent two years (1892-4) of rigorous study at the University of Berlin. While in Germany, he visited Strasbourg, where Herder and Goethe began their life-long friendship, Rhernpfalz, where he "had an excellent op- portunity to study the peasant life closely and compare it with country life in the South,"11 and Weimar, where Herder spent his final years in the court of Duke Karl August.12 Before returning to the United States, DuBois also toured parts of Italy, Venice, Poland and France. Considering his ambitious pursuit of knowledge in several disciplines at a time when William James, Josiah Royce, George Santayana, Francis Child, Albert Bushnell Hart and George Lyman Kittredge were the great minds of Harvard and considering his training and travels on the continent, it is unlikely that DuBois remained untouched by the spirit and thought of Herber, Goethe, and Rousseau. The Souls of Black Folk, published in 1903, was a history-making collection of essays. It had, as James Weldon Johnson stated, "'a greater effect upon and within the Negro race in America than any other single book published in this country since Uncle Tom's Cabin.'"3 More pertinent to our concern is the affirmation of a spiritual black com- munity revealed in the title, structure and biblical style of the book. Identifying himself in the Forethought as "bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil," DuBois, in fourteen chapters each prefaced by a brief passage of poetry and a bar of the Sorrow Songs, outlines the spiritual world in which black Americans struggle to survive. "They that walked in darkness," he writes in the chapter on folk- songs, "sang songs in the olden days- Sorrow Songs - for they were weary at heart. And so before each thought that I have written in this book I have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these weird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men."14 Proclaiming Afro- American folksong "the singular spiritual heritage of the nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people," DuBois restates in Afro-American terms Herder's ideas on the importance of folk music as a window into the souls of a people and as the basis of a new nation's formal art. He con- siders the music essentially African in origin, recognizes its progressive hybridization and describes the creative process of the spirituals in much 10 See Melville J.

The circumstances of the gathering, however, the rhythm of the songs, and the limitations of allowable thought, confined the poetry for the most part to single or double lines, and they seldom were expanded to quatrains or longer tales, although there are some few examples of sustained efforts, chiefly paraphrases of the Bible."'5 The essay "Of the Sorrow Songs" alludes to the existence of secular Afro- American music - including the debased "minstrel" and "coon" songs - but deemphasizes their importance. In later years as editor of the Crisis (1910-33) DuBois championed the cause of high art but encouraged black Americans to turn to their usable past for inspiration and originality. Like DuBois, Alain Leroy Locke was nurtured in high art but had a deep affinity for Afro-American folk art. He, too, was educated at Harvard (A.B., 1907, Ph.D. 1918) and the University of Berlin (1910-11). Trained in philosophy, Locke was the first black Rhodes Scholar (1907-10). During and subsequent to his three years at Oxford University, he became a frequent visitor to the capitals of the world and drank deeply at the fountains of Western Culture. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that Locke was familiar with the philosophical and folkloristic formulations of Herder and Kittredge. In 1916 Locke began a long, dis- tinguished career as Professor of Philosophy at Howard University. And as editor of the Bronze Booklets and author of numerous articles and booksl6 he was among the first to hail the black Americans' spiritual Coming of Age. The New Negro (1925), edited by Locke, is considered the landmark of the Harlem Renaissance. It not only celebrated what Locke optimis- tically described as "the attainment of a significant and satisfying new phase of group development" by Americans of African descent, but also revealed a vastly modified form of Herdian folk ideology and cultural pluralism. These include an emphasis on the dignity of oppressed groups (the common man) and on the vitality of folk art; an effort to establish the legitimacy of racial expression and the functional character of Afro- American folksongs as a response to the particular experience of Amer- ican history, and finally, an attempt to relate the signficance of Harlem, as a community of diverse elements and an emerging common conscious- ness, to its prototypes in the cultures of other nations. To Locke, Negro youth spoke out of "an unique experience and with a particular representativeness." In the vanguard of a new cultural awak- ening they embodied the potentiality of bridging the gap between folk and high art. "All classes of a people under social pressure are permeated with a common experience," Locke writes, "they are emotionally welded "f Ibid. p. 188. 6See, for example, The New Negro (New York, 1925), Four Negro Poets (New York, 1927), The Negro and His Music (Washington, 1936), and The Negro in Art (Washington, 1940). 158</page><page sequence="5">FOLK ART AND THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE as others cannot be. With them, even ordinary living has epic depth and lyric intensity, and this, their material handicap, is their spiritual ad- vantage. So, in a day when art has run to classes, cliques and coteries, and life lacks more and more a vital common background, the Negro artist, out of the depths of his group and personal experience, has to his hand almost the conditions of a classical art."17 In other words, the elemental nature of the Afro-American folk tradition is the distillation of the black Americans' struggle to survive in an alien and hostile environ- ment. This was the reality behind Locke's observation that the Negroes of his day relied "upon the race-gift as a vast spiritual endowment from which our best developments have come and must come."18 It is im- portant to remember, however, that race as objectively employed by the younger generation was not, in Locke's view, a provincial cul de sac, but "an idiom of experience, a sort of added enriching adventure and dis- cipline, giving subtler overtones to life, making it more beautiful and in- teresting, even if more poignantly so."19 In this sense, it means a deepen- ing rather than a narrowing of social vision. Digging "deep into the racy peasant undersoil of the race life" in order to free themselves from the distorted dialect of the minstrel tradition, the poets of the period "carried the folk-gift to the altitudes of art." In short, what Locke sensed in the "flavor of language, flow of phrase, accent of rhythm in prose, verse and music, color and tone of imagery, idiom and timbre of emotion and symbolism" was the ambition and promise of black artists to make a distinctive contribution to the general development of national art.20 The most acclaimed product of the race genius in America during the Harlem Renaissance was the spirituals. "But," as Locke points out, "the very elements which make them uniquely expressive of the Negro make them at the same time deeply representative of the soil that produced them. Thus, as unique spiritual products of American life, they become nationally as well as racially characteristic."21 The creators of these folk songs, he believed "worked them up from the 'shout' and rhythmic elements of the sensuous dance." But out of this humble origin emanates an epic intensity and tragic profundity for which Locke says "the only historical analogy is the spiritual experience of the Jews and the only analogue, the Psalms."22 On the other hand, he felt that the exquisite combination of Christian sentiment and music found in the spirituals rank them with the Latin hymns, Gregorian tunes and rarest of German chorals.23 And though he expressed reservations about the spirituals as poetry, Locke maintained that their broken dialect and grammar were invariably the results of an instinctive euphonic sense in following the 7 Locke, The New Negro (New York, 1968), p. 47. 18 Ibid.

' Locke, The New Negro, p. 200. a Ibid., p. 201. 159</page><page sequence="6">PHYLON requirements of the musical rhythm.24 With full knowledge of the folksong origins of the European classics, Locke, DuBois, and Johnson were convinced that the black musician who maintained his relationship with the best traditions of the spirituals and organized their distinctive elements in a formal way would be the musical giant of his age. In the past the chief bond between black Americans was a common condition rather than a common consciousness. However, like Garvey and DuBois, Locke saw Afro-Americans as "the advance-guard of the African peoples" and Harlem as the cultural capital of the race. "In Harlem," he declared, "Negro life is seizing upon its first chances for group expression and self-determination. It is - or promises at least to be - a race capital. That is why our comparison is taken with those nascent centers of folk expression and self-determination which are playing a creative part in the world today. Without pretense to their political significance, Harlem has the same role to play for the New Negro as Dublin has had for the New Ireland or Prague for the New Czechoslovakia."25 Locke, then, was among the first cultural historians to see Harlem as the key community in black America and in his own unique way affirmed Herder's belief that the highest cultural values are to be found in the lowest orders of society. Equally important for his example as well as his thoughts on folk art during the Harlem Renaissance was James Weldon Johnson. He was imbued with a deep sense of respect for high art by his West Indian background, cosmopolitan tutors and white New England teachers at Atlanta University, where he graduated in 1894.26 At the same time, he was no stranger to the folk cultures of Georgia, where he taught during his summer recess from college, and of his home town in Jacksonville, Florida, where he was equally inspired by the urbane music of Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church, the chanted sermons of revivalist preachers and the African music of "ring-shouters."27 Curiously enough, of all the books he read as a youth, "the stories by the Brothers Grimm made the deepest effect."28 In 1900, he wrote the lyrics to "Lift Every Voice," the Negro National Anthem. Then, under the influence of Dunbar and teamed with his brother Rosamond and a friend, Bob Cole, Johnson blossomed into one of the leading writers of musical comedy tunes in dialect. Also about this time, he discovered Whitman's Leaves of Grass. "I was engulfed and submerged by the book, and set floundering again,"29 he wrote. It was the impact that Whitman had on him which triggered the realization of the artificiality of conventionalized Negro dialect Ibid., p. 204. 25Locke, The New Negro, p. 7. 26 Johnson took considerable pride in his matrilineal West Indian ancestry. It is also in- teresting to note that one of his tutors was a West Indian cobbler whose command of the English language and classical literature was impeccable.

After touring Paris and London, Johnson returned to New York to study dramatic literature and creative writing under Brander Mat- thews at Columbia University. The main fruit of these early years as a folk art enthusiast, popular song-writer for the theater, and poet was The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Published anonymously in 1912, The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man is the story of Negro soul denied. The special genius of Johnson's protagonist - the product of an interracial union who ultimately de- cides to pass for white -is that he is equally adept at ragtime and Chopin. His unrealized dream was to write symphonic music based on ragtime and the old slave songs. Johnson's protagonist was, in effect, the fictional embodiment of Herder's folk ideology. While collecting folk material to transform into formal art, the name- less protagonist- a nominal prototype of Ellison's young hero in Invisible Man -encounters two legendary folk types: John Brown, the old preacher, and "Singing Johnson," the creator of spirituals. Both are impressive men, ingenious and eloquent in their respective arts. In the Preface to God's Trombones, seven sermons in verse, Johnson outlines the character and art of the folk preacher: The old-time Negro preacher of parts was above all an orator, and in good measure an actor. He knew the secret of oratory, that at bottom it is a progression of rhythmic words more than it is anything else. Indeed, I have witnessed congregations moved to ecstasy by the rhythmic intoning of sheer incoherencies. He was a master of all the modes of eloquence. He often possessed a voice that was a marvelous instrument, a voice he could modulate from a sepulchral whisper to a crashing thunder clap. His discourse was generally kept at a high pitch of fervency, but occasionally he dropped into colloquialisms and, less often, into humor. He preached a personal and ,anthropomorphic God, a sure-enough heaven and a red-hot hell. His imagination was bold 'and unfettered. He had the power to sweep his hearers before him; and so himself was often swept away. At such times his language was not prose but poetry.30 The folk preacher did not preach a formal sermon from a formal text; the text more often than not served as a starting point and frequently had no relation to the development of the sermon, which was intoned in an electrifying, rhythmic manner. A full description of "Singing Johnson" and the tradition of the black bards of old dominates the Preface to The Book of American Negro Spirituals (1925): 'Singing' Johnson is one of the indelible pictures on my mind. A small but stocky, dark-brown man was he, with one eye, and possess- ing a clear, strong high-pitched voice.... A maker of songs and a 30 (New York, 1969), p. 5.

'Singing' Johnson was of the line of the mightier bards of an earlier day, and he exemplified how they worked and how the Spirituals were 'composed.' These bards, I believe, made the original inventions of story and song, which in turn were influenced or modified by the group in action.81 This tradition, as we may recall, has a strong affinity to that advanced by Kittredge for ballad-making.32 It is also important to recall that in the Preface to The Book of American Negro Poetry (1922) Johnson advocates one of the most challenging approaches to folk art of his day. In an apparent attempt to reconcile the difference between folk art and high art, he argues that Afro-American folksongs represent a vast mine of material to be tapped by some genius of the race. Unlike many of his urbane contemporaries, Johnson affirmed the cultural values of the blues and jazz. By folksongs, he meant sacred and secular music, the spirituals and ragtime. (He seems to have used the latter term to designate a pot pourri of musical types, including work songs, blues, and jazz.)33 And the genius he extols is both national and international in character. The music created through the transmuting power of black artists would be not only the soul of their race, but the soul of America. "This power of the Negro to suck up the national spirit from the soil," Johson writes, "and create something artistic and original, which, at the same time, possesses the note of uni- versal appeal, is due to a remarkable racial gift of adaptability; it is more than adaptability, it is a transfusive quality. And the Negro has ex- ercised this transfusive quality not only here in America, where the race lives in large numbers, but in European countries, where the num- ber has been almost infinitesimal."34 The apparent contradiction here is resolved if we acknowledge the creative potentialities of the common man and the reality of the socially induced ethnic and nationalistic tensions mirrored in Afro-American poetry. The parallels between these ideas and Herder's cultural democracy and nationalism seem to me stronger than mere coincidence. Johnson's comments on the significance of an indigenous language are also related to Herder's views. Observing that the new Negro poets were not trying to break away from Negro dialect but from the limitations im- posed on it by the plantation and minstrel traditions, Johnson writes: 31 James Weldon Johnson and J. Rosamond Johnson, The Book of American Negro Spirituals (New York, 1969), p. 23. "2 See Rosenberg, The Art of the American Folk Preacher for an intriguing attempt to relate the spirituals and sermons to Albert B. Lord's formulaic theory of oral composition. M Johnson argued that ragtime was originated by colored piano players in the "questionable resorts" along the Mississippi River. "Once the text of all Ragtime songs was written in Negro dialect," he states, "and was about Negroes in the cabin or in the cotton field or on the levee or at a jubilee or on Sixth Avenue or at a ball, and about their love affairs. Today, only a small proportion of Ragtime songs relate at all to the Negro .... But that does not abolish in any way the claim of the American Negro as its originator."

He needs a form that is freer and larger than dialect, but which will still hold the racial flavcr; a form expressing the imagery, the idioms, the peculiar turns of thought, and the distinctive humor and pathos, too, of the Negro, but which will also be capable of voicing the deepest and highest emotions and aspirations, and allow- ing of the widest range of subjects and the widest scope of treatment.35 These ideas are by no means an indiscriminate, direct adoption of Herder's linguistic nationalism, but they do highlight the spiritual bond reflected in a distinctive linguistic form and urge its development. In the preceding paragraphs I have isolated what was common in the thoughts of the elder statesmen of the Harlem Renaissance in order to highlight their points of contact with, and divergence from, Herdian folk ideology. On the basis of their training, travels and writings, it is reasonable to infer that DuBois, Locke and Johnson were in tune with both the folk spirit of their age and the spirit of Herder's ideas on the relationship between folk art and formal art. 8 Ibid., pp. 41-42. 163</page></plain_text>
