<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION'" Benson Saler 1. Introduction In approaching the country that some call "the science of religion," I feel obliged to identify myself as a sympathetic alien. In light of cer tain of my research interests, moreover, I hasten to add that I am fully terrestrial. But my passport is from an anthropology department rather than from a department of religion. While anthropologists sometimes use the expression "science of reli gion," it is my impression that we more commonly talk about "the anthropology of religion." In doing so, we identify ourselves as anthro pologists with special interests in religion, just as other anthropologists have special interests in nutrition, law, economics, and so forth. In addition to resembling members of departments of religion by virtue of mutual interests in scholarly explorations of religion, anthro pologists of religion overlap with them in another way. That is, mem bers of both sorts of departments in the modern, secular academy recognize an obligation to bracket judgments about the truth-values of magico-religious claims (Wiebe 1988, 1990).2 In practice, however, schol ars in both groups sometimes resist or reject bracketing. Thus, for example, Evans-Pritchard relates much of his analysis in Witchcraft, 1 This essay is a revised version of a lecture presented at a conference spon sored by the Universities of Turku and Abo in April, 2000. I am grateful to Professor Veikko Anttonen and his colleagues at both universities for inviting me to Finland. 2 Some students of religion have gone well beyond minimalist commitments in that regard. Some have argued that magico-religious beliefs can only be properly understood within the context of the form of life that includes them, and were we to judge them true or false without such an understanding, we would be judging our own misunderstandings. Others have taken such a perspective even further. Maintaining that there are no transcendental, rational canons for truth and false hood that apply universally, they hold that truth and falsehood are authorized by discourses. Since there are no universal standards, and since discourses differ, it would be meretricious, they suggest, to assert unequivocal, public judgments respect ing the truth values of other people's magico-religious beliefs. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2004 Method &amp; Theoiy in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.brill.nl 16, 205-233</page><page sequence="2">206 BENSON SALER Oracles and Magic among the Azande (1937) to his explicitly declared assump tion that magic as such is false. And in his famous work, The Meaning and End of Religion (1962), Wilfred Cantwell Smith emphasizes what he calls the "impingement" of the Transcendent in human life, doubtlessly aware that for many of his readers, impingement implies an impinger. In any case, members of departments of religion and members of anthropology departments have engaged in lively debates in recent years about the nature, limitations, and possibilities of the scholarly study of religion. Both, indeed, have argued about whether or not their respec tive scholarly pursuits can be "science" in any acceptable, substantive sense of that term. In the past (and even to some extent today) such debates sometimes touched on considerations of "autonomy." But when they did, they tended to do so with this difference: numbers of anthropologists argued about whether or not culture may be said to be autonomous, while members of departments of religion raised a parallel argument about religion. This is a parallel argument, but, of course, a different argu ment. Among themselves, anthropologists did not usually engage in debates about the possible "autonomy" of religion because many of them deemed religion to be a sort of department or subdivision of cul ture. But some members of departments of religion, at least in Canada and the United States, explicitly raised the issue of the autonomy of religion. And, typically, advocates of a science of religion argued against the idea of autonomy. They sometimes did so in open opposition to those of their own academic colleagues who maintained that religion pivots on something that is irreducibly religious. While agreeing with those scholars in departments of religion who argue against the idea that religion is autonomous or "sui generis." and while sympathetic to their desire to develop and sustain a science of religion, I have some reservations about the accomplishments of some (but not all) of them to date. My reservations also apply to the publi cations of many (but not all) anthropologists who study religion. First, in my opinion, the outputs of both sorts of scholars of religion have not been as relevant to the findings of the sciences as they might have been (albeit I see signs of genuine—indeed, major—improvement in recent years). Second and closely related to the matter of relevance, numbers of scholars of religion, both anthropologists and others, have not always been as realistic as they might have been. I turn now to considerations of what I mean by being relevant and realistic.</page><page sequence="3">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 207 2. Being Relevant I begin with relevance. At the very outset of my remarks about it, I acknowledge the clear relevance of the academic study of religion to both the goals and much of the substance of liberal arts curricula in European and North American universities. Religion has played a diver sity of significant roles in much of human history. And, despite the predictions of the secularization hypothesis of some decades ago, reli gion continues to flourish throughout the world. For these reasons, his torical and comparative studies of religion are important not only for humanist scholars within the academy, but also for people outside of it who reflect seriously on the human condition. It is fitting, therefore, that the academy should recognize the significance of religion in human life by sheltering the study of it. But I am talking about the traditional locus of such study in the humanities. What of the call for a "science of religion"? It seems to me that Donald Wiebe and numbers of others among our contemporaries express relatively modest views when they cham pion a "science of religion." Basically, they advocate four things. First, they demand that the study of religion in secular universities be emancipated from theological advocacies or other insinuations of positive religious biases. Some go further in that they require that the scientific study of religion be unencumbered by social and political con cerns and involvements. As Wiebe put it at the 1997 Abo Symposium on Methodology in the Study of Religions: The task of the scientific student of religion as a scientist is not a moral or social one; it is merely to describe and explain as comprehensively as possible the phenomenon of religious behavior. If we are to avoid the decomposition of the academic study of religion into a pseudo-science we must leave broader Religious Studies—with its political and social agen das—to the humanists and religious devotees concerned with their place as public intellectuals in the life of society. (1999: 260-261) Second, proponents of the scientific study of religion advocate that some of the perspectives of scientists and philosophers of science, and cer tain of their standards or recommendations for doing scientific research, be adopted as guidelines by scholars of religion. Third, they incline to the view that the science of religion can seek in some sense to explain religious phenomena as distinct from "inter preting" such phenomena. Finally, and in consonance with the first three points, some propo nents of a science of religion recommend that the scientific study of</page><page sequence="4">208 BENSON SALER religion be deemed a social science. As a social science, it will have its own subject matter, but it will invoke relevant psychological and socio logical theories and constructs whenever it seems productive to do so. While I think that those ambitions constitute steps in the right direc tion, I judge them to be inadequate. I do so because the dominant traditional model in social sciences, such as cultural anthropology and sociology, is defective (see below).3 Among other things, it does not emphatically and consistently encourage students of religion to connect their findings and theorizing to the findings and theorizing of other sci ences, particularly the biological and cognitive sciences. Here and there, to be sure, we encounter statements such as one offered by Wiebe at Abo: that, as he puts it, "We need ... to estab lish more appropriate relations between our research and that of other established scientific fields. .(1999: 267). Wiebe, moreover, concludes his paper with what I deem a welcome suggestion: that "we need to reconsider the value of a return to evolutionary theory to re-establish a unifying framework for the study of religion" (1999: 269). Although I agree with his remarks, I wonder about their context. Wiebe and like-minded others seem to be advocating the creation of yet another discipline within the framework of the existing social sciences. They remind me to some extent of those of the elders of Israel who demanded of the prophet Samuel, "make us a king to judge us like all the nations" (First Samuel 8). The "nations" that Wiebe and his cohort would join, however, have recendy been subjected to some adverse judgments. I refer to criticisms made of the social sciences in general by John Tooby, an anthropologist, and Leda Cosmides, a psychologist, in a jointly authored, long essay entitled "The Psychological Foundations of Culture" (1992). I deem those criticisms to be cogent and arresting. I think, moreover, that they apply to what seems to be envisioned by some proponents—and de facto practitioners—of a science of religion (as well as applying to legions of anthropologists engaged in the anthro pology of religion). They do not apply, however, to the theorizing of those students of religion who affiliate themselves with the contempo rary cognitive and evolutionary sciences. Some of these, in my opin 3 Some anthropologists and sociologists reject the idea that members of their disciplines should aspire to science. Instead of attempting to explain cultural phe nomena, they hold, we should furnish "thick descriptions" and cogent interpreta tions. Others, however, call for theorizing that incorporates or emphasizes causality. 1 am concerned here with the dominant model that traditionally has guided the latter set of social scientists.</page><page sequence="5">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 209 ion, have already taken important steps in the creation of a truly excit ing science of religion (I shall say more about this later). Tooby and Cosmides are judicious in their examination of what they call "The Standard Social Science Model." They find elements of truth in it. They acknowledge, moreover, that that model would not have become as influential as it is if it did not impress many persons as being plausible and anchored in reality (1992: 33). At the same time, however, they think that it suffers from some major defects. In conse quence of those defects, they argue, the Standard Social Science Model seems to make the social sciences autonomous from the rest of science (1992: 33). Such apparent isolation, they opine, is regrettable, and eman cipation from the traditional model would be a positive good. They recommend efforts to replace the Standard Social Science Model with what they call "integrated theory." An integrated theory, as they char acterize it, is "one framed so that it is compatible with data and the ory from other relevant fields" (1992: 44). The Standard Social Science Model What is The Standard Social Science Model? As Tooby and Cosmides characterize it, it is founded on, and seeks to deal with, observations of cultural and behavioral similarities within human groups and obser vations of cultural and behavioral differences between human groups. Contemporary social scientists correctly maintain that neither cultural similarities nor cultural differences can be explained by discrete and variable racial or genetic factors in human populations. All normal human infants everywhere enjoy much the same biological endowment, an endowment that makes possible a human level of existence. Biological factors as such do not determine which particular language people will speak or in which particular culture they participate. Unfortunately, Tooby and Cosmides aver, while social scientists cor rectly maintain that the common biological endowment of normal human infants is everywhere a constant, many of them impose erro neous suppositions on that understanding. They hold that human nature is a constant, and as such it cannot explain a variable, the observed diversity of cultures. As the young of the human species develop, social scientists generally suppose, they must acquire what leads to differences among them, and they must acquire it from sources outside of them selves. They must acquire it, that is, from extra-genetic, extra-somatic sources: from socio-cultural, not biological, sources. In the Standard</page><page sequence="6">2 10 BENSON SALER Social Science Model, socio-cultural factors in effect create the indi vidual and largely determine adult mental organization. The social scientists who argue this way usually acknowledge that human nature—which Tooby and Cosmides identify as "the evolved architecture of the human mind" (1992: 28)—is a necessary condition for the cultural organization of human life. But they otherwise deny significant causal powers to it in accounting for cultural diversity. Many agree with Emile Durkheim's assertion that human nature is "merely the indeterminate material that the social factor molds and transforms" (quoted by Tooby and Cosmides 1992: 28). Or, adopting a more con temporary idiom, they suppose, as does Clifford Geertz (1973: 35), that the human mind is a sort of general purpose computer that requires the downloading of cultural programs if it is to operate in a discernibly human way. And, in a distant parallel to Mircea Eliade, the anthro pologist Robert Lowie stoudy proclaims that "Culture is a thing sui generis which can be explained only in terms of itself. . . Omnis cultura ex cultura" (quoted in Tooby and Cosmides 1992: 28). The Standard Social Science Model, Tooby and Cosmides (1992: 28) point out, "removes from the concept of human nature all substantive content, and relegates the architecture of the human mind to the delim ited role of embodying :the capacity for culture'." Even emotions such as sexual jealousy or paternal love, they note, are accounted to be cul tural products. This viewpoint has nurtured all sorts of ancillary ideas, including, among others, both assumptions and problematics relating to the specifics of culture and the ways in which it is transmitted from generation to generation. It nurtures, for example, the assignment of importance to learning theory in psychology (with a concomitant rel ative neglect of other topical concerns in that discipline), the notion that the mind-brain is a general purpose processor (rather than an assemblage of domain specific modules), and the prepossessing idea that the evolution of our capacity for culture has endowed our species with an enormous potentiality for behavioral flexibility, a flexibility that is ultimately constrained by culture itself. Tooby and Cosmides call our attention to some specific defects in the Standard Social Science Model. For one thing, they write, its cen tral logic rests on naïve and erroneous concepts drawn from outmoded theories of development. For example, the fact that some aspect of adult mental orga nization is absent at birth has no bearing on whether it is part of our evolved architecture. Just as teeth or breasts are absent at birth, and yet appear through maturation, evolved psychological mechanisms or mod</page><page sequence="7">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 21 1 ules (complex structures that are functionally organized for processing) could develop at any point in the life cycle. For this reason, the many features of adult mental organization absent at birth need not be attrib uted to exposure to transmitted culture, but may come about through a large number of causal avenues not considered in traditional analyses. (1992: 33) For another thing, Tooby and Cosmides maintain, the Standard Social Science Model "rests on a faulty analysis of nature-nurture issues, stem ming from a failure to appreciate the role that the evolutionary process plays in organizing the relationship between our species-universal genetic endowment, our evolved developmental processes, and the recurring features of developmental environments" (1992: 33, emphasis added). They go on to say that the critique of the standard model "that has been emerging from the cognitive and evolutionary communities" is not simply the charge that proponents of that model have underesti mated the importance of biological factors in human life. Rather, the target of criticism "is the whole framework that assumes that 'biologi cal factors' and 'environmental factors' refer to mutually exclusive sets of causes that exist in some kind of explanatory zero-sum relation ship . .." (1992: 33). Perhaps an even more devastating criticism is this: Tooby and Cosmides write: The Standard Social Science Model requires an impossible psychology. Results out of cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology, artificial intelli gence, developmental psychology, linguistics, and philosophy converge on the same conclusion: A psychological architecture that consisted of noth ing but equipotential, general-purpose, or content-free mechanisms could not successfully perform the tasks the human mind is known to perform or solve . . . from seeing, to learning a language, to recognizing an emotional expression, to selecting a mate, to the many disparate activities aggregated under the term "learning culture" . . . It cannot account for the behavior observed, and it is not a type of design that could have evolved. (1992: 34, emphases added) Without going any further into the particulars of the criticisms voiced by Tooby and Cosmides, suffice it to say that there is enough wrong with the Standard Social Science Model as to render it a dubious model for the science of religion. Its celebration of the imputed autonomy and power of culture nurtures close-ended hermeneutical and/or func tionalist studies that have little or no cumulative payoff. As a paradigm for research and theorizing, moreover, the Standard Social Science Model serves to isolate many social scientists from exciting develop ments in contemporary philosophy, the cognitive sciences and linguis tics, the neural sciences, evolutionary biology, and developmental and</page><page sequence="8">212 BENSON SALER evolutionary psychology. Indeed, the business-as-usual and almost exclu sive emphasis on culture, ironically enough, works to inhibit the emer gence of balanced and warrantable understandings of culture. As the cognitive anthropologist Roy D'Andrade (1995: 216) puts it, :'many anthropologists believe culture does just about everything. . . But cul ture does not really do everything. The effect of culture is greatly exag gerated by many anthropologists. So far as we know, no cultural particulars are needed for humans everywhere to do modus ponens, or remember the color of apples, or perceive that a hawk is different than a handsaw." A major, promising alternative view to that championed by the Standard Social Science Model is characterized in these words by Tooby and Cosmides (1992: 34): Human psychological architecture contains many evolved mechanisms that are specialized for solving evolutionarily long-enduring adaptive problems and . . . these mechanisms have content-specialized representational for mats, procedures, cues, and so on. These richly content-sensitive evolved mechanisms tend to impose certain types of content and conceptual orga nization on human mental life and, hence, strongly shape the nature of human social life and what is transmitted across generations. Towards Relevance How may the science of religion position itself with respect to the promises of that alternative view? How, indeed, may it render its research and theorizing compatible with, and complementary to, the research and theorizing of other sciences concerned with the human condition, and by so doing make itself more relevant to those sciences? I think that there are a number of things that it can and should do. I limit myself here to advocating three of them. First, the science of religion ought to be clear about the phenome nal subjects of its research. Those subjects, in my opinion, are not reli gions or cultures. Rather, they are human beings. Religion and culture are constructs that we associate with human beings. The emerging sci ence of religion already views religion as a human creation, and we need to expand our knowledge of human beings if we are to expand our knowledge of why and how they go about creating religions. To borrow an insight from theologians, a global perspective on creatures requires some understanding of their creator. Second, the science of religion ought to address the most interest ing and important questions that we can ask about religion. Namely:</page><page sequence="9">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 213 What should we mean by "religion?" Why are there religions? How are they organized and transmitted? In what ways do religions resem ble one another and in what ways do they differ? And why do many people continue to invest themselves in religion whereas others distance themselves from it or actively attempt to debunk it? Third, and in consonance with the above recommendations, the sci ence of religion should be explicitly affiliated with the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. This does not mean that it would exclude descrip tive or experimental studies that are outside of self-consciously cogni tive and/or evolutionary frames. Descriptions, however, are observations that have been selected, organized, and re-worked, and as such they are inevitably theory-laden. As Popper (1962) cogently argues, obser vations are perceptions that have been prepared by biases or, broadly put, by theories. Experiments, moreover, are normally organized to test hypotheses, and they are thus exercises in the service of theories. What I advocate, therefore, is that the dominant questions that frame the science of religion, and the methodological and theoretical weightings that identify it, be relevant to, informed by, and contributory to, work in the contemporary cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The Cognitive Approach Eschewing "superorganic" cultures, disembodied "social facts," and suprapersonal "structures" of appropriateness, contemporary cognitive studies take human beings as their phenomenal subjects, especially as they credit those subjects with mind-brains. Religion, in a manner of speaking, bubbles up from the mind-brain. Many (perhaps most) contemporary students of religion who espouse cognitive approaches endorse what has come to be known as the mod ular theory of mind (Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994). That is, the mind brain is envisioned as including a number of different "modules" or "intelligences." These are evolved and varied mental structures that are sensitive, respectively, to different sorts of inputs that stem from our perceptual machinery and/or the outputs of other modules. They are disposed, moreover, to process information in determinate ways. It is hypothesized, for example, that while some module(s) may be engaged mainly with language disposition and acquisition, others are primarily involved with mathematical skills, or agent detection, or tropic figurations, and so on. Our conceptual and inferential systems, in this view, are modu larly funded, and as such not everything goes. The mind-brain is not</page><page sequence="10">214 BENSON SALER content free, and our concepts and inferences are disposed in certain ways, regardless of our culture. The mind-brain, moreover, is not uncon strained, and neither are our concepts and inferences. Since religion relates to our conceptual and inferential propensities, we do not find in actuality certain imaginable kinds of religion (Boyer 1994, 2001), just as language users do not normally make certain imaginable kinds of syntactical errors. We humans, cognitive students of religion maintain, enjoy a num ber of capacities, dispositions, and processing capabilities that originally had, and that still have, adaptive significance. Thus, by way of three examples: we have agent-detection sensitivities (useful not only in social relations with conspecifics but also in monitoring the world for real and imagined dangers); we can imagine virtual realities (which allows us both to envision future what-if scenarios and to account in one way or another for the past); and we have meta-representational abilities that we employ in attempting to understand and predict the behavior of others. Such capacities, propensities, and processual capabilities, as Boyer (2004) argues, would be with us regardless of whether or not we have religion. They underwrite multiple domains of human life and religion is among their derivatives. Thus, by way of a very brief (and simplified) effort at illustration, our agent-detector sensitivities, coupled with our capacities and dispositions to imagine virtual realities, may lead us to infer and conceptualize non-existent beings of the sort that students of religion call gods. And our meta-representational capacities and propen sities may support the attribution of will, desire, and purpose to those imagined gods by persons who deem them real. Acknowledgment of the derivative nature of religion raises problems for the explanation of religion. It cannot suffice either to rely on reli gious people for sufficient leads or to rely on the constructs of arm chair theorists. Cogent and persuasive explanations of religion must depend on bringing to light the mental structures that underwrite reli gion and much else in human life, and it is unlikely that questioning religious people or closely reading the classical literature will do that. That is why numbers of cognitive students of religion have designed and executed various experiments. Not all experimenters, by the way, are psychologists. Anthropologists such as Scott Atran and Pascal Boyer, and humanists-turned-scientists such as Ukka Pyysiáinen, have resorted to experiments in order to test hypotheses and so better understand why we have religion. This does not mean that future fieldwork, or survey research, or textual analysis, or many other traditional avenues</page><page sequence="11">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 215 of scholarship are to be ruled out. It does mean, however, that a truly scientific study of religion is unashamedly reductive (Boyer 2004), and that it will make sense of the fruits of other research by relating them to cognitive (and perhaps eventually neural) processes. Evolution Our descriptive and experimental studies could benefit by relating to evolutionary theory for at least two reasons. First, since religions are human creations, our understanding of them (as I suggested earlier) will be advanced by a greater knowledge of their creators, and a global understanding and appreciation of the human condition requires a phy logenetic perspective (Hallowell 1960). Second, Darwinian (or, if you prefer, Neo-Darwinian) theory is supported by a great deal of empir ical evidence, it is underwritten by sound logic, and it is powerful in that it is used to explain much. Now, evolutionary interests were in evidence among some 19th cen tury students of religion. Their ways of addressing and expressing those interests, however, eventually displeased later students of religion. Evans Pritchard (1965), for example, dismissed Edward Burnett Tylor's intel lectualist and evolutionary theorizing as summing to a "Just-So" story. Today, however, we are in a better position to support an evolu tionary perspective and shelter the science of religion under it. We benefit from a much more sophisticated understanding of evolution than that enjoyed by our 19th century predecessors. This better under standing rests on a host of developments. They include (but are not limited to): the creation of new disciplines such as genetics and mole cular biology and the flourishing of organic chemistry, paleontology, and evolutionary biology; advances in the cognitive and neural sciences; the development of increasingly sophisticated mathematical and statis tical techniques (as in population genetics and in numbers of other fields); the use of electronic computers for handling large amounts of data; new discoveries in paleoanthropology and the rise and promise of cognitive archeology; and, after some mixed reviews for sociobiol ogy, the florescence of evolutionary psychology. Perhaps the most important evolutionary question a student of reli gion may ask is this: Did religion evolve? No, Scott Atran (2002) answers, because there neither is nor was an "it" to have evolved. Religion, as I (Saler 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000a [1993], 2000b) argue in a non-essentialist vein, is a variable congeries of different elements and not some specific</page><page sequence="12">2 16 BENSON SALER this or that. The elements that we associate with religion did not all evolve together; rather, they arose as spandrels in the evolution of cer tain capacities and dispositions that offered adaptive advantages. Religion, Boyer (2001, 2004) points out, is parasitic on different evolved adap tive capacities and propensities that, quite apart from religion, play important roles in sustaining human life. Given the understandings outlined above, it follows that the evolu tionary studies that are most immediately relevant to the science of religion are those that illumine, and that seek in some sense to account for, the emergence of the cognitive capacities and dispositions that sup port religion. But, as claimed above, such capacities and dispositions support much else, and they did not originally emerge because of their importance to religion. These views are fundamental to an important book published by the archeologist Steven Mithen (1996) and appro priately entitled The Prehistory of the Mind. The encompassing nature of that study, already affirmed by the title, is reinforced by the subtitle: The cognitive origins of art, religion and science,4 Mithen incorporates some of his findings into a later and more par ticularized paper entitled "Symbolism and the Supernatural" (1999), and it is worth citing here some of what he says in that essay by way of further supporting the recommendation that the science of religion incorporate an evolutionary dimension. "Symbolism and the Supernatural" Mithen holds that ideas about the supernatural can be anchored in the mind with the help of material artifacts, and that without such anchor age religious institutions and thought about the supernatural would be severely constrained (1999: 148). Archeologists, of course, are profes sionally motivated and trained to unearth and analyze material arti facts, and so, among other things, to look for material symbols that might promote religious conceptualizations (1999: 150). In surveying the archeological record both in the 1996 book and in the later paper, Mithen comes to conclusions that some may regard as surprising. Contrary to the supposition that religious thought is ancient in our genus, Mithen claims that "the archeological evidence suggests 4 That subtitle is given on the title page of the paperback edition in my possession. The cover of that edition, however, does not include religion in the subtitle.</page><page sequence="13">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 217 that religious ideas and ritual activities appeared relatively recently in human prehistory" (1999: 151). While archaic members of the genus Homo appeared in the fossil record 2.5 million years ago, our first unambiguous (albeit slight) evidence for religious rituals is not more than 100,000 years old (1999: 151). That evidence comes from buri als where animal remains were interred with human dead. But evi dence of manufactured or artificially made symbols suggests that religion is no earlier than perhaps 30,000 years ago (1999: 151). Mithen thinks it likely that religious beliefs arose as "mental span drels," that is, as originally non-adaptive by-products of other, adaptive cognitive developments (1999: 157). He hypothesizes a "proto-symbol ism" among our ancestors in the Upper Paleolithic (1999: 153-154). Prior to some 60,000 to 30,000 years ago, he conjectures, early human ancestors had at least three specialized cognitive domains, to whit, intelligences concerned with material objects, with living entities, and with the human social world. While each of these domains may have facilitated discrete or specialized complexities (such as Nean derthal skills in producing levallois flakes and points) (1999: 158), early humans did not connect skills facilitated by one domain with skills facilitated by other domains (1999: 159). Mithen thinks it likely that that was because "their thoughts about the social, natural, and tech nical worlds were quite isolated from each other" (1999: 159). Eventually, however, Mithen suggests, there was a transition to what he calls "cognitive fluidity" (1999: 159), where the different domains penetrated and supported one another. That transition was of immense evolutionary significance. The integration of the three kinds of intelli gence facilitated not only the design of new hunting weapons, but also the production of artifacts such as beads and necklaces that conveyed social messages (1999: 159). Mithen supposes Homo sapiens sapiens to have attained greater "cognitive fluidity" than Neanderthals, and that that achievement was a major factor in accounting for the replacement of the latter by the former. Mithen applies these claims to the development of religious ideas and their expression and anchorage in material artifacts. Drawing on Pascal Boyer's (1994) emphasis on the distinction between intuitive and counter-intuitive ontologies, and Stewart Guthrie's (1993) treatment of anthropomorphism, Mithen suggests that cognitive fluidity makes pos sible the combining of the intuitive and the counter-intuitive and the anthropomorphizing of animals by attributing to them human-like intel ligence, will, and purpose. Such combinations and attributions, he argues, need not have any adaptive value. Indeed, these and other</page><page sequence="14">2 18 BENSON SALER religious ideas can be non-adaptive or even mal-adaptive. But what ever their possible cost, that cost is "more than compensated for by the benefits of cognitive fluidity gained from other types of thinking" (1999: 160). Now, Mithen's thesis has a certain plausibility to it. And, when eval uated against the artifactual evidence for it, it is a brilliant demon stration of how archeologists can sometimes make much out of relatively little. While decidedly speculative, it does, however, have three things in its favor. First, it takes account of the actual material evidence avail able. That evidence clearly confronts us with puzzles. Artifacts thus far unearthed indicate that for hundreds of thousands of years our early tool-making ancestors were decidedly "conservative," turning out much the same crude tools year after year. Then, rather suddenly, there was a florescence of new types of tools and, necessarily, new techniques for producing them. Why? Mithen supposes that something in the nature of a cognitive revolution must have occurred. Second, Mithen takes account of a large and diverse literature on the nature of the mind, and he selectively and adroitly applies that literature to solving some archeological puzzles. Third, he attempts to account for the emergence of religion by relating it both to the material evidence in hand and to some powerful theories of religion offered by contemporary cognitive students of religion. In my opinion, he deserves our admiration on all three counts, even if he does not fully persuade us. Now, at first glance, Mithen's approach may seem to clash with that of one of my teachers, Anthony F. C. Wallace. I think, however, that those approaches can be productively related to one another and that both should be taken into account by the science of religion. Anthony F. C. Wallace Wallace was fond of telling his students that if they were to seek the origins of religion, they should look not to the Paleolithic but to their daily newspapers. That is because, he continued, religion originates again and again in human history. Because it does, he held, it becomes possible through ethnographic, historical, and comparative research to identify the typical conditions under which religions emerge. We can hope, indeed, to develop a model of religion's usual patterns of emer gence and development, and to hypothesize relevant explanatory mech anisms that might account for components of the model. In consonance with those convictions, as some of you may know, Wallace (1956b)</page><page sequence="15">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 219 offers us his model of "revitalization movements." Drawing, moreover, on Pavlov's work on ultraparadoxical reactions, on Selye's work on stress and The General Adaptation Syndrome, and on much else, he adumbrates the mechanism of "mazeway resynthesis." Wallace's major paper on mazeway resynthesis (1956a), be it noted, is subtitled "A Biocultural Theory of Religious Inspiration." Wallace more or less assumes the existence of the cognitive capaci ties and propensities the emergence of which Mithen seeks to trace in the archeological record. That is why I think that the different approaches of these two scholars are sequentially compatible. There is, moreover, a larger lesson to be drawn from that compatibility. Part of the work of the science of religion, in tandem with other sciences, is to under stand the emergence and nature of the cognitive capacities that under write religion. And in illuminating the possibilities and limitations of those capacities, we provide other scholars with powerful tools for bet ter understanding the careers of religions mentioned in their daily news papers. 3. Being Realistic I have devoted most of this essay to sketching some of my views on the matter of relevance. Now I turn to the related challenge of ren dering the science of religion more realistic. I do not employ "realis tic" in any formal philosophical sense. Rather, I use it in its common and idealized acceptations: that is, as having to do with accommoda tions to facts and to good arguments and a corresponding disinclina tion to accept the fanciful and the illogical. The place to start, I think, is with our understandings of language. More particularly, we may start with a realistic appreciation of lan guage's limitations. The most important of those limitations as they relate to the study of religion is language's lack of full transparency in communicating thought and in representing the world. There are sev eral reasons for why that is the case. Thus, for instance, structural requirements internal to any system of signs constrain the arbitrariness of expressive vehicles if meaning combinations are to be predictable from sign combinations; language, in consequence, cannot be internally cohesive as well as fully transparent to the meanings it expresses (Parmentier 1985: 372). For another thing, we humans are prone to expand our understandings analogically, and analogical expansions moti vate tropes. We must reckon with the fact that our uses render many</page><page sequence="16">220 BENSON SALER of the terms that we employ polysemous (i.e., a given term takes on different meanings, though those meanings are systematically related to one another).5 Terms, moreover, are likely to be loaded with conno tations, and sensitivities (or insensitivities) to connotations may vary among members of a speech community. For these and other reasons, the goal of a tidy and strictly neutral scientific language would seem to be unrealistic, especially when it comes to the study of human affairs. The conceit that students of the human condition can systematically and consensually employ one term for one thing is not supportable, either historically or in principle. What are we to do? We can endorse some realistic suggestions offered by the philosopher Karl Popper (1962). We should strive not for utter or exhaustive precision in specifying what may be meant by our ana lytical terms but for serviceable clarity in explicating how they are used. In attempting to implement Popper's suggestion, some plain talk about categories and concepts can be useful. "Categorization," the psy chologist Douglas Medin writes, "involves treating two or more distinct entities as in some way equivalent in the service of accessing knowl edge and making predictions... a concept is an idea that includes all that is characteristically associated with it. A category is a partitioning or class to which some assertion or set of assertions might apply" (1989: 1469, emphases in original). Categories, in brief, are classificatory devices. As such, they relate to other categories, other classificatory devices, in larger classificatory struc tures. Categories, moreover, express, and may be motivated by, knowl edge and theories about the world, including knowledge and theories about what counts as meaningful resemblances. Altering what we may mean by some category—religion, say—is therefore not as easy or as unconstrained as some may suppose although, of course, history teaches us that categories and larger classificatory structures do change. Apposite to the subject matter of this essay is the category religion. Numbers of students of religion have remarked on the contested nature of the category. Because some of them deem definitional issues to be crucial for marking out an area of study, I will center the rest of this essay on that subject. A realistic "science of religion," many will agree, requires a realistic explication of "religion." 5 If the different meanings were not systematically related to one another, we would encounter homonomy, not polysemy.</page><page sequence="17">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 221 A Few Examples of Approaches to the Definitional Problem Many persons have sought to define religion by specifying putative "dis tinctive features,"6 features represented to be both necessary and sufficient for identifying instances of the category (see Saler 2000 [1993]: 87-157 for criticisms of a diversity of examples). A smaller number of authors have advocated an anti-essentialist "family resemblance" approach to defining religion, but some of them have subverted their own recom mendations in ways that suggest essentialist recidivism (e.g., Peter Byrne 1988: 7, 9; see Fitzgerald 1996: 227 and Saler 1999: 393-394 for some criticisms of Byrne). Other scholars have advocated, for one reason or another, that we jettison the category and category label. W. C. Smith (1962), for exam ple, recommends that we substitute "cumulative traditions" and "faith" for "religion." Timothy Fitzgerald (1996, 1997, 2000), penning an even more radical set of suggestions, would have us do away not only with the category but also with departments of religion or religious studies as presendy constituted; he advocates that such departments be con verted into departments of cultural studies dedicated to the exploration of values and power realities. A concern with "power" also animates much of Talal Asad's 1983 essay, "Anthropological Conceptions of Religion: Reflections on Geertz," an essay well received by numbers of anthropologists. Asad does not advocate that we do away with the term and category religion. But because of an unfortunate incoherence in his argument, he in effect turns the category into one that might more appropriately be labeled "je ne sais quoi." Asad maintains the following: (1) Clifford Geertz's famous 1966 characterization of religion, one that emphasizes mean ing and general order, is a privatized, "Christian" conception of reli gion and is unsuitable as a cross-cultural analytical category. (2) Many anthropologists have operated with similar conceptions of religion, and they would do well to purge themselves of such conceptions in light of the criticisms made of Geertz. (3) Instead of addressing the ques tions about meaning that Geertz favored in 1966, students of religion 6 I prefer the expression "distinguishing features" to the more commonly employed "distinctive features." The latter is more likely than the former to suggest charac teristics or qualities that are independent of human judgments. "To distinguish," in contrast, implies the interposition of human agency in simultaneous acts of iden tifying and classifying.</page><page sequence="18">222 BENSON SALER should address this question: how does power create religion? Asad, however, fails to bridge a rather daunting gap between his first two points and the third. That is, if we truly purged our minds of Geertz like conceptions of religion, conceptions that (allegedly) have hitherto guided us, don't we need some new conception if we are going to study how "power" creates "religion?" Asad, alas, fails to supply any thing in the way of a substitute. And so, in the end, he in effect rec ommends that we study how power creates je ne sais quoi (or something equivalently vacuous). In that we have touched on considerations of "power," it seems rel evant to consider an assertion that, if accepted at face value, would greatly empower scholars. I refer to a statement made by Jonathan Z. Smith: "'Religion' is not a native term; it is a term created by schol ars for their intellectual purposes and therefore is theirs to define" (1998: 281). While I do not accept that statement as it stands, it can be reduced to the making of a sustainable point: that scholars have some options in defining religion. Scholars, however, are not the only people who talk about religion. Nor are they the only ones who sometimes raise questions about the meaning of the term. To restrict our purview to contemporary American society, there are, for example, the courts that interpret and general ize constitutional restrictions on the Congress respecting the establish ment and prohibition of religion. And then there are various federal, state, and local agencies that require standard conceptions of religion for some of their routine work (e.g., in granting tax exemptions, adher ing to zoning rules, and so forth). And, for that matter, there are also radio and television "talking heads," barbers and pastry chefs, mafia dons and copy editors, priests, ministers, rabbis, and imams, and all the other millions and millions of native or naturalized Americans who use the word "religion" and who occasionally venture explications of it. In actuality, while scholars have options when it comes to talking about religion, they are also constrained if they would communicate with one another and with a larger audience. And that's where being realistic could improve matters. Some Realistic Considerations Religion, the anthropologist Melford E. Spiro notes, "is a term with historically rooted meanings" (1966: 91). Because of that, Spiro opines, "a definition must satisfy not only the criterion of cross-cultural applic</page><page sequence="19">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 223 ability but also the criterion of intra-cultural intuitivity; at the least, it should not be counter-intuitive" (1966: 91). Religion is indeed a term with "historically rooted meanings." And its history is decidedly complex. Furthermore, as numbers of scholars have noted, many non-Western populations lack traditional terms and categories that approximate to terms and categories for "religion" in the contemporary West. Euro-Americans, however, have exported—in some cases imposed—conceptions of religion, and vocabularies for talk ing about it, throughout the globe. The emergence of modern Western conceptions of religion is related in multiplex ways to the Reformation and accompanying wars and per secutions, the influx of information from the New World and the desires of Europeans to classify and assimilate that information, the Enlighten ment and the rise of deism, the developments of capitalism and colo nialism, the florescence of secular scholarly studies, and still more. Today, "religion" is a widely diffused popular term and category in Euro-American societies. Scholars have appropriated both, and num bers of them have sought to refine, reform, or reinvent the category (only a minority, insofar as I am aware, express themselves in favor of doing away with it). Efforts at scholarly refinement, reform, or rein vention often involve some distancing from popular uses, but largely in attempts to foreground what, in the variegated opinions of scholars, may be most noteworthy, salient, or important about religion. Scholarly interests in religion, nevertheless, relate in great measure to the fact that religion has been, and remains, a matter of interest and concern in Euro-American societies. However distanced scholarly applications of the term religion may become from popular applications, it is unlikely that they will break entirely with them. Maintaining universes of discourse is important not only within scholarly communities but also between such communities and the larger societies that support them. And here is where one of the major problems in religious studies lies. Prototypical Exemplars As I suggest elsewhere (Saler 2000 [1993]), for many Euro-Americans, those large families of religion that are popularly denominated 'Judaism" and "Christianity" constitute the most prototypical exemplars of religion. I employ "prototype" in the sense described by the psychologist Eleanor Rosch (1978: 36): "By prototypes of categories, we have generally meant</page><page sequence="20">224 BENSON SALER the clearest cases of category membership defined operationally by peo ple's judgments of goodness of membership in the category."7 The judg ment that "Judaism" and "Christianity" are prototypical poses a serious but not insurmountable problem for the prescription of a scholarly ana lytical category. "Judaism" and "Christianity" constitute peculiar developments when compared, say, to traditional religions in highland New Guinea or low land South America. They have published canons, articulated creeds, and accreted theological literatures, for example, and these were facil itated by a host of distinct economic, organizational, and technologi cal developments. Man)' contributors to the developing theologies of those religions, moreover, found stimulation, positive and negative, in intellectual traditions originating outside of distinctly Jewish or Christian religious frames (e.g., in the panoplies of classical Greek and Hellenistic thought). Coming to understand religion on the basis of cases that many Euro Americans deem the most prototypical exemplars of the category can have—and has had—some unfortunate consequences (I furnish an exam ple from lowland South .America in Saler forthcoming). As Pascal Boyer puts it, The focus on what we are familiar with—those highly doctrinal phe nomena people call "world religions"—is the source of many a confused view about religion. For instance, it is in my experience exceedingly difficult to convince most people . . . that most religion is not about the creation of the world, that it is rarely about God, that it is very seldom about the salvation of the soul. More important and more difficult to impress upon most people: most religion has no doctrine, no set catalogue of beliefs that most members should adhere to, no overall and integrated statements about supernatural agents. Most religion is piecemeal, mostly implicit, often less than perfectly consistent and, most importantly, focused on con crete circumstances. (Boyer 2004: 28, emphasis in original) "Doctrinal" or so-called "world" or "organized" religions, Boyer (2004: 29) argues, do not displa.ce non-doctrinal religions but supplement them. They manifest an "additional growth." As such, they constitute "a sec 7 A great deal of research has demonstrated that people often judge some instan tiations of a category to be "clearer" or "better" exemplars than others. Thus, for example, some English speakers judge robins to be clearer exemplars of the cate gory "bird" than penguins, and chair to be a better exemplar of "furniture" than radio. Disparities in judgments rendered have been called "prototype effects" (see, for example, Lakoff 1987).</page><page sequence="21">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 225 ondary, derivative development of a much more general and deeply human tendency to imagine important supernatural agents and to enter tain precise descriptions of their powers" (2004: 28). One must under stand this "general mental disposition," Boyer maintains, in order to understand much about "the special case" of religion as exemplified by so-called world religions (2004: 28). Yet many students of religion, Boyer notes, have used doctrinal religions as a starting point in the attempt "to climb all the way up to a general understanding of reli gion in human kind," and doing so "was not always very successful" (2004: 28). I agree with much of what Boyer says in the citations given above. I wish, however, that he had expressed himself differently when he sug gests that because the foregoing is the case, .. the dull business of demarcating what is "religion" from what is not is better left to lexi cographers; it should not unduly trouble scholars. Whether accounts of religion are of interest depends, not on where they place its bound aries but on how they account for the observed behavior they purport to explain" (Boyer 2004: 27). Boyer is clearly operating with a con cept of religion. Elsewhere, indeed, he tells us much about it (e.g., Boyer 2001). In the passage quoted, however, he appears to slight inter est in specifying (and justifying) that concept in favor of emphasizing the importance of good explanation. Inasmuch as this essay is concerned with developing a science of religion, I will outline what I prefer to mean by "religion." Before doing so, however, it may prove useful to take another look at "doc trinal" religion as a starting place for coming to understand religion. Such a starting place, it should be noted, can be problematic not only for understanding "traditional" religions, but also for understanding what occurs among the adherents of doctrinal religions. Many Christians, for example, are not very knowledgeable about Christian doctrines as described in textbooks or theological tracts. Or, even when knowl edgeable, some reject various doctrines. Numbers of them, indeed, evince ideas, norms, and behaviors that are given little or no public endorsement by "mainstream" Christian theologians and church leaders. Many field anthropologists, nevertheless, identify what they take to be religion in non-Western societies by finding analogies to what they deem to be "religion" at home. Given our intellectual propensities to assimilate new information, at least initially, by relating it to established representations and theories, that is hardly surprising. While this can sometimes conduce to errors, I do not think that it always does. Intelligence and hard work—and enough time in the field to maximize</page><page sequence="22">226 BENSON SALER their possibilities—have often overcome initial bias. We can now, more over, enhance prospects for realistic descriptions of religions by insti tuting safeguards derived from cognitive approaches. One very important safeguard is the recognition that "doctrinal" religions do not displace or obviate more general and widespread religious proclivities, even among declared adherents of "doctrinal" religions. Another is the under standing that because "doctrinal" religions show us what may become of more general religion under certain circumstances, they have to be selectively discounted as templates in the study of other religions. Categories and Categorization A science of religion, in my opinion, needs to consider what psychol ogists, philosophers, linguists, and others have learned and proposed about categories and categorization. That is, we need to consider such matters as they may apply to us as analysts, in addition to consider ing what they may purport for the people we study. One might, for example, expand on what Coleman and Kay (1981: 27) describe as ". . . the obvious pretheoretical intuition that semantic categories fre quently have blurry edges and allow degrees of membership." And one might also explore Wittgenstein's insight: that, as Rosch (1978: 36) describes it, "we can judge how clear a case something is and deal with categories on the basis of clear cases in the total absence of infor mation about boundaries." In an old and idealized approach to categorization, the members of a group comprehended by a category—the instantiations of the cate gory—are viewed as fully and equally members by virtue of sharing in common one or more "distinctive features." Those features define the category and serve as standards for admission. This understanding works in the case of some categories (e.g., "triangle"). It is unsatisfactory, how ever, where some of the instances labeled by a term appear to have little or nothing in common with some of the other instances labeled by that same term. In the case of "game," for instance, what distinc tive features does solitaire share with baseball? In this case, the philoso pher Wittgenstein advises, "Don't say: "There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'"—but look and see whether there is anything common to all.—For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that" (Philosophical Investigations 1.66, emphasis in original). Games, Wittgenstein says, "form a family" (.Philosophical</page><page sequence="23">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 227 Investigations 1.67), and they are linked together by "a complicated net work of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail" (.Philosophical Investigations 1.66). Wittgenstein adds that he "can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than 'family resemblances'" (1.67). (Witt genstein, by the way, did not invent the expression "family resemblances." It or similar expressions have long been in use in English, German, and other languages.) "Game" constitutes a fairly extreme illustration because of the great diversity of games. In the particular examples that I have supplied, soli taire and baseball, there are no obvious similarities. Those examples, however, are linked together by networks of other games that resem ble one or both. Thus bridge resembles solitaire in being a card game, and partnerships in bridge resemble to some extent the division into teams that we find in baseball. Wittgenstein maintains that it is not necessary for all the instantiations of a category to share features in common in order for them to be labeled by the same category term. He allows, however, that some times the instantiations of a category do share elements in common, albeit that sharing may not be of primary importance for understand ing meaning. Something of a parallel claim has been entered in an approach to summarizing the distribution of recognized features in a classification. I refer to "numerical phenetics" in biological systematics and its empha sis on so-called "polythetic classification." The anthropologist Richard Chaney (1978: 139-140) points out that while Wittgenstein's employ ment of the expression "family resemblance" has to do with "how we use our words and concepts," "polythetic classification," in contrast, is "actuarial data summary." Both Wittgenstein and numerical pheneticists attempt, in their different ways and for different purposes, to comprehend phenomena in multi factorial fashion. Wittgenstein, as noted earlier, allows that in some cases all of the instantiations of a category may share one or more fea tures in common, but that even if they do, that fact by itself may not disclose what is most significant about the category. Numerical phe neticists, for their part, allow that the members of a biological taxon are likely to share one or more "character states" in common (Sokal and Sneath 1963: 14). But even though "natural taxa are usually not fully polythetic," for operational purposes pheneticists proceed as if they were (Sneath and Sokal 1973: 21-22). Polythetic taxa, indeed, may revolve around monothetic cores.</page><page sequence="24">228 BENSON SALER Without going any further into technicalities,8 suffice it to say that the two quite different intellectual engagements referred to above mutu ally support an important point. Briefly put, in anything as complex as biological systematics or the exploration of how we use terms and concepts in everyday life, we need to maximize the diversity of rele vant variables and values taken into account. This is so even if we can identify one or more common features. In applying that insight to our interest in concepts and categories, it can be argued that we ought to consider a wealth of possibilities. That would include possible theories or "idealized cognitive models" that may help explain the structures of categories, the relevance of contexts for affecting conceptual strategies and tactics, variable weightings of features, and constraints on what people may be prepared to recognize (Lakoff 1987, Medin 1989). Rather than pursue this line of thought abstractly, however, I turn now to a limited discussion of a particular case: that of "supernatural agents" as we find them not only in what we unhesitatingly regard as "religion" but elsewhere as well. Supernatural Agents Boyer makes the postulation of supernatural agents central to his con ceptualization of religion. Such agents conform for the most part to intuitive ontologies and expectations about persons as agents while departing from those ontologies and expectations in a relatively small number of arresting particulars (Boyer 1994, 2001). Supernatural agents, Boyer writes, are "defined as violations of intuitions about agents" (2004: 31).9 But as Boyer acknowledges on the same page, in addition to occurring in religion, "supernatural characters" are also "found in folk tales and other minor cultural domains." I would go further. In our society, certainly, references to supernatural agents are widely encoun tered, if only as rhetorical ploys. Many such references are not usually taken as assertions of the reality of such agents (except, perhaps, as tropes). There are, however, references that do appear to implicate ontological commitments. 8 More substantial descriptions and comparisons of polythesis and family resem blance can be found in Saler 2000 [1993]: Chapter 5. 5 Defining supernatural agents as counter-intuitive could go a long way toward resolving old arguments about the probity and utility of the term "supernatural." See Pyysiàinen 2001.</page><page sequence="25">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 229 Supernatural agents are encountered in what we are likely to regard as the most prototypical (the adjudged "clearest") cases of religion. And they can be absent in some instances of what certain authors call "sec ular religions" or "quasi-religions," assemblages of elements that resem ble more prototypical exemplars of religion, but not sufficiently enough to escape qualification. To complicate matters further, they are some times encountered in cases that many classify without explicit qualification as "religion" while deeming them somewhat ambiguous instances of that category. The canon of Canonical Theravada Buddhism, for example, recog nizes gods but does not assign them salvific functions (salvation is real ized only by following the teachings of the Buddha). Largely because it does not, both Durkheim (1965 [1912]) and Southwold (1978) deny that theism is crucial to the definition of religion (Southwold argues that gods are contingent elements in religion, not necessary ones). But, as Spiro (1982 [1970]) points out, many Theravada Buddhists, despite what is inscribed in the canon, seek to invoke, propitiate, or avoid a variety of beings that he terms "superhuman." Spiro (1966) also argues that the Buddha is himself a "superhuman" being and therefore godlike, an argument that Southwold (1978) rejects as vague and un persuasive. Putting aside arguments about the Buddha, suffice it to suggest that the resolution of arguments about the status of gods and other super natural agents in Theravada Buddhism ought to involve some func tional considerations. Because the canon stresses salvation and accords no crucial or central importance to gods or other supernatural agents for obtaining it, we can argue that it does not render them religious objects. Many Theravada Buddhists, however, in invoking or propiti ating godlike beings in the hope of relieving sickness or enhancing prospects for success in various undertakings do treat them in a way that can induce us to classify them as religious objects. Functional considerations also apply to other cases where (according to Boyer's characterization) we find supernatural agents but it would be stretching things to call them religious objects. Our allowance that this is so conduces, in my opinion, to at least three conclusions. First, references to supernatural agents do not by themselves estab lish the existence of religion. While such references are typical of reli gion, they are certainly not sufficient for applying the category label. People, in my opinion, must deem supernatural agents to offer prospects of making significant differences in their lives if we are to account those agents religious objects. While postulations of supernatural agents can</page><page sequence="26">230 BENSON SALER be numbered among religion-constituting elements, it is only when they are supported by other religion-constituting elements in appropriate contexts that we have religion. Second, if we deem admission to a group (as comprehended by the category religion) to be a matter of "more or less" rather than a mat ter of "yes or no," then an argument can be made for admitting "sec ular religions" and "quasi-religions" as peripheral members. Some of these peripheral cases, as indicated earlier, do not accord functional significance to supernatural agents or even call attention to them, unlike more central (more prototypical) exemplars of religion. If this be accepted, we could go on to argue that supernatural agents, though clearly typ ical of religion, are not necessaiy elements for recognizing religion. Third, the wide occurrence of supernatural agents outside of what we unhesitatingly call religion is a matter of considerable interest. Boyer explains cogently why supernatural agents occur. But, despite some inter esting things that he says (in Boyer 2001), he does not broadly assess the consequences of their occurrences in diverse areas of human life. The developing science of religion may profitably do so. Indeed, by tracing the significance of elements that we deem typical of religion as they occur outside of the clear purview of what we conventionally call reli gion, we transcend religion. To the extent, that is, that we study ele ments that we regard as especially typical of religion in less typical settings, we attend to a religious dimension in human life that reaches out beyond religion. 4. Toward a Scholarly Model of Religion A scholarly model of religion, as I conceive it, should consist of a pool of elements that scholars associate with religions. Not all will be found in all religions. Some will be more typical of what we mean by reli gion than others, both in terms of distributions and weightings. And many will be found outside of the purview of what scholars conven tionally designate as religions. None by themselves are necessary for identifying religion, and none by themselves are sufficient for doing so. The approach outlined above emphasizes central tendencies rather than essences, fuzzy peripheries rather than sharp boundaries, resem blances rather than identities, and typical features rather than distinc tive ones. Grounded in informed accommodations to the realities of language and categorization rather than in quixotic requirements for transparency and precision, and with relevance to the cognitive and</page><page sequence="27">TOWARDS A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT "SCIENCE OF RELIGION" 231 evolutionary sciences, it encourages us both to explore religion and to transcend it. While religion and a religious dimension in human life are neither sui generis nor autonomous, and so not immune to reduc tive explanation, they are facets of the human condition, and it makes analytical as well as existential sense to conceptualize them as such.
