<plain_text><page sequence="1">Masks of the Point Hope Eskimo By James W. VanStone One of the largest and oldest concentrations of population along the barren, windswept coast of northwest Alaska is the Eskimo village of Tigara, or Point Hope. This community, located well above the 68th parallel and nearly 150 miles north of Kotzebue Sound, has been occupied continuously for at least 2000 years by people whose economy depends primarily on the hunting of sea mammals. The time of arrival of the various sea mammals at Point Hope is largely dependent upon movements of the sea ice, and this is responsible for the characteristic cyclical nature of hunting activities. Small hair seals are hunted at all times when the ice pack lies against the point, but most of the other animals important to the economy are migratory as are a variety of birds. Bowhead whales, walrus, and beluga are taken only during the spring, while polar bears are hunted on the pack ice during the winter months. Caribou are hunted in the fall in high country a few miles northeast of Point Hope and in summer when they come down to the coast near the village. Like the residents of a number of other communities in northwest Alaska, the people of Point Hope have, for centuries, hunted the huge bowhead whales each spring as they move up the coast on their annual migration through Bering Strait into the Beaufort Sea. This is certainly the most spec- tacular, if not the most important, aspect of the Point Hope subsistence economy and requires specialized equipment and techniques. Whaling is a communal activity involving a number of crews, each one using a large skin covered boat, an umiak. Each whaling captain (umelik) is responsible for preparing his boat and equipment and securing the services of a crew. Historically the umelik has held an important position in Point Hope village life. He was normally the wealthiest man in the large extended family that, in the past, characterized village social structure, and his position and prestige were achieved through skill, energy and the inheritance of property. Very often he was a shaman (angatkok) as well. Angatkoks were men or women</page><page sequence="2">Masks of the Point Hope Eskimo 829 who had vision experiences and special powers which segregated them as persons possessing unusual control over nature and natural forces. There was always one in every whaling crew. Living in a rugged environment where the procurement of food through the seasonal cycle of subsistence activities was uppermost in the minds of all adults, it is not surprising that in aboriginal times the religious and ceremonial life of the Point Hope Eskimo largely centered around the important super- natural relationship between men and animals. Dances were a significant aspect of ceremonialism, the chief purpose of which was to bind the human world to the supernatural world by means of a set of formal procedures. The various dances associated with particular ceremonies were considered impor- tant means of honoring, entertaining, and flattering the spirits of game animals that were vital to Eskimo economy. Therefore, the greatest number of dances used by the Point Hope Eskimo were designed to ensure a continuous supply of food. The people realized that spiritual forces were at work manipulating the basic needs of subsistence as well as life itself and that these supernatural forces needed to be placated and made aware of the wants and needs of men. Carved wooden masks were always an important, though not absolutely indispensible, part of dances and ceremonies at Point Hope. "Their use appears to have been an extra component, not a basic one, to weave additional meaning into the spell calculated to sway even the most recalcitrant spirit" (Ray and Blaker: 47). The masked dances and festivals also served a social function in that they helped to foster social cohesiveness by enabling the entire community to take part in activities which, in addition to fulfilling serious ceremonial functions, also had considerable entertainment value. Because of the importance of masks in the ceremonies of the Point Hope Eskimo, many were made, and they frequently are found in collections of ethnographic material obtained in northwest Alaska around the turn of the century when the traditional way of life was still extant. One such collection was made in 1897 by Miner W. Bruce for the Field Museum of Natural History which acquired the material the following year. Bruce had come to Alaska as first superintendent of the reindeer station at Port Clarence on Seward Peninsula. His collection of ethnographic material from Point Hope, although interesting, is not particularly noteworthy except for the occurrence of twenty-four wooden masks and a single puppet doll figure. These, together with five additional masks of approximately the same age collected by John Borden for the Museum in 1927, form one of the largest collections of Point Hope masks in any museum and are the subject of this study. During the summer of 1967, I made a brief visit to Point Hope with photographs of the masks in the Museum's collection. I had lived in the village for more than a year about ten years previous to this visit and I hoped that some of the informants who had been helpful to me at that time would be willing to look at the photographs and possibly recall details about the meanings of the masks and the ceremonies in which they were used. More than fifty years have elapsed since the Point Hope ceremonial cycle was performed in its entirety and, unfortunately, even elderly villagers were unable to provide</page><page sequence="3">830 JAMES W. VanStone Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 much information. A certain amount was obtained, however, and it is included here along with data from published sources *. There are a number of other important collections of Point Hope masks. Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian minister and first General Agent of Educa- tion in Alaska, collected a large number in 1891. Some of these were excavated from old houses in the Tigara site at the end of the Point Hope spit, while others came from the cemetery behind the village (Ray and Blaker: 93). Jackson's collection is now in the museum bearing his name at Sitka, Alaska. In 1924 Knud Rasmussen visited Point Hope and collected many archae- ological and ethnographic specimens including three nineteenth century masks (Mathiassen). These are in the Danish National Museum in Copenhagen. Another large collection of nearly fifty wooden masks from Point Hope is also in the Danish National Museum. These were obtained under rather unusual circumstances by Helge Larsen and Froelich Rainey, archaeolo- gists working at Point Hope in 1939. During the summer of that year an elderly woman of the village, while digging in an abandoned qalegi, or ceremonial house, found a cache of wellpreserved masks which the archaeologists were able to purchase (Rainey 1959: 11; Ray and Blaker: 211). Several of these have been illustrated by various writers, as have been a number of other masks from Point Hope in museum collections, including examples obtained by Sheldon Jackson and Knud Rasmussen. These published photographs will be referred to for comparison with the masks which are the subject of this study. It is apparent that angatkoks were responsible for most of the concepts expressed in the masks from Point Hope which were meant to interpret their vision experiences. An angatkok operated through spirit beings called tungai (singular, tungak). The tungai could be the spirits or souls of dead men or animals. They could also be simply spirits of the air or ground who did not have any special connection with living things. A young person who showed indications of becoming an angatkok was invited by the spirits to visit the spirit world. His spirit would then leave his body and wander about in the spirit world. During this time the angatkok himself would go into a trance and remain that way until his spirit returned (Rainey 1947: 275). During each of his journeys to the land of the spirits, the angatkok would receive many fresh impressions of new spirit faces. On his return he would carve, or ask others to carve, wooden masks representing the tungai he had seen in the spirit world. The angatkoks often learned new songs during their trips. Afterwards, these were sung by the shamans during ceremonies in the qalegi at which time the performers wore the different masks that had been made, each mask having its own song. Often a great many masks were 1 I would like to thank David Frankson, Jimmy Killigvuk, and Christopher Tingook of Point Hope, and Charlie Jensen of Kotzebue for their assistance in col- lecting the field data on which this study is based. For critical comments and useful suggestions during the preparation of this paper I am grateful to my colleague, Phillip H. Lewis.</page><page sequence="4">Masks of the Point Hope Eskimo 831 needed and the angatkoks would call upon skilled carvers to interpret their vision experiences. It seems probable that the carvers, although generally following the shamans' instructions, would include some aspects of their own interpretations in the finished products. In this manner, a special kind of art can be said to have developed at Point Hope and in other northern villages ; an art which had for its purpose the reproduction of the experiences of angatkoks (Ray and Blaker: 50; -Rasmussen: 331 f .;- Ostermann : 60, 131 f.). Rainey (1959: 12) has given us a graphic description of the manner in which one of the last great angatkoks at Point Hope obtained the vision experience which led to his acceptance as a shaman. He and his friends carved a set of masks showing the features of his helping spirit (tungak), a man who had recently died and then appeared to the incipient angatkok as the captain of an umiak which floated through the air over the tundra. The spirit had a distorted face which the carvers reproduced in the masks, and a personal song which the new angatkok taught to his friends so that they could sing it with him when they danced his vision in the qalegi. It should be emphasized that the aim of the mask carver was not to make a realistic copy but to interpret an idea that had originated in a vision. The fact that the carver of a mask might be a different person than the one who had the vision adds, as we have noted, to the complexity of the conception (Ray and Blaker: 70). Perhaps the most surprising thing about Point Hope masks is that despite the tremendous variety of spirits and mythological beings in the Eskimo cosmology, most carvings are in recognizable human or animal form. This fact emphasizes the close relationship between man and animals that had its expression in the spirit as well as the real world. As might be expected, a good many ceremonies in which masks were used at Point Hope were connected in one way or another with whaling. In the fall, when new ice had begun to form along the shore, but before the pack ice had moved in from the north, a series of religious ceremonies were performed in the two qalegis in the village primarily by the umeliks and their wives. The significance of these ceremonies and the sequence of events cannot, at the present time, be clearly determined since, according to Rainey (1947: 247 f.), they have not been performed since about 1910. One important feature of the four days of ceremonies, however, was the hanging of sacred figures called qologogoloqs in the qalegis. This term was applied primarily to carved wooden figures, among which were masks, that were kept permanently in the qalegis. Each qologogoloq, whether or not it was a mask, represented a famous ancestor or some well known natural or supernatural event and had to be justified by a story. They were hung from the ceiling of the qalegi on thongs, and during the morning on which this hanging took place men who desired good luck in hunting took turns washing the figures in urine. Soon after these religious ceremonies ended, a masquerade dance, called wingeruk, was held by both qalegis simultaneously. During the dance men and women of one qalegi, disguised and usually masked, went from their own ceremonial house to the other. Each visitor crawled through the entrance</page><page sequence="5">832 JAMES W. VanStone Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 hole into the qalegi and then danced alone before his or her uma, a person with the same name as the dancer's wife or husband. Following this masquerade dance, the qalegis were closed for four days. On the evening of the fourth day they were opened again and a second masquerade dance took place. This time disguised dancers from the second qalegi appeared at the first and when the final one had departed, the qologogoloqs were taken down and stored away until the next year (Rainey 1947: 252). These masquerade dances are one of the few events in the aboriginal ceremonial cycle of the Point Hope Es- kimo that are still held at the present time (see VanStone 1962: 121). It seems likely that many of the masks in the Field Museum's collection were used in the ceremonies just described as well as in a variety of shamanistic performances. In addition, laymen as well as angatkoks were constantly " seeing " new masks and then carving them. This inevitably resulted in considerable technical and artistic variation. For purposes of description, the total collection is divided into four categories. The first category consists of masks with natural- istic human features, while the second includes specimens in which the human form is distorted to a greater or lesser degree. In the third category are animal masks or masks in which animal and human features are combined. A fourth category consists of a single object which is not actually a mask at all, but the head of a doll-like creature that was apparently used in a specific ceremony at Point Hope and other northern villages. All the masks as well as the doll figure are made of spruce driftwood. Ray and Blaker (p. 71) have noted that unpainted masks from any part of Alaska were generally made so that the grain of the wood followed the contour of features to be emphasized. For the most part, this is true of the Point Hope masks to be described here. The thirteen human-like masks in the first category form the largest group and probably represent the most common Point Hope masks encountered in any museum collection. It seems certain that these were associated with dances and entertainments of a more secular nature and informants stated that they were most likely to have been made by individuals other than shamans. Many were doubtless used in the winger uk ceremony and it is also possible that some were placed on graves in the Point Hope cemetery since this custom was widespread all along the coast north of St. Michael (Ray and Blaker: 22). There were apparently few restrictions on the type of portrayal that was acceptable and this is clear both from the variety of forms in the first category and in those portrait masks in collections from other museums. One Point Hope informant told a story about an angatkok who, after attending an "inviting in" feast in another village, carved masks to represent the many different people he saw there. Another informant noted that a man would sometimes carve a mask in his own image by looking at his reflection in a seal oil lamp as he worked. In any event, the masks to be described below illustrate graphically the visual imagination as well as the technical skill of the Point Hope carvers.</page><page sequence="6">James W.

Catalogue no. 53472, 19 cm high (PL 1 A) The surface of this mask is very smooth and does not exhibit the blackish color that is characteristic of so many Point Hope masks. The grain of the wood very cleverly emphasizes the cheek bones and chin. A narrow ridge extends from the bridge of the nose to the top of the head. Traces of a mustache and eyebrows, possibly painted with ashes or graphite mixed with oil, can be noted, and there are indications of a reddish coloring around the mouth. A down-turned mouth on a mask has generally been thought to repre- sent a female and an upturned mouth a male. Ray and Blaker (p. 68), however, do not consider this to be true. 2. Catalogue no. 53480, 19 cm high (PL 1 B) Another light colored mask with the grain of the wood emphasizing cheek bones and chin. The brow ridges are raised slightly and traces of a black mustache can be noted. A vertical red line extends from the center of the upper lip to the nostrils and there are traces of red around the mouth. 3. Catalogue no. 53471, 18 cm high This mask is very similar to the specimen just described except that the eyebrows are arched and the eyes slanted. Even these slight differences, however, give the portrayal a distinct individuality. It seems probable that masks of this general type were made quite frequently at Point Hope. Similar specimens are illustrated by Oswalt (opp. p. 167, no. 9, middle) from a collection in the University of Alaska Museum and Giddings (PL IX, p. 44, far left) in a plate of four masks, part of the collection of fifty or more purchased at Point Hope by Larsen and Rainey. Murdoch (Fig. 366, p. 366) collected a mask at Point Barrow with eyebrows and mustache marked out in black and with traces of red ochre on the lips. He specifically mentions that it resembles those from Point Hope. According to Ray and Blaker (p. 214), Sheldon Jackson collected many portrait masks with black mustaches and goatees from the Point Hope cemetery. All had vertical ridges down the forehead and well defined eyebrows painted black. 4. Catalogue no. 53477, approximately 19 cm high (PL 1 C) The original mask is lost. The following description is taken from a photograph. This is a very plain portrait mask of light wood which is noteworthy for the absence of emphasis on any aspect of the features. The grain of the wood appears to call attention to this featural uniformity. 5. Catalogue no. 53475, 18 cm high (PL 1 D) The fullness of features frequently associated with Eskimo physiognomy is clearly evident in this mask, the surface of which is extremely smooth. Hair has been indicated with black paint. 6. Catalogue no. 53476, 23 cm high (PL 2 A) This mask, like many in the collection, is dark colored. There are traces of red paint around the lips and in a straight line between the center of the upper lip and the nose. The mouth originally contained four teeth set along the upper lip. There are a series of small holes at approximately 2.5 cm intervals around the outer edge of this mask sug- gesting that the complete mask was, at one time, characterized by a series of appendages. Such appendages were usually attached to masks with seal skin strips, willow root, or baleen.</page><page sequence="15">834 JAMES W. VanStONE Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 7. Catalogue no. 53479, 16 cm high (PL 2 B) This round, cheerful looking mask shows particularly careful workmanship. The cheek bones and chin are emphasized and the symmetrical placement of the eyes, nose and mouth is also noteworthy. Hair and a mustache are indicated with black paint and there are black circles with dots in the center on either side of the lower lip ; these suggest labrets. A triangular shaped, black painted area, possibly a goatee, begins in the middle of the lower lip and broadens out to the rim of the mask. When Dorothy Jean Ray examined a photograph of this specimen, she believed it to resemble closely one she had seen in the museum at Sitka which was supposed to have been used in a ceremony to bring good weather. A mask in the Danish National Museum that is quite similar is illustrated by Meldgaard (no. 35). 8. Catalogue no. 53478, 22 cm high (PL 2 C) This very dark specimen is well carved and noteworthy for its prominent nose and sharply pointed chin. There is a hole below the lips on one side suggesting that a separate labret was at one time inserted. A narrow groove with holes at 4 cm intervals runs around the edge of this specimen suggesting some form of appendages, perhaps a fur ruff. Point Hope informants stated that ruffs of wolverine fur or caribou skin were frequently found on masks. 9. Catalogue no. 77788, 25 cm high (PL 2 D) This specimen is not a mask in the true sense at all, but simply a facial image, flat across the back with features carved on the front and a short handle. It is possible that such an image was held in front of the face during dances like those associated with wingeruk. 10. Catalogue no. 53463, 22 cm high (PL 3 A) A well carved mask with black hair, a vertical red line running from the center of the upper lip to the nose, and a triangular red goatee on the chin. The mouth is inset with caribou incisors and there are engraved lines branching into three prongs at the ends which run out from either side. This is the only example of engraving on any of the masks in the collection. It is possible that these lines are intended to suggest tattooing, although I am not familiar with this form of tattoo in northwest Alaska. 11. Catalogue no. 53481, 20.5 cm high (PL 3 B) A crudely made mask of light wood with small eyes and a broad, flat nose. The specimen has black hair, a red vertical line from the upper lip to the nose, and a poorly defined area of reddish color on the chin. The mouth is inset with caribou and seal incisors. 12. Catalogue no. 53474, 28 cm high (PL 3 C) This long narrow specimen, the largest of those in the first category, is encrusted with some dried material, possibly oil. The features of this mask are much more angular and stylized than any of the others in this category and it might very well have been placed in the following group. The massive brows, narrow eyes and wide, flat nose give the features a horizontal emphasis that makes the specimen seem less long and thin than it actually is.</page><page sequence="16">Masks of the Point Hope Eskimo 835 13. Catalogue no. 177789, 17 cm high (PL 3 D) The large mouth and long, narrow eyes give this mask a blank, squinting appear- ance. Hair, eyebrows and mustache are indicated in black and there is a vertical black line on the chin. A series of small holes at 3.5 cm intervals run around the edge of the specimen but do not extend through to the back. Perhaps feathers or tufts of hair were inserted as appendages. Small holes on either side of the mouth suggest labrets. The masks in the second category are also naturalistic, but the human features are distorted to some extent. As might be expected, it has been difficult to draw a precise line between the first and second categories and it will be apparent that some masks already described might well have been included in the latter category. Nonetheless, it is clear that the masks about to be described are not portrait masks in any real sense. 14. Catalogue no. 53462, 18 cm high (PL 4 A) This dark specimen with its slanted slit eyes, flaring nostrils and tooth-filled mouth clearly shows the degree of exaggeration possible within a generally naturalistic frame- work. This mask has a series of small slits at irregular intervals around the edge indicating that inserted appendages of some sort formed part of the original conception. 15. Catalogue no. 177790, 26 cm high (PL 4 B) This is the only painted mask in the entire collection, being dark red with black eyebrows and mustache. Distinguishing features are the long, thin nose and narrow slits for eyes and mouth. A circular depression below the mouth once held a round, flat labret. Since this specimen lacks the holes on each side that would be present were it intended for wearing on the face, it may be simply a facial image for placing in the house tunnel for protection. According to Ray and Blaker (p. 212), as well as informants, such a practice was common at Point Hope. 16. Catalogue no. 53460, 23 cm high (PL 4 C) The angular characteristics of this very dark mask make it unique in the collection. The massive forehead overhang is particularly noteworthy as is the triangular nose and slit eyes and mouth. This angularity is not an unknown element in masks from Point Hope. It is present to a greater or lesser degree in specimens in the Washington State and Sitka museums illustrated by Ray and Blaker (PL 52; PL 54, upper right). 17. Catalogue no. 53459, 15 cm high (PL 4 D) This smooth, rounded mask has been skillfully carved so that the grain of the wood emphasizes the raised, rounded cheeks and the chin. The roundness of this specimen is emphasized by the long, narrow, slightly upturned mouth which is simply one element in a circular ring which surrounds the cheeks and eyes. Point Hope informants who exam- ined a photograph of this mask were unanimous in their belief that it was intended to represent the moon. Rainey (1967 : 270) has noted that among the many supernatural beings recognized in Point Hope stories and myths, probably the most important was Alignuit, the moon-man. He is supposed to have had considerable control over the lives of men and animals and even over the earth itself.</page><page sequence="17">836 JAMES W. VanStONE Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 18. Catalogue no. 177791, 21 cm high (PI. 5 A) A crudely carved but effective mask, the high cheek bones and hollow nose of which suggest that the carver may have intended it to represent a skull. A unique feature of this specimen is the vertical and horizontal grooves on the forehead. Horizontal grooves frequently occur on Point Hope masks and are, in fact, characteristic of the most frequent- ly illustrated of all masks from the village; a striking specimen in the Danish National Museum (Rainey 1959: 12, lower left; Meldgaard, no. 7; Ray and Blaker, PL 50). 19. Catalogue no. 53461, 21.5 cm high (PL 5 B) A dark black mask with narrow eyes, a broad, flaring nose and distended mouth through which is emerging a round form with two parallel slits in the center. It is a common element of Point Hope Eskimo belief that when an angatkok receives his power- spirit, it comes out through his mouth. Rainey (1947: 249) describes in some detail a ceremony in which a shaman receives such a spirit and during which whale flukes protrude from his mouth. Informants stated too that sometimes walrus tusks or polar bear teeth, instead of whale flukes, protruded and blood occasionally dripped from the angatkok's mouth. It is not clear just what animal, if indeed it is an animal, protrudes from this particular mask. One informant considered it to be a whale and that the head was pro- truding instead of the flukes, the two parallel slits being the breathing hole of the animal. Another insisted, however, that the mask was used in connection with a ceremony to attract seals and that it is the seal spirit that is seen protruding. 20. Catalogue no. 53473, 22 cm high (PL 5 C) This asymmetrical representation is the most distorted of all the human-like masks in the collection. The long twisted nose culminates in a protruding mouth that is nothing but a narrow, flat slit. One eye is round, but the other, pushed far to the side, is ovoid in shape. Twisted faces are characteristic of Eskimo masks from all parts of Alaska and seem to have been a favorite method of depicting a spirit from the other world. Oswalt (opp. p. 167, no. 9, lower) illustrates a mask from Point Hope with a twisted nose and mouth. It is in the University of Alaska Museum. The Field Museum specimen is the only mask in the collection that has been published previously. It appears in Vaillant (PL 93) where it is simply described as representing "an uncanny conception of the supernatural". 21. Catalogue no. 53466, 16 cm high (PL 5 D) This unusual specimen is one of only two masks in the collection that do not represent an entire human or animal face. In actuality, it is a large nose, above which are two small eyes. Below the nose along the lower edge are four small holes from which teeth once protruded. Masks covering only part of the face have frequently been reported from Point Hope and other coastal communities in northwestern Alaska. Two specimens from Point Barrow collected by Rasmussen are illustrated by Mathiassen (Fig. 13, p. 48) and another from Point Hope by Giddings (PL IX, p. 44, far right). At the time of my visit to the village in 1967, 1 examined two such masks excavated from the Tigara midden and now in the possession of Point Hopers. These partial masks all cover the upper face only, leaving the area below the mouth clear. According to Rainey (1947 : 275) there was a generally accepted theory at Point Hope that all animals could at times appear with a human face. Thus anthropomorphic masks similar to those in the first two categories are frequently said to represent "caribou people" or "whale people". Conversely, it was also considered possible for angatkoks and, to a certain extent, ordinary</page><page sequence="18">Masks of the Point Hope Eskimo 837 persons to assume the face of an animal which could be represented in masks. The angatkok would assume the face of his power-spirit, and the layman that of his angoak animal. An angoak was a simple charm worn on the body or clothing, or kept in a special place. In some supernatural manner, a person's angoak associated him with certain animals that would assist him in hunting and rescue him from danger. They became his guardians and helpers (Van- Stone 1967: 7). The masks in the third category belong to this type and it is not surprising to find that most of them were associated with whales and whaling ceremonies, since the taking of these great animals was, and still is, the most highly ritualized subsistence activity carried out by the villagers. 22. Catalogue no. 53458, 38 cm high (PL 6 A) A characteristic form of whaling mask represented by this specimen and the follow- ing one depicts the animal's mouth and breathing hole in the area where a human mouth would be, while the tail is doubled over to form the nose. The eyes are the only human feature of this mask which is smoothly carved and very dark. 23. Catalogue no. 53457, 32.5 cm high (PI. 6 B) This specimen is similar to the one just described except that it is somewhat smaller and engraved lines representing the mouth are not present. The carving of the tail-nose is also flatter and less naturalistic. In 1891 Sheldon Jackson collected several masks at Point Hope with whales or whale tails that served as noses and eyebrows. Three of these are illustrated by Ray and Blaker (PL 52; PI. 54, top and bottom left). A more human- like mask with a whale tail nose is illustrated by Giddings (PI. IX, p. 44, second from left). 24. Catalogue no. 53470, 31.5 cm high (PL 6 C) A somewhat different representation of a whale is shown in this mask. Only the animal's head is depicted with the line representing the mouth extending downward from just below the round eyes and the nose represented by the breathing hole. This specimen, which is very dark in color, has two slits 5 cm long and 6 cm apart along the upper edge as if for two ear-like appendages. 25. Catalogue no. 53464, 29 cm high (PI. 6 D) This and the following mask are more human-like but, nevertheless, utilize part of a whale's shape. The eyebrows and slit eyes are of human form, but the lower part of the specimen is a skillfully carved whale's head with the mouth and breathing hole clearly indicated. Like the mask previously described (no. 24), this one has narrow slits 2.5 cm long and 6 cm apart along the upper edge. 26. Catalogue no. 53465, 29 cm high (PI. 7 A) Almost identical to number 25, this mask has narrower, more curved eyes and is flat along the lower edge. But it also has a whale's head which characterizes the lower face. It seems certain that whale masks like these that have just been described were used in connection with the elaborate ceremonies which were an integral part of the Point Hope whale cult. Informants indicated that such masks were definitely associated with cere- monies held before whaling in March and April designed to bring whales to the vicinity of the village so that they could be killed. The wearing of the mask was thought to charm the whale, the person wearing it taking on the characteristics of the animal and allowing</page><page sequence="19">838 JAMES W. VanStone Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 itself to be persuaded to come by the village and be killed. Such masks were likely to be carved by the umelik himself or his angatkok. Sometimes, of course, the captain was also an angatkok. 27. Catalogue no. 177792, 24.5 cm high (PL 7 B) Whales are not the only animals depicted on the Point Hope masks in the Museum's collection. This specimen of light colored wood is in the form of a walrus head. The eyes and nostrils of the creature are indicated and the mouth is in the form of a deep, narrow, semi-circular slit. On either side of the mouth and not visible in the photograph are two round holes 3 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm deep where ivory or wooden tusks were inserted. Were it not for these tusk holes, the animal might have been identified as a seal. There is a small hole between the eyes the purpose of which is unknown. 28. Catalogue no. 53468, 20 cm high (PL 7 C) Another walrus mask, this one more stylized than no. 27. This specimen is charac- terized by high cheek bones and simple round holes for eyes and nose. On either side of the down-curved mouth and not showing in the photograph, are round holes 3.5 cm in diameter and 4 cm deep for tusk appendages. According to informants, masks in the shape of walrus heads were most frequently worn by angatkoks and used in ceremonies to bring the walrus spirit. Rasmussen (Ostermann: 123) called such masks kaupaq and stated that they were used outside the qalegi during songs and exhortations for the purpose of procuring walrus. 29. Catalogue no. 53456, 14 cm high (PL 7 D) This mask has large ears, round eyes and a round nose; it appears to have covered only the upper part of the face. Traces of red paint are noticeable on the forehead. In- formants identified this mask as representing a mouse. Rasmussen (Ostermann: 154-157) records a story about a giant mouse in the Colville area but Point Hope informants were unfamiliar with the story. The only other animal masks from Point Hope described and illustrated in the literature are a "wolf mask" and a "fox mask", both collected by Rasmussen. They are said to represent the "experiences of a shaman" (Ma- thiassen: 68; Fig. 29, p. 67; PI. 12, 13). 30. Catalogue no. 53492, 42 cm high (PI. 8 A and B) The fourth category of carved figures from Point Hope consists of a single object that is not actually a mask at all, but rather a large head with a wedge shaped projection extending below it. The naturalistic human face of this object has ivory eyes with inset blue beads and a straight, rectangular mouth which probably also was once inset with ivory. A deep groove extends entirely around the edge of the face, and the back of the head is hollowed out in the center (PL 8 B). According to informants, this figure is the head of a large doll which was used in certain ceremonies in which the figure would be dressed in a parka which was drawn tight in the groove around the face. The head could be manipulated like a puppet when a hand was inserted in the holes toward the back. Rainey (1947: 250 f.) describes one of the fall whaling ceremonies called suglut in which various puppets were activated on suspended lines. However, these puppets, including an entire whaling crew in a small umiak, are described as being much smaller than tht? doll figure in the Museum's collection. In his account of a suvdlut feast and ceremony</page><page sequence="20">Masks of the Point Hope Eskimo 839 which was celebrated in the fall "in honor of the souls of the killed whales", Rasmussen (Ostermann: 61) describes a "doll with no underbody" which was placed in the center of the qalegi floor. Unfortunately, there is no other reference to this doll, its size, or the part it played in the ceremony. It seems certain, however, that such puppet figures, doubtless varying greatly in size and complexity, were an integral part of the fall ceremonies which involved the two qalegis and had as their primary purpose the propitiation of the whale spirit. The term suglut, or suvdlut, was derived from a certain type of skin mask made by men in the two qalegis. Raine y (1947 : 249) describes these as being actually half masks made from tanned white caribou skins. It thus appears that the typical wooden masks like those described here were not used in this particular ceremony involving wooden puppets and dolls. Although it cannot be determined with certainty when the last wooden masks were made at Point Hope, informants believe that there were few in use after about 1910. It is clear that virtually all of those in museum collections were made in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Even those excavated from the Tigara midden presumably date no earlier than the middle of the last century. So it may be that the entire mask complex, at least in the elaborate form indicated by the specimens described in this study, is a phenomenon of this relatively late period. Beginning in the 1930's, masks of whale bone were carved by the villagers for the first time. Today these are sold to the village store for eventual distribution to craft shops in Seattle and other cities across the country. Some informants say that these non-functional whale bone masks were not carved until after the villagers observed archaeol- ogists and others excavating the traditional wooden variety from the Tigara midden. In spite of the fact that masks continued to be made and used at Point Hope until relatively recently, it has not been possible in this study to make more than the most general statements concerning the specific ceremonies of which they were an integral part. But they do indicate beyond a doubt that the relations of the Point Hope Eskimo with nature and the supernatural were highly individualistic. The whole guardian or helping spirit system is based upon an individual's own charms and supernatural powers. Although angatkoks obviously had relations with the most powerful spirits, everyone had at least some spiritual association with powers that were capable of controling the course of events. The great variety exhibited in the masks described here is simply one element in that intensely individual relationship. Bibliography GlDDINGS, J. L. 1941 Dendrochronology in Northern Alaska.
