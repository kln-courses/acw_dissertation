<plain_text><page sequence="1">MESSIANISM: ITS HISTORICAL ORIGIN AND MORPHOLOGY The Western tradition, of Jewish and Christian origin, has so deeply and univocally influenced our ideas on religious phenomena that it might seem improper to speak of messianism in a sense which inten- tionally transcends the Judeo-Christian religious tradition. Recently an ethnologist, experienced in the prophetism of primitive peoples, pointed out to us that the term "messianism" cannot correctly be applied to religious phenomena that are not in some way linked to the original cultural milieu in which the very term is etymologically rooted ("Messiah" from the Jewish mdshiah="the anointed" [of God], i.e., the "chosen"). The same scholar said that there is no true messianism without a personal savior.' In this regard, we must note in the first place that in its origin the Jewish term had such a generic and, so to speak, extra-messianic meaning (from a Christian point of view) that it was used to designate at the same time a high priest or a Jewish monarch, inasmuch as they were endowed with a high dignity, and even a pagan foreigner like the Persian Cyrus who gave back freedom to the captive Jews in Babylon.

The date of publication is fictitious; the book actually came out in 1960. 52 Vittorio Lanternari</page><page sequence="2">It is true that the term could also be applied to that person an- nounced and expected from among the Israelites, and who, according to many prophetic texts, was to bring the Golden Era, one of freedom, peace, harmony, and justice. But only as a result of the later religious tradition, that is, only in the Christian Hellenic tradition (John 1:41; 4:25), and never before the Book of Enoch, the word "messiah" was circumscribed and identified with the historic person of the expected "savior" ("anointed," christos), interpreted as the renewer of the world. The same word designated also previously (Pss. 89:39, 52; 84:10) the whole people, Israel, or the Patriarchs (Pss. 105:15; I Chron. 16:22). The term "messiah," therefore, has a history, having changed its meaning in the course of time from a generic to a restricted and in- dividual one.2 The identification Messiah-Jesus is sanctioned in the Western world by a tradition of two thousand years, but in the light of the history of the word and from the viewpoint of a comparative history of religions, it seems scientifically correct to broaden the mean- ing of this word "messianism" so that we may include in it a series of manifestations which are homogeneous in their function. Needless to say, there remains an obligation to note not only the similarities but also the concrete differences among the different types of "messianic" manifestations. Besides, the same messianic complex which originated in Judaism and was confirmed in Christianity, with the figure of a future savior, was neither born from nothing nor was the fruit of a sudden and miraculous intuition of this or that prophet; on the con- trary, it shows profound and distant roots that reach down deep to the Mosaic level and presumably further back since Mosaism itself is a new synthesis of more ancient elements.3 Be that as it may, the message of the Jewish prophets is related to a theme of messianic ex- pectation already contained in the archaic Mosaic message (Deut. 18:15-22). They elaborate this message again in forms which are appropriate to the new exigencies of liberation whether they call the Messiah "Servant of God" (Isa. 35, 42), "Lord of Justice" (Jer. 13:5-8), "Son of Man" (Ezek. 10:33, 42; 33), "Chief of Armies" (Dan. 9:23-27), etc. Therefore, as a working hypothesis it seems to us that we should use the term "messiah" to designate any being, singular or plural, more or less anthropomorphic, expected by a community as the future savior in a religious context. 2 J. Klausner, The Messianic Idea in Israel (London, 1956), pp. 7-12. 3 Concerning Mosaism as a synthesis of archaic components of pastoral and agricultural origin, see V. Lanternari, La grandefesta (Milan, 1959), pp. 448-51. 53</page><page sequence="3">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology Now it seems legitimate to us, in the general picture of the history of religions, to raise the problem whether the messianic attitude is connatural, peculiar, and exclusive to the Jewish-Christian-Islamic stream (in the order: Moses and the prophets, Apocalypse, Mahdism), or rather whether this attitude has counterparts in heterogeneous religions of primitive background, independently of Western influence. Another great messianic stream is already present in some historic religions, among the most advanced, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. In Zoroastrianism the coming of Saosyant, the future savior, is awaited for the decisive struggle against the god of evil, Angramaniu, and the final triumph of good. From this idea, interwoven with the Indo-Iranian theories of the progressive decadence of the cosmic ages until the beginning of a new cycle of time, there evolved within popu- lar Buddhism the idea of the future Buddha, Maitreya, who is to de- scend one day upon earth after evil will have filled the world, to re- establish the kingdom of good.4 As one can see, the expectation of a supernatural being who will come or return at the end of a whole cycle of human existence to open a new era of freedom is shared by other religions outside the Jewish- Christian-Islamic tradition. In any case, it is interesting to note at this point that the messianic expectation is present within religious movements of salvation like Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Mosaism, Jewish prophetism of the Exile, and Christianity, and that these move- ments, like other ones, arose from time to time as an answer to a real need for renewal and catharsis, resulting from a state of oppression, anxiety, tension, and conflict at a collective and social level.5 But in order to come nearer to the basic problem, it will be better to ask once again: outside the "great historic religions" what are the concrete forms in which a correspondent or at least an embryonic messianic attitude is manifested? And so: on what cultural and social ground does messianism thrive to such an extent as to constitute true and proper "movements" of expectation of salvation? 4 E. Abegg, Der Messiasglauben in Indien und Iran (Berlin-Leipzig, 1928). 6 For the birth of Zoroastrianism in relation to the conflict between two hetero- geneous and contrasting cultural trends, see Lanternari, op. cit., p. 448. Concerning the rising of Buddhism and of Christianity in relation to the conflict between priesthood and state on the one hand and popular religious needs on the other, see my remarks in Nuovi Argomenti, XLII-XLIII (1960), 100-101. The Jewish prophetism of the time before the Exile (Amos, Isaiah, etc.) should be seen in rela- tion to the disasters afflicting the Jewish people at that time (political and religious schism, fall of the kingdom of Samaria) and to those easily foreseeable because of hostilities on the part of the neighboring peoples, and of Babylonian supremacy. Finally, the prophets of the Exile act in a time of catastrophe and collective despera- tion. In any case, the prophets interpret a need for liberation from present or im- minent evils which can be historically identified and determined. 54</page><page sequence="4">In this regard it will be useful to refer to one of the newest and most meaningful chapters of the modern history of religions: that which deals with the prophetic movements of freedom and salvation called nativistic or revivalistic, millenaristic, or movements of messianic expectation, etc. Morphological and comparative synthesis has hardly begun in the abundant literature concerning the prophetic movements at the ethnological level, not to mention the prophetic movements of the modern and cultured milieu. In 1960 the first comprehensive work of typological orientation which collects and orders the ethnological material on a universal scale was published.6 After a few months another work of universal syn- thesis, more historically than typologically oriented, appeared: it is the present writer's Movimenti religiosi di libertd e di salvezza dei popoli oppressi.7 In the frame of the problems which concern the prophetic move- ments and make such a study live and timely, the historian of religions will find particular interest in identifying the "structure" of the same movements, that is, the complex of the mythical and ritual themes that characterize them. But to understand the nature and function of such movements, the historian of religions must break down the structure into the various and heterogeneous historico-religious com- ponents, identifying the elements of the archaic tradition preserved in them and those derived from the higher religions, for example, Christianity, and finally point out the meaning and the function of the new religious synthesis in each movement. Concerning this last task, it is important to establish the exact relationship between pre-Chris- tian mythology and messianism as a historical phenomenon. In gen- eral, the prophets announce the advent or the coming back of mythical beings who appear as the desired demiurge to renew the world. The messianic advent or return of such beings presents itself as a develop- ment and re-elaboration of traditional mythical themes. We shall therefore try to outline the main messianic themes in some of the modern prophetic movements. One of the most recurring themes is that of the culture-hero who has disappeared and whose return is explicitly announced by some original myths. This theme is the foundation for numerous prophetic movements in various and different cultures: the Koreri movement (Schouten Island, Dutch Guinea), the Waropen movement8 (Dutch 6 Guariglia, op. cit. 7 Milan, 1960. The material in this paper has been taken from this work except where it is otherwise indicated. The Anglo-American issue of the book is now in preparation. 8 G. J. Held, The Papuas of Waropen (The Hague, 1957), pp. 320-21. 55</page><page sequence="5">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology Guinea), in Brazil the movements of the "divine men" gods, of pages and beatos, some forms of the Ghost Dance (Prairie Indians) and several religious manifestations in Africa. In all these instances, there- fore, we find the expectation of a founder-hero, protagonist of archaic myths, who at the beginning of time founded the elements of culture and then left with the promise of returning and bringing good fortune. In substance, the announced renewal of the world is understood as a new beginning of it, and this renewal finally constitutes one and the same religious experience with that of the mythical origins. The time of the eschaton and of the renewal are identified with that of the origins. In general, such identification characterizes all syncre- tistic movements of salvation. Of that we have many concordant mani- festations. Sometimes members of the white race are identified with the cul- ture-heroes of the ancient mythology. When, for instance, Bishop Patteson landed in the Banks Island for his evangelical mission, he and his companions were identified with Qat, the traditional trickster- hero and his brothers: the myth had announced their future return.9 Europeans are often identified with the dead who will come back. This is the main theme of very numerous Melanesian cargo-cults: the sea journey of the dead, an element peculiar to the traditional escha- tology, is united in a single experience with the journey of the white men who came by sea from the West. And the dead are in their way the restorers and demiurges of the cosmic palingenesis. In a different instance among the Indians of the prairies the new prophet who had announced the renewal of the world was himself identified with the traditional trickster-hero. Such is the case of Tenskwatawa, one of the promoters of the Ghost Dance; he was identified with Nababhozo, the culture-hero of the Algonquins.10 Sometimes Jesus himself is identified with the mythical founder of the origins: the Basutos of South Africa identify him with Senkatane, the culture-hero who, according to the local myth, saved mankind from a devouring monster at the beginning of time. Senkatane died, but his heart ascended to heaven. And now Jesus is Senkatane.ll The culture-hero is the characteristic mythical figure in the migratory movements of Brazil during the sixteenth century. The prophets of the Tupi-Guaranis, who founded xenophobian movements against 9 R. H. Codrington, The Melanesians (New Haven, Conn., 1957 ed.), pp. 166- 67.

Williams, Africa's God (Chestnut Hill, Pa., 1938), IX, South Africa, p. 307. 56</page><page sequence="6">the whites, induced the masses to migrate toward a "land without evils" in the footsteps of the culture-hero of the ancient tradition. Often, however, the culture-hero appears to the prophet in a vision and thus leaves his marks in the very beginning of the prophetic move- ment. An example of this is the movement started by the prophet Norane (Tukuna): the founder received the first impulse to his pro- phetic vision through the vision of the culture-hero, Dyei, who pre- scribed to him the norms of the new cult. Another example is Peyotism, with the visionary experience of John Rave, as described by Radin. Rave was identified in a dream with Hare, the culture-hero, and in his vision was killed by the serpent as in the myth Hare was swallowed by the serpent. Now the serpent devoured John Rave.12 Thus in the syncretistic movements the culture-hero is renewed in each case in different manners: the culture-hero returning among men as the renewer of the world (Messiah, Savior); or men following in the footsteps of the culture-hero and migrating toward his mythical coun- try; finally, the culture-hero lives again in the inspired vision of the prophet. Someone has said that the mythology of the culture-hero is not only important but plainly irreplaceable and a sine qua non to the very origin of any prophetic movement. According to Bastide, the absence of prophetism among the Brazilian Negroes should be ex- plained precisely by the absence of an adequate mythology of culture- heroes.l3 In reality, any prophetic movement, though related to the traditional myths, elaborates them again in the most various and unpredictable ways, renews them, transforms their content and func- tion-in view of new religious demands-and this independent of any rigid pattern. There is a great variety of cases, combinations, and syncretisms in the modern elaborations of the mythical culture-hero: the latter can be identified with the white man, or with the native prophet, or with Jesus. Sometimes he comes back among men and sometimes men go to him. He can be a mere founder or a trickster- hero, like Qat, Nababhozo, etc. His return is not always announced in the original myth; sometimes only his disappearance or death is mentioned. One example among others of a culture-hero who has disappeared and whose return is traditionally expected is that of Thoho-ya-Ndou, the hero of the Bavendas. According to the myth, 12 On the myth of Hare, the first man, culture-hero and founder of the cosmic order, see P. Radin, The Road of Life and Death (New York, 1953), pp. 301-9, 323-24, passim.

But he did not die, and the natives were certain that one day he would come back among his people and bring back to them their ancient greatness.l4 Apparently, this hero was not transferred in any of the modern messianic myths in spite of the millenarism contained in the original myth. As one can see, there is boundless freedom in the creative possibilities of religious history. Another messianic myth is related by Fr. Loupias from Ruanda. Ac- cording to this myth, Mutabazi, the culture-hero of the Watutzis, descended on earth in answer to men's prayers as an ambassador of the supreme being, Imana, and he brought all sorts of goods to man- kind. But later on men rebelled against him and nailed him to a tree and thus he died. So far the myth shows noticeable Christian influence. The myth goes on to say that whenever disaster overtakes the country the spirit of Mutabazi comes and dwells in the body of one of the king's sons, who is thus transformed into Mutabazi, and in this way the country is freed from calamity.15 This last element of the myth shows a local and pre-Christian source. Nababhozo (Manabhozo) is another culture-hero whose return was announced in the original myth. According to the myth, after he had accomplished his countless feats to save mankind from the monsters and had completed his work of demiurge and gone through innumer- able adventures, he retired to a little island of ice in the northern sea. There he was to remain and never again set foot on the earth. If he were ever to come back among men, a sudden conflagration would consume and destroy the whole world.16 We have just said that Nababhozo was identified with the prophet Tenkswatawa: the pagan original apocalyptic myth developed and ripened into a modern myth of renewal. But the mythical or historical heroes who in the Javanese prophetic movements came back to life from an ultra-mundane kingdom were not originally destined to be born again. Therefore, every time a mod- ern mythical elaboration announces the return of heroes, who in the original myth simply disappeared or died, a new and spontaneous de- velopment takes place in an embryonic theme contained in the tradi- tion. Modern messianism may no doubt develop more ancient seeds of a religion of expectation and salvation, but in itself it is a new and unmistakable phenomenon. Modern messianism, with its expectation 14 H. A. Stayt, The Bavenda (London, 1931), p. 13. 16 P. Loupias, Anthropos, III, 9-12, quoted in E. Anderson, Messianic Popular Movements in the Lower Congo (Uppsala, 1958), p. 262. 16 Handbook of American Indians, p. 21. 58</page><page sequence="8">of a global renewal, una tantum, answers to a unique situation of dan- ger: the clash with the white man and its drastic consequences. The identifications brought about by modern messianism are of various kinds: the syncretisms, too, are various, heterogeneous, spon- taneous. Moreover, besides the culture-hero, many other mythical beings stand out in the new prophetic developments. The protagonists of the return to the origins and the demiurges of the messianic re- newal can be of very different kinds. In the mythologies at an ethnological level we frequently find supreme beings. The supreme being is one among the most frequent mythical elements to be found in the new prophetic conceptions. Countlessly reinterpreted, the supreme being is at the center of the new syncretistic mythologies. On the other hand, some archaic mythol- ogies of the supreme being contain germs of a messianic expectation. Let us describe some concrete examples of this. Among the Lambas (Northern Rhodesia) the supreme being, Lesa Luchyele (sometimes Chuveane), disappeared, according to the myth, after he had created the world and had promised men that he would return. In another version it is said that Lesa Luchyele retired but his son, Kusane, was to come back and bring happiness and prosperity to mankind.17 It is said that Kusane will put an end to war: axes and maces will be trans- formed into ploughs.18 Another instance is that of the Nyais of north- ern Transvaal. When Fr. Asser, a missionary, preached to them the passion and death of Christ, some of the natives noticed a surprising similarity between the story of Jesus and an ancient tradition of their country. According to this tradition, the son of one of the great local chieftains had been killed by his subjects and the natives had set aside one day each week to commemorate this event. They really thought that the dead prince, whose name was yet unknown, would one day return among men and they were awaiting his coming.19 In western Africa a myth is known of a "son of God," Ilongo ja Anyambe, who was to descend one day upon the earth to free men from suffering and bring them happiness. According to the source from which we have this information, this myth had been abandoned a short time before the inquiry, a fact that seems to indicate that the myth is an original one.20 In a completely different cultural milieu, in Oceania, seeds of mes- 17 C.

Nassau, Fetishism in West Africa (London, 1904), p. 41. 59</page><page sequence="9">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology sianism are not lacking in the original pagan mythologies. In the Fiji Islands the divine twins, children of the supreme being, Degei, had disappeared from the country. Later, following the arrival of the white man, they (the twins) were expected to come back to their native land and with them all the dead, who would bring an age of bliss.21 In the Hawaiian mythology it is narrated that Lono, the god of agriculture, after he had instituted the Matahiki (New Year feast) had left by sea in a canoe and disappeared, promising, however, that he would come back, bringing goods and riches to the natives. Every year during the Matahiki festival the rite of "Lono's canoe" commem- orates the departure of the god whose return is expected.22 As one can see, the traditional mythology of primitive peoples con- tains, even before any contact with the white man, the theme of the return of supreme beings, gods, culture-heroes, and other mythical beings who had previously disappeared. In the cultural clash following the arrival of the white man this theme was easily remolded in its various formulations as an expression of new experiences and messian- ic demands caused by that very clash. The following example of this process of religious remolding seems to be especially meaningful, even though it is not really a prophetic movement. In the mythology of the Babembas (of Northern Rhodesia) there is a supreme being, Lesa Mukulu (Lesa the Great), creator of the world, of mankind, and of death. Next to him there is a culture-heroine who had saved mankind from the devouring monster, killing it and giving life back to those who had been swallowed by it. The Babembas identify their king, whom they worship, with the supreme being, Lesa Mukulu, and the queen with the heroine-demiurge of the myth. Evidently the heroine is a feminine hypostasis of the supreme being, herself creator and re- storer of the world and order. But the interesting fact is that the Europeans also, after their arrival, were identified by the natives with Lesa Mukulu, the supreme being or culture-hero.23 Thus as originally the king and queen, supporters of the social order, were identified with the protagonists of the creation myth, now the white man also, protagonist of the greatest cultural revolution in the land, was reinterpreted in the traditional way as exponent of the mythical creation or restoration of the world. This fact is verified even when the original myth had no mention of a future return of the supreme being or of the culture-hero. For 21 B. H. Thomson, The Fijians (London, 1908), pp. 141-42. 22 A.

He will use the magico-creative power attributed to him in the original myth. But the supreme being returns also in other ways to renew the traditional religion. Like the spirits of the dead and the culture-hero, he, too, appears to the prophet in a vision to instruct him regarding the founding of the new movement. This is the case of the Great Spirit from whom Wowoka and his fol- lowers (Smohalla, Kanatuk, etc.) received instruction regarding the great movement of the Ghost Dance. It is also the case of John Wilson and Handsome Lake to whom the Great Spirit gave inspiration to found, respectively, the Peyotism and the "New Religion" of the Iroquois, not to mention many other instances in which the supreme being is the element of conjunction between the old and the new, and the vehicle of renewal in the tradition. The supreme being is often identified with the Judeo-Christian God, and this is another form of syncretism in which a traditional mythical theme is reinterpreted in a messianic sense. So far we have seen that the disappeared culture-hero and the supreme being who comes back among men are germinal themes for modern messianism among primitive peoples. But among the prophet- ic movements the spirits of the dead also have the function of re- generating the world and of being, in their way, messiahs and saviors, even though in comparison with the examples already mentioned, they do so in a less personal manner. They act, in fact, collectively and anonymously. In the prophetic movements the expectation of the revelation of the dead is experienced as the expectation of cosmic palingenesis. The collective return of the dead, which is a traditional element of native religions, assumes a role equivalent to that of the individual messiah and is one of the most significant and frequent forms of the new messianic syncretism. Important, among others, is the case of the Plains Indians, followers of the Ghost Dance, and of 24 J. Mooney, Ann. Rep. Bur. Amer. Ethn., 1896, pp. 701-4. 61</page><page sequence="11">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology the Pomos, Wintuns, and Achomawis of California, followers of the Earth Lodge cult. About 1870 masses of proselytes started a migra- tory march in the direction assigned by the myth and which varied in each case according to the local myths. From that direction, as the prophetic announcement indicated, the dead were expected to re- turn.25 A similar instance is that of the Tupi-Guaranis who migrated toward the country of the culture-hero. In the Melanesian cargo- cults, often the native would decorate the shores with banners and prepare paths for the spirits, expecting that the dead would arrive by ship and leave on the shore of the island innumerable riches. Some- times they even built special airports to receive the dead who were to descend from airplanes, object of a messianic expectation.26 The whole complex of the cargo-cults is precisely built on the expectation of an imminent revolution against the present conditions of life, of a re- birth of the world brought about by the dead bringing merchandise and wealth. The expectation of the dead as renewers of the world is also one of the most common traits of the prophetic cults in Africa and America, from Kimbangism (Congo) to the Ghost Dance, etc. The dead, besides being the authors of the cosmic catastrophe, have an active part in the process of palingenesis. In fact, they will bring merchandise and wealth, bring back the bisons which have been de- stroyed (Ghost Dance), realize the age of freedom and salvation, and put an end to the situation of danger which was the very historical cause of the messianic movements. Here it is interesting to note that the germ of the messianic developments assumed by the religion of the dead within the prophetic cult was already present in the pre-Christian tradition. In the traditional "primitive" religions the dead have gen- erally a double function: they bring both good and evil, and this in the measure that the prescribed funeral rites are more or less exactly performed. The expected return of the dead is a very essential trait of traditional religious ceremonies, especially at the New Year festival (among the agriculturalists) and in the rites of initiation.27 Traditional mythology itself shows the dead as founders of civilization and festi- vals.28 The expected return of the dead is therefore an element of messianic religion, like the return of the culture-hero and of the su- preme being. In brief: the possibility of messianic formulations cannot be limited to the presence of just one mythical theme such as that of the culture-hero. 26 C.

In synthesis, the phenomena of the return of the culture-hero, of the supreme being, and of the spirits of the dead are various manifestations of a true re- ligion of return. The religion of return manifests itself in very different forms which may in turn depend on the cultural context, on different religious traditions, and on different prophetic personalities. But the religion of return is the essential kernel of messianism as such. Through it the era of salvation appears mythically as the reinstatement of the age of the origins. We can therefore say that any prophetic movement has its messianic aspect, because in it a salvation is expected which will be brought by mythical beings or events, whatever they might be. We said "mythical beings or events." In fact, besides the examples we have mentioned above and in which we find one or more demiurges of the world's rebirth (culture-hero, supreme being, spirits of the dead), there are instances in which the religion of return assumes even more differ- ent and original forms: it appears as the expectation of a particular and concrete event, namely, the reinstatement of a certain ancient his- torical situation no longer existing or present. There is no expectation for the return of mythical beings, whatever they may be, but of an historic age far remote in time and in the collective experience, an age which has become a myth and has been projected into the future. It will be the heavenly age of liberation and salvation. Among the many manifestations of this kind is the recent move- ment of Ras Tafari among the Negroes of Jamaica. Its prophetic nucleus is based on the expectation of a massive "return" of the Negroes to Africa, to the faraway original land where centuries ago their ancestors had been captured by the white slave merchants. Ras Tafari, the Negus of Ethiopia, is mythologized as the hero liberator, the exemplary defender of Negro independence against the oppression of the whites. According to the followers of this movement, Ras Tafari will be the liberator and the founder of the era which is the ob- ject of the messianic expectation of the Negroes. As one can see, the messianic idea of a "return to Africa" is based on concrete historical experience though these latter have been tinged with mythical conceptions. In brief, the identification of Ethiopia with Africa, of Haile Selassie with the Negro Messiah, and of Africa itself with the heavenly kingdom of salvation-all these are mythical remoldings of definite events and historical experiences. This shows 63</page><page sequence="13">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology how myths are created ex novo, under the impulse of vital experiences which have become particularly urgent and dramatic. Other religious forms of the "return to Africa" are expressed in the Negro Afro- American cults of Central and South America (Voodoo in Haiti, Candomble of Bahia, Xango, etc.). In these cults we see a symbolic "return to Africa" through the renewal of the original mythical African rites. Thus find adequate expression the desires of the Negroes for religious and cultural autonomy.29 The return to a distant historical age now lost was announced and promoted in the movement of the prophet Santos Atahuallpa in Peru in the eighteenth century (Campa culture). Santos preached, as a remedy for all evils, the restoration of the empire of the Incas against the Spanish domination; he introduced himself as the last descendant of the Incas. On the other hand, in the neo-Brazilian prophetic move- ments studied by M. I. de Queiroz (movements of Contestado- Canudos, Joazeiro) the founders advocated the restoration of the mon- archy and the abolition of the Brazilian Republic. To make this uto- pian dream come true, the prophets did not hesitate to take to arms and actively rebel against the regime in power.30 Finally, the Burk- hanian prophetic movement, which arose among the Altaic peoples in 1904, advocated the reinstatement of the ancient and fallen empire of the Mongols as a way to salvation. The founder, Chot Chelpan, announced the imminent return of Oirot Khan, leader of the Altaic Turks, who was to restore the ancient Khanate of Oirot and to set the people free from tzarist domination.31 In the instance just mentioned a return is announced, on a mes- sianic and mythical ground, of statuses which the local history offers as a pattern of an "age of the origins" or, what is essentially the same, of a heavenly age. In this regard it should not be forgotten that the fundamental nucleus of the Mosaic prophetism is constituted by a program of "return" to the lost land of Zion, and that also the proph- ets of the captivity pursue a similar religious idea, that is, the return to a historical condition anterior to that of their time. We cannot therefore hold to the culture-hero as the irreplaceable nucleus of the prophetic movements without disregarding the infinite variability of the prophetic formations and of the "religion of return." This latter takes different forms according to themes which in turn originate from myths (culture-hero, supreme being, spirits of the dead) or from his- 29 V.

In all these instances we have many spontaneous religious remoldings, whether of myths or history, according to the various demands for renewal. In fact, the transition from history to myth is imperceptible and almost continuous in primitive cultures. Not only past history is sub- ject to the process of being mythologized; present history is also subject to the same process. Thus contemporary prophets and found- ers become protagonists of a millenarian expectation: they are ex- pected to return to earth, to bring the desired salvation, and to redeem men from evil. Such is the case of Andre Matsua, the Congolese revo- lutionary leader who after he died became precisely the mythical protagonist of a millenarian expectation. And this also is the case of Macandal, the national hero of the Haitian independence: according to the popular belief his spirit escaped from the flames of the stake at which he was burned alive. In the prophetic movements of Java there was the messianic expectation of the "Prince of Justice," Ratuadil. Until recent times (twentieth century) the expectation among the Indonesians of the return of Prince Diponegoro, the Javanese hero, was very popular.32 Alexander Bedward, the founder of Bedwardism in Jamaica, is yet another exponent of this "religion of return" based on the mythical expectation of real persons. In fact, he himself an- nounced his coming ascension into heaven and his subsequent return as the redeemer of the Negroes. In the modern popular religion of Brazil there is the instance of the prophets, Joao Maria and Padre Cicero, who founded the prophetic movements mentioned above and who are faithfully expected to return and restore the kingdom of peace and justice. Also the great current of Mahdist movements in Africa and in Asia express with recurring cycles the same expectation of a reinstatement of ancient conditions. Even the "Negro Christ," so widely worshipped in the prophetic religions of black Africa, repre- sents the messianic reincarnations, projected into the future, of var- ious prophets who really lived once and who are now expected to return as liberators. When Isaiah Shembe, the founder of Zionism in South Africa, died, the rumor was spread that he would rise again.33 The same rumor was circulated when Kanakuk, the prophet of the Kickapoos, died in an epidemic of smallpox; some of his followers remained with his body in confident expectation until they also died, stricken by the epidemic.34 32 Ibid. 33 B.

At the same time, some members of the Salva- tion Army arrived in the country and they were regarded as reincar- nations of the great Simon: the letter S which they wore on their uniforms was considered to be the initial letter of the name Simon.35 These are, as one can see, reinterpretations in a messianic sense of persons who really once belonged to history. What was history im- perceptibly becomes myth. But the contrary is also true, that is, that myth definitely tends to- ward history. We would be unable to understand the meaning and the function of the prophetic movements in general were we to under- estimate either the historical causes that gave birth to them or the most immediate and dramatic developments they underwent on the religious, social, and political ground. It is easy to misunderstand the historical value of these movements if one fails to consider that fol- lowing the prophetic movements, movements of liberation arise, often of a revolutionary nature, new separatist and dissident churches are born, new sanctuaries and religious centers are founded of a definitely autonomous character, new "holy cities" are born as a result of the prophetic preaching, modeled on the biblical pattern (e.g., the Zionis- tic movement in South Africa, that of the Mormons, and the neo- Brazilian movements). Such initiatives and institutions are certainly of a religious nature, but they are at the same time affirmations of a cultural autonomy. They are also expressions of a social and political revolution and represent an active need for autonomy and freedom from oppression. The "religion of return" is thus articulated between two poles dia- lectically opposed: myth and history. History is transformed into myth; and myth gives meaning to history. Retrospectively, the religion of return reinterprets the myths of the origins; but at the same time, it projects into the future the return to the origins, as a realization of the eschaton and a renewal of the world. The various programs of freedom and salvation advocated by the prophets are undoubtedly based on the pattern of the myth and appear as a return to the origins. But in reality the rising of messianism and of the mythical "return to the origins" is determined by cultural and environmental factors, and by the cultural, social, and political clash with oppressive powers and institutions. What is the functional and historical significance of this "religion of return"? The return to the origins is the affirmation of a need for escape from 36 Anderson, op. cit., pp. 126-35. 66</page><page sequence="16">the present situation, always one of risk and crisis. But, on the re- ligious ground, the abolition of the present can only take the form of a return to the primordial time. In fact, the religious time, by its static character, is distinct from the profane duration inasmuch as it is without dimensions in the past and without any future perspective in a historical sense. The only past which can be the object of a re- ligious experience belongs definitely to the primordia, to the origins. It is a mythical past, prototypical and outside of history. The future also, in a religious sense, is a messianic and eschatological future, mythical and beyond history. In this regard, the return to a primordial past, as stated by all prophetic movements, is the only possible escape from an unhappy present, and the only accessible form for a renewal of life in a religious sense. On the other hand, the expectation of a future time in which free- dom, happiness, and salvation will be realized against all sufferings gradually develops into a millenarian myth which is the only pos- sible religious solution to the need of evading an unbearable present. The fact is that religious experience tends by its very nature to escape the dimensions of history and the level of civil initiative, and this especially in a society where the priesthood is insufficiently organized. In the collective unconsciousness there is an expectation of an event which is imminent and, at the same time, remote, and which is re- garded as dreadful on account of its revolutionary nature. Thus the escape from a painful present is made mythical in a pri- mordial past and in an eschatological future; in such mythical forms the religious program which reshapes the world in a satisfactory way finds expression. In fact, every prophetic movement has a revolutionary program meant to renew and reform things: in brief, an anticosmic program against the established order. In it is expressed not only a mythical need or a mere nostalgia for a past mythical age;36 there is also a his- 36 Mircea Eliade, the great historian of religions, has recently expressed his evaluation of the millenaristic movements of primitive civilizations ("Dimensions religieuses du renouvellement cosmique," Eranos Jahrbuch, 1960, pp. 241-75). Eliade stresses the general character of renewal of these religious manifestations and the cosmogonic implications of the eschatological and millenaristic myths and of the rituals that are contained in the same religious manifestations. According to Eliade, these religious phenomena are to be placed in the larger and multiform picture of the religious manifestations of renewal, such as the traditional New Year festivals, initiation rites, rites for the instauration of kings, and other ritual manifestations of primitive and ancient religions. The comparison which Eliade makes between the millenaristic cults of primitive civilizations and the many other mythical and ritual manifestations we just mentioned shows in clear light the fundamental analogies of form and meaning among these various religious phenomena, but neglects the differences which are connected with each cultural formation and its existential situation. The "yearning for Paradise" is, according to Eliade, the fundamental idea of the myths and rites of renewal. 67</page><page sequence="17">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology torical dynamism in the prophetic movements which should not be forgotten. The patterns of the age of origins and perfection, proposed in the messianic myths, have value inasmuch as they are as many programs of transformation, and inasmuch as they are capable of nourishing the hope for renewal, and still more, they are in themselves a beginning of rebirth. In conclusion, the most important fact in the prophetic movements is that they contain in themselves a renewal of the religious as well as cultural, social, and political life, and that this renewal takes place as an answer to existential needs which through history have grown within the developing culture. For the followers of these movements the creative future is more important than the nostalgic past, because such movements are in reality new syntheses and in any case in disagreement with the actual tradition. Thus the religion of return appears in history as a creative religion of renewal. What we have said so far, in a "phenomenological" perspective, concerning the prophetic movements at an ethnological level, their millenarian myths, the expectation of salvation and the needs of re- generation expressed in them, holds, no doubt, in the same measure as regards the prophetic movements of great historic religions, and particularly Mosaism, the Jewish prophetism of the Exile, and Chris- tianity itself. In such forms they have given a new life to a religious nucleus which was already present in the "pagan" religions, that is, myths and rites of expectation of salvation.37 In fact, beyond the peculiarities due to the different cultural and historical context in which each movement arises, a genetic nucleus can be recognized, common to all of them, even in the most backward religions. In this sense we believe that there is an uninterrupted continuity of develop- ment between the so-called primitive religions and the great historic religions, including Christianity. So that if one examines them care- fully and without prejudice, one can recognize in them the various ritual and mythical complexes of ancient origin which have been taken again, elaborated, and transformed according to the various cultural and historical developments and to the different and ever re- newed religious and cultural demands. In reality, if we now consider again the objection made by the ethnol- ogist we mentioned at the beginning of this paper against our intent of unifying, for a phenomenological and comparative purpose, under a common "messianic" denominator various phenomena taken from 37 The first author to recognize, from a methodological point of view, the expectation of salvation as the central nucleus of the prophetic movements is Guariglia (op. cit.). 68</page><page sequence="18">the most diverse cultural levels, including the ethnological field, we can see that the preoccupation underlying such an objection is of a subjective, theological nature. Such preoccupation shows, we believe, a dangerous and hidden anti-historical tendency. The danger is that the author, moved solely by an extrascientific concern, may state as a postulate a fundamental difference between religious phenomena which are however historically linked among themselves through a true con- tinuity. In fact, the dichotomy that our author puts between authentic and unauthentic "messianism" is equivalent to the old and outmoded distinction between Naturvolker and Kulturvolker. Any phenomenol- ogy must needs proceed by comparison, and the first step in history is precisely comparison. It is true that after having detected the similari- ties among various phenomena history must also acknowledge their differences and peculiarities, but we shall deal with this problem a little later.38 Now from a merely historical point of view the problem of the so- called authenticity or non-authenticity of a religious inspiration seems to us meaningless. The essential problem is rather that of identifying, by comparing the many messianic movements, their social, cultural, and historical origins: whether they announce the return of the dead or of a culture-hero or someone else, or, finally, of the person of a divine man. A second problem is that of distinguishing according to a progressive historical development the different levels of messianism in relation to the different cultural phases reflected in each of the levels. 38 This "diversity between authentic messianism and all other movements in which there are messianic tendencies only" (Verschiedenheit zwischen echtem Mes- sianismus und alien jenen anderen Bewegungen, die nur tendenziell messianisch sind) is affirmed in Guariglia, op. cit., pp. 26, 33. The author assumes as the essential element of any "true messianic" movement, the presence of a personal messiah who summarizes in himself the entire destiny (the "history") of mankind. With that there could be no disagreement. But it is obvious that the culture-hero, the supreme being, and the dead who are expected to return in the movements of salva- tion of the "primitive" peoples express exactly the "destiny" and "history" of these peoples, as these latter understand and desire it. And therefore it is impossible to state, on this basis, that the messianism of the "great civilizations" (Hochkul- turen) is different from the "religion of expectation" (Heilserwartungsglaube) of the "primitive" peoples. The other difference, according to Guariglia, between "true" messianism and movements of primitive peoples is the role of "mediation" (Vermittlung) the mes- siah holds between men and "God." But this should imply that a "true" mes- sianism can exist only in monotheistic religions, and it would be an evident pre- supposition (cf. ibid., p. 22). Finally, as far as the "historicity" of the person of the messiah is concerned (Guariglia holds that the messiah must be a "historical" person; cf. p. 26), we have shown above that history and myth are constantly interwoven in the movements of salvation, so that mythical persons are believed and expected to return among men in reality ("historically"), and, vice versa, historical persons are mythologized as persons who will come back to life and bring to men the expected paradise. 69</page><page sequence="19">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology In conclusion, our historico-religious comparison enables us, at this point, to identify what appears to be the constant morphological and historical nucleus of messianism: A messianic movement is, in general, a collective movement of escape from the present and of expectation of salva- tion, promoted by a prophet-founder, following a mystico-ecstatic inspira- tion: a movement which intends to start a renewal of the world which will be realized in an eschatological perspective as a return to a primordial and paradisiacal age. In reality, mystico-ecstatic inspirations are peculiar to all prophet-founders, both in primitive religions and in the great historical religions: from Kimbangu to Wowoka, John Wilson, Handsome Lake, Te-Ua, etc. They are fundamental experiences based on one or more visions, trances, or "dreams," etc. From a phenome- nological point of view they are entirely equivalent to phenomena with which we are more familiar, such as the "enlightenment" of Buddha, the "apocalypse" of St. John, the "revelation" of Moses or Jesus. As far as the historical development of messianism is concerned, it is entirely to be referred to the degree of social and cultural develop- ment of the different communities. Among religious cultures of a more archaic type, with a social structure scarcely differentiated, the "mes- siah" assumes more or less impersonal and anonymous forms, like the culture-hero, the supreme being, or the dead. At this cultural level his function is also undifferentiated because he is (or they are, when there is an anonymous multiplicity, as in the case of the dead) merely endowed with the generic magico-creative power attributed to him by the original myth. In the polytheistic religions the "mes- siah" is identified with a "divine person" well defined in its form and differentiated in its function: that is the case among the Polynesians where Lono, the god of agriculture, disappears but will return, bringing prosperity. The polytheistic cultures have an agricultural structure and a society with a definite hierarchy. Progressing from polytheistic civilizations, it is possible to speak of a "messiah" identified in an anthropomorphic sense and, at the same time, as a divine person. An ulterior development can be seen in Jewish messianism (Mosaism). In it the necessity to affirm a pure monotheism over the popular poly- theistic tendency of Canaanean (agricultural) origin results in a theological re-evaluation and reinterpretation of the Jewish history as a praeparatio for an eschaton (final time) when the kingdom of God is to be realized: peace, harmony, and justice for men, and full and sin- cere worship for God beyond any anti-polytheistic controversy. The peculiar character, however, of the first Jewish messianism is not so much the human-divine person of the messiah as rather its monotheis- 70</page><page sequence="20">tic component and the messianic and theological reinterpretation of history.39 Still it is substantially a "national" history. Only through the prophets of the Exile is the ulterior development of messianism realized in a definite universalistic direction. However, it should not be forgotten that such a universalistic development of the entire Jewish religion, forerunner of the Christian universalism, was the historical result of the dramatic experiences the Jewish people had undergone in its massive deportation, in the clash with great powers chaotically engaged in the pursuit of their particularistic interests. From this revolutionary experience and through the prophets, the consciousness of a new mission grew among the "chosen people." The prophets showed the way of salvation in a universalism in which all peoples would be accepted without discrimination. Christianity took again the universalistic idea of the prophets of the Exile and elaborated it again in function of a new religious, cultural, and social crisis. The original national theme is still, however, recognizable: the messiah, whose advent was realized and whose return is expected at the end of time, is "of the root of Isai," that is, of David's family. At the same time, however, Christian messianism faced a new crisis: the moral, intellectual, and individual crisis of a decaying culture afflicted with the problem of its own survival. To solve this crisis Christian mes- sianism offered the way to transcendent salvation. That is really "transcendence"-the peculiar, highest, and unmistakable character of Christian messianism. Such are, in synthesis, the historical and concrete developments of messianism from its embryonic germs at an ethnological level to its most advanced and complex manifestations. Finally we should also answer the question we posed above: on what historical, social, and cultural ground does messianism thrive and give birth to genuine movements of salvation? On the basis of most ample documentation we may state that the announcement of an imminent "savior" or of a complex of beings and events expected to bring prosperity always accompanies and follows situations of extreme distress, crisis, and existential precariousness. Such situations have their origins in disas- trous events such as detribalization, conquest of a country, destruc- tion of cultures (on the part of the whites), collective deportations or 39 See Klausner, op. cit., passim, where the author systematically distinguishes between a redemption through a messiah and a "redemption without a human redeemer" (p. 8); on the other hand, he also distinguishes between a "messianic expectation," vaguely conceived (p. 9) which is the "positive element in the message of the prophets" (p. 21) and the proper "belief in the messiah, in which the political part goes arm in arm with the ethical part, and the nationalistic with the universalistic" (p. 10). 71</page><page sequence="21">Messianism: Its Historical Origin and Morphology catastrophes, etc.; in conflicts against institutions or oppressive groups on the part of rival powers; in clashes among cultures of different levels; and other causes of collective danger which have developed in time. We have said above that there is an unbroken continuity from the "little" prophets of Africa, America, Oceania, and colonial and semi- colonial Asia to the great universal prophets, Moses, Isaiah, and Jesus. All have interpreted in a genuine, spontaneous, and daring way the needs of societies fallen into a state of serious precariousness and have pointed out to their followers a new way to salvation. 72</page></plain_text>
