The Editor reported as follows: REPORT OF THE EDITOR. It has been necessary for financial reasons to continue the publication of the Journal in France with Protat Freres. At the beginning of the year they had in press the 1924 volume and two memoirs, The Folklore of Maryland, and Tewa Tales. The 1924 volume has been issued, and the two Memoirs are in page proof. Volume XVIII of the Memoirs, The Folklore of Maryland, by Annie Weston Whitney and Caroline Canfield Bullock, will be issued immediately. We note with deep regret the recent death of Mrs. Bullock, through whose interest the material for this Memoir was collected and through whose generosity the volume is being printed. Volume XIX of the Memoirs, Tewa Tales, by Elsie Clews Parsons, will be somewhat further delayed. Another Memoir, Lambda Folk-Lore, by Clement M. Doke, a collection of West African Tales, has been placed with a German press through the generosity of Dr. Elsie Clews Parsons. The following officers were elected for 1927: PRESIDENT, Alfred M. Tozzer. FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT, J. R. Swanton. SECRETARY, Pliny Earl Goddard. EDITOR, Ruth Benedict. ASSOCIATE EDITORS, Franz Boas, George L. Kittredge, C.-Marius Barbeau, Elsie Clews Parsons, Gladys A. Reichard. COUNCILLORS: for three years: J. Frank Dobie, Edward Sapir, Frank G. Speck. Other Councillors elected are: for two years: A. L.
