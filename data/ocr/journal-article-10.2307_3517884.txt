<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHAMSUR RAHMAN FARUQI' Constructing a Literary History, a Canon, and a Theory of Poetry: Ab-e IHayait (1880) by Muhammad Husain Azad (1830-1910) It is probably true that modern western writers tend to underestimate the disruptive impact of colonial rule, just as most Indian writers employ it overmuch as a historical deus ex machina. We must remain indebted to each others' correction. -C. A. Bayly (1992:499) The literary career of Muhammad Husain Azad can be described as a triumph of British techniques of management and control in India. The most remarkable as- pect of those techniques was that while the stick was more in evidence than the carrot-and it was a very small carrot anyway-the subject at the receiving entd of the carrot was quite convinced of the salubrious properties of the stick; he actually came to believe that he needed and deserved every inch of it. Most people would tend to describe Mirza 'Abid Husain, the semi-autobio- graphical central character of Mirza Muhammad Had! Rusva's novel ?arWfZadah2 (A Person of Good Family) as a typical new-style Indian gentleman. Of respectable family, impecunious but honest, he is partly self-educated and fully self-made. He manages to go to the famous Engineering School at Roorkie (established by the B ritish in 1844, well before any universities). When he graduates, he obtains a minor job in the engineering department-that is, he becomes a "Government servant," a person of great honor and substance in those days. By dint of honesty, ability, generally good relations with the English, and a slice of good luck, 'Abid Husain succeeds in life, does many good-samaritan deeds, retires from the service at the proper age, and lives happily ever after in affluence with his pliable, virtuous wife. Scrupulous, decorous though not servile with his employers, handy with tools and instruments, devoted "Government servant," humourless, with an active dislike of Urdu poetry, devout, untroubled by questions of identity or change of patronage, Mirza 'Abid Husain would seem to be the perfect prototype of the "loyal," technologically current, politically correct, and "morally sound" individual whom the British wanted to develop in India. But the garif zadah has a certain too-good- * Urdu Monthly Shabkhoon, Allahabad.

He, orhis creator, seems to have all the answers, and all the luck too. I came to read &amp;ar(f zadah when I was a young boy, and even then, surrounded by all the icons of colonial mle at home and school, I could hear a number of false notes in the story. It would have been good for the British (and maybe for India too) if the British could have mass-produced people like 'Abid Husain. But it would have been no real triumph; people like 'Abid Husain were preconditioned in favour of both English education and Eniglish rule. They had nothing to lose and much to gain by it. The story of moulding the Indian intellectual-or at least theNorth Indian Muslimintellectual-to Britishuse was far more complex, and far more grim. 'Abid Husain's dislike of Urdu poetry was, however, typical of the anglicised Indian generations-generations who could descry their past but dimly, and whose future seemed to have been mapped out already by the British. Unlike the somewhat mousy, unimaginative, and colourless 'Abid Husain, the author of Ab-e .Hayat was the son of Agha Muhammad Baqar, a leading Shi'ite Muslim scholar and newspaper editor of Delhi. Muhammad Baqar may or may not have been a close friend of Zauq (1789-1854), one of the three leading poets in Bahadur Shah's Delhi, and Muhammad Husain Azad may or may not have been a constantcompanionandhero-worshippingdiscipleofZauq ' butMuhammadBaqar was undoubtedly a person of intellectual eminence and influence. He threw his weight behind Bahadur Shah in the uprising of 1857, was arrested after the British restoration (1858), and was either hanged or exected by firing squad after a drumhead trial. Azad may or may not have witnessed the actual execution of his father, but he last met or saw his father while the latter was in British custody and Azad and the rest of the family were in fear for their liberty, if not their lives. Azad and his people left home and city with just the clothes on their backs. According to Azad, all that he could rescue from their belongings was a bundle of Zauq's poems (Azad 1967/1982).4 Azad went in fear for his life not just because of his father: Azad himself had composed a highly apocalyptic, superior-sounding, moralistic poem telling the whole world about the reversal of the Christians' (= British) fortune, and their arrogances. He actually seemed to be crowing over the British disarray and loss of morale (see Pritchett 1994:23-4). The poem was published in May 1857, just after the start of the uprising. But the British had long memories, numerous informers, and an elaborate agenda for vengeance. Though the biggest, 1857 was by no means the first popular and organised resistance against the British. They were determined this time to make an example of the rebels. Azad and his family couldn't have hoped for mercy at the hands of the victors; they left, and never came back. No one knows exactly where Azad and his family went from Delhi. His family (consisting of twenty-two persons, according to his account) may have found shelter in the anonymity of some small town near Delhi; Azad himself may have travelled as far to the south as Madras. He seems to have gravitated to the Punjab because of good reports about that part of the country,5 or because an amnesty was declared by the British. Having spent some time in small places, eking out a livelihood, he finally</page><page sequence="3">72 SOCIAL SCIENTST reached Lahore in 1861 and landed a minorjob in the Post Office. In early 1864, he secured a somewhat better position in the Department of Public Instruction (= Education). Azad's peregrinations lasted just a few years, but the transformation that his tribulations wrought in him was profound. Something must have convinced him of the "rightness" of the English cause, and of the moral and intellectual superiority of the British. The superior young man of May 1857 who pontificated about-and sneered at-the vulnerability of the British, became their servant in 1861. In 1864 he graduated to a more suitable job in his preferred field, and shortly afterwards (1865-66) he undertook a trip to Central Asia on behalf of the Government-a trip the objective of which seems to have been to carry out soft espionage. It was truly a case of sartor resartus; but there was still more to come. In 1866, Azad began a long connection with Anjuman-e Panjab, a social-cum- literary society founded in 1865 by G. W. Leitner, a British civil servant in the Department of Education. Azad's reward for his trip to Central Asia seems to have been the Secretaryship of the Anjuman. In 1869, Azad was appointed Assistant Professor of Arabic in Lahore's Government College. The year 1870 saw the arrival in Lahore of Altaf Husain Hall (1837-1914), a disciple of Ghalib's and friend of many notables in the literary world. Both Hall and Azad may by that time have been thinking along "reformist" lines. They may have met often to compare notes and exchange ideas; Hali's employment with the British brought him into touch with English works translated into Urdu, and almost all of what Hall knew about European literature must have come from these translations. While Hall ultimately wrote the major theoretical statement (Hall 1964/[1893])and placed the matter of Urdu poetry firmly on the refornist agenda, Azad went one better: he produced a highly readable, apparenitly sympathetic, but eventually "reformist" account of the development of Urdu poetry.7 With the publication of Ab-e HayJt (Water of Life), Azad became an instant celebrity. He did quite a lot of other, equally superb work afterAb-e .Hayat, but wrote nothing remotely approaching it in staying power. In 1885 he undertook a private trip to Iran, to gather material for his work on Persian poetry. Etven at that time his mind seemed somewhat inclined towards derangement. By 1889 his reason had clearly begun to fail. He was certified in 1890, but continued to write. In fact his account of Persian poetry called SukhandJn-e pars, and his history of Akbar the Great called Darbar-e akbart, were published during his madness, and the latter was almost entirely composed during lucid intervals. Obvious answers have been given to the obvious question: why did Azad go mad?8 Speculation is idle, especially because for a study of Ab-e Hayat we don't really need an answer to the question. Ab-e .Hayat is the product of a very crafty, very brilliant mind, a mind that employs immense resources of innuendo, dramatic invention, and persuasive (though entirely half-baked) theorization to convey its message: If you can't be British, then buy British. There had been no histories of Urdu poetry, or even of Urdu literature, before Ab- e Hayat Detractors of Urdu literature have notched this up as yet another proof of</page><page sequence="4">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 73 the "primitiveness" of the Urdu mind. The reason for the lack of literary histories, however, was not a lack of interest in history. There had been, of course, numerous talkirahs (biographical anthologies) of Urdu poets. Loosely organised alphabeti- cally (if at all), the entries in these anthologies rarely, if ever, recognised thepassage of time as a criterion or category of excellence, or change, or decline. There had been no literary histories before the nineteenth century in Arabic or Persian either. So even if one were to blame the Indo-Muslim mind for being devoid of historical consciousness, one must blame the Arabs and Iranians as well. Yet it was the Arabs who wrote some of the most voluminous histories of the premodem age, and the Iranians didn't lag too far behind. The main reason for the absence of literary histories in Arabic, Persian, or Urdu before the modem age is that the present and past cultural production-literary production, certainly-was viewed in those centuries as existing simultaneously: there was no real past; everything was synchronic. Poetry was conceived as an activity that was just there, like air, and needed no aetiology. The Arabs viewed poetry as timeless; it was always current. Here is Ibn Qutaibah, the ninth-century critic, in his 'Uyun al-akhbar (Reservoirs of Bio- graphical Reports): "Poetry is the mine of knowledge of the Arabs, the book of their wisdom, the repository of their good days, the rampart of their heritage, the tmthful witness on the day of dispute, the final proof at the time of argument" (Lewis 1974:173). And here is Ibn Qutaibah again, in his Kitab ush-shitr va ush-shu'arJ (Book of Poems and Poets), one of the earliest treatises of literary criticism in Arabic: "I do not regard an ancient poet with awe because he is ancient or a modem with disdain because he is modem, but have looked at both with the eye of equity. ... Every ancient was modem in his own time" (Lewis 1974:174). Ibn Qutaibah is concemed with kinds of poetry, the beauties and faults of specific poems, rather than with questions about how past is the past. This healthy disrespect for mere age, or mere modishness, is a theoretical position first adopted, according to Kamal Abu D1b, by Ibn Qutaibah (Abu DIb 1990:343).9 Culturally, however, Arabs had always judged poems on merit, and not as documents in history. Whatever may be the truth about the origin of the Sab'ah mu'allaqat (The Seven Suspended Ones), tradition attributes them to individual poets who werenot exactly contemporary, and yet their poems were woven in cloth at one point of time and hung in the Ka'bah. Questions were not raised about their age. And if, as some modem theorists suggest, these poems grew during oral composition and narration, the narrator "did not memorize precomposed poems, but, aftermastering thematic, lexical, andmetrical possibilities, would compose the poem in the act of performing it" (Sells 1989:14). I need not emphasize the obvious fact that oral poetry does not recognize time.1O Oral poetry is remembered-by the narrator, and also by the listener. It is not just memorized; it is "recalled from out of common sensibility and a common gestalt" (Sells 1989:4). This is an experience that I can testify to, even today. Urdu poetry was bom, and thrived, in a largely oral society. It inherited the characteristics of orality from Arabic and Persian (and the numerous local languages in its own milieu)-and developed quite a few of its own. It is quite common, even in this day</page><page sequence="5">74 SOCIAL SCIENTST and age, for Indo-Muslims to quote poetry freely in conversation and letters. Scant regard is paid to the "authenticity" of the text: one extemporises (consciously or unconsciously) to fill out the metre if the text is not fully remembered. Scantier regard is paid to the "modemity" or "antiquity" of the poet being quoted. A celebrated example of both is the prose of Abu'l Kalam Azad (1888-1958). It is peppered with Arabic, Persian, and Urdu verse-the poet (classical or modem) is rarely named-and the text is frequently inaccurate, though made to sound appropriately literary and metrical by Abu'l Kalan Azad's improvisation. Here is a person (and a people) for whom all poetry is simultaneous. Yet orality is not the only reason why poetry in this culture is not required to have a history. An equally important reason is the existence of the Qur'an in this culture as the supreme exemplar of literary virtue. It is uncreated, yet it is amiracle of textual creation. Poetry therefore tried to approximate to the miracle; literary criticism had its beginnings with the exegetes of the Qur'an who dwelt on the beauties of its language. Even Ibn ul-Mu'tazz, writing his ground-breaking Kitab ul-bqdi' (Book of New Beauty),"1 declared that badt'(verbal devices) had always been there in the discourse of Arab poets and the Qur'an, except for the somewhat artificial quality of "dialectical argument" found in modem poetry. The two greatest books of Arabic liberary criticism are 'Abd ul-Qahir Jurjani's Dala'il ul-a'ijaz (Proofs of the Miracle) andAsrarul-balaghat (Secrets of Appropriateness in Discourse). They are basically concemed with the application of Jurjani's theories of metaphor and poetic structure to the Qur'an.1 It was quite easy for the concept of the Qur'an's etemality to be transferred to poetry as sempiternality: poetry existed at all times; it never went out of interpretive reach. There was no need to bring in mediators from history to make sense of poetry. To be sure, these statements were not made in a formal manner. But the consciousness of the presentness of the past, and its essential indistinguishability from the present, runs through the formulations of Arab-Iranian theorists like a powerful current. It was common for Arab poets to say that we repeat ourselves, or repeat what we have learnt from our forebears. A classical Urdu poet would have understood, and he would agree immediately, for he understood his own poetic work in those very terms.13 Since the Qur'an was the repository of all wisdom, and was also the most beautiful text, it was quite proper to place both the mind and the heart of poetry in the Qur'anic context. This great theoretical leap was made by Amir Khusrau (1253- 1325), India's greatest Persian poet, in the preface to the Ghurrat ul-kamal (New Moon of Perfection),14 a collection of his poems that he compiled around 1294, Khusrau declares himself to be a follower of Sa 'dl (in ghazal), Nizami (in mas'navit), and Sana'i and Khaqani (in qasidah)-all of them Iranian; he denies to himself the title of ustad (master) because he occasionally "fumbles" in the sweetness of "song/ ghazal." He goes on: The essence of poetry is fully in consonance with the essence of knowledge ['ilm] in both word and spirit. In word, because the Qur'an tells us "wa hum la yash 'uruin," that is, "wa hum la ya'lam fn." 15 And in spirit, because it has</page><page sequence="6">CONSTRUCrING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 75 reached us from the holy Prophet: "Undoubtedly wisdom is from poetry." And in the verses of the firm and clear Qur'an, "wisdom" [hikmat] has been used clearly in the sense of "knowledge" ['ilm], as follows: "And he to whom wisdom [hikmat] / Is granted receiveth / Indeed a benefit overflowing" (Ali 1983:109; II:269). Here, "wisdom" means "knowledge." Thus according to this, "poet" means "one who knows" [= aperson of wisdom and learning], and a wise person who is also a poet would, by God, be the greatest of wise men! Going back to this Tradition, "Undoubtedly wisdom is from poetry and undoubtedly magic is from discourse," we find a genealogical tree for the magicians of poetry which rises higher than sidrah and tufbJ,16 because that 17 nightingale of [the garden of] ma zJagh has determined poetry to be the root, and wisdom to be its branch. Who can imagine the exalted station ofhim about whom the incontrovertible Qur'anic verse says, "He who was given wisdom was given the Good in large measure"?18 And the Best of Human Beings [Muhammad] says in the Tradition that wisdom is a category of poetry, and not that poetry is a category of wisdom. For [his words are not that] "doubtless poetry is from wisdom." Thus poetry is superior to wisdom, and wisdom lies deep in the character of the poet. And a poet can be called a philosopher [haktm], but a philosopher cannot be called a poet. [The Prophet] describes magic as from discourse, not discourse from magic. Thus a poet can be described as a magician, but a magician cannot be described as a poet (Khusrau ca. 1294:21-2; translation mine).19 Having achieved this fusion of the human and the divine, the intellectual and the emotional, the everyday and the miraculous, poetry would naturally exist in a timeless mode. Poetry was seen as a separate and distinct system. In a sense, it was seen in isolation "from its cultural, political and economic conditions" and as "a body of 'knowledge' ( 'ilm) superimposed on those conditions." What was im- portant was the mode of creation of knowledge, and not the "vision" of the poet "or the social, political or moral conflicts" adumbrated or discussed by him" (Abu Dib 1979:353). The point made above by Abu Dib is of vital importance, and is the second pillar on which Arab-Islamic literary theory-followed closely by the Iranians and the Indo-Muslims-rests. Poems are not to be judged for their truth or falsehood. Nor are poems imitations or representations of "reality." Neither the Platonic, nor the Aristotelian model of mimesis, imitatio, is relevant here. The Platonic model was metaphysical, moral, and anti-epistemological; the Aristotalian model was psy- chological and pretended to be (pseudo-) epistemological. But since poetry, according to Arab-Islamic poetics, made no pretense of conveying the "truth" (or "knowledge," in the Aristotelian sense of opinion or information based on reality), it need not be put on trial (as Azad and Hal! did to Urdu poetry in the nineteenth century, and as Plato did to all poetry nearly twenty-three centuries earlier in his Republic) and made to defend its continued existence or its acceptance as a useful member of the community. In fact, thequestionof poetry's "truth" (and therefore social relevance, usefulness,</page><page sequence="7">76 SOCIAL SCIENTIST etc.) didn't enter the consideration of Arab-Islamic literary theorists, for two very good reasons. First (and here they are very close to Sanskrit literary theory) they regarded poetry as a game of words-words made truth, or whatever else, but words were what primarily made poems. 'Abd ul-Qahir Jurjani held that metaphors are literally true in the sense that the translation of a metaphor in the same language, or anotherlanguage, doesn't convey precisely the same sense as the original metaphor. So metaphors are to be understood literally. JurJRnI rejected the concept of the "paraphraseability" of metaphorical utterances. Jurjani's great predecessor, Qudamah ibn Ja'far (d. 922) had defined poetry as "metrical, rhymed speech, expressing a certain meaning." Qudamah ibn Jarfar further said that the function of the poet was to bring words and meanings together. That is, utterances could be devoid of meaning, or their meaning could be remote from the words they used, or the words used in the utterance might not be expressive enough. It was the job of the poet to make texts, or to organise words, in such a way as to make them maximally meaningful. Further, the good and bad qualities of poems do not "depend on the moral values or ideas the poet chooses to express, or on the fact that he praises a given subject in one poem and criticises it in another, but rather on the poet's skill in the use of the four constituent elements of poetry: word, meaning, metre, and the use of rhyme" (Bonnebaker 1956:9). 'Abdul-QahirJurjanibuilt on this foundation, and created the elaborate structure of his theory-one in which metaphor came to represent the "meaning of meaning." The poet's job was to create "meaning," and the interpreter elaborated the meaning of meaning. The poet "organised" his words in a special way. (The word nazm was first used in this sense by Jahiz; Kamal Abu Deeb translates it as "construction," though "organisation" seems to be better). This special organisation helped produce meanings and significations; as Jurjani said, metaphor gives the advantage of meaning more things in fewer words.21 According to Tzvetan Todorov, 'Abd ul-Qahir Jurjan! seems to have been the first to examine "in a detailed and unbiased way" the "opposition between symbolic expressions whose new meanings can be established and those in which such a specification is impossible.... Tropes of imagination ... point to no particular object; thus what they state is neither true nor false" (Todorov 1986:82). Thus while Qudamah ibn Ja'far had declared the beauty of poetry to be innate to it, rather than lying in its "moral" or "edifying" qualities, and had suggested that "the best poetry is the poetry which lies most" -that is, poetry which makes maximum use of metaphor- 'Abd ul-QahirJurjani went on to demonstrate that ordinary rules of true or false statement do not apply to poetry. The language of Jurjani, and his successor Sakkaki, is more akin to that of modem theorists on the nature of poetry. In the nineteenth century, however, it was common for colonial educators and teachers in India to hold the view that the Arabic-Persian-Indo-Muslim poets' apparent disregard of "truth" could be ascribed to some moral flaw in their character. As Henri Broms puts it, "The essence of Islamic poetry was not inward dishonesty, 'insinceridad,' as Garcia Gomez argues, but rather does it have its own great central objectives. It created its conceptions of literature, which prove to be distant, though</page><page sequence="8">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 77 indisputable, relatives of twentieth century poetics" (Broms 1972:28). Broms of course says in a complaining tone that the Arabs developedno theory of beauty. For them, poetry meant "poetic devices." They were not interested in "beauty as such." Nor were they concerned with "what poetry could ultimately be or signity." The reason for this should havebeen obvious: Arab-Islamic theorists didn't have a Plato or an Aristotle to give them a guilt complex. Nor were they anxious, like Kant, to develop a theory of beauty that would try to justify the notions of a small minority, and yet pretend to "judge for everyone." The Arabs, and others who followed them, tackled the question of the trutlh or falsehood of utterance in another way too. Arab linguists developed the notion of two kinds of utterance: insha (non-falsifiable utterance) and khabar (falsifiable utterance). Statements that "aim at transmitting information to the addressee" are clearly falsifiable (khabariyah), and those that aim at "actually acting on him or her through language" are obviously non-falsifiable, and are classified as inshJdiyah. A khabariyah statement may also have implications beyond what it says; these may be (depending on the addressee) essential implications. But it could still be falsifiable. An insha'iyah statement, however, aims at "performing an act, such as asking a question, giving an order, or instituting a new state of affairs"; such statements are obviously non-falsifiable (Bohas 1990:128-30).23 Abti Ya'qab SakkI (d. 1228) composed an encyclopedic work that he called Miftdh ul- 'Ullm (Key to all Branches of Learning). This work, which remained the standard textbook on poetics and rhetoric in Indo-Islamic schools for more than four centuries, firmly established the intricate details of khabariyah and inshd'iyah statements.24 It also established the supremacy of non-falsifiable over falsifiable utterances, because of the plenitude of meanings to be found in the inshdeiyah (see Smyth 1986:85-93 for Sakkki's views on this point). In his commentary on Ghalib, Nazm Tabataba'i tells us again and again that insha is superior to khabar.25 But by that time Urdu literature was firmly in the grip of the pursuit of "truth," simplicity of expression, "natural"poetry, social andmoral usefulness, avoidance ofmetaphor, 26 and similar weighty questions. I have devoted so much space to delineating some of the basic ideas about the nature of poetry that were prevalent in the Indo-Muslim world, simply in order to give some sense of the enormity of the task that Muhammad Husain Azad-and Hall, a little later-were trying to perform, and that they almost carried off. To us who are brought up believing solely in the truth of western concepts and ideas about literature and western ways of looking at a people's literary output, it doesn't seem at all outrageous that Azad should have attempted to organise our literary history in the way histories of literature are supposed to be organised. Do not, after all, literatures grow, and develop, and become strong, or feeble, depending on how they deal with the world? Do not the older generations, who are "simpler" in outlook, and "nearer" to "real life," and less "artifice-minded," write a poetry that instantly appeals to the heart? And do not the later generations (unless they adopt new ways and adapt to change) chew and suck at the morsels and bones already chewed and sucked at by their forebears? Do not "decadent" peoples produce a "decadent"</page><page sequence="9">78 SOCIAL SCIENTST poetry? And is not a poetry that is given to "artificialities," that is "unrealistic," "immoral," etc., truly decadent? And do not decadent literatures die, just as senile people do? For such was Azad's agenda inAb-e .Hayat. I have simplified it a bit, but no more than the oversimplifications and downright falsehoods that Azad himself purveyed. Today, this agenda seems the creation of a mind that is somewhat overwrought, but basically sound; to some of us, it may also appear colonialist, and faintly comical. I too would laugh-except for my awareness that the effect and influence of Ab-e .Hayat runs through many Urdu critics' and poets' assumptions about the nature of literature, even nowadays in the 1990s. Indeed, Ab-e .Hayt did what the author (unintentionally, I am sure, but quite properly) had planned for it to do: it gave the Urdu literary community a guilt complex, an inferiority complex, and a willingness to write off most of its heritage as harmful, or false, or both. Here are a few samples of Azad's general descriptions andprescriptions (hereon, all citations forAb-eHayat will just give page references): English has many ideas and themes which our language is unable to convey. That is, their subtlety and delightfulness in English cannot be fully conveyed in Urdu. And this fact is a result of [our] language's feebleness. And it is a matter of great shame for Urdu speakers (80). It is an ancient custom in European countries that the interior and exterior strength of the realm has depended on the personal and educational abilities of the people, and all management of the realm, and all its affairs, were determined by their participation, and the strategies generated by their hard work.... One can imaginehow powerful their discourse andhow mighty their language would be. Against this, if the language of India produced anything at all, it was-during the ascendant good fortune of just one king-a few collections of a few poets-works which are merely appurtenances of light- hearted conduct and entertainment. How can earth and sky be equal? (8 1-2) It is regrettable to say that our poetry is entrapped in the snares of a few petty themes. I mean, themes of loving, wine-drinking and intoxication, creating colour and fragrance based on fancy, without [recourse to actual] flowers and gardens; weeping at the distress of separation, being happy at an imagined, hoped-for union, being disaffected with the [real] world; and on top of all this, [narration of] the heavens' cruelties. And the terrible thing is that even when they [= our poets] wish to narrate a real occurrence, they express these very thoughts though metaphors. My friends, I can see that a whole wonder-house of sciences and arts is open before us, and every people has also put on display the crafts of its literary efforts. Cannot the level where our language stands be seen? Yes, it is quite clear that it lies rolled up in the doormat (100).27 There are just those predetermined themes; sometimes we put forward, or push back, a few words; sometimes we substitute or interchange, and we go on composing [poems]. It is just as if there were mouthfuls already eaten, or chewed, by others; we chew them again, and feel happy (103).</page><page sequence="10">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 79 The masters of the times have decreed unanimously: Urdu poetry is good only for romantic themes, it has no capability and power to convey all kinds of themes. This is abig blot on the skirt of our language; I wonder who should wash it off, and how? Yes, this is the task for our young people who have occupied both banks-eastern and westemr-of the river that flows through the realm ofknowledge. Their adventurous spirit will slake the drought; it will draw water from both banks, and will not only wash off this blot, but will also load the skirt of the people with pearls (104). So ends the introductory part of Ab-e IHayat, leading us into the "first period" of Urdupoetry. This period opens with the joyous words, "It is the first new year's day in the world of Urdu poetry" (105). But in addition to heralding the arrival of a new way to see Urdu poetry, and organising a new view of its past and future, the first hundred-odd pages have accomplished other things as well. They thus deserve a closer look. First of all, there's the subtitle: "Biographies of Urdu poets of renown, and an account of the improvements and reforms made in the Urdu language from age to age. 28This subtitleimmediately creates certain presumptions in the reader's mind: first, that this book makes a definitive statement about who is, or should be called, an Urdu poet; second, that this book tells us about the lives of such Urdu poets as have gained renown; third, that language (especially the Urdu language) is like a human being-specifically, a growing child: its "power" grows with age, it is amenable to "improvements," it needs "reforms" and "reformers," and it has been "reformed" and "purified" with the passage of time. The book therefore sets up a tremendously high horizon of expectation. The amount of authority and influence it exercised from the very beginning can only be imagined. We must remember that at that time, none of the older ta2kirah anthologies were available in print. The few recent ones-some of which were in Urdu-that were available in print didn't pretend to give a biographical or historical account of the poetry. They said little, if anything, about the origins of the Urdu language and its various stages and locales of development. The only exceptions were Fallon and Karimudddin's Tabaqat-e shu'ara-e hind (compiled 1847, first published Delhi 1848), and Safa Badaytni's Shamrm-e sukhan hissah-e avval (The Fragrance of Poetry Part I) (first published 1872). It is doubtful that the latter was well known. The former seems never to have acquired much credibility: it claims to be a translation, byFallon and Karimuddin, of Garcin deTassy'sHistoire de la litterature hindoui et hindoustani (Tassyl839-47). F. Fallon-not to be confused, as did Garcin de Tassy, with the lexicographer T. W. Fallon-seems little known as a scholar of Urdu. There are numerous misreadings ofnames both Indian and western, and the language is, to say the least, pedestrian and even faulty in places. Thus, to all intents andpurposes Azad's work is the first of its kind in almost all the important ways. Somewhat naturally, it became the most authoritative, not least because it is a supremely beautiful work of creative prose-dramatic in its narrative impact, and almost magical in its evocative power. While none of Azad's successors could even approach his work in beauty, its scheme, and its manner of treatment of material, set</page><page sequence="11">80 SOCIAL SCIENTIST the pattem for future writers-a pattem that has not been quite broken even now. Who are the people deserving the title of "Urdu poets," and who are the "Urdu poets of renown" whose biographies are supposed to adom this work? Apparently Azad appointed himself sole arbiter in these matters. Hail, in a characteristically mild and laudatory review (in Muhammad Isma'il Panipati 1968:II,184-94) of Ab- e .Hayat, pointed to the omission of Momin Khan Momin (1800-50), Zauq and Ghalib's great contemporary; and also of Nizam ud-Din Mamnnun (d. 1844), a poet of such note that his absence from this world was lamented by Ghalib even many years after his death.29 Hall didn't make any comment at all on the omission of the great poets from Gujarat and the Deccan, not to mention Bihar and Bengal. For after all, Hall too was helping to establish the canon that Azad was promulgating. In the next edition, Azad remedied the omission of Momin. He gave the feeblest of reasons for the original omission; the real reason will perhaps never be known, although there have been speculations. But he made no amends for the omission of Mamnmin. Mamnun was a poet of whom Hall thought well-he quoted him with obvious approval in the Muqaddamah30 and whom the prestigious Sahba'i (1806-1857) had includedinhis anthologyIntikhab-e davavln (firstpublished 1844).31 The result of Azad's high-handedness is that in spite of MamnUn's contemporary and extant reputation, his noble lineage, and his excellence as a poet, he is practically unknown today. It is not that Azad had no information about the Urdu literature produced in the Deccan. He might not have known, or even known about, the Gujri Urdu poets of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries; but he surely knew about some of the major Dakani and Guj arati Urdu poets. Many of them find place in Karimuddin's Tabaqdt. Lachhmi Nara'in Shafiq's Chamanistan-e shu'ara( 1762), and even in the arrogant, chauvinistic Mir's Nikjt ush-shu'arj (1752). The fact that many tazkirahs were at Azad's disposal is bome out by internal evidence from Ab-e .Hayat The modern edition of one such taikirah, Majmu 'ah-e naghz-composed by Qudratullah Qasim in 1806, and edited by Mahmtd Sheranl-is actually based on Azad's own copy. Azad mentions Sa'di Dakani, Ahmad Gujrati, and Seva [96-97]. His tone is dismissive, if not disdainful. He also quotes a verse from a poet called Hamid. (No one else except Qasim seems to have mentioned him; Azad has almost reproduced Qasim's exact words on Hamid.) The verse from Hamid is in the rekhtah mode- that is, a mode of composition in which one uses a deliberately free mixture of Urdu and Persian. Hamid's verse is no better or worse than the rekhtah examples quoted by Azad on the previous page. But then Azad goes on to say, If these are poetry, then the Punjab [can be said to have] contributed numerous poets from that time to this. The poetry here [in Punjab] continues to this day in this strain. But those poets and their poetry are not matters that we are talking about. Ahmad Gujrati is a contemporary and compatriot of Vail.32.. There has been an author in the Deccan called Seva . . . probably there have been many more such poets in those ages, but such poetry cannot be described as learned [97-98].</page><page sequence="12">CONSTRUCrING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 81 This marginalisation of all poetry except what was produced around Delhi, or at courts in nearby areas, dates back to Mir (1722-18 10), who began his taikirah by saying that Urdu poetry originated in the Deccan, and who then went on to use extremely derogatory language about the poets of that part of the country. Still, he promised, he would write about some of them in due course (Mir 1972:23). Later in the book, he reiterated his poor opinion of the Dakani poets, but mentioned some notables. "The rest didn't even versify properly, so what pretension could they have to writing poetry?" (Mir 1972:90; translation mine). Qa'im Chandpuri (1722/25- 94) differed with Mir in his own taikirah, Makhzan-e nikat (1755), and included many Dakanis in it. Unfortunately, the text of Qa'im's tazkirah remained comI- paratively unknown for a long time. (It was first printed in 1929.) The text of Qa'im's that did become well known-and even in fact notorious-was a verse of his made famous through its inclusion inAb-e Hayat. Azad observed, "Everybody agrees that the present [Urdu] poetry made its first appearance in the Deccan." A couple of sentences later, he quoted Qa'im, without comment on the derogatory nature of the quote, but quitenonchalantly, in proof of his statement that Urdu poetry was born in the Deccan: Qa'im, it was I who gave rekhtah the manner of the ghazal. Otherwise it was but a feeble thing in the language of the Deccan [98].33 But this is Azad's style: he cooks your goose without your being aware of anything amiss. Not for nothing is he Urdu's most subtle and delightful prose writer. Mas'Ud Hasan Rizvi Adib defended Azad for his neglect of Dakani by saying, "Azad has kept the distinction between Dakhini and Rekhtah or Urdu in view, and has detennined Vali to be the first poet of Urdu, Inot Dakhini." Rizvi Ad-b also quoted Grierson, who described Vali as the "father of Rekhta." He went on to quote extensively from the then little-known prose work of Baqar Agha (1745-1806) of Vellore, perhaps the greatest Dakani literary figure of the eighteenth century, to the effect that Val! is the "leader and master of all in the creation of the ghazal of rekhtah" (Rizvi 1953:24-6). Apart from the fact that RizvI Adib's argument is mere quibbling, it is also inaccurate and ahistorical. The point is not whether Grierson or Baqar Agha considered Rekhtah and DakanI to be separate languages. They did not; but even if they did, it only proves that they made a mistake. Rekhtah is the name gi ven to Urdu, like numerous other names, at different times. True, it doesn't seem to have been used for Dakani, but that proves nothing. Even Azad knows that Rehhtah and Dakani are the same language. Qa'im's verse that he quotes proves this knowledge. But he makes a direct statement as well: introducing the "period" of Val!, he says, In this period, Val! is certainly the lamp of the gathering, and the members of the assembly are noble and well-bom people of Delhi and the Deccan, of proper speech. Whatever they see, they see by the illumination of that very</page><page sequence="13">82 SOCIAL SCIENTIST lamp. 7heir language should be regarded as one and the same (Azad 106; emphasis mine). Discussing Val! in his own right, Azad says, In the Poet of Nature's collection of poems, there are numerous themes, each newer than the other. But this subtle point is no less than any: that the lamp of poetry should be lit in the Deccan, and its stars should rise in Delhi's sky [112]. So Azad was writing a history of Urdu-and not merely Delhi Urdu-poetry. In any case, by the time Azad wrote, Dakani was well recognised as a dialect or form of Urdu. The poetry in GujrI was perhaps not well known then, but no one after Mir, Qa'im, Qudratullah Qasim, and KarimuddIn could pretend not to know about Dak-anI as a form or dialect of Urdu. Even Baqar Agha, from whose preface to his own poem Gulzar-e 'ishq Mas'tUd Hasan RizvI AdIb has quoted copiously to "prove" that DakanI and Rekhtah are two languages, clearly treats Rekhtah as a form of Dakani, or DakanI as a stylistically earlier form of Urdu. Rizvi Adib has neglected, by oversight apparently, to quote some vital words of Agha's. Thephrase RizvI Adib does quote, about Vali's primacy, is the second half of a full sentence. Agha in fact writes, "Just as Zahuri has been, in Persian prose and verse, the originator of a new style, Val! Gujrati is anterior to and master of all, in the creation of the ghazal of Rekhtah" (Saba Navidi 1994:143-4).? So Adib's strongest advo- cate in defence of Azad avails him little, for Agha treats Val! as the inventor of a new style, not as a poet in a different language. If Azad is airy and insouciant about Dakanl, and ignores a number of majorpoets of Delhi, he seems almost entirely unaware of literary production in Bengal and Bihar,3s although Qasim's taikirah, one of his main sources, freely includes poets from Patna and Murshidabad, and gives the impression that these cities were then among the main centres of Urdu poetry. Women and non-Muslims fare even worse. There is only one Hindu poet in the whole galaxy. He is the famous Daya Shankar NasIm (1811-43) of Lucknow. Azad still manages to say or imply uncomplimentary things about him [308-9]. And Nasim is mentioned not in proper historical sequence, but with Mir Hasan (1738/ 39-86)-with whom he has no connection. A few more Hindus, a couple of Europeans, do flit across the pages like "extras" in a film-thev're there to provide some colour. But judging from Ab-e H-Iayat, the contribution of Hindus to Urdu poetry would appear to be infinitesimal. From the eighteenth century Azad omits many major, or interdisciplinary, or interesting Hindus like Raja Ramn Nath Zarrah, Ray Prem Nara'in Aram, Savb Sukh Dlvana, Aftab Ray Rusva, and Ray Tika Ram Tasalli. Sarb Sukh Divana, of noble family, fully bilingual in Urdu and Persian, was the ustad of such ustads as Ja'far 'All Hasrat. Qasim says that "there would hardly be anyone in Lucknow who would not consider Dlvana an ustJd'(Qasim 1972:68). It's funny that Azad borrowed so much from Qasim, but forgot to take Hindus or women. Sarb SukhL Divana is less known today than many minor figures like</page><page sequence="14">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 83 Muhammad Ahsan Ahsan, or Ghulam Mustafa Yakrang, or Mir Makkan Pakbaz, whom Azad's magic wand has immortalized. Azad ignores women even more blatantly. True, there were no major women poets in Urdu before the twentieth century, and Azad was writing about "poets of renown." Butthis argument is circular,becauseitwas Azad alone who determined- for the purposes of Ab-e Hayat at least-who should be considered a "poet of renown." Today, we know many as "poets of renown"' only because they were noticedby Azad inAb-e Iayd . And there are many, like the poet, sufi, musicolo- gist, andphilosopher 'Abdul-ValI 'Uzlat (1692/3-1775) whom even Mir recognized as a major figure, but who are unknown today because Azad ignored them (Mir 1972:90,92). So it is quite possible that a well-known woman poet like Mah Laqa Chanda (1766-1834) would today be a "poet of renown" if Azad had chosen to put her in his gallery of "walking and talking pictures" [111. That Mbh Laqa Chanda's was no mean presence can be judged from Qasim, one of Azad's main informants. Qasim says of her, Chanda: Dancing girl, beautiful, her name is Mah Laqa. It is reported that she lives in great opulence in Hyderabad. She has nearly 500 soldiers and other servants in her employ. She pleases the heart with her coquetry and fine manners, but does not deign to notice all and sundry. Poets who are greedy and inferior in quality write herpraises and are rewarded by her. She does physical exercises and rides horses, like mien. Abandoning practice with the slings and arrows of her eyelashes, she comes out in the field and practices with the bow and arrow and the lance. She is extremely wise and mature, a rarity of the age. She has put together a collection of poems comprising all genres, and arranged according to the end-rhyme. She is a disciple of Sher Muhammad Khan Inan (Qasim 1972:48-9; translation mine). Well, if there was ever a poet colourful enough in character and achievement to enhance the glory of Ab-e IHayat, it was Mah Laqa Chanda. But she didn't make the grade. Maybe because she was a dancing girl. If that was the problem, an equally good candidate would have been Gunna Begam (d. 1773). Her takhallus has been reported as Muntazir and/or Shokh. Bluest of blue in blood, daughter of a leading nobleman, and married to the Prime Minister of the Emperor of Delhi, she was one of the most beautiful women of her tinme; she was so delicate that she reportedly died of shock when she drank brackish instead of sweet water while thirsty during ajoumey. She was famous throughout the realm as a poet. expert in extempore composition. She was also a wit and a patron of poets. Even the crowded history of eighteenth-century India has no one to match her. Obviously, she wasn't good enough for Azad. Then, in the nineteenth century, there was Shah Jahan Begam Shritfi (1838- 1901), ruling princess of Bhopal, well-known poet and patron of the arts. Azad doesn't recognise her either. His bias seems to have been against women, not against any particular kind of woman. Maybe women didn't fit into his neat "periods," especially if they were fromi Hyderabad or Bhopal. Azad's centre of gravity is Delhi,</page><page sequence="15">84 SOCIAL SCIENTIST and then Lucknow. Sometimes he neatly conflates time and space, as in the case of Vali, who was a Gujarati (or Deccani) but who comes alive only when he reaches Delhi. But Gunna Begam was Delhi-born, and daughter of a leading nobleman and poet of Iranian origin. Perhaps being a woman was a fatal disability in Azad' s eyes.36 He says next to nothing about wives and daughters in Ab-e .Hayat. Two themes derived from historical linguistics-or from whatever passed in Azad's mind forhistorical linguistics-aremajor overtones inAb-e.Hayat . The fact that Azad pressed them into service for constructing a literary theory must be classed as a triumph of ingenuity. Urdu, according to Azad, is derived from Bhakha (that is, Braj Bhasha); and lan,guages grow and change, and acquire bad characteristics, contract diseases. They need to be controlled, cured, reformed, kept on the right track, the way human babies do. In fact, the images of language as a child, language as a youth, language as a full-grown man at the height of his powers, language as an ageing man with powers on the decline-the whole gamut of anthropomorphic apparatus-play a major part in framing our notion of the book. In the very first two paragraphs Azad introduces such images: I was wonderstruck by the fact that a child-waif should be found wandering in the bazaars of Shah Jahafn, and the poets should pick him up and nurture hirn in the dominion of poetry under their care. Their instruction and correction from time to time took the child by the hand and made him walk forward, step by step. Azad was not the first to say that Urdu was derived from Braj Bhasha. The view seems to have been common in Urdu literary circles far and wide. For example, here is Baqar Agha, in his preface to his poem Gulzar-e 'ishq (1795-96), long before Azad: In India,37 the Hindi language, commonly called Braj Bhakha, had been current for a long time. Although its truest of true roots, and the source of arts and fundamental rules and sub-rules, is the Sanskrit language, later on, Arabic and Persian words began to enter the idiom of Braj over a period of time, and the typical style andmanner of Braj began tobe lost. This [resultant] language was called Relhtah38because of this intermixing (Saba NavIdi 1994:143)39 This theory is historically unsound, and Azad should have known better. Perhaps he adopted it because it suited his agenda. He had a notion (not held by him alone, at the time) that the poetry in Braj is simple, heartfelt, non-metaphorical, not given to exaggeration, and so forth. Whereas Urdu poetry, by the time of Ab-e Hayat1 has become artificial, metaphorical (or given to metaphoric excess), and therefore unsuitable for real poetic activity. The truth was quite different, and Azad's own examples and samples from Braj prove it. But consistency was not Azad's strong point-nor that of Hali, the other great westemiser and "reformer" in Urdu. Azad tells us that Bhasha, when it describes something, explains to us its essential feel and its actual state in such a way and through such sensory details as can be felt only by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting</page><page sequence="16">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 85 or touching that thing. Though such utterance doesn't have the might of hyperbole or the tumult and bustle of high passion, the hearer derives the same pleasure from hearing about it as he would obtain from seeing it [681. After making this hair-raising statement in praise of Bhasha, Azad devotes a few pages' worth of scintillating prose to generalised sneers about the abstraction and unrealism, and so on, of the poets of Iran (who are the prototype of Urdu poets) and to highly fanciful summaries of the characteristics of "our" (Iranian/Urdu) literary styles as opposed to "Indian" ones. He has a faint realisation, then, that the imaginary sample of Bhasha poetry that he has displayed is itself full of hyperbole and metaphor, even if of a different kind. So he makes a tumabout and says that the reader shouldn't imagine that there is no hyperbole in Sanskrit. The main point, he says, is that the poetry of each different country reflects the geography and culture and customs of its country of origin. Our elders used the ways of Persian to gain metaphorical excellence, and power of expression, of a degree higher than that of Bhasha; but in so ;ng they threw away a "natural flower"-that is, "emotional effect in discourse, and realism in expression" [68-77]. The general principles of English writing, we are informed on the next page, are that "you should describe a thing, or the feelings of 'our heart, in such a way that your utterance should produce the same pleasure, or sorrow, or anger, or pity, or terror, or passion in the heart [of others] as would happen to them on experiencing or seeing that state" [78-79]. The naivete and falseness of these statements need no analysis; nor do we need to trace the origin of these ideas in English literary theory. The point that must be made, however, is threefold. First, Azad's agenda here has a nativistic tilt; it is also a subtle attempt to wean Indo-Muslim literary producers away from Iran (and Arabia). Second, it satisfies the demands of the westernisation project by making a remark about "English writing" that is, in fact, almost a duplicate of Azad's earlier remark about poetry in Bhasha. Third, it strikes a blow in favour of simplicity, non- abstractness of expression, emotion-rousing effect, and "realism" in poetic discourse. Azad made even more subtle use of his theory of growth and change in languages (particularly Urdu). He was trying to write the history of poetry in a culture that didn't recognise historical change in literature. He wanted to impose a pattern and an organising principle on material that must have seemed inchoate to his modern (post- 1864) sensibility. But there was no sense of history here, no consciousness of change, especially since the advent of Va4l, whom Azad made the grand progenitor of Urdu poetry. The change, if any, had occurred when the "Indian style" of Indo- Persian poetry permeated through the veins and sinews of the stripling Urdu poetry, about the -middle of the sixteenth century. Even then there wasn't much change, because Urdu poetry was after all Indian, and we are talking about the Indian style of Persian poetry. On top of this, there was the natural resistance to change, or conscious recognition of change and an insistence on continuity, which is the hallmark of Indo-Muslim culture. InNikat ush-shu'arJ (1752), the earliest taikirah of Urdu poets, Mir defined rekhtah (Urdu poetry) as "poetry in the manner of poetry in Persian, and in the language of the exalted court of Shahjahanabad, Delhi" (Mir 1972:23). This delimitation by the greatest Urdu poet of the eighteenth century-</page><page sequence="17">86 SOCIAL SCIENTIST and perhaps the greatest Urdu poet of all time-flatly fixes the parameters of Urdu poetry. It recalls the diktat ofthe EdinburghReview (1802): "The standards ofpoetry have been fixed long ago by certain inspired writers whose authority it is no longer lawful to call in question" (Cowl 1914:272). To be sure, the pronouncement of the Edinburgh Review is not typical of English literary culture. But it would have made sense to Mir. What would have made sense to Azad was a statement like Ben Jonson's, in his Discoveries ('1620-35): "Nothing is more ridiculous than to make an author a dictator, as the schools have done with Aristotle.... Let Aristotle and others have their dues; but if we make further discoveries of truth and fitness than they, why are we envied?" (Cowl 1914:5 1). Jonson spoke in the voice of the European renaissance. Azad's new masters wouldn't always go that far, but they would endorse the spirit of Jonson's remarks. But what "further discoveries of truth" could Azad make from a material that wasn't amenable to his view of our literary past? As William L. Hanaway says in his interesting paper, "Is there a Canon of Persian Poetry?", the medieval Iranians- read "Indo-Muslims" here, for our purposes-"knew what the world was": They understood that society was to be ordered in a certain way, and that no other way was viable.... They understood that poetry was to be written in a certain register of language which they might let fray a bit around the edges, but whose essence they maintained intact. Furthermore, they shared a narrow and conventional rhetoric which allowed human relationships to be defined in certain terms. The case about rhetoric is overstated a bit, but isessentially a fairpresentation of the Persian-Indo-Muslim literary environment. Hanaway denies that a canon of poetry can develop in such an environment. While this can be debated, there's no denying the truth of his assessment that there was no "social, intellectual, political, or ideological change" to bring in a change of standards or literary canon in Iran (Hanaway 1990). In India, there was political change, but the notional authority of the Emperor at Delhi continued to cast its shadow until 1857, and it provided a vital sense of continuity. To be sure, the world changed in India after 1857. But before 1857, there may have been a conisciousness of decline and decay (although that too was a poetic convention, for the poet could always assume the role of outsider- commentator), but there was no sense of fundamental change. So Azad's problem was how to show change where no change was visible. He wrote beautiful-if somewhat cutesy-prose to introduce each of his five "Periods" ofUrdupoetry. He announced theseperiods almost with his first breath inAb-el.ayat (on the second page of the preface, in fact [8]), and tried his best to incline the reader'smindtoward them. But thecarefully crafted introductions to theperiods are mere glittering generalities, full of dramatisations and apostrophes. There's very little substance, and very little real distinction. From the introduction to the First Period: No doubt their idiom will be ancient, and their themes too will often be lightweight and of an everyday nature.40 But the simplicity and spontaneity</page><page sequence="18">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 87 of their discourses feel so good to the heart, as if there were an innate, God- givenbeauty, and itsnatural excellencewereproducing the effect of thousands of embellishments and adornments [ 106-107]. Now look at this extract from tlhe introduction to the Second Period: You'll see, through their unadomed words and free and easy speech, they will express whatever occurs to their heart, with such spontaneity that they will present a picture before the listener. And so long as they listen, the listeners will keep their hand on their breast, clutching their heart. So what's the reason? That very spontaneity before whose simplicity a thousand elegances will give up the ghost [136-137]. In the Third Period, poets allowed their "high-flying nature to reach upward." Azad exclaims, "Would that they had marched forward, and gone out of the narrow courtyard of beauty and love! " [ 159]. So what price change and development? If the poets remained confined to the narrow courtyard of love and beauty, then in what way did poetry change? A little before expressing this pious wish, Azad tells us, You'll find the skirt of their perfection tied to the skirt of Doomsday. In their artifice, they'll give way to a tiny bit of elaboration too, but just so much as a dewdrop on the rose, or a mirror on a picture.41 Even their elaborateness will enhance the pleasure of pure [natural] delicateness to some extent [159]. B y now Azad could see that the agents of change weren't cutting much ice with Urdu poetry. So he devotes the remaining eight or nine pages of his introduction to the Third Period to listing petty and inconsequential changes in the language. He gives examples of words from this very period, and not the earlier period, that he regards as archaic. In his introduction to the Second Period, he gave a list of about ten usages from the previous period that, according him, had become archaic during this one. Now, however, he gives no list of archaisms from the Second Period. That is, he couldn't find even archaisms to show that there was some change between the Second Period and the Third Period. In the introduction to the Fourth Period, there is an emphasis on laughter, and joking, and playful creativeness. "But the poets of this period will never take steps of progress, nor raise higher the existing buildings" [280]. The laughter and joking refer to Insha'allah Khan Insha (1753-1817), and to a certain extent to Sa'adat Yar Khan RangIn (1756-1834). But in no way can the entire Period (if period it is) be described as the period of laughter and buffoonery; and it is oversimplification to reduce Insha and Rangin to the status of circus clowns. Both were persons of extraordinary genius and made major contributions to Urdu literature. Yet ulti- mately, the image of Insha and Rangin "jumping and gambolling on the old balconies and terraces" [280] like monkeys is all that Azad leaves with us. For there was no real progress or change, vertically or horizontally, in this Period either, as Azad himself tells us. The remaining four pages of the introduction are given, as usual, to citing examples from this Period of usages that, according to Azad, have become archaic.</page><page sequence="19">88 SOCIAL SCIENTST We are now in, the Fifth and last Period. In this Period, Azad informs us, there are many who are content to nurture, and prune, and keep in order, the garden that they inherited. There are some others who didn't go out in any direction in the limitless expanse around them. From the high-storied buildings, they flew away up above. Thus you'll see that some high flyers will attain to such heights where the sun would be like a mere star. And some will fly so high that they'll have flown away [405]. In other words, they will be very like those of the Third Period. Let's just recall the words Azad had used about these earlier poets: they "allowed their high-flying nature to reach upwards" and did not, alas, "march forward" [159]. So there's not much change or development really. This introduction has a few remarks about Delhi-Lucknow differences, based on usage, and a very short list of archaisms. One doesn't need a close reading of the five introductions together to be struck by the fact that the changes, if any, have been in the language, not in the poetics or the worldview. And I know of no other critic, even in Urdu, who places a negative qualitative value on usages that become archaic. If there is one aspect of the poetry of earlier ages that Azad dislikes consistently, it is the words and phrases that, according to him, are no longer in use. He seems actually to blame older poets for writing a language that is no longer current. He is a great champion of a style free from what he calls "ostentation and artificial devices." He is, for example, a great admirer of Mir Soz, whose language, he says, has "an extraordinary sweetness." He praises him-with only one reservation: The beauty of his literary style is entirely free42 of ostentation and artificial devices. It is an example of the kind of beauty displayed by a rose on a verdant branch, when it forms a kind of cup, and shows, surrounded by deep green leaves, its true youthful vigor. Those people of insight to whom God has given eyes to see, know that the adomments of thousands of artifices sacrifice themselves before one innate beauty. However, in his ghazals, after two or three verses one or two archaic words indeedprick the bixain. Well, we ought to ignore them. "Think properly-is there a rose anywhere that doesn't-have a thom?" [236, italics mine] So poor Mir Soz is rapped on the knuckles-for writing according to the idiom of his times, a thing thathe could not avoid doing. Thepatronising tone of the italicised sentences, and the concluding line quoted from Hafiz, are truly galling. But Urdu people seem to have taken it-and even worse, taken it quite calmly. Perhaps themost curious-yet rnost natural, if one stops to think about it-aspect of Azad's view of old, archaic usages is that they are a function of bad poetry, or just plain bad literary values. That is, if you produced literature according to Azad, your I anguage will not become quickly archaic; the reason the language of the older Urdu poets became archaic so quickly is that their poetry itself was obsolescent: Today most of our contemporaries laugh when the come across the language of those times [of Vali's]. But it is no occasion for laughter. This is how it has</page><page sequence="20">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 89 always happened in this world of events and change. Today you laugh at their language, tomorrow there'll be others who will laugh at your language. If the members of this Assembly of Heedlessness were to appoint Far-seeing Wisdom their President, then it would be an opportune time to think up strategies about how we should shape our discourse, so that our languagemay remain popular among the people a little longer. Although there is darkness in front of us, we should look back and consider the question: the progress that the languagehas achieved, has been according to what principle, and in which direction has it been striding? Come on, let us too give thought to the state of the matter today and its future shape, and direct our steps accordingly. Maybe a few years will be added to the life of our poetic discourse [ 1 1 1-1 12]. So if poetry were to address itself to contemporary problems and needs, its language would run less risk of becoming archaic. Otherwise, derisive laughter and quick oblivion are staring it in the face. Azad has another grand principle: as languages grow old, their literature moves away from positive sweetness and natural simplicity, and becomes elaborate, ornamented, sophisticated. There should then be renewal-or death: This calamity, the Last Period, is not peculiar to our language alone. Set the ancients of Persian before its latter-day writers; compare the Arab poets of the jahiliyyah [period before Islam] with those who came after them. English I do notknow, but I know this much: the latter-day writers of English too complain of the same pain. It is thus seen that language pours out cups of milk and juice only so long as it is in its early youth. When it becomes mature in years, it introduces additives of fragrance and essence into the pure drink, looks for elaborately distilled attars. Then, naturally, its qualities of simplicity and sweetness of tone mingle with the dust; what remain are cupfulls of medi- caments. Let whoever wishes drink of them [406]. Azad doesn't realize that every age is thelast age for those who are in it, and there is no law that language (which in Azad's terms here means poetry) must move from simple to complex. Nor is it necessary that sophistication and complexity of expression are bad. However, since Azad's masters seemed to regard all Urdu poetry as insufferably and unprofitably complex, and therefore remote from life, Azad had to say that complexity, metaphor, and verbal finesse are decadent, while simplicity and naturalness are pristine. It was therefore also necessary to equate literature with language, and to postulate that languages become moribund when their literature becomes old. In the case of Urdu, Azad clearly saw its poetry as dead. It was therefore necessary to give the call for a "new" language, so that a "new" poetry (and other discourses) could be brought into being. All language is thus parole; there isno langue. Language is the handmaid of civilisation: it is the creation of ustads who supervise and control its growth. The envoi to Ab-e .Hayat is one of the best pieces of prose that I have ever read. It has something of Thomas Browne in it, and something of Shakespeare. The beauty of the prose helps gloss over contradictions of thought and feeling. Still, one</page><page sequence="21">90 SOCIAL SCIENnST thing is clear: Azad is in love with the old poetry, but also wants it dead. He wants its death so badly that he actually believes it is dead. He is like the rich heir who loves his old father, but is impatient for him to die, so that the older order may change, yielding place to the new. Who knows-Azad may have taken the death of classical Urdu poetry as one of the ways in which God manifests Himself. "It is not the Fifth Period that is over," Azad declares at the very beginning of his envoi, "India's old and cordial comrade-that is, the old poetry-is also over. The stream of its progress does not flow." The old masters will live on in their poems, Azad concedes. Their works are "homes peopled by them." But the age of their poetry was, alas, all too brief. Although many of the mansions that they built are "for the assembly and accession of love and beauty alone, they used materials in them that can be put to other uses" [645-6471. Near the end of his stirring apostrophe to the dead masters, Azad says-in a tone that to me sounds unforgivablypatronising, and straight out of the mouth of someone like Lord William Bentinck -"We will take out from its place the stone that you carved in relief and inlay, and installed for decoration alone. We'll touch our eyes to it in thanksgiving, and will use it to beautify such an arch as may strengthen a palace of the realm with its sturdiness, and may gladden hearts with its comeliness" [648]. So the poetry, which was described at the beginning of the envoi as dead, but living in the pages of the great masters, is ultimately found to be a dilapidated home for ghosts, awaiting the wrecker's ball. For all his cutesy cockiness, I think the Azad of Ab-e .Hayat is a tragic figure. There is no doubt that he loved the old poetry-at least most of it-and loved the culture that produced it-again, at least most of it. In spite of all his spicy wit, delicate or outrageous wordplay, malice (aforethought or unplanned), powers of dramatic evocation. and hypnotically smooth flow of prose, I think he wears black in his heart. But was he convinced that the old poetry must go-was in fact gone-; and that it deserved to go? Or did he want to play obedient piper to the English tune? And if the latter, did he do so because he was persuaded that that was the only way to survive. or because he wanted to be known as a loyal subject of the British crown and of its concepts of enlightenment? Or was he fighting a readguard action, trying to retrieve whatever he could flrom the old culture? I think the whole truth will never be known, and it may perhaps be a mixture of all the possibilities that I have suggested. Sad he was at the passing of the old configuration, but the Azad who slipped away from Delhi in 1858, in fear forhis life, spiritually echoed Malcolm's words in Macbeth (II,3,151-152): "There is warrant in that theft / Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left." He was not the same Azad who undertook asoft espionage tour in 1865-at the behest of the very English who had executed his father as a traitor, and who had hanged or shot dead Muhammad Ism'ail, the only son of his beloved mento Zauq, on similar charges ('Alvi 1992:41). The Azad who gave the clarion call for reform in Urdu poetry in 1874 (Pritchett 1994:34) was someone else again; but he was closer to the world of Ab-e IHayat (a work begun in 1872) which was, in some sense, a world of hope and rejuvenation. The younger Azad was a fugitive, but intent upon saving the poems of his master Zauq, the master Doet. Azad's choosing to save that one object from</page><page sequence="22">CONSTRUJCTNG A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 91 his crowded home was a symbolic act; the home and its traditions, he seemed to be saying to himself, are now lost. The poems too cannot live without the home. Perhaps someday I'll mummify and preserve them for posterity. Unfortunately, Azad did his job only too well. He abruptly terminated the story of Urdu poetry with Salamat 'All Dabir (1803-75) and Babr 'All AnTs (1802-74), both of Lucknow, both originally from Delhi. (Note the symbolism again.)" He did not include any living poet, for that would falsify the dominant note of his threnody: classical Urdu poetry was dead. No hint of its continued existence should be given, for that would hamper the work of giving it another, more appropriate avatar. At the time of Ab-e IHayat's first appearance, there were at least seven major poets who were directly in the tradition of the old masters. But he chose to ignore them all. This could not have been by oversight. Similarly, Azad's total blacking out of all the important circumstances of the life of Shaikh Muhammad Isma'il, Zauq's only son, cannot have been by oversight. Isma'il was an officer of Bahadur Shah's court, with the title of "Vaqar ud-Daulah" (Honour of the Realm). He was a poet of some note, with Fauq (chosen to rhyme with Zauq) asghis takhallus. In the aftennath of 1857 his wife and children fled Delhi to save their lives, butpoor Isma'il Fauiq was captured and put to death by the British ('Alvi 1992:40-1). Sharafud-Din, oneof Fauq's sons, may actually havebeen living in or near Lahore when Azad wrote Ab-e Hayat. Azad's silence46 about these matters can have only one explanation: he wanted to physically distance himself from Zauq. He didn't want to risk annoying the British by having them know that his beloved mentor's son too was a mortal offender against them. By declaring that classical poetry was dead, Azad got himself out of the awkwardness of having to write about Zauq's successors, biological or spiritual. Despite so much care and foresight, Azad couldn't escape the final irony of time. It was his evaluation of Zauq, and Zauq alone, that failed to convince future gen- erations. The modem Urdu establishment fast reduced Zauq to the size of a mere court sycophant-which he never was. And a poor sycophant he was declared to be-to spend his creative energies in praising Bahadur Shah, whose status was perceived to be less than that of a chess king. Zauq, andhis brilliant prototype Shaikh Imam Bakhsh Nasikh (1776-1838), and Shah Nasir (d. 1838), were all accused of the very things that Azad had taken so much pains to condemn: unrealism, imaginative exuberance, excessive fondness for abstraction, too much concem for verbal artifice, lack of lyricism. In Zauq's case, it was almost a rebound: Azad had praised him too highly-and unconvincingly-and had played down his debt to Nasikh and Shah Nasir. About Nasikh in particular Azad had said ambivalent things, often tilting toward blame. In due course, Azad's specific or latent uncomplimentariness toward Nasikh had its impact, and Nasikh became a dirty word in Urdu ghazal. If Azad had given Nasikh his due, and had praised Zauq in less colourful, extravagant ways, he would have done the right thing by both. Azad, who established or marginalised so many reputations, ended up a victim of his own brilliance, losing for his own ustad the high reputation that he deserved.</page><page sequence="23">92 SOCIAL SCIENTIST BIBLIOGRAPHY AbdulbafI, Balyivi. 1950.

For bref but authentic glimpses of Azid's life and career, see Pnitchett 1994:11-50 passim. 2. Firstpublished 1928, and stillinprint-presumably because it is a strong favourite with college professors. No date for the action is mentioned, but since the novel is autobiographical, the action may be presumed to take place toward the end of the nineteenth century. Mirza Rusva lived from 1857 to 1931. 3. Azidmade both claims inAb-eIfayat (1880) and alsoinhis edition of Zauq's poems (ca. 1890); he created a whole edifice of graphic anecdotes about Zauq and his own interactions with him. The influence of these stories persists, though hostile critics, most notably Shin LIA Kal 'Abid PeshivarI, dispute many of them ('Abid Peshivari 1987). There is howeverno doubt that both Azid and his father knew Zauq very well. 4. Azid has immortalised the episode in Ab-e Hayat (1880). Pritchett has translated it (Pritchett 1994:25). Azid reproduced the passage (and many more) from his account of Zauq in his own edition of Zauq's poems too (Azid 1933:27). 5. Brij Mohan Datttraya Kaifi, who knew Azid personally, wrote in his obituasy on Azid that the Punjab gave shelter to ihe refugees of 1857 just as Lucknow had provided ahome to those whom Nadir Shah's invasion had made homeless in 1739. See Sahil Ahmad 1985:14. 6. Originally published as Hill's preface to his collection of poems, it soon acquired a life of its own that is still, a hundred years later, nowhere near exhaustion. Pritchett provides a fine analysis of both Azid and Hall (Pritchett 1994). Also of interest is the summary and analysis of the Muqaddamah by Laurel Steele (Steele 1981). 7. Azid 1880; the woikwas soonfollowedby a somewhat revised version in 1883 and 1887. The edition of 1907, reissued by the Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy in facsimile in 1982, may be considered definitive. The book has, of course, always been in print. 8. In addition to the magisterial two-volume biography by Aslam FamrIul (1965), long out of print and currently being reprinted with additions, we have amateurish psychological studies</page><page sequence="25">94 SOCIAL SCIENTIST by Vazir Agh&amp; (1968) and by Tabassum Kashmiri ('985). In English, we have Muhammad Sadiq (1974). 9. Abu Dib says that Ibn Qutaibah wrote the Introduction to this work "with the explicit aim of refuting the conventional view which judged poetry purely on the basis of the period in which its authorlived." One of thepoints made by Ibn Qutaibah inthis context was thatpoetry "should be judged according to intrinsic qualities and criteria, not by chronological standards." 10. A telling example is that of poetry attributed to Sardas. Varying accounts claim that Stirdas was a poet at Akbar's court, or a temple poet, or both at once, or at different times, or a composite of two different individuals altogether. Kenneth Bryant solves this problem by simply stipulating a "Stir tradition"; when he says 'Suir," he means the tradition (see Bryant 1978:vii- x). 11. Composed in 887% just after the death of Ibn Qutaibah (883). 12. An excellent discussion of 'Abd ul-Qihir Jurjani (d. 1078/108 1) is to be found in Kamal Abu Dib, 1979. Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych quite properly identifies the pre-Islamic qalidah and the Qur'in as "the twin foundations of Arab-Islamic literary culture." She goes on to say that just as the Qur'inic text was held to be inimitable, the poetry "was considered to be of a quality unattainable by the poets of the Islamic period" (Stetkevychl993:xi). hlie ideal, in the Indo- Muslim literaryculture, however, was toapproximate tothe conditionof miracle. Ghalib (1797- 1869). one of the greatest Urdu poets, wrote thus to his friend Nabi Bakhs Haqir about one of his own ghazals that he liked very much: "Be just, and say: if Urdu were to attain the level of magic or nmiracle, would it have the fonm of this poerm, or some other form?" (KhalTq Anjum 1987:1098; translation mine). Even today, one of the mrore common words of praise for poems recited at literary gatherings in the Urdu milieu is "miracle." 13. EvenAlt.af HusainHill (1837-1914), who, withAz&amp;d, was the othergreatmodemiserinUrdu, quotes such statements with approval in his Muqaddamah_(see for example Hasan Khan 1969:145-56). Incidentally, the concept that no poetry is really new is not an "aberration" merely of the Arabs or the Indo-Muslims. Sanskrit literary theory recognises it fully. Mukund Lath has an interesting discussion on this point in his paper "Creation and Creative Imagination." Lath says that one school of Sanskrit literary theory recognises that poems are made from other poems: "These critics argued that the purpose of poetry was to express universals of experience (in Sanskrit, anubhJvy&amp;nubhavasamJnyam). Such universals were finite in number and common to all men at all times, past or present. And, as such, they had already been expressed by earlier poets, leaving nothiing for modem poets to say" (Lath 1984:18). One here recalls a saying famnous among the Arabs: "Those who went before left nothing for those who came after." 14. Kamal, or perfection, is a word commonly used in the Indo-Muslim milieu to praise artistic excellence. Though now a merely conventional expression, it meant much more in the traditional society. Citing Titus Burckhardt in his introduction to 'Aks-e bihift (a photographic account of Vazir Khan' s Mosque in Lahore), Siraj Munir says that there were two aspects to aitistic achievement in Islam: Wisdom, which takes the artist (through rapture orreflection) to the principle of the Universe, and Skill, which permits organised expression of the Wisdom. Balance between the two produces "perfection" (kamal). See Sir&amp;j Munir 1985. 15. "Wa hum la yash'uran," that is, "They have no awareness"; "wq hum la ya'lamtin," that is, "They donotknow."InArabic, the word forpoetry, shi'r, is from the rootssha 'ara, whichmeans, "toknow, tobe sensible of [something]."FazlurRahman says thatthe rootwordis shu'ar, which means "consciousness orawareness beyondtheordinary"(Rahman 1980:93).Mi4bh ul-lughat one of the more reliable Arabic-Urdu dictionaries, edited by 'AbdulhafIz Balyavi (1950), confirms that sha'ara and shutir are root words with the same meaning. Khusrau takes advantage of the common root and claims, plausibly enough, that since yash'urun means the same as ya'lamuin, poetry (shi'r) and knowledge ('ilm) are viltually the same. 16. Imirm Buk.hari records only the first part of this Tradition. Imirn Ahmad ibn Hanbal records this Tradition in full, though withoutthe intensifier lam that occurs before both hikmatand sihr in the version used here by Khusrau (Ibn Hanbal, n.d.:I, 309). l mn thankful to my friend Dr.</page><page sequence="26">CONSTRUCTING A LITERARY HISTORY, A CANON AND A THEORY 95 Z. A. SiddIqi of Banaras Hindu University for this information. 17. Sidrah is a lotus-like tree in Paradise; tUbais a fruit-bearing tree in Paradise. 18. The nightingale of the garden of ma za7gh signifies the Prophet Muhammad. It is a beautiful pun involving a Qur'anic phrase (53:17) about the Prophet: "His sight never swerved / Nor did it go wrong" (trans. by Ali,1983). Since this verse is God's praise for the Prophet, Khusrau imagines the whole verse (signalled by the first two words, mJ zagh), as a garden of which Muhammad is the nightingale. Since in Persian ma means "we, us" and zagh means "crow," and there are many tree metaphors in the text, the pun becomes extremely complex and delightful. 19. Here I give my literal translation of Khusrau's Persian rendering of the verse (11:269) quoted by him earlier in Arabic. 20. There is athought-provokingpaperby Qaz.i Jamal HIusain called "Dibachahe Ghurrat ul-kanil ki ma'naviyat" (Jamal Husain 1993). The preface to Ghurrat ul-kamal has been printed (very badly) only once, from Delhi, by Kutbkhinah-e Ni?amiyah (n.d.). The manuscript in the Habib Ganj collection of Aligarh Muslim University is much better. 21. Of special interest for our purposes are Books II and X. In Book X, the merits and defects of poetry are analysed in language reminiscent of legal examination. Phrases like "defenders of poetry" and "defence" occur frequently. For extensive and easily accessible extracts from Jowett's translation, see Adams 1971. 22. This is my free translation of a sentence in the Urdu version of extracts from JurjanI's Asrar ul-balaghat prepared for me by Dr. Z. A. Siddiqi. 23. "Ahsan ush-shi'ri akiabuhu" in Arabic. What I have given in the text is Bonnebaker's translation (1956:1). Shakespeare seems to be translating Qudamah unconsciously: "For the truest poetiy is the most feigning" (As YouLike t III, 3, 19-20). Jurjani's comment in Asrar is worth quoting here: "The other ones who say that the biggest liar of a poet is the best poet hold the opinion that the art [of poetry] can prosper and find its greatest glamour and develop to many-sidedness only where it can operate freely and with a maximum of elbow room.... Unceasingly, the motifs stream toward him; he draws water from a well that will never run dry, takes out things from a container that is forever full" (Broms 1972:26-7). 24. The terms used in the text cited are "informative" for khabariyah and "performative" for insha'iyah. However, Iprefer"falsifiable" and "non-falsifiable" because the insW iyahis actually a little more than performative. Subjunctive statements ("Oh, to be in England / Now that April's there") and rhetorical interrogatives ("Do I live, am I dead?") are also insha iyah. (The first example is from Browning's "Home Thoughts, From Abroad," and the second from his "The Bishop Orders his Tomb at St. Praxed's Church.") 25. 'Abdul-Q&amp;dirBadayimi says thatMiftJh ul-V'Ulum and its commentaries were taughtin Indian Islamic schools from the time of Sikandar Lodi (r. 1489-15 10). "Among the great and learned men of the time of Sultan Sikandar were Shaikh 'Abdullah T.ulumbi and Shaikh 'Azizullah Thlumbi, both of whom.. . introduced the systematic study of intellectual sciences into that country [of Hindustan]. One of his 1= Shaikh 'Azizullah'sJ pupils was Miyan Hatim Sanbali, who is commonly said to have read the commentary on theMiMftd. more than thirty times in the course of his life, and the Mutavval more than forty times." See Badayuni 1976:1,427-8. The phrase "commentary ontheMiftah"is italicisedinRanking's translation, as if it were the name of a book. Actually, it should have beenunitalicised and have read, "the two commentaries on the Miftah," because the Persian text has "sharhain" (that is, two commentaries). Apparently there were two well-known commentaries on this work that were popularly studied a; that time, in addition to the Mutavval of Taftazani (1322-90). The Mutavval is an extremely long commentary on Part III of the Miftah; it deals with rhetoric and figures of speech. About the above-mentioned Shaikh Hatim Bad&amp;yini says, "It used to be said that he had, in the course of his teaching, gone through the conrnentary on theMifta.h and theMutavval.. .nearly forty times." See Badayun! 1978:11I, 109.

Tabitab&amp;'i 's commentasy on Ghlib was first published in 1900, and is still in print. TabitabaV' knew more Arabic and Persian literature and theory than Hal, but he suffered the same fate as HalO: those of their ideas that were perceived as westem-derived (like Tabit.aba'I 's dislike of wordplay) gained immense prestige and currency; other ideas of theirs that were more clearly based on traditional poetics went unnoticed. 27. Bonnebaker says that his Arab friend who first quoted to him Qudamah's dictum about the best poetry being the most given to lies, rejected this definition vehemently, and his emphatic rejection "was expressed with a force which a European would only use if he were opposing a contemporary scholar" (Bonnebaker 1956:1). Bonnebaker should have appreciated the fact that his Arab friend was only repudiating his own past, as he had been taught to do. 28. The whole of this and the following extract have also been quoted approvingly by Mas'urd Hasan Riivi Adib, who has the reputation of being a defender of classical Urdu poetry against Hal. What greater evidence could there be of the harm caused by the "westemisation" of Azad and Hill? See Riivi 1953:15-16. 29. This subtitle appears in all editions; translation mine. 30.

Also, Vall (1667-1720/25) was not strictly a Gujrati; his father, oran even earlierforbear, apparently moved from Gujarat to the Deccan, where Vall seems to have been born. See Jamil Jilibi 1977:422-23, 533-34. 34. An authoritative source forthe Q&amp;'im shi'r is Iqtida Hasan 1965:215. I translate the Urdu word lachar as "feeble," which is what it meant until the nineteenth century. In modem Urdu, it has a much stronger effect, something like, "absurd, stupid." The shi'r is immensely popular with academic Urdu critics-who follow Azad almost blindly-and I can testify to its universal acceptance as accurate among the young Urdu speakers of my time. 35. The translation is mine. The text quoted here is slightly different from Rizvi Adib's version, but the meaning is clear. The point is that according to Agh&amp;, 7ahur (d. 1617), a well-known Persian poet of the "Indian Style," created a style of his own in Persian poetry, and Vall was the creatorof anew style in Urdupoetry-not, of course, anew language differentfrom Dakani. 36. He ignored even Qa'im, literally marginalising him by relegating him to a footnote [190] and the casual reference [98] quoted above. On page 98, Q&amp;'im is described as "a contemporary" of Mir's. Onpage 190, he ismentioned as the original subject of a satire bySauda (1713-1781). There is then a brief footnote saying, inter alia, that his collection of poems cannot at all be ranked below those of Mir or Saud&amp;-"'but popular acclaim is something else again; he didn't become famous." The fact of the matter is that before Ab-e Hayat Qa'im was universally re- garded as a major poet; Ghalib greatly admired him, and called him ustr&amp;d [master]. Qa'im's star sanklow the dayAb-eljayat was published. IttookQa'im's reputationnearly seventy-five years to recover. The only poet from Bihar or Bengal whom Azad mentions is Rasikh 'Az1mbidbdI (1748-1822). He gets four lines on page 207. Even in this small space, Azad slips inthe remark, "everyone fromthat [eastem] sideheldhimtobeanust.d."Thatis,Azidhimself is unable, or unwilling, to grant Risikh that status. The fact is that Rasikh is a major poet, but Azad's marginalisation of him ensured that even today, his reputation outside Bihar is very slight. Azid does briefly mention the prose writers of the College of Fort William in Calcutta [36-37]. But that is something different-the idea is to praise the sagacity of the English. And anyway, Azid wasn't writing a history of Urdu prose. 37. It should benoted thatinAzAd's time there were atleastthree extant tazkirahs devoted to women poets of Urdu.

For further infonmation see Farman Fatihpuri 1964. The circum- stances of Gunna Begam's death are narrated by Sa'adatYarKhan Rangin inKhush ma'rikah- e zebJ (1846), edited by Shamlm Inhonvi, p. 710. On Sharafn, see BadayUnl 1883:32. 38. "India" here means Northem India. In medieval geography, only the area north of the river Narmada was considered "Hind." 39. "Rekhtah" means, among otherthings, "mixed." Urdu was often called Rekhtah in Delhi, from the eighteenth century onwards. Until about the third quarter of the nineteenth century, rekhtah also meant "a poem in the language called rekhtah." Rekhtah was also a style of Urdu poetry; in this style, current till about the end of the seventeenth century, Urdu and Persian were freely mixed. 40. Farnan FatibhpG (1964:295) says that Safa Badayuinl, in his Shamfm-e sukhan h i.yah-e avval (1872), expounded the same theory about the origin of Urdu as Azad did in Ab-e hayat, and regrets that Azad did not acknowledge or even mention Safa Badayuni. But it seems to me that the view about Braj Bhasha being the mother of Urdu was quite co.mmonly held in those days, and Azad didn't regard it as anyone's property. 41. The word here, mubtazal, "everyday" in its original Arabic sense, had also acquired by Azad's time the meaning of "contemptible, base, degenerate." Platts gives these meanings in his dictionary (1884). Since in modem Urdu the original Arabic sense is almost entirely lost, most readers would now interpret Azad' s words here in the pejorative sense. 42. Fancy medieval mirrors were mounted on large pictures, orpictures werepainted around them. 43. Azad uses the loaded word pak, which means "undefiled, pure, chaste." 44. Governor General of India, 1828-35. "To pay for a pontoon bridge over the Yamuna at Agra- costing more than the forbidden Rs. 1 0,000-he sold off some marble lumber from a ruinous bath inAgra Fort, and had the Great Gun of Agra (a Mughal weapon reputed to have once fired a shot to Fatehpur Sikri 24 miles away) melted down: this started a long-lived canard that he had wanted to sell off the Taj Mahal." The Great Gun was, however, so sturdy and of such dense material that "it had to be blown up before it could be melted down." See Rosselli 1974:283. I am indebted to Dr. Shushil Srivastava of Allahabad University for brnging this book to my notice. 45. Also, both were exclusively marRiyah poets. A mar?iyah is a longishpoem lamenting the death, in battle, of Husain, the Prophet's grandson. Azad was a Shi'a; Shi'a are the sect among Muslims who ritualise the lament for Husain. Double symbolism, perhaps, in choosing these two poets with whom to terminate the tale? 46. They were: Amir Mina'i (1828-1900), pupil of Asar, who himself was a disciple of Mushafi; Anvar DihlavI (1847/8-85), disciple of Zauq, then of Ghalib; Dagh (1831-1905), disciple of Zauq; Hali (1837-1914), disciple of Ghalib; Z amin 'All Jalal (1834-1909), disciple of Rashk, who himself was a disciple of Nasikh; KhurshId 'All Nafis (1819-1901), son and disciple of Anis; and Zahir DihlavI (1 825-191 1), disciple of Zauq. This list, though compiled by me from personalknowledge of the eminence ofthe sevenpoets mentionedhere, isnotadhominem. Anvar, Nafis, and Zahir are somewhat in the shadow at present, but Amir, Jalal, Dagh, and Hall are still quite prominent. Hall, of course, has his prmary place as a modemist and reformer. But his position as a classical poet also is quite secure. 47. Azad mentions Shaikh Muhammad Isma'il's death quite casually, giving no hint of the circumstances. In the context of Isma'il's and his joint efforts to put together a complete collection of Zauq' s poems, he says only thatthe ghadr-thatis, sedition ortreason, aterm used by the English, and by "loyal" or cautions Indians-suddenly broke out: "No one was any longer mindful of anyone else. It is a matter of regret that along with his biological offspring Khallfah Muhammad Isma'fl, his spiritual offspring [of poetry] also departed this world" [554].</page></plain_text>
