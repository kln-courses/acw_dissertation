<plain_text><page sequence="1">Can man communicate with other animals? Is language not unique to humans? Ifso, is mankinds position in nature s hierarchy challenged? Donald R. G riffin attacks these and other questions in his revised and enlarged edition of The Ouestion of AnimalAwareness Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Experience Dr. Griffin, a professor at The Rockefeller University and an inter- nationally recognized authority on animal behavior and physiology, renews and expands his attack on the long-held thesis that animals do not have mental experiences. In doing so, he marshals new evi? dence to support the hypothesis that a true science of cognitive etho- logy could be developed if investigators would shed their fears of anthropomorphism. Linguists, ethologists, behaviorists, philosophers, anthropolo- gists, and laymen interested in the world around them will be fascin- ated (and perhaps enraged) by Dr. Griffin's controversial arguments. 220 pp., bibliography, indexes Hardcover: ISBN 87470-035-3 $13.95 plus $3.00postage and handling ($3.50 foreign) For your copy, write: The Rockefeller University Press Dept.

PUBLISHER $** THE ANATOMY OF THE GRASSHOPPER (Romalea microptera) By Jack Colvard Jones, Univ. of Maryland, College Park. This lucid textbook on and laboratory guide to the anatomy of the grasshopper contains more than 150 well-labeled illustrations. The author depicts with unparalleled precision the intricate anatomy of this most commonly dissected of insects. In addition to classification and description, the introduction offers methods for examining, dissecting, and sketching the anatomical parts. The author then analyzes the external anatomy as follows: ? head and neck - head capsule, appendages of the head, mouthparts, and neck ? thorax and its appendages - prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax ? abdomen - pregenital segments, terminal uromeres, and male and female genitalia and associated structures In the second segment, he examines the internal anatomy, including: ? endoskeleton - head, thorax, and abdomen ? muscles - head, thorax, and abdomen ? digestive system - alimentary canal and Malpighian tubules ? tracheal and circulatory systems ? nervous and endocrine systems - central and visceral nervous systems and adult endocrine glands ? male and female reproductive systems Students of biology, comparative anatomy, general entomology, and insect morphology wanting a thorough guide to the study of the grasshopper will find this manual indispensable.
