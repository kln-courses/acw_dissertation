With Marlowe the case is different. Marlowe has from the start failed to inspire trust. He "was intemperate &amp; of cruel hart," according to his roommate, Kyd; and in various ways the idea persists that his defects of character or quirks of psychology account for the difficulties we have with him. Marlowe is blamed for our critical perplexity; our difficulties are laid to the charge of his supposedly uncertain control over or self-divided perception of his material. Especially in the matter of Marlowe's relation to the "opinions" of his time - the notorious Eliza- bethan World-Picture - Marlowe's "damnable" inaccessibility to inter- rogation, by Privy Council or critic, may seem positively scandalous.1 Without quite assuming that Marlowe never made an artistic miscal- culation, I want here to suppose that basically Marlowe did know what he was doing, and that the problems we encounter are often part of his artistic method. I want to suppose that Marlowe did understand his own ideas and feelings - as much as that is ever possible - and that the major plays are not the gropings of a neurotic rebel. These suppositions should not lead to any diminution of Marlowe's stature as an explorer of the tensions, heterodoxies, and tragic possibilities in the ethos he dramatized.2 For clear-sighted is not simple-minded: it was not Marlowe but his 1.

The fact that Faustus asks is significant: it is something Marlowe's heroes often do. (In this essay I will be concerned only with Barabas, T amburlaine, and Faustus.) The questions they ask, and the ways they ask them, are worth attending to for a variety of reasons. We should attend because, oddly, Marlowe's questioners themselves tend not to; frequently they will not pause for an answer. And this peculiarity may lead us to consider the problematic relationships - dramatic, philosophical, emotion- al - between Marlowe and his characters, and between those characters and us. Also it is worth attending to the Marlovian questions because they are too easily drowned out by another characteristic rhetorical device, the hyperboles so well analyzed by Harry Levin.3 The interrogative mood would not, perhaps, seem to sort well with the assertive declarations of the Overreacher. But Puttenham (among others) distinguishes a variety of rhetorical questions whose effects are potentially various and surprising. There is, for instance, erotema or "The Questioner": "a kinde of figurative speach when we aske many ques- tions and looke for none answere, speaking indeed by interrogation, which we might as well say by affirmation. "4 Erotema is as tricky a figure as hyperbole. With the latter, which Puttenham also calls "the loud Iyer," there is the risk of over-taxing the audience's credulity. So, too, with erotema : the questioner who wants to affirm had better be sure that his question will get the intended response. Puttenham gives as an example of erotema , " Medea excusing her great crueltie vsed in the murder of her owne children which she had by Iason. . . : " Was I able to make them I praie you tell, /Andami not able to marre them all aswell? " For an uncomfort- able instant the question admits answers beyond the scope of the obviously intended one. And to the extent that it does, it makes the audience active rather than passive: Medea's question forces us to realize, as though we were discovering it ourselves, the horror in this ostensible propriety of the maker marring her creatures. In Marlowe's characters' mouths, too, "the questioner" may allow an audience to hear something quite different, in dramatic effect, than what would be said "by affirmation." 3.

(145-47)5 I begin with The Jew of Malta because the relationships it establishes between author and character and between character and audience are typically Marlovian but more easily discerned than in the other plays, partly because of its more overtly satirical stance. In Barabas' question the antithesis heaven-earthly is explicit (in Tamburlaine it is strikingly implicit); and the antithesis makes it possible to find other plausible answers to complement Barabas' intended one. The questioner invites us to take a wicked delight in his reduction of all values to the "earthly" measure - a pleasure it would be hard to refuse. But one would have to redefine radically the conventional meanings of "heaven" and "earthly" in order to give full assent to Barabas' affirmative. Marlowe's rhetorical and philosophical control is evident in his manipulation of this semantic fact. He pulls us shockingly toward a reductive redefinition of his terms, at the same time that he makes ironic profit out of the impossibility of immediately effecting that redefinition. Our attitude toward Barabas is complex: we are with him in knowing more about the ways of the world than the "haplesse man" of conscience who "for his conscience Hues in beggery" (158); but we are also with the author who knows that the inescapable traditional values of "heaven" will leave Barabas' "earthly man" absurdly self-defeated. Marlowe has been establishing an uneasily conflicting relationship between the audience and Barabas from the start, where his long soliloquy gives ample opportunity for both complicity and distance.6 It begins in wish-fulfillment, with Barabas literally mounding up his very disposable assets: "So that of thus much that returne was made: / And of 5 .

Havelock Ellis, in his Mermaid edition (London, 1893), was the first modern roundly to declare of Marlowe that "He is his own hero" (xxxiv).

But the pleasure of playing with money is short-lived; Barabas pauses, tired and disgusted with his labors: "Fye; what a trouble tis to count this trash" (42). The belief that worldly wealth is heaven's trash is part of the pious baggage the Elizabethan theatergoer inevitably brings with him to this odd Malta. But Marlowe allows the orthodox reminder to obtrude only an instant, as Barabas goes on to protest against the intolerable coarseness of his own proceedings - not, however, by the "heavenly" but precisely by the "earthly" measure. First we are abashed, then again delighted as Barabas introduces us to the less vulgar ways of being earthly rich. But then, again, we're caught: in what follows, the vision of this finer way begins by disarming us, then again alarming us, as we hear, ironically undercutting Barabas, the tones of that value-system which will be made explicit in the "heaven-earthly" antithesis: Giue me the Merchants of the Indian Mynes, That trade in mettali of the purest mould; The wealthy Moore, that in the Easteme rockes Without controule can picke his riches vp, And in his house heape pearle like pibble-stones; Receiue them free, and sell them by the weight, Bags of fiery Opals, Saphires, Amatists, lacints, hard Topas, grasse-greene Emeraulds, Beauteous Rubyes, sparkling Diamonds, And seildsene costly stones of so great price, As one of them indifferently rated, And of a Carrect of this quantity, May serue in perill of calamity To ransome great Kings from captiuity. This is the ware wherein consists my wealth. (54-67) Will not some in the audience remember, in this talk of "costly stones of so great price," a merchant who sold all he had to purchase one pearl of great price? What really, "in perill of calamity," has served "To ransome great Kings from captiuity"?7 Barabas' speech is ingeniously hyperbolic as it searches for ever-smaller ways of enclosing wealth. And it shows the affinity between hyperbole and erotema : overreaching him- self, Barabas stumbles into the language of transcendence; and once we hear that language it is difficult not to feel some distance between 7.

Hunter, "The Theology of The Jew of Malta, " Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 27 (1964), 211-40.</page><page sequence="5">Lawrence Danson 1 ourselves and the speaker. That distance is the sort we feel when a rhetorical question provokes an unexpected response. This first soliloquy, then, begins to establish the play's ironic attitude toward Barabas and his wealth, and to place us in our interestingly active position between enjoyment of Barabas' wit and the recognition of a range of spiritual meanings beyond his conceiving. Now he is interrupted by his merchants bringing news. The pace (84-140) is brisk; there is no opportunity for reflection; we are caught up in the excitement of getting and spending until, alone again, Barabas resumes the work of his first speech: Thus tro wies our fortune in by land and Sea, And thus are wee on euery side inrich'd: These are the Blessings promis'd to the Iewes, And herein was old Abrams happinesse: What more may Heaven doe for earthly man Then thus to powre out plenty in their laps? (141-46) The identification of the Jews' promised blessings with earthly riches is the kind of iconoclastic wit with which Marlowe shocked Richard Baines. Here, it is functional in establishing the ironic limits of the Maltese universe, in which "Euery ones price is written on his backe" (764). But Barabas has introduced a leaky allusion which, like the open-ended erotema, allows the audience to take an active part, hearing both what the character intends and something more. Marlowe allows his audience to go outside Malta's slavish perspective: it would have taken no special exegetical skill to know that, in the contemporary understanding, the family treasure of "old Abrams happinesse" was Christ and that the promised blessing was a spiritual one.8 Barabas is comically outrageous in his richly carnal mistaking of the Bible's promise. The game is not simply that of one-upping Barabas with our privi- leged knowledge. The two rhetorical questions that immediately follow Barabas' first slippery one - "Who hateth me but for my happinesse? / Or who is honour 'd now but for his wealth? " (150-51 ) - show Barabas in his dual role, as much the satirist as the object of satire. The lesson Barabas takes from these questions is, within the Maltese scheme of things, amply justified by the Christian characters: Rather had I a lew be hated thus, Then pittied in a Christian pouerty: 8. See Hunter, "Theology, " 216-17, who cites Gal. 3.3-16.</page><page sequence="6">8 English Literary Renaissance For I can see no fruits in all their faith But malice, falshood, and excessiue pride, Which me thinkes fits not their profession. (152-56) The concluding line is deliriously understated. What less fits a Christian profession than the rotten fruits Barabas sees? And who can doubt that the Christians of Malta are reaping a rich crop of them? (In fact, to take up my own rhetorical question, I suspect that many in Marlowe's audience might fail to hear this satire against Christian hypocrisy - which is why it would have been supererogatory for a savagely indignant Marlowe to have written, in Elizabethan England, a satire against Jews.)9 " W e doo aske oftentymes, because we would know: we do aske also, because we woulde chide, and sette fur the our grief with more vehe- mencie, the one is called Interrogate, the other is called Percontatio. " 10 Thus, in a percontatio , Barabas asks the Christian governor, Ferneze: "Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?" (290). And thus a Christian knight in reply: "Haue strangers leaue with vs to get their wealth?" (291). Thomas Wilson's nickname for percontatio is "snappishe askying"; in this exchange between Barabas and the governor's man we see the snappish asker out-snapped. It is a model for the relationship between Barabas and Ferneze throughout the play. Marlowe's relationship with Barabas is oblique, as is Barabas' with us. Ferneze 's relationships - with author, audience, and the entire cast of characters - are more nearly opaque. With Barabas we must be on guard both because he takes us into his confidence, thus making us complicit in his Machiavellian game, and also because he reserves the right to trick us, his accomplices. Ferneze is another confidence man, but unlike Barabas he never acknowledges the con. Macheuil warns us in his Prologue: Admir'd I am of those that hate me most. Though some speake openly against my bookes, Yet will they reade me, and thereby attaine To Peters Chayre. (9-12) 9. Alfred Harbage, noting the anti-Semitism of many Elizabethans, assumes that Marlowe was not only a man of his times but a complacent follower of them; hence he denies any satire against misprofessing Christians. ("Innocent Barabas, " Tulane Drama Review , 8 [1964], 47-58.) I touch on the relations - more complex, I think, than Harbage allows - among theology, preju- dice, and art in The Harmonies of The Merchant of Venice (New Haven, 1978). 10. Thomas Wilson, The Arte of Rhetorique (1553), Sig. Bb2.</page><page sequence="7">Lawrence Danson 9 Only a covert Macheuil is a consistent Macheuil. Ferneze, who keeps his counsel, by the end keeps all: Barabas' wealth, the Turkish tribute, the slave trade, Malta. The obliquity of Marlowe's presentation of Ferneze makes him worth a moment's study, before we go on to more Marlovian questioners. This Christian champion enters on a question: "Now Bassoes, what demand you at our hands?" Again: "What's Cyprus , Candy , and those other lies / To vs, or Malta?" (230, 234-35). Is this asking or chiding, interrogado or percontatio ? In fact Ferneze knows perfectly well what the Turk wants, but his moment of deceptive rhetoric helps us, by putting us on our guard. W e should know now how to react to Ferneze in the game of question-and-answer he plays with Barabas. For instance Barabas snappishly asks if the Jews must be taxed "equally" with the Christians, and Ferneze replies: No, lew, like infidels. For through our sufferance of your hatefull liues, Who stand accursed in the sight of heauen, These taxes and afflictions are befalne, And therefore thus we are determined. (294-98) Does Ferneze believe that his "sufferance" of the Jews has caused the Turkish affliction? Does Marlowe expect us to believe that Ferneze believes it? Marlowe's satire, like Ferneze 's gamesmanship, is consum- mate. Again Barabas tries a snappish question: "Will you then steale my goods? / Is theft the ground of your Religion?" (327-28); and again Ferneze has the reply pious: No, lew, we take particularly thine To saue the ruine of a multitude: And better one want for a common good, Then many perish for a priuate man. (329-32) This is (as Boas points out in his edition) essentially "the plea of Caiaphas" (John 11.50). The overly-revealing allusion, perfectly con- trolled and slyly understated, is as typically Marlovian as any splendid hyperbole. Barabas' struggle to keep from being preached out of his possessions continues in the interrogative mood and theological vein: Some Iewes are wicked, as all Christians are: But say the T ribe that I descended of Were all in generali cast away for sinne,</page><page sequence="8">10 English Literary Renaissance Shall I be tryed by their transgression? The man that dealeth righteously shall liue: And which of you can charge me otherwise? (345-50) A question not to be asked, that last. Ferneze 's reply begins in righteous indignation and ends in transparent twaddle: Out, wretched Barabas, Sham'st thou not thus to iustifie thy selfe As if we knew not thy profession? If thou rely vpon thy righteousness, Be patient and thy riches will increase. Excesse of wealth is cause of covetousnesse: And couetousnesse, oh 'tis a monstrous sinne. (351-57) Ferneze 's last line, with its portentous polysyllables surrounding the vacuous ejaculation, is as close as he comes to showing any pleasure in his own Machiavellianism. "Policy," Barabas concludes, playing on some Maltese key- words, "that's their profession" (393). As the play turns more broadly comic after the initial scenes its satire against misprofessing Christians becomes unmistakeable. We are in no doubt, for instance, about Marlowe's attitude toward the "religious caterpillars" who lament that Abigail, dying a Christian, dies "a Virgin too, that grieues me most" (1497), and whose attempts to bring Barabas to repentance end in a fratricidal struggle for his fortune. But what does the play say about the "profes- sion" itself, apart from its woefully inadequate professors? The Jew of Malta is more concerned with moral values than with specifically theological; the question of Marlowe's attitude toward Christianity in it can therefore be answered only in part. We can know that Barabas is wicked and, more significantly, that Ferneze is too because we tacitly recognize the play's coherent moral view. We can answer its sly rhetorical questions and understand the range of its ironic allusions because we know not only what the characters know, but also what Marlowe knows. That moral view and that knowledge are no less consistent with a Christian profession than is satire against nominally Christian hypocrites. Never has Te deum rung more hollowly than in Ferneze 's concluding couplet, "So march away, and let due praise be giuen / Neither to Fate nor Fortune, but to Heauen" (2409-10). If we cannot be sure in this play that Marlowe himself gives praise to heaven, we can be sure of his ironic distance from the obdurate Machiavellian who mouths the praise.</page><page sequence="9">Lawrence Danson 11 II The situation is more complicated in Tamburlaine. And surely we will mistake it if we assume that the Scythian shepherd is really only the Cantabrigian Marlowe in fancy-dress. Yet such an identification is frequently made, with the result that either Marlowe or his play is impugned. In his own day, Greene implied that Marlowe would dare "God out of heaven with that atheist T amburlaine" ; more recently, J. B. Steane continues the tradition of ad hominem criticism: "It is clear that, whether in pleasure or repulsion, Marlowe was attracted to cruelty; and here in Tamburlaine , although the mind is divided, the division is unequal and the larger part seems to rate violence and cruelty as among the enviable excitements of life. "n Examining "The Strange Case of Chris- topher Marlowe," L. C. Knights takes Tamburlaine 's "regressive crav- ing for effortless and unlimited power" as a symptom of Marlowe's own parlous state; and Wilbur Sanders detects in the play "a bad breath of psychic decay."12 Steane condemns the play's "Fascist spirit"; before him, Willard Farnham, less outraged but similarly identifying author with character, had written that Marlowe "gave himself completely to a drama of untrammeled worldly success. "13 That these opinions do not fit all the evidence is noticed by the critics, who therefore either posit an extraordinarily sudden change of heart - "Needless to say, Marlowe outgrew this young man's worship of pomp, or he could not afterward have written the tragedies that he did write"14 - or a divided mind. Wilbur Sanders goes further, assuming not a divided but an absent mind: "moral ambiguity" accounts for "the rival interpretations of Tambur- laine , " in which we have "the problem of deciding where precisely Marlowe stands" - and Sanders wonders if "perhaps he stands precisely nowhere."15 But there is a coherent moral vision in Tamburlaine , however indirectly it is made to emerge; it is neither reductively moralistic nor foolishly Promethean. And it is coherent throughout both parts of the drama. The distinction Harry Levin draws obscures this continuity: "By the end of the First Part [T amburlaine] is a candidate for apotheosis. But the Second 11. Steane, p. 85. 12. Knights, p. 86; Sanders, p. 30. 13. Steane, p. 83; Farnham, The Medieval Heritage of Elizabethan 1 rageay (üerkeley, Cal., 1936 J, p. 373. 14.

Sanders, p. 35.</page><page sequence="10">12 English Literary Renaissance reveals the self- proclaimed god as a mortal, a human being whose strength is his inhumanity and whose weakness is his mortality."16 Did we need Part Two to tell us that? Were we ever to believe that T amburlaine held "the Fates bound fast in yron chaînes" or with his hand turned "Fortunes wheel about" (369-70)? Tamburlaine 's "working words" need not work on an audience exactly as they do on his impressionable antagonists.17 Certainly the plays' vision does not depend on any last-second retribution. Tamburlaine 's death by spontaneous combustion may indeed carry, as Roy Battenhouse tells us, the tradi- tional idea that "God is casting His Scourge into the fire" of his own rage.18 But we might as well take its inclusion as a sop to the softer- minded Christians in Marlowe's audience or a joke at their piously expectant expense, for it neither alters nor even necessarily confirms what has come before. The Prologue has bid us "View but his picture in this tragické glasse / And than applaud his fortunes as you please." The astonishing thing is not only that T amburlaine is allowed to make good so many of his threats, but that we really are expected to use our judgment in interpreting the dramatic image - and to applaud that image only as we please. A person who believes himself to be immortal is probably not to be trusted with strenuous philosophizing. From the colorful, if childish, question early in his career, Is it not braue to be a King, Techelles , Vsumcasane and Theridamas? Is it not passing braue to be a King, And ride in triumph through Persepolisł (756-59) - from that erotema , which shows as much a delight in pretty sounds as it does anything else, Tamburlaine passes on to consider man's place in "The wondrous Architecture of the world" (873). The speech, which is in two parts, divided by a significant rhetorical question, has occasioned 16. Levin, p. 50. 17. Masinton, p. 20, and Godshalk, p. 123, comment on the ironic disparity between words and deeds. Cf. J. R. Mulryne and Stephen Fender, "Marlowe and the 'Comic Distance in Christopher Marlowe, ed. Brian Morris (London, 1968), 49-64. But Emrys Jones, Origins, assumes that T amburlaine speaks in Marlowe's own voice: "T amburlaine is never demonstrably wrong in any of his actions; he is never measured against a standard outside himself and found wanting" (pp. 14-15). 18. "Tamburlaine: The Scourge of God," PMLA, 56 (1941), 346; see also his Marlowes Tamburlaine (Nashville, Tenn., 1941).</page><page sequence="11">Lawrence Danson 13 much critical debate. It begins as a kind of apologia addressed to the defeated, weak King Cosroe: The thirst of raigne and sweetnes of a crown, That causde the eldest sonne of heauenly Ops, To thrust his doting father from his chaire, And place himselfe in the Emperiall heauen, Moou'd me to manage armes against thy state. What better president [precedent] than mightie loue? (863-68) Tamburlaine takes a somewhat squalid family quarrel - the picture of Jove throwing his "heavenly" father out of his chair is neither heroic nor pretty - as the model for his project of world conquest. The ironic iteration of the words "heaven" and "heavenly" would make it espe- cially difficult for an alert member of the audience not to compare this example of filial revolt with the Christ-story of love, obedience, and reconciliation. Tillyard's famous terse dictum is worth repeating: "The orthodox scheme of salvation was pervasive in the Elizabethan age. Y ou could revolt against it but you could not ignore it."19 The success of Marlowe's rhetorical and dramaturgical indirectness depends on the impossibility of ignoring it, even when an Oriental despot invokes a Roman deity. The part of T amburlaine's speech following his question has attracted the most critical commentary. What kind of worldview is this? What are we to make of its disturbing conclusion? Nature that fram'd vs of foure Elements, Warring within our breasts for regiment, Doth teach vs all to haue aspyring minds: Our soules, whose faculties can comprehend The wondrous Architecture of the world: And measure euery wandring plannets course, Still climing after knowledge infinite, And alwaies moouing as the restles Spheares, Wils vs to weare our selues and neuer rest, Vntill we reach the ripest fruit of all, That perfect blisse and sole felicitie, The sweet fruition of an earthly crowne. (869-80) Scholars have sought without much success a provenance for this surpris- ing notion that nature, whose essence is supposed to be strife, teaches us to imitate its incessant internecine warfare. In all the putative models, 19. E. M. W. Tillyard, The Elizabethan World Picture (1943; rpt. New York, n. d. ), p. 19.</page><page sequence="12">14 English Literary Renaissance nature's strife actually suggests an ideal of eventual or subsistent har- mony: the absence of such an ideal from Tamburlaine's speech has been taken, therefore, either as evidence of Marlowe's prescient modernity or of his confusion.20 But the assiduity with which we cull the history of ideas may obscure the simple fact that we have here Tamburlaine's ideas, not Plato's, Aristotle's, Empedocles', DuBartas', Tennyson's or Darwin's - not even, dramatically speaking, Marlowe's. What is at issue is neither Marlowe's modernity nor his confusion, but his ironic distance from his character. The precedent Tamburlaine takes from his notion of a "war- ring," self-divided nature is grander sounding but no more convincing than the precedent he draws from the unquiet homelife of the gods. He sees nature disturbed and sets about imitating it, as though one were to draw from the observation of cancer the lesson that men should behave in their moral lives like metastasising cells. The conclusion of the speech most decidedly demands that we distin- guish Marlowe from his speaker. The brilliant periodic sentence swells, carrying us literally towards "Heaven" - by way of the loaded phrases "ripest fruit," "perfect bliss," "sole felicity" - only to drop us rudely on "The sweet fruition of an earthly crown." The techniques are similar to those Marlowe was to use, in a comic vein, in The Jew of Malta. Tamburlaine's earthly bliss is intended to make no more sense than Barabas' "Oh girle, oh gold, oh beauty, oh my blisse" (695). The attempt to press words indelibly associated with a transcendental ideal into the service of worldly aspiration is indeed challenging, and perhaps disturb- ing, but it cannot be wholly successful. Denying us the satisfaction of the word "heavenly," which syntax and semantics lead us powerfully to expect, makes the substituted "earthly" inescapably ironic. You can deny heaven, as Tamburlaine does, but without a willful act of cultural, linguistic amnesia you cannot ignore it. 20. Paul Kocher, Marlowe: A Study (Chapel Hill, N. Carolina, 1946), p. 76, cites Empedocles, Heraclitus, and DuBartas but concludes that the absence of an associated idea of possible harmony makes Tamburlaine's "a new interpretation of phenomena." Una Ellis-Fermor, Chris- topher Marlowe (London, 1927), p. 33, adduces Platonic influence only to reject it in favor of the assertion that Tamburlaine 's "is a tentative, imperfect, original idea . . . startlingly modern, or at least startlingly independent of [Marlowe's] contemporaries." D. J. Palmer cites "a basic doctrine of Aristotelian physics that according to the laws of nature each of the four elements seeks its own place . . . but that in nature the four elements are not finally able to realise this potentiality, but are continually striving to do so." The absence of the harmonious ideal from Tamburlaine's vision is taken by Palmer as evidence of "Marlowe's Naturalism" (in Christopher Marlowe, ed. Brian Morris, pp. 163-65).</page><page sequence="13">Lawrence Danson 15 Harry Levin denies that there is anticlimax in the vision of "an earthly crown": Tamburlaine 's conception of bliss is not less climactic because it is heresy [WJhereas a heavenly crown was the pious hope of every Christian, an earthly crown is the notorious emblem of worldliness, heterodoxy, and pride of life. In short, it is not bathos but blasphemy.21 It sounds better, of course, to be grandly defiant rather than merely stupid, or blasphemous rather than bathetic. But Marlowe makes the distinction hard to maintain: they are different perspectives on the same thing. Part of the play's great originality is its admitting the aggrandizing perspective. This is indeed a different dramatic world from the one in which, for instance, the rebelling Lucifer in the Corpus Christi plays is by necessity a fearful, farting grotesque. But Marlowe's play is also drama- turgically notable for the various indirect ways, including the rhetorical, that it keeps us aware of the possibility of a heavenly crown: and where there is that possibility the striving for an earthly crown must be seen as the perverse choice of a lesser good. Levin calls the Marlovian hero an "overreacher"; it would suggest the complementary truth if we called him an underachiever. "Is it not passing braue to be a King? " - and the play, in the manner of a cleverly wry erotema , makes us wonder, all the more because Marlowe does not take away the wonder by pointing the moral. As with Barabas, our relationship to Tamburlaine is dynamic: at times we feel the seduc- tive power of his "working words," at times recoil from them, at times feel torn between the conflicting possibilities Marlowe carefully con- trives. Grand sin or foolish mistake? Both possibilities are there, but finally they are not equal. Tamburlaine, taught by his warring nature to aspire, climbs and climbs. It is by turns an impressive and a repulsive spectacle. But at the end he has gotten no further than the earth from which he began. And that is either frightening or funny. Out of the death of his "divine Zenocrate" Tamburlaine creates the most astonishing image of himself as a self-baffled earthly possessor. His hyperbolic rage is what we have come to expect: What, is she dead? Techelles, draw thy sword, And wound the earth, that it may cleaue in twaine, And we discend into th 'infernali vaults, To haile the fatali Sisters by the haire, 21.

(3064-69) The problem with this is not only that we have heard its like before. Here in Part Two we see explicitly what has been implicit throughout, that the real object of Tamburlaine 's revolt is mortality itself. Because he cannot be immortal or make others so he has perversely made himself the agent of death, bursting "The rusty beames of lanus Temple doores, / Letting out death and tyrannising war: / To martch with me vnder this bloody flag" (3082-84) - none of which, however, will make the shep- herd's love "Come downe from heauen and Hue with me againe"(3086). But if he cannot have Zenocrate 's body and soul he can, extraordinarily, have her body: Where ere her soule be, thou shalt stay with me Embalm 'd with Cassia, Amber Greece and Myrre, Not lapt in lead but in a sheet of gold, And till I die thou shalt not be interr'd. (3097-100) Zenocrate 's embalmed presence onstage here in Act Two and ag^in at the play's conclusion can hardly be for the audience the triumphant or consolatory image it is for Tamburlaine. It is merely the most gruesome confirmation of his ordinary mortality. In what he takes to be love T amburlaine is, on his own terms, doomed to defeat, even as he is doomed in war. His great speech on Zenocrate 's beauty - "What is beauty saith my sufferings then?" - is an example of Puttenham's antipophora or "Figure of responce," "when we will seeme to aske a question to th' intent we will answere it ourselues. " Antipophora "is a figure of argument and also of amplification" - the latter, says Puttenham, because in answering our own question we "spend much language."22 Tamburlaine spends much language in this set-speech only to purchase an ironic emptiness. For what he amplifies is absence: beauty is what, when all the poems are written, still will not be expressed; its "argument" is its own negation. The mode is startlingly lyrical, but in other ways the speech is typical: there is something stirring in the idea of the unattainable ideal, but something disturbing too in the inevitable defeat it promises. Even in his more customary role as warrior Tamburlaine dooms himself by the nature of his perverse ideal: "Giue me a Map, then let me see how much / Is left for me to conquer all the world" (4516-17). In an 22. Puttenham, p. 204.</page><page sequence="15">Lawrence Danson 17 interesting variation on the sorrows of Alexander, Tamburlaine weeps because there will always be more to conquer: 44 And shall I die, and this vnconquered?" (4543, 4551). For once, the rhetorical question admits no alternatives. Death itself is what T amburlaine would need to conquer to satisfy his imperial ideal. There is not much place in Tamburlaine, the play or the character, for introspection. But at times there are intimations of an emotion, call it melancholy or despair, which Marlowe will explore in Doctor Faustus. Tamburlaine sorrows for Zenocrate and at his own partial recognition that death will conquer him. In Part One, when he is about to slaughter the virgins of Damascus, he appears "all in blacke, and verie melancholy" - and asking some of his most alarming questions: What, are the Turtles fraide out of their neastes? Alas poore fooles, must you be first shal feele The sworne destruction of Damascus (?] They know my customer could they not as well Haue sent ye out, when first my milkwhite flags Through which sweet mercie threw her gentle beams Reflexing them on your disdainful eies: As now when furie and incensed hate Flings slaughtering terrour from my coleblack tents, And tels for trueth, submissions comes too late. (1845-54) Tamburlaine 's melancholy" is as noteworthy as his insane rigidity. Erwin Panofsky's analysis of Diirer's engraving Melencolia I is apposite to Tamburlaine 's condition as it will also be to Faustus': "Melancholia belongs in fact to those who 'cannot extend their thoughts beyond the limit of space.' Hers is the inertia of a being which renounces what it could reach because it cannot reach for what it longs."23 Tamburlaine is neither a homily against presumption nor an exhortation to dream the impossible dream. It presents an emotionally complex vision of how man may lose the full potential of his humanity in pursuit of an inhuman goal. Ill For all the differences in dramatic mode, Doctor Faustus is caught in Tamburlaine 's dilemma and he more fully is a Marlovian version of Melencolia I: "Winged, yet cowering on the ground - wreathed, yet 23.

Who pulls Faustus down is indeed a question; and it is interesting that the play, for all its theological explicitness, should occasion the most controversy about the nature of Marlowe's theology. Obviously it is not an atheist's play in any sense beyond what an Elizabethan Privy Council might construe. Marlowe told Baines that the Roman liturgy would be most attractive to him were he inclined to be attracted to any religion. Recent critics have explored possible connections between Faustus' despair and Calvinist or Lutheran doctrine. I want to return to these questions by way of Faustus' own questions. Faustus' opening soliloquy is, in Levin's phrase, "an inventory of the Renaissance mind" - or, at least, of the departments of study open to it. For I do not think it true that "Whatever the contemplative life can teach . . . Dr. Faustus has learned."25 Scholars who have achieved a reputation like Faustus' are in danger of being trusted: but from Faustus' first rhetorical question Marlowe does his best to assure that we listen warily, with an almost undergraduate skepticism, to the rest of Faustus' vaunting speech: Settle thy studies Faustus, and beginne To sound the deapth of that thou wilt professe: Hauing commencde, be a Diuine in shew, Y et leuell at the end of euery Art, And Hue and die in Aristotles workes: Sweet Anulatikes tis thou hast rauisht me, Bene disserere est finis logicis, Is, to dispute well, Logickes chiefest end[?] Affords this Art no greater myracle[?] Then reade no more, thou hast attaind the end. (A-text, 30-40; question marks only in B) Marlowe's creative detachment from his speaker is evident even in such 24. Panofsky I, 168. The Chorus speaks of Faustus' "waxen wings" (22), and " Apolloes Laurel bough" (1511 ); "the tools of art and science" are handled by Faustus, literally and figuratively, throughout his first soliloquy; he cowers before Lucifer as he does also before God's ire. 25. Levin, p. 113</page><page sequence="17">Lawrence Danson 19 apparently innocuous phrases as "sound the depth" or "live and die," to which a terrible burden of tragic irony will accrue by the end of the play. Faustus scornfully seeks a "miracle" in Aristotle: as C. L. Barber has written of "the irony which attends Faustus' use of religious language to describe magic" - and as we have seen in Barabas' and Tamburlaine's use of religious language - "the rebels seem to stumble uncannily upon words which condemn them by the logic of a situation larger than they are."26 The rhetorical questions also open out to that larger situation. "Is, to dispute well, Logickes chiefest end[?]" Faustus cites Aristotle but he quotes the anti-Aristotelian Peter Ramus. A modern scholar who noticed the apparent confusion declares that "everyone of [Marlowe's] educated hearers . . . every Cambridge undergraduate" would have recognized Ramus in Bene disserere est finis logicis. 27 Surely this grants too much to the efficacy of even the best Elizabethan education; but Mar- lowe does call attention to the substitution both by having Faustus translate the phrase and by the effect of the erotema itself. For some, at least, in his audience Marlowe has given two allusions for the price of one, and warranted our looking briefly at how both the Aristotelians and the Cambridge Ramists were answering the question of "logic's chiefest end." Thomas Wilson's The Rule of Reason (1551) was the first text-book of logic written in English. It was widely known, although old-fashioned by the time Marlowe was doing logic at Cambridge, and it is firmly Aristotelian. Wilson asks, "Whereof, or to what ende Logique is, " and answers: Manne, by nature hath a sparke of knowledge, and by the secrete workying of God, iudgeth after a sort, and discerneth good from euil. Before the fall of Adam, this knowledge was perfect, but through offence, darknesse folo wed, and the bright light was taken awaie. Wise men therefore, consideryng the weakenesse of mannes witte, and the blyndnesse also, wherein we are all drounded: inuented this arte, to helpe us the rather, by a naturall order, to finde out the tru the. For though before Adams fall, knowledge was naturall, and came without labor, yet no man can now of hymself, attain the truth in al thynges, without help and diligent learnying.28 26. C. L.

The question-and-answer appears in Wilson's second edition (1552); in the first edition he defines logic as "an art to reason probably on both partes, of all matters that be put furth, so farre as the nature of euery thing can beare." The second edition, with an added</page><page sequence="18">20 English Literary Renaissance The end of logic, then, is "to finde out the truthe" in discerning good from evil. Even with logic's aid truth will not, in our fallen state, be easily achieved: the diligence and "naturall order" Wilson commends is in striking contrast to Faustus' recourse to the desperate infantilism of magic, with its "Lines, circles, [signs,] letters and characters: / I, these are those that Faustus most desires" (81-82). The truth that is the end of Wilson's logic goes far beyond that "world of profit and delight" at which Faustus draws up short (83). Although Faustus declares that magic's dominion "Stretcheth as farre as doth the minde of man" (91), Wilson's logic "extendeth, not onely to knowe worldly affaires: but also to knowe God, &amp; all his heauenly workes, so farre as nature may comprehend."29 That knowledge of God is the "chiefest end" of all learning was not a new idea with the traditionalist Wilson, but neither was it outmoded. The great Renaissance ideal was still to be powerfully stated by Milton: "The end then of Learning is to repaire the ruines of our first parents by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love him."30 Abraham Fraunce 's The Lawier's Logike (1588) is aggressively Ramistic. (Fraunce had been at Cambridge from 1575, and was a fellow of St. John's when Marlowe matriculated at Corpus Christi in 1581.) Accord- ing to Fraunce, "to reason well and artificially is the due tie and ende of Logike."31 The art is proposed quite frankly as a way for lawyers to get ahead: the difference in tone between this pragmatic new man and the pious Wilson is striking. But so is the difference, although it appears at first merely technical, between Fraunce 's interpretation of Ramus and Faustus'. The latter renders bene disserere as "to dispute well" ; but Fraunce worries the proper translation: "This our English word, Reasoning, is more proper and fit to expresse the nature of Logike, than either that other word, of disputing, derived from disputare, or the like, as disserere , and docere. " Fraunce acknowledges that Ramus and his translators use both disserere and disputare (Faustus' two choices); therefore "I do not reiect, but by their leaue leaue their Latin words behind our English," the humanistically resonant to reason : preamble including Aristotle's "especial poinctes to examine euery matter, before we take it in hand to teach it to any other" (of which this question of ends is one) significantly modifies the utilitarian note on which the earlier edition opens. 29.

In either system, "this art" does afford a greater miracle, whether it be the sort that belongs to "God, &amp; all his heauenly workes," or the more narrowly humanistic one implied in Fraunce's choice of "reasoning. " The Ramist declares that logic can reach as far as man's reason can reach: it is not, in its "end," only a set of debating points; and the traditionalist makes explicit that its reach extends to the divine realm from which, with all his devilish aids, Faustus will find himself excluded. Faustus dismisses logic: "A greater subject fitteth Faustus wit" (41 ) ; and he thereby confirms himself the merest technician of knowledge, familiar with the number of celestial spheres, their revolutions and axial wobbles, but incapable of considering "who made the world" (694). Faustus mistakes the end of logic because he neglects its full context; he sees the art's letter but not its spirit. It is a mistake to which he is prone not because he is a scholar but because he is human. It is a mistake he will make repeatedly, in the rest of the speech and the play.33 Hardly a word of this questioning first soliloquy is not charged with tragic ironies that accrue through allusiveness and dramatic context. Marlowe's demands upon us to listen - and to hear both what is said and what is significantly left unsaid - make it worth a moment's further consideration. Faustus goes on to question the ends of the various arts, and repeatedly in his answers he draws up short. And increasingly, I think, the speech's intellectual subtext appears more plainly, that the letter kills but the spirit gives life. With a parting glance at Aristotle, Faustus curtly dismisses the philo- sophical problem of being and not-being (42). And from the apparent 32. Sigs. B2V-B3V. Milton's The Art of Logic (1672) is also "arranged after the method of Peter Ramus." And like Fraunce, Milton is uncomfortable with Ramus' pragmatic limitations. To the question, "What is logic?" Milton answers ars bene ratiocinandi, which he translates "the art of reasoning well." Milton declares his preference for the word "logic" over Ramus' "dialectic," and "reasoning" over Ramus' "debating" (Works, 11: 18-19). 33. Cf. G. K.

But what cure is so wondrous that we could be "eternizde" by it? The image of the good physician Christ thus enters the speech. The image is crucial for us, although to the very end the sight of his cure, "Christs blood streaming] in the firma- ment" (1463), will be less compelling to Faustus than that of God's "irefull browes" (1469). Faustus bids Galen come but quotes Aristotle: " Summum bonum medici- nae sanitas, / The end of physicke is our bodies health" (46-47). The dismissive rhetorical questions he now asks are predicated on a limited notion of "the end of physicke": Why Faustus, hast thou not attaind that end? Is not thy common talke sound Aphorismes? Are not thy billes hung vp as monuments, whereby whole Citties haue escapt the plague, And thousand desprate maladies beene easde[?] Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man. (48-53) Context and allusion make it hard for us to exclude our knowledge of what, in another scale of values, "our bodies health" itself is for: "Know ye not, that your bodie is the temple of the holie Gost, which is in you, whome ye haue of God? and ye are not your own" (1 Cor. 6.19, Geneva Bible). According to values the play acknowledges in its rhetorical structures, "the end of physicke" is not the body's health: or, the end of the body's health is not the body's health. Faustus' own desperate malady, like Tamburlaine's, is his dependent humanity: "Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man." Contemptuously dismissing medicine for what he thinks it cannot do, Faustus' questions direct us still more explicitly to a realm where man's sickness is already cured: " wouldst thou make man to liue eternally? / Or being dead, raise them to life againe? / Then this profession were to be esteemd" (54-56). Only in his panicky last half hour will Faustus realize that life is eternal, and his is eternally damned (1481-95). Here at the start the injunction Christ ironically let be applied to himself silently informs Faustus' insufficient examination of the end of physic: "Physician, heal thyself" (Luke 4.23). From medicine Faustus turns to law: where is lustinian? Si vtia eademque res ¡egatus duobus,</page><page sequence="21">Lawrence Danson 23 Alter rem , alter valorem rei, &amp;c. A petty case of paltry Legacies, Exhereditari filium non potest pater, nisi - Such is the subiect of the institute, And vniuersall body of the law. (B-text, 54-60) The case of one object willed to two parties will, of course, be Faustus' case, shortly to be argued by a Good and a Bad Angel. But under the universal body of the law it is everyman's case. According to the spiritual lawyer St. Paul, all men are condemned to death under law but saved by Christ who fulfills the law. The conclusion to the seventh chapter of Romans passionately fights out a version of what Faustus describes as " A petty case of paltry Legacies": I delite in the Law of God, concerning the inner man: But I se another law in my membres, rebelling against the law of my minde, &amp; leading me captiue vnto the law of sinne, which is in my membres. O wretched man that I am, who shal deliver me from the bodie of this death! I thanke God through Iesus Christ our Lord. Then I my self in my minde serue the Law of God, but in my flesh the law of sinne. (Rom. 7.22-25, Geneva) Faustus reads that a father cannot disinherit his son unless - and he breaks off at precisely the question that will most plague him: at what point, fór what cause, is this son disinherited by the father? But because Faustus is the kind of legalist he himself contemptuously describes, "a mercenary drudge, / who aimes at nothing but externall trash" (64-65), the magni- tude of the question will not obtrude on him until, in the desperate plea-bargaining of his last soliloquy, he finds that his case is lost. "When all is done, Diuinitie is best" (67): Faustus' error is not in coming too late to divinity or even in dismissing it. For the point, surely, is that any of the previous branches of learning, properly understood, could have done as well. The repeated error has been in failing to grasp the "chiefest end" of any human endeavor. That, at any rate, is one way of understanding the situation, a way that was available to Marlowe's audience and which Marlowe's allusive technique, his dramatic ironies, and his rhetorical questions seem to me to make inescapable. That pillar of English orthodoxy Richard Hooker provides a good gloss on Faustus' intellectual and spiritual tragedy: Now that which man doth desire with reference to a further end, the same he desireth in such measure as is unto that end convenient; but what he coveteth as good in itself, toward that his desire is ever infinite. So that unless the last good of all, which is desired altogether for itself, be also infinite, we do evil in making it our end Nothing may be infinitely desired but that good which indeed is infinite No good is infinite but only God.34</page><page sequence="22">24 English Literary Renaissance Hooker's syllogism leads to God as "the chiefest end"; in a moment Faustus will construct out of half-sentences from scripture a syllogism that leads to damnation. Marlowe and Hooker do make, as it were, strange bedfellows. But the fact is that Hooker's ideas, by virtue of their very traditionalism, were available ideas, the sort you could not ignore. Faustus turns to Jerome's Bible, bidding himself "view it well" (68). Why his view extends only to the first part of the passages he finds - to the syllogistic conclusion that we must sin and "consequently die . . . an euerlasting death" (75-76), while leaving it for us to hear the merciful conclusion of the unspoken parts - raises the play's thorniest set of questions.35 They are questions that involve inextricably theological and dramaturgical issues. In the B-text Mephostophilis seems to provide an answer: Twas I, that when thou wer't i 'the way to heauen, Damb'd vp thy passage, when thou took 's t the booke, To view the Scriptures, then I turn 'd the leaues And led thine eye. (1989-92) But this answer only makes explicit the question of Faustus' free-will or lack of it: is Faustus damned or does he damn himself? And this in turn raises the question of the dramatic status of Marlowe's palpable devils, angels, and the gaping hell-mouth Henslowe was at cost to provide for this play about the spiritual state of evil. Wilbur Sanders thinks Marlowe is inconsistent or trying to have things both ways. At times in the play "damnation has ... a sharp physical actuality," which seems to Sanders a "medieval" way of look- ing at it; at other times there is a "modern. . . insight into the depths of the damned mind."36 Mephostophilis, for whom "Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd / In one selfe place" (567-68), presumably takes an informed modern view, whereas Marlowe himself too often subscribes to "an older mechanistic demonology." Either hell is real or it is a symbol: that it seems to be both in Doctor Faustus is for Sanders a symptom 34. Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity (1593), Book 1, Chapter 11 (London, 1907; rpt. 1963), 1: 202-03. 35. Among those who have blamed Marlowe for Faustus apparent failure to understand the doctrine he quotes are Michel Poirier, who deplores "the author's nature ... his narrow logic ... his incapacity to understand the grandeur and beauty of the message of Gospel" (quoted by Steane, 162); and Irving Ribner, ed. The Complete Plays (New York: Odyssey Press, 1963), who claims (more temperately) that "Faustus' view of Christianity is the only one made explicit in the play "(Introduction," p. xxxviii). I am arguing, of course, that Faustus, like the other two plays, depends as much on what it implies as on what its characters explicitly state. 36. Sanders, 199-200.</page><page sequence="23">Lawrence Danson 25 of Marlowe's confusion. The really "modern" thing here, however, is the unwillingness to entertain an actuality which is fully symbolic. Symbolically, it is perfectly appropriate that the literal-minded Faustus should be carried to hell by Henslowe's hired men dressed as "realistic" devils. The dramaturgic problem will trouble us only if we see things with Faustian literalism. Even the B-text's explicitness, with Mephostophilis claiming credit for Faustus' predicament, is not inconsistent, although I think it is artistically unfortunate. While Mephostophilis is the cause, he is the cause (as he might say) per accidens; essentially, the cause will always lie "Within the bowels of these elements," ourselves. The problem of conceptualizing the spiritual is inevitable: "The inadequacies of language and man's constant inclination to anthropomorphism led sixteenth cen- tury daemonologists - especially the occult - to speak sometimes of spirits with a circumstantiality not consonant with their knowledge. . . . Though daemons possessed personal form and existence, the minds of men had no images of them any more than of abstract good and evil."37 When Mephostophilis first appears to Faustus as a dragon, he is told by the magician to "Goe and returne an old Franciscan Frier, / That holy shape becomes a diuell best" (269-70) - but no better or worse than another: "Was this the face that lancht a thousand shippes? / And burnt the toplesse Towres of (1357-58). The apparent dramaturgical problem reveals a real theological one. When Faustus tries to leap up to his God, who does pull him down? Is Faustus unwilling still to repent? - for repent he does not, however much he may in his panic regret his fate or plead for leniency. Or is Faustus unable to repent because it is God's will that he be damned? Concerning his syllogism of damnation, Faustus asks "What doctrine call you this, Che sera , sera, / What wil be, shall be?" (77-78). Recently, Charles Masinton has answered the rhetorical question by calling the doctrine "Luther's deterministic theology": Faith in God saves the sinner, but the man who does not already possess it as a gift from God cannot simply decide to have it, since his mind and will are in the devil's control. And without faith, the fallen man - unable to believe that the salvation he fervently desires is possible for him - lapses into despair. This is exactly the case with Faustus.38 37. Robert H. West, The Invisible World: A StudyofPneumatologyin Elizabethan Drama (Athens, Ga, 1939), p. 68. 38 Masinton, 135.</page><page sequence="24">26 English Literary Renaissance Certainly it is part of Faustus' case; the movement toward repentance and the lapsing into despair is the frenetic piston that drives the lurching central portion of the play. But that Marlowe shares Faustus' desperate theology cannot be proven. In the midst of one especially imbecilic prank, his cozening the horse-courser, Faustus pauses, killing time till the punch-line: what art thou Faustus but a man condemnd to die? Thy fatali time doth dra we to finali ende, Dispaire doth driue distrust vnto thy thoughts, Confound these passions with a quiet sleepe: Tush, Christ did call the thiefe vpon the Crosse, Then rest thee Faustus quiet in conceit. (1169-74) For Faustus the recollection of the saved thief is merely a soporific; for others it may be another reminder of the unspoken, merciful half of Faustus' syllogism. The play has its Evil Angel to say "Too late," but its Good Angel too: "Neuer too late, if Faustus can repent" (707-08; in the B-text "will" replaces "can"). Despair does conquer: Faustus' spiritual death-in-life is caught in the frightening oxymoron, "I do repent, and yet I do dispaire" (1330). But just who killed John Faustus is one Marlovian question that remains eternally open.39 Faustus despairs and does not repent - or vice- versa. His end is fully implied in his dramatic beginning, when we hear him questioning the ends of learning and stopping in every case at the killing letter. The questions he asks and the answers he seeks are throughout the play those of the literal-minded man whose finding the knowledge of the world entails the losing of his soul. Pantofsky, in his analysis of Diirer's Melencolia 1 summarizes Henry of Ghent in a way that is strikingly relevant to Faustus. (The word "imagination," as it is used in the passage, is asso- ciated literally with images as opposed to ideas): There exist . . . two kinds of thinkers. On the one hand, there are the philosophical minds which find no difficulty in understanding such purely metaphysical notions as the ideas of an angel or of extramundane nothingness. On the other hand, there are those "in whom the imaginative power predominates over the cognitive one." They "will 39 Cf. Robert G. Hunter's excellent discussion in his Shakespeare and the Mystery of God's Judgment (Athens, Ga., 1976) of how "the moment of Faustus' renunciation of theology . . . can have varying significance for the various kinds of Christian in his audience." Like Masinton, Hunter entertains the Calvinist possibility that Faustus "is one of those whom 'God from eternity . . . hath reprobated to death' " (p. 48). Hunter seems uncomfortable about a deity who makes such an insoluble mystery of his judgments, and implies that Marlowe was similarly piqued. But his analysis shows that the question itself, not an answer to it, is at the play's heart.</page><page sequence="25">Lawrence Danson Tl accept a demonstration only to that extent as their imagination can keep step with it Their intellect cannot transcend the limits of imagination . . . and can only get hold of space [magnitudo] or of that which has a location or position in space. . . . Therefore such men are melancholy, and become excellent mathematicians but very bad meta- physicians, for they cannot extend their thoughts beyond location and space which are the foundations of mathematics."40 Faustus is a dramatic adumbration of those sad thinkers who "cannot extend their thoughts beyond location and space. " The questions he asks can be poignant or ludicrous; in either case they reveal an aspiration stunted by the narrow scope of a mind that will not climb after knowl- edge infinite.41 IV Marlowe's own questions are less naive than those of his heroes. Often they are angry questions. They account for some of the basic difficulties we have in establishing the plays' tone and genre. For a rhetorical question can work in two radically different directions: it can call attention to the obviousness of the correct response or to the distance between the expected response and the correct one. That the question is asked at all implies that something is amiss. It is unsettling because it implies a gap between the standard used in responding and the situation which gives rise to the question, between the affirmation and the interrogation. Marlowe's plays often inhabit that space between affirma- tion and interrogation, that satirical space where interrogatio (when "we do aske . . . because we would know") must be heard as percontatio (when "we do aske . . . because we woulde . . . sette furthe our grief with more vehemencie"). The depressing obviousness of the correct response, for instance, strikes us in the question posed by Orcanes, the King of Natòlia, in Tamburlaine : "Can there be such deceit in Christians, / Or treason in the fleshly heart of man, / Whose shape is figure of the highest God?" (2893-95). The play's action, in which we witness that Christian deceit, directly answers the first part of the question, turning it from interrogatio 40. Panofsky, 1: 168. 41 . A series of articles treating, in a fascinating variety of ways, the ironies of Marlovian aspiration appears in Two Renaissance Mythtnakers, ed. Alvin Kernan, Selected Papers of the English Institute, 1975-76 (Baltimore, Md., 1977): see Marjorie Garber, " 'Infinite Riches in a Little Room': Closure and Enclosure in Marlowe," 3-21; Michael Goldman, "Marlowe and the Histrionics of Ravishment," 22-40; Stephen J.

We cannot so directly witness the disparity between "the highest God" and man's fleshly heart, but the question itself pushes us toward the discovery of it. Neither a statement of the fact ("There is deceit in Christians") nor a simple question ("Is there deceit in Christians?") would carry the force of the rhetorical question, "Can there be such deceit?" - for it makes us freshly aware both that there is such deceit and that there ought not to be. Although it is spoken by Orcanes, its artful "vehemencie" as a question identifies it as Marlowe's own. Barabas asks a different kind of rhetorical question: why, is not this A kingly kinde of trade to purchase Townes By treachery, and sell em by deceit? Now tell me, worldlings, vnderneath the sunne, If greater falshood euer has bin done. (2329-33) If Orcanes' question about deceit was sad because the answer was too obvious, Barabas' question about deceit is outrageous because there is no obvious answer. The difficulty of responding is the point. Apparently it is "kingly" to use treachery and deceit, for kings (we see) use them; but even as we give that response we are doing violence to our standard notion of how kings ought to behave - not merely as an ethical com- monplace but as a matter of language: "kingly" means not treacherous, not deceitful. The question divides one kind of knowledge from another, the knowledge of what is from the knowledge of what ought, by an absolute standard, to be. Marlowe's play exists in the space created by that division, where the language appropriate to one kind of knowledge is forced to speak for the other kind of knowledge. The rhetorical question therefore has the subversive effect of changing any value- laden word into a pun: "kingly" and "deceit" have each come to mean at least two different things simultaneously, as in Doctor Faustus "heavenly" came to mean both itself and its opposite. This is, in small rhetorical compass, the kind of subversiveness Mar- lowe practices in larger dramatic strategies as well. To write in the vein of erotema is to assume on the one hand an absolute standard which can supply the question's answer and on the other a disparity between the absolute standard and the questioner's situation. It is inevitably, there- fore, to write in the vein of satire. In Marlowe the satire can be harsh or rueful, broad or delicate; it can tend toward farce or toward tragedy. These plays have the trappings of a tragic conclusion, but the sense of</page><page sequence="27">Lawrence Danson 29 tragic completion is subverted by the sense of disquieting incompleteness attendant on the questioning mode.42 PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 42. Cf. Joel B. Altman, The Tudor Play of Mind (Berkeley, 1978), which describes the technique of sophistical questioning in utramque partem. Altman 's subtle discussion of Marlowe (which appeared after this article was substantially complete) deserves more attention than I can give it here. I would only notice that the satirical effect of rhetorical questioning (by erotema, percontatio, or antipophora) demands precisely that absolute norm, however indirectly or tacitly perceived, which is absent from the sophistical mode. Altman writes that in The Jew of Malta "no moral norm is ever firmly established" (p. 355); I disagree. And I find Marlowe's outlook essentially of a piece throughout the plays I discuss, while Altman traces through them a course of disillusionment from Tamburlaine ("resounding optimism regarding the ability of man literally to invent his own reality") to a pessimistic "nightmare world" in Faustus (p. 10). On many points, happily for me, we agree.</page></plain_text>
