<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK DEVELOPMENT ALISM IN MAX WEBER SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION: A CRITIQUE OF F.H. TENBRUCK * According to an influential discussion of F. H. Tenbruck(i), Weber's most important work is not Economy and Society but rather the less known collection of works on the sociology of religion originally appearing in 1916-17 in the Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozial politik under the title Die Wirtschaftsethik der Weltreligionen ('The Economic Ethics of the World Religions') and posthumously published (in revised form with additional works) in 1920-21 as Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Religionssoziologie (2). This is because it is in the latter work that Weber most fully elaborates his classic thesis concerning the origin and basis of European modernity—that is, it is there he attempts to show how modern society derives its world historical importance form, and is to be explained in terms of, the twin historical processes of rationalization and disenchantment. According to Tenbruck, this was Weber's greatest achievement and, indeed, the central task around which his vast intellectual output was organized (3). In Tenbruck's reading, what distinguishes Weber's contribution from that of other theorists of rationality and modernity is the claim that the historical course of western civilization, culminating in the scientific and technically-rationalized culture of today, is not to be grasped by positing the progressive enhancement of mankind with respect to its cognitive capacities; rather, this great tranformation must be understood in terms of events and developments which are in the final analysis religious in origin. In elaborating and extending his criticisms of # See F.H. Tenbruck, The Prob lem of Thematic Unity, in the Work of Max Weber, British Journal of Sociology, 31, 1980.

(3) In what follows we shall not raise the issue of the validity of this view of the relative significance of Weber's two great works. The question has recently been addressed in a comprehensive manner by W. Schluchter in his Domination, Religion and Rationalization : A Weberian Perspective (University of Cali fornia Press, 1990), and in our view his criti cisms of Tenbruck on the matter are essen tially correct. 339 Arch, europ. socioJ., XXXIV (1993), 339-363 — 0003-9756/93/0000-630 $02.50 © 1993 A.E.S.</page><page sequence="2">JOHN T. LOVE marxism in early texts like The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Tenbruck argues, Weber came to the view that religion is not merely one of a number of factors at work in historical change but is the decisive element in cultural evolution. This is ultimately because religion is the arena within which 'man produces his cultural reality' (1989: 72). Religion is the focal point of cultural development because it answers to mankind's metaphysical needs—in other words, the religious pro pensity is an expression of our fundamental need to under stand the world and make sense of our place within it. Thus, religion is intimately associated with certain fundamental rationalizing propen sities, and these come to be focused on a problematic which is specific to the religious sphere, namely, the problem of theodicy: according to Tenbruck, 'the rational compulsion, to which all religions have to accede, derives from the need to possess a rational answer to the problem of theodicy' (1989: 65). Furthermore, a logic of development is at work through the historical unfolding of religion, and this is explic able in terms of a quasi-evolutionary dynamic. For, in the last analysis, the stages of religious advance are the more and more articulated conceptions of the problem of theodicy and its solution. This is not the same dynamic as that usually invoked by the advocates of historical progress, which focuses directly on man's technological achievements (e.g., marxism's view of the mankind's ever-increasing mastery of the forces of nature), however, for paradoxically 'the rational unfolding of the problem of theodicy operates in opposition to the world. [Weber] states that a rational development of religious images of the world proceeds apace with the rational logic specific to religion and is not concerned with the question of the cognitive interpretation of reality' (1989: 65). But in what precise fashion does evolution in the sphere of religion occur? And how is the development of religion connected with the requirements of rationality such that it can be said to play a crucial role in the general rationalization of society? At first sight such a role appears unlikely given that, since the Enlightenment at least, religion has been more associated with the opposite, namely the sphere of the irrational. But the relation between religion and reason has been historically highly variable, as we shall see. These, then, are the central issues with which Tenbruck's essay is concerned. He wants to show that, despite the apparent disavowals of his methodological/philosophical reflections, Weber in effect endorses a quasi-evolutionary theory of historical progress. As he puts it at one 340</page><page sequence="3">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK point, 'Weber, who throughout his life had upheld the uniqueness of history against the laws of progress, is now encountered in his work on religion in the opposing camp of evolutionism' (1989: 64). (Parallel interpretations of Weber have recently been developed by Wolfgang Schluchter and Jürgen Habermas, but we shall not comment on those here) (4). In the following essay we shall focus our inquiry on whether this portrayal of Weber as a developmentalist is an accurate account of his position. We shall thus need to consider the role of religion in social and historical life generally from Weber's point of view and ask whether it actually has the overwhelming significance Tenbruck claims. But first we shall explicate Tenbruck's thesis a little further. i. Tenbruck's reading of Weber on religious rationalization According to Tenbruck, in his studies of religion Weber posits the operation of two complementary forces which he believes underlie all religious history; these constitute a kind of anthropological foundation that Weber presupposes in his work but does not seek to establish as such. In the first place, he argues, man is disposed to construct images of the world which must cohere in a special sense: namely, they must satisfy the structure of a theodicy. That is, religious worldviews are constructed in response to extraordinary and sometimes bewildering experiences which present the individuals concerned with apparently insurmountable difficulties for the on-going conduct of their lives. After such encounters, Weber suggests, men and women may attempt to grasp the situation by rendering their predicament in intellectual terms. Human beings possess a powerful urge to 'understand' their lived experience, as this makes it easier to cope with the difficulties of existence, so enabling life to continue with a measure of equanimity. There then follows a second phase of rationalization. For, in establishing an intellectual hold on the world, the understandings gained partake in what we might call, following Piaget, Habermas and others, a 'learning process', because they cannot but aid in the production of further (perhaps deeper) understandings, and lead to the construction of more unified and comprehensive images of the world. The elements of such worldviews become enduring cultural products, which are henceforth (4) W. Schluchter, The Rise of Western Rationalism: Max Weber's Developmental History (University of California Press, 1981) and J. Habermas, The Theory of Communi cative Action (Beacon, 1984). 34i</page><page sequence="4">JOHN T. LOVE available to wider groups of individuals who transmit the under standings achieved to subsequent generations, frequently adding to, systematizing and qualifying the symbolic materials already in cir culation. Relying largely on Weber's argument in the seminal essay 'The Social Psychology of the World Religions' and the early sections of The Sociology of Religion, Tenbruck emphasizes that the starting-point for the rationalization dynamic in Weber's sociology is human suffering. The experience of some kind of pain, deprivation or injustice is for mative because it shatters the naive, pragmatic relationship of man to the world that has hitherto prevailed. In his primordial state, man's intelligence is deployed in an adaptively-rational fashion in the effort to master the conditions of life for the immediate purposes of survival (5). This elementary 'practical rationality', however, sooner or later comes up against limits, for a degree of disappointment in achieving worldly ends is unavoidable—among other things, primitive man possesses only a minimal command over the natural processes with which he must necessarily grapple in the day-to-day struggle for existence. Given such relative powerlessness, then, the initial response to failure and the pain it brings cannot be a completely rational one informed by 'knowledge' in the sense of today's science but is typically a search for what Weber describes as 'magical charisma'; the latter is sought in the hope that the acquisition of extraordinary powers will afford protection against further suffering. But, despite the apparent regression entailed here—the abandonment of a basically rational and practical response in favour of the irrationality of wishful deliverance—the germ of a different, and actually higher rationality is also present. This is because the possibility of finding magical solutions is connected with the feeling that suffering, especially 'undeserved' suffering, is senseless and this, Weber insists, creates a powerful urge to explain the world. Men and women come to realize that the intensity of suffering can be reduced if it can be construed as being not entirely pointless—as being, perhaps, a means to something beneficial beyond pain and misery. In other words, by giving such experiences a 'meaning', by transforming them from a fate merely to be endured into possible means for the attainment of desired states, suffering need no longer be regarded in a purely negative light. It can now be seen as potentially productive and even elevated into something (5) Tenbruck notes in this regard how 'ends-rational action' (to use Weber's key sociological category) is taken by Weber as an original and natural capability of man which does not need to be acquired through learning. 342</page><page sequence="5">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK to be valued (say, in the fashion of labour, which does not simply have to be endured as toil but can be embraced as something ennobling or virtuous). Hence, at the beginning, the theodicy problematic is grounded in an outlook which sees suffering per se as senseless, and which reinterprets experiences of a painful kind as temporary or limited, as in some way capable of being overcome. Out of these fundamentals of the human condition, then, certain anthropological constants are fashioned—suffering, reflective pondering on the meaning of suffering, intellectualization, knowledge creation and, finally, reality testing via action in the world—and these ensure that a dynamic process of continuous rationalization is set in motion. On-going progress is now virtually inevitable because, even though a given explanation of injustice or pain may produce some ameliorating effects, relief is always only partial and does not last—unavoidably, each understanding achieved sooner or later is found wanting in the face of life's ineluctable problems, and this invites renewed efforts to produce a satisfactory (hopefully more comprehensive) account of the world and the suffering which abounds. As Tenbruck summarises, 'the rationality dynamic is based on a necessity to unify that ties the system atization of facts (or their elucidation) into the systematization of action... Weber holds that the original and, in a certain sense, natural relation of man to the world is, subjectively, purposive-rational: because of this man conceives of reality as a multiplic ity of disconnected facts and isolated situations. The effect of this for the individual was that, reality being so splintered, action itself could only be fragmented and situational. Religious development, therefore, is a rationalization, because it systematizes facts (and explanations) and unifies standpoints of action, but always under the spur of" charisma tic " needs and so leads to further questions of theodicies' (1989: 70). These processes can be demonstrated by considering the various stages in the advance of religious culture through time. Primitive ani mism, for example, leads to the view that like objects must be controlled by like forces, and this eventually gives way to more anthropomorphic projections wherein motivation is attributed to the powers which lie behind the events and phenomena of nature. A shadow world of spirits and demons is gradually brought into being through which the expe rience of suffering and misfortune is interpreted and made 'meaningful'. Later, with theism, suffering is conceived of as punishment by gods (i.e., divine revenge) or is deliberately produced in the form of sacrifices aimed at placating wrathful deities in advance (e.g., mortification). Yet another stage is reached when punishment is seen to arise as a conse quence of the transgression of a deity's explicit commandments—of course, here, with the attempt to normatively order the world, we see the beginning of ethical religion in the strict sense. 343</page><page sequence="6">JOHN T. LOVE According to Tenbruck, the construction of worldviews in history can be understood in terms of a developmental sequence, though this does not necessarily imply a belief in progress as such. From the vantage point of the present, the observer can without great difficulty recognize a series of learning stages that have been arrived at over the course of historical life: The monotheistic concept of a supramundane God, for Weber, was another idea that first had to be conceived and, once accepted, had far-reaching consequences. Fully formed, a new idea proposed that there was a punishing and rewarding deity, par ticularly so, when taken with the further supposition that the destiny of men in this world and beyond was directed essentially according to the observance of ethical commandments. A further new idea is represented by ethical prophecy (Sendungs prophetie), as in Judaism, because man then had to consider himself acting in the world as the instrument of God. A further extension of this—again a new idea—is the Protestant belief in predestination (1989: 68). Speaking of the culmination of this process in the West, Tenbruck says: 'the inner logic of religious rationalization is responsible for the unfolding of an idea which had first emerged in the Judaic ethic but had remained latent until it was reborn and finally realized fully in the inner-worldly asceticism of Calvinism. Weber herewith joined up the beginning and the end of the process of religious disenchantment in the comparative study of religious rationalization' (1989: 74). The Weberian view of the role of ideas in history according to Tenbruck is such that Weber did not even need to undertake a more complete exposition of Occidental history than what he covered in his studies of ancient Judaism and Protestantism (the beginning and the culmination of western history)—i.e., the interventing period does not warrant the same detailed scholarly attention (6). For the ideas involved in religious evolution have a logic and dynamic of their own which means that the data of empirical history can to some degree be passed over: using Weber's famous railway metaphor, Tenbruck says, 'Behind the ebb and flow of history, Weber reveals in bold outline how ideas perform the role of switchmen' (1989: 374). Now does all this mean that for Weber the course of history under the influence of these evolving religious worldviews must follow a path of increasing rationality? Let us note here that the celebrated metaphor Tenbruck invokes is interpreted by him somewhat one-sidedly. After all, Weber's main point had been to underscore the significance of interests (both ideal and material) rather than to advocate the auton (6) This does not seem to accord with Weber's stated intention to write a work on early Christianity which only failed to appear, it would seem, due to his untimely death. There is also the fact of Troeltche's work with which Weber was in great sympathy. 344</page><page sequence="7">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK omous power of ideas. Though clearly Weber does not wish to reduce ideas to mere epiphenomena or effects (as in Marxism or Nietzsche), they are never regarded as entirely independent forces as in idealist historiography from which Weber always dissociates himself. None theless, for Tenbruck, the position is clear that, regardless of his methodological equivocations, Weber effectively endorses a develop mentalist view and thus must be understood differently than has hitherto been the case. Certainly, as far as the West is concerned, Tenbruck is convinced Weber's perspective is deeply structured by evolutionary considerations, though not, as we have said, in the simple linear, cumulative sense of earlier philosophies of progress. In attempting to clarify this reading, Tenbruck argues that with Weber's explication of the process of rationalization we find ourselves confronted with a kind of 'multilinear genealogical tree': As in a decision tree, this can run along several paths, some of which are 'blind', others going further to higher levels which is why, in universal-less historical terms, they were both successful and consequential. Whether a society remains stationary at one point, or whether it is embarked upon a particular path depends on circum stances. For every option taken, other future options are excluded. The 'genealogical tree' reproduces the specific logic of religious rationalization and the directional role ( Weichenstellung) of ideas. The genealogical tree performs two functions: it presents the important facts of the developmental history, and provides an ideal-typical explanatory schema of religious rationalization. While allowing for deviant and intermediary forms, Weber claims that from a universal perspective explanatory hypotheses and history coincide. There is a historical probability that some of the developments specified in the genealogical tree will in fact follow in the direction outlined (1989: 70-1). The idea of a genealogical tree is attractive at first glance because it allows for a degree of diversity, and even a certain measure of dis continuity, in the course of actual historical life which seems to cor respond with the uneven advance of civilizations without at the same time denying coherence and a consistent direction overall. But in arguing this way Tenbruck is in our view weighting the problem of theodicy and estimating the role of religious ideas not only differently to that expressly indicated by Weber himself on a number of occasions but, more importantly, is interpreting against the grain of Weber's whole interpretative effort. Comparing Weber's numerous specific statements on these matters, it has to be admitted, can be somewhat confusing at first glance. For example, Weber at one point makes the claim that: 'In one form or another, this problem [of theodicy] belongs everywhere among the factors determining religious evolution [Entwicklung]' (1968: 519). But is this equivalent to saying that the problem of theodicy is the decisive 345</page><page sequence="8">JOHN T. LOVE factor in religious evolution? Insofar as he posits a general basis for the religious disposition, an underlying precondition of the spiritual pro pensities of man, in our reading this has to do primarily with the issue of 'meaning' and not with theodicy in the strict sense. Thus we find statements like: 'Behind [religions] always lies a stand toward something in the actual world which is experienced as specifically " senseless they reflect the demand that the world in its totality is or could or should be, a meaningful "cosmos" (1948: 281). But these remarks do not imply the necessity of an articulate theodicy; they merely recognize the intimate association of religion with the experience of suffering and the disposition to interpret the world in some way or other (7). Besides, even when Weber turns specifically to the problem of theodicy (e.g., as he does in The Sociology of Religion or in 'Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions') some of the discussion is designed to show that the issue is of consequence only under special circumstances; he does not invoke it as a fundamental and abiding force of religious culture. This explains why one of his concerns in The Sociology of Religion is in fact to demonstrate how the problem of theodicy becomes pressing only under very particular historical circumstances, for example, with the advent of ethical monotheism. In this regard, he says, 'the more the development [of the notion of god] tends towards the conception of a transcendental unitary god who is universal, the more there arises the problem of how the extraordinary power of such a god may be reconciled with the imperfection of the world that he has created and rules over' (1968: 519). But the problem of theodicy is not necessarily the central feature in all religious traditions, such as those where a universal conception of the divine is lacking altogether. As Weber explains: 'by no means every ethic traversed the entire length of the road culminating in these [ethico-religious conceptions associated with theodicy]. Thus the ethics of Confucianism lack the concept of any integral diabolical power of sin. Nor was this notion contained in the ethics of Greece or Rome' (1968: 438) (8). Clearly in these passages Weber is not invoking anything like a universal process of rational (7) In what follows we shall distinguish theodicy in the strict sense from a looser, more general usage. The former derives from theology and finds its classic expression in Leibniz's 1710 «Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme, et l'origine du mal ». The question is simply how evil can exist given the creation of the world by an omnipotent and benevolent god. A more sociological usage has come about more recently, however, especially since Peter Ber ger's The Sacred Canopy (1967) where it is argued that every social order implies a the odicy. (8) We shall note here that Weber says the problem of theodicy can arise in other ways than via transcendental monotheism: as he explains, 'even a meaningful world order that is impersonal and super-theistic [such as that conceived by Hinduism] must face the prob lem of the world's imperfections' (1968: 519). But more on this later. 346</page><page sequence="9">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK ization to be understood in terms of a single thread of development focused on the problem of theodicy. But if the theodicy question is not as decisive as Tenbruck would have it, what nonetheless is Weber's view of the nature of religious evolution, of the role of theodicies, and of the relation of religion to cultural and societal rationalization generally? To fully resolve these questions, it would be necessary to engage at some length with the not inconsiderable complexities of Weber's substantive work on religion, a task which is beyond the scope of the present essay. A preliminary clarification of the issues is, however, possible, so the remainder of this easy will attempt a beginning of this task. 2. Weber's account of religious evolution : from magical asceticism to salvation religion In what follows we shall consider some aspects of Weber's essay 'The Social Psychology of the World Religions' and the opening sections of The Sociology of Religion, for it is in these texts that he provides his most condensed view of the historical evolution of religious phenomena (9). But first we must make some comments about the use of the concept 'theodicy'. Although Weber does not expressly adopt the term theodicy as a formal sociological category to describe any religiously coloured attitude to the experience of misfortune, it seems that in discussing early attempts to account for suffering and its opposite he sometimes has in mind the idea of an elementary or primitive theodicy. Thus, we suggest at the outset that it is worth distinguishing two usages of the concept: there is (a) the usage which refers to any effort, regardless of the level of theoretical sophistication and rationality, to account for the existence of suffering and to specify means for its overcoming; and there is (b) the specific, theologically-articulated problematic which focuses explicitly on the manifest discrepancy between destiny and merit in an effort to provide an exhaustive account of the distribution of good and evil; this (9) It is noteworthy how at the outset of his discussion Weber insists that, 'However incis ive the social influences, economically and politically determined, ... [a religious ethic] receives its stamp primarily from religious sources, and, first of all from the content of its announciation and promise' (1948: 270). In other words, there is a distinctly religious domain, which means one can never fully understand the significance of a given religious phenomenon by, say, reducing it to a class's 'ideology' or seeing it as the 'reflection' of a stratum's material or ideal interest situation. But having said this, Weber proceeds to consider at some length the Nietzschean theory of 'resentiment', which is clearly highly reductive. 347</page><page sequence="10">JOHN T. LOVE tends to arise with the more advanced stages of religious development when rational theology has produced a metaphysical worldview. In what follows we shall keep these two meanings in mind in order to clarify Weber's position and to correct Tenbruck's reading which, in our view, tends to run the two together. In looking at the earliest stages of religious development Weber first considers the situation when religion and magic are hardly distinguish able. In this connection he refers to the very common, relatively 'unproblematical' attitude to suffering which he maintains is not par ticularly difficult to understand—namely, what he says is essentially the 'pharisaical outlook'. This confident, self-satisfied attitude entails accepting the existing distribution of pain and well-being in the world as somehow divinely sanctioned: those who are at present esteemed, powerful, wealthy or happy understandably wish to enjoy a 'legitimate' good fortune; whereas those who have been unable to escape lasting and unbearable suffering are callously deemed to deserve their unhappy fate. But more interesting and historically consequential than this negative attitude to pain and misfortune, in Weber's estimation, has been the contrary view—the deliberate glorification of suffering (10). He refers to the many forms of chastisement, of abstinences from normal diet, from sleep, and from sexual intercourse, which have been expressly cultivated to awaken, or at least to facilitate, what he calls the charisma of ecstasy, vision, hysteria, or any other extraordinary states that can be evaluated as 'holy'. The peculiar prestige of these practices has arisen from the idea that certain kinds of suffering and other abnormal states brought on through various forms of self-denial are ways to achieve superhuman, that is, magical powers (1948:271-2) (i i). In attempting to characterize the situation out of which religious phenomena proper first appear, Weber surmizes that in the earliest times communal cults must have been concerned largely with the immediate material interests of the political or clan association and did not make special provision for individual needs. In such times when (io) Though he warns against the dangers of a simplistic application of Nietzsche's theory and insists that many religious phenomena have nothing to do with 'resentiment', Weber concedes that the 'evaluation of suffering' with which Nietzsche is concerned has been of enormous significance. But Weber does not in the end accept a Nietzschean view of the significance of religion, and instead advances his own perspective in which the problem of rationality figures in a way not found in Nietzsche. (ii) Thus for Weber, as for Nietzsche, the magico-religious impulse is at its beginning very closely associated with the positive evalu ation of suffering. But contrary to Nietzsche, Weber argues that there is more to subsequent developments than a straight-forward inver sion of the self-justifying attitude of the pri vileged, for the thesis of a 'slave revolt in morals' is an all too simple explanation of what in fact are very complex problems of social ethics. 348</page><page sequence="11">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK someone sought relief from extreme suffering—for example, from sickness or from life-threatening afflictions—they would have had no alternative but to turn to the assistance of outside figures, generally those whose success as miracle workers was known. But under certain conditions an independent religious 'community' was able to emerge which promised the salvation of individuals as individuals. Somehow a charismatic figure arose who led the community in developing a specifically religious/salvation orientation. Thereby the magician was transformed into a mystagogue. Typically, Weber tells us, 'this head has either been recognized as the incarnation of a superhuman being or merely as a prophet, that is, as the mouthpiece and agent of his god. Collective religious arrangements for individual " suffering " per se, and for salvation from it, have originated in this fashion' (1948: 272). Thus, he suggests, to some extent in parallel with Nietzsche's view, that the focus of subsequent religious development involves a shift away from the political unit and the interests of its ruling stratum toward the salvation needs of the masses. But the service of plebeian interests in this way, which was the special concern of the 'redeemer', signalled an important change in other respects as well—for it was directly implicated in the construction of a specificially rational image of the world (Weltanschauung). As Weber puts it: 'This religiosity presupposed the myth of a saviour, hence (at least relatively) of a rational view of the world. Again, suffering became the most important topic' (1948: 273). At this earliest stage of religious development, the hope for salvation was largely bound up with the observance of rituals and was not concerned with ethical conduct in the strict sense. However, wherever the promise of a redeemer has been associated with the phenomenon of prophecy, Weber claims, the idea of 'sin' understood as more than a mere magical offence began to figure. Whilst as a rule prophecy has not been a product of the intellectual horizon of depressed social strata, once created, it has almost always gravitated to such groups as a supplement to magic. For this to occur, however, an inversion of the dominant classes' account of the causes of distress had to occur, and this was often the distinctive achievement of the mythical worldview of the redeemer: 'A rational theodicy of misfortune has, therefore, as a rule, been a development of this conception of the world. At the same time, this rational view of the world has often furnished suffering as such with a 'plus' sign, which was originally quite foreign to it' (1948: 274). Thus, in distinguishing religion from magic, Weber emphasizes the increased rationality of the world images involved; that is, this transition 349</page><page sequence="12">JOHN T. LOVE is marked by the development of more abstract and comprehensive (i.e., metaphysical) accounts of suffering and the means for its alleviation. Even the most primitive religious form like the orgy, Weber says, 'has not entirely lacked a meaningful interpretation, although only the rationalized religions have imputed a metaphysical meaning into such specifically religious actions, in addition to the direct appropriation of sacred values' (1948: 278). The advent of religion proper, thus, is brought about through processes of both intellectualization and ration alization, and involves the creation of theodicies in the rudimentary sense distinguished above. It is the role of intellectuals to attach the primitive need for redemption to a worldview which promises more than immediate deliverance from particular distress or sufferings: 'Yet redemption gained a specific significance only where it expressed a systematic and rationalized " image of the world " and represented a stand in face of the world' (1948: 280). The same point is developed in The Sociology of Religion where Weber distinguishes priests from magicians on the basis of the contrast between those who develop rational training in doctrines focused on some notion of redemption and those with a merely empirical training oriented to producing 'awak ened' states aimed, say, at rebirth or some kind of personal transform ation (12). Weber goes on to argue that this fostering of a rational worldview is an event of far-reaching historical significance. What is more, the initial articulation of a theodicy is intimately tied to the development of a general propensity to rationalize the image of the world. He mentions the resort to primitive nature myths concerning the changing seasons and the regular movement of celestial bodies as analogies on which expectations about the return of good fortune were frequently constructed. Depending on how saviour figures were derived (whether through a process of abstraction or by their ascent from ordinary human experience), differing accounts of the economy of salvation and its variation over time were produced. Of course, unique historical cir cumstances conditioned the specific forms involved, and Weber insists that the development of society in economic, technical and scientific terms also contributed in important ways to the advance of rationality; this is because the generation of abstract and increasingly precise concepts greatly facilitates the creation of a more comprehensive and articulate theory of the world process. (i2) Thus, 'the outstanding marks of [priestly] doctrine are the development of a rational system of religious concepts and (what is of the utmost importance for us here) the development of a stable doctrine which pur ports to be a " revelation (1968: 426). 35°</page><page sequence="13">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK Now, according to Weber, a further transformation in the in terpretation of suffering occurs with the advent of gods who punish and reward conduct judged by purely ethical standards. This entails an important alteration in the meaning of suffering: from its use as a source of charismatic states (e.g., mortification) in the enhancement of magical coercion or as a supplicatory self-punishment designed to avoid divine wrath through repentance, suffering may be cultivated in the form of ascetic self-denial which is interpreted as more pleasing to ethically judging gods who are above concern with conventional worldly pursuits and pleasures. Then, with the idea of monotheism the ethicization of conduct is advanced even further. Weber observes that, as long as there are numerous Gods, and other spirit beings, men can serve these in a somewhat ad hoc fashion according to the separate and conflicting demands of each (13). By contrast, with the idea of a single and all powerful God the world comes to be conceived of as his creation and an image of it is fashioned which encompasses the manifold heterogeneity of reality within a unified conception. All facets of existence can now be brought within the purview of a single realm of being in terms of which everything can be 'explained' (14). With monotheism both the realm of nature as well as the sphere of the human social order are deemed the work of God, who is not the refore subject to the same moral 'fate' (moira) as man but is rather concerned to protect these domains as his own creations. Whereas hitherto there had basically been only two ways of influencing super natural powers—either by placating their egoistic desires through worship or by coercing them through magic—with monotheism a third method emerges, namely, social action guided by ethics. Conduct deemed ethically proper is regarded as pleasing to such a God because the directing norms are believed to be a product of his wisdom (1968: 431-2) (15). It is of considerable importance for the subsequent devel opment of religious culture that herewith a differentiation occurs (13) This was paradigmatically the case with the gods of the classical era, especially in ancient Greece. In W. Burkert's study , Greek Religion, we read how the polytheism of the Greeks meant 'that many gods are worshipped not only at the same place and at the same time... only the totality of the gods constitutes the divine world. However much a god is intent on his honour, he never disputes the existence of any other god... What is fatal is if a god is overlooked... To overlook or despise a god is to curtail the richness of the world and hence the fullness of man' (p. 216). (14) From this point on, according to Tenbruck, the problem of theodicy becomes a continuous one in which the demand for intellectual consistency drives the effort to comprehend the world to ever higher achieve ments. (15) This development is the subject of the most interesting work of Martin Hengel which is concerned to show the profound influence of Greek philosophical and scientific thought on the so-called wisdom literature of the Bible. See in particular his Hellenism and Judaism. 35i</page><page sequence="14">JOHN T. LOVE between the demands of God and those deriving from society or nature, a radical opposition which is the ultimate source of the characteristic religious Angst with which believers must henceforth cope (i 6). Given the ascetic basis of ethical religion, there is now a powerful tendency for theistic reflection to push in the direction of other-worldly concerns, and this gives the religious domain a distinctively irrational character from the point of view of everyday practical concerns. As Weber summarizes: Every aspect of religious phenomena that points beyond evils and advantages in this world is the work of a special evolutionary process, one characterized by distinctively dual aspects. On the one hand, there is the ever-broadening rational systemization of the god concept and the thinking concerning the possible relationships of man to the divine. On the other hand, there ensues a characteristic recession of the original, practical and calculating rationalism (1968: 424). But the growing ethicization of conduct flowing from the process of religious rationalization creates a special problem which becomes more pressing as time passes. For, the inceasing standards of rationality in the interpretation of the world which have become a common currency mean that the religious consciousness must sooner or later face the problem of why the distribution of fortune among men does not coincide with their manifest goodness at any given time. In times of social turmoil or as a result of rapid historial change, the awareness of injustice becomes especially acute: 'Individually " undeserved " woe was all too frequent; not " good " but "bad " men succeeded...' (1948: 275). A crisis arises within the existing theodicy of suffering, and this promotes renewed efforts at comprehending the ethical irrationality of the world. The new emphasis on ethics is not abandoned, however, and is actually reinforced as religious speculation resorts to more sophisti cated (roundabout) explanations of the links between suffering and sin. Suffering might be explained as a consequence of sins committed in previous lives, guilt inherited from ancestors, or the wickedness of all creatures per se. To these explanations correspond specific promises of compensation: the hope for a better life in the future (transmigration of souls), belief in a messianic deliverance for future generations, or the hope for a perfect life in another world beyond the present (paradise, heaven). (i6) We have deliberately evoked Kierke gaard's concept of Angst at this point as in our view it captures extremely well the nature of the religious field that is brought into being by these developments. 352</page><page sequence="15">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK 3. The significance of rational theodicies We come at last to Weber's more detailed treatment of the problem of theodicy, where he focuses on the stricter meaning of the term distinguished above. There are three main occasions where Weber gives an extended account of the nature of theodicies and their significance—in The Sociology of Religion, in 'The Social Psychology of the World Religions', and in 'Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions'—and, while there is considerable overlap and repetition between these, the separate analyses are not in agreement in every respect. We shall first consider the account contained in 'The Social Psychology of the World Religions' because this seems closest to the exposition provided by Tenbruck. In the key section, after referring to the general difficulty of how any theodicy of suffering can cope with the actual distribution of suffering in the world (quoted just above), Weber writes: The metaphysical conception of God and the world, which the ineradicable demand for a theodicy called forth, could produce only a few systems of ideas on the whole—as we shall see, only three. These three gave rationally satisfactory (my italics) answers to the questioning for the basis of the incongruity between destiny and merit: the Indian doctrine of Kharma, Zoroastrian dualism, and the presdestination decree of the deus abscondidus. These solutions are rationally closed (my italics)... (1948: 275). In this passage 'rational satisfaction' and 'rational closure' both seem to refer to the general level of theoretical comprehensiveness, consist ency or coherence achieved. The idea of 'rational' satisfaction implies that those seeking an intelligible account of the distribution of good and evil will be convinced on some level that an adequate explanation has been provided. They will believe that the crucial elements of the human situation, the key moral phenomena and their vicissitudes, have all been grasped or comprehended. The idea of 'rational closure' seems to go further and suggests that this process has achieved something like completion: in such circumstances there is no longer any need to resort to ad hoc or extraneous propositions to account for variations in indi vidual destiny. In 'Religious Rejections' Weber gives an illustration of what he has in mind by theoretical consistency in discussing the case of dualism: Dualism maintains that always the powers of light and truth, purity and goodness coexist and conflict with the powers of darkness and falsehood, impurity and evil. In the last analysis this dualism is only a direct systematization of the magical pluralism of the spirits with their division of good (useful) and evil (harmful) spirits which represent the preliminary stages of the antagonism between deities and demons. Zoroastrianism was the prophetic religiousness which realized this conception most 353</page><page sequence="16">JOHN T. LOVE consistently... In the most consistent eschatology, the world of purity and the world of impurity, from the mixture of which the fragmentary empirical world emanated, separated again and again into two unrelated realms (1948: 358). Here 'consistency' clearly denotes a theoretical schema that, within the framework of a basically theistic framework, offers a comprehensive and exhaustive account of the existence of good and evil, with no aspects being unexplained, ambiguous or left in mystery. But how exhaustive is it possible to be? And, is it possible to specify the standards of comprehensiveness that underlie Weber's classification? To understand these issues more clearly, it is worth considering Weber's contrasting discussion of what we might term 'inconsistent' or 'less consistent' responses to the problem of theodicy. The relevant discussion can be found in The Sociology of Religion, in Section vm which is devoted to 'Theodicy, Salvation and Rebirth'. After making the general observation that the problem of theodicy is made more urgent with the advent of transcendental gods whose extraordinary power has to be reconciled with the injustice and imperfection of the world as it is, Weber embarks on a discussion of the range of possible responses. (Though he does not expressly label this an account of inconsistent theodicies, in effect this is what follows). He tells us that 'one solution is to assure a just equalization [of fortune] by pointing, through messianic eschatologies, to a future revolution in this world. In this way the eschatological process becomes a political and social transformation of this world. This solution held that sooner or later there would arise some tremendous hero or god who would place his followers in the position they truly deserved in the world' (1968: 519). But, with the passage of time, when the coming of a messianic kingdom seemed unduly delayed, the development of ideas about a realm of life after death caused eschatological expectations to be focused almost exclusively on otherworldly concerns, and this led to a number of possible outcomes: 'Thus, a very widespread view is that the souls of the dead may be incorporated into animals and plants, depending on the souls' different manners of life and death... This is the source of all conceptions regarding the transmigration of the soul' (1968: 520). One can see how in these views a great range of interpretations of the fate of individuals is possible most of which are the product of fairly obvious and understandable projections of a wishful nature. But, where the ethicization of the god-concept occurs via the sublimation of the inner- and other-worldly values associated with his creation, a further accentuation of the theodicy problem is brought about which promotes a potentially more rational and consistent re sponse. As Weber explains, under these circumstances 354</page><page sequence="17">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK the problem of the world's imperfections press into the foreground of thought; this happens the more life here on earth comes to be regarded as a merely provisional form of existence when compared to that beyond, the more the world comes to be viewed as something created by god ex nihilo, and therefore subject to decline, the more god himself is conceived as subject to transcendental goals and values, and the more a person's behaviour in this world becomes oriented to his fate in the next (1968: 521). Weber then refers to the type of 'solution' this prompts: the direct inversion of the primordial view—that fates in the after-world will run parallel with those of this world—with the idea that 'the last shall be first' and vice versa. He goes on to say, however, that 'this view has seldom been worked out consistently...' (1968: 521). The reason for this largely concerns the fact that the rich and powerful (i.e., those who often control the content of religious ideology) have had little or nothing to gain by such an attitude. So religious practices engendered by such ideas have tended to compromise on the decisive issue, frequently oscillating between contradictory positions; commonly they have simply not accepted a complete inversion of fates in the afterlife. A further advance in consistency in the solution of these difficulties, according to Weber, has been the view 'that there would be concrete retribution of justice and injustice on the basis of a trial of the dead, generally conceived in the eschatological process as a universal day of judgement. In this way sin assumed the character of a crimen to be brought into a system of rational casuistry...' (1968: 521). This position offers higher consistency because the ethical merits of individuals and their specific actions is taken into account, thus avoiding the need to make sweeping and less plausible judgements about whole classes of people. But again there have been problems in following through the implications of such a doctrine with full consistency. In principle, Weber explains, it is possible for sins to be fully atoned for by merits gained or punishments undergone, but in practice, because of uncer tainties about the afterlife and what is achievable in such an unknown realm, the complete remission of grave sins is usually deemed impos sible. Here the power interests of the priestocracy has typically made itself felt by insisting that salvation can only be completely assured via its own hierocratically-administered means (sacraments etc.). Now if these illustrations show what Weber means by 'inconsist ency'—the main examples here are from Judaism and pre-Reformation Christianity—perhaps we are now in a better position to characterize consistency as such. We have already discussed dualism which for Weber is one example of a consistent theodicy, but importantly this is not the highest form known. It comes as something of a surprise, given the supposed centrality of Western rationality in Weber's work, that this 355</page><page sequence="18">JOHN T. LOVE distinction is reserved for the Indian Kharma doctrine—on two occa sions Weber refers to this as being a virtual model of consistency, so it is worth considering these remarks in detail. In 'Religious Rejections' Weber credits the influence of Indian intellectualism with having produced one of the most original solutions, to the problem of theodicy, which 'stands out by virtue of its consist ency as well as by its extraordinary metaphysical achievement' (1948: 359). Indeed, according to the parallel discussion of The Sociology of Religion, the Karma doctrine is 'the most complete formal solution to the problem of theodicy' (1968: 524). By emphasizing the 'formal' nature of the solution, Weber implies that the problem of the distri bution of good and bad fortune is at the very basis of the Hindhu view of the cosmos and is not dealt with in a secondary, ad hoc fashion as an afterthought arising when difficulties emerge with an initial doctrine. That is, with the Karma doctrine the world is conceived as a cosmo logical order constructed in its very fundaments around the varying fates of human actors according to the differing moral worth of their deeds. As Weber puts it, the world is viewed as a completely connected and self-contained cosmos of ethical retribution. Guilt and merit within this world are unfailingly compensated by fate in the successive lives of the soul, which may be reincarnated innumerable times in animal, human, or even divine forms. Ethical merits in this life can make possible rebirth into life in heaven... What may appear from the viewpoint of retribution as unjust suffering in the present life of a person should be regarded as atonement for sin in a previous existence. Each individual forges his own destiny exclusively... (1968: 525) This is a more complete solution to the problem of theodicy than, say, Zoroastrian dualism, because it avoids the temptation of the latter to abandon the strict equality of good and evil forces in favour of an eschatology that gives final victory to a good god. The Parsees and the Gnostics are illustrative of this weakness for, despite their theoretical commitment to dualism, these religions have in practice been unable to accept limitations on divine power (17). Along similar lines, though even less consistent, is the Christian view which not only makes the god of purity and benevolence triumph but conceives of the devil as god's own creature in order to save the notion of divine omnipotence. We come finally to Weber's third pure solution to the problem of theodicy, the predestination decree of the deus abscondidus. The context of both his discussions (in 'Religious Rejections' and The Sociology of (i7) As Weber explains, 'The final victory of the god of light in the ensuing struggle is generally regarded as certain, and this consti tûtes a deviation from strict dualism' (1968: 524). 356</page><page sequence="19">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK Religion) implies that the development of the doctrine of predestination is a clear response to a perceived inadequacy in the notion of god in dualist theodicies, especially when this god is believed to be omnipotent and ethical. In The Sociology of Religion Weber explains this as follows: As people continued to reflect about the insoluble problem of the imperfections of the world in the light of god's omnipotence, one result was inevitable: the conception of an unimaginably great ethical chasm between the transcendental god and the human being continuously enmeshed in the toils of new sin. And this conception inevitably led to the ultimate conclusion, almost reached in the Book of Job, that the omnipotent creator God must be envisaged as beyond all the ethical claims of his creatures, his counsels impervious to human comprehension (1968: 522). Now in what precise sense this is a 'solution' to the problem of theodicy is not entirely clear from Weber's several discussions. If we take the above remarks at face value, it seems that by 'solution' here Weber is refering to the idea of taking certain premises to what we typically call their 'logical conclusion'; that is, Weber is pointing to the capacity human beings not infrequently exercise of 'thinking through' a set of premises so all that is logically entailed is made clear and ad equately addressed. But there is a development here that adds an important twist to the whole issue, for the term 'solution' in the above case has quite different connotations than in the previous examples we have discussed. For here the implied achievement is not that a rationally satisfactory answer to the problem of accounting for good and evil in the world has been reached. Rather, the point is that metaphysical spe culation has come to the point where the very possibility of such an answer has been rejected. Consider the following discussion of Calvi nism which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a definitive grasp of the significance of worldly success and failure when the meaning of god's omnipotence is fully acknowledged: [Only Calvinism] so emphatically affirms the nature of the divine to be an essentially dynamic activity manifested in god's personal, providential rule over the world. Moreover, there is no view of the religious relationship which holds such firm views regarding god's discretionary grace and the human creature's need of it, regarding the tremendous distance between god and all his creatures... For the very reason that this religion provides no rational solution to the problem of theodicy (my emphasis), it conceals the greatest tensions between the world and god, between the actually existent and the ideal (1968: 523). In other words, with Calvinism a kind of theologically-inspired nihilism is all but endorsed, which radically questions the capacity of human beings to comprehend a world in which apparently undeserved suffering and unmerited good fortune abound. The harsh doctrine of the double decree that follows from the Calvinist conception of god refuses to offer any consolation to the mass of ordinary human beings 357</page><page sequence="20">JOHN T. LOVE who remain attached to worldly investments and goals and believe these have something to do with their salvation. Thus, paradoxically, the Calvinist worldview does not 'make sense', is not intelligible, in the fashion hitherto associated with the quest for rational meaning. The strict teaching of Calvinism thus effects a 'disenchantment of the world'—the radical elimination of the conviction that human existence has any intrinsic meaning or purpose—that is directly parallel to that brought about by modern science. (Here Weber's argument is very close to Nietzsche's view, that the heightened will to truth induced by Christianity eventually comes to question even the value of goodness and leads to the discovery that ethics is fundamentally compromised because it depends on immoral means to enforce its moral order). On these matters it is worth considering the corresponding remarks in 'Religious Rejections' where Weber writes: The belief in predestination realizes this renunciation [of God's benevolence], in fact and with full consistency. Man's acknowledged incapacity to scrutinize the ways of God means that he renounces in a loveless clarity man's accessibility to any meaning of the world. This renunciation brought all problems of this sort to an end (1968: 359) To be sure, it must be said that in this case a kind of conclusion is reached because of Calvin's determination to systematically think through the consequences of certain premises of orthodox Christian belief, but the ultimate point at which he arrives as we have seen is not strictly that of a 'solution' to the problem of theodicy but rather, as Weber's insists, of the 'impossibility' of any such thing. Let us turn briefly to Calvin himself and his explicit treatment of the problem of theodicy. It should be noted that before Calvin's time the problem of theodicy had already played a significant role in Christian thought. The highly ethicized god-concept of Judaism which early Christianity inherited had reinforced the view that moral considerations must underlie God's treatment of human beings both in this world and the next. Under the impact of eschatological ideas, however, other worldly concerns had become so pressing that life on earth came more and more to be regarded as a provisional stage, a mere interlude in the larger cosmic time-frame. At the same time, further sublimation of the god-concept reduced its anthropomorphic content to an absolute minimum, creating a highly abstract and transcendental conception of the deity. All this had the effect of making it very difficult to reconcile the notion of an ethical and benevolent god with the idea of an omnipotent being who routinely resorts to the use of immoral means 358</page><page sequence="21">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK (deliberate inflictions of pain and loss) in order to punish transgressions against his moral order (18). Weber argues that Calvin's position is arrived at 'inevitably' not in any Hegelian emanative sense but, rather, because in the realm of ideas only some conclusions are possible from given premises. The rational elements of religious doctrine thus not only have a measure of 'auto nomy' vis-à-vis the social interests that run parallel, but can on occasion be of considerable consequence for the course of historical life. Which is why Weber writes: 'the rational religious pragmatism of salvation, flowing from the nature of the images of God and the world, have under certain conditions had far-reaching results for the fashioning of a practical way of life' (1948: 286). Thus, it was of the utmost importance that the Israelite god had been from the outset a war god of the confederacy and that he remained a god of history throughout, a god especially concerned with the politico military destiny of his people. As Weber further explains, 'he was no god with whom one could seek mystical union by contemplation, but a superhuman, yet understandable personal master whom one had to obey. He had given his positive commandments which one had to follow. One could enquire into his divine purposes, the reasons for his wrath, and the prerequisites of his mercy, just as with a great king. Beyond that, there was nothing' (1952: 225). This meant that it was virtually impossible to speculate about the 'meaning' of the cosmos, say in the fashion of Indian religious thought. The Judeo-Christian god always had a lofty, transcendent character, whatever the compromises reached concerning his approachability for the sake of satisfying the worldly needs of ordinary people. From such a view of the nature of god, only certain views about the relation of man to the divine are readily conceivable. In his account of Calvinism Weber emphasizes that a distinctive feature was its deter mination not to shirk the full implications of the Judeo-Christian concept of god. This had not been typical of the approach of Cathol icism which for a variety of reasons had reverted to either dualism or polytheism. Insofar as the belief in God's omniscience was rigorously maintained, however, the most consistent position as regards the existence of evil and punishment in the world required denying the complete benevolence of god. Hence, Weber points out, it was Calvin's (i8) As is known, Nietzsche makes much of this and like contradictions. They represent genuine absurdities which show the hypocrisy and contradictoriness that underlies moralizing thought as such: because of its reliance on immoral means, morality must always be in bad faith and therefore must be understood as a ruse designed to conceal non-moral interests of various kinds. 359</page><page sequence="22">JOHN T. LOVE achievement to confront this difficulty with the utmost directness, clarity and single-mindedness. But in our understanding, Tenbruck's claim that the solution to the problem of theodicy is at the heart of religious rationalization for Weber is a questionable view. While it is undeniable that thinking around this question has at times been most consequential for the historical devel opment of religion, as we have seen, it is not the case that Weber believes that this problem and its solution are in some sense primary or axial for the understanding of this history. Under certain circumstances, to be sure, the theodicy issue and the accompanying responses have become especially significant, and no adequate account of the religious sphere could afford to ignore its pertinence, but the same can also be said of numerous other elements in religious life. Weber's general view is perhaps best stated when he says: 'a rational element has played its part, namely, the structure of a special theodicy. The metaphysical need responded to the awareness of existing and unbridgeable tensions, and through theodicy tried to find a common meaning in spite of all' (1948: 358). Conclusion Let us now summarize and review the argument presented. We have argued that Tenbruck's interpretation is misleading on several counts. First, as regards Weber's alleged 'developmentalism', a number of points need clarification. For instance, we would like to know in more precise terms what is entailed in the claim that Weber is a devel opmentalist or evolutionist as regards his view of history. For it is one thing to point to a series of causal connections between certain events and phenomena in history and quite another to say there is a logic of development (like that of the Hegelian or Marxian dialectic or, say, Heidegger's history of Being) or a 'mechanism' of some sort which underpins the entire process (as with selection in evolution and social systems (Darwin, Luhmann), or the so-called monopoly mechanism of state formation in (Elias). Thus, when Weber uses terms like 'evolution' or 'development', we should not necessarily impute a strong meaning of the kind suggested by Tenbruck with its associations with philosophy of history. There is, we submit, a quite other emphasis in the use of these terms that issues from Weber's methodological writings. Given his account of the genetic ideal-type and its use in causal analysis, it follows that in the study of highly rational cultural phenomena, like western 360</page><page sequence="23">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK theology or modern science, an historical account will necessarily take on some of the characteristics of a 'rational reconstruction', to use the formulation of Imre Lakatos. In other words, as long as we are inte rested in a phenomenon because its cultural interest depends at least in part on its rationality, we will inevitably tend to highlight those aspects that have to do with rationality in order to see how what we deem the 'essential' features have been built up. (This need not entail the total exclusion of non-rational elements, however, for these may well be of interest in addition either intrinsically or in explaining the genesis of specific rational achievements (consider the role of charisma in the founding of religious movements or intuition in scientific discovery). But as Weber himself concedes, a certain 'one-sidedness' in representing historical reality is unavoidable owing to the value-relevant basis of concept formation). Thus, in speaking of developments like, say, the discovery of the theory of relativity, it is, we submit, permissible to speak of an 'evolution' in the sense that we maintain that a set of initial ideas (e.g., those in circulation at the time preceding Einstein and associated with figures like Newton) were crucial for later achievements, that these earlier notions can be said to have contributed to the emergence of subsequent theories. This does not mean that the final truths arrived at were somehow 'destined' to occur by an inner logic (history is never necessary and outcomes could always be different); merely that we judge the earlier conditions to be decisive for unders tanding later developments. Or, to use Weber's methodological conceptualization, there exists a relation of 'causal adequacy' between the two sets of phenomena, for the likelihood of the discovery of relativity would have been greatly reduced without the theoretical achievements of Newtonian mechanics. A qualified use of terms like evolution and development is justified, then, not by reference to a direct analogy between history and biological evolution but rather because the historian presupposes a degree of rationality on the part of actors who under specified conditions are judged to have a high probability of arriving at certain theoretical conclusions. Thus, in the case of the study of paradigmatically rational phenomena (like theology science or modern forms of economic thought and practice), we understand the kind of thinking involved with the aid of that nomological knowledge which tells us how anyone might rationally arrive at certain conclusions from given premises. A devel opmental sequence can always be constructed after the event which shows how a perfect series of rational deductions would have unfolded had not certain irrational elements 'interfered' (as is almost always the 361</page><page sequence="24">JOHN T. LOVE case to some degree in actual reality). In some historical situations, however, the ideal case and reality coincide to a significant extent: certain individuals or groups may choose courses of thought and action which we can only understand by acknowledging a rational basis. It is in this context that Weber makes the remark in the 'Religious Rejections' essay which refers to the general significance of the rationalizing pro pensity of man: 'For the rationality, in the sense of logical or teleological " consistency ", of an intellectual-theoretical or practical-ethical attitude has and always has had power over man, however limited and unstable this power is and always has been in the face of other forces of historical life' (1948: 324) (19). The significance of the theological 'solution' arrived at by Calvinism thus cannot be that it represents the culmination of a process of religious rationalization begun in ancient times. For if its position vis-à-vis theodicy was all but attained as early as the time of Job, it can hardly be argued that the full development two millennia later in the fifteenth century required such a long intervening period to reach fruition, as if successive generations continued to chip away at the problem until the ultimate breakthrough was achieved. The historical significance of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination is not that it 'solves' a great metaphysical puzzle and thereby ushers in a new era of disenchantment. The relation of Calvinism to disenchantment is complex and many-sided. On the one hand, its complete rejection of magical means can be very closely correlated with the advance of science and tech nology, with a culture of calculation and rational control (cf. the Merton Thesis). On the other hand, however, Calvinism, as Weber explains, also provides a meaningful orientation to the modem world as a whole, and indeed possesses a tremendous world-transforming power because of the way it creates such a vast gulf between reality and the sphere of the divine. Thus, while it in one sense participates in the disenchantment process—by eliminating the possibility of finding a divine purpose in specific events and actions—it also has the effect of making the whole realm of worldly affairs the arena of god's activity, thereby giving powerful stimulus to the ascetic conduct of mundane affairs. Insofar as Weber sees a line of development connecting the begin ning and end of western history—as is suggested in the celebrated but clearly equivocal remarks with which the 'Author's Introduction' begins (19) Of course, such rationality says nothing as to precisely when and where specific deductions will be made, nor does it mean that the direction taken by a given course of rational action can be read off from its orig inating conditions—by attending to the logic of a supra-historical Reason, for example. 3 62</page><page sequence="25">A CRITIQUE OF F. H. TENBRUCK (1930: 13)—it concerns not only rationalization but also the related processes of intellectualization and disenchantment (1948: 155). To be sure, all this is very definitely associated with religion in important ways (old Hebrew prophecy, systematic theology, the Reformation, Calvinist theology); but equally significant are certain non-religious developments such as Hellenistic and Renaissance science (1930: 105), the French Revolution, the modem state, Roman law, and lastly, of course, capi talism.
