Reviewed for PAS by William M. Hunter, whunter@heberlingassociates.com. Geographer, Heberling Associates, Inc., Alexandria, PA, 16611 I first encountered Sticks and Stones: Three Centuries of North Carolina Gravemarkers while struggling to understand the rural cemeteries in Cincinnati, Ohio, that had languished in the shadow of the more famous Spring Grove Cemetery. Sticks and Stones was an important reference for my interpretation of these complex landscapes that provided a useful guide to headstone types, descriptive terminology, and symbolism of the gravemarkers. This book, along with the work of cemetery historians Richard Meyer and David Sloane, were invaluable starting points for my survey and valuable tools for my detailed assessment. I sense that Ruth Little has experienced much the same sense of serendipity and wonder in her career as an art historian and historian for the North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office, experiences that imbue her work with a very evident affection for her subject and her home state. Little arranges Sticks and Stones, winner of the 2001 Harriet Merifield Forbes Award from the Association of Gravestone Studies, into six chapters, with a preface and conclusion, followed by two appendices, a glossary, notes and a selected bibliography. The first chapter, "Cultural Clues in Old Graveyards," although the most uneven in content and style, is an effective introduction to the terms and concepts revisited throughout the later chapters. Two regional chapters, perhaps better subdivided into three (Coast, Piedmont, and Mountains), follow the introductory chapter and preface the discussion of the stonecutters themselves. The biographies of backcountry stonecutters, itinerant and resident 140 Material Culture</page><page sequence="2">marble cutters and commercial marble yards follow the regional surveys. A chapter on the "living vernacular" of twentieth-century markers provides a refreshing interlude before the too-brief concluding chapter. Years of experience and statewide perspective make the discussion of the profound regional differences that are reflected in the graveyards and markers a strength of the work. For example, Little notes that the class distinctions of the Coastal graveyards, expressed in both the arrangement of burials and the types of monuments, are absent in the Piedmont and Mountain regions, an egalitarian ethic displayed in the church cemeteries of the Scots-Irish as well as the highly structured space of Moravian graveyards. The large numbers of cemeteries in the Piedmont region, preserved because of the widespread practice of church burial, contain an especially rich collection of vernacular art in comparison to the Mountains and Coastal Plain. This is a function of natural forces such as hurricanes and rising water levels combining with cultural and economic forces such as the dissolution of large farms and estates. Initially, the treatment of subjects within the first chapters seems uneven, with some topics receiving extensive analysis and others only a short summary. The many very specific examples also impede the flow of the narrative at times, but then suddenly reappear within later chapters to good effect. The sometimes bumpy rhythm of the writing is relieved by the many clever turns of phrase that are scattered throughout the text; phrases such as "crisp elegance," "calligraphic excesses," and "ghostly anthropomorphic sticks" lift the tone of even the most descriptive sections of the book. Many of the richest insights emerge unexpectedly from the text, hidden within the descriptive paragraphs and the many specific examples. The idea that the cemeteries themselves served as the classroom for many stonecutters allows us to begin to understand the persistence of scripts, motifs and overall style over time, resulting in considerable stylistic variation among geographically proximate graveyards. Valuable insights include: the notion that epitaphs are a sign of a commercial gravemarker; that signatures suggest that the marker was shipped out of the home market of a stonecutter; that many stones were ordered in groups and/or backdated; that backdated stones often reflect the sudden appearance of a gravemarker artisan in an underserved area; and that the fullness of the popular tree-of-life motif relates to the life of the deceased. Indeed, there are surprising discoveries throughout the book. Little s focus on the work of stonecutting and the networks of production are a welcome perspective on the production of cemetery landscapes. The flow of the narrative quickens a bit as Little moves from the regional frameworks into a discussion of backcountry stonecutters. The story of the early stonecutters, a detailed look into the lives and practices of several generations of Piedmont stonecutters that illuminates several of the themes introduced in the opening chapters, is another strength of the book. The examination of the evolution of workshops allows the reader to grasp the influence of a discrete craft tradition, as well as to understand the diffusion of fashion and style into the backcountry. In the stories of these stonecutters, we can see the transitions, experiments, and Vol. 41 (2009) No. 1 141</page><page sequence="3">eventual development of signature characteristics in both the form of the markers and style of its markings, specifically within the symbols themselves. Little offers a clear explanation of the economic integration of the coastal elites in all aspects of the Atlantic trade, as reflected by the importation of gravestones to the stone-scarce coastal plain being one of several trade goods circulating between Europe, northern cities and the coast. Little notes that availability of design catalogs, which offered an expanding array of exotic symbols and motifs, were linked to the development of the rail network and its relationship to large marble and granites operations, an evolution that marked the end of the regional character and cultural distinctiveness of North Carolina gravemarkers. The chapter on marble yards and marble cutters is the most accessible and cohesive of the book as Little begins to tie the many threads left throughout earlier chapters together. Earlier references and examples recur as Little explores work of marble cutters from inside and outside the state. The range of the stonecutters is considerable, including Connecticut factorymen shipping markers throughout the coast, itinerant craftsman working their way from market to market, and the generations of established resident craftsmen who established regional traditions and architects who extended their art to gravemarkers. These stories highlight both the dynamic nature of the craft and the consistency of style that unified the work of New England merchants and backcountry stonecutters. The life stories of the stonecutters themselves provide an excellent window into the evolution of stone and marble cutting. For example, the long career of resident stonecutter George Lauder brought many of the broad themes of the book into clear light. The evolution of the large-scale commercial marble yards in the late nineteenth century brought the work of most artisans to a conclusion, ushering in careers of a new generation of stonecutters, who, like John Thomas "Mac" McLean, were born into the golden age of railroads and of the modern marble yards. Little s telling of the story of author Thomas Wolfe's father, the cosmopolitan marble cutter William Wolfe, employs literature to illuminate the nature of work during this era. The chapter concludes with the end of the marble era, brought about by new technologies and the rise of the granite industry, robbing the gravemarkers of regional differences and relegating gravestone carving to the status of a lost art. The book continues with an insightful chapter on "The Living Vernacular," a discussion of vernacular white and African-American gravemarkers in the twentieth century. It is a refreshing diversion from the collage of stories about the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and an important reprise of the earlier, abbreviated, discussion of African American gravemarkers. Littles comparison of geographically proximate cemeteries that bear very different landscape signatures reveals modern racial distinctions. Although the discussion of "white traditions" and "white churches" assumes cultural unity within a racial category that can be a bit jarring to a reader unaccustomed to such distinctions, practices such as the maintenance of "shells graves" - dirt mounds covered with seashells - clearly demarcate racial differences in the contemporary landscape. Little shows us how 142 Material Culture</page><page sequence="4">the earthen mounds, wooden headboards, and array of cast concrete markers that characterize African American graveyards reflect the work of folk artists like Issiah McEachin, as well as hundreds of anonymous concrete artisans, all working within a racialized environment. The chapter demonstrates that, regardless of racial affiliation, the traditional grave mounds, headstones, enclosures, and sculptures are a continuation of the long tradition of North Carolina grave marking. The final chapter serves as a summary rather than as a discussion of overall findings, a disappointment given the amount of work that went into and affection that drove this survey. The question of what the gravemarkers can tell us about ourselves and our "culture" remains largely unanswered. Yet, the book as a whole allows the reader to revisit long familiar graveyards armed with new insight, opening up new avenues for inquiry and understanding. The book would benefit greatly from a more extensive and skillful use of maps. Only four maps are included in the text, two of which are reproductions, one is a location map and one a useful and important map of the North Carolina Railroad network in 1900. A more extensive use of maps to ground the parade of places that appear in the narrative would enhance the readability. Cemeteries, like other forms of material culture, are readily mappable, opening up the question of how cemetery location relates to the variations of the gravemarker form and ornament. The elegant photography throughout the book is exceptional, exhibiting absolute professionalism in the selection of shots, framing, filtering, and timing of each image, teasing out both the realism of the gravemarker and the mystery of the lives that surrounded it. The photographs clearly display the visual impact of each marker, even if the captions do little to interpret the marker for the reader, instead allowing the photographs to speak for themselves. To photograph so many sites in so many widely separated locations, and to do so with skill and a clever eye, should have earned Tim Buchman status as a co-author of the work. The author s other figures and illustrations, from line drawings to the reproduction of advertisement and funeral invitations, complement the photographs and strengthen the narrative. The prominence, number and quality of the photographs and the overall production value of the book, which include its large size (7 3/4 x 11 inches), full partial page duotone photographs, heavyweight of the paper and glossy finish, are more typical of a coffee table book than an academic treatise. Consequently, only a small percentage of readers may be drawn fully into the text. Initially, I was going to recommend Sticks and Stones for use as reference material, reflecting my initial reading of the work. After all, establishment of the typologies and the clear definition of terms captured by the well-developed glossary is an important contribution of the book. Yet, a cover-to-cover reading of the text is a valuable experience that illuminates every subsequent visit to a graveyard or cemetery. Whether Sticks and Stones represents a systematic study of gravemarkers is debatable - it is not an analysis of a large body of consistently collected and geo-referenced data typified by the recent work of Wilbur Zelinsky - Little succeeds in her qualitative synthesis of a huge amount of information drawn Vol. 41 (2009) No. 1 143</page><page sequence="5">from a wide range of sources, a tremendous accomplishment. Little s hard earned insight, when combined with Buchman s extraordinary photography, makes Sticks and Stones a useful addition to the professional, academic or avocational literature on cemeteries and grave markers.
