As has now been relatively well-documented, from the seventeenth century through the eighteenth natural philosophy occupied an important position in Brit ish women's education. It was generally perceived as an effective means by which they could achieve edification and amusement while also continuing to fulfill their female duties. Extensive formal education was not an option. For the most part, Englishwomen received their education through private study; their learning was primarily shaped by personal tutors, family members, and themselves rather than by the classroom.6 An enterprise designed to be pursued, at least initially, by the individual and to be open even to those with the least expertise, natural philosophy proved to be particularly amenable to this pedagogical situation.7 The popular Ladies Diary, published yearly for over a century beginning in 1704, illustrates the prominent place natural philosophy held in female education. The virtual "School" that The Diary facilitates encourages women to perform their own astronomical investigations and associated mathematical calculations.8 It also invites them to employ receipts devised by famous natural philosophers of the day, including no less than those of "The Honourable Robert Boyle." The Diary evokes what had become a common assumption by the time of its publication?that natural phi losophy is a valuable pursuit for the fair sex. The seventeenth-century polemicist Bathsua Makin had even gone so far as to assert, "To buy wooll and Flax, to die scarlet and purple, requires skill in natural philosophy."9 While it is likely that not everyone in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England would have agreed with the precise import of this somewhat radical statement, most would have agreed with its spirit; "skill in natural philosophy" was of value to women in their work. After all, while virtuosi were preparing receipts in their laboratories, women were doing so in their kitchens.10 Haywood is therefore far from alone in extolling the benefits of natural philosophy to women. This essay argues, however, that the specific recommenda tions she gives regarding women's philosophical pursuits set her apart from her contemporaries, and attest that she has greater ambitions for female philosophers than is immediately evident. In one of the few scholarly treatments of Haywood's portrayal of natural philosophy in The Female Spectator, Barbara Gates and Ann Shteir argue that Haywood's periodical "promulgated gendered notions about women and knowledge," identifying it with a broad cultural phenomenon of the second half of the eighteenth century according to which female education was encouraged, but primarily as a tool women could employ to help them fulfill their domestic duties.11 Their reading thus accords with what has long been the standard perception of Haywood's periodical as a strict, moralistic text, designed to help</page><page sequence="3">Girten / Unsexed Souls 57 women conform to the boundaries society sets for them. In contrast, I demonstrate that, though Haywood pays lip service to a gendered division of knowledge, the pursuit of knowledge that she recommends to her female readers by her own ex ample undermines this division. On the one hand, she celebrates natural philosophy for allowing women to achieve enjoyment and knowledge while simultaneously satisfying their domestic responsibilities. However, I contend that, on the other, she also demonstrates that it may be employed by women to expand the horizon of, and thereby reshape, the sphere to which they are consigned. Through the practice of natural philosophy, Haywood suggests, women may turn their ostensibly trivial lives into lives of public significance, thus challenging the gendered separation of spheres that enables their confinement. This essay shows that the use to which Haywood puts natural philosophy is informed and justified by two key characteristics of England's new science. The first is its propensity to transform small, mundane, and mean objects into things to be admired. The second, even more significant, is its close association with the Christian tradition of meditation. Haywood suggests that Christian meditation attests to, and provides a means by which to realize and express, the fundamental sameness and thus equality of men's and women's souls. So, too, does natural phi losophy, for it is a spiritual act closely connected to, if not identical with, meditation. The status of their souls therefore entitles women to be perceived as men's peers in both contexts. Consequently, according to Haywood, women should not confine their philosophy?or, for that matter, themselves?to the accepted female station, convinced of their inferiority to men in all things intellectual, of public significance, or both. Rather, philosophy can and should provide a vehicle by which women may assert themselves intellectually and publicly alongside men. Haywood's relationship to natural philosophy is thus distinct from its con ventional celebration as a harmless pastime for women to enjoy while conforming to society's expectations. Indeed, far from exhibiting such submission, Haywood's treatment of natural philosophy in The Female Spectator could legitimately be compared to a work like Woman Not Inferior to Man: Or, A short and modest Vindication of the natural Right of the Fair-Sex to a perfect Equality of Power, Dignity, and Esteem, with the Men. Published under the pseudonym of "Sophia, A Person of Quality" in 1740, this work boldly challenges women's separate and intellectually subordinate status.121 contend that Haywood poses a similar challenge with her treatment of natural philosophy in The Female Spectator. As she does so, she distances herself from rather than conforms to the contemporary conduct literature that scholars have regularly assumed to provide the most proximate context for Haywood's periodical?works like The Compleat Housewife: Or, Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion (1728), according to which women's respectability is directly determined by their success in the domestic sphere.13 Thus, what has come to be known as the first periodical written by a woman for women might be understood, at least in its portrayal of female philosophic education, better as part of a countermovement of women's writing than as a mouthpiece for dominant gender ideology of the time. As is the case with all of the correspondence Haywood incorporates into her periodical, it is unknown whether the letters addressed by Philo-Naturse were in fact composed by an actual reader or whether Haywood authored the letters</page><page sequence="4">58 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 herself. What is clear is that she enthusiastically approves of their sentiments. She provides his initial submission with a glowing introduction, referring to its author as "ingenious," even stating that "our Society takes a particular Pleasure in pub lishing [it]; as it agrees so exactly with our own Sentiments, and is what we would wish to say ourselves upon the same Occasion" (PS, 3:82). She goes on to welcome further submissions from him (PS, 3:90). The primary aim of Philo-Naturse's corre spondence is to encourage women to pursue the educational opportunities afforded by "'the Study of Natural Philosophy'" (PS, 3:83). So enthusiastic is Haywood's approval of his advice that she and her fellow female spectators decide to follow it themselves, proceeding on a visit to the country with microscopes in hand. She documents this "Ramble" in detail two issues after the one in which Philo-Naturae's first letter appears (PS, 3:161). Philo-Naturae expresses high hopes for Haywood's female readers. In his first letter, he even goes so far as to imagine them contributing to the Royal Society: "'As Ladies frequently walk out in the Country in little Troops, if every one of them would take with her a Magnifying Glass,... [t]hey would doubtless perceive Animals which are not to be found in the most accurate Volumes of Natural Phi losophy; and the Royal Society might be indebted to every fair Columbus for a new World of Beings to employ their Speculations'" (PS, 3:88-89). However, the ambi tiousness implied by this imagined scenario is balanced by other moments in Philo Naturse's correspondence, which are more circumspect in their vision for women. For instance, earlier in his letter, he celebrates the capacity of natural philosophy to allow women to comply with the constraints society imposes on them even as they seek out opportunities for entertainment and self-improvement. Intending to prevent women from employing natural philosophy as a vehicle for escaping the confines of the female station, Philo-Naturae makes sure to distinguish the practice he recommends from the more abstract observations pursued by philosophers such as Newton and Malebranche: '"The Ideas of those great Men are not suited to every Capacity;?they require a Depth of Learning, a Strength of Judgment, and a Length of Time, to be ranged and digested so as to render them either pleasing or beneficial'" (PS, 3:83). Echoing Malebranche's own statement that "[a]ll things of an abstracted Nature are Incomprehensible to [women]," Philo-Naturas suggests that the fair sex lacks the "capacity" required to realize the value inherent in such ideas.14 The type of natural philosophy he envisions for Haywood's female readers is of a different sort, based on empirical investigation rather than abstract reason ing. Philo-Naturae here goes out of his way to keep women's aspirations as well as their inherent intellectual aptitude in check.15 As he does so, he suggests that the particular variety of natural philosophy he recommends is uniquely valuable because it enables women to continue to fulfill their female duties while they pursue pleasure and education. Therefore, here his advice appears to comply with, if not enforce, the convention of confining women to the private domain.16 Philo-Naturse illustrates how compatible conventional femininity is with empirical practice as he claims an association between women and popular objects of empirical investigation. Of caterpillars he writes: "Even those Worms which appear most despicable in our Eyes, if examin'd into, will excite our Admiration:?To see how in those little</page><page sequence="5">Girten / Unsexed Souls 59 Creatures Bodies are cased in Bodies:?How, when one Form grows with ered and decayed, the happy Insect has another in Reserve, and, shaking off the old, appears again in all the Freshness and Vigour of Youth:? What would a certain Lady, often taken Notice of in your Essays, and many other antiquated Beauties, give, they had the same Power?" (FS, 3:84) Philo-Naturse here forges an anthropomorphic connection between "Worms" and women that implicitly pivots on the similar "littleness" of their "Bodies." Inviting Haywood's female readers to identify with caterpillars, he not only encourages them to take a special interest in the "little Creatures" but also demonstrates the com monplace notion that women's lives are intrinsically amenable to natural philoso phy?that it can be easily practiced within the female domain.17 As his description of "'the Ladies who keep Silk-worms'" attests, natural philosophy is only a small step away from female "Finery": "They will tell you those pretty Creatures, from whose Bowels so much Finery is derived, after having finished their Work, erect themselves little Tombs, such as I have mentioned, and then revive in Butterflies in order to propagate their Species'" (FS, 3:85).18 Philo-Naturae thus brings natural philosophy home to Haywood's female readers, making it seem familiar and easily incorporated into their daily lives. Philo-Naturse's impulse to provide Haywood's female readers with a par ticularly feminine philosophic practice is at odds with his proposal that women may, as a result of their empirical pursuits, become valuable contributors to the Royal Society?which envisions them exiting the conventional female domain. The Royal Society excluded women from its proceedings; at the time of The Female Spectator's publication, only one woman?Margaret Cavendish?had ever even attended a meeting. Though Philo-Naturae does not go so far as to imagine Hay wood's female readers attending Society meetings or becoming members, he does invite them to participate in this exclusive assembly through print, by prompting revision to "the most accurate Volumes of Natural Philosophy" relied on and pub lished by its Fellows. That Philo-Naturse refers to women as "fair Columbuses" only highlights the way in which this passage, in contrast to those explored above, opens the door for women to step outside femininity, even to engage in an act of figurative transvestism.19 Thus, there is a tension in Philo-Naturse's correspondence between his desire to keep women in their place by making that place more pleasant, and his hope that women might venture into more masculine locales. He portrays women both as delicate "Enliveners of Society" for men and also as determined explorers whose philosophical curiosity, once ignited, could defy boundaries. On the one hand, his advice accords with the contemporary expectation that women would practice natural philosophy from within their station, and thus only as a casual and private pastime. On the other, however, he suggests the possibility that women's philosophical pursuits might accrue substantial authority and thus become worthy of public acknowledgment. It wasn't until later in the century that a female philosopher would be formally recognized by the Royal Society. In 1786 the astronomer Caroline Her schel discovered what Fanny Burney subsequently termed "the first lady's comet," and as a result was lauded?and even promised a ?50 salary?by the king. Soon thereafter, the Royal Society published a number of Herschel's comet sightings</page><page sequence="6">60 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 in its Philosophical Transactions (1786), followed by her Index to Flamsteed's Observations of the Fixed Stars (1798). These mark the first instances in which women's philosophical work was explicitly documented by the Society. Toward the end of her life, in 1828, Herschel became the first female member of the Royal Society, after having received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.20 Thus, Philo-Naturse is at least fifty years ahead of his time in his "fair Columbus" fantasy. As Maria Jacson's 1797 Botanical Dialogues attests, even at the end of the century women were generally invited to accrue knowledge, but simultaneously expected to "avoid obtruding their knowledge upon the public."21 Though they had for years served as private helpmates to male virtuosi, female philosophers would have to wait several decades for their contributions to be publicly acknowledged in the "Volumes of Natural Philosophy" produced by the Royal Society and for the Society to admit its "indebtedness" to them.22 Philo-Naturse helps envision the path for precisely such a development with the advice he offers to Haywood's female readers. As the Female Spectator herself proceeds to follow Philo-Naturae's advice during a trip to the country, she provides an example of how women may pursue this more visionary aspect of Philo-Naturae's recommendations. Haywood and her fellow female spectators are met with bad weather when they venture to "a Country Seat, belonging to our President, the excellent Mira . . . furnished with Microscopes, and other proper Glasses, in order to make those Inspections [Philo Naturae] recommends," and are therefore "obliged ... to stay, for the most part, within Doors" (FS, 3:161). Thus, from the outset of their trip, their opportunities for exploration seem destined to be radically limited. However, the female specta tors make the most of their rural retreat and manage to conduct a number of quite detailed empirical investigations in spite of the limits the weather imposes upon them. Indeed, one soon forgets that their investigations have been constrained by "continual Rain" and "poisonous Dew" (FS, 3:161 ).23 Caterpillars are among the few creatures left in the open after the storm? small and common insects that one might expect to offer little opportunity for exploration. However, Haywood explains that she and her fellow female spectators "were very much diverted" in observing them. They remark "how, on the least Touch, they shrunk themselves up into a little Heap, or Ball, by the Help of Rings placed at certain Distances round their Bodies." Their investigation does not stop here. Haywood recounts: "We also took Notice, that the Difference of their Colours proceeded from the different Herbage on which they fed; but none of us were able to conceive what it was gave them those beautiful gold Specks, with which some of them were adorned." As this passage demonstrates, the female spectators manage to engage in acts of discovery in spite of the bad weather and the limitations that it poses. Thanks to both the "very ingenious Gentleman, who sometimes assisted [their] Speculations" and, more importantly, their own scrupulous attention to detail, the female spectators are able to use the caterpillars to brighten their holi day. Perceived with a philosophic eye, these "little Creatures" become endlessly enlightening (and entertaining) objects of inquiry, as stunning as the sun whose "Heat" and "Rays" their bodies miraculously transmute (FS, 3:161). I would suggest that the confinement produced by bad weather during the female spectators' trip to the country parallels that more fundamental confine</page><page sequence="7">Girten / Unsexed Souls 61 merit associated with the traditional domestic sphere. Both require women to stay "within doors," to maintain a private existence closely identified with the home (FS, 3:161). As The Spectator attests, "Female Virtues" were perceived by Hay wood's male contemporaries to be "of a Domestick turn."24 Even when women made their way out into the public domain, they were expected to preserve a certain amount of privacy. Haywood does so in The Female Spectator by situating the "Meetings" upon which it is supposedly based in the female spectator's "Lodgings" rather than in the more public space of the coffeehouse, the site claimed by Addison and Steele in The Spectator. Furthermore, both confinements also entail a close identification between women and trivialities. Richard Steele was far from alone in thinking, "Were the Minds of the [female] Sex laid open, we should find the chief Idea in one to be a Tippet, in another a Muff, in a third a Fan, and in a fourth a Fardingal."25 Eighteenth-century women were regularly satirized for their attachment to trifles and figured as embodiments of the insignificant little things they were perceived to adore. The connection between women and that which is trivial (in size, impor tance, or both) provides an important context for both Philo-Naturas's association between insects and women, and the female spectators' encounter with caterpillars and other such diminutive creatures during their visit to the country. Because the brief confinement the female spectators endure on account of bad weather points to the broad confinement that conventional femininity demanded, their employment of natural philosophy to brighten their holiday has profound implications. It suggests that empiricism has the potential not simply to entertain women on a rainy day but also to liberate them from the confines of their quotidian existence. In the hands of Haywood, it becomes a tool of defiance; with the help of their microscopes, the female spectators transform the small and insignificant into wonders. I propose that such transformation operates as an alle gory and vehicle for women's self-transformation. The female spectators repeatedly discover hidden cause for admiration in the humble and the small as they employ empirical methods of observation. Documenting an encounter with another variety of caterpillar, the Female Spectator observes: THERE are a Sort, who at first Sight appear more ugly than any of the rest:?They seem all of a dirty brown Colour, and are covered with Hair of the same Hue, which is long and coarse, like the Bristles of a Boar; but when you come to examine them, you will find Beauties you little expect ed:?That shaggy Coat, which is doubtless given them for a Protection, but hides from the naked Eye a Skin perfectly enameled with Gold and Purple:?They have Heads quite round, and exactly resembling a Globe of Amber, both for Clearness and Colour:?Their Eyes are wonderfully fine, whether we consider their Shape or Lustre, and that they have very sharp Teeth I experienced, by laying one of them upon the Back of my Hand, in order to examine it more carefully. (FS, 3:162) I have quoted this passage at length to demonstrate the voluminous quality of the Female Spectator's empirical documentations. In this passage, as in others like it, that which is small is depicted with an inordinate amount of text, demonstrating formally what the Female Spectator makes explicit with the content of her record: that the diminutive and insignificant are only superficially so. When observed rightly (i.e., philosophically), the trivial is far from trite. The caterpillars that the Female</page><page sequence="8">62 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 Spectator depicts here are not only small but also ugly. However, as she notes, "when you come to examine them, you will find Beauties you little expected"; their coat loses its "shagginess," becoming instead "perfectly enameled with Gold and Purple." They also assume a surprising amount of complexity and depth. Submit ted to careful attention, these tiny commonplace creatures shed their smallness and insignificance, transforming into magnificent beings. The female spectators thus perform with their microscopes magnifications both physical and conceptual. In fact, one might reasonably speculate that caterpillars recur throughout the discussions of natural philosophy Haywood presents because of how central metamorphosis is to her understanding of empirical practices. Of course, largely as a result of the advent and subsequent popularization of microscopy, wonders afforded by close encounters with the minute captivated many writers in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. The Female Spectator's older brother offers a memorable account of "extraordinary Degrees of Grandeur or Minuteness" in one of the papers he devotes to "The Pleasures of the Imagina tion."26 In 1757, Edmund Burke even claims that "the last extreme of littleness is in some measure sublime." Echoing Addison, he asserts that we cannot "distinguish in its effect . . . extreme littleness from the vast itself."27 Aesthetic theorists and natural philosophers alike "spun" "little World[s]" into "Universe[s]" throughout the eighteenth century.28 However, the attention it devotes to the gender implications of magnifi cation separates The Female Spectator from the aesthetic theories of Burke and Addison (or, in the empirical context, the microscopical writings of, say, Robert Hooke or Henry Baker). This is not to say that there are no gender implications inherent in the writings of Burke or Addison, Hooke or Baker; rather, I would sug gest that Haywood brings such implications to the surface in The Female Spectator, exploring the possibilities they present. Almost one hundred years earlier, Margaret Cavendish gestured toward the significance of magnification to gender construc tion in a pair of poems entitled "Of many Worlds in this World" and "A World in an Eare-Ring" (1653). The latter poem elaborates the former's conclusion, which consists of the following couplet: "And if thus small, then ladies may well wear/ A world of worlds, as pendents in each ear."29 Haywood elaborates, and pursues the potential of, such a diminutive and feminine "world of worlds." Like Philo-Naturse, Haywood accommodates natural philosophy to the traditional female station. The most overt illustration of this accommodation arises when she portrays the snails the female spectators collect for empirical study as a "young Nursery" (FS, 3:164). Yet through acts of magnification she also dem onstrates that empiricism has the capacity to redefine the female station.30 After having spent a few days observing their "Nursery" of snails, the female spectators are "convinced . . . that this Species of Insects, contemptible as it may seem, had in it sufficient to excite an Admiration of the alwise and beneficent Creator, who forgets not the smallest of his Works" (FS, 3:164). "But, methinks, I hear some People say," Haywood writes, "Could they find no Objects more worthy their Attention, than Caterpillars and Snails??Two Insects the most contemptible of any" Her response to this challenge is telling:</page><page sequence="9">Girten / Unsexed Souls 63 [N]othing made by God is in itself contemptible:?Wonderful are all his Works, and the Behemoth of the Land, or the Leviathan of the Sea, mag nify not his Power and Wisdom more by their Strength; nor the spotted Leopard of the Forest, or the fine Limbed Antelope, or the starry-plumed Peacock by their Comeliness and Beauty, than do these Insects, by the amazing Properties bestowed on each. (FS, 3:165) According to Haywood, all of God's creatures "magnify" the "power" of God; "amazing properties" have been "bestowed" upon them equally. Thus, snails and behemoths are equally admirable, and Haywood's feminization of nature's "con temptible" trivialities suggests that the same is true of women and men. Women, like caterpillars and snails, only seem inferior: small, mundane, even loathsome. In reality, Haywood indicates, they are no less than any of God's other creatures, whether behemoth, leviathan, leopard, antelope, "starry-plumed Peacock"?or even man. The female sphere may be infused with the trivial but loses its triviality as well as its inferiority when subjected to the magnifying lens of natural philosophy.31 In the hands of the Female Spectator, natural philosophy equalizes the masculine and the feminine, the male and the female, and thereby helps to promote women's self assertion. According to the transformative power of empiricism, fair philosophers should be seen not simply as helpmates but as peers of male virtuosi. Certain key aspects of England's new philosophy help justify Haywood's push for gender egalitarianism in the context of Baconian empiricism. For instance, though he might not have supported Haywood's gendered application, the found ing father of the new philosophy, Francis Bacon, would have fervently agreed with her claim that it is "often, by the most trifling Accidents, [that] very great and important Discoveries have been made" (FS, 3:169). He shares her conviction that what is perceived as trivial should be approached with great seriousness. In fact, in his New Organon (1620), he contends that "the greatest obstacle" to scientific progress is that "familiar things of frequent occurrence do not arrest and hold men's contemplation."32 As Bacon here attests, crucial to his method was a deep reflection on ("contemplation" of) those common and humble phenomena that typically escape one's notice. According to Bacon, mundane, mean, and diminutive objects offer particularly important opportunities for philosophical investigation. He explains: "As for mean or even foul objects for which (as Pliny says) we have to apologise,. . . just as the best perfumes are sometimes made from smelly things like musk and civet, so excellent light and information emerge from mean and dirty things."33 He therefore asks his reader to accept into this history, first, the commonest things which one might think it superfluous to put into writing because they are so familiar; then mean things, illiberal, disgusting . . . ; also, trivial, childish things . . . ; finally, things which seem to be excessively subtle, because they are of no use in themselves.34 For Bacon, the "common," "mean," and "trivial" offer special access to the secrets of nature?and acquire a certain "dignity" in doing so. He even asserts, alluding to Matthew 19:14, that "we must become again as children utterly"?immersing ourselves in the trifles of everyday existence?if we are to make progress in natural philosophy.35 As the ode Abraham Cowley provided to serve as a preface to Thomas Sprat's History of the Royal Society (1667) attests, from Bacon philosophers learned</page><page sequence="10">64 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 "to press/ Into the privatest recess/ Of [Nature's] imperceptible Littleness."36 In vestigations of the mundane, mean, and diminutive in fact provided the bedrock of England's new philosophy.37 The formal and historical connections between the new philosophy and the Christian tradition of meditation also lend authority to Haywood's gender egali tarianism. In fact, I would argue that the justification these connections provide is even more profound than that furnished by the prominence of the trivial in the new philosophy. Scholars have not yet fully explored or emphasized the connections between meditative and empirical practices in early modern Britain. Nevertheless, as Joanna Picciotto's article on the experimentalist underpinnings of Paradise Lost suggests, albeit somewhat tacitly, there is substantial evidence that meditative prac tice and philosophical practice were closely paralleled and possibly even mutually informing in early modern Britain.38 Robert Boyle's meditative treatise, Occasional Reflections upon Several Subjects (1665), offers an immediately obvious testament to this relationship. As Boyle himself announces, his Reflections faithfully adheres to the method of occasional meditation established by Bishop Joseph Hall's Occasional Meditations in 1630. However, as a meditation such as "Upon his distilling Spirit of Roses in a Limbick" illustrates, it also draws significantly on Boyle's training in Baconian empirical practice, suggesting a close connection between the two pursuits at the time.39 Formal similarities between works of meditation and those of philosophy help to confirm the closeness of this relationship. For instance, the titles Robert Hooke uses for the observations he provides in his Micrographia are nearly interchangeable with those that Hall employs in his Meditations. Compare Hooke's "Observ. XVI. Of Charcoal, or burnt Vegetables" with Hall's "XXXVII. Upon a Coal Covered with Ashes," or his "Observ. XXXVI. Of Peacoks [sic], Ducks, and other Feathers of changeable colours" with Hall's "LXXXIII. Upon the Sight and Noise of a Peacock."40 Haywood's portrayal of philosophic practices certainly supports this cor relation between meditation and empirical investigation. For her, they are close cousins, if not in fact the very same occupation.41 She repeatedly employs the term "meditation" and its synonyms, "contemplation" and "reflection," to signify Baco nian inquiry (FS, 2:359; 3, 163; 3:249; etc.). Furthermore, her empirical investiga tions very often lead to moments of insight and exaltation that are characteristic of the meditative practice propounded by the likes of Hall and Boyle, suggesting that Haywood has their meditative works (or others like them) in mind as she engages with natural philosophy. One such moment arises during the female spectators' encounter with various caterpillars. Observe the transition made here, through the vehicle of analogy, from empirical observation to a reflection on humanity, and then on God: The other Caterpillars . . . had a sort of Glue within their Bowels, by the Ejection of which they could, when any Danger of that Nature threat ened, fasten themselves so firmly to the Bark of a Tree, or any other Place they chose for an Asylum, that it was not in the Power of the roughest Blasts of Boreas to shake them off. Wherefore then ought not we, who pretend to Reason, to be content with the Station in which we are placed? . . . The alwise Creator has dispensed to every one a Sufficiency to make him happy, and it lies on us</page><page sequence="11">Girten / Unsexed Souls 65 alone to manage the Talents he has given, so as not to stand in need of more. (FS, 3:163) Such analogical progression from material details to a consideration of one's self, one's fellow humans, and the "alwise Creator" is a central feature of the occasional meditation. Hall's meditation "Upon Bees Fighting" provides an apt point of com parison: What a pity it is to see these profitable, industrious creatures fall so furiously upon each other and thus sting and kill each other in the very mouth of the hive! . . . There is no more perfect resemblance of a com monwealth, whether civil or sacred, than in an hive. . . . Oh God who are at once the Lord of Hosts and Prince of Peace [Gen. 32:2; Isa. 8:6], give us war with spiritual wickedness and peace with our brethren.42 Much like Haywood, Hall begins with empirical observations of a natural object (bees), proceeds by an analogy between this object and humanity to a reflection on a human experience (violence against fellow Christians), and then concludes with a consideration of humanity's relationship to God (the "Prince of Peace").43 Such similarities suggest that the Female Spectator's philosophic investigations are also simultaneously meditative acts of devotion, and thus offer a testament to the closeness of the two occupations. For Haywood, the practice of philosophy is ideally one whose benefits accrue to the soul: [T]rue Philosophy as well as Religion will shew us better Things. . . . Let us then devote some Part of our Time to Study and Meditation. When the Mind is worthily employed, says a great Author, the Body becomes spiritualized; but when we suffer a Lassitude to benumn our Faculties, the very Spirit degenerates into Matter. (FS, 3:33) Here, Haywood echoes advice Boyle offers in his Reflections "to spiritualize all the Objects and Accidents that occur" to one (OR, 80). Her use of coordination ("true Philosophy as well as Religion"; "Study and Meditation") suggests that philosophy ("study") is just as capable as meditation of effecting such "spiritualization," and that it should be called on to do so alongside, if not within, one's contemplative exercises. In both occupations, "the Mind" acts as a mediator between "the Body" and "Spirit." That philosophy is, according to Haywood, fundamentally a spiritual act offers substantial justification for her conviction that it enables women to trans form themselves from men's subordinates into their peers, because it implies that one's status as a philosopher is based on the status of one's soul or spirit. And, for Haywood at least, souls have no sex. She assumes this position somewhat furtively, perhaps because it was a controversial one at the time. A correspondent, Cleora, has just written in to bemoan the deficiencies that characterize contemporary female education, taking a definitive stance against the "sexed souls" argument: "There is, undoubtedly, no Sexes in Souls, and we are as able to receive and practice the Impressions, not only of Virtue and Religion, but also of those Sciences which the Men engross to themselves, as they can be." (FS, 2:355)</page><page sequence="12">66 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 Distinguishing between matter ("Clay") and spirit, this reader suggests that, though men's and women's bodies may be fundamentally different, their souls are funda mentally the same?"form'd by the great Creator out of the finest Mould."44 The "sexed souls" argument had substantial currency when The Female Spectator was published. Steele offers one of its most well-known articulations in The Tatler: I am sure, I do not mean it an injury to women, when I say there is a sort of sex in souls. I am tender of offending them, and know it is hard not to do it on this subject; but I must go on to say, that the soul of a man and that of a woman are made very unlike, according to the employments for which they are designed.45 It is against this line of thinking that Cleora protests. While Haywood never makes a definitive statement like Cleora's ("'There is, undoubtedly, no Sexes in Souls'"), her response indicates that she agrees with this statement. Commiserating with the dismay her correspondent expresses in response to women's domestic captivity, Haywood asserts, Those Men are certainly guilty of a great deal of Injustice who think, that all the Learning becoming in a Woman is confined to the Management of her Family; that is, to give Orders concerning the Table, take care of her Children in their Infancy, and observe that her Servants do not neglect their Business. (FS, 2:356) Haywood here, as elsewhere in The Female Spectator, attests that women's abili ties are far greater than typically perceived. As she does so, she implicitly supports Cleora's claim that men's and women's souls are the same, for it is such sameness that legitimates Cleora's (and therefore, by association, the Female Spectator's) argument that women deserve greater educational opportunities. What Haywood perceives as the contemplative or spiritual aspect of natural philosophy helps to authorize her use of it as a vehicle for women to challenge their supposed inferiority to men, expressing a fundamental sameness and equality?that of the spirit. The tradition of occasional meditation provided a context in which men and women could experience God and nature on equal terms. Robert Boyle addresses his Occasional Reflections to his sister and, at various points, appeals to a diverse audience: "the Learned and the Devout; both Gentlemen, and Ladies; and, in a word, Inquisitive Persons of several Kinds and Conditions" (OR, preface). He regularly invites his readers to meditate alongside him; in fact, it is supposedly with the goal of encouraging them to engage in their own meditations?and thus provide him "Company"?that he publishes his collection. As he offers such en couragement, he conveys an egalitarian understanding of the occasional meditation, suggesting that it is practice, and practice alone, that makes one meditator capable of "surpassing" another (OR, preface). Informed by her sense of philosophy as a contemplative pursuit, Haywood extends the egalitarianism of the tradition of occasional meditation to natural philosophy. That Haywood perceives natural philosophy as a means by which women may assert themselves, pressing beyond what typically is expected of them, is con firmed by the fact that she herself employs it thus. The example the Female Spectator</page><page sequence="13">Girten / Unsexed Souls 67 provides through her own philosophic practice confirms that Philo-Naturae's "fair Columbus" fantasy is well-founded. The Female Spectator embodies this fantasy in an imagined interaction with one of the gentlemen who have taken it upon themselves to guide her group's rural exercises: The worthy Gentleman, I before mentioned, and who is a great Con templator of the minute Works of Nature, told us, that this Species of the Caterpillars is of the Camelion kind, and changes its Hue according to the Weather:?If we had continued in the Country a little longer, I would certainly have made the Experiment, by keeping one of them in a Box, with some Earth, and the same Sort of Leaves on which I found it feeding; for though I am willing to pay a due Deference to the Judgment of that Gentleman, I am rather apt to believe the Colour of these Animals more owing to their Food than to the Air they breathe. (F5, 3:162) Though this interaction is only proposed, it nevertheless demonstrates that the Female Spectator experiences a remarkably profound sense of self-confidence and authority in the context of?and I would argue as a result of?her philosophic practice. Here, as elsewhere in her narrative of her visit to the country, she expresses "Deference to the Judgment" of a male virtuoso. However, such deference is belied by her unwillingness to be convinced by this "worthy Gentleman's" "Judgment."46 Drawing on her past empirical experiences while also proposing future experimenta tion, she feels perfectly capable of taking a discordant view of "this Species of the Caterpillars." The submissive tone that the Female Spectator adopts threatens to obscure her philosophic boldness, yet it is clear from what she says here that her deference only goes so far. This passage demonstrates that the Female Spectator feels qualified not only to discourse with men but also to disagree with them on subjects of natural philosophy. Another illustration of the Female Spectator's philosophic boldness arises during her expression of support for the theory of the "Plurality of Worlds." This theory was, as Haywood indicates, a source of controversy at the time of The Fe male Spectator's publication. She first introduces it while narrating the telescopic investigations that the female spectators perform during their rural retreat. There is a lack of agreement on the topic among their gentlemen guides: "[T]hree of them were strongly for that System, and the fourth, who was of a contrary Opinion, had a very difficult Task to find Arguments which seemed of any Weight" (FS, 3:171). The Female Spectator proceeds to portray the rationales provided on both sides of the debate. As she does so, she demonstrates an obvious preference for the argu ments offered as evidence for the theory ("System"), insisting that the gentleman who speaks on its behalf does so "with a good deal of Reason" (FS, 3:171). Haywood returns to the controversy in a subsequent issue, prompted by a letter from Philo-Naturse in which he speaks in favor of the theory. The Female Spectator responds to Philo-Naturse as follows: [0]ur Society are, above all, charmed with the convincing Defence he has made of an Opinion some Zealots and Enthusiasts so much cry down, and endeavour to explode as unchristian and fabulous: I mean that of Plurality of Worlds, which I never yet could hear any one good Reason to condemn. (FS, 3:243)</page><page sequence="14">68 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 Both here and, albeit less overtly, during her account of the gentlemen's debate on the topic, the Female Spectator shows a willingness to make up her own mind on a much-disputed philosophic topic. Rather than remaining neutral on the subject, as a proper "deference" to male virtuosi would require, she takes a definitive stance in support of the Plurality of Worlds. Informed by her "Reason" as well as "the Testimony of [her] own Eyes," she firmly disagrees with the gentleman philosophers who reject the theory, even labeling them "Zealots and Enthusiasts" (FS, 3:171). Here, as in her discussion of caterpillars, the Female Spectator asserts her capacity to philosophize on an equal footing with men. From its inception, the new philosophy was portrayed as a collaborative enterprise. "The materials for the understanding," according to Bacon, "are so widely scattered that we need to have agents and merchants (so to speak) seeking and collecting them from every corner."47 In actuality, the Royal Society was a fairly exclusive society. Not only were women prevented from joining; as Steven Shapin has demonstrated, members tended to be of a certain social class.48 However, it was commonly believed that, if the truth claims produced by the new philosophy were to be well-founded, they had to be informed by a wide range of empirical testimony. Consequently, the Society felt compelled to invite contributions from a broad spec trum of contributors. Sprat explains that it "embracfes] all assistance": All Places and Corners are now busie and warm about this Work; and we find many noble Rarities to be every Day given in not only by the Hands of learned and profess'd Philosophers: but from the Shops of Mechanicks; from the Voyages of Merchants; from the Ploughs of Husbandmen; from the Sports, the Fish-ponds, the Parks, the Gardens of Gentlemen.49 This passage demonstrates: 1) that disinterestedness was a central goal of the new philosophy, and 2) that it was achieved by inviting wide participation (or, at least, appearing to do so).50 Even at his most inclusive, Sprat excludes women from philosophical pursuits; however, Haywood demonstrates that the inclusivity of which the Royal Society boasted easily could, and should, be extended along gender lines. So confident is Haywood in women's philosophic capabilities that she even poses an implicit challenge to the difference Philo-Naturas maintains between philosophy that is appropriate for women and that which is not. As we have seen, Philo-Naturse bases this division on a difference between philosophy that is em pirical in nature and the allegedly more demanding variety practiced by the likes of Newton and Malebranche. In a later issue, Haywood reveals these differences to be superficial, if not illusory. Focusing specifically on Newton's theory of grav ity, she argues that abstract philosophy is directly inspired by, firmly rooted in, and therefore inseparable from empiricism. "The justly celebrated and learned Sir Isaac Newton," the Female Spectator asserts, "took his first Hint of Gravitation from seeing an Apple fall from a Tree" (FS, 3:169). Though the Female Spectator repeatedly proclaims her approval of the input Philo-Naturas offers, this is quite a different portrayal of Newton from that which he provides. Philo-Naturse highlights the theoretical dimension of Newton's philosophical practice; Haywood emphasizes its empirical foundation. Like Philo-Naturse, Haywood depicts Newton as a "great Man." However, whereas he characterizes Newtonian philosophy as at a remove</page><page sequence="15">Girten / Unsexed Souls 69 from those who lack the "capacity" to devote themselves fully to studying it, she sees it as derived from everyday life. An important consequence of Haywood's characterization is that Newto nian philosophy appears substantially more accessible than it does in Philo-Naturae's depiction of it. In this sense, Haywood's portrayal closely corresponds to the numerous contemporary works that were designed to make Newton available to a wide (and often female) audience, the most prominent of which is bluestocking Elizabeth Carter's 1739 translation of Francesco Algarotti's Newtonianismo Per le Dame.51 According to the particular logic of Haywood's portrayal, if Newtonian philosophy is based on empirical observation of quotidian existence, then there is no reason why the type of philosophic practice that Philo-Naturae deems appropri ate for women cannot serve as a gateway to it, in spite of its distinctively empirical nature. Here, Haywood once again challenges gender difference and hierarchy by depicting that which is trivial (an apple falling from a tree?the feminine empiri cal) being transformed into something of great significance (gravity?the masculine abstract). Lynette Hunter and Sarah Hutton document "the separation of [. . . em pirical] knowledge from its embeddedness in everyday domestic life to a production system of knowledge set culturally apart."52 The Female Spectator suggests that, by 1744, this knowledge had been sufficiently detached from the female domain so as to be eligible for conscious and strategic reinscription within it. The history that Hunter and Hutton acknowledge bolsters the reinscription that Haywood enacts?of knowledge within the private and the everyday, of the abstract within the empirical. Promoted and practiced by the Female Spectator, philosophy truly approaches,?quoting the verse in this essay's epigraph?"An universal Good." The transformative power of the new philosophy, along with its collaborative meth odology, help support Haywood's egalitarian portrayal of empirical practice. Her understanding of empiricism as closely identified with the practice of meditation confirms her portrayal's legitimacy, for this identification implicitly eradicates any notions of intrinsic differences and disparities between philosophy as practiced by women and that practiced by men. It is widely acknowledged that natural philosophy became a relatively popular and even fashionable pastime for women in the eighteenth century. As this essay has shown, The Female Spectator offers insight into what was potentially at stake in women's philosophic practice and what possibilities it may have presented. It is true that some women viewed natural philosophy as simply an innocent en tertainment, easily pursued from within the confines of the conventional female station. For such women, philosophic endeavors were merely an extension of their traditional female role. Haywood presents natural philosophy in this light, yet she also attributes much more to it. According to The Female Spectator, empirical practices provide women with a context in which to investigate and contemplate alongside men, thus claiming what is, on account of their souls' equal status, their rightful position. Susan Staves identifies Haywood's Female Spectator with a widespread "shift to acceptability" that she purports to have occurred in British women's writ ing between 1737 and 1756.53 As she does so, she upholds the now familiar, albeit contested, impression that the latter part of Haywood's career enacted a transition</page><page sequence="16">70 Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 43, No. 1 from "romance and scandal" to moralistic writing "designed to be less provoking and easier to accept."54 However, Staves neglects to consider the way in which moral writings by women may themselves be provoking, particularly as they have recourse to the greatness of women's souls. The issues of The Female Spectator I have discussed here pose a direct challenge to Staves's conclusion that "in this period most women writers [including Haywood] reinforce the idea that God and nature created women as different from men, more tender, weaker, properly sub ordinated to men and dependent upon male admiration and male protection."55 In fact, in its discussion of natural philosophy, The Female Spectator offers substantial evidence to the contrary. Other texts by women from the same period are even more overt in their challenge to gender disparity. The pseudonymous writings by Sophia from 1740 cited above advertise the challenge they pose in their titles. Sylviana Sola presents a similarly bold challenge when, in her 1752 collection Various Essays, she observes, "The Soul, and its Faculties, are not of any Sex."56 Sophia, Sola, and Haywood maintain views of women's capabilities strikingly similar to those portrayed decades earlier by Mary Astell, who repeatedly cites the wonder of women's souls as evidence of their intellectual aptitude.57 Thus, their mid-century works caution us neither to over-emphasize nor too broadly generalize the submissiveness that might seem, at least superficially, to characterize a number of works by women from the period. Researchers into women's mid-eighteenth-century writings would do well to culti vate a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between performed feminine deference and the persistence of the belief in the fundamental gender-neutrality of the soul.58 At least for some, such gender neutrality continued at mid-century to authorize women to pursue what Mary Chudleigh might characterize as "masculine pleasures"?those posing a challenge to concepts of gender propriety.

Thus, it is the circumstances of their lives, not their minds, that make women "'unsuited'" for "'the Ideas of great Men.'" However, he nevertheless dissuades women from engaging in "'arduous Labour of the Brain,'" apparently motivated by a fear of male resentment: '"I shall find little Forgiveness from my own Sex to persuade those Enliveners of Society to any thing which would deprive us of their Company for any long Time'" (FS, 3:83). 16.

This effect becomes even more apparent when, in her response to Philo-Naturse's second letter, Haywood demonstrates the capacity of natural philosophy to make wonders out of feminine "Orna ments." Transformed by philosophy from baubles pleasing to the eye and nose into engines of religious instruction and devotion, the flowers women use to decorate their "Bosoms," "Hair," "Pots," and "China Basons" become truly valuable, and therefore worthy of serious consideration. One must as sume that so, too, do the women who wear them for, as Haywood acknowledges, women are so closely identified with the trivialities they employ to decorate themselves and their environs that it is impossible to separate them from one another (FS, 3:245-250). 32.

Shawn Lisa Maurer's reading of The Female Spectator observes that such expressions of defer ence to male authority recur throughout the periodical, but also highlights the way in which Haywood simultaneously "claim[s] an impartial moral authority" for herself, thereby casting herself and her periodical in a masculine guise. I agree with Maurer that Haywood's oscillation between feminine deference and masculine authority illuminates a profound interconnectedness of the public and private, the male and female. However, I do not believe that Maurer goes far enough in her assessment of the effect of this oscillation and the figurative transvestism it entails. Maurer maintains that Haywood's periodical only "pushjes] at the boundaries" of the female domain without "reconfiguring] them"?that it "confine[s]" women "to a subset of the universal sphere designated male." In contrast, I argue here that to push at the boundaries of the female domain to the extent that Haywood does in The Female Spectator is necessarily to reconfigure them, as well as those of the male sphere.

Patri cia Springborg (London: Pickering &amp;c Chatto, 1997); and Some Reflections upon Marriage, in Astell, Political Writings, ed. Patricia Springborg (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

A number of essays address Astell's engagement with the soul in William Kolbrener and Michal Michelson, eds., Mary Astell: Reason, Gender, Faith (Aldershot, UK: Ashgate, 2007). 58. Eve Tavor Bannet and Clare Brant both deserve our appreciation for remaining sensitive to various continuities inherent in women's writings across the century, though neither discusses the debate surrounding the sex of souls in much detail. See Bannet, The Domestic Revolution: Enlighten ment Feminisms and the Novel (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2000); and Brant, "Varieties of Women's Writing," in Women and Literature in Britain, 1700-1800, ed. Vivien Jones (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000), 285-305.</page></plain_text>
