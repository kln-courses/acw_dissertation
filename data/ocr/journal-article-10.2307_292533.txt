<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROLE OF THE BOW IN THE PHILOCTETES OF SOPHOCLES. Perhaps no play of Sophocles has received more attention from recent critics or been more violently distorted by them than the Philoctetes. The great difficulty of the play is found in the reversal of decision which Heracles as deus ex machina orders and which is accepted so readily by the previously adamant Philoctetes. Kitto remarks that Heracles "so badly needs some- thing exciting to say," and rejecting his own earlier treatment Kitto concludes that Sophocles here "superimposes an ideal ending on the real one, in such a way that the one does not annul or even obscure the other, but each retains its own validi- ty."' 1Linforth, too, is very sympathetic with Philoctetes' point of view and concludes: "The wound in his foot can be healed, but the wound in his soul is beyond cure."2 Kirkwood thinks that Neoptolemus is transformed "to complete sympathy with the uncompromising virtue of Philoctetes."3 No! Both the wound in the body and the wound in the soul must be cured, and it is only when they are cured that we can speak without qualification of the virtue of Philoctetes, for virtue depends on rational choice. Philoctetes' determination to sacrifice health and glory to vengeance is irrational and per- verse. Neoptolemus, it is true, comes to pity Philoctetes, but he never thinks that Philoctetes has made the correct choice. There can be no dichotomy, furthermore, between the ideal and 1 Kitto, Form and Meaning in Drama (London, 1956), pp. 133, 137. M. Imhof in his review of this book (Gnomon, XXIX [1957], p. 591) views this treatment of the Philoctetes "zwiespMltig und misslungen." Cf. S. M. Adams, who says of Philoctetes' refusal: "This is an adequate answer, on the human plane." "The typical Sophoclean cen- tral figure has kept his strong determination; only the direct command of heaven overcomes it with the overriding claim of piety" (Sophocles the Playwright, Phoenix, Supplement III [Toronto, 1957], pp. 158, 159). 2 Ivan M.

Especially for the Greeks, the divine is an extension of the human. The real or human solution must coincide with the ideal or divine one-and it does! The Philoctetes of Euripides, produced in 431 B.C., seems to have presented a stirring dramatic conflict finally resolved in favor of patriotism.4 His Philoctetes seems to have been persuaded by ordinary human argument.5 It is not likely that Euripides' argumentation could have been greatly improved upon. Sophocles, therefore, must invent a different ending. The Philoctetes of Sophocles was produced at an even more crucial hour for Athens, and the issues here presented remind one immediately of Thucydides' famous description of the de- terioration of character during the war (III, 82-3 Crawley): "Revenge ... was held of more account than self-preservation." ". . . success by treachery won . . . the palm of superior intel- ligence." "The ancient simplicity into which honor so largely entered was laughed down and disappeared. .. ." Here in these descriptions stand Philoctetes, Odysseus, and Neoptolemus, and, in general, the whole fearfully complex problem of the priority of obligations, never more crucial than at Athens in 409 B. C. Sophocles is certainly concerned with the portrayal of the char- acters of these three men, but of course he is much more pro- foundly concerned with the political and moral problems involved. Sophocles has shown no sympathy whatever for the unprin- cipled politician Odysseus. This is obvious throughout the play but especially in the first scene where Odysseus uses so many offensive words (ao'to-a, iKKXEiets, KkXore?v, Ica=a). Odysseus is depicted as politicians are and always will be. In fairness Sophocles might have allowed him more explicitly to say that honesty survives only when one's antagonist shows some respect for it. Odysseus may claim to serve the purpose of Zeus (Phil. 990), but he is painted in such black colors that he cannot 4 Evidence on the development and ending of Euripides' play is very slight. The assumptions that I have made seem to me plausible, but of course they cannot be proved correct. On the three plays in general, and especially on the ending of Euripides' play, see John S. Kieffer, "Philoctetes and Arete," C.P., XXXVII (1942), pp. 38-50. 5 See Apollodorus, Epitome, V, 8; Dio Chrysostom, Or., 52.</page><page sequence="3">PHILIP WHALEY HARSH. represent any divinity for whom Sophocles had genuine respect. The reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the Philoctetes is not that the gods choose strange helpmates but rather that such unscrupulous leaders, even when they adopt a just cause, retard rather than advance the interests of society.6 For Philoctetes Sophocles certainly shows a most kindly sym- pathy, and the great appeal of the play is in no small measure due to this. But no Greek spectator could have approved of Philoctetes' rugged refusal of engagement, a refusal which so enthralls modern critics-and Andre Gide. The Greek spectator must immediately have thought of Achilles in the Iliad and especially of the great and deliberately verbose speech by which Nestor fires Patroclus to action while Achilles stands inactive and sees his friends die. Sophocles has made this analogy un- mistakable by having Philoctetes lay the blame for his plight not upon the Greeks-his attitude towards Greeks in general is friendly-but specifically and time and time again upon the Atreidae and Odysseus.7 The continual repetition of this point must be significant in the play. Philoctetes' complaint, like that of Achilles, is one against individuals. We know very clearly from the character of Odysseus in the Ajax where Sophocles stands when patriotism combines with enlightened self-interest against the feuding of individuals. Sophocles did not approve of Philoctetes' decision. Sophocles obviously, then, views the individual as the prime and determinant element of the state. Indeed no one has ever cham- pioned the inalienable rights and dignity of the individual more eloquently. Still, the individual is viewed as an element of a larger whole and not as an independent creation: he cannot renounce his obligations to his fellow men however grossly mis- treated he may have been. Besides this evidence from the Iliad and the Ajax, there is definite indication in the play itself that the stubborn refusal of Philoctetes to accept the embassy of Neoptolemus is not virtuous. This embassy, of course, would have been much more appealing 6 Some critics think otherwise. Georges Meautis (Sophocle: Essai sur le h6ros tragique [Paris, 1957], p. 97) states: ". . . Ulysse, les Atrides ont ete les instruments inconscients d'une volunte plus haute." 7 Phil. 264, 314, 406, 791ff., 872, 1023, 1285-6, 1356-7, 1384, 1390, cf. 321, 361, 372, 389, 585-6. 410</page><page sequence="4">THE ROLE OF THE BOW IN THE "PHILOCTETES." 411 to Philoctetes if Odysseus had not been sent. But Sophocles retains Odysseus, desiring to present " les trois morales" in their most powerful forms and to force his three characters to their utmost extremes. Thus he gives Philoctetes' case its strongest conceivable support. Even so, the chorus tell Philoctetes that he has made the wrong choice and that he alone will be respon- sible for his fate (1095-1100). Neoptolemus, too, insists that Philoctetes has become wild (7yp(worat 1321) and is refusing the proffered favors of the gods (1374). Neoptolemus finally agrees to take Philoctetes home not because he thinks this the right course, but merely because he is pressed so hard on a point of personal honor. There is other and even stronger evidence, usually overlooked by modern critics,8 who have normally found only three morales in the play. Actually there is a fourth, more powerful than any of the others: the bow of Heracles. This bow is the conspicuous center of attention from the first entrance of Philoctetes. It is the objective symbol of Heracles. And who is this god? This is the type of question which Grube asked in his brilliant study of the Bacchae, and his eloquent answer solved the riddle.9 It is a question which we must always ask when a god appears in Greek tragedy. Who is Heracles? The answer was obvious to every Greek spectator and is obvious to us. Suffice it here to cite the para- basis of the Wasps (1043) where Aristophanes boasts of being the Heraclean champion who attacked the horrid monster of the Pnyx: Toov8' e,povY7es aXECKacKOv Tv x7j pa, TcrSe iKaapTr7v.'? In the Peace Aristophanes repeats this boast and adds that he deserves gratitude for freeing the Athenian state of such tyranny. 8 Gilbert Norwood (Greek Tragedy2 [London, 1928], pp. 164-5) is a notable exception, pointing out that the bow of Heracles is the rightful instrument of well-doing and that it was for such a reason that Philoctetes received it. See also Cedric H. Whitman, Sophocles: a Study of Heroic Humanism (Cambridge, Mass., 1951), p. 182. G. M. A. Grube, "Dionysus in the Bacchae, T. A.P. A., LXVI (1935), pp. 53-4. 1o Note the epithet dXeicLKaKco, a frequent epithet of Heracles, as of Apollo (and other gods). On Heracles in general, see Marcel Simon, Hercule et le Christianisme (Paris, 1955), p. 108.</page><page sequence="5">PHILIP WHALEY HARSH. He boasts also that he is the champion of the theater who has made comedy safe from braggart gluttons and whining slaves. Heracles made civilization possible by achieving man's mastery over the beast and civilized man's superiority over the barbarian. He freed Prometheus, father of the arts, he slew the centaurs, wild monsters who refused their birthright to become men. His most magnificent weapon in all this was the bow, divine in its origin. This bow, Apollo's gift to Heracles, symbolizes man's intelligence brought into action to guarantee man's domination of the earth. This significance accounts for the prominence of the bow in the action and in the text of the Philoctetes. Forms of the word ro$ov/a occur some twenty-four times in the text, and there are numerous occurrences of oXrAa, Io, /eAoo. The imagery of archery, too, occurs, especially "to miss the mark" (aluaprravw, ea/!apTavM).ll The divine nature of the weapons is brought out repeatedly. The bow plays a major role in the dramatic action, and at the first production it must have been obvious that Philoctetes' present use of this magnificent weapon is a little ridiculous: the weapon of cultured man is here being used on a desert island to shoot "small fry" for one poor individual disabled in soli- tude and destined-inevitably-to be whole only when he again becomes an active participant in society. The use to which Phi- loctetes proposes to devote the bow near the end of the play- the slaying of the Greeks who may seek to punish him and Neoptolemus for their sulking-this use must have appeared to the original audience as nothing short of an outrageous reversal of the proper use of Apollo's gift to Heracles Sia rrqv apErEv12 and Heracles' gift to Philoctetes for "noble deeds," that is, for doing what must be done when others refuse to act.13 Heracles is something more than the champion of civilized society. A Stoic long before Zeno, he is a deification of engage- ment. If his simple but splendid lines at the end of the play do not excite us, then we have lost even from our imagination the thrill of heroic ambition and accomplishment.14 Heracles' speech 1Phil. 231, 1249; 95, 1012, 1224. 12 Diodorus Siculus, IV, 14, 3. 13 Sophocles, Phil. 670. 14 Kitto, op. cit., p. 105, says: "Nowhere in the whole of Sophocles is there a speech less impressive than this one which he wrote for Heracles." 412</page><page sequence="6">THE ROLE OF THE BOW IN THE "PHILOCTETES." 413 opens on the note of labor (reinforced by figura etymologica 1419), he cites his arete and challenges Philoctetes to great accomplishment through similar labor and by means of the bow (1427, 1432, 1440). Hope of victory was not dead at Athens in 409 B. C., and every intelligent Athenian knew that victory depended on ranking patriotism above-far above-parties and personal grievances. What Alcibiades had done and what had been done to him constituted an unmistakable example.15 What is needed to convert the uncompromising Philoctetes of Sophocles is the same thing that is needed in the Iliad to con- vert Achilles: a profoundly moving emotional experience. In reference to Achilles' accepting ransom for the body of Hector, Cedric Whitman in his brilliant treatment of Achilles remarks: "In only two lines, with no argument whatsoever, Achilles gives up the whole thing."'6 And again: "The god in such scenes is the clear moment of insight and decision. .. .17 Somewhat similar is Kitto's view of Sophocles' conception of the gods: "They symbolise his conception of an unchanging framework of Law which permeates human life as it does the physical uni- verse...." 18 It is true that earlier in the Philoctetes (1326) Neoptolemus says that the sufferings of the hero were all in accordance with divine plan. But this type of consolation is common in every age and is here no sound evidence that Sophocles believed in any supernatural direction of man's life. Indeed the Greek words here are vague (EcK Oedat rvx,-) and need hardly mean more than what has actually happened. In general the characters of Sophocles exhibit the bewilderingly varied be- liefs found in the Greek life of which he wrote. Sophocles' pro- found lack of prejudice on matters divine is one of the reasons for his eternal appeal. 1' Cf. Thucydides, VI, 89-92. 16 Cedric H.

Kirkwood (op. cit., p. 275) in reference to Ajax points out that Athena is just as ready to be cruel to her supposed favorite Odysseus. "To both men she is stern and impersonal." It follows, in the opinion of the present writer, that this Athena is in- exorable and no longer an anthropomorphic divinity.</page><page sequence="7">414 PHILIP WHALEY HARSH. The appearance of Heracles in this play is abrupt, but the reasoning behind his words is entirely rational and convincing, and his epiphany, interpreted symbolically like Athena's charge to Achilles in the first book of the Iliad or interpreted super- naturally, is of sufficient impressiveness to preclude further argument. The final lines of Philoctetes indicate that his con- version is perfect. The wound in his heart is completely healed. The bow of Heracles, then, is the fourth morale in the play, an objective and unchanging symbol against which the three vacillating human figures are constantly being measured through- out the play. None of these human figures meets its heroic standard until both Philoctetes and Neoptolemus consciously and deliberately do so at the appearance of its master. But from the beginning of the play we should realize that in any satisfactory solution these men must measure up to the ideals symbolized by the bow. t PHILIP WHALEY HAESH.</page></plain_text>
