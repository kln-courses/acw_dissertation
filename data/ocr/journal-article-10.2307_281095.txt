<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Reviewed by Gordon Bronitsky, University of New Mexico. This comprehensive, well-organized review is divid- ed into seven sections: a thorough, brief review of the natural environment, a critical assessment of previous research, a synopsis of prehistory, site descriptions, previous stabilization attempts, ethnographic obser- vations, and recommendations. Especially interesting are the criticisms of stabilization efforts and the criti- cisms of widely held beliefs about links between Ka- yenta Anasazi and ethnographic Hopi. Les Mayas. CLAUDE-FRANCOIS BAUDEZ and PIERRE BECQUELIN. L'univers des formes, Le Monde Precolumbien serie, Gallimard, 1984. xiv + 409 pp., illustrations, maps, biblio. Cloth. Reviewed by Prudence M. Rice, University of Florida. Lush and sumptuous may not be the only words to describe Les Mayas, but they certainly are among the most apropos. One of a series of three lavishly illus- trated volumes on "Le Monde Precolumbien" (the oth- er two treat Central Mexico and the Andes), Les Mayas is more than just another bit of coffee-table fluff. Be- sides superb color and black-and-white photographs (of remarkable quality, revealing details of surface tex- ture and technique in stone, jade, and pottery), the volume features a highly informative text, abundant line drawings of building complexes, site maps, recon- structions, and an illustrated glossary-index of art mo- tifs, gods, and Maya place names. The textual material begins with several introductory chapters on the Maya civilization and the genesis of Maya art. As one might expect, the focus of the book is on what the authors call "l'Apog&amp;e," or Late Classic period, A.D. 550-950, with about 175 pages of text and photographs devoted to the various media of expression of the Maya civilization in this period. Ar- chitecture and sculpture are addressed for each of the major subregions of the Maya area and then within these regions, separate treatments are given for indi- vidual sites, such as Tikal, Palenque, Copan, etc.; the other topical subdivisions are ceramics (vases, censers, and figurines) and portable art (jade, other stone, and shell). Following the section on the Classic period, shorter chapters treat the Puuc area, the "Maya-Tol- tec" Early Postclassic period, and the Late Postclassic. There is little here that is new: many of the photo- graphs that commonly illustrate books on Maya art and archaeology are included in Les Mayas, and as usual the emphasis is on the Lowlands and on the Classic period. It is refreshing, however, to have a book about Maya art and architecture written by archaeol- ogists, so that there is less stress on the emotional im- pact of the art and more on its cultural significance. Furthermore, authors Baudez's and Becquelin's ex- periences are primarily in the southern and peripheral Maya areas (Highlands, Chiapas, and Southeast pe- riphery) so that these frequently slighted regions are given a bit more attention than is the typical practice.

Reviewed by Joseph Mountjoy, University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Agrinier's monograph is a superbly illustrated report on investigations conducted in 1973-1975 at a location 100 km from the Pacific Coast. Research focused on the nature and extent of Early Olmec (San Lorenzo phase) deposits. Three discrete artifact concentrations were tested. Two, on the south side of the river 100 m apart, appear to be habitation areas. Excavations un- covered sherd refuse and some stone artifacts, plus one drilled piece of iron ore. The third area, located across the river and 1 km from the other two, has thousands of pieces of iron ore of unknown but non-local source, and a few Early Olmec sherds. Agrinier suggests that these sites indicate colonization by people from the San Lorenzo area who farmed and manufactured items of iron ore for export. He does not explain why these people would work iron ore at such a distance from their village. McDonald's publication is a concise and well-illus- trated report on his 1971 investigation of a 25-mound Olmec site located 12 km from the Pacific Coast in extreme southwestern Chiapas. Thirty-nine units, mostly 2-m pits, were excavated. Some of these ex- posed decorated stone monuments were in their orig- inal context; most notable were the jaguar and serpent head blocks flanking the base of a stairway, and two stela-like monuments with anthropomorphic designs flanking an altar next to a tomb of stone slabs. These monuments appear to date within the last 350 years of the cultural sequence at the site, radiocarbon dated (and recalibrated) to between 1100 B.C. and 300 B.C. Hopkins's memoir derives from fieldwork in 1968- 1970. It is a study of agricultural intensification and population from pre-Hispanic times to the present in an area marginal to nuclear cultural developments. Ethnohistorical and archaeological data are utilized to analyze cultural processes that are proposed to be ap- plicable to Mesoamerican civilization in general. The ethnohistoric sections admirably document the inter- play between economic geography and population trends.
