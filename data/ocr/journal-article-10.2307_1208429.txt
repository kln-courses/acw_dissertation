<plain_text><page sequence="1">POSTMODERNISM FROM A TO Z* A to Z because "Authors and Critics of Postmodern Fiction," the second and longer of the two parts that make up Larry McCaffery's bio-bibliographical guide, consists of 106 entries on individual writers running alphabetically from Walter Abish to Roger Zelazny. Most of those who choose to consult this volume will probably have read some- thing by Abish; few, I imagine, will have heard of Zelazny, though I may be wrong about this, and there may be more science fiction buffs among students of postmodernism than I suspect. At any rate, it is certainly the case that those who read or refer to the volume will come upon a variety of unfamiliar names. The point is worth stressing since it provides the most important clue to the editorial principles that govern Postmodern Fiction: A Bio-Bibliographical Guide, which are, by design, catholic, democratic, and inclusive. In his introduction, for example, McCaffery speaks of "the increasing attention being paid by serious, highly sophisticated authors to paraliterary forms such as science fiction and detective fiction" and of the need for them "to be examined more thoroughly by scholars" (xvii). The amplitude of McCaffery's list certainly suggests an intention, if not to destroy the notion of a canon, then to open the canon up, to make it receptive to writers and forms traditionally considered marginal or extraliterary; and he has achieved his goal with remarkable success. To be sure, every reader is likely to quarrel about exclusions (my own prime candidates are Grace Paley and T. Coraghessan Boyle) and inclusions (I have dif- ficulty, about which more later, with the appearance of such figures *Larry McCaffery, ed., Postmodern Fiction: A Bio-Bibliographical Guide.

It is obviously impossible here to do justice to the dozens of writers of individual entries. What can be said is that the bio-bibliographical accounts are almost uniformly intelligent, informative, fair-minded, discriminating, and enthusiastic - a feat all the more to be admired given the fact that each discussion averages only about three pages and manages to include in that brief space description, criticism and evaluation, some biographical information, and lists of primary as well as (usually) secondary sources. In short, readers will find them- selves extremely well served by the reference section of the volume, and, considering how much is packed into every essay, one probably shouldn't be surprised that comparatively little is said in these entries about postmodernism itself. There are, of course, exceptions - among others, James Knowlton's essay on Peter Handke, G. B. Crump's on R. M. Koster, Thomas LeClair's on Joseph McElroy-but it is true nevertheless that the term often becomes simply a way of suggesting that there is something experimental in or distinctive about the work of this or that writer. I should say that in noting this I mean to express sympathy rather than criticism. McCaffery, early on, disclaims any "attempt to create a single sharply delineated definition of post- modernism that will, once-and-for-all, explain the meaning of this mys- terious term" (xi), and obviously he is right. Long scorned and rejected, the word postmodern has recently been so pushed, pulled, stretched, and distended that it makes little sense at this point to nail down what- ever meaning or meanings it will presumably come in time to have. Still, if some of the critics in this part of the book find the notion of postmodernism intractably elusive; if others, sensibly, recognize that the authors they write about have only one foot in the postmodern camp; and if, finally, there are those who, in the wake of modernism's putative collapse, find in the word hardly more than a convenient term of approbation, it is nonetheless true that certain common themes, concerns, and emphases emerge from the volume as a whole and, most especially, from the fifteen "Overview Articles," which, along with the editor's introduction, occupy the other half of the guide. (One should note too the helpful bibliography of postmodern criticism with which the volume ends.) Like his editorial principles, McCaffery's intro- ductory essay is generous and tolerant: a sensible, commonsensical, 134 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">and imaginative survey of the nature and history of postmodernism that sets a high standard for his contributors to match. Since, as he plausibly argues, "there is no sharp demarcation line separating modernism and postmodernism" (xiv), his account begins with a con- sideration of "Some Precursors [Beckett, Borges, Nabokov, and others] and Background [philosophy, science, painting, Vietnam, and so on]" and moves from there to what he calls "The Postmodern Awakening: 1960-1975," in which, as "an extension of a larger sense of dissatis- faction and frustration" (xx), one finds a general sense that fiction needed to acknowledge its own artificial, con- structed nature, to focus the reader's attention on how the work was being articulated rather than merely on what was happening. Distrustful of all claims to truth and hypersensitive to the view that reality and objectivity were not givens but social or linguistic constructs, postmodern writers tended to lay bare the artifice of their works, to comment on the processes involved, to refuse the realist illusion that the work mimics operations outside itself ... Hardly a translucent window on to an object (the world, reality) or a mind, the language in many postmodern texts becomes "thickened," played with and shown off, and frequently becomes just another element to be manipu- lated by a self-conscious author. (xxi) In other words, this "awakening" represents what for most readers of postmodern fiction postmodernism is: a metafictional wonderland of exuberant, iconoclastic play. Since McCaffery is aware of the inadequacy of this equation (metafiction = postmodernism) and is troubled by the claims - triviality, self-absorption, narcissism, elitism - that have been lodged against the strategies and intentions of metafiction (as well as those of poststruc- turalism), he is intent both on demonstrating that "postmodern fic- tion contains the potential to rejoin the history which some claim it has abandoned" (xxv) and on distinguishing "the postmodern awaken- ing" of the sixties and early seventies from what has followed it since. Thus in his final section he argues, as he had earlier in The Metafic- tional Muse, that "with a few notable exceptions . . . most of the important, vital fiction of the last decade were neither exclusively experimental in an obvious, flamboyant manner, nor representational in a traditional, realist sense" (xxvii). Exactly. Yet even if one agrees completely with this "periodization" of postmodernism, as I do, it becomes difficult not to be troubled by some of its implications. To begin with-and as McCaffery's title for his final section, "Post- Postmodernism: The Evolution of Contemporary Consciousness," sug- POSTMODERNISM 135</page><page sequence="4">gests - it is not altogether clear whether "the important, vital fiction" we are dealing with here is, properly speaking, postmodern or whether it qualifies as some other lineal descendant of the original nineteenth- and twentieth-century antirealist impulses that have given us in turn modernism, postmodernism, and now, perhaps, still another varia- tion on the basic theme. Again, I hope I have made it clear that my intention is not to fault McCaffery but to worry along with him about how exactly to make sense of a period so patently various and eclectic. Inevitably, questions present themselves. Will the guiding notions that informed "early" postmodernism prove adequate to the exploration and under- standing of "contemporary consciousness"? Or has the term, however broadly construed, by now lost some of its taxonomic edge? One thing at least seems clear: the dividing line between inclusiveness and chaos is a thin one; and if McCaffery's commendably expanded canon makes room for any number of writers who have been excluded by too rigorously systematic charters of the present age, it also, on occasion, blurs the distinctions that help us to recognize different kinds of fiction as fundamentally different ways of apprehending and coming to terms with the impingements of the world around us. As I've already indi- cated, I have trouble in particular with the appearance in a book on postmodernism of such figures as Didion, Beattie, and Carver. McCaffery, to be sure, is too sophisticated not to make a plausible case for his selections, and these writers, along with others like Frederick Barthelme and Jayne Anne Phillips, are slotted in under the rubric of "experimental realism," a term meant to designate "fic- tion that is fundamentally realistic in its impulses but that develops innovative strategies in structure . . language . .. the use of unusual materials ... and so on" (xxvii). But, or so it seems to me, no amount of talk about "the nonendings of Beattie, Carver, Barthelme" or "the use of 'found' materials in Beattie" (xxvii) contravenes the fact that for such authors the world remains, as it does for the more traditional realists McCaffery deliberately omits from Postmodern Fiction (and as it does not for postmodernists), the site of uncontested limits and unrecognized boundaries. Still, better to stir things up by seeking out new definitions that challenge readers to formulate their own conceptions of postmodernism than to rest comfortably within the fold of metafictional orthodoxy. And better by far to call attention to the effort on the part of recent writers "to discover new methods of reconnecting with the world out- side the page, outside of language" (xxvi). The succeeding "overview 136 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">articles," or the best of them, follow McCaffery's lead and raise ques- tions about currently received ideas rather than simply perpetuating them. (Inevitably, some of the critical discussions are more challeng- ing than others, but with few exceptions, most notably Welch D. Ever- man's tediously repetitive and elementary survey of postmodern science fiction, the level is admirably high.) The essays themselves, thirteen on postmodern fiction, two useful and suggestive ones on postmodern criticism - a proportion that appears justifiable enough given the wealth of material available on deconstruction and other poststructuralist movements - are remarkably various and, as in the section I discussed earlier, reflect the editor's determination both to enlarge the canon (as a result of which, perhaps, comparatively little special attention is given to writers generally thought of as canonical: Barth, Donald Barthelme, Pynchon, and so on) and to make room for the paraliterary. The first question to be asked, then, is what, if anything, binds these essays together. According to McCaffery, his critics "were supplied only one basic guideline: the primary focus of the volume was to be on fiction that had rejected traditional notions of represen- tation, mimesis, or realism, or that was attempting to redefine what realism is" (xii). In light of this injunction, it is hardly surprising that realism rather than modernism supplies the oppositional paradigm for the volume. (It is striking, in fact, how little modernism figures in these essays as a movement: how consistently it is treated as an ancillary forerunner, a source of precursors, a matter, so to speak, of pre- postmodernism.) Hydra-headed or, better, a literary Antaeus await- ing some conquering Hercules to sever its connection with earth, with reality, realism helps to create the book's contrasts (margins versus centers, circularity versus linearity, fragments versus wholes, decen- tered versus stable selves, subjectivity versus objectivity, the reflexive versus the referential [see, especially, Thomas LeClair's "Postmodern Mastery"]); to define its themes (fragmentation, "the tentative nature of all perception" [53], the primacy of language and the conception of reality as something formed through the fictional, constitutive power of language); and to focus its oppositions (to, among other things, representation, narrative, character, humanism, and traditional generic boundaries [see Ron Silliman's discussion of "a postgeneric poet's prose" (541) in "New Prose, New Prose Poem" and in his entry on Barrett Watten]). I am generalizing, of course, and it is possible to find exceptions to my remarks throughout, as in the essay called "Postmodern Poetry and Fiction: The Connective Links," in which Fred Moramarco argues POSTMODERNISM 137</page><page sequence="6">that "the poetry and fiction of postmodernism is intimately connected to the events of its time and committed to broadly humanistic values" (138). Or in Bonnie Zimmerman's "Feminist Fiction and the Post- modern Challenge," an enormously skillful and rewarding combination of theory, taxonomy, and illustration, which ends its discussion of "a demonstrably reflexive, experimental tendency in some feminist fiction" (177) by asserting that "more arguments exist for a postmodern feminist aesthetic than do examples of one .... Most fiction by women writers . . . remains committed to realism. . . . And even the most experimental of writers remain convinced that language - however variously used - represents something, something real and relational" (186). But if Zimmerman takes exception to some of the attitudes and conclusions found elsewhere in Postmodern Fiction, it is no less evident that for her, as for many other critics in the volume, realism remains a point of reference, a bench mark by which to judge the contemporary flux. And something more than that as well. A surprisingly large number of the essays attempt, as Jerome Klinkowitz says, "not a return to simple realism . .. but . .. rather a logical progression from inno- vative fiction in literature and [Klinkowitz's particular wrinkle, to which I'll return in a moment] abstract expressionism in art" (63). Thus realism makes a variety of appearances in the book, in combination with this or that adjective, as magic realism (Lori Chamberlain), experimental realism (McCaffery, Klinkowitz), and expanded realism (Zimmerman). (See too Geoffrey Green's "The Extremities of Realism," LeClair's "Postmodern Mastery," and "Latin American Literature from the 'Boom' On" by Doris Sommer and George Yudice.) As one might expect, the ideal of a revitalized realism becomes plural and at times contradictory in the hands of these various critics. What matters is that, like their editor, so many of them feel the need to move beyond metafiction's mythical domination of the postmodern scene and to find ways of dealing with the demonstrable heterogeneity of contemporary fiction. Whether the use of the term "realism," however modified and redefined, offers the best way of dealing with fictions that presum- ably oppose and move beyond everything it has traditionally signified is perhaps for the moment a moot point, but this much at least is self- evident: there is no little danger in enlisting the enemy's vocabulary in the service of the fight for a braver and newer world, which, one would have thought, requires new words as much as it does new concepts. For obvious reasons, the more radical the concepts involved, the more dramatic the problem. Since Zimmerman and McCaffery are 138 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">speaking about what is by any definition essentially realistic litera- ture, there is no major tension apparent in their use of the word. Chamberlain's attempt to combine "the dailiness of realism and the risks of experimentalism" (18) into "a kind of oxymoron" (17) is more problematic. But it is Klinkowitz's attempt at hybridization that throws the difficulty into sharpest relief. (It should be said, incidentally, that, despite my several and fundamental disagreements, this essay, along with LeClair's, Sommer and Yudice's, Silliman's, and the others men- tioned in this paragraph, is among the most provocative and challeng- ing in the book.) The informing insight of Klinkowitz's argument is that as abstract expressionism leads logically and inevitably to super- realism in painting, so fictional reflexiveness leads to the advent of experimental realism. The exploration of this analogy, which, regard- less of its assertion about development, perpetuates most of the received ideas of metafictional discourse, is too intricate to unravel here. It is possible only to note some of the major qualities Klinkowitz finds in superrealism and experimental realism alike, namely, an "all over" effect (that is, "the indiscriminate spread of perception over a broad, flat surface" [64]); an antihierarchical bias (intellectualism and "projec- tive anthropomorphism must be banished" [67]); an attention to the materiality, the hardness and flatness, of the fiction or painting "thanks to the emphasis on conventions as conventions rather than as indices to greater meaning" (71); and, finally, a total concern with surface, as a result of which we are given, in place of meaning and story, "a syntax of signs" (73). Since, according to Klinkowitz, a sign for the various painters and writers he discusses means only itself, it follows that what we are dealing with is, he insists, "not a transparent signifier but rather a self- apparently opaque sign, a true thing in itself" (65). Now, whereas it is easy enough to agree that the question is "not reality itself but how we perceive it" (66) and that "we know reality only through our fictions" (75)- postmodernism's and poststructuralism's sense of breaking new ground notwithstanding, most eighteenth-century thinkers would not have disagreed with either assertion - it is something else again to speak of "the absolute opacity of sign" (67) or of "avoiding contamination of sign by reality" (74). Do we not, willy-nilly, forge or create (if not, one can concede, transparently discover) meaning in our intercourse with the world? And is it quite so easy to avoid the contamination of the reality (our bodies, the world) in which we are situated? In any case, and as I've already suggested, it is not altogether clear that Klinkowitz's experimental realism differs markedly or substantively POSTMODERNISM 139</page><page sequence="8">from the sort of reflexive fiction it is said to supersede or that realism itself, however adjectivally qualified, best expresses the nature of the novels and stories Klinkowitz describes. Nor is it altogether obvious that Klinkowitz himself fully accepts his own arguments. His other essay in the book, "Writing Under Fire: Postmodern Fiction and the Vietnam War," adopts an altogether more traditional attitude toward problems of meaning and reference as it sets out to examine "a body of fiction that relies on various innovative formal devices . . . to capture a sense of that war's assault on lan- guage and on our sense of reality" (79). But I have said enough about realism as it threads its way through Postmodern Fiction. The other general point that needs to be made here about the overview essays is that, however usual the association of postmodernism with play and jouissance and of poststructuralist criticism with the pleasures of the text and deconstructive skepticism (note the delighted violence and iconoclastic glee of R. Radhakrishnan's essay on contemporary theory), most of the critics in this volume, including Klinkowitz, are in vary- ing degrees intensely moral, even moralistic and didactic. Typically, Martina Sciolino, intent on showing how ideologically self-aware post- modernism is, writes that "metafiction allows writers to show social responsibility by insisting that all meanings are provisional" (144), while LeClair in his exemplary study credits the writers he discusses with "not just mastery of innovative or postmodern methods, but also mastery of extraliterary experience" (117) and argues that "for all their negations the authors' assembling of grand constructs is itself an affirmation of art's morality" (123-24). In other words, since language and literature (and realism especially) promote ideologies, it is the thrust of essay after essay, as well as of many of the shorter pieces in the book's second section, to promote alternative ideologies, even if, or because, it is recognized that perception is subjective and that reality is a fictional construct - or, in the currently more fashionable phrase, a purely discursive formation. All of this, it seems to me, is good news. Just as the moral force of modernism often lay buried under charges of aestheticism and ivory towerism and was obscured by associations with New Critical talk of the autotelic work of art, so the moral impulses of postmodernism have as often as not been held captive (though not by Linda Hutcheon in her Narcissistic Narrative or by McCaffery himself in The Meta- fictional Muse) by equally extreme claims about metafiction's own autotelic status and its total independence from the world of ordinary human preoccupations. In saying this, I have no intention of mini- 140 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">mizing the differences between the two movements, which are not my concern here. My point is simply that in reading Postmodern Fiction one comes away with a considerably richer sense of what is at stake in the enterprise it means to celebrate than one did from a number of earlier, narrower, and more self-serving manifestoes. In his intro- duction McCaffery states that his intention was to "encourage a variety of viewpoints which . . . would suggest some of the key features of postmodern fiction" (xii). The claim is accurate but too modestly put. Postmodern Fiction is a major reference guide that, because it so amply and admirably fulfills its editor's aim, should be consulted by all stu- dents of the field and that, even as the field continues to grow and change, is likely to serve as a point de repere for a good many years to come. What we take away from the book, besides a variety of intelli- gent viewpoints, a good deal of useful information, and a host of chal- lenging ideas, is a sense of postmodernism as something, in the words LeClair uses to describe his novelists of excess and performance, at least potentially "both deconstructive and reconstructive" (118). Given the pre-eminence of deconstruction in recent decades, one can only applaud this new emphasis on the possibilities, however various and tentative, of reconstruction. No doubt the world (or "reality") remains as problematic, as contingent, as subjectively construed as ever, but at least, much of Postmodern Fiction suggests, it has become pos- sible once again to meditate our relationship to it.
