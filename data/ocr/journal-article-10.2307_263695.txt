<plain_text><page sequence="1">Madness in Ancient Literature. By AINSWORTH O'BRIEN-MOORE. Princeton University Dissertation. Weimar: R. Wahner Sohn, 1924. Pp. 228. In his introductory paragraph the writer of this dissertation tells us that he proposes to limit his study largely to "the elevated representations of mad-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 379 ness in literature of the grand manner," and to consider the popular, medical, and comic aspects of the subject "only as a contrast and background to the literary." He limits his subject further by refusing to consider all of the phe- nomena which the ancients called mad and we do not, and vice versa, and by eliminating the few historical instances of madness; and he then proceeds to discuss in turn the popular and medical conceptions and their reflection in comedy and prose, before taking up the detailed examination of madness as it occurs in tragic and epic poetry. He infers that madness was popularly re- garded as due to possession by a Ker or 8atipuv from the fact that the other ills of life were so conceived, from the use of the words aLLAOVaVv and KaKo&amp;uaL/ovav in connection with madness, and from the fact that the larvae, which are clearly agents of madness in certain plays of Plautus, indicate the same ani- mistic belief. The medical conception is shown to rest on the theory that the body is composed of four humors and that disease is caused by an excess of some one of the four. Madness is thus conceived to be due to an excess of black bile, and the ordinary remedy is hellebore. Turning to "elevated" literature, the writer finds only very scanty refer- ences to madness in Homer, but thinks that there is a trace there of its ulti- mate cause-which in this type of literature is always a god-and also of the violent behavior of the madman. In considering Aeschylus' contribution he discusses the mantic possession of Cassandra, and the development of the Erinyes from vague angry ghosts, who have the power to make men mad, into anthropomorphic deities. The figure of Lyssa, who appears for the first time as madness in personified form in a fragment of the Xantriae, he regards as essentially a specialized development from the Erinyes. He thinks that Sopho- cles' portrayal of Ajax' madness shows exceptional insight into the workings of delusional insanity. He credits Euripides with the introduction of Bacchic frenzy as a type of madness, and of the new accompanying physical symp- toms, commonly exhibited by drunkenness, feverish delirium, and epilepsy. After Euripides, representations of madness are shown to have become con- ventionalized, and to vary chiefly in the combination of details borrowed from earlier authors, although the description of mantic inspiration was elaborated in later times. This conventionalization is illustrated by pertinent fragments of Roman tragedy, and by the maddening of Amata in Virgil's Aeneid, which is discussed at length. He then traces "the Fury after Virgil," especially as she appears in Ovid's story of Athamas and Silius Italicus' account of the frenzy of the Saguntines, and goes on to show the mixture of elements in the de- scriptions of madness in the late epics by Quintus of Smyrna and Nonnus, and the rhetorical effort in Seneca's Hercules Furens. The work closes with a chap- ter on "The Madness of Mantic Inspiration," in the course of which the vari- ous symptoms shown by certain characters when under the spell of the god are outlined in the form of a chart. This really comprehensive study is written in a vigorous and generally convincing style, while the conservatism with which most statements which</page><page sequence="3">380 BooK REVIEWS cannot be substantiated by obvious evidence are carefully qualified makes it the more praiseworthy. We could wish, however, that further revision had improved several poorly constructed sentences and one or two other slight errors. And we shall not all agree with the writer's estimates and interpreta- tions at every point. For instance, anyone who has staged Euripides' Iphige- neia at Aulis, or who, despite the unsatisfactory condition of the text in many places, has otherwise come to appreciate the keen psychology, the noble dig- nity, and the lofty message of the tragedy, will take exception to the statement that it is "one of the least elevated of his plays." Nor are we all likely to agree with the interpretation of the cause of Odysseus' protesting fear of Ajax in his maddened state. The writer thinks that he is afraid of Ajax because he is aware that his character has undergone a change-because of "the break-down of the restraints that possess a sane man"; but it is, perhaps, quite as likely that it is Ajax' phenomenal maniac strength which he fears. And fur- ther, we may not all agree with the writer in his insistence upon what he terms Aeschylus' supernatural mind. He thinks that the supernatural world of the Erinyes was as real to Aeschylus as the natural world-that Cassandra, as well as Orestes, saw real beings, "actually present, to be seen by one having the power," and that for Aeschylus, Lyssa was "the real and genuine cause of madness." But it will seem more probable to some of us still that Aeschylus, whose spiritual insight grasped so many of the great abiding truths, and whose exaltation of Zeus so often approximates a pure monotheism, merely brought these under-world bogeys out into the light of day and used them as personi- fied creations for literary ends. It is much safer to assume (as the writer does, of course) that Lyssa and the Erinyes were real beings to the common mind than to go so far as to insist that they actually existed in definite form in the mind of Aeschylus himself. We need not dwell upon other incidental points of difference. Taken as a whole, the dissertation is an interesting, scholarly, and useful contribution to our understanding of ancient literature.
