<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Religious and Cultural Roles of Dreams and Visions in Islam" NILE GREEN Introduction Since "visions appear material to spiritual persons only, the vulgar herd of historians and annalists cannot hope to be so favoured by Heaven".1 So, in his nineteenth-century account of the sufls of Sind, Sir Richard Burton expressed the dilemma of scholars researching Muslim dream and visionary experiences in his characteristic style. But while scholarly discussion of the visionary activities of premodern sufls and other Muslims is still no straightforward matter we need no longer be deterred by Burton's sardonic pessimism. Despite the reticence of earlier generations of positivist scholarship, the past two decades have witnessed a flourishing of research into the visionary aspects of Muslim religious and cultural practice, chiefly through the analysis of the extensive literature surrounding the dream and vision in Islam. For, from the very beginning of Islamic history, there has developed a rich and varied discourse on the nature of the imagination and its expression in the form of dreams and waking visions. The theoretical approaches to the imagination developed by early Muslim philosophers and mystical theorists were always accompanied by the activities of a more active sodality of dreamers and vision seekers. For this reason, Islamic tradition is especially rich for its contributions to both theories of the imagination and the description of its expression in dream and visionary experience. The abundant yields from this rich research field in recent years afford new insight into the Muslim past, allowing an often intimate encounter with past individuals and private experiences scarcely granted by the analysis of other kinds of documentation. It was the dreams and subsequent visions of the Prophet Muhammad that announced the beginning of Islam and it is in this sense that the Qur'an itself may be seen as a visionary text. While visions of one kind or another were unsurprisingly an important aspect of sufism in each of its many forms, both visions and dreams also played important roles in many other fields of Muslim life, from historiography and medicine to folklore and magic.2 As many of the episodes discussed in this article reveal, visions and dreams were a crucial means of * This article was researched and written with the financial support of the Sir William Ouseley Memorial Scholarship held at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies from 1999-2001 and the Gordon Milburn Junior Research Fellowship held at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University from October 2002. 1 R.

For in the Muslim literary works that are discussed in this article, one classic characteristic stands out especially that is in common with the premodern literatures of other civilisations. This is the weight of history, the importance of access to the past and concurrence and continuity with the models provided by it. It is therefore no surprise that the visionary and oneirocritical literature of Islam shows a greater preponderance towards bringing alive the past into present experience than looking forward into futures as yet unreal. This crucial fracture between the major directions taken by the modern and premodern imagination reminds us at the onset of the relationship of the imagination to a wider Gedankenwelt. It is this cultural embeddedness of dreams and visions within a shared Islamic universe of symbols that suggests the customs and literature of the dream and vision in Islam may form a useful means of charting some of the parameters of the inner imaginative universe of the Muslim past. The Pre-Islamic Heritage When early Muslims came to generate models with which to understand imaginative experiences, particularly in their most widespread form as dreams, they drew in part on the common cultural heritage that the ancient Near East provided to both Islam and Christianity before it.3 The practice of dream interpretation in the Near East stretched back to the very beginnings of Mesopotamian civilisation, being handed on thereafter partly through the religion of the Jews (as in the biblical story of Joseph, a tradition no less important to Islam and related in the Qur'an).4 It was the late antique legacy of Greek culture, however, with its similar fascination with dreams that was the most direct funnel into Islam of earlier traditions of dream theories.5 After some of the earliest Greek literary references to the dream (oneiros) in Homer, later Greek thinkers developed a number of systematic theories of dreaming.6 In his Timaeus, Plato offered an interesting theory of mantic dreams, claiming that while they originate from the insight of the rational soul they are perceived by the irrational soul as images reflected on the smooth surface of the liver (hence their obscure, symbolic character). Plato in this way allowed such dreams an indirect relationship to reality, albeit not one that he rated very highly More important were Aristotle's short essays On Dreams and On Divination in Sleep, which denied that any dreams are god-sent. Reasonably enough, Aristotle argued that if the gods wanted to communicate with humankind they would do it in the daytime and be more selective about the recipients of their nocturnal messages. Despite Aristotle's sceptical approach to the dream, it continued to play an important role in both the popular religious life of late antiquity (particularly through the popularity of the cult of Asclepius) and the writings of philosophers and occultists.

The classification of dreams in the writings of Artemidorus described a type of symbolic dream (often including riddles) as well as the vision (horama) that was a clear pre-enactment of future events and the oracle (chrematismos), when the dreamers parent, or some other respected or impressive personage, reveals, in a literal manner, the nature of future events and advises on how to deal with them. Through direct translations and the writing of epitomes, the dream theories of classical thinkers like Aristotle and Artemidorus, as well as a wider series of speculative philosophical works touching upon the subject of dreaming, were later made available to Muslim thinkers.7 While poorly documented, the pre-Islamic Arabs had certainly possessed their own understanding of dream experiences and means of relating dreams to their waking lives. They possessed, for example, diviners and dream interpreters in the form of the kdhin, ecstatic soothsayers who were seen to be able to recite inspired oracles. Dreams were also sometimes actively sought by the pre-Islamic Arabs by saying special prayers at the Ka'bah or by sleeping beside it.8 Literary evidence of the Arab experience of the dream and vision during the jahiliyyah is also attested to in the abundance of poetry that has survived from that period. Popular in the naslb style of the ode (qasidah) from the pre-Islamic period is the motif of the poet resting at night only to be haunted by the vision (khayal, tayf) of his beloved.9 The Dream and Vision in Early Islam While there were clearly a number of ready models of analytical theories of dreaming to hand for Muslim intellectuals in the early centuries of Islam, dreams and visions had nonetheless been themselves an integral part of Islam from its very beginnings. The primary revelation of Islam had come through the experience of the Prophet Muhammad's visionary encounter with the archangel Jabra'il. Sweating, clammy and hearing bells ringing in his ears, in what is perhaps literary history's greatest apotheosis of the wracking pains of inspiration, the result of Muhammad's numinous fear and trembling was the birth of the Qur'an. The Qur'an (39:42 and 6:60) itself upholds the validity of dream experiences when it tells believers that in dreams the soul is taken back into the presence of God. Accounts of the visions and dreams (ru'ya, manam) of both Muhammad and earlier prophets also feature in the Qur'an.10 The dream most famously occurs in the Qur'anic accounts of the life of Yusuf (12:1-100) and the sacrifice of Ishaq (37:83-113), while in Surat al-Fath (48:27) the scripture also recounts a clairvoyant dream of the Prophet in which he foresaw his eventual triumphant return to Makkah. These canonical prototypes of dreams and visions as at times prognosticating and 7 See A. E.

The hadith are also replete with accounts of the dreams of the Prophet and his companions or references by them to dreaming. One often quoted tradition held that the Prophet himself had said that such dreams constitute one forty-sixth part of prophecy.11 The simh literature also contains many accounts of the Prophet's dreams and visions (especially his ascent to heaven). These dreams were often related to major events in his life and were related along with accounts of the dream-life of his companions. One of the most interesting episodes in the Sirat Rasiil Allah of Ibn Ishaq refers to a dream of one of the companions, 'Abd Allah ibn Zayd.12 'Abd Allah recounted to the Prophet a dream in which he had encountered a man wearing two green garments and carrying a clapper. 'Abd Allah had asked to buy the clapper, explaining that he would use it for summoning people to prayer, at which the man explained that there was a better way to do this and instructed 'Abd Allah in the performance of the call to prayer (adhan). On hearing this account, the Prophet declared the dream an authentic vision from God and had the first mil 'adhin Bilal instructed accordingly. Here we see how the adhan, one of the most characteristic features of Muslim life, was regarded as having been established through the intervention of a dream. Yet a whole host of less momentous dreams and visions also feature in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah, such as the vision in which al-Tufayl al-DawsT sees himself with his head shaven and with a bird coming out of his mouth, which was later seen as having prophesied his martyrdom during the reign of the caliph 'Umar (634-644 AD).13 For his part, the companion and first caliph, Abu Bakr (r.632-634 AD) was widely regarded as a gifted interpreter of dreams.14 After the prophet Yiisuf, it was the pious Iraqi traditionist Ibn Slrln (d.728 AD) who was regarded as the most famous of Muslim dream interpreters. His early fame as a scholar of hadith was eclipsed by a growing reputation as an interpreter of dreams (mu (abbir) and by the tenth century numerous treatises on dreams had been posthumously ascribed to him in much the same way as publishers faked books by popular authors in the early history of European publishing.15 Ibn Sirln s name certainly features in the earliest known Arabic work of dream interpretation, the DusturfVl ta'bir of Abu Ishaq al-Kirmani (fl.775-785 AD). The earliest of the texts ascribed to Ibn Slrln himself was entitled simply Ta'bir al-ru'ya, though the numbers of such texts escalated so that by the fifteenth century it was possible for an Arabic compilation of Ibn Sinn's supposed works to appear. So widespread was his renown that the great ChishtT sufi of Dihll, Nizam al-dln Awliya (d.1325 AD) made reference to his dream interpretations (albeit as received via al-Ghazall) in his discourses that were recorded in Fawa'id al-fu'ad. Later works were attributed to Ibn Sinn in Turkish and Persian as well as Greek and Latin.16 11 A. J. Wensinck, Concordance et Indices de la Tradition Musulmane (Leiden, 1936-1969), vol. 1, p. 343.

Fahd, "Ibn Sirin", in Eh.</page><page sequence="5">The Religious and Cultural Roles of Dreams and Visions in Islam 291 Other pious early figures also came to be associated with the subject. One early Persian treatise on the interpretation of dreams was attributed to no less a figure than the sixth Shl'I imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq (d.765 AD).17 Of greater influence, however, were those works created as a result of caliphal patronage, that reflected the importance of the subject in 'Abbasid Baghdad. For example a version of the Oneirocritica of Artemidorus was translated into Arabic at the request of al-Ma'mun (r.813-833 AD). Marking the long reach of the shadows of classical antiquity, the prestige of Artemidorus among Muslim thinkers is demonstrated through his citations in the other great caliphal dream manual. This was the voluminous al-Qadirt fVl ta'bir of Abu Sa'Td al-Dmawan (d.c.1009 AD) that was commissioned in 1006 by the caliph al-Qadir (991-1031 AD).18 During this period the bookseller and bibliographer Ibn al-Nadlm (d.996 AD?) recorded the details of some ten of the dream manuals that were available in Baghdad.19 Including works by Artemidorus and the neo-platonist Porphyry as well as Ibn Sinn and al-Kirmani, al-Nadlm's Fihrist is further proof of the cosmopolitan atmosphere in which such works flourished. Interestingly, these texts were classified in the section of his catalogue dealing with magic, alchemy and the occult, a section which was one of the most extensive of his inventory. By the ninth century a written oneirocritical tradition had developed in Arabic that was supplemented by a wider oral tradition. In a reflection of its antique predecessors, early Muslim dream-theory posited three different types of dream. The first and most common type has its origins in bodily sensations, such as heat, discomfort or indigestion. A rarer second type provides glimpses of future events, but it is only the third and most blessed type that forms the veridical dream that is a special class of personalised divine message. To the standard classical dream repertoire, Islam also added the possibility of the satanic dream (hulm), a dream capable of leading the dreamer wildly astray. However its graver implications were overridden by a saying of the Prophet relating that neither Satan nor any of the jinn could assume the Prophet's form in a dream and so rob a believer of that most favoured of all dreams. Indeed, in one of the first hadith in Bukharl's Sahih the Prophet explained that "Whoever has seen me has seen me truly, and Satan cannot take my form".20 In practice, this sometimes came to mean that dreams of the Prophet could form a legally waterproof means of legitimating all kinds of arguments, persons or policies. Yet dreams of the Prophet have formed one of the earliest and most lasting expressions of Islamic piety.21 The Prophet's own son-in-law 'All had described one such Prophetic dream of his own in a sermon found in his Nahj al-balaghah, while dreams of the Prophet continue to be important to believers in the modern day.22 The purposes of such prophetic visits, however, were many. Muhammad might thus appear to reveal to the dreamer his future grave, to urge a celibate mystic to follow him in the path of married life or to express his approval of a writer's work. 17 See H. Hosain, "A Treatise on the Interpretation of Dreams", Islamic Culture 6, 4 (1932). 18 T. Fahd and H.

Following Aristotle, al-Farabi (d.950 AD) reasoned that the soul thought in images. It was these symbols, originating in the divine active intellect, that could under certain conditions be made manifest in dreams and so serve clairvoyant or even prophetic purposes.23 Subsequently this theory was to influence Ibn Sma (d.1037 AD), though in his Kitab al-shifa' he was to modify the theory to describe the prophetic dream as an act of providence (Hnayah) from the divine. In an important prefiguring of later sufi approaches to the dream, Ibn Slna saw such providence as allotted to all humans in different degrees and not as in any way unique to the prophets.24 The practice of philosophy at times came together with dreaming in interesting ways during this period and al-Ma'mun (r.813-833 AD), the great caliphal patron of Islamic philosophy and the translation of Greek works into Arabic, was said to have experienced a dream encounter with Aristotle.25 In the dream Aristotle lectured the caliph on the meaning of the good, while the bibliographer al-Nadim later asserted that this encounter had also resulted in the caliph's promotion of book production. In the Muslim west, dream theory was later discussed by Ibn Rushd (d.1198 AD) and the philosopher of history Ibn Khaldun (d.1406 AD). With regard to the vision in Islam, the life of the Prophet formed a major model and point of reference. Subsequently, the locus classicus of the vision in Islam has always been the Night Journey {isra}) to Jerusalem and the Second Journey (mi(raj) through the heavens undergone by Muhammad.26 The main source of the mi(raj motif was the account given in the Qur'an (17:1 and 53:1-18) which although not mentioning the Prophet by name has always been assumed to refer to him. In this touchstone of all Muslim visions, the Prophet ascended through each of the heavenly spheres until famously coming within a distance of 'the length of two bows' away from the inner presence of God. In its many subsequent elaborations, it is a story redolent with rich imagery of many different kinds. Particularly vivid is the tradition that before the celestial journey otherworldly figures came to remove Muhammad's internal organs, an image rich with correspondences to the shaman's flight and paintings of the preparations for the voyage to the Sun in pharaonic tomb paintings. As the early revelation contained in the Qur'an was gradually transformed into the basis for a more complex urban civilisation in the early centuries of Islam, the nature of the experience undergone by the Prophet became a topic of tremendous intellectual importance. Later mystics like Shah Ni'mat Allah Wall (d.1431 AD) were to write commentaries on these verses.27 This Qur'anic point of reference lent the vision great prestige as well as legitimacy, both of which were reinforced by many hadith as well as, in turn, later traditions which elaborated the theme further.28 Nonetheless, the subject 23 See T. Fahd, La Divination Arabe (Strasbourg, 1966), pp. 51-60 and M. W. Ur-Rahman, "Al-Farabi and his Theory of Dreams", Islamic Culture 10 (1936). 24 See T. Fahd (1966), pp. 51-60 and T. Fahd and H.

The Prophet's journey became a popular theme in oral and written traditions all around the Mediterranean. One medieval Arabic version of the mir'aj story composed in al-Andalus was subsequently translated into Latin.30 This text as well as oral traditions of the story have been seen by some scholars as a key influence on Dante's literary vision of his own journey through the cosmos as recounted in the Commedia.3] However, further east the Prophet's celestial journey became a source of inspiration for writers in Persian. The Mi'rajnama of Ibn Slna is the earliest of its type in Persian prose, while among the more notable poems to have been written in Persian on the theme are those by the Iranian poet Jamal al-dln 'AlawT (d.1590 AD) and the south Indian poet 'Azam BTjapurT (fl.1666 AD). Such mi'rdjndmas were even written in Tamil by Muslim poets writing in the far south of India as late as the eighteenth century and, in lithographic form, they became a popular feature of Iranian booksellers' catalogues during the nineteenth century.32 In Islamic tradition the mi'rdj was seen to epitomise the notion of the vision as a genuine revelation from God, as a true epistemic rupture (or fath, literally an 'opening') of everyday reality. The Prophet's visionary experience was always recounted in a highly symbolic language, something that provided later believers with a witness to the role of symbols in visionary experience. But it also provided fertile material for artists. Vivid painted depictions of the Prophet's Night Journey, along with various imaginings of his mysterious steed Buraq, came to form one of the most widespread forms of Muslim devotional art. It is the visionary creature Buraq himself who is often the most lovingly portrayed element in these paintings, over time evolving the beautiful face of a young man upon his taut equine body and a peacock's tail fanned out at his rear. However, earlier depictions of Buraq sometimes show a startling resemblance to images of the winged lion representation of St Matthew the Evangelist found carved on Romanesque churches. Such images of the mi'rdj were occasionally found in books of divination (fdlnamas) in which miniature paintings of the prophets were paired with poetic forecasts of the reader's future, as in the case of a mid sixteenth century example from Safawid Tabriz or QazwTn.33 An example of the vibrancy of the traditions of the mi (rdj in the religious imagination of modern-day Muslims are the paintings of Buraq found on the sides of lorries in Pakistan in order to provide the blessing of a safe journey as they plod through the hazardous mountain roads of the region.34 2 See e.g. A.

Blanc, Afghan Trucks (London, 1976).</page><page sequence="8">294 M7e Green The Dream and Vision Among the Sufis The most important early example of a non-prophetic vision in sufi tradition was that of the mystical ascent of Abu Yazld al-BistamT (d.874 AD). Different accounts of Abu Yazld's visions were recorded in the descriptions written by more desk-loving sufis like Sarraj (d.988 AD), a pseudo-Junayd of Baghdad and the celebrated Persian poet 'Attar (d.c.1221 AD).35 In time the hoary ecstatic dervish Abu Yazld became in subsequent sufi literature a kind of mystical Urmensch and many later sufis were to have their own dreams about meeting him. Other early writers also spoke of the visionary encounter with God undergone by the great early female saint of Islam, Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyyah (d.801 AD). But perhaps the importance of veridical dreams to the sufis is best seen in the story in the Tabaqat al-sujiyyah of 'Abd Allah Ansari which recounts how Shah Shuja' KirmanI (d.c.88o AD) went without sleep for forty years until one night he slept and saw the Prophet in a dream, after which he was always to be seen either asleep or trying to sleep.36 Albeit often with a certain caution, such visionary tales also became a common feature of accounts of later sufis, like Muhammad Ghawth Gwallari (d. 1562-3 AD).37 The fact that many sufi" writers had been more concerned with the amazing subject matter of the spellbinding visions of their early mentors suggests that they allowed themselves, at times, to leave the more trifling category of the dream to the chattering classes of Baghdad. Texts such as the Kashf al-mahjub of'All al-HujwTri (d.c.1072 AD) are replete with stories of the visions of the early sufis.38 Yet dreams continued to play an important role in sufism and by the time of the composition of the 'Awarif al-ma'arif of'Umar SuhrawardT (d.1234 AD), theories of dreaming were a commonplace of sufi literature. Thus Suhrawardl devoted a chapter of his book to the role of dreams in tasawwuf?9 Once again the crucial reference point in the 'Awarif al-ma'arif was the Prophet Muhammad, though more curious was Suhrawardl's method of attributing different types of vision with the different elements of nature transcended in the defeat of the lower soul (nafs). Dreams of deserts thus relate to earth, oceans to water and so on. A common sufi idea was the notion that veridical dreams formed a lesser type of the waking vision that was more suitable to the neophyte whose visionary or imaginative faculties have yet to fully awaken. The main topos for this was once again the Prophet Muhammad, who had himself experienced dream premonitions before receiving his first vision of Jabra'il. More prolific sufis devoted entire works to the subject, as in the case ofAsmar al-asrar of Muhammad al-Husayni Gesu Daraz (d.1422 AD).40 The Crystalisation of Sufi Visionary Theory While the early sufis simply spoke of visions in terms of a breaching into "the world of the unseen" ('alam al-ghayb), the most important codification of a formal theory of the dream 35 See M.

A visionary and a philosopher, SuhrawardT aimed to make the ancient religious systems of pre-Islamic Iran (as well as those of ancient Greece and Egypt) meld with Islam to form a truly cosmopolitan theory of mystical knowledge in which the visionary experiences sought by the sufls played a pivotal role. It is SuhrawardT who appears to have been the first to schematise the realm of vision into a proper world of its own, accessed through the mode of knowledge he suggestively entitled the wisdom of oriental illumination (hikmat al-ishraq). SuhrawardT laid out this epistemological system in his Kitab hikmat al-ishraq and other lesser Arabic works and, more intimately, in a number of visionary narratives composed in Persian.41 As some of the earliest examples of Persian prose writing, the place of these visionary recitals in the history of Persian letters is evocative of the wider importance of the vision in Islamic culture at large. It is noteworthy that SuhrawardT borrowed both the model of the symbolic risalah and the title of his philosophical system from the earlier work of Ibn Slna. Whether or not Ibn Slna had sought to formulate a more mystical system of knowledge later in his career, in which visions played an increased role, remains uncertain if not entirely impossible to answer.42 For SuhrawardT, both visions and their lesser kindred of dreams take place in an intermediate world between that of concrete phenomenal reality and the realm of pure intellectual abstraction. Possessing form but not substance, he referred to this intermediate world as the world of likenesses ((dlam al-mithal). Connecting it back to the foundations of the Muslim faith, he also frequently referred to it by the Qur'anic term of isthmus or interface (barzakh). Through its custody of symbols as its mode of communication, this cosmic sphere (or alternatively, level of existence) was seen to act as an intermediary between God's non delimited knowledge and our own fragmentary understanding the universe. It was also seen to act as the interface between the living and the dead and was in this sense understood as acting as the visionary meeting ground for living sufls and their dead predecessors. As a proper realm of existence that mediated between different kinds of and levels of being, the (dlam al-mithal thus played an important part in the cosmological model which underpinned SuhrawardT s wider mystical epistemology.43 For the first time in Islamic thought, visions and dreams were here enrobed with a special sphere of existence of their own. No longer regarded as simple messages from on high they were seen as in some way actual events existentially undergone at a different level of our being. Not wishing to merely show himself solely as a master of theory, SuhrawardT naturally also described a number of visions of his own. These included a meeting with the philosopher Aristotle in which SuhrawardT enquired as to the relative achievements of earlier generations of spiritual aspirants.44 Aristotle told him that while none of the Muslim philosophers had reached even a thousandth part of the rank of the Divine Plato, early sufls like Abu Yazid al-Bistaml (d.875 AD) and Sahl al-TustarT (d.896 AD) could be confirmed as true men Sohrawardi, Le Livre de la Sagesse Orientale [Kitab Hikmat al-Ishraq], trans.

Over a century later the sufi 'Ala' al-Dawlah al-Simnanl (d.1336 AD) would have a vision in which he in turn denounced Suhrawardl's mystical achievements.45 Such episodes draw our attention to the role of dreams and visions in the legitimation of various individuals, processes or institutions. Yet as well as playing an important role in the development of Persian literature, the short treatises purporting to describe Suhrawardl's own private visions outlined a typology of the initiatory mystical vision for his own disciples and later mystics to follow. In one of these visions, described in the treatise 'Aql-e-surkh, Suhrawardl encounters a mysterious wayfarer who looks both youthful and ancient at the same time.46 Glowing with a strange crimson hue all over, the stranger explains that he is the first born of creation, an archangel perpetually glowing with the primordial sunrise that was the dawn of creation.47 A generation later, a re-working of the theory of the 'alam al-mithal was to feature prominently in the grand systematisation of mystical experience that was the life work of Ibn 'Arabi of Mursiyyah (d.1240 AD). In Ibn 'Arabfs system the role of the imaginative faculty (khayal) played an increased role as the creative agent that is active in understanding.48 Indeed, Ibn 'Arabi viewed mystic man's own imaginative impulse as an essential aspect of God's eternal and unrepeating self-manifestation (tajalli). He in this way considered the use of the imagination to be the essential part of the journey into God, as the supreme human faculty capable of bridging the existential gap between human and divine knowledge. In this we witness the axiomatic yes/no formulation present in so many mystical theories, for Ibn 'Arabi regarded visions as, at the same instant, both descending from God to man as a private revelation and ascending from man to God as a creative visual encounter with the divine. Every original and creative act of man (the freedom of whom he was keen not to limit) was at another level to be seen as a divine act of self-manifestation, tying in with Ibn 'Arabi's wider theory of the unity of existence (wahdat aUwujud). Such ideas of the spiritual importance of the imagination were to recur throughout Muslim civilisation during the following centuries as Ibn 'Arabi's ideas were spread in manuscript form and through the writings of later commentators.49 One of the most interesting later expressions of Ibn 'Arabi's theory of the imagination appeared in the Adah al-mashq, a sixteenth-century guidebook to the art of calligraphy, in which the great Iranian calligrapher Baba Shah Isfahan! (d. 1587-8 AD) developed the idea of imaginative practice (mashq-e-khayali) as a means of reaching the divine perfection inherent in the beauty of Arabic calligraphy.50 Ibn 'Arabi also devoted considerable attention to the subject of dreams. His ideas on dreaming found most famous expression in the chapters on the especial theophanic See J. J.

In northern India, the shrine of Pattishah specialises in the cure of psychiatric conditions and makes use of techniques combining the tradition of Graeco-Islamic medicine (yunani tibb) with more local therapeutic methods.54 Like the life of his precursor SuhrawardT, Ibn 'ArabT's own life was also notable for an abundance of visionary episodes. These began in 1190 while he was living in the Spanish city of Qurtubah during his youth and experienced a mystical encounter with the souls of all of the prophets (including Musa, Tsa and Muhammad).55 It was around this time that Ibn 'ArabI wrote an account of the sufls of Spain entitled Ruh al-quds, in which he showed that visions of this kind (if not of this masterly degree) were a far from unusual feature of the Islamic milieu of the southern Europe of his day.56 Yet even by the high standards of the visionary carpenters and cobblers of Andalusia, Ibn 'ArabT's own vocation for visions was exceptional. His commentator Sadr al-dln QunawT (d.1273 AD) later described how his master could summon the spirit of any dead person (the prophets included) to come and speak with him at any time whatsoever, in this way presenting Ibn 'ArabT as a signorial precursor to such European visionaries as William Blake and Immanuel Swedenborg.57 Later sufls also claimed such grand visionary abilities, often as a means of showing divine favour. A mid-nineteenth century echo of Ibn 'ArabT's celebrated youthful encounter with the souls of the prophets is found in the autobiographic ramblings of the great Iranian sufT, SafT 'AlT Shah (c. 1835-1899 AD). Describing a retreat (child) he performed as a young man, this ShT'T sufT claimed to have first encountered Husayn before noticing the assembled spirits of all of the prophets and saints in the distance behind him. In this ShT'T version of the classic sufT initiatory vision, SafT was then beckoned forward by FJusayn and handed a 51 Ibn 'Arabi, The Bezels of Wisdom, trans. R. W. J.

The founder of the school, Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'l (d.1826 AD), described his dream encounters with the imams in considerable detail, his use of the classic terminology of unveiling (kashf) gave his followers their alternative title of the Kashfiyya.59 Such accounts of visionary encounters were therefore not merely a matter of the aggrandisement of memory and commemoration. For visionary interviews with past (and indeed pre-eternal) luminaries were of great epistemological importance in an historical sense, in that they formed a way in which the people and knowledge of the past could be reclaimed and re-figured to play a role in the present. In defiance of the strictures and fragility of written knowledge, when the souls of the sages of time-past could turn up at any time for a lesson unmediated by the written word such visionary meetings overrode the need to worry about the desecrated libraries and the lost knowledge of the ancients. Such visions provided a means of avoiding the mediation of the written word through bringing the dead into the speaking presence of the living. In this they reflected a more general epistemological suspicion of written knowledge in Islam that was manifested elsewhere in the "recorded conversations" (malfuzdt) of Indian sufls and the emphasis on the oral qualities of the Qur'an itself.60 Visionary encounters created literature as well as circumvented the epistemological need for it. The most important of all Ibn 'ArabT's many visionary experiences were those that he claimed had brought about his own major written works. He claimed that prophetic visions brought about the writing of his vast Futuhdt al-makkiyya as well as the shorter Fusiis al-hikam, the redaction which he made of the Futuhdt to the gratitude of subsequent generations. These texts Ibn 'ArabT described as being composed not by himself but by divine dictation (imla1 ildhi) which occurred as the result of a series of visionary encounters with the Prophet Muhammad undergone during a period of residence in the holy city.61 Ibn 'ArabT's claim to be a kind of secretary to the Prophet is certainly not contradicted by the extraordinary scope, lucid complexity and sheer unrelenting volume of the Futuhdt, a text that few since have fully read and perhaps none digested in all of its splendours. But in its close resemblance to the prophetic experience of Muhammad himself, it was a claim that outraged as many as it impressed. Here visions were seen as tearing away at the divine order that separated ordinary men from prophets and indeed God himself. To his enemies, however, the visions of Ibn 'ArabT were not revelatory but delusional and heretical. Nevertheless, many later sufls regarded Ibn 'ArabT's visionary life as a central part of his mission and sufls continued to place visionary experience at the centre of their theorising works of mysticism. Working in the tradition of Ibn 'ArabT, the later 'Abd al-Karlm al Jlll (d. between 1406 and 1417 AD) discussed dreams and visions in his Insdn al-kdmil.62 In 58 These reminiscences have been published in M.

Despite such controversies, other sufis even claimed similar inspiration as that of Ibn 'Arabi for their own works, even in the case of such minor treatises as the Qudsiyya of'Ala' al-Dawlah al-Simnani (d.1336 AD).64 In the same way dreams occasionally played a role as cultural mediators, as when Dara Shikuh attested to having been inspired to patronise a new translation of the Yoga Vasishtha in a dream of the Hindu sage Ramacandra in which the latter embraced him and fed him with sweets.65 But such positive visionary inspiration notwithstanding, a dream or vision could also at times stand directly in the way of literary composition. At Abarquh in 1281, for example, the Prophet appeared in a dream to warn 'Aziz Nasafl (d. between 1281 and 1300 AD) to delay the writing of the remaining chapters of his KashJ al-haqd'iq for another two decades.66 Uways al-Qaranr and Visionary Initiations Theories of visions were not limited to the central Islamic lands and the school of Najm al-din Kubra (d.1221 AD) added to the development of the sufi technics of vision in the eastern Islamic world. Working in Najm al-dln's tradition, 'Ala' al-Dawlah al-Simnani also wrote a treatise on visions adapted to the principles and practices of the Kubrawl order.67 Simnanl's treatise reminds us of the practical aspects of the visionary life in Islam, the way in which visions were actively sought through the performance of specific meditative and ritual practices. SimnanI recommended a dhikr consisting of the silent repetition of the credal formula 'There is no god other than God' before sunrise and after sunset.68 According to SimnanI, diligence in this practice would introduce the mystic to the witnessing of a progression of coloured lights that herald the onset of the stiffs visionary career. Originally confined to Central Asia, the Kubrawi school to which SimnanI contributed so greatly was also important for its adaptation and transmission of the tradition of the "path of the Uwaysis" (tariqa-e-uwaysiyan).69 This tradition was named after the mysterious Uways al-Qarani, the reputed friend of the Prophet Muhammad from Yaman who had reputedly only communicated with him through visions and telepathy.70 Uways had been 63 Ibid., p. 105. 64 See J.

However, in his description of the different sects of the sufis HujwTrl did not make any reference to any tradition named after Uways at this time.71 In truth, Uways was to lend his name to the denomination of a style rather than an actual school of sufism. Such sufis claimed to have been initiated into the mystical path not through the more usual and mundane mode of clasping the hand of a living master but through the means of a visionary initiatory encounter. Usually this visionary initiation would be with the enigmatic green-man of Islam al-Khidr or else with the Prophet himself.72 Two no lesser figures than Ibn 'Arabi and the great Indian Naqshbandi sufi Ahmad Sirhindl (d.1624 AD) claimed initiations this kind.73 However perhaps the richest single source of Uwaysl visionary narratives is the collection written in eastern Turkestan around the year 1600 by Ahmad of Uzgan in his Tadhkirah-ye-bughra khani.74 In this visionary history we hear of an Afghan greengrocer who is given mystical instructions by the prophet Isma'il, a Tajik perfumer who has terrifying encounters with dragons, and an elderly scholar called Nizam al-din whose devotion to God brings about visions of the prophet Da'ud in which he is taught to sing in rapture as beautifully as the writer of the Psalms himself. This kind of Uwaysl initiatory vision was widespread if not common. Far from the territory and time of the Tadhkirah-ye-bughra khani, the North African sufi 'Abd al- 'Aziz ibn al-Dabbagh was initiated by a vision of Khidr at the tomb of the jurist and sufi Abu'l Hasan ibn al-Hirzihim (d.i 164 AD) in Fas in 1713.75 Uwaysl mysticism could certainly prove subversive in enabling ambitious mystics to claim a grand initiation while side-stepping the usual institutionalised methods of entry into Islamic mystical discourse through the membership of a recognised order (tariqa) and under the restraining guidance of a living master. Encounters with Uways could also have political dimensions, as when the emerging ruler of the Dakan 'Ala' al-din Hasan Bahman Shah (1347-1358 AD) was encouraged by Uways in a dream to take up arms against his rival Muhammad bin Tughluq.76 But such was the prestige of visionary encounters that visionary initiations became at times an acceptable if marginal aspect of sufi experience. Nonetheless, limits needed to be set and the Syrian Naqshbandi master 'Abd al-Ghanl al-NabulusI (d.1731) issued a legal ruling that visionary initiations were only acceptable so long as their content was not at variance with shari'a?1 For the most part, however, the Uwaysl tradition became absorbed into the broader stream of institutional sufism and the bounds of imagination were in this way restrained by a variety of checks and balances. These were later seen among Persian and Indian sufi groups in the prominence given to telepathic communication between a disciple and his living master, who could always recant on any outrageous claims he was said to have made to his follower 71 See Hujwiri (1999), pp. 83-84. 72 On such encounters with Khidr, see P.

Since the Tughluq ruler died before 'Ala' al-din could meet him in battle, Uways may also here have played a role in protecting the martial reputation of the new ruler. 77 See Katz (1996), p. 220 and Kinberg (1994), pp. 36-37.</page><page sequence="15">The Religious and Cultural Roles of Dreams and Visions in Islam 301 in a vision or dream.78 Nonetheless, initiatory dreams, whether in the institutionalised form of investiture by an aspirant's living master or in the less controlled form of investiture by such figures as Khidr and the Prophet, have continued to be an important theme of Muslim spirituality through to the present day.79 Aftab-e-dakan, a modern Urdu hagiography of the sufTs of Awrangabad, describes the visionary initiation of Shihab al-din the first sajjada nashin of one of the city's shrines. In the vision, Mu'ln al-din Chishti appeared on a throne before Sayyid Shihab al-din at his shrine in Ajmer before Khidr arrived on horseback to carry Shihab al-din across India to the Dakan where he was delivered into the service of Shah Nur HammamT (d.1692 AD).80 Dreams, Visions and Historiography Accounts of clairvoyant dreams and visions also featured in works of a non-religious nature and often played an important role in Arabic and Persian historiography. Just as today the idea of meaningful dreams seems altogether less troubling a thought than the voice of an invisible God booming in our right ear, so for the city-dwelling beau monde of the 'Abbasid empire was the idea of dream analysis an enjoyable middle-point between frivolous entertainment and the really frightening existential issues of revelation. Dream interpretation (ta (bir) became a subject of great popularity in the sophisticated circles of the 'Abbasid court in Baghdad and its popularity brought about the creation of circles of expert interpreters. The great 'Abbasid historians al-Taban (d.923 AD) and al-Mas'udT (d.956 AD) recorded such narratives, as did biographical works relating to all classes of people.81 In these historical works, dreams at times clearly serve the purpose of flattering some rulers and besmirching the memory of others. Mas'udT recounts the dream in which Harun al-RashTd (786-809 AD) saw two branches of a tree given to him and his brother, al HadT (785-786 AD).82 While Hariin's branch flourished, that of his brother bore only few leaves, an image which the royal physician Ibn Ishaq al-SaymarT needlessly explained as referring to the relative success and longevity of their reigns. In a later caliphal dream, the earlier ruler al-Mutawakkil (847?861 AD) is seen burning in the flames.83 More interesting is another dream of Harun al-RashTd in which he is commanded by the Prophet to free Musa ibn Ja'far from prison during the same night that the latter has a dream of the Prophet promising his freedom.84 Here a dream narrative may clear the name of one person while intimating the piety of another. Yet as a historian in particular, Mas'udT is also of interest for 78 This was especially the case with Naqshbandi sufis, whose founder had also been an Uwaysl.

The origins of the pro-'Alid policies of al-Mu'tadid (892-902 AD), for example, are explained through reference to a dream of'AlT himself warning the caliph from persecuting his descendants.85 Clearly, there is little originality in the dream stories recounted by Mas'udT and one dream narrative in particular reflects imagery surrounding the birth of prophets and saints as found in the hagiographical and folkloric traditions of various cultures. In this narrative Salamah, the Berber slave-girl who was the mother of al-Mansur (754?775 AD), dreamt during her pregnancy of a lion emerging from her side. Crouching, and then roaring with its tail beating ominously on the ground, it was presently surrounded by other lions who reverently bowed their heads before it.86 In a Persian literary context the connections between dreaming and kingship were demonstrated in as early a work as the Shahnama of FirdawsT (d.1020 AD), when for example the poet recounted Zuhak's nightmare of being dragged through the streets and beaten with an ox-headed mace and Sam's dream of finding his son Zal. Persian prose historians were no less keen to record royal dreams. One of the most interesting of all such royal dreams occurred several centuries after FirdawsT and was recounted by the Persian chronicler of the Saljuqs of Rum Ibn BTbT (d. after 1284 AD). Ibn BTbT describes how during his imprisonment his royal patron 'Ala' al-dm Kay Qubad (1219-1237 AD) had dreamt of a mysterious shaykh on the night before he was unexpectedly released. But this was not merely a historian's reworking of Mas'udT's story of the dream of Musa ibn Ja'far and the element of wonder in Ibn BTbT's story features rather in the moment of Kay Qubad's meeting with the great sufT Abu Hafs 'Umar SuhrawardT (d.1234 AD), who was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Saljuq capital at Quniyah by the 'Abbasid caliph al-Nasir (1180?1225 AD). For in a marvellous crossover of courtly and sufT imagery, it was only upon meeting SuhrawardT and his entourage outside the walls of the city that Kay Qubad recognised the shaykh as the dream figure who had appeared to him to presage the throwing off of his bonds.87 However, insight into the roles of women as dreamers and clairvoyants is also sometimes given in Persian historical works. The mother of Ibn BTbT, BTbT Munajama, was one such fortune-teller from NTshapur whose extraordinary prognosticating gifts enabled her to become a royal adviser and secure her son's fortunes at court.88 Another Persian historian, Zayn al-dm WasafT (d. after 1551 AD), tells us that a less fortunate woman rose from the city slums to have a similar if short-lived role in TTmurid Harat. After considerable and lucrative success among the TTmurid aristocrats of the city, WasafT explains how BTbT RushanayT was eventually revealed as a fraud when Harat's wise new Uzbik rulers (who were also kind enough to patronise his work) quickly saw through her ventriloquistic 'trances'. The scorching embarrassment of the many aristocrats she had gulled soon ensured that she was hanged in public for her crimes.89 Here we see how stories of fortune-telling 85 Ibid., p. 366. 86 Ibid., p. 21.

Nevertheless, grandees continued to publicise their dream lives and place great weight on their correct interpretation, a royal duty which was at times emphasised in the genre of the Mirror for Princes. In the anonymous twelfth-century Bahr al-fawa'id, for example, princely readers are instructed on some of the basic themes of oneirocriticism, illustrated with reference to the caliph 'Umar's dream of the sun and moon fighting.90 The text is also interesting for its discussion of inconsistencies in the experience of time in different kinds of dream. Reflecting these royal interests, one sixteenth-century Ottoman miniature subsequently depicts a grave faced sultan describing his dreams to his vizier and other close advisers.91 In the same period, the dreams of Shaykh Safl al-din of Ardabll (d.1334 AD) became an important feature of Safawid historical writings.92 The dreams of the founder of the family dynasty were capable of encoding political claims to legitimate rule into signs of divine blessing and approval. These dream narratives formed a rhetoric that was made all the more powerful by the fact that Safl al-dln's shrine acted both as a nationwide centre for pilgrimage and, in the manner of a mountain-ringed Versailles, as a seasonal courtly retreat. Dream narratives and the imposing architecture of sainthood might in this way work together to deter wayward courtiers from thoughts of conspiracy. In a similar manner, dream narratives might also be used to justify certain policies. In Zafar al-walih, for example, the historian al-Makkl recorded Sultan Buhlul Lodl's claim of seeing the great Dihli sufi Qutb al-din Bakhtiyar Kakl (d.1235 AD) in a dream encouraging him to wage war against the Sharql sultan of Jawnpur.93 Such dreams and visions were clearly by no means the preserve of contemplative sufi purveyors of miracle and magic. As though to reinforce the point, autobiographical material also survives which shows that the importance lent to dreams was common to both men of action and rationalising religious reformers. In one sixteenth-century set of memoirs, an Indo-Afghan soldier recorded his own vivid dream life. It is a document that provides a direct insight into the inner world of a career warrior from the frontier in a way that modern European scholars reconstructing the mental world of Italian millers of the same period could indeed only dream of.94 However, it is in the autobiography of the first Mughal emperor Babur (r. 1526-30 AD) that one of the most closely observed of all dream narratives in Muslim historiographical or autobiographical works appears. The dream occurred in the year 1500-1, as Babur sought to conquer Samarqand early in his career. The account deserves to speak for itself. About that time I had a strange dream. I dreamed Khwaja Ubaydullah [Ahrar] had arrived and I had gone out to greet him. He came and sat down. The tablecloth must have been laid somewhat 90 See J. S.

Mullah Baba looked at me and motioned. I motioned back as if to say, 'It's not my fault. The steward is to blame'. The khwaja understood and accepted this apology. Then he rose and I rose to escort him. In the entryway he took me by the arm, the right or the left, I don't remember which, and lifted me so that one of me feet was off the ground. In Turkish he said, 'Shaykh Maslahat berdi [Shaykh Maslahat has bestowed].' A few days later I took Samarqand.95 Here we see the hold of the NaqshbandT saints even over the imagination of one of the greatest warriors and statesmen in history. For the great NaqshbandT saints of Central Asia were as close to Babur's heart as they were to that of his own father and those of his descendants in India. As the great age of the Muslim empires was drawing to a close, in nineteenth-century DihlT one of the last Mughal princes put forward a theory of the special relationship between kingship and visionary capacity.96 MTrza 'AlT AzfarT' re-worked the claim for the supernatural qualities of the TTmurid house that had been presented three centuries earlier in Abu'l Fadl's Akbarnama. According to AzfarT, as the heirs of TTmur (nasl-e-timuriyya) the Mughal househould had a special affinity for the clairvoyant dream and vision (rWyd-e-sddiq). As a minor prince himself, AzfarT (d. 1818/19 AD) appears in his autobiography as someone proud of his own premonitory dreams, such as that in which he foresaw the exact details of the shrine of Mu'Tn al-dm ChishtT at Ajmer prior to going there on pilgrimage. But in accordance with his genealogical theory of the supernatural, he blamed his own limited powers on the fact that his father had taken a wife who did not possess even a drop of TTmurid blood in her veins. In interpreting a dream of the Hindu goddess LakshmT, this fact also enabled him to explain to readers the all too apparent lack of political success in his own career. Dreams, then, could console and exonerate the unsuccessful no less effectively than they could reinforce the achievements of those who had attained political eminence. Yet such theories did not merely represent the idiosyncrasies of a disappearing royal elite. Despite all of the epistemic ruptures of the colonial experience, in the reformist climate of northern India, a generation later, the great Islamic modernist Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (d.1898 AD) wrote a book devoted to his own dream life. In this work, like others before him, he confessed that many of his most important actions had been provoked by dreams.97 Visionary Diarists Despite the wealth of such material concerning princes to be found in historical and biographical writings, it is nonetheless sufT biographies that remain the richest sources of visionary narratives. While some of the earlier sufT writers like SulamT (d.1021 AD) had been happy to record the visions of other sufTs, there were also those sufTs for whom their 95 Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur, The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor, trans, and ed.

This was not, as in the case of Ibn 'Arabi, a literature revealed by vision as such but rather one which sought to describe the contents of actual visions. The precise role of such texts in sufi life is uncertain. It seems possible that as with the visionary treatises of Suhrawardl, these accounts may have been seen as a means of teaching a stiffs disciples about the nature of visions. A hermeneutical lesson based on the interpretation of the meanings of a visionary narrative might in this way teach the novice to interpret his own private dreams and visions as part of the central sufi obligation of spiritual self-reckoning (muhasib). Here we see the inherent ambiguity of such texts in promoting the notion of visionary experience itself while at the same time creating a blueprint of powerful images that might recur in the novice's own visionary life. Vision and text, imagination and tradition, were in such ways frequently interlinked. However, it also seems likely that the content of these visions was to be seen as a kind of revelatory unveiling (futuh, kashf or shuhud) in its own right. Since the sufi saints were regarded as the heirs of the Prophet in a chronological, initiatory and ontological sense, the stuff of their visions represented a continuum with the revelation of the Qur'an itself. In its variously contested configuration, the relationship between prophet and saint also plotted out the relationship between the revelation of Muhammad and the visions of the sufi masters. The earliest example of the sufi autobiographical dream narration is perhaps the Bad' sha}n of al-Haklm al-Tirmidhl (d.c.908 AD).98 In this work, Tirmidhl describes not only the content of his own dreams but also those of his wife, whom he clearly regarded as in some sense his own instructor. For the dreams of Tirmidhl's unnamed wife were directed towards the spiritual education of her husband as much as the edification of her own soul. At one point in Tirmidhl's career, his wife kept dreaming of him just before the dawn and so came to be the medium of teachings sent for him by spiritual beings in the other world. In one such dream she saw Tirmidhl sitting with his two sisters with his feet dangling in a pool of crystal clear spring water. As Tirmidhl sat eating clear white grapes, a man (in fact an angel) appeared and drew him aside before instructing him about the meaning of divine justice and the cultivation of piety, likened to the growing of myrtle. In another uxorial dream, Khidr makes an appearance to teach Tirmidhl to behave justly towards his enemies. Persian literature also had its own tradition of dream diarists. Indeed, the Kashf al-asm r of Ruzbihan Baqll of Shiraz (d.1209 AD) is one of the most celebrated of all the visionary autobiographies of the sufis.99 Kashf al-asrar forms an extraordinary journal that details its author's visionary encounters with all manner of human and celestial beings. Perhaps appropriately for someone hailing from the home city of the Shiraz grape, Kashf al-asrar includes descriptions of intoxicating mystical wine-drinking sessions as well as the poetic symbolism of divine showers of pearls and white roses. There are visions of vast celestial deserts where Ruzbihan encounters God in the form of a handsome Turk who reaches for a lute to play such soulful music that Ruzbihan's heart swells with unbearable love. 98 For an annotated translation, see B.

Indeed, the Fuyud al-haramayn of Shah WalT Allah is one of the most notable of all Muslim visionary texts as well as one of the most important contributions of South Asian Islam to Arabic literature. In Fuyud al-haramayn a terrestrial journey is seen to prefigure a more celestial visionary itinerary that is pursued during a pilgrimage to the holy cities of Makkah and MadTnah. In the text WalT Allah described no fewer than forty-six visions that, like Ibn 'ArabT before him, he received during his stay in the holy cities.101 One of the most interesting aspects of such texts as that of Shah WalT Allah is the interplay which they propose between the experience of travel (especially pilgrimage) and parallel sets of visionary experiences relating to locations visited on a journey. Such sufTs were undoubtedly people who knew how to get the most out of their holidays. More colourful than the somewhat orthodox visions of Shah WalT Allah were the earlier apparitions witnessed by another such contributor to sufT visionary literature in Arabic, the fifteenth-century Algerian Muhammad al-ZawawT (d.1477 AD). In suggesting that a journey to the east is the most auspicious time for visions, dream diaries such as that of al-ZawawT form a kind of home-grown and anti-Orientalist version of such later European visionary journeys to the Levant as the Voyage en Orient of Gerard de Nerval. For among the hundred and nine visionary encounters described in al-ZawawT's journal, their most intense and fertile period comes during a seven month visit to Egypt in which al-ZawawT found his visions to be drawn from a sublimated encounter with the physical places he visited. Of course there are important differences with Nerval, not least in that al-ZawawT seems to have really completed the actual journey he described. Another important difference is that al-ZawawT's favoured places for visions were amid a sacred Muslim (rather than pharaonic) geography that was to be found among the many tombs of early sufTs and other religious figures lying in Cairo's enormous medieval necropolis of al-Qarafah. In one dream, two dead sufT shaykhs appeared to al-ZawawT whom he then tried to browbeat into bestowing upon him the Robe of Perfection. Since they adamantly refused, al-ZawawT went to visit another tomb and sat crying beside it. Eventually the long dead Alexandrian sufT Ibn 'Ata' Allah (d.1309 AD) appeared and asked him why he was crying. When al-ZawawT explained, Ibn 'Ata' Allah also refused him the Robe, but since al-ZawawT went on crying he offered him the Garment of Perfection instead. Having travelled the length of the Sahara, al-ZawawT was hard to satisfy and he and Ibn 'Ata' Allah bartered for a while, but when the latter explained that the Garment did not only bestow the ability to walk on water and fly in the air but also came with the power to make the sultan of Egypt hand out four thousand gold dinars, al-ZawawT eventually agreed. 100 See H.

These included the dream letters of the Balkan female Ottoman dervish, 'Ashiyah Khatun of Uskiib (^.1641-43 AD) as well as the more extensive dream diary of Niyazl-e Misrl (d.1694 AD). In his extraordinary prison notebooks, NiyazI-e-MisrI recorded all manner of esoteric encounters, including a series of angelic lectures in which Jabra'il explained to him, in Turkish, the secrets of the science of letter divination (jqfr).U)2 Visionary Geographies Al-Zawawl was far from unique in demanding the visionary appearance of those saints whose tombs he had come to visit and other pilgrims were sometimes given advice by their sufi instructors on the best ways of ensuring a vision of a chosen saint. Another assiduous visitor to the great Cairene necropolis of al-Qarafah was 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Sha'ranl (d.1565 AD), whose Lata'ijal-minan is also replete with tombside visionary episodes.103 But like the highly popular pilgrimage guidebooks to al-Qarafah, Sha'ranI also offered advice to those seeking visionary encounters with the necropolis's thousands of deceased inhabitants.104 Sha'ranI advised, for example, that since the dead saints still travel around a great deal, certain days of the week are the best for catching them at their mausolea; Abu'l 'Abbas al-MursI (d.1287 AD) thus tended only to be in residence at his shrine before sunrise on a Saturday. Similar kinds of advice also filtered into the folklore of the Muslim world and in northern India, as elsewhere, it was customary for visitors to clap their hands before entering a shrine so as to alert the saint to their presence. The annoyance caused by disturbing a saint or catching him unawares was believed to lead to that least welcome form of visionary visitation in the form of haunting.105 Persian sufis also encouraged such customs and 'Aziz Nasafl (d. between 1281 and 1300 AD) was only one among many to give advice on summoning dead shaykhs from their tombs. In describing a technique well-known throughout the Muslim world, in his al-Insdn al-kamil Nasafl directed the pilgrim to circumambulate the tomb while concentrating on clearing his mind and purifying his heart.106 However, in Kashkul-e-katimi, Shah Kallm Allah of Dihll (d.1729 AD) instead recommended a special graveside dhikr (dhikr-e-kashf-e-qubur) as the best means of revealing to its practitioner, in a dream, the soul of the deceased master beside whose tomb it was performed.107 Another practice for ensuring a visionary encounter with a saint or prophet was known as istikharah, the custom of sleeping in tombs in order 102 See D. Terzioglu, "Man in the Image of God in the Image of the Times: Sufi Self-Narratives and the Diary of Niyazi-e-Misri (1618-94)", Studia Islamica 94 (2002), p. 157. 103 Trimingham (1971), pp. 220-225.

The Prophet himself had advised on the way of performing a basic version of this practice, though without any reference to the time or place of performance. Nevertheless, the practice of associating namaz al-istikharah with specific places certainly developed and was especially common in the Maghrib. Abu 'Abd Allah al-Zubayrl is said to have written an entire book on the subject of istikharah. Similar practices, along with a whole host of other occult procedures, were famously compiled in the Jawahir-e-khamsah of the Indian sufi, Muhammad Ghawth Gwallarl (d. 1562-3 AD), whose own mausoleum is one of the most magnificent in the subcontinent.109 Some shrines were famous as places to encounter visionary beings with or without specific practices to summon them. The great necropolis at Makll ('the little Makkah') in Sind is one such place, famous for the visionary appearance there of the Prophet and his grandsons as well as the many saints interred there. This special quality was celebrated by Mir 'All Shir Qanl' in the Jilawgah-e-imam, where Makll was eulogised as "a paradise on earth... the visiting place of the men of God".110 In Morocco, however, it is the shrine of the king of the jinn, Sldl Shamharush, in the foothills of the Atlas that is most famous for the visions witnessed by its pilgrims, including visions of Sldl Shamharush himself leading his armies of followers drawn from the jinn.lu In Iran, it is arguably the shrine of Shah Ni'mat Allah Wall (d.1431 AD) that has acted as the most active centre of sufi pilgrimage in recent centuries. Among the reminiscences of Safl 'All Shah (d.1899 AD) that were mentioned earlier we find an account of one such sufi visit to the shrine at Mahan. There, amid a closely observed scene of morning tea-making and sleeping pilgrims, another dervish described seeing Shah Ni'mat Allah coming to gently wake him up from his sleep before quietly returning to the privacy of his tomb.112 Similarly, at many other shrines throughout the Muslim world believers have caught short glimpses of a saint engaged in worship, while at a less anthropomorphic level pilgrims have witnessed glowing green lights hovering above the saintly sepulchre.113 Ironically, many of the tombs and shrines which pilgrims like al-ZawawI visited were themselves the concrete residue of earlier visionary experiences. In premodern Islam, as in Christianity no less, saints and prophets appeared on a fairly regular basis to demand the building of a memorial shrine or even a complete mausoleum for themselves on a given spot. Some of the most famous and most obscure of Muslim pilgrimage sites in this way owe their existence to a particular class of dreams and visions in which a holy personage appears to demand the construction or elaboration of a shrine around their purported burial site. The great pilgrimage city of Mazar-e-Sharlf in northern Afghanistan was originally built as a 108 See T. Fahd, "bUkhara", in Eh.

As in the case of the famous patron of the Muslims of KashmTr, Sayyid 'AlT HamadanT (d.1385 AD), such dream-located tombs are in turn revered as shrines. This process demonstrates the continual interplay that existed between pilgrimage cults and hagiographical dream narratives.115 On such occasions dreams have augmented the development of rival sacred geographies, in the case of Mazar-e-Shanf positing a more local burial place for 'AlT for Afghan and Central Asian Muslims than his more famous shrine in Najaf. However, lesser known vision-shrines also dot the landscape throughout the Muslim world. Such vision-shrines (mashahid al-ru'yd) were a common feature of the landscape of medieval Syria, while many others lay in al-Qarafah and were visited by al-ZawawT and thousands of others.116 At the other end of the Islamic world, hidden behind the main mausoleum at the eighteenth-century NaqshbandT shrine known as PanchakkT in Awrangabad lies a large modern cenotaph built after Dust Muhammad, one of the Mughal soldiers who made up the original following of the saints buried there, appeared in a dream to a modern-day devotee to demand recognition of his own burial site. In ways such as these, the physical and subtle worlds were able to interact through the medium of human perception and creativity, whether expressed through architectural, literary or even ritual means. At times this traffic between the intangible world of the vision and the concrete world of the mausoleum led to the overlapping of terrestrial and visionary geographies in literary works that deliberately confused physical geography with its ethereal counterparts.117 The Dream and Vision in Hagiography The frequent interplay between dreaming and death, burial and enshrinement, meant that stories of the dreams and visions of the saints and their followers played an important role in Muslim hagiographies. Possessing such claims to truth, the leitmotif of the visionary experiences possessed a powerful rhetoric that was often exploited through its frequent featuring in sufT hagiography. On a sociological level, it is noteworthy that the memory of many of these sufTs whose visions were best known and recorded in literary form by themselves and their successors also lay at the centre of important shrine cults.118 This was the See R. D. McChesney, Waqf in Central Asia: Four Hundred Years in the History of a Muslim Shrine (Princeton, 1991). 115 See D. DeWeese, "Sayyid 'All Hamadani and Kubrawi Hagiographical Traditions", in L.

Meri, The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria (Oxford, 2002) and Taylor (1999), pp. 32?33.

As such, visionary narratives at times also entertained an element of com petition. Accounts of the life of Sayyid 'AlT HamadanT lent an especially important place to descriptions of dreams as an expression of the saint's miraculous powers.120 HamadanT's hagiographers recount how the Prophet appeared in different people's dreams to urge them to follow the saint, while HamadanT himself frequently both appeared in the dreams of others and interpreted the dreams of kings. One such royal dream predicted the saint's conversion of KashmTr to Islam, thus linking dream narratives to traditions of collective history and ethnogenesis. Such stories also proliferate in the oral traditions of South-East Asian Islam, particularly in the motif describing the conversion of a king as having been effected through a dream containing the arrival of a sufT by ship, after which the king wakes up mysteriously circumcised.121 Dream episodes feature prominently in the most famous Muslim hagiographical works. In the Tadhkirat al-awliya of'Attar (d.c.1221 AD), for example, the Prophet appears in a dream to chastise a self-satisfied follower of Dhu'l Nun MisrT (d.861 AD), while a follower of the deceased Ma'ruf KarkhT (d.815 AD) dreamed of seeing his master standing stupefied with love beneath the throne of God.122 In the great Nafahat al-uns, JamT (d.1492 AD) describes a dream of'Ayn al-Zaman Jamal al-dm GTlT, one of the disciples of Najm al-dm Kubra, that hints at the same epistemological weighing of visionary experience versus book-learning that we have discussed earlier.123 Before setting off to seek out his master, GTlT packed several books on logic ((aql) and tradition (naql) to accompany him on his journey. When near to Najm al-dm s centre at Khwarazm, GTlT had a dream in which he was told to throw away his travel bag. On waking, GTlT felt puzzled since he felt he was not carrying any possessions with him and it took two more dreams containing Najm al-dm, in the second of which the exasperated master spelt the matter out for him, for GTlT to realise that the dreams referred to his sack of books. This time, GTlT promptly threw the books into the river Bactrus, for which act Najm al-dm invested him with his sufT robe (khirqah). Among the many other accounts of dreams and visions in the same work, JamT also describes a vision seen by another KubrawT sufT, Sa'd al-dm HamawT, of the Prophet coming to attend a sufT musical gathering (majlis-e-sama ?) .124 The others present at the gathering saw Sa'd al-dm standing with great propriety as he stared at the empty bench on which he saw Muhammad seated.

Visions, then, affect religious practice in the human sphere, just as the Prophet himself had been instructed in the performance of the ritual prayers by a vision of the angel Jabra'il engaged in worship. Stories surrounding popular saint cults with shared Muslim and Hindu congregations also frequently involve visionary or oneiric episodes, often at the same time invoking legends concerning earlier kings and emperors. Royal dreams thus feature in the Bengali tradition of the legendary Satya Pir, while in the Dakan the Mughal emperor Awrangzeb and his vizier are initiated into the world of the vision in stories that are still recounted in the oral tradition of Shah Nur HammamI (d.1692 AD).127 In some South Asian texts, Muslim saints are seen to be able to commit the greatest of all visionary accomplishments, that of shape-shifting into another form. Here it is onlookers who partake in the vision, if such it is rightly considered. There exist many such accounts of sufis transforming themselves into tigers and lions, a motif which has also found rich expression in the folklore of South Asia. However, literary versions of the motif also exist and one Persian hagiography from the eighteenth-century Dakan describes thieves sneaking into the tent of the sleeping sufi master, Shah Palangposh (d. 1699 AD) only to be chased out screaming as they see the sufi transform himself into "a wild tiger with eyes popping like a peacock's".128 Conclusions Although most of our examples have been drawn from the past, the recounting of visions and dreams has continued to be an important aspect of Muslim religiosity. This is by no means limited to the sufi groups that continue to flourish throughout the Muslim world and dreams have even played roles amid the discourse of Muslim reform.129 In a different context of political reform, early twentieth-century Iraqi writers developed the genre of the rufyd as a means of portraying Utopias of social and political justice in their promotion of a programme of Iraqi national cultural revival.130 More recently, the Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk has intricately assembled traditional Muslim theories of the dream and vision as the framework for his novel Kara Kitap, while Swahili manuals of dream interpretation For details of visionary episodes in medieval and modern South Asian Muslim hagiography, see respectively B.

Evidently, these continued roles of imaginative experience in no way impinge upon the modernity of the societies in which they are found.132 For scholars one useful aspect of recent attempts to understand the cultural framework of the imagination in Islam is the way in which it allows us to treat premodern Muslim visionary narratives in the neutral ground of what used simply to be called suspended disbelief. But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the study of Muslim dream and visionary traditions is the way in which they alert us to the different roles played by the imagination in formulating the diverse ways in which believers broadened the boundaries of what it means to be Muslim. Whether recounted by hagiographers, historians or autobiographers, the character of visionary experiences was often altered for specific ends when experience itself came to be mutated into literary form. But in all of their diversity, in such writings we can clearly make out the different social, cultural and political uses towards which accounts of dreams and visions have been directed. Aside from Piers Plowman and the poetry of William Blake, the most famous visionary episodes in English literature are probably those related to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas de Quincey. Such opium fantasies also played a considerable role in Muslim cultural history. Both opium and the various preparations of cannabis (as bhang in South Asia or majnun in North Africa) were a central element of the practices of the qalandariyyah, for example.133 Medieval maljuzat texts from the circle of Nizam al-din Awliya (d.1325 AD) in Dihll show how qalandars often flaunted the usage of such drugs to the displeasure of their more sober colleagues. In the secular sphere, the famous painting ofjahangir's boon companion 'Inayat Khan dying from the ravages of opium and the popular medieval Arabic sub-genre of humorous tales describing the picaresque adventures of the eaters of hashish both remind us of the undoubted contributions of such less respectable visionaries to the arts of Islam.135 The exploration of this subject, however, must fall beyond the remit of this article. To the cultural historian, oneirocritical and visionary texts reveal the ways in which a discourse on the imagination finds expression in different historical contexts. Yet beneath each of the uses to which visionary narratives have been put, below each entrapment of the 131 Orhan Pamuk, The Black Book, trans. G. Gun (London, 1996). 13 See e.g. K. P.

Often there is an unquestionably universal quality to such experiences, tropes and images that will be as familiar to the scholar of Buddhism as of Christianity. The monastic chronicle ofjocelin of Brakelond (d.c.1202 AD) recounts how at the time of the election of the new abbot in 1182 the worried monks of Bury St Edmunds were haunted by all manner of portentous dreams.136 Each morning new accounts of these dreams spread around the cloisters and one monk even reported seeing the broken body of St Edmund himself rise from his tomb amid all of the disquiet of the abbey. Through the shared qualities of the dreams of the monks of Bury and the visions of the likes of Ruzbihan BaqlT, the freshness of such glimpses into another soul ultimately serves to remind us of the living individual humanity of the past. 136 Jocelin of Brakelond, Chronicle of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds, trans.
