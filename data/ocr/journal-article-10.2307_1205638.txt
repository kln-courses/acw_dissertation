Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1994. 452 pp. $49.50 (cloth). This meticulously researched, erudite, and densely written book offers a novel interpretation of the Jewish mystical tradition on the basis of an outstanding fa- miliarity with the primary sources (most of which are still extant in manuscript) and an unusually sensitive reading of texts. Elliot Wolfson challenges the reader to discard the "commonplace characterization of Jewish thought as auditory as opposed to Greek which is visual" (p. 50) and instead realize that the Jewish mystical tradition was based "on the tension of aniconism, on the one hand, and visualizing the deity, on the other hand" (p. 5). Although the prohibition on graven images resulted in the lack of a "fixed iconic representation of the deity," the biblical belief that God was present in the Temple, seated on the Cherubim, "provided the context for the visualization of the divine presence" in subsequent generations (p. 17). The tension between the normative aniconism of the Jewish tradition and the powerful longing of the mystic to visualize the enthroned Glory gave rise to complex mystical speculations. The visualization of God, moreover, served "as an exegetical basis for certain mythic ideas" (p. 8). By virtue of the imagination, the Jewish mystics reexperienced the Sinaitic theophany, endowed the received textual tradition with new meanings, and expressed their homo- erotic longing to the invisible male God. Thus, the visualization of God in mystical contemplation both validated the authoritative tradition and subverted its pre- sumed antimythical and anti-anthropomorphic posture. In an attempt to avoid the pitfalls of either relativism or essentialism in the interpretation of religious experience, Wolfson presents his methodology as "modified contextualism" (p. 54). On the one hand, he justly refuses to treat Jewish mysticism as a monolithic phenomenon, insisting instead on the diversity of this evolving tradition. But on the other, he rejects attempts to reduce Jewish mysticism to historical constructs. Believing in the "irreducibility of the numi- nous," Wolfson endorses Mircea Eliade's structuralism, according to which the "knowledge of structure makes it possible to understand meaning" (p. 54). Ac- cordingly, he attempts to uncover the unifying structure of the Jewish mystical tradition, namely, the intrinsic link between myth, visualization of God, and her- meneutics. But since Wolfson grants history a role in fashioning the mystical ex- perience itself, he arranges the chapters in a chronological order, from the Bible and apocalyptic literature, through the Hekhalot literature and rabbinic Mid- rashim, to medieval Neoplatonic philosophy, German Pietism, and the Kabbalah of Provence and Spain. The result is the first comprehensive reconstruction of the poetics of visualizing God in Judaism that disregards traditional disciplinary boundaries between Kabbalah, philosophy, and poetry. Mastering all three disci- plines, Wolfson shows, for example, that philosophic analysis of prophecy shaped mystical speculations and practices and that religious poetry expressed themes commonly found in philosophical or mystical texts. His reconstruction provides some of the "missing links" in the history of the Jewish mystical tradition, espe- cially during the early Middle Ages, illustrating both continuity and change. On the phenomenological level, the central argument of this book is that "the primary function of the imagination is hermeneutical ... the imagination pro- duces symbols of the spiritual entities that act as interpretative filtering screens through which these entities appear in human consciousness" (p. 62). The mental 506</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews images function as the prism through which the personal God is "visualized in concrete and at times intensely mythical terms" (p. 67). Though Jewish mystics understood the status of mental images in a variety of ways, they all shared the notion that the image is neither totally corporeal nor totally spiritual, neither a subjective hallucination nor an objective perception. Rather, it is the coalescence of "spirit and matter," (p. 65) which Wolfson labels as "docetism." This label rightly suggests that Jewish mysticism should be studied in light of the Christian doctrine of incarnation or the iconoclastic debates in the Eastern Church. And indeed Wolfson has done well to study Jewish mysticism comparatively and cross- culturally in light of Christianity as well as Islam. Yet it is doubtful that the term "docetism" properly captures the status of the mental images in the Jewish mysti- cal tradition as Wolfson analyzes it. After all, for Wolfson, "docetism" does not denote the apparition-like quality of extramental, physical events (as it was for the original Docetists) but rather the seemingly corporeal features of mental im- ages that have a spiritual entity as their objective correlative. The term "doce- tism," therefore, does not explain how a spiritual reality is symbolically corpore- alized through the sensory image, how the image functions as an internal icon (as in German Pietism), or how the image can release mental energy that could affect either mystical or theurgic results (as in medieval Kabbalah). Regrettably, Wolfson employs the term "docetism" in lieu of an analysis of the psychological and epistemological assumptions that account for the hermeneutic function of the imagination. Wolfson states that the imagination is "a divine ele- ment in the soul," located in the heart, and in one place he even refers to the imagination as "an organ" (p. 119). But we need to know more about the place of the imagination in the hierarchy of psychic powers, the relationship of the imagination to the body, the function of the imagination in perception and in knowledge. It is the Greek ocular model of knowledge which linked philosophical and mystical knowledge both to a metaphysics of light and to optical theories about both the physical properties of light and the physiology of the human eye. Wolfson is fully aware of these issues, but he does not explain how they relate to the symbolizing power of the imagination. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the imagination is an active or a passive faculty. Plato, Aristotle, and the medieval philosophers who followed them discredited the imagination as a path to truth precisely because of its creative capacity. If the Jewish mystics, by contrast, valo- rized the imagination for its creative power, Wolfson has to admit that not all mental images have an objective correlative; some are no more than hallucina- tions or expressions of unconscious content, as David Halperin maintains. Con- versely, if the Jewish mystics regarded the imagination as a passive power, a mir- ror that merely reflects or refracts the divine light, Wolfson must explain how the imagination can serve as a tool of creative hermeneutics. The most challenging claim of the book is that mystical imagination in Judaism is profoundly phallocentric. Inspired by the feminist philosopher and psychoana- lyst Luce Irigaray, Wolfson explains the twofold link between ocularcentrism and phallocentrism: first, the Jewish mystics focused their gaze on the hidden genitals of the male God, and second, the act of contemplation is itself an act of stripping away the veils that cover the divine phallus, that is, the linguistic garments of the revealed Torah. The phallic nature of mystical contemplation becomes most evident in the Zohar, the magnum opus of medieval Kabbalah, which Wolfson maintains (following Yehuda Liebes) was the product of a mystical fraternity in Castile. In his subtle analysis of Zoharic texts, Wolfson shows how Torah study is 507</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion an act of penetrating the mysteries of the Godhead, an act that could be carried out only by circumcised males, in which climax is either the ecstatic union of the male mystic with the Shekhinah, the female aspect of God, or the theurgic reunification of masculine and feminine aspects of the androgenous deity. What makes Wolfson's analysis so daring is the claim that Kabbalah is not a heterosexual myth but rather an expression of homoerotic desires, albeit ex- pressed sometimes through heterosexual imagery. The Shekhinah is not an inde- pendent feminine principle, a Jewish goddess of sorts, but the feminine aspect of a male deity, and more precisely, the feminine dimension of an "androgenous phallus." Kabbalah, Wolfson convincingly argues, operated within a one-sex the- ory (i.e., there is only one biological sex-the male-of which men are the most perfect and women are the less perfect examples), so that when Kabbalists de- picted the dynamic interaction between masculine and feminine potencies in the Godhead, they described the relationship between two gradations, one more per- fect than the other, within the same masculine deity. Ironically, though Wolfson was inspired by a feminist thinker, his analysis of the Zoharic material makes it patently clear that Kabbalah was written by men, about men, and for men and that it cannot be naively appropriated by modern Jewish feminists to express feminine spirituality. Kabbalists not only categorically excluded earthly females from mystical activity (contemplative cum hermeneuti- cal) but also directed their erotic desires toward the genitals of a male deity in whose image they were created, literally speaking. Wolfson's tantalizing analysis leaves the reader to ponder about the psychological conditions that gave rise to these homoerotic fantasies as well as about their social implications. In his por- trayal Kabbalah emerges as an elaborate (infantile?) fantasy of men who are pro- foundly obsessed with their own genitals and for whom all forms of male creativ- ity (literary and mystical) were a sublimation of sexual energy: the pen and the gaze are an extension of the penis. One is left to wonder whether these homo- erotic speculations reflect the fear of women's sexuality or rather a deep anxiety about their own masculinity, either because Jewish males were feminized by the male deity, as Howard Eilberg-Schwartz holds, or because they were reduced to a position of social inferiority by non-Jewish males. Could it be that Kabbalistic homoerotic fantasies mask social and/or personal impotence, resulting in the de- lusion that the mystic could redeem himself, society, the cosmos, and even God by virtue of his creative imagination? And if homoeroticism is so strong in Kabbalah, especially in Sefer ha-Zohar, does it tell us anything about the sexual orientation and practices of its creators? To ask these questions, however, Wolfson would have to renounce his belief in the "irreducibility of the numinous" and subject his texts not only to phenomenological analysis but also to psychological and social in- quiries. In sum, Wolfson's rich study invites all scholars to enter these fascinating and often disturbing texts and reexamine certain conventions about rabbinic Juda- ism. Though Wolfson does not say so, his illuminating study suggests that the Jewish mystics were the visual artists of the Jewish tradition. The mystics sub- verted the prohibition on graven images by visualizing God not in space but through symbolic language to which the Kabbalists among them assigned sym- bolic colors. Thus, instead of narrating the religious myth on stained-glass win- dows to be gazed by the public eye, the Jewish mystics projected their colorful visions of God onto the private screens of their imagination and communicated its meaning to the public through exegesis of canonic texts. In their creative imagination the Jewish mystics experienced the paradox ofJudaism, which Wolf- 508</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews son brings to our attention: a meditative gaze which linguistically reveals that which is concealed, making the hidden God visible.
