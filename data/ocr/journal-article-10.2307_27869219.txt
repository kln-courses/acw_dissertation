<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Armour of an Alienating Identity jeffrey jerome cohen1 and the members of interscripta" This essay examines the construction of masculinity in medieval culture. Heroism and sanctity organize the masculine body into a cultural coherence that is always both powerful and fragile. Identity in the Middle Ages depends upon an array of changing phenomena?from medical theory and manner of dress to martial activity and relation to other gendered bodies. (JJC) I %e armour of an alienating identity': this resonant phrase derives from JL the French psychoanalyst and reinterpreter of Freud, Jacques Lacan, who uses it to describe the effect of passing through the Mirror Stage.3 The young child, he writes, initially cannot draw a boundary between self and world, perceiving itself as a cacophony of limbs, a body in pieces (le corps morcel?). Then, through a gaze at its reflection or from seeing itself mimicked in the actions of another, the child gains an illusory self-identity, an integrity that is predicated upon a fundamental misrecognition: the image becomes the thing. The child dons the armour of an alienating identity (4). To play with Lacan a bit, this armour is also an amour, a desire that reaches toward a wholeness never actually present and therefore never to be obtained. We might also conceive of the armour as an armoire, a closed space, a closet, that dooms the subject through the construction of a constricting exterior to a lifelong struggle to reconcile the new' binarism inside / outside (or self / other). We are never fully the single thing we take this armour, amour, armoire to represent: the mirror stage is not a phase we pass through so much as the wooden planks upon which we enact the role of whatever character we have taken to be our essential, singular self.4 We move, then, from initial multiplicity to a deceptive integrity, an illusory oneness. This transformation of a polymorphous, disharmonious body into singularity is the same movement I stage in synthesizing this essay. What follows masquerades as the work of one author, who has given it voice, but in fact it is an arrangement of many voices into the armour of my own arthuriana 6.4 (1996) 1</page><page sequence="2">the armour of an alienating identity 2 individuating rhetoric. Interscriptais an electronic discussion group dedicated to the exploration of topics germane to contemporary medieval studies. In November and December of 1993,1 moderated through Interscripta a virtual colloquium on Medieval Masculinities.' Three hundred people around the world subscribed; fifty five of them joined the lively, disembodied conversation. In November of 1994 I organized the vast amount of text this discussion generated into a hypertext article; here I bring that polyphonic text one step closer to univocality by reducing it to Vanilla text.5 But I do not pretend that the text is mine alone. The estranging effect of this disavowal might equally well be applied to medieval masculinities in general, and perhaps especially to the heroic constructions of manhood typically encountered in Arthurian texts. For heroism is a gendered realm that mandates, quite literally, the assumption of 'the armour of an alienating identity'?helm, hauberk, gauntlets, greaves. Heroic masculinity is a cultural alignment of behaviors formulated to be adopted and promulgated?a powerful vision of masculinity that, in order to be offered as a mode of living, must also acknowledge its artificiality, its constructedness, its adoptability. Heroism organizes the masculine 'body in pieces' into a cultural coherence represented as invulnerable (because it must not fail) and always in danger of decapitation, dismemberment, and fragmentation (because no identity, predicated on a misrecognition, can hope to hold?even if that originary mistaking is a socially necessary one). Society requires heroes, so it constructs them; construction is a dangerous process, producing both embodied subjects and monsters. Society needs heroes, but it must fear them with the deepest kind of love. Theory and the body The Interscripta discussion of medieval masculinities began, auspiciously enough, on Halloween (October 31,1993), prompting the moderator to wonder about the assuming of costumes and the putting on of gender identities: As I sit at the keyboard, thinking about how best to initiate this discussion of Medieval Masculinities, I can look either at the blank spaces on my monitor, waiting for my words; or, by shifting my eyes slightly, at the quiet Cambridge street on which I live. In a few hours this street will be dark and full of children in bright, plastic costumes. Tonight is their time to be something they are not. Adults, too, will be caught up in this fantasy: many of them will join this pan American masquerade and don store-bought accoutrements to become temporarily someone else. Suppose that at the end of the night, made weary by parties and pranks and cross-dressing, this whole costumed crew comes home, takes off their disguises, and finds that underneath is not the Self they expected</page><page sequence="3">the armour of an alienating identity 3 to find, but another costume draping the body. And suppose that under this alien identity is another, perhaps stranger one; and under the next, another. Years of costumes may have built up underneath, and as each one is peeled off like onion skin, the suspicion arises that there's nothing at the center, or that the center will never be reached. (Jeffrey Jerome Cohen) The unsettling power of these images originates in their denaturalization of that chain of cause and effect which, according to a pervasive mythology of personal identity, links who we are with an immutable essence at the core of being. But how can we be so sure that this core exists, and even if it does, can we be certain of the extent to which it represents (or dictates, or even influences) the expression of who we are as sexed and gendered beings? Gender theorists have argued that the identity we unreflectively assume to be our own does not arise from some central, determinate self, but is rather a collection of behaviors, expressions, and material signifiers in which we are dressed by the cultural moment that enables our coming into being. Marjorie Garber has explored the ways in which categories like male' and 'female' can be reconfigured through the use of a few props?a wig, high heels, press-on nails, trousers6; Thomas Laqueur has shown this same instability at work historically in the description and assignment of sexual anatomy.7 Judith Butler has insisted that gender identity and its signs are performative in the sense that the essence or identity that they otherwise purport to express are fabrications manufactured and sustained through corporal signs and other discursive means. That the gendered body is performative suggests that it has no ontological status apart from the various acts which constitute its reality/8 Femininity becomes a masquerade (Riviere)9; masculinity becomes a Spectacle/10 We begin with the hypothesis, born out in the practice of the Interscripta colloquium, that although gender presents itself as a given (as something natural, if only because it has been naturalized), masculinity' and 'femininity' are best understood as constructions, as modes of being that depend upon their specific cultural moment to imbue them with meaning.11 To put it another way: most people would agree that no inherent value adheres to dying during battle; the act is simply painful. However, certain societies under necessitating conditions represent such a fate as glorious, perhaps promising its victims the immortality of a Valhalla (Norse mythology) or purgatory-free passage into heaven (crusading propaganda). This sanctification of violent death promulgates an ethos of heroism that, by envaluing communal over personal identities, can either assist its culture in a program of aggressive expansionism or aid the resistance against a neighboring culture's quest for Lebensraum. The battlefield death itself is neutral, a mere event; it accrues its meaning only through its interpretation into culture. So with gender. The code of behavior</page><page sequence="4">the armour of an alienating identity 4 which renders dying in the midst of arms heroic is a part of a gender code: it valorizes a masculinity that through its very selfishness (its practitioners must think themselves worthy of immortality) is altruistic (through the sacrificial deaths of its heroic men the remainder of that society will endure). Heroic masculinity here is wholly dependent upon its generative cultural moment for its codification as a significant means of organizing (and thereby modifying) human behavior; masculinity is changeable, adaptive, reconfigurable? constructed rather than ontological.12 Masculinity is not monolithic, but built from a collection of genders organized (sometimes unsuccessfully) into some sort of cultural coherence. According to the taxonomy inherited from Victorian reception of classical epic, the 'traditional' ('masculine') hero is violent and aggressive; the 'nontraditional' ('feminized') hero is thoughtful and wily, a devisor of strategies rather than a combatant. Achilles, the man of strength, embodies the first type, especially in his savagery toward Hector; Odysseus, the archer and the man of craft, embodies the second. This simple bifurcation (of an already bifurcated) gender has its obvious limits. What are we to make of Achilles' passions for Patroklus and for Troilus, or of Ulysses' rejection of both women and desire as he makes his way home to Ithaca? Achilles' desire is not feminizing?except within the restrictive terms of the Victorian classification scheme, where it creates a heterotaxis that destroys the symmetry upon which the whole system is predicated. The problem is one of cultural imposition and anachronism: masculinity and femininity, like hetero- and homo- sexuality, need to be amplified as cultural categories in order to make classical Greek notions of gender comprehensible (as David Halperin has shown).13 Gendered terms demand constant recontextualization back into the cultural moment that produces them; what was 'non-traditional' for the scholars of a hundred years ago isn't necessarily so for us, or for the ancient Greeks. 'Masculinity (-ies) may be more fruitfully understood as an array than as a difference' (Robert Stein): gender must be taken as a plurality, not as the binarism it deceptively presents. Hence in this discussion we examine medieval masculinities, plural, in order to grant the term its multivocality, its potential for disparate and conflicting voices. Foucault has taught us the impossibility of separating the analysis of the body and its gendered meanings from the matrices of power which allow that significance to be articulated. Masculinity is as much a product of social as of somatic relationships: 'the language of manhood (homo, vir, puer, etc.) is the principal language by which relationships of power are described in early medieval sources_The language of masculinity is the language of martial prowess, property, and governance in a precarious political</page><page sequence="5">the armour of an alienating identity 5 economy (Greg Rose). Thus, in the early Germanic organization of male relationships that Tacitus called the comitatus (and which might better be labeled the M?nnerbund),14 manliness was measured in terms of proper domination and submission along an axis of ascending social power. Tacitus writes that men cluster' around stronger men for protection in an unsteady world of challenge and aggression: 'This retinue has its different ranks, established in accordance with the judgment of its leader. There is great rivalry among the followers as to who shall hold the first place with the chief. There is great rivalry as well among the chiefs as to who will have the largest and most valorous band of followers' {De Origine et Situ Germanorum, xiii-xiv). Masculinity becomes a spectrum of acceptable gender behaviors, with the weak' man finding his place in a life of happy subordination, and the 'powerful/ heroic figure' being responsible for the maintaining of this culture-specific formulation of male to male relationships. To read gender through its embedment in power, then, gender's topography must always be mapped within a cultural arena that includes the social, the political, the anthropological, the economic, and the historical: 'effective masculinity was constantly on trial and...the individual efforts of the would-be hero were continuously accompanied by glances temporally and spatially forward and back, above and below, right and left' (Will Sayers). Anatomy, culture, destiny The personal body is a text across which is written a cultural narrative. Carol Clover has recently argued that a single-sex model for the human body obtained in early northern Europe; gender, she asserts, meant distinguishing between active and passive roles (social and sexual), rather than between who did or did not have a penis.15 The evidence supplied by early northern European law codes even suggests that vagina and anus were imagined as functionally equivalent, at least as far as impregnation fears were involved.16 Gregory of Nyssa in De opificio hominislikewise makes very little of sexual differentiation, perhaps 'because he assumes a one-gender model' of the soul (Ann Matter).17 The mutable signifying power of penises and other 'plumbing' in the Middle Ages raises complex questions about anatomy and destiny: before we can examine of what medieval sexuality might have consisted, we need to understand how bodies were thought to function and to be differentiated. Hippocratic, Aristotelian, Galenic, and Soranic medical thinking about the body were influential to varying degrees: medieval somatic theory is composed of fragmentary epistemes, of 'cluster [s] of gender-related notions' (Laurie Finke) rather than of a monolithic conceptual scheme.18 Humoral theory, concerned</page><page sequence="6">the armour of an alienating identity 6 with explicating how the four bodily fluids determine human behavior through their relative proportions, is at least as important to the Galenic notion of a sexed body as the relationality of penis' to Vagina' (Bruce Holsinger).19 Carol Everest explained that 'Heat is at the root of what it means to be physiologically male_[Males] produce sufficient heat for semen production and the production of plentiful Spiritus to facilitate erection and propulsion of the semen. The manliest of men has abundant innate heat_The effeminate' man, including but not restricted to eunuchs, behaves passively in sexual encounters because the normal outlet for semen has somehow been short circuited. Semen therefore collects in the buttocks, causing desire to be focused in that area.' Contemporary critics tend to reinscribe contemporary signifiers of difference into the Middle Ages; but whereas (post-Freud) sexual dimorphism is predicated upon the presence or absence of a penis (or, more recently, to the presence or absence of a Y chromosome), medieval distinguishing generally involved a more holistic approach to bodily identity, ascribing determinative agency both to pan-corporal phenomena (relative abundance of fluids like phlegm, choler, and the biles; regulation of internal temperature) and to the extra-somatic (alignment of the stars and planets; climate; effects of particular ways of dressing and grooming). Even in medieval texts which seem to declare with Freud that Anatomy is destiny,' competing narratives of gender construction often lurk just below the reductive surface. In Liudprand of Cremona's writing, especially the Antapodosis and De Legatione Constantinopolitana, an obsession with male genitalia and the horror generated by its absence seems at first to argue for a simple biology to sex correspondence in his articulation of gender.10 Eunuchs appear in almost every chapter. Castration is the universal punishment for crimes against authority of any kind; the penis is the phallus here, so that the loss of one is the sign made flesh of the loss of the other. Sometimes these scenes of the missing member are merely humorous, as when Liudprand describes the lascivious Willa's boy-toy priest: 'Those who turned the priest into a eunuch declared there was good reason for the love his mistress bore him: his tool, they discovered, was worthy of Priapus himself (147; in this case the penis has little to do with the man, everything with the errant woman); sometimes they are puzzling, as when Liudprand presents a delighted Constantine with 'four carzimasia, that being the Greek name for eunuchs who have had their testicles and penis removed' (154); sometimes castration is a rhetorical device that allows Liudprand to reduce his enemy to a feminized position (all the Greek bishops become, by a lapsus linguae which delights Liudprand, 'capones' [209]); but most often these vignettes are tense, and</page><page sequence="7">the armour of an alienating identity 7 provoke what might be called gender-anxiety, as when the bishop doesn't know how to describe a Greek eunuch appointed leader of an army: 'As general of this force...[the emperor] has appointed a man of sorts?I say of sorts because the fellow has ceased to be a male and has not been able to become a female.... [He is] a gentleman of neither gender' (190-91, 197). Biology and gender seem here to be coherently aligned: a man without functioning genitalia is not a man. The body is a readable, reductivist text, and tells three possible stories according to what it has, once had, or always lacked. But is it so simple? On closer examination, the relation of sex, gender, and the body in The Embassy to Constantinople is dictated by a narrative that is cultural rather than somatic. Gender for Liudprand has more to do with nationality than anatomy. That which is foreign becomes that which is deficient and (by a familiar leap of logic) that which is feminine. The nasty Byzantines who treated the author so poorly (who in fact feminized him, taunting him with the nickname 'Holy Mother') become a nation of eunuchs: all missing a vital signifier of power and authority that Liudprand, no matter how beleaguered, always confidently possesses. The essence of true manhood resides for Liudprand back home. He is merciless in his transformative rhetoric of representation: from the feminine the Greeks slip into the monstrous, so that the Emperor becomes 'a monstrosity of a man, a dwarf, fat-headed with tiny mole's eyes;...disgraced by a neck scarcely an inch long; piglike by reason of the bristles on his head; in color an Ethiopian' (178). Masculinity and femininity are terms that construct bodies personal and national. Edward Said has written about East-West relations along these culturally gendered lines: in the occidental Imaginary, he argues, the Orient is represented as seductive, enticing, and ready to be conquered by the hypermasculine West.22 In Liudprand's vision the East is a culturally repulsive place, a deficient body made monstrous by the fact that it is fully neither masculine nor feminine, but something in between, something characterized by a lack simultaneously sexual and cultural. Reference to the material body alone simply does not sufficiently explain Liudprand's vision of gendered identity. Just as masculinity cannot be disentangled from specific cultural configurations of the body in its imagined modi operandi, so too specific formulations of masculinity like heroism cannot be isolated from the complex of social relationships that imbue gender with meaning. Liudprand's narrative mixes national, personal, and gender identity into a generative broth that yields a rhetorically effective narrative; what he accomplished in parvo was taking place within a larger pattern of category dependency throughout the Middle Ages. Christian (male) identity, for example, was often defined by</page><page sequence="8">the armour of an alienating identity 8 apposition with and opposition to Muslim monstrosity.' Detailed descriptions of supposed Saracen atrocities abound, often representing the Muslim intrusion into the Holy Land as a violation of the Christian body (forced circumcision, evisceration, dismemberment). Michael Uebel observed that 'the body in pain is objectified [in these accounts], turned into a thing whose boundaries preventing undifferentiated contact with the external world are annihilated by the Saracens....The threat posed to the national/religious body is that of the monster, whose existence is defined by the disruption of boundaries, by the mutation and opening up of the Christian corpus, and by the blurring of the crucial division between inferiority and exteriority. The monstrous other disrupts the Christian universe and produces its limits?such is, perhaps, the paradox of otherness.'13 And so, long after 'the Muslim threat' had effectively passed, Saracens function as the monstrous other that menaces (for example) the knightly integrity of the heroes of Arthurian romance. Relationality: longing and absence Who we are is largely determined by who we are not. Identity is contingent upon a matrix of alterities, represented (and usually devalued) as exterior to a particular mode of being. In constructing maleness, this abjected otherness is or at least overlaps the feminine. Because medieval gender tended to be conceptualized hierarchically, with masculine as the 'default' and/or 'normative' category, the feminine embodied a secondary realm of gendered traits that had to be sloughed off, escaped, exteriorized. This process is especially well illustrated in the romances featuring a 'Fair Unknown as their protagonist. Such tales are promulgated to serve an instructive function; these popular stories revolve around a nameless youth's successful, instructive quest for his place in society. The imbricated questions 'Who is my father?' 'Who am I?' and 'What is my proper social role?' all resolve in the final presentation of the juvenis as knight and hero?that is, as man powerfully aligned with his society's construction of ideal masculinity. Such alignment comes after a quest that illustrates the secondariness of femininity: Perceval leaves his maternal home and transforms through a slow process from bumbling backwoodsman to proper chevalier. Malory provides an even better example in the 'Tale of Sir Gareth': Throughout the course of the tale, Gareth is under construction with respect of gender. Kays designation of Gareth as 'Beaumains' (fair hands) and Lynets term 'kitchen knave are directly tied to a developing sense of gender. It seems to me that there is a conscious attempt to remove 'feminine' aspects of Gareth's gender and to write him more fully in one version of masculinity. The 'Tale of Sir Gareth' allows Malory a particularly significant opportunity to explore the</page><page sequence="9">the armour of an alienating identity 9 development of masculinity through an obviously constituted subjectivity. (Daniel Pigg) Will Sayers expressed this relationship between masculinity and femininity spatially: Women passively carry a sex identity while men are actively engaged in gender. Male sex is the "default".. .in that its possession is not a matter of concern since attention is turned to the more important issue of gender realization. Women are marked, not least by the Church, with the sign of the deviant sex (non-male and variously virginal, reproductive, maternal, socially destabilizing, voracious) and this marking limits the types and degree of gender realization that are possible. Gender is then contained by the female sex and the force is centripetal. For the man, male sex, like superior physical strength, is the given, the point of departure is the elaboration of gender; movement is centrifugal. Yet the feminized body?regardless of anatomical sex?could also be the object of worship; in the case of the male body, this sacred value exists not despite its dual gendering but because of it. Caroline Walker Bynum's Jesus as Mother examines the veneration of a Christ who lactates rather than bleeds;24 the narrator of the prose devotional A Talkyng of the Loue of God (14th century) 'imagines himself as the male lover of a female Christ/ and as an infant being nursed (M. McCrillis).25 These feminized visions of Jesus' body coexisted with heroic representations, such as Langland's knightly Christ and the warrior king of the 'Dream of the Rood' (Norman Hinton). Further, tender emotions that at first do not seem consonant with the hypermasculinity of heroism are perfectly acceptable in their expression at certain culturally sanctioned times, notably at moments of loss. That the hero grieves when his companion or his love has been taken from him signals the relational status of masculinity: because gender derives simultaneously from what one is ('being') and what one must not be (the abjected Other), meaning in gender is predicated upon contexts of activity and association. Identity, in other words, is partly or wholly contingent on community: social ties imbue the personal with its significance, not vice versa. As Laurie Finke puts it, 'we can only construct male and female, masculine and feminine relationally. Neither has any meaning in and of itself, but only in relation to the other. Thus medieval masculinities can only be defined as they set themselves apart from medieval femininities.' Will Sayers illustrates this dual relationality by reference to Celtic myth: 'The male hero is defined by what he is and what he does, but in no less degree by what he is not. Yet the dividing line between male and female as realized in action cannot be unilaterally drawn by the hero himself In a variety of ways, the male protagonist is held up to the scrutiny of the supernatural female and judgment is passed</page><page sequence="10">the armour of an alienating identity 10 on his adequacy as hero?Male identity and worth are not only won from but confirmed by the female whose essential Otherness is here allied with the supernatural, the monstrous, the marginal, and the chaotic, as if only the females elevation to a higher, or transfer to a different, category of being made possible the dialogue between non-peers.' Elizabeth Rowe applies this same rule to Malory, who sets Lancelot's and Gawain's masculinities against Elaine's and Guenevere's femininities'; further, 'Lancelot's spiritual instability? the one imperfection that prevents him from achieving the Grail?is connected not only with his political instability toward Arthur, but also with Malory's own political instability as a follower of Warwick, who switched his loyalties several times during the War of the Roses.' Again, outside of the social and the relational, gender is meaningless. This dependency of one category upon its other translates, in romance and in elegy, to a vision of masculinity in which the hero is hurled into a melancholic state of lack when his beloved is absent. Sir Orfeo loses his regnal identity when his queen is kidnapped by an adultery-minded elf; the king is restored from his wildman state only when he rescues his wife and can return to a wholeness of being found (in this poem) only in the sanctified union of marriage.26 The Black Knight of Chaucer's Book of the Duchess is haunted by the terrifying realization of the partiality of his identity when faced with the loss of Lady White.2" In the absence of their loves, both Orfeo and the Black Knight exhibit traits that in the chivalric worlds through which they move are gendered feminine, suggesting that when the complementary pair is broken through the death or absence of the beloved, the suddenly isolated masculine body temporarily moves toward a duality of gender that is to be received as affecting rather than troubling. This evocative loss need not involve a vanished female lover, however. Bardic poets mourned the passing of their patrons 'by characterizing themselves as widows'; we might wonder, then, whether the elegist and keener was not gendered female, the pathetic theme and treatment dictating that the appropriate advantage point for comment be a feminine one' (Will Sayers). James Goldstein suggests similar reduction to metaphorical widowhood occurs in the Alliterative Morte Arthur^ when Arthur mourns the loss of his men on the battlefield: This is, I believe, the first time we see Arthur weep in the poem. No wonder Arthur in his final moments sees himself in the position of a widow when he looks upon the bodies of the knights who: Mayntenyde my manhede be myghte of theire handes... I may helples one hethe house be myn one, Alls a waful wedowe that wanttes hir beryn;</page><page sequence="11">the armour of an alienating identity il I may werye and wepe and wrynge myn handys, For my wytt and my wirchipe awaye es for euer! (4284-88) [I may live alone on a heath, like a grieving widow who misses her husband; I may curse and weep and wring my hands, for my reason and my renown are gone forever!] Heroes often have close friends for whom they feel a passionate, sometimes even an eroticized or sadomasochistic attachment: this pairing is the 'heroes and their buddies' topos.Zi) At times the friend seems to exist only to die or disappear, precipitating a fall into the kind of madness or mourning an absent female beloved might trigger (Achilles and Patroklus, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Arthur and Gawain, Amis and Amiloun, Lancelot and Galehaur?0). At other times the companion is a faithful sidekick or second-in-command who makes fuller the heroic possibilities of the man whom he lovingly follows (Aeneas and fidus Achates, Brutus and Corineus, Kjartan and Bolli, Erec and Guivret, Yvain and his anthropomorphic lion). A third possibility is for the friend to embody what is traditionally thought of as the feminine (Freud called it the pre-oedipal), ordinarily as part of a Laurel and Hardy or Odd Couple kind of pairing. In romance, a hero might adopt a giant as his page or squire (Bevis of Hampton and Ascopart, Guillaume d'Orange and Rainouart). The out-of control body of the giant contrasts with the normative masculinity embodied in the hero. The giant is indoctrinated into chivalry as a way of promulgating an orthodox code of gender behavior; his mistakes are to be laughed at, exorcised. The rebuke to improper masculinity as represented by the male grotesque in comedy is not far removed from the rebuke conveyed by the defeat of the monster in more somber narratives like Beowulf; the line between friend and enemy, like the line between masculinity and femininity, is a fine one indeed, and is (not surprisingly) also demarcated through the incorporation of gender. We can go further: in extreme cases the line between species, supposed to be foundational, may become 'fluid and negotiable'?as in La Dame escoillee or Yvain (James Goldstein). These blurrings are well illustrated in the Alliterative Morte Arthure. Arthur's most heroic battle is waged against the giant of Mont Saint Michel, a 'masculine body out of control' (James Goldstein) who keeps a 'kyrtill' fashioned from the beards of subjugated kings. Arthur punishes the giant with a double dismemberment: castration (the giant is a rapist who splits maidens open with his lust); and decapitation (the promised end of all giants, and a powerful moment of identity-formation for the hero). So far, nothing unusual: giants always die this way.?i The hero's defeat of the monster demonstrates that his own construction of masculinity is properly aligned with the norms that drive the narrative; the beheading of the giant is the exorcism of all that is inimical</page><page sequence="12">the armour of an alienating identity 12 to the heroic code, to the rules of (sexual and political) control that pass for full manhood. Yet the giant of Mont Saint Michel is no ordinary Romance giant.32 True, he receives the traditional narrative condemnation by encoding almost every negative attribute a monster is capable of embodying, especially in his boundless appetite and racial alterity; but this reflexive rejection is subtly eroded by conflating him with Arthur, and by the text s taking a perverse delight in the celebration of his atrocious excess. The Alliterative Morte suggests that the defeat of the giant is not always a banishing, not always a transference of power with a simultaneous reversal of its moral valence; in Arthurs case, monstrousness and heroism are states not wholly predicated upon difference. Even the giant s sexual lack of control, genetic to the monster of Romance, is here for the first time part of a political wildness?an aggressive violation of boundary that does not stop at the physical body. The giant is, like Arthur, a king. He controls fifteen realms, demanding as yearly tribute the beards of his vassal regents (an act Arthur will reproduce with the envoys of Lucius later in the poem). The presence of the 'kyrtill' fashioned from this trimmed away hair erodes the morality of Arthur s vision of forcibly uniting disparate realms into a British empire; the giants monarchal achievement reifies the goal of Arthurs own ambition. Further, the giant wants nothing more than to add Arthur's beard to this garment of forced subjugation: his role as twin, as speculum of what Arthur might be (or become), is made evident by the cord of desire which binds him to the British king. The gruesome feast of male children has a parallel in Arthurs elaborate feast of ungrazed' meat back home. Repeated phrases link the two verbally. At the end of their long battle, the king and the giant are physically entwined, to the point at which they can be separated only by death; Kay thinks it is Arthur who has been overcome. The giant will continue to have an ambiguous life within Arthur, and toward the end of the narrative it becomes difficult to tell the two apart. Late in the campaign, for example, after the battles have degenerated to self aggrandizement and corrupt excuses for looting, an extended visualization of the devastation of war appears, undermining the endeavor which the British king has declared to be his culminating achievement: Walles he weite down, wondyd knyghtez, Towres he turnes and turmentez the pople; Wroghte wedewes full wlonke, wrotherayle synges, Ofre wery and wepe and wryngen theire handis, And all he wastys with werre thare he awaye rydez ? Thaire welthes and theire wonnynges wandrethe he wroghte!</page><page sequence="13">the armour of an alienating identity 13 ['He tore down walls, wounded knights, razed towers and tormented the people; he made nobles widows, who lament their fate, often curse and weep and wring their hands, and he wastes all with war, wherever he rides ? their belongings and habitations he completely destroys!] Read 'the giant instead of 'Arthur' for the text s 'he and the description seems no less appropriate, so completely does the king become his own foe. Such, perhaps, is the fate of heroic masculinity. Heroism and masculinity We have spoken of heroism as if its relationship to masculinity were transparent, but in reality heroism is complexly situated within that gendered arena. Generally, the hero represents a kind of hypermasculinity, an exaggerated and perhaps idealized version of maleness that is promulgated with a social intention: ordinary men are to measure themselves against the impossible standard that the hero embodies, and from this conditioned inadequacy strive to fight harder and control themselves better. A heroism that does not incorporate a call for its own reiteration through time necessarily vanishes. The heroic code demands that its adherents live up to its ideals, or perish striving. Chivalry establishes a rule based method of living that, when adhered to, regulates the personal body in a way beneficial to the smoother functioning of the social body; this fiction is disseminated through the geste of the hero, who has been created only in order to be desired. The hero, like the saint, is an exemplum who exists to be imitated, though never equaled. The problem, of course, is that knights with 'troubled' sexualities are always more interesting than their orthodox counterparts. In Malory's Morte Darthur, Sir Gareth marries his true love Lyonesse and disappears from view, while Lancelot continues his problematic relationship with Guenevere and remains central to the narrative until its end (Beverly Kennedy). A counter-current in heroism acknowledges the inherent danger of potently distilling aggressive impulse into a single figure who can potentially turn against what he is supposed to protect. As Daniel Melia puts it, 'One of the great problems of societies with warrior castes.. .is what to do with these hypermasculine types when they are not doing their thing on the battlefield.' From this anxiety an impulse arises to move the hero outside the circle of culture once his function has been executed?once the enemy has been defeated, or the time of war has come to an end. Perhaps the problem is solved by having the hero live a short but spectacular life, so that 'heroic masculinity has its longest and truest life in distilled form, in posthumous glory'; the many 'dead ends of heroism' (short life, absence of descendants, absence of ruling power or wealth) might indicate</page><page sequence="14">the armour of an alienating identity 14 that martial heroes are not more masculine than other men, only differently and more narrowly so' (William Sayers). The same delimiting impulse that promulgates codes of honor may invent, in times of peace, smaller spheres of action inside which masculinity might be contained: this domesticizing gesture seems to have been at work in the construction and valorization of the husband as a social institution among the upper classes late in the Middle Ages (Clare Lees, Beverly Kennedy).33 Thus Chr?tiens Yvain, like Erec before him, ends his brief but spectacular career of aventure happily married and residing in a castle in the suburbs.34 This check on heroism's widening gyre is itself potentially dangerous to martial masculinity: sometimes 'men are represented as "paying the price" for social order by having their internal behavior fatally constrained.' Cuchulainn, under ageis not to eat dogmeat, pretends to swallow some to please his nurse; his hand and thigh are weakened from touching the food, and in the next battle he dies, a victim of public obligations and private necessities' that he cannot reconcile (Daniel Melia). Heroism is always a difficult kind of masculinity: times change, and what cultures demand of their heroes change with the times. Sometimes the hero can adapt: hence we have Einhards Charlemagne, the Charlemagne of the chansons de geste, and the Charlemagne of late Romance. Arthur provides an even better example: as the identity he embodies metamorphosizes, he becomes the patron hero of the British, the Welsh, the Anglo-Normans, the English, the British empire, and American anglophiles successively. New heroes are invented as their elder counterparts age, taking time-bound masculinities with them to the grave; as Alcuin demanded of the monks of Lindisfarne, once the church bells have tolled the passing of Germanic warrior modes of living, then what hath Ingeld to do with Christ?35 Sanctity and Heroism In examining the masculinities that cluster beneath the rubric of heroism, we have been unwrapping a kind of manhood with wide imbrications. Like all gendered terms, heroism is always slipping into other significations, other arenas of culture. 'Saint' and 'hero' can become indistinguishable in certain discourses: militant hagiography, like the Old English 'Judith,' where the female saint's decapitation of Holofernes has an analogue in Beowulf's triumphant display of Grendel's severed head; the plays of Hrotswitha of Gandersheim, in which women's bodies become a gendered battlefield where masculinity always loses to feminine heroic sanctity (Bruce Venarde).36 Likewise 'hero' and 'monster' tend to conflate (Grettifs saga embraces this possibility, while the Alliterative Morte Arthure suggests that the two categories are not wholly</page><page sequence="15">the armour of an alienating identity 15 predicated upon difference). The Middle English romance Sir Gowther conjoins all three of these supposedly discrete categories.37 The narrative details how the son of an incubus progresses from a mis-spent youth of burning nuns and murdering priests (typical adolescent pranks) to a heroic adulthood of protecting the royal court from Saracens. By labeling Sir Gowther a vita sancti 'm its explicit, the anonymous author places chivalry next to godliness. Gowther s quest for personal identity is written as a quest for heroic fulfillment: finding his place means learning to subordinate himself properly to authority (ecclesiastical and political), as well as to keep his body carefully regulated (especially as regards violence and sexuality). Sir Gowther disseminates and sanctifies an ideal of masculinity in which control is all. Ideal manhood becomes secular sainthood. Malory, too, vexes the relationship between saintliness and heroism. Lancelots miraculous healing of Sir Urry is a successful chivalric imitation of Galahad's healing of the Fisher King; at his death, the problematic nature of his sanctity is revealed: by the changes Malory made to the accounts of Lancelots death in his sources. In the French Morte Artu and the Stanzaic Le Morte Arthur, Lancelot dies of an illness caused by his life of penance, the result of his devotion to religious duty. According to Malory, Lancelot dies because in his sorrow he refuses food and drink, and lies grovelyng on the tomb of Arthur and Guenevere. As with Gawain, whose body is brought to honored public rest at Dover castle, a final sign of the social nature of Lancelot s 'redemption is his burial at his own fortress, rather than at his hermitage. (Elizabeth Rowe) Lancelot dies in an odor of sanctity, but it is a pungency that carries with it the scent of battlefields, chivalry, and feats performed for love. Sanctity may be difficult to separate from heroism, but the threats hagiography opposes to its protagonists elicit suffering and passive resistance as easily as active, violent vanquishment. Heroic narrative explodes with the latter: no action, no heroes. Orthodox heterosexual relationships (as embodied, for example, in the institution of marriage) and heroism therefore do not seem to mix; to settle down?to stop moving?is to die (or at least for the narrative, to end). Heroic masculinity is performative: a gendered identity that derives from feats of arms (or Teats of arms and love'), it is always to be proven in movement (wandering, errantry) through the world. Sanctity, which could be defined as ecclesiastically sanctioned masculinity, stresses the essential nature of identity: the eremitic saint discovers his true self by rejecting both community and sexuality. He turns inward to find a soul defined by its relation to God alone. Saint Antonys battles against devils in the psychological</page><page sequence="16">the armour of an alienating identity 16 topography of the desert reveal the very different formulation of masculinity that he embodies. According to Athanasius in his VitaAntonii, one can wander into the wastelands and through interior struggle discover in the fullest sense who one truly is: through God and meditation to the soul, to the core of ones being.38 When a hero surrenders to this same antisocial landscape (usually in the form of a trackless forest), he becomes a wildman, an animal in human form. Yvain, Lancelot, Orfeo, Amadis, and Orlando all discover in their feral states that without a social context to imbue personal identity with a signification and without a communally sanctioned arena of performance, 'things fall apart; the center cannot hold,' masculinity loses its self-awareness and devolves into mere and senseless being. Anthonys desert habitat is a geography of complete male self-sufficiency, as his less than cordial reception makes clear to the admirers who visit his isolated cave. The presence of a feminine body is a menace to the somatic and spiritual integrity of the ascetic male saint: the Legenda Aurea (ch.113) 'records the story of a hermit tempted by the Devil disguised as a naked woman; he exorcises her by dropping a priests stole over her head, whereupon she suffers instant putrefaction (Brian S. Lee). The masculine body is imaged here as self-contained in its celibate holiness?perfectly whole, sanctified because noncontiguous with feminine corporality, identity, and desire. Such visions of fantastic male autonomy are germane not only to hagiography, but appear also in Romance and medieval historiography. The French prose Queste del Saint Graal describes how Sir Bors refuses to sleep with a transcorporal devil (described as 'so lovely and so fair that it seemed all earthly beauty was embodied in her'), and his steadfast assertion of autonomy banishes her shrieking back to hell.39 Brutus, the Trojan (an adjective now inseparable from images of virility and?opposite to its medieval connotations?non-reproduction) founding father of Britain, inseminates a virginal, supremely fecund land with his men, and gives birth to a nation; surely women were brought along with the refugees, but Geoffrey of Monmouth elides them from his narrative {History of the Kings of Britain) .4? In later chronicle tradition, the Greek princess Albina attempts the same foundational gesture and is impregnated by an incubus with incestuous giants, a monstrous but reifying punishment for feminine presumption of heroic gender sufficiency (Des Grantz G?ants).*1 All borders are potentially permeable (cf. Laxdoela saga or Melusine, where gender has no correlation to foundational power), but in this particular fable that masquerades as history, only masculine bodies are eligible for autogeny; if the phallus is detachable, then so is the womb.</page><page sequence="17">the armour of an alienating identity 17 Signifying manhood The signifiers of masculinity are not limited to (or by) the anatomy of particular bodies, but extend into almost every realm of human experience, from where one is born to how one dresses, carries oneself, speaks. For example, the horse (ambler, palfrey, nag, stallion) semiotically marks its rider; in the case of a knight errant, the lack of a steed is identity-robbing {pas de cheval, pas de chevalier). The presence or absence of a beard is a visual signal that the text of the body should be read against a particular set of gendered norms. Hairiness and manliness are intertwined in the Middle Ages, perhaps because an abundance of hair is a sign of male sexual potency': Abundant innate heat and natural moisture cause hair growth; the same heat and moisture are necessary for ample semen production which in turn is linked to the hardness and duration of the erection' (Carol Everest). The absence of the Pardoner's beard (among other things?) has been a notorious crux in Chaucer scholarship, and seems to contrast with the Summoner's piled' facial hair (B. S. Lee). When in Sir Gawain and the Green KnightOtherworldly challenger bursts into Arthur's court on Christmas, he announces contemptuously that 'Hit arn aboute on this bench bot berdlez chylder'O There are none but beardless children around this table,' I.280); he aggressively opposes his own maleness to a courtly refinement he dismisses as prepubescent.42 The more hair one has, according to the classification scale the Green Knight constructs, the closer one is to nature, the more feral, the more testosterone-heavy in one's masculinity. Einhard in his Life of Charlemagne mentions Charles' public tonsuring of his rebellious countrymen, a political disempowering coded through a haircut. The giant of Mount Saint Michael weaves a garment from the beards of kings he subjugates in the Alliterative Morte Arthurer, later in the same work Arthur shaves Lucius' envoy as an act of public humiliation. The romance Sir Ferumbras likewise contains scenes in which the rending of an opponent's beard is equated with the clipping away of his masculinity;43 the Siege of Jerusalem contains a scene in which 'the Jews send Waspasian's envoys back shorn, blackened, naked as needles, and with a cheese tied around their necks' (B.S. Lee).44 Sometimes this shaving ritual functions as a displaced or symbolic castration; always, when ceremonialized, the aggressive act becomes public theatre which establishes a relationship of dominance (the shaver) and submission (the shaved). The Wildman, on the other hand, is both hirsute and removed from hierarchical social orders?and therefore either threatening or alluring in his rugged individualism. Hair, like clothing, is a slippery marker of such imbricated categories as sex, class, geographical origin, and social position (Steve Davis); when Giraldus</page><page sequence="18">the armour of an alienating identity 18 Cambrensis describes the Irish as 'truly barbarous, being not only barbarous in their dress, but suffering their hair and beards (barbis) to grow enormously in an uncouth manner,' he collapses Toreigner' with sexually other': Moreover, these people, who have customs so very different from others, and so opposite to them, on making signs either with the hands or the head, beckon when they mean you should go away, and nod backwards as often as they wish to be rid of you. Likewise, in this nation, the men pass their water sitting, the women standing....The women, also, as well as the men, ride astride, with their legs on each side of the horse.45 Material signifiers, further, are constituative: it is impossible to say if a man makes his clothing, or clothes have made the man. Wendy Pfeffer explained that in the Roman de Silence, the female protagonist is described at birth with feminine pronouns and adjectives (ele iert rich, I.2060); for reasons of inheritance she is raised as a boy, and when she departs from home 'to become a knight a gender shift occurs in the narration (ilmeismes se doctrine, I.2385) and in direct discourse; Silence's father addresses his offspring as biais fils (I.2445).'46 Cucullus facitmonachum. Paul Schaffer provided the example of Ide, the granddaughter of Huon of Bordeaux: fleeing her incest-minded father, Ide wears armor and performs deeds of prowess that earn her knighthood. Olive, daughter of the emperor of Rome, falls in love with her/ him (the narrative itself uses a confusing mix of pronouns), they marry, Ide is about to be exposed as a sexual fraud, the Virgin Mary intercedes, and the hero(ine) is transformed into 'a perfect man as all others be with out any difference.'47 Within a year, Ide gives birth to a son, the deliciously named Croissant. The bodily metamorphosis only reifies a deeper change both signaled in and precipitated by Ide s cross-dressing. In Laxdaela saga, Gudrun, angered by her first husband's slapping her, weaves him a shirt with a wide neck opening and, when he wears it, divorces him on the grounds that he dresses in effeminate (d?collet?) clothing.48 She then urges Thord to divorce his wife Aud on the grounds that she wears men's breeches; he does so and marries Gudrun. Later Aud comes riding to Thord's house ('she was certainly wearing breeches then'), enters the bedroom, and gashes him with a short sword 'across both nipples' (the part of the anatomy that men's clothing was not supposed to exhibit). Remarkably, Thord insists that Aud not be punished, 'saying that she had only done what she had to.' The anxiety over clothing as a marker of identity here indicates that it is an inaccurate or transmutable signifier?like the body itself. Thord believes that he deserves what he gets because he realizes that by pushing Aud into the masculine/strong category, he's entered the weak/passive/feminized role; the</page><page sequence="19">the armour of an alienating identity 19 episode appears to be, as Carol Clover suggests, an example of 'no [predetermined] sex, no [essentialized] gender.' The point of such transformational narratives is less that sexual identity is unstable (even though it is), but that '"male" or "masculine" are matters of convenience or convention only, at least in comparison to the more important categories "true," "virtuous," "devout," "noble," and "gentle"'(Paul Schaffner). Silence, Ide, Thord and Aud remain continuous in their identities within these cultural categories, even if their sexed and gendered bodies shift. Heroic endings As a political mythology, heroism is surprisingly quite poor' (Peter van Heusden): it offers a mode of behavior, but by making its best representative more than human (hypermasculine, sanctified, even perhaps divine), it disallows that mode's successful repetition. The necessary end for heroism is death, even if that death is construed as a valorization through glory of the preceding life; and so heroism as a gender code has built within its deep structure the inevitability of its own passing, and to a degree, its own failure. Heroism incorporates a nostalgia for a time that never was but ought to be again; famous last words memorialize the hero through an act performed by his chronicler, not by the hero himself (Steve Partridge). Sometimes the hero seems to realize the oblivion of his promised end, and arranges for the memorial by which he hopes to endure: Beowulf convinces himself that his name will be immortalized in local topography {Biowulfes biorh); Brutus knows that his eponymous power founds a nation and a gender ideal; the 'heroes of self memorialization in Norse tradition compose metrically complex verse and clever phrases at death (Will Sayers, Daniel Melia). Ultimately, however, if heroism endures, it survives because of its complex arousal of approval, admiration, wonder, and longing. That it is impossible renders it more, not less, desirable. The death of the hero also assures that, as a gender code, heroic masculinity will continue to be reinvented, replenished, reconstructed. Heroism divides into heroisms; masculinity splinters into masculinities; cultural categories built upon notions of 'otherness' refuse to remain distinct, multiplying and imbricating. Medieval masculinities: circling through versions of heroism, visions of sanctity, ways of living within and fleeing from this world, we return to the plurality of gender with which we began. Although the path we have followed traced the steep ascent of larger-than-life versions of masculinity, if only because such giantism incorporates a ready visibility and a constant reminder of its own distinctness from the natural,' we end as we began: with</page><page sequence="20">the armour of an alienating identity 20 gender spread before us in a marvelous, multifold array. If we have learned anything along the way, it is simply this: although understanding medieval masculinities may be the goal of our inquiry, it will never be its full achievement. The investigation that stops moving, that settles down with comfortable answers in that castle in the suburbs will end its narrative and vanish; gender study, like its very object, must always be in performance in order to be alive. george Washington university Jeffrey Jerome Cohen (jjc0hen@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu) is Assistant Professor of English and Human Sciences at George Washington University.

For a medievalist's view, however, a good starting point might be the essays in the April 1993 'Studying Medieval Women' issue of Speculum (vol. 68, no. 2). Nancy F. Partners 'No Sex, No Gender' (pp. 419?43) provides a synopsis of both schools, and sides with essentialism; Kathleen Biddick's 'Genders, Borders, Bodies: Technologies of the Visible' (pp. 389-418) is an excellent practice of constructivist theory. See also Glenn Burger's provocative comments on the impossible binarism these divisions of thought construct, and the possibilities of circumnavigation offered by queer theory: 'Queer Chaucer,' English Studies in Canada 20.2 (June 1994). 12 Even if heroism (like gender itself) is constructed, this inherent artificiality does not imply that one kind of masculinity can simply be shrugged off to adopt another. One cannot change gendered identities with the same ease with which one might (for example) change Halloween costumes: the cultural forces invested in maintaining order within given societies ensure that there will always be a dangerous friction involved in such transformations. Useful here is Judith Butler's reply to the critics who took her notion of gender performativity too far, arguing that one can adopt a newly gendered self through sheer force of will: 'If I were to argue that genders are performative, that could mean that I thought that one woke in the morning, perused the closet or some more open space for the gender of choice, donned the gender for the day, and then restored the garment to its place at night. Such a willful and instrumental subject, one who decides on its gender, is clearly not its gender from the start and fails to realize that its existence is already decided by gender (Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex" [New York: Routledge, 1993], p.x). Construction is a 'constitutive constraint': it inhibits more than it liberates. Agency exists in gender construction, but in a vexed and friction filled relationship. Bodies That Matter, especially in the introduction and chapter eight, is the best and most influential recent contemplation of the problems of constructivism. 13 One Hundred Years of Homosexuality (New York and London: Routledge, 1990). 14.

Mary Hamel (New York: Garland, 1984). 29 To return to the Alliterative Morte, for example, 'When Arthur finds the body of Gawain late in the poem, he embraces and kisses the dead buddy, delivers his lament, resumes kissing in a passage that nearly totters between the erotic and the sado-masochistic' (James Goldstein). E. Ann Matter expands on this theme: 'It is striking how many of these friends seem made to be sacrificed and consequently lamented. It's also noteworthy how often the feminine characteristics associated with 'good' heroes (sensitivity, ability to weep, loyalty) are seen especially clearly in these interactions with the friends of their heart. What these heroes show is all of human emotional potential rolled up together in the strong and honored male. It's true for the heroes and equally true for the twelfth century monks. Think of William of St. Thierry or Rupert of Deutz agonizing over their homoerotic connections to big and true heroes like Bernard of Clairvaux or, well, Christ.' 30 Of the last pair Samuel Rosenburg writes: 'It is customary to see in the Lanceloten prose a love triangle with Lancelot, Arthur, and Guenevere at the three corners. That triangle, though, to be fair, needs to be seen as interlocking with another, formed by Galehaut, Guenevere, and Lancelot. Or, to put it another way, just as Lancelot and Arthur have competing claims on the Queen, the Queen and Galehaut are in competition for the love of Lancelot.' 31 See Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, 'Decapitation and Coming of Age: Constructing Masculinity and the Monstrous,' The Arthurian Yearbook, vol.
