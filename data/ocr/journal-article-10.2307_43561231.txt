<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Brincard, M. Th. (ed.), Sounding Forms. Afri- can Musical Instruments. New York: Ameri- can Foundation of Arts, 1989. 207p., photo- graphs, figures, notes, bibliography. A catalogue prepared for an exhibition of mu- sical instruments is usually limited to a presenta- tion of the objects on display, preceded by an in- troductory chapter outlining a general historical and anthropological background of the instru- ments concerned. The catalogue under review is an exception to this rule, in that the introductory chapter is replaced by ten individual contribu- tions of researchers who have distinguished themselves in the field of African music and mu- sical instruments. This series of articles starts with "Sounding Forms" in which the editor Brincard, M. Th. ex- plains the conception and the aim of the exhibi- tion, namely select works that are clearly as much art as instruments of music. The idea to exhibit musical instruments as sculptural art ob- jects should complete a lacuna due to the fact that instrument's sculptural qualities falls be- tween such disciplines as anthropology, ethno- musicology and art history, the sculptural ele- ment per se does not seem to be essential to the instrument's function. To complete the study of musical instruments the author wishes with the aid of an art-historical examination permit to understand, evaluate, and appre- ciate the convergence in these objects of sound and form (p. 1 6). Therefore the authors, each following his meth- odological lights, draw attention to sculptural aspects of African musical instruments. The ico- nographie themes; anthropomorphism and zoo- morphism and the symbolism from which they derive are leading subjects in all contributions. 98 Nevertheless it seems that all authors are willing to describe decoration and symbolic meaning of these anthropomorphic and zoomorphic fig- ures, but they always have to refer and to place these instruments in a larger anthropological and/or ethnomusicological (sounds) context. This proves that a musical instrument can not be analyzed only from a sculptural artistic point of view, it remains always on the first place an ob- ject which produces sounds and music. Furthermore, not all musical instruments in Af- rica have an artistic sculptural dimension. Ob- viously, the intention of those who put the ex- hibition together was to select only instruments of a typical beauty and expressiveness. We are by no means offered an overview of all types of musical instruments that exist in sub-Saharan Africa. The choice is limited chiefly to west and central Africa, supplemented with a few ex- amples from Tanzania. For this exhibition, the organizers received the cooperation of some 63 institutions and/or private collectors who lent objects, including the most important museum collections of Europe. The contributions of authors can actually be subdivided into three categories: (1) general considerations about various aspects of the instruments (Nketia, Söder- berg, Thompson, Laurenty); (2) discussion of certain types of instruments (DeVale, Geary, Schmidt); (3) presentation of three instruments on exhibit (Ross, Roy). The restricted latitude within which the con- tributing authors were forced to work, inevitably led to overlaps and repetitions. Kwabena Nketia, states in his article "The Aesthetic Dimensions of African Musical Instru- ments" that musical instruments played for recreation, aesthetic enjoyment and making part of cel- ebrations of the life cycle (ceremonies, rit- uals, festivals) ... are valued for the impact of their sounds, for their aesthetic interest,</page><page sequence="2">and as objects having personal and group sentiments, tradition and history. He describes the phenomenon "musical in- strument" in general terms and more specifically some drum-types and -ensembles from Nigeria as cultural objects as well as objects of aesthetic interest. He also analyzes the conceptualization of sounds and sound sources and the modes of presentation and aesthetic focus. The article signed by Söderberg, "African Mu- sical Instruments and their Decoration," is in fact a revised translation by J. Shepley of the au- thor's article "Les instruments de musique afri- cains et leur décorations" (Söderberg 1977). He treats in general the decoration of musical in- struments and musical instruments serving as decorative motifs on other objects. R. Farris Thompson's contribution "Body and Voice: Kongo Figurative Musical Instruments" accentuates the role of the human body as an ul- timate source of musical articulation by the Kongo people (Zaire, Angola, Congo Republic). Images of the human body symbolize the life of the spirit in patterned sound. They are consider- ed as human beings, invoking the people from wherever they may sound. They stamp the in- strument with social meaning. As examples for this theory he described a nsi whistle, a mpungi ivory transverse trumpet, a madibu wooden bell, a nkongo a lemba wooden slit drum and a ngoma drum. J. S. Laurenty, a well-known organologist for his morphologic studies of the immense collec- tion of musical instruments from Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi, preserved in the Royal Museum of Central Africa (Tervuren-Belgium) contributes to this catalogue with "Anthropomorphism, Zoo- morphism and Abstraction in the Musical Instru- ments of Central Africa," a morphologic and sys- tematic analysis of several chordophones (harp) and aerophones (whistle, horn) from Zaire with special attention to the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic decoration. A more specific article dedicated to one type of musical instruments has been written by S. C. deVale on "African Harps: Construction, Deco- ration and Sound." The author states that this type of instrument is played by people in more than fifty cultures, each with a distinct musical tradition. The variations in the construction, de- coration and sculpture of African harps serve as excellent examples of the ingeniousness of Afri- can instrument-makers. From this statement she describes the morphology of harps with longitudinal as well as vertical string holders or bridges, projected on their historical back- ground and social and ritual meaning (for example the ngombi harp of the Fang and Ngbaka). In the same style as DeVale's article, the one of Chr. M. Geary, "Slit Gongs in the Cameroon Grassfields: Sights and Sounds of Beauty and Power", is dedicated to a number of slit drums of the Bamum Kingdom in Cameroon, formerly serving traditional purposes (social and signal- communication), now changed to a showpiece, alluding to the glorious Bamum past when the kingdom was one of the major forces in the area. These monumental slit drums with attached human figures, property of Bamum kings and queens, and ritually consecrated, prove a large spectrum of forms and uses in the Cameroon Grasslands. The author also mentions zoomor- phic slit drums as well as the existence of smaller portable slit drums in the musical culture of Cameroon. The lamellophones in sub-Saharan Africa have a widespread repartition. C. E. Schmidt has choosen in her article "African mbira as Musical Icons," the term mbira to indicate the lamello- phone. The use of this term, as well as sanza or likembe, has provoked controversies in organo- logica! studies. Some ethnomusicologists as Kubik and Tracey prefer the more generic term "lamellophone," pointing out that the instrument has many different regional names, and one specific name can not be used as a generic term. Nketia on the other hand states that the name mbira nowadays is widely used in a more gener- ic way, by Africans in different parts of the conti- nent, even where the name mbira as such is un- known as a proper type of lamellophone. The 99</page><page sequence="3">editor of this catalogue adopted in all articles in- deed the term mbira to indicate the African la- mellophone. We can not endorse this decision. Starting from the idea that each of these mbira has its own distinctive and iconic system based on cultural ideology as well as the individual maker's own creativity, the author analyzes con- struction and performance-practice of the mbira on the background of visual and musical aes- thetic concepts. Two authors, D. H. Ross "Master Drums from Akan Popular Bands" and Chr. D. Roy "A nuna- Flute: Attribution and Meaning," limit their con- tribution to the description of one or more spe- cific instruments. Ross describes two master drums (cat. no. 48 and 50 of the exhibition) deco- rated with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures. They represent the musical and visual focal point of instrumental, choral and dance groups organized primarily for the purposes of entertainment in southern Ghana. Roy concludes the series of articles by a brief morphologic description of a nuna flute from southern Burkina Faso, a combination of a bird head with its long, curving beak, a human head and a mouthpiece that resembles the tail of a fish. The major part of this publication, however, is reserved for the catalogue. Each of the 1 80 in- struments on display is depicted in the cata- logue, mostly in black and white (as a result, some of the photos are of lesser quality), where- as the colour photographs are of superior qual- ity. Furthermore, there is a short explanatory text for each instrument with particular emphasis on the morphology. The instruments themselves are subdivided into categories (strings, membranophones, idio- phonic and wind instruments). In this regard, it is still remarkable that general terms like mbira for the lamellophone and slit-gong instead of slit- drum are still used. Cooperation with organologists for such pur- poses should consequently not be limited to 100 writing an article: instead, the organologist should be involved in the organizing and editorial team, so as to avoid incorrect and confusing ter- minology.
