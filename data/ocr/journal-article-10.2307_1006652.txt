Without the generous support of these organizations and committees I would not have had the time or the means to carry out my researches on the sculpture of Filippo della Valle. Hugh Honour, who wrote a short but extremely informative article on della Valle in 1959, has provided me with valuable information and made available to me his notes and several of his photographs. He and John Fleming have been good friends and colleagues. Jennifer Montagu knows as much about eighteenth-century Roman sculpture as anyone. She has steered me in the right direction any number of times (and warned me against some tempting but misleading assumptions!). Robert Enggass, to whom this book is dedicated, introduced me to Filippo della Valle many years ago; he also gave me the bulk of the photographs that I have used in this book. His visual documentation of eighteenth-century Roman sculpture, which he prepared with assistance from the Samuel Kress Foundation, is an invaluable aid to all of us in the field. The superb results of his photographic campaign are now housed in the Photo Archives at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., where Karen Weinberger stands ready to provide scholars with copies. I thank her for her kind and very attentive assistance. In Rome I was always given the utmost support when working at the Bibliotheca Hertziana, the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, and the Archivio Segreto Vaticano. And my debt to my muse is without measure. xi</page><page sequence="10">xii PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY In the following discussions I proceed chronologically, selecting from among della Valle's works examples that strike me as interesting, even provocative, occasions for different kinds of critical appraisal. I readily confess to an eclectic approach to interpretation. Because Italian eighteenth-century sculpture has not been the subject of a great deal of critical exposition, I experiment with different kinds of approaches. I hope that my suggestive readings of della Valle's works can lead to further and more detailed critical investigations of the art of the Roman settecento.</page><page sequence="11">Preface Unlike the "divine" Michelangelo and the virtuosic Gianlorenzo Berini, Filippo della Valle was no hero to his own age, nor to subsequent ones for that matter. Aside from short articles by Hugh Honour and Vittorio Moschini, virtually no one had written about della Valle before I under- took the task of studying him during my graduate years. Della Valle was one of those ideal dissertation topics, an artist largely overlooked by centuries of writers, but with a substantial corpus of works executed with great finesse, most of which remain in their original locations in Roman churches. Rome's rich archives and libraries contain troves of informa- tion about "unknowns," so that my task of gathering together the inediti, producing photographs, and of writing a dissertation moved along rela- tively smoothly and quickly. The purpose of this present study is to bring together the results of my two decades of research on della Valle since completing my dis- sertation, to present the photographs of his works for the first time in published form, and to go into considerably more detail than anyone has done before about his career and its necessary connections with the patrons, institutions, and artistic conventions of eighteenth-century Rome. I try to tell several stories in this study of della Valle. The story of his own life and artistic career carries the narrative from early to latest works, of which I discuss representative examples in the first part of the text. The world of popes, a papal nephew, Vatican officials, nobility, religious orders, and a secret agent provides the setting for della Valle's story and his artistic production. In addition, there are the political and religious climate of the eternal city, the situation of the papacy's resisting and embracing reform, adopting some enlightenment ideas while reject- ing most, moving serenely and with ritual through the daily life of an age and of a city whose importance had shifted from that of leadership to one of preservation of past glories. As I have mentioned, della Valle was no hero. He did not stand head and shoulders above his contemporaries, nor did his work have the boldness of Pietro Bracci, Camillo Rusconi, or even his uncle Giovanni Battista Foggini. Not that della Valle's sculpture is meek, but it is mild and peaceful. It is that very calmness and (apparent) unassertiveness that discloses so much about the circumstances of the competing power structures and artistic impulses in eighteenth-century Rome. Filippo della Valle's "low profile" was no act of disingenuousness or false modesty.</page><page sequence="12">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY He was a good worker for the nobility, the papacy, the papal court, and religious organizations. At the same time, the charm and appeal of his sculpture can be seen to undermine the systems of ideas and beliefs that it purports to sustain and advocate. This is not to say that della Valle was a subversive; far from it. The insistence in his art upon a kind of aesthetic gesture and self-reflexivity, a self-containment that frustrates spectator- ship-all this leads to an abnegation of Roman Catholic sculpture's traditional ability to carry messages about a broad religious culture. This semiotic abjuration or almost evasive quality is, in fact, what the patrons seemed to favor. In comparison with the immediately preceding two or three centuries, there were far fewer tendencies in early to mid- eighteenth-century Rome to celebrate the greater glory of God and the Church, at least with the same vigor as one had seen earlier. The sculp- tural style of Filippo della Valle echoes a hesitancy and guardedness on the part of the dominant classes in Rome, a disinclination to provoke among populace and visitors a reaction to an overzealous, inquisitorial, and grandiloquent Church. Filippo della Valle's Life, Work, and Style Filippo della Valle's life (1698-1768) and productive career span much of that singular Roman period known in general history as counter- enlightenment, ancien regime, or Tridentine and in art history as late baroque, barocchetto, or rococo.1 The dreamy mood, soft relaxation, seductive stylishness, impish playfulness, and passive tranquillity2 that art historians have come to associate with eighteenth-century art in general and, specifically, the art of Rome in the first half of the settecento all characterize Filippo della Valle's sculpture. Sweet and gentle, intro- verted and unassuming, delicate and refined figures populate his sculp- tural ensembles. There is little greatness or sweeping drama in his tombs or in his single figures; instead, della Valle's aesthetic universe has more in common with withdrawal and calm allegories than it does with either the baroque of Bernini or the Renaissance of Michelangelo. Perhaps because he never aspired to the heroic dimensions of earlier generations, his sculpture has gone relatively unnoticed. In the interests of tying Filippo della Valle directly to his milieu, both sculptural and more generally cultural, rather than to stylistic categories invented by later art historians, I avoid the terms late baroque, barocchetto, and rococo in my text. 2 I discuss this specific phrase below, pp. 17ff. 2</page><page sequence="13">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE In 1768, the year of Filippo della Valle's death, Joseph Baretti commented on the "mistakes of some travelers" to Italy.3 His purpose was to defend Italian art and culture against the animadversions of certain Englishmen, especially Samuel Sharp, who, along with Joseph Addison and Charles de Brosses, viewed Italy as a museum of former glories, where the beauty of the past was not disturbed by thoughts of present or future. Baretti was author of the famous Italian-English dictio- nary, interpreter of Italian mores to the English public, and friend of Samuel Johnson (as well as the principal player in a scandalous murder; but that is another story). He also was Italian, and Italy was thought by some during the Enlightenment to be an intellectual and artistic back- water; indeed, there existed even in Rome a sense that the centers of culture had shifted to Paris with its great academies and to the intellec- tually and politically liberal England.4 When surveying the status of Italian art, Baretti reported to his English friends that della Valle, although perhaps not comparable with Michelangelo, was the leading sculptor in Rome and, along with a few other artists, was "looked upon as tolerably ingenious," produced work that did not "betray servile imitation," and had "some power of inven- tion."5 The author's demonstration of understatement does not so much moderate della Valle's status as legitimize Baretti's recently adopted British point of view and reflect the value of a class and age that no longer was sure of what constituted "great" art. The politically and intel- lectually conservative Baretti also mentions the traditional but perhaps by now outwor Renaissance valorization of invenzione and depreciation of a derivative or "servile" manner of imitation.6 His characterization of 3 Joseph Baretti, An Account of the Manners and Customs of Italy; with observations on the mistakes of some travelers, Vol. 1. London: 1768) pp. 275-276. 4 The most recent and detailed treatment of settecento Rome is Hanns Gross, Rome in the Age of Enlightenment (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990). Gross agrees that much of eighteenth-century culture was a product of historical entropy, of a decline in cultural vision and energy. 5 Baretti, Loc. cit. A Mr. Semple, one of the many spies for the British on the Old Pretender in Rome, wrote to Consul Skinner at Leghorn in 1732 that "there are at present no very famous statuarys at Rome ...." Ellis Waterhouse, "Rome in 1733," Italian Studies, XVII, 1962, 49. Because Della Valle was just beginning his Roman career in the early 1730s, it is not surprising that he received no mention from Semple, who in any event would be unlikely to favor a sculptor in the employ of the Corsinis. 6 Benedetto Menzini, in his "Arcadia Returned to Arcadia," a discourse given in the Parhassian woods (on the slopes of the Janiculum in Rome) in 1692 gave expression to a 3</page><page sequence="14">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY della Valle as (tolerably) "ingenious" attests to the sculptor's natural talents and facility with his art. Like invention, ingegno is a native Italian and Renaissance term in the language of art. Baretti was not suggesting that della Valle demonstrated genius in the enlightenment or romantic sense. Further, Baretti's slight depreciation of della Valle's art in the face of earlier sixteenth- and seventeenth-century examples need not elicit our agreement; yet, it testifies to the situation of art criticism within the broad European currents of the later eighteenth century. Earlier touchstones of value persisted, but provided rather poor tools for an examination of the status of contemporary sculpture. Filippo Baldinucci, della Valle's biographer and therefore a highly interested party, pointedly remarked that the sculptor was not inferior to the most renowned masters of the present or of previous ages (see Appendix III). But, as George Kubler might say, della Valle suffered from a "bad entrance" in the sense that the foundational work in public sculpture, whether of allegorical figures, funeral monuments, or portraits, had already been done. Della Valle apparently arrived on the Roman scene, through no fault of his own of course, at the end of a tradition.7 He did not add anything startlingly new, so he has not been highly valued by those critics steeped in Renaissance and romantic sensibilities or in the critical values of High Modernism. The question of della Valle's derivations from earlier artists and his status as an "epigone"-insofar as this "question" is really an act of art historical dismissal-may be dismissed rather quickly, I believe. Characterizing della Valle's art as entirely borrowed and unoriginal, or as an instance of the barocchetto, a prettified style that holds down a stylis- tic space between the baroque and neoclassicism, brings up the art histor- ical convention of establishing a canon of greatness based upon ideas of invention, genius, comparison with Michelangelo, and imitation of other artists. When Rudolf Wittkower writes that "Filippo della Valle, for all notion of "novelty" or originality that is fairly typical of settecento poetics: "As far as I can tell, however, the truth is that such novelty is not supposed to consist in saying something that has never been said before by anyone, but by saying it in a particular way." Brian Dooley (ed. and trans.), Italy in the Baroque (New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1995) p. 612. 7 George Kubler, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1962). The notion of the "bad entrance" fits well with both progressive and modernist concepts of art, neither of which is very useful when critiquing eighteenth-century sculpture. 4</page><page sequence="15">LIFE. WORK. AND STYLE his engaging and craftsman-like qualities, was an epigone"8 (because his relief style "owes" much to Algardi and Guidi), he too adheres to a model in which to derive something from another is to discredit oneself, what Baretti referred to as "servile imitation." Such words as epitome and epigone, progenitor and progeny are anchoring terms in debates of influence, derived attributes, imitatio (as in the imitation of predecessors), and greatness. As Lisa Tickner has characterized some of the favorite language of art history, we as art historians deal in metaphors: the "fluvial" metaphors-"those of currents, sources, confluences, influences" and heritage metaphors- "images of debt, exchange, borrowing, ancestors, kinship, and inheritance."9 It strikes me that these metaphors no longer serve the discipline of art history very well. Michael Baxandall discerns that influence, as a critical term, is often used in an insipid way by art historians. " 'Influence' is a curse of art criticism primarily because of its wrong-headed grammatical preju- dice about who is the agent and who is the patient: it seems to reverse the active/passive relation which the historical actor experiences and the inferential beholder will wish to take into account. ... To think in terms of influence blunts thought by impoverishing the means of differentia- tion."10 Raymond Williams also comments upon the not-so-veiled value judgments commonly found in discussions of influence and custom when he writes that " 'tradition' survives in English as a description of a general process of handing down, but there is a strong and often predom- inant sense of this entailing respect and duty ... ."I What Baxandall and Williams suggest is that we unnecessarily denigrate followers and descendants (as in della Valle following Donatello, Michelangelo, Bernini, Algardi, Foggini, and Rusconi) when in fact such a person may find himself or herself in a strong position. He or she can, because of the 8 Rudolf Wittkower, Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750 (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1973) p. 438. 9 Lisa Tickner, "Feminism, Art History, and Sexual Difference," Genders, 3, November 1988, p. 108. 10 Michael Baxandall, Patterns of Intention: On the Historical Explanation of Pictures (New Haven : Yale University Press, 1985) pp. 58-59. Baxandall's contempt for "influence" is further reflected in his complaint that he "must spend a couple of pages trying to kick [influence] just enough out of my road to pass on." 1I Raymond Williams, Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985) pp. 268-269. 5</page><page sequence="16">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY richness of resources, act upon tradition in ways unimaginable to prede- cessors; in fact, the artist can play upon and critique the passive Renais- sance and baroque artistic cultures.12 I suggest that della Valle should not be considered, either because of his historical circumstance or because of his particular "entrance" into the historical sequence, as an epitome-the essence or compendium of a form-nor an epigone-"the less distinguished succes- sor of an illustrious generation," as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it. And I wish to avoid the model of progenitor/progeny, a model so dear to discourses on excellence, eminence, prominence, and fame.13 In the following discussions I proceed chronologically, selecting from among della Valle's works examples that strike me as interesting, even provocative, occasions for different kinds of critical appraisal. I readily confess to an eclectic approach to interpretation. Because Italian eighteenth-century sculpture has not been the subject of a great deal of critical exposition, I experiment with different kinds of approaches. I hope that my suggestive readings of della Valle's works can lead to further and more detailed critical investigations of the art of the Roman settecento. 12 Baxandall, loc. cit., (p. 59) poses an interesting series of synonyms for turning the normal progenitor/progeny line of "influence" on its head: "If we think of Y [the progeny] rather than X [the progenitor] as the agent, the vocabulary is much richer and more attractively diversified: draw on, resort to, avail oneself of, appropriate from, have recourse to, adapt, misunderstand, refer to, pick up, take on, engage with, react to, quote, differentiate oneself from, assimilate oneself to, assimilate, align oneself with, copy, address, paraphrase, absorb, make a variation on, revive, continue, remodel, ape, emulate, travesty, parody, extract from, distort, attend to, resist, simplify, reconstitute, elaborate on, develop, face up to, master, subvert, perpetuate, reduce, promote, respond to, trans- form, tackle . .--everyone will be able to think of others." Baxandall finds the word "influence" anemic and prefers the notion of "tradition" as what "I take to be not some aesthetical sort of cultural gene but a specifically discriminating view of the past in an active and reciprocal relation with a developing set of dispositions and skills acquirable in the culture that possesses this view. But influence I do not want to talk about." Tradition as Baxandall conceives of it is not unrelated to intertextuality, but is more limiting because of his implication through a "discriminating view" that artistic choices are, more or less, conscious. Such a point of view would be for the intertextualist too reductive. 13 I prefer to see della Valle as an "intertextualist." See my discussion of the figure of Temperance in the Corsini Chapel beginning on page 37. I am writing a separate article about intertextuality and art history. 6</page><page sequence="17">LIFE. WORK, AND STYLE FLILIPPO DELLA VALLE (FIGURE 1), SON OF FRANCESCO, was bor the day after Christmas, 1698, in Florence.'4 We know from his last will and testament that he profited from reading the classics, both in Greek and Latin. This suggests that della Valle received a good education, probably at one of the many Jesuit academies in Florence. Although nothing is known about his father, his mother apparently was sister to the sculptor Giovanni Battista Foggini. Della Valle's biographers Francesco Baldinucci and Niccolo Gabburri relate that Foggini was della Valle's first master15; further, the Serie degli uomini i piui illustri reports that della Valle in his early Florentine years "modeled the most beautiful statues of the Royal Gallery [the Uffizi]," and Gabburri adds "and those most singular [works] that exist in great number scattered about the city of Florence."16 The sculptures that della Valle studied and modeled were undoubtedly part of the collection of works brought to the Uffizi from the Villa Medici in Rome by Ferdinando I, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1549-1609). As had been true for centuries, copying and making casts from ancient statues formed an important part of a young sculptor's training in the eighteenth century. It 14 Hugh Honour, "Filippo della Valle," Connoisseur, CXLIV, 1959, p. 173, mentions a note by M. Oretti in Aggiunta di molti Professori di Pittura, Scultura e Architettura . . non nominati dall'Orlandi, IX, 40 (Biblioteca Communale, Bologna, MSS. B. 140), which puts della Valle's birth in Florence on 26 December 1698. The Serie degli Uomini, XII, 1775, p 74, also gives his birthdate as 1698. The date of della Valle's death is given as 29 April 1768 by G. Bottari in a footnote to a letter (Bottari and Ticozzi, Raccolta di Lettere (VI, 1822), p. 174, in which Bottari states that della Valle "morto questo anno, 1768 ai 29 Aprile, d'anni 72." This death date, when he would not yet have completed his seventieth year, is confirmed in 30 Notari CC., Testamnenta, Rubrica, 1764-1772 in the Archivio Storico Capitolino (Rome) in which the record of death is "Philippus Valle, 29 April 1768-Tondus CC."

Whether one reads Pliny the Elder, Alberti, Leonardo, or Lodovico Dolce, one finds long discussions of ways in which the artist can imitate. Mimesis is not the slavish copying of nature, although such late twentieth-century sculptors as John DeAndrea and Duane Hanson do approach a form of the "representation" of direct copying. These latter artists critique the issues of aesthetic distance, mechanical reproduction, the "original" model, and the role of nature in art (and that is but a partial list). Della Valle, probably far less self-conscious or aware of the category of art, at least in our modem sense, and the status of imitation, followed his master's advice and studied the antique, because, as Lodovico Dolce had written in the cinquecento, "... ancient statues contain all the perfections of art and are examples of all that is beauti- ful."17 The imitatio auctorum of antiquity-imitate the best models and the best masters-was of signal importance in the education of the artist until modem times. Filippo della Valle was a thoroughly professional artist working within the confines of the academic tradition. He was no more interested in the mere imitating of nature than he was in being an artistic rebel, at least an obvious or self-conscious one. When Bellori disdained Caravag- gio as an "anthropographos"-a simple describer of men as they are, a hack who can only see what lies before his eyes-he was invoking that suspicion of a descriptive and defiant realism that flaunts rules and "il bello ideale." Della Valle's interests were indeed in the hallowed traditions of the skilled and learned artist. Refinement and the beautiful ideal were perfectly acceptable to him, and he wished to learn from his teachers (although he was not above critiquing and undermining them) and the "best" examples of antiquity. He was, in the Renaissance and baroque traditions, "eclectic." Distinguishing between a Florentine and a Roman sensibility involves some art historical sleight of hand. It is, nonetheless, one of the foundations of art historical discourse that we try to sort out "schools," and this arranging indeed involves making judgments about morphology and place. In my arguments about intertextuality (see below, pp. 37-39 ff.) I question some of the very methods I occasionally employ. Having 17 Lodovico Dolce, Dialogo della pittura intitolato I'Aretino (Florence: M. Nestenus e F.

A clearly articulated Florentine manner of presentation always informed his works more conspicuously than Roman monumentality. Nonetheless, there is a connection, through Giovanni Battista Foggini (1652-1725)- della Valle's uncle and teacher-and Foggini's master Ercole Ferrata (1610-1686), to the Roman styles of Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) and Alessandro Algardi (1596-1654). Ferrata had worked under Bernini on the Baldacchino and had succeeded Algardi at S. Nicola da Tolentino in Rome (next to the eventual location of della Valle's studio). Giovanni Battista Foggini had spent three years at the Accademia Fiorentina nell'Urbe, a Florentine academy founded by the Grand Duke Cosimo III and housed in Rome's Palazzo Madama. Foggini was there for three years, from 1673 to 1676, and stud- ied under Ercole Ferrata and Ciro Ferri, the two directors. According to Nava Cellini, Foggini trained in a circle of epigones, that second genera- tion of artists purveying a style whose original masters-especially Bernini-were no longer present.18 She comments on the overabundance of decorative elements and the heavy-handed, even excruciating, manipulation of planes and surfaces. Setting aside for the moment some of the pejorative implications for a sculptor of being burdened by an outmoded and highly expressive style, we can at least agree, I believe, that Foggini's style was imbued with the Roman high baroque, a sculptural style comparable in its flourish, ornament, and declamatory function to the epideictic mode of oratory. Foggini's Mass of St. Andrea Corsini (1685-1691, Florence, S. Maria del Carmine, Corsini Chapel, figure 2) is an early work and there- fore is closer to the styles of the preceding generation. It embodies the conventions of gesture, placement, and expression in the august tradition of baroque sculpture. Corsini opens his arms and looks to the miraculous image of Mary and the Christ Child; subsidiary characters also register an awareness, in a fairly typical baroque fashion, of the extraordinary 18 Antonia Nava Cellini, La Scultura del Seicento (Turin: UTET, 1982) p. 154: "L'impronta dell'istruzione ricevuta a Roma, in un ambiente non piu animato dalla presenza dei primi grandi creatori, la cui opera era il riflesso di ideali sentiti con profon- dita di convinzione e di polemica, ambiente dominato invece dagli epigoni, occupati principalmente a ripetere e difondere uno stile convenzionale di grande successo, in una generale esteriorita, rimane come un marchio negative nel lavoro del Foggini in marmo e di grande misrua.

Figures are ample, assertive, and grave, which is what we would expect from a large sculptural relief produced near the end of the seventeenth century in Florence. The heaviness of Foggini's Roman style is nonetheless somewhat relieved by his long experience in Florence. The manner in which Foggini renders individual drapery patterns is less congested and convoluted than might be found in the Roman high baroque. The Florentine sense of the articu- lated, crisply rendered fold is strong in Foggini and is carried over in the sculpture of his nephew della Valle. The impression of a visually intelli- gible disegno, as opposed to the more "painterly" and optical rendering of drapery that comes out of the school of the late Berini, constitutes a persistent element in Florentine style.'9 Filippo della Valle in Rome When Clement XI Albani issued his Bull Vineam Domini in 1705, it was reviewed in France by an assembly of bishops and abbots. The purpose of this Bull was to condemn once again Jansenist heresies. The French committee responded in agreement with the Bull, but stated that the bishops' judicial power was necessary for the approval of such declara- tions. Clement's response to the French bishops took them to task for questioning papal authority. "But since, in the words of St. Leo the Great, no building can endure unless it rest on the rock of which the Lord made the foundation, see whether this is not the explanation why, after the lapse of so many years, true peace never prevailed in your churches and never can prevail, unless the prestige of the Roman See be raised in order to overthrow error."20 By the time of Clement XI's death in 1721, one could easily perceive that the Holy See's political influence had ebbed. Despite this weakening of the political situation, however, the popes remained ardent supporters of architecture, sculpture, and painting, with hopes that the belli arti could sustain, in part at least, their prestige. Clement's reference to a great building resting upon the rock of the Lord is an apt metaphor for artistic patronage in the eighteenth century. Christopher Johns has commented about the connection between papal politics and artistic patronage in the early settecento: "Financially and 19 G.

The impact of eighteenth-century political culture-not just the pope's political agenda-is not easily quantifiable. Nor can we clearly assess (or so it seems to me) the success or failure of official artistic culture, especially as it may have moved (or even nudged) political circumstances in settecento Rome. Yet it is fairly clear that Della Valle served an ancien regime culture that stood for (although it was careful not to insist too dramatically upon) permanence, authority, paternalism, and the entire ideology of the Roman Catholic Church. The surest way to social advancement in Rome and the Papal States was to have a career in the Church,22 and the best source of commissions was from within the Church. Della Valle would have understood eighteenth- century Roman civilization intuitively, and he would have responded to it as something as natural as the air that he breathed. But what was natural and utterly acceptable to Filippo della Valle became anathema to his son Claudio, who wrote of "the popular faith, the blind and brutal faith, the spurious faith, the idle faith that one finds in these men [Christian hypocrites] who follow Christianity more out of habit than reason."23 Claudio was jailed for several years in the 1790s because of his rabidly anticlerical and prodemocracy views. But that was the son. From what we know of the father-by reading his last will and testament, for instance-he was a believer and a man of humility, one who cared greatly for his immediate and extended family and, especially, for his beloved wife Sylvia. Notwithstanding the strongly held opinion that enlightenment ideas weakened the Church-especially in France-there is little evidence that freethinking posed a threat to the papacy in settecento 21 Christopher M.

With typical enlightenment exaggeration, Duclos wrote that "of all empires, that of the intellectual world is the most powerful ... In the long run it molds public opinion." But there does not seem to have been any overwhelming intellectual attack on the Church in Rome itself in the early to middle years of the century. Indeed, the Church was the "intellectual world." Public opinion, in a city whose population was largely supported by the papacy, did not run counter to ecclesiastical interests. The ideas of the philosophes were not unknown in the Eternal City (Voltaire was a respectful and gracious correspondent with Benedict XIV, for instance),24 but the influence of the pope in spiritual matters continued more-or-less unabated throughout most of the eighteenth century. The Jesuits, although eradicated in the 1770s, were favorites of many of the earlier eighteenth-century popes, most notably Benedict XIV, and the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda, which they largely directed, functioned much as it had in the previous century to engender and protect the faith in "heathen" lands. The papacy, the religious orders, and the nobility supported the arts and dominated culture. There is the incident of the suppression of the Freemasons in Rome, but neither the organization nor its "abolition" had much effect. The Freemasons were widely believed to be a conspiratorial association whose aim was to subvert religion and promote libertinism and godless- ness. The branch in Rome was, in all probability, opposed to the Stuarts', and therefore to the pope's, interests. It is likely that the rejection of one of the Stuart spies in Rome, Thomas Dereham (see below, pp. 53 to 56), from membership in the Freemasons was the final act prompting Clement XII to issue his Bull in eminenti in 1738 (to be reasserted little more than a decade later by Benedict XIV's Bull Providas Romanorum). But as one member of the now clandestine organization was to remark, the Freemasons continued to meet "almost without concealment."25 And however eminently reasonable were Clement's reasons for abolishing the Freemasons, they threatened virtually nothing in the organization and operation of the Church. 24 As much as he liked the philosophe from Ferney (who had dedicated his play Mahomet to the pope), Benedict did not hesitate to condemn Voltaire's heresies. 25 As reported in H.

Dent &amp; Sons Ltd., 1964) p. 65. 14</page><page sequence="25">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE Rome of the settecento was still a Tridentine city, as it had been a century earlier, with the Church's powers of persuasion directed by patrons and artists whose tastes now were for the elegant and the restrained. Papal and religious patronage remained strong, but did not demand an aggressive and exuberant style typical of the baroque. Hans Gross, among others, characterizes eighteenth-century Roman culture as "ancien regime." He writes specifically of the city suffering from what he calls the "Post-Tridentine Syndrome": "The characteristic of this syndrome will be a slow and gradual loss of active energy, marked, among other features, by a perceptible, if not always overt, secularization and the loss of the associative mode of action inspired and inculcated at Trent, with intermittent efforts at reversing the trend. In general, there is a certain amount of inertia and disorder, but no willful retrogression. In other words, the weakness is not clerical goverment per se, as used to be asserted by anticlericals, but as clerical government that had lost its overall integrative vision and direction."26 (Although the usage "Post- Tridentine" is common, technically the Roman Church remained in its Tridentine mode until the Vatican Councils of the 1960s). Gross' histori- cal model for the settecento is that of entropy: the vigor and unity of the seventeenth century gives way in the eighteenth to a failure, a collapse of will and intention. The spirit of the earlier age slackens; the papal government loses both its counter-reformatory zeal and its presence in European affairs. For instance, popes no longer find their mediating services required by European heads of state, in large part because they were perceived to favor automatically the interests of a Roman Catholic country over those of Protestant governments. Indeed, Italy nearly alone among the European powers did not undergo a Protestant reformation. With the reduction of worldly power and the retrenchment of papal government against the ideas of "illuminismo"-resulting in a Counter- Enlightenment in settecento Rome-neither the city's nor the papacy's position in the politics and culture of the eighteenth century were any longer combative. The Counter-Enlightenment defines a protective (and rather low-key) attitude toward the Church's authority and a belief in revealed truths.27 Not surprisingly, the visual rhetoric of the period often 26 Gross, op. cit., p. 11.

In a complex and dialectical fashion, the manners, tastes, customs, and styles of the nobil- ity, the papal court, along with the cognoscenti and indendenti reflect, assist, and constitute the political reality and visual culture of an enor- mously important but governmentally isolated city. Venturi has written about settecento Rome (with perhaps too much license) that "At Rome, one dreamed of living during the reign of Augustus. Instead, this was a discredited state, without manufacture, without commerce, without prestige."28 But the Augustan dream lived on. The Italian historian Carlo Denina, writing in the mid-eighteenth century, said that the Italian sette- cento was comparable to "the famous centuries of Augustus, Leo X, or Urban VIII and Galileo."29 Whether or not Denina's assertion constitutes anything more than wishful thinking is a matter for debate among histo- rians; this very affirmation, however, reveals an intellectual point of view of the time. Certainly there was little or no commerce or manufacture, but to describe Rome as without prestige and as absolutely discredited distorts the picture we find of an enormously vital city, a papacy intermit- tently concerned with progress and reform, and a healthy if not affluent artistic community. The central administration of the Church had been strengthened in the wake of the Council of Trent, and remained powerful and largely resistant to change throughout the eighteenth century. Only in the 1790s did the papacy institute tax reform, for instance, but by then it was too little and too late to avoid the crises that arose at the end of the century. Rome was not a center of commerce, but functioned rather as the admin- istrative nucleus of the Church. The land surrounding the city was in large part marshy and noxious, and the fields that could produce grain were controlled by absentee landowners. The price of bread was fixed by the papacy, so that the contadini remained impoverished while the city profited from an artificially low price for foodstuffs. With generous tithes preclude an identifiable Catholic Enlightenment, however. I suggest in several parts of the text ways in which enlightenment ideas had a direct impact upon Roman culture in these years. 28 "A Roma si sognava ancora d'essere al tempo di Augusto. Invece era uno stato scredi- tato, senza manifatture, senza commercio, senza prestigio." F.

It is my contention that the sculptural style of Filippo della Valle is appropriate for eighteenth-century Rome in a way that neither the late baroque of Pietro Bracci nor the growing taste for a new classicism could possibly be. Della Valle's art situates itself within and accommodates the cultural matrix of settecento Rome. There are many sources to an artist's individ- ual style, of course: there are religious beliefs, tradition, convention, expectations of patrons, individual personality and ability, reaction against the previous style and the style of the teacher, as well as the artist's more-or-less unconscious response to the dominant institutions and classes of his own lifetime. In the case of Filippo della Valle, there is the organization that defined his spiritual and artistic identity, the Roman Catholic Church, and his adopted city of Rome, whose "visual culture" found apt expression in his tombs, reliefs, and monumental statues. I adopt the phrase "passive tranquillity" knowing full well that the contrary notion of an "active tranquillity" is rather odd, if not utterly meaningless. Just the same, to delineate della Valle's artistic personality in a passive mode draws our attention to those conservative elements in his art. In a progressive age such as the baroque, conservative artists tend to be devalued. No one could compare della Valle to his sixteenth- and seventeenth-century counterparts Michelangelo and Bernini and expect to see the same level of "genius" we often ascribe to those protean and legendary figures. Della Valle did not lead his age in the direction of new, stupefying, or marvelous forms.33 He was no innovator. There is the 30 Spencer M. Di Scala, Italy: From Revolution to Republic: 1700 to the Present (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1995) pp. 9-11. 31 Denina, op. cit., p. 1279: "Lo Stato ecclesiastico e il Veneto godettero nell'interno profonda pace, e continuarono in quella condizione in cui gli abbiamo osservati nel secolo precendente." 32 Carpanetto and Ricuperati, op. cit. p. 312: "[Denina] comments on the somewhat passive tranquillity of the Papal States and the Venetian Republic." 33 D. Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981) remains the best source for such terms as meraviglia, ingegno, and stupore. 17</page><page sequence="28">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY cliche in art history that an artist who brought nothing especially new to his medium is all the more "representative" of his age, much more so than the reformist artist. Although I find many of the formulations of how an artist "represents" his or her age-as some sort of mirror, simulacrum, or epiphenomenon of a geist-somewhat mystifying and even at times awkward, I do accept that there is an historical difference between della Valle and Berini. That difference is not owing simply to the fact that della Valle was not Bemini's equal either in terms of invention and skill or in terms of the power of his presence in Rome. It has more to do with an absence of activeness, apparent aggressiveness, or a heroic quality. As della Valle's sculpture does indeed address the public, I write often of his "rhetoric." Notwithstanding the fact that the connection between the visual arts and rhetoric has not been so clearly drawn as, say, that between poetry and rhetoric, it strikes me as a useful association nonetheless. Della Valle's sculpture is public and hortatory, the kind of visual expression meant for the occasion of communal meditation upon someone's death (tombs) or confronting the values of an allegorical representation. But despite the civic and religious nature of his forms- and therefore their technical attachment to the epideictic form of oratory-his rhetoric is decidedly quiet, understated, and subtle. When John Stuart Mill wrote in the early nineteenth century that "eloquence is to be heard, poetry to be overheard," he was suggesting that poetic language seems not to have an intended listener. But we listen to (and read) poetry nonetheless. Perhaps the same is true of della Valle's sculp- tural rhetoric. His tombs, allegorical figures, and putti "address" the public by virtue of their stony, cute, and impassive but insistent presence-a presence now in its third century. But their public address tends to be that of self-absorption rather than that of theatricality. In such a sense, I believe, della Valle's figures are passive. And tranquil. Insofar as the concept of tranquillity can attain to philosophical status, it is associated with stoic and Epicurean virtues. Inner peace, serene joy, and a withdrawal from worldly pursuits or goal-seeking mark the demeanor and attitude of stoics and epicures and, I believe, eighteenth-century Roman Catholics. At least some in della Valle's audi- ence felt themselves secure in their faith, unconcerned with the poignant philosophical disturbances of the enlightenment, and found themselves willing adherents to a religious attitude that finds the right and the good in tranquillity.34 They were apt to "overhear" della Valle's sculpture. 34 The mood of the Roman eighteenth century was, in part at least, a product of current philosophical and poetic notions expressed by the Accademia degli Arcadi.

And, like his uncle, he would have been urged by Grand Duke Cosimo III to align himself with the Florentine academy in Rome. His successes in Rome came quickly. He shared first-prize honors with Pietro Bracci in the Accademia di San Luca's ceremony 11 trionfo delle tre nobili e belle arte of 1725,36 and then, not yet ready to join the Academy as a master, went to Bracci's mentor, Camillo Rusconi, with whom he remained until Rusconi's death in 1728. As early as 1726 della Valle was living with the sculptor Giovanni Battista Maini in a house on the Discesa di S. Isidoro.37 According to Baldinucci, della Valle "received a fine reputation and much profit" from his three-year association with Rusconi.38 And when Della Valle was later to write Rusconi's biography for Giovanni Bottari he commented that he had learned from Rusconi "both from his voice and from the example of his works."39 Della Valle's first-known work in Rome, the terra-cotta relief of Josiah Assigning Money for the Temple (Plate 1), demonstrates the remarkable accomplishment of this young sculptor even before he work- ed with Rusconi. Francesco Saverio Baldinucci's comment that (at about this time) della Valle warranted a kind of "summa cum laude" from the 35 For Foggini, see K.

Josiah consigns the money to carpenters and to other workmen for the repairing and rebuilding of the temple of Baal and Asherah. The subject can be seen as an encouragement of official patron- age. Josiah came to the throne of Judah as a mere eight-year-old, but soon grew to be a leader who conformed to the laws of God. He suppressed idolatry and rebuilt the temple. His workmen assisted him with perfect respect and fidelity to the task. The Accademia di San Luca must have found this story an exemplum virtutis for young artists. Artistic patronage with religious ends is virtuous; the workmen must carry out official and especially papal projects with constancy and devotion. For the composition, della Valle draws on his memory of Foggini's and Massimiliano Soldani's reliefs for the chapel in the Palazzo Sansedoni in Siena. Whether or not della Valle had traveled to Siena to see the reliefs (they had been completed in 1700 when della Valle was a small child), he probably knew them from Foggini's workshop. The crouching figure, seen from the back in the lower left comer of the foreground of della Valle's relief, derives from Foggini's relief of the Miracle of St. Ambrogio Sansedoni (figure 3). And the overall composition owes something to Soldani's relief of St. Ambrogio Sansedoni Presenting to the Pope a Model of Siena (1692-1700, Siena, Palazzo Sansedoni). The stooping figure is modeled nearly in the round and is anatomically full, smooth, and supple. Della Valle's perspicuous style, without agitation and with little drama, already announces his characteristically lucid manner of presentation. 40 See note 15.

Rusconi had studied with Foggini in Ferrata's studio, and had met with him in the later 'teens in Florence, when the young Filippo was undoubtedly already busy in his uncle's studio.4' Rusconi's major work in Rome of this period, just before he died, is the Memorial to Alexander Sobieski (figure 4, marble, 1727-1728), a high relief monument in the Roman church of Santa Maria della Concezione. Della Valle in his Life of Rusconi, describes this monument's unveiling on 4 October 1728, a mere two months before Rusconi's death. The Englishman John Breval visited Rusconi's studio when he was working on the Sobieski monument and judged it to be "of a Taste perfectly elegant." He also wrote, about a decade after Rusconi's death, that "I cannot leave Rome, without taking some Notice of so eminent a Man in his Way, as the late excellent Sculptor Camillo Rusconi. I saw him at his Chisel, with several young Elves about him, who express'd a generous Emulation."42 It is tempting (and reasonable) to imagine della Valle as one of the "young Eleves" emulating Rusconi. We know that Giovanni Battista Maini, who lived at the same address as della Valle, and Pietro Bracci were also working with Rusconi at this time. All three of these young students probably assisted the aging Rusconi on the monument. The one figure that strikes close to della Valle's Roman style is the putto to the left of Sobieski's crown (figure 5). The plump, winged, and caped child brushes away a tear as his snuffs the candle of life. The treatment of the hair, as it sweeps forward above the left ear and then loops over the fore- head, reminds one of della Valle's style. Of course, sculptors in eighteenth-century Rome loved the rendering of children as angels and putti, and it is not always easy to make secure judgments about individual style. Just the same, this marble figure looks like something della Valle could have done. His own style over the next four decades, although "lighter and less monumental" (as Robert Enggass characterizes it),43 nonetheless shows Rusconi's traces. It is an interesting footnote that 41 For Rusconi, see Robert Enggass, Early Eighteenth-Century Sculpture in Rome: an illustrated catalogue raisonne (Univrsity Park, Pennsylvania and London: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1976), vol.

What, we cannot help but wonder, did they talk about? Della Valle was literate, as we know from his biography of Rusconi and from his comment in his Testament that he left his Greek and Latin texts to his son Claudio because he had found much erudition in them (see Document II). With Rusconi's death, della Valle opened his own studio, which was-according to Gabburri-immediately above that of Rusconi's. In 1754 the Roman weekly newspaper Diario ordinario di Chracas reported that della Valle's studio was near the Church of San Nicola da Tolentino.44 Filippo della Valle's first public commission after Rusconi's death appears to be that of the bust of Carlo Cerri, which is in the Cerri Chapel of the church of I1 Gesiu (plates 2 and 3). The Cerri family had for generations been important members in one capacity or another of the Apostolic See. This Carlo Cerri, who died in 1726 (another Carlo Cerri, a Cardinal, died in 1690; his monument is next to this one, and has a portrait bust by Domenico Guidi) was an auditor or magistrate of the Court of the Rota, the Vatican's highest court of appeal. Della Valle presents him bust-length, dressed in his magistrate's attire, peering out from his frame toward the nave of the Jesuits' mother church. The conceit of a figure breaking its frame and engaging with the world of "real" time and events has a long history, one that in the recent past had been investigated by Bemini. His portrait of Gabriele Fonseca, staring intently from his "window frame" in the Fonseca Chapel of San Lorenzo in Lucina, Rome, probably interested della Valle. But the passage from the high baroque and grand siecle to the more unassuming and "natural" work of the eighteenth century dictated a less adamantly religious (Fonseca is awe-struck before the altar) expression. Cerri juts his head out of della Valle's elaborate aedicula-like setting (most likely designed by Pietro da Cortona) and seems to scrutinize the passing crowds, almost as if there were something he is watching for or someone in the congregation with whom he has business. Bernini's Cardinal Scipione Borghese focuses in a similar but much more concentrated manner. Della Valle's masterful handling of unruffled surfaces and 44 Chracas, Diario ordinario, 7 August 1754, locates della Valle's studio as "vicino alla Chiesa di S. Nicola da Tolentino a Capo le Case." Consistent numbering and naming of streets did not yet exist in eighteenth-century Rome. A given location was often associ- ated by its nearness to a church. The modern street Capo le Case is some distance from the church of S. Nicola da Tolentino. 25</page><page sequence="36">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY details brings into being the placid demeanor that deflates the marvelous and grand effects of baroque concettismo. The Academy of the Arcadians, settecento Rome's most active and organized intellectual community, admired this antibaroque style. Della Valle was a member of the Academy from at least 1743 until his death and bore the pastoral name Prassinoo Ateniense.45 In their disdain of secentismo, the Arcadians called for a style much like della Valle's: one that is clear, descriptive, free of astonishment and marvel, and reasonable. There was something about the baroque, with its sense of surprise, its fantastic quality, and its love of the meraviglia that was abhorrent to the new tastes of the eighteenth century. I duscuss in more detail some of the theoretical, literary, and political attitudes of the Accademia in the Epilogue. On the political side, there is the recent interpretation of the Arcadia as an instrument of the Roman Curia to manage and perhaps subdue the influence of the Enlightenment as its ideas threatened to seep into Rome. One can imagine Carlo Cerri, by appointment and profession a curialist and therefore a supporter of papal authority and ecclesiastical power, sagely agreeing with the effects of a widely influential movement that was controlled from behind the scenes by his own organization-the Vatican.46 In 1729 della Valle exhibited "un putto che dorme, di marmo" (now lost) at the exhibition of SS. Annunziata in Florence.47 There is little likelihood, however, that he actually lived in Florence, for he was about to be elected to the Roman Academy of Saint Luke. 45 Giorgetti Vichi, Anna Maria, Gli Arcadi dal 1690 al 1800 (Rome: Arcadia, Accademia letteraria italiana, 1977) p. 215. 46 Amadeo Quondam, "L'istituzione Arcadia.

Because Santi Luca e Martina was the home church of the academicians of St. Luke, this commission was probably tied to della Valle's formal acceptance into the Academy.48 Although the planning and execution of this relief would have preceded his entrance, its dedication coincided with the beginning of della Valle's association with the Academy. Gabburri had written that della Valle was responsible for two of the reliefs on the squinches of Santi Luca e Martina, but documentation in the church's archives clarify the story. First Giovanni Odazzi had proposed painting the four evangelists on the pendentives, but Camillo Rusconi's suggestion that the works be reliefs carried the day. He modeled figures in papier mache, but at his death in 1728 the commis- sion shifted once again, this time to the hands of his "Eleves": Giuseppe Rusconi, Giovanni Battista Maini, and Filippo della Valle. They worked from designs by Sebastiano Conca. The angels here are still somewhat heavy, reflecting the fresh influence of Rusconi and, perhaps, Conca. In Ezekial's prophetic ministry he experienced a vision: ". .. as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar... the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God." Della Valle's Angel holds open the text with the Latin inscription: ET A FACIES DEXTRIS LEONIS IPSORUM-"and the face of a lion on the right side" Ezekial goes on to describe the apparitional strokes of light: "As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like appearance of lamps; it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning, And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of light- ning." (Ezekial I, 10, 13-14) There was of course a long-standing tradi- tion of putting the symbols of the four evangelists on the squinches of a dome. The miraculous light that floods-in abets the illusion of Ezekial's miraculous vision, but as one might expect in the early years of the Roman eighteenth century, the visionary aspect of the Biblical text receives somewhat perfunctory support from the artists' styles. Because of the strongly antimarinist agenda of the Arcadians, artists, poets, musicians-anyone in the arts, for that matter-knew to avoid baroque conceits. Extended metaphors, quixotic or illusory imagery excited almost immediate condemnation. 48 The Accademia di San Luca voted him in on 4 June 1730; the vote was eleven in favor, one opposed.

Clement XII, who reigned from 1730 to 1740, claimed destitution upon his elevation to the Chair of St. Peter. He wrote that "the higher I rise the lower I get. As a priest I was rich. I became a bishop and was comfortably off. I became a cardinal and was poor. Now I am pope I am ruined."50 There may be a degree of disingenuousness here; his was an extremely wealthy and noble Florentine banking family. Just the same, he did spend generously during his pontificate for the Vatican library, for his family's palace in Rome, for the Corsini Chapel in San Giovanni in Laterano, and-with the aid of the lottery-for numerous projects throughout the eternal city. He bought Cardinal Albani's collection of imperial busts for the princely sum of 60,000 scudi. These portraits and other inscriptions were to form the heart of the collections of the Capitoline Museums, which were soon to open as one of Europe's first public museums. The Venetian ambassador wrote "Of all the embellishments of the Eternal City, this collection of ancient statues, inscriptions and reliefs on the capitol is the most important, the most sensible; by itself alone it would suffice to commend and endear to posterity the memory of Clement XII."51 Like his predecessor Benedict XIII Orsini and in the tradition of Italian princes, his power was to be expressed more in the arts than in European politics. When he became pope, Clement was nearing eighty.52 He suffered so many illnesses during the decade of his pontificate that his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini carried out much of his political program. And not always with success. At one point, the Papal States nearly were 49 Honour, loc. cit. 50 Owen Chadwick, The Popes and European Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981) p. 313 quotes Clement's biographer De Brosses. 51 Mocenigo; quoted in Freiherr Ludwig von Pastor, The History of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages, trans.

The Corsinis managed to keep them and avoid open military conflict by spending even more of the family's money. Clement's largesse extended to fellow Florentines. The poet Niccolo Ridolfi was Master of the Apostolic Palace. The architects Alessandro Galilei and Ferdinando Fuga received most of the commis- sions for new buildings, while Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Battista Maini, Agostino Comacchini, and Giuseppe Lironi flourished as sculp- tors. As Filippo Juvarra wrote in April 1732, in the city of Rome, "Tuscany exults and laughs."53 The Corsini Chapel Clement's single most impressive and costly act of patronage was for his family's chapel in the basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano. The more than 210,000 scudi that he spent on the project, although a sum that cannot be translated in any precise manner, would undoubtedly constitute an expenditure in the tens of millions of dollars in late twentieth-century money.54 Two Cardinal nipoti, Neri Corsini and Giovanni Antonio Guadagni, participated in the erection and maintaining of the chapel. Neri, in the old tradition of Cardinal nephews, was Clement's artistic supervisor and maggiordomo; Guadagni, his sister's son, pursued Clement's pastoral agendas.55 53 "L'Etruria esulta e ride," L. Rovere, V. Viale, A. E. Brinckmann, Filippo Juvarra (Milan: Casa editrice Oberdan Zucchi 1937) p. 96. Quoted in E. Kieven "Rome in 1732," Light on the Eternal City, ed. H. Hager and S. Scott Munshower (University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1987) p. 255. 54 Filippo della Valle wrote in his testament that should his wife wish to live separately from her children and therefore maintain an independent household after his death (he prayed to heaven that she would not wish to do so), she be provided 41/2 scudi per month. Making a rather large assumption that a scudo is worth about $200 in modern purchasing power-thereby allowing Elisabetta Sylvia Paziani somewhat less than $1,000 a month in living expenses (which hardly would be adequate in modem Rome)- 210,000 scudi becomes $42,000,000. As another way of calculating the worth of eigh- teenth-century money, we know that an English gentleman could live well and maintain a carriage on about ?200 per year in eighteenth-century Rome. Since it took about four scudi to buy a pound, we can calculate that the money spent on the Corsini Chapel would have supported nearly 300 milords in style for a year. 55 For the chapel, see Filippo Caraffa, "La Cappella Corsini nella basilica Lateranense (1731-1700)," Carmelus, vol. 21, 1974, pp. 281-338 and Elizabeth Kieven, "Uberlegun- gen zu Architektur und Ausstattung der Cappella Corsini," L'architettura da Clemente XI a Benedetto XIV: Pluralitc di tendenze (ed. E. Debenedetti) (Rome, 1989) pp. 69-91. 29</page><page sequence="40">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY On 28 October 1731 the Lateran ceded to pope Clement XII the location for erecting the Corsini family chapel, which was to be dedi- cated to Saint Andrea Corsini, a Carmelite Bishop of Fiesole (1349- 1374). Then in 1734 Clement promulgated a bull to establish four chap- lains to serve in the Corsini Chapel. It was his intention to keep this space as a sepulchral chapel and as a church for the Corsini family. Pope Clement, his nephew Neri, and another great nephew by the name of Andrea are all entombed in the Chapel. The last Corsini to be buried here was Tommaso Corsini (1767-1856), who was Senator of Rome in 1818 and again in 1847. The architect for the project was Clement's fellow Florentine Alessandro Galilei, a distant relation to the family of Galileo Galilei. Alessandro had met Neri Corsini in the late 'teens, and, at Corsini's re- quest (Neri Corsini was then diplomat and plenipotentiary in the service of Grand Duke Cosimo III), had returned from London to become court architect for the Medici.56 Because of the weakening of Medician patron- age and the straightened financial circumstance of this once illustrious family, the 1720s did not prove to be especially productive for Galilei. With the accession of Clement XII in 1730, however, Galilei's artistic fortunes increased dramatically. The Corsini hired Galilei for the new facade of San Giovanni in Laterano, as well as for the family chapel inside. Galilei designed Clement's chapel along the lines of the Cappella Sistina in Santa Maria Maggiore.57 The chapel follows a Greek cross plan, with dramatic coffering within the barrel vaults of the "transepts," and rich marble inlays of red (fior di pesco-marmor chalcidicum), green (verde antico-marmor thessalicum, marmor altracium), and purple. The effect is both chaste and ornate.58 As opposed to the baroque notion of 56 For Alessandro Galilei, see E.

The statues of the cardinal virtues, for which the pope (through his Cardinal Nipote and Galilei) paid 700 scudi each, were sculpted by Comacchini, Filippo della Valle, Giuseppe Lironi, and Giuseppe Rusconi. The reliefs were done by Lambert Sigismond Adam, Paolo Benaglia, Pietro Bracci, and Pierre L'Estache, each of whom were paid 400 scudi. Carlo Monaldi received 1,600 scudi for the statues on either side of the bronze figure of the pope, which was carved by Giovanni Battista Maini. For the two statues of Innocence and Penitence Bartolommeo Pincellotti was paid 900 scudi. Maini received 2,100 scudi for the statue of the pope and for the monument of Neri Corsini. Antonio Montauti sculpted the group of the Pieta, for which he was paid 1,600 scudi. The large relief of the Battle of Anghiari, by Comacchini, cost 1,550 scudi. The sculpture alone, therefore, cost in excess of 13,000 scudi. Della Valle's image of Temperance with two attendant putti (plates 18-21) occupies the area immediately to one's left upon entering the chapel. Enshrined in the basalt ur are the remains of Cardinal Andrea Corsini, the last of the Corsini cardinals, who died in 1795. Clement and Galilei's use of the virtues as anchoring points in the religious program for the chapel enacts a tradition of great ideological import. The four cardinal virtues-the so-called Stoic or Platonic tet- rad-have a literary history that reaches back to antiquity. In art, one can trace their depiction at least from Carolingian times. Della Valle's treat- ment enters into a sequence of considerable age, and therefore one may be tempted to dismiss his contribution as a matter of convention modified by personal style (especially in the handling of such matters as drapery, hair, and facial features); yet, seeing della Valle's participation in the allegorical tradition as relatively slight dismisses, I believe, much of the importance of the work. After all, convention has significance. The fact that he worked in this tradition fairly near its endpoint in European visual culture does not necessarily diminish the fullness of his contribution.60 59 This follows Kieven's argument, "Rome in 1732," loc. cit., (see note 53) pp. 257-258. 60 Eighteenth-century visual culture was weeding out allegorical representations (although they hung on in Rome well into the nineteenth century). In England there was a 31</page><page sequence="42">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY The idea of temperance is as old as the Delphic stones ("nothing in excess") and as "modem" as Freud (Civilization and its Discontents). Although a model Victorian virtue (and therefore primarily associated by Freud with sexual urges), and occasionally discredited in the twentieth century, Temperance has had its longest existence in the company of the cardinal or Platonic (Stoic) virtues. And it is in this sense that della Valle quoted Temperance: she is in the company of Courage, Justice, and Prudence. Plato in the Laws writes that "the temperate life is in all things gentle, having gentle pains and gentle pleasures." The allegorical figura- tion of Temperance pours water into wine, not for the purpose of denying the pleasure of wine, but so that the enjoyment may be mild. Thomas Aquinas associated Temperance with the sense of touch and our appetites; like Plato, he viewed Temperance not as abstinence, but, in a more positive light, as just measure. Although Cesare Ripa's Iconologia6' does not show Temperance in this guise, the tradition of diluting wine as a sober act can be found in medieval sacramentaries and in one of the cupola mosaics at San Marco in Venice (c. 1200), as well as in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. In spite of the fact that she personifies and acts out an idea that has no corporeal form beyond literary and artistic convention, della Valle makes her something other than a plagiarized appropriation or an egoless cypher who performs a witless action-in other words, he does some- thing in addition to presenting a stand-in for an abstract idea. Della Valle matches his style with the history of the idea of sophrosyne. Sophrosyne comes from the tradition of Greek virtues that Christian art appropriates and assumes unto itself. Helen North identifies sophrosyne by creating distinctions among other principles of human character and expression: "Among certain persistent themes that are discussed, the most important is the polarity between sophrosyne and the opposing principles- search for Hobbesian "truth" in poetry at the expense of allegorical 'exorbitancy." Ruchard Hurd wrote in Letters on Chivalry and Romance (1762), "What we have got by this revolution, you will say, is a great deal of good sense. What we have lost, is a world of fine fabling." 61 For Ripa see the new edition edited by Piero Buscaroli, with a preface by Mario Praz (Milan: Editori Associati, S.P.A, 1992). There is an unsigned document in the Carte Galilei (Archivio di Stato, Florence, C.G., Filza 14[N], Fasc. 1, 37-38) that identifies and describes the allegorical figures that are to be placed in the chapel. 32</page><page sequence="43">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE variously called andreia ('manliness'), to eugenes ('nobility'), to draste- rion (the 'active principle'), or megalopsychia ('greatness of soul')."62 Temperance is the virtue; sophrosyne the human behavior that makes it real. Virtue imbues the Christian soul with an earthly version of a divine attribute. Although humankind has been deformed by original sin, the virtues, especially in St. Gregory's view, reveal the potential for redemption. They are gifts of God's grace, and temperantia (which is the Latin term for the Greek sophrosyne) is closely identified with chastity, moderation of the appetites, sobriety, sanity, and restraint-all virtues of the papacy in the settecento and an attribute that the Arcadians would be likely to associate with the sober and elegant style of the eighteenth century in contradistinction to the somewhat more "inebriated" baroque. Writers on the papacy in the settecento emphasize the gentleness, temperance, kindliness, beneficence, and paternalism of the popes. They had little worldly power, even in their own city. One foreign ambassador was heard to say that "in Rome everyone gives orders and nobody obeys them, and really things work well enough."63 Owen Chadwick has writ- ten that "In a good-humoured age ... mostly good-humoured men led the Roman Catholic Church... ."64 There is an aptness, then, both in the Cor- sinis' choice of the virtues and of della Valle's manner of presentation. Della Valle's Temperance is so demure and self-denying that she looks away as she dilutes the wine. The baroque focuses attention on significant human action; the characters or personifications "know" what they are doing; intention and action are continuous. Della Valle's style fractures that kind of unity-and therefore "intentionally" misreads the baroque (a style that is to be found throughout the Lateran, especially in the Apostle Series along the nave)-by having this beautiful woman turn away. A putto watches her, as if monitoring the action. But he appears more curious than admonitory, and because we know there is a sexual- ization of della Valle's putti (although of a restrained and prettified nature, which of course can add immeasurably to their prurient and lubri- cious nature), we can infer a sexual interest here. Temperance masks, but not quite, her bared breast. 62 Helen North, Sophrosyne: Self-Knoweldge and Self-Restraint in Greek Literature (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1966) p. ix. 63 Maurice Andrieux, Daily Life in Papal Rome in the Eighteenth Century, trans.

Within the tradi- tional frame of reference, this as allegory is not particularly disturbing; yet, anything so soft and plush, cute and curious, quiet and shy evokes from the viewer a divided response. I suspect that there are some "missing" intertexts here that have to do with disquisitions on sexuality and the Church.65 As Freud argues, the very celibacy of Roman Catholic priests creates sublimated narratives of sublimated desires. Michel Foucault would say that we have a discourse on sexuality, as presented within setttecento terms, one that articulates moderation, sobriety (both literal and figurative), and self-awareness.66 This figure's sexuality would not have been lost on its contemporary audience (indeed, sexual restraint-even abstinence-is an important virtue); at the same time, it seems highly unlikely that it would have incited anyone to debauchery. Temperance advances from her niche in the direction of the viewer67 yet looks toward the rear of the chapel. With her head classi- 65 James Kincaid, Child-Loving (New York and London: Routledge, 1992) p. 4: "By insisting so loudly on the innocence, purity, and asexuality of the child, we have created a subversive echo: experience, corruption, eroticism." I'm not so sure the eighteenth- century insisted all that vehemently on the asexuality of the child; the term putto, which was rarely if ever used before the eighteenth century (according to the Vocabolario della Crusca), derives from puttanesco, and already suggests a being of some prurience. The word putto also is, in some dialects, such as the Venetian, close to other words used to describe a "ragazzo," a young boy. But innocence? Yes. The gentle child ("come carino il cherubino!" one still hears in rerference to these little putti in Roman churches)-the putto or cupid who derives from the Christian cherub and Roman genius-is a locus amoenus, a site of sexual interest. Here we have an intertext that cries out for critical attention. 66 Vocabulario della Crusca, vol. II, 2nd. ed., Florence, 1717: "putto. Add. Puttanesco, di puttana. L. Meretricus. Usato da Dant.

She entices, inveigles, and gently seduces us. The pacific air of unselfconscious beauty, matched by the crisp folds of drapery, exquisite sculptural handling of all surfaces, and the mild and easeful S-curve of the figure all work together to persuade the viewer of the values of temperance, in one's life and in one's art. Della Valle's style is shot through with the values of sophrosyne, which, if I may extend the metaphor, constitute some of the cultural values of the Roman settecento. Even in the rhetorical tradition of the fourth century B.C., temperance was associated with political import. As I mention above, Plato had canonized the four cardinal virtues in Book IV of the Republic. Helen North explains ". .. the sophron polites ('citizen') depicted by the fourth-century orators, is invariably a fervent democrat, a foe of both oligarchy and Sparta, a citizen who benefits the state by his inoffensive, law-abiding conduct and his generosity in the performance of 'liturgies'-outfitting warships, subsidizing religious processions, and the like."68 And the law-abiding citizen of the Roman eighteenth century would not overstep the boundaries of religious beliefs. Enlightenment ideas-intrusive, and dangerous from the point of view of the Church-were kept out of Rome as long as possible. The form of the allegorical representation "owes" much to Alessandro Algardi's figure of Liberality for the Tomb of Leo XI (completed 1644), St. Peter's (figure 6). Della Valle substitutes a flask for Liberality's cornucopia, and he also shows Temperance moving to her right, whereas Algardi's figure remains more or less static. Drapery patterns as they swing around the figures are quite similar, in spite of the fact that the handling of individual folds differs significantly. Another telling contrast between the two allegories is the diffident and self- conscious manner in which Temperance exposes her breast. I use the fairly standard art historical language of "owing," with the appropriate scare quotes, when referring to della Valle's use of Algardi's allegorical form. This notion of indebtedness, appropriation, and obligation of course suggests that the later artist is somehow liable and beholden to the earlier artist. That sort of language carries an implied denigration of the later artist. One of the interesting, and perhaps unset- tling, phenomena of eighteenth-century Roman sculpture is its lack of originality. Della Valle worked from sketches and directions of 68 Helen North, "Temperance (Sophrosyne), and the Canon of Cardinal Virtues," Dictionary of the History of Ideas, vol. 4. (New York: Scribner, 1973) p. 368. 36</page><page sequence="47">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE Alessandro Galilei, Ferdinando Fuga, and Pietro Bianchi. And many of his figures remind us of Rusconi, Algardi, and Francois Du Quesnoy (the Flemish sculptor's St. Susanna in Santa Maria di Loreto in Rome is also similar to Temperance). But rather than say that the art of this period is unoriginal, we can comment instead that it is replete with intertextual significance, in which an artist's work is inscribed with the marks and styles of other artists. With an intertextual approach, the critic looks for the nuances and subtleties of forms and images creating transactions with one another, where meanings and affects are created out of permutations, combinations, subversions, and neutralizations of one monument in confrontation with another. Stephen Heath, a literary critic who uses intertextuality, perceives a continual process of transformation at work among texts (for which read, works of art). "Far from being the unique creation of the author as originating source, every text is always (an)other text(s) that it remakes, comments, displaces, prolongs, reassumes."69 Heinrich Plett responds to this particular observation of Heath's by writ- ing, "Consequently, every text is always subjected to a process of repeti- tion. It exists as a perennial interplay between identity and difference. That constitutes its intertextuality."70 The very fact that one artist will appropriate likenesses from another alters the significance of forms and images and sets up a vital interchange that creates a tension between likeness and unlikeness, similarity and contrariety. Literary historians enjoy the inversion of the deja lu; art histori- ans can re-erect that inversion and write specifically about the deja vu. A more nearly contemporary text (a good word for art historians, because it suggests a weaving and therefore something visual as opposed to linguistic) is the Prudence by Agostino Coracchini, in another niche of the Corsini Chapel (figure 7). The Prudence displays some of della Valle's delicacy but little of his charm. Prudence holds a mirror and gazes at herself like a "sophisticated shepherdess," in Antonia Nava Cel- lini's terms.71 The smaller fingers of her left hand pop out in an affected expression of delicacy, a gesture Comacchini may have picked up from 69 Stephen Heath, The Nouveau Roman: A Study in the Practice of Writing (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1972) p. 24. 70 Heinrich Plett (ed.), Intertextuality (Berlin and New York: W. de Gruyter 1992) p. 17. 71 Antonia Nava Cellini, La scultura del settecento (Turin: Unione Tipografico-Editrice Torinese, 1982) p. 32. 37</page><page sequence="48">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Figure 7.

She stands upright, weight borne by her left foot fixed at the very center of gravity. Her ample right leg bends at the knee and sways a bit toward the other leg, as if she unconsciously assumes the position of a Venus pudica. Della Valle's Temperance, on the other hand, appears to be in action, moving to our left. She looks like she might start sprinkling the water over the ground as she walks. That subtle sense of movement, with drapery patterns almost encouraging her action (her left foot gives the impression of being ready to propel her into a pirouette around the fiasco di vino) makes of della Valle's Temperance something more dynamic and more interesting than Coracchini's Prudence. The putti at Prudence's feet appear at once flaccid and overly muscled, with heads that are too big. In contrast, della Valle's children display a remarkable delicacy. In the great niche in the right arm of the Chapel, Giovanni Battista Maini, della Valle's one-time housemate, presents an image of Cardinal Neri Corsini (figure 8) that displays some of della Valle's ele- gance and easefulness. Neri places his hand to his heart, crinkles his mozzetta between index and middle finger, and looks down as if in prayer or meditation. The rising pattern of drapery from lower right to upper left and the hip-shot sway achieve some of the lightness of bearing that one finds in della Valle. The long and tubular folds of drapery emphasize the deftness of Maini as he presents a full-sized figure of great physical weight and religious eminence-the cardinal nipote-posing for his own tomb. S I MENTION ABOVE, THE FLORENTINE ALESSANDRO Galilei has been critiqued as a neoclassicist in spirit. He adheres neither to the Borrominesque nor Beminesque tendencies in eighteenth-century architecture. Elizabeth Kieven summarizes Galilei's style: In the Corsini chapel, Galilei left contemporary Roman architecture behind him and moved further toward neoclassical forms than would be possible again in Rome for many decades. Contemporary comments are more enthusiastic about the richness of the decoration than about the design. Valesio found the chapel 'dry and boring.' The general reaction was more puzzlement than approval.72 72 Kieven as in note 53, p 258; Valesio's comment comes from his Diario di Roma, edited by G. Scano and G.

Buon gusto is not neoclassicism, but it is close to it. As a way to uncover and critique della Valle's stylistic tendencies, one can compare him with his equally-or perhaps more-famous contem- porary Pietro Bracci. Nava Cellini observes that these two sculptors define the middle years of the settecento in Rome with their strong artis- tic personalities. "Their versions and their interpretations are rather different: the former [della Valle] seems to follow a reserved and controlled path, the latter [Bracci] is more vigorous and vivacious."74 It is not an easy task to choose more or less "comparable" works for compari- son: these two artists favor such different manners of presentation that one can easily see them as sculptors in conscious opposition to one another. For instance, Pietro Bracci's image of Caritas, from the monu- ment to Maria Clementina Sobieski in Saint Peter's (figure 9) represents a seated female figure, as does della Valle's allegorical figure of Faith for the funerary monument of Thomas Dereham (plate 45). But they seem so different from one another! Bracci's Caritas holds the ardent fire of love in her outstretched hand: her gaze passes the bronze flame and continues into the beyond. The patterns of drapery on the figure of Caritas have something of the later baroque agitation to them, folds that set up a commotion and perturbation underlining the strain of zealous devotion. Allegorical representations in the baroque style have an itch to get outside themselves, to enact divine transport. Della Valle's Faith, on the other hand, seeks tranquillity, relaxation, self-absorption, almost as if this quietus were a stoic virtue. One can attribute these differences in style to the artistic personalities of Bracci and della Valle; one can further say that there were a limited number of stylistic choices open to sculptors in the eighteenth century-and here we find two of the more common modes of expression. But there is something unusual about della Valle's sense of a calm and contemplative Faith. She is not a neoclassical figure in Canova's sense; there is none of the "noble simplicity and quiet 73 Honour, op. cit., pp. 173-174: "Filippo della Valle has occasionally been claimed as a harbringer of the neo-classical style. Yet a close examination of his works demonstrates that he never departed from the late baroque tradition in which he was trained." 74 Nava Cellini, loc. cit.

WORK. AND STYLE grandeur" of Winckelmann. What remains is a representation of an alle- gorical figure that has no desire to enact a transcendent idea. Imitation requires energy and a goal-a telos. The composure of della Valle's figures suggests a dysteleology, an abdication of the mission of art to correspond to its idea. Cupid and Psyche: A Forged Signature and Child Loving An especially charming group from the 1730s is della Valle's Cupid and Psyche (plates 10 to 12). In 1732 he signed an engraving of the group and dedicated it to the owner of the original sculptural ensemble, the Florentine Francesco Maria Niccolo Gabburri. 75 At his death, della Valle bequeathed this group (or another like it) to his wife Silvia (". .. lascio alla Sig.ra Silvia mia amatissima Consorte scudi cento sopra il gruppo di marmo da me lavorato di due putti, che si baciano," see Document II). The group now resides in the Wallace Collection, London, but carries the signature, apparently a forgery, of "Cayot, 1706."76 I suspect that della Valle and his wife Elisabetta Silvia Pazziani, who was fourteen years his junior, held some affection for the kissing putti, for he had just finished them before their marriage on the 1st of November 1733.77 (Gabburri 75 Gabburi was a great friend of Florentine artists; he used his position as "Lieutenant" of the Florentine Academy of Design to patronize and to protect them. As early as 1722 he owned a drawing of a Bacchanal by della Valle (now lost). Giuseppe Campori, Raccolta di Cataloghi ed Inventarii Inediti (Modena: Tipografia di Carlo Vincenzi, 1870) p. 569.

Among the witnesses were the artist Antonio Derizet (from Lyon; he arrived in Rome as a pensioner of the French Academy and remained there until his death) and Francesco Gherini. According to the Stati d'Anime in the same parish (also in the Vicariato archives), Silvia Paziani in 1725 lived with her father, mother, and one of her seven brothers and sisters near Piazza Barberini. She was thirteen years old at the time. It is possible that della Valle's studio may have been incorporated in the Pazziani house- 43</page><page sequence="54">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY refers to Silvia [as della Valle called her] as "una onesta e civile Fanci- ulla." and states that they were married in 1734). No other work of art is mentioned in della Valle's will. This apparently was all of his profession that he retained near the end of his life and must indeed have been of great importance to him. The inscription of "Cayot 1707" has been accepted by a number of scholars as genuine and does indeed look remarkably like Cayot's sig- nature revealed after the cleaning of a Compagne de Diane at Cliveden (figures 10, 11, and 12).78 But there is circumstantial evidence that chal- lenges the reliability of the 'signature' and clears the way for a reattribu- tion of the group to Filippo della Valle.79 No single piece of the evidence adduced against Cayot's signa- ture is convincing on its own account: taken together, however, the various factors point away from the French artist. The strongest collabo- rative evidence in favor of Cayot is the Cliveden Compagnes de Diane with its signature; it is this very statue, however, that led me back to what I suspect to be a trick played on Sir Richard Wallace, or (more likely) his father, Richard Seymour-Conway, the fourth Marquess of Hertford. But first, it would be helpful to review Cayot's career and the commission of Diane's companions. Jean-Auguste Cayot was born in Paris in 1667, the son of a wood sculptor.80 Although he was first apprenticed as a painter with Jouvenet, he went on to study sculpture under Le Hongre. He gathered prizes at the French Academy in 1695 and 1696 but, contrary to early reports, appar- ently did not go to Rome as a pensionnaire at the French Academy. Although we know that Cayot was for more than a decade assistant and collaborator with Van Clieve, we do not know the exact nature of their association. He became an academician in Paris in 1711, after which he had commissions at Notre-Dame, Versailles, and elsewhere. His hold, given the proximity of the church of S. Nicola di Tolentino (according to Chracas, della Valle's studio was quite close to the church) to Piazza Barberini. 78 T.

The commissions began as early as 1696 and continued until 1722, with perhaps fifteen of the requested eighteen completed. Terrence Hodgkin- son has traced ten of these figures and has used the cleaning of the most recent discoveries (by Claude Poirier and Cayot) as the occasion for an article on the Compagnes. Cayot's Compagne, like the others in the series, was never placed in the Garden at Marly, but did show up in a 1723 inventory of sculpture in the Tuileries. Despite the fact that another inventory of the sculpture at the Tuileries gardens dating from 1776 still mentions the figure by Cayot, Mr. Hodgkinson believes that the later information is considerably out of date and that four of the Compagnes were removed to the Hotel du Grand Maitre at Versailles in 1724. The figures are difficult to trace until the early part of the twentieth century when, according to Mr. Hodgkinson, they were purchased from the Chateau de Bagatelle by the first Lord Astor for his country house at Cliveden. It is at Bagatelle in Paris that the Compagne's path crossed with that of Cupid and Psyche.81 Lord Hertford purchased Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne and lived there most of the time. We have no direct evidence of when Cayot's Compagne or the Cupid and Psyche may have come into Hertford's Collection. It is likely, however, that they arrived somewhere toward the middle of the nineteenth century. Although the third Marquess was an Italophile and apparently was taken with "marble mania," his quite complete records do not mention either of these works. It is more likely that the fourth Marquess purchased them; but, because he did not keep such comprehensive records, we are left to speculate about when they were purchased and under what conditions. Although it is known that Lord Hertford rarely bought from dealers and relied upon sales, there is no reason to believe that anyone hoping to sell him a work-whether or not it be through his agent-would be ignorant of his tastes. Also it seems likely that a few purchases at least were made directly through dealers. A nineteenth-century collector or dealer would have considered the Cupid and Psyche a piece of decorative art not likely to fetch a 81 For the history of the Wallace Collection and excellent biographies of the Marquesses of Hertford and Sir Richard Wallace, see the following publications of the Wallace Collection: The Hertford Mawson Letters: The 4th Marquess of Hertford to his agent Samuel Mawson, ed.

But as decorative art it belonged to an impor- tant part of the Marquess's collection: the Cupid and Psyche may have been shown with other of his objects at the Musee Retrospectif, an exhibition of decorative art at the Palais de l'Industrie, which opened in August 1865. Of the approximately 380 items lent by Lord Hertford, 249 were oriental armor, with the remainder mostly rococo furniture and decorative arts.82 It is not hard to imagine that the Cupid and Psyche would have been of some interest to the Marquess as a companion to his Beauvais tapestries of the Story of Psyche from designs by Boucher. An unscrupulous dealer had a statue by Cayot ready to hand with an authentic signature: he merely had to stroll through the Marquess' garden and surreptitiously make a sketch of the signature.83 Scratching in a more-or-less believable signature by Cayot (the "t" is weakly done, however) would be the work of less than an hour and, by making the work a product of the reign of Louis XIV, would significantly increase the value of a marble group of uncertain origin. And it would enormously enhance the possibilities of engaging the Marquess's interest. There is a certain cunning in the forger's choice of artist: Cayot was not famous; an attribution to him would raise few if any eyebrows. But Lord Hertford, even if he were no expert, knew Cayot's art. The evidence points strongly to Filippo della Valle's authorship of the Cupid and Psyche. Certainly he would not have dedicated a work to his friend Niccolo Gabburri, proudly proclaiming to be his what was not. Gabburri was not one to be deceived; he was a noted connoisseur, had extensive collections, and knew French art very well. He published a biography of Cayot in the same text as his biography of della Valle.84 Like Gabburri, Lord Hertford knew about French art, even something of Cayot. But he did not know enough to be an expert on that particular sculptor. He probably had never heard of Filippo della Valle. And what dealer would be unmoved by the fabulous sums spent by the Marquess on eighteenth-century French art (among contempo- raries, only the Rothschilds could compete in the market or the auction 82 Hughes, op. cit., pp. 33-34. 83 For photographs of the Chateau de Bagatelle before 1870 showing the position of Cayot's Diana, see "Chateau de Bagatelle, NE: 1508 [petit foli] Bagatelle avant 1870, Marville," Photo. 84 [1923-201; 1917-14] Mus6e Caravalet, Paris. 84 The text for Cayot's biography is the same as that published in Abecedario pittorico (Florence, 1731) p. 108. 48</page><page sequence="59">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE house)? The power of money, the francophile tastes of a wealthy collec- tor, the obvious rococo style of an unsigned pair of kissing children, an art dealer of dubious character, and an accessible, copyable signature were certainly, in combination, sufficiently persuasive for carrying out a small gesture of deceit. The signature, an artist's mark of paternity, need not in this case confuse us with regard to the proper lineal descent of these amorous children. The group of Cupid and Psyche is manifestly in della Valle's style. There are certain characteristics that identify della Valle's putti. Bodies are soft, sensuous, and fleshy. Hands in particular reflect this supple, almost boneless quality. The wrist, back of hand, and articulated, pliant fingers undulate like waves; characteristically, we find dimples at the base of the fingers and folds of fat above the wrist. Also distinctive of della Valle-again, autographic-is the treatment of hair. It appears brushed into gently twisting locks that sweep over the ear, usually leav- ing a loose strand to fall in front. Chins are flattened and sometimes dimpled, lips are full and bee-stung, and there is the typical way in which the eye socket reveals itself both through the rounded ridge of the brow and the slight indentation just below the eye. The typical drapery patterns, so coyly pulled up between the babies' thighs, are treated with that angular and crisp clarity that shows della Valle's Florentine training. Although not the first to conceive of Cupid and Psyche as children (the sculptor G. Piamontini carved such a pair, now in the Palazzo Pitti, in 1707), this is, just the same, an unusual presentation of the story as found in the Golden Ass by Lucius Apuleius (the myth itself, however, precedes Apuleius by at least half a millennium). The Roman writer told of a young woman and her lover Cupid, by whom she was impregnated. Although Apuleius describes both Cupid and Psyche as young, they were not the small children della Valle has given us. The eighteenth century may have been the time of the "cult of the child,"85 but one wonders what sort of religious persuasion, what cult, is being represented here. Matthew wrote (18:3) "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the king- dom of heaven." But children had traditionally been treated with a certain degree of scorn (in a famous passage, Montaigne forgets how many children he lost in infancy). As Philippe Aries has written, many ancien regime records, especially those from the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century, show that a child's sexuality was 85 See George Boas, The Cult of Childhood (London: Warburg Institute, University of London, 1966). 49</page><page sequence="60">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY neither ignored nor protected.86 Yet by the end of the seventeenth cen- tury, modesty and innocence became by-words in etiquette and instruc- tional manuals, as well as pastoral writings relating to confession. A text that many have thought a defining moment in enlighten- ment ideas, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Emile, calls for the educating and humanizing of children, for treating them as unique beings and childhood as a period of simplicity and self-discovery. And yet the sexualizing of children seems not to have abated much in this century. The very word "putto," with its derivation from puttana, reveals how the individual could sublimate his or her desires into little angels.87 Cherubino, an ado- lescent in Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, asks: "Voi, che sapete, che cosa e amore?" You who know, what is love? While it would be interesting to know if della Valle had read Apuleius's story of Amor and Psyche, establishing this is not altogether crucial to our critique of the piece. Simply by invoking the familiar tradition, this group calls to itself implications and readings of the older text and betrays something of the attitudes of della Valle, his class, and artistic idiom. Art historians debate and even struggle with the heteroge- neous paths connecting object and "pre-existing" text. Although no secure, nor even popular, avenue seems to exist for tracking dialogic and intertextual inter-illuminations, one can at least make some tentative associations and connections. Mieke Bal writes that Images are readings, and the rewritings to which they give rise, through their ideological choices, function in the same way as sermons: not a re-telling of the text but a use of it; not an illustration but, ultimately, a new text. The image does not replace a text; it is one. Working through the visual, iconographic, and literary tradi- tions that produced it, these images propose for the viewer's con- sideration a propositional content, an argument, an idea, inscribed in line and color, by means of representation. By means, also, of an appeal to the already established knowledge that enables recognition of the scene depicted. Paradoxically, this recognition is an 86 Philippe Aries, Centuries of Childhood, trans. R. Baldick (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962). 87 Vocabulario della Crusca, vol.

In other words, della Valle's sculpture is a text, just as is Apuleius's Amor and Psyche. At the same time, one can-following Bal-call upon the tradition of the written text and the ways in which it is to be understood. It is worth noting that about this time Cardinal Alessan- dro Albani gave to the Capitoline collections his famous ancient group of Cupid and Psyche, who are represented as a young but not a childish couple. The imagery had a certain popularity in Rome. The tale of Cupid and Psyche covers a lot of "psychic" ground. Psyche's beauty threatens Venus, who sends her son Cupid to strike into the lovely mortal an irresistible but disastrous lust for the "vilest of men, for one whom Fortune has condemned to have neither health, nor wealth, nor honor, one so broken that through all the world his misery has no peer."89 The irony, of course, is that Cupid himself falls in love with her, and while she seeks to discover his (and her own sexual) identity, she cuts herself on his sword. Their love, a mythic miscegenation, is finally, after disasters, violence, wanderings, and the performing of Herculean tasks, confirmed and sanctioned at a feast of the gods. There seems no hint in della Valle's group of the bloody tale; indeed, these oddly sexual as well as discreet children seem to be acting out an adult drama with little apparent awareness of its implications. Della Valle protects children and viewer by both sexualizing and asexualizing the figures. Psyche is a bit like apudica figure in that her pudendum is concealed. And although Cupid's nudity is not masked, he does not appear priapic. I hardly know what to say about this curious admixture of innocence and experience, except to comment that the visual culture of early eighteenth-century Rome may have had its secrets. In his History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault notes that since the early seventeenth century, all classes in European culture had invented newer discourses for articulating aspects of childhood sexuality.

In Foucault's discursive terms, then, Filippo della Valle's Cupid and Psyche is a visual text that both cloaks and reveals childhood sexu- ality by, in the first place, changing the earlier story from one told of adolescents to one depicting very young children; and, secondly, chasten- ing the visual representation by concealing or de-emphasizing the sexual organs naturally associated with and implied by the kiss and the erotic tale. Della Valle's image wants to have it both ways: small children can be mythologized so that they are simultaneously asexual and the most profound instances of sexual lore.9 Michael Levey (who insists on the traditional attribution of these figures to Claude-Augustin Cayot) comments on the "titillating" qualities of Cupid and Psyche. Its pervasive infantile grace is such that Psyche too has become a child-a very unusual motif-but the play between the two children is hardly innocent. This piece has an almost Alexandrian sophistication and provoca- tion ....

Although the group might well be directly inspired by the embracing winged children in the centre of Titian's Venus Worship, it speaks a less frankly sensual language and one more titillating. A very conscious concept of modesty placed that piece of drapery between the thighs of a girl who has hardly ceased to be a baby-concealing the sex of one barely possessing sex. These highly experienced children do not quite kiss but savour the moment of their lips' proximity without actually being in contact.

WORK. AND STYLE A Noble Portrait for a Persona Gratissima at the Court of the Old Pretender The later years of the decade of the 1730s seem to have been as prosper- ous for della Valle as the early ones: his commissions included the monument in Santi Apostoli to Maria Clementa Sobieski (1737; plates 33 and 34), the exhibition of a portrait at the Annunziata in Florence in 1737, the relief of Saint Teresa in Ecstasy for Santa Maria della Scala, 1738 (plates 35 to 38), the figures of Justice and Religion over the main portal of the Consulta (plates 38 to 41), 1739, and the monument to Sir Thomas Dereham (with architecture by Fuga) in the English church of Saint Thomas of Canterbury in Rome, 1739-41 (plates 38 to 41). Thomas Derehem played an interesting role in the history of the ancien regime and in the life of the Old Pretender, James III. Dereham, of Norfolk, had spent a great deal of time in Italy, first at the Florentine court of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, then in Rome during the pontificate of Clement XII. He was said to have had influence with Clement and the Corsini family92 and was, in addition, a strong and valued supporter of James Edward Francis Stuart, in exile. From the reports of Baron Philip von Stosch of Kustrin, antiquar- ian and notorious spy, we know something about Dereham's early years in Florence and subsequent career in Rome.93 Once Dereham discovered that Stosch was spying for the British Foreign Office, "he began to persecute me [Stosch] like a fanatic, and did so till his death."94 Upon Clement XII's ascendance to the papacy, Stosch found the political atmosphere in Rome too dangerous (there is even a story that his life was threatened), and left for the relative safety of Florence, where, with assis- tance from his contacts in Rome, he continued his spying on the Stuarts at the Palazzo Muti. Derehem was important to Clement XII, keeping 92 Dereham was the Medici's representative in London during the negotiations for the Quadruple Alliance.

Because Clement remained convinced that the Stuarts would soon be restored to power, he continued to support James III. One of Dereham's tasks while serving both the papal and Pretender's courts was to encourage the English residents in Rome to attend festivities sponsored by James. His lack of success in such activi- ties prompted the pope to attempt to banish all the English from Rome who were not supporters of the exiled King. The wise counsel of Neri Corsini stopped this intemperate gesture by Clement XII, which may indeed have been instigated by Dereham. Stosch reports in the mid-1730s that "Dereham's authority is ever on the increase and ... he has made the pope and the Romans believe that English affairs have found support in his behalf from persons of great importance. He boasts to those who know no better, of the great credit he enjoys in the Court of St. James's, and owing to which he is made Protector of the British Nation. The visitors who come to Rome, easily allow themselves to be dazzled by his expensive dinners and equipages."95 Dereham's influence was not suffi- cient, apparently, to gain admission to the order of the Freemasons; indeed, Baron Stosch's zealous support of the Freemasons probably negated whatever power Dereham possessed-at least in this regard.96 Perhaps as a response to his rejection, Dereham encouraged Clement to issue a Bull denouncing this organization and requiring its members, under pain of heavy fines and imprisonment, to reveal its secrets. In the winter of 1739 Dereham grew ill and received Extreme Unction from the pope. Stosch reports that on February 9 "the Cardinal Nephew went to visit Sir Thomas; nor will he be sorry at the death of this inconvenient 'Controller' of his actions, though externally, to please his Uncle, he treated him as his dearest friend." Sir Thomas died February 7, 1739. According to an anonymous biography, Clement's own sincerity and innocence kept him from detecting the manipulation of others. Perhaps Dereham was one of those who had the art to play upon Clement's trusting nature.97 Whatever his means and methods, Thomas 95 Ibid., p. 16. 96 Karl Justi, Winckelmann und seine Zeitgenossen (Leipzig: 1898), Vol. II, p. 218. 97 MS., Biblioteca Corsiniana, Rome, Cors. 1385, p.

WORK, AND STYLE Dereham was a man of some political clout in the 1730s, and undoubt- edly wanted an appropriate tomb to reflect his position and worth in his adopted Italy (there remains a small monument sent by him to the West Dereham Church in Norfolk, UK). The translation of his epitaph tells something of his exiled status: "Thomas Dereham of Dereham, Baronet of Great Britain, For the love of the true Religion, A fugitive from his Country to Catholics, The last of his family, Abstained from marriage Lest Loyalty to God and to his lawful king, So faithfully maintained by himself, Should be endangered by his posterity. This constancy of his devotion He willed should be attested by this sepulcral [sic] slab. He died 7 February, in the year of our Saviour, 1739. He lived 59 years, 10 months, and 11 days."98 Della Valle, as a favorite of the Corsinis, probably knew Dereham and, although having little experience of British noble portraits, seems to have tried here to capture some appearance of an English milord. Della Valle is never more exaggerated or baroque in his handling of surfaces than he is with the relief portrait of Dereham.99 The proud gaze, strongly jutting chin, deeply drilled peruke, bunched drapery patterns and a nimbus-like pattern of striations surrounding his head create an impressive image. We do not know enough about Dereham to hypothesize too broadly (or too narrowly, for that matter) about his character. However, from what records survive (letters in the Foreign State Papers in London's Public Record Office), we can surmise some things about his role as a persona gratissima in the Jacobite Court of Rome and (what appears to be, at least from the reports of Baron Stosch) his ability to finesse and finagle, to win the confidence of the pope-if not of the papal nephew-and to make a career out of being a fugitive and of champi- oning the king in exile. One example of Dereham's influence concerns a certain Charles Fane who, as Minister of His Majesty, King George II, was a royal spy. In hopes, perhaps, that the Corsini would not know his role as a secret agent of George, he attempted to gain protection from the papal family. He found, however, that Pope Clement's reassurances were not sufficiently explicit or supportive. In a long letter reporting on his findings in Rome, Fane remarked that Sir Thomas Dereham represented 98 Translated by Father Goldie, as in note 94. 99 As we know from contemporary guide books, Ferdinando Fuga provided the design of the monument.

Neither the Empire nor the French were of much use in this matter. Dereham also let it slip that he maintained a large correspondence in England, which, through the offices of the French Ambassador to the Holy See, he communicated to the Pretender. These self-portrayals and clandestine activities suggest a highly developed craftiness. In that he chose his own epitaph, his Florentine sculptor and architect, and secured an important place (apparently near the altar-the tomb was moved after the Napoleonic plunder of San Tommaso di Canterbury) demonstrates Dereham's powerful and exceptional position in the Rome of the 1730s and his ability to negotiate, in the distinctive terms of settecento artistic presentation, his cultural, aesthetic, and reli- gious identity-post mortem. As studies of fashioning and self-fashion- ing have demonstrated, one's identity in social and religious terms is largely determined by outside forces.?00 At the same time, Dereham had some personal role to play, some solitary and tortuous path to navigate, in his self-positioning among the numerous social and religious constraints and agencies at work in his circle, and in his ability to immor- talize his identity with a portrait in effigy on a tomb populated by allegor- ical figures. In judging the appearance of Sir Thomas Dereham in this particular setting, we have to concede a collaboration among Dereham, della Valle, and-to a lesser extent-Fuga. Out of this heady brew (or heterogeneous mix) comes a finely wrought and ostentatious portrait. Whether we know the man-or can decide upon which man we seek-is doubtful; but reading the portrait, with its somewhat saddened and at the same time casual allegorical character witnesses-those humble figures that later were to make Francesco Milizia so uncomfortable-reveals a bit about attitudes and maneuverings in the 1730s. A secretive yet pompous agent postures for the public and for the Pretender.

Innocent, who with this Bull Romanum decet pontificem did more than anyone else to end the lavishness of the seicento, now was enshrined in Christendom's great patriarchal basilica in funereal splendor. This tomb erases, in a sense, the retreat from papal patronage marked by the end of the seventeenth century, and signals the early years of a prosperous papacy that was deeply committed to the arts and learning. Benedict XIV evinced his allegiance to the visual arts by completing projects begun under Clement XII and by adding important restorations and new facades to the many churches in the city of Rome.'10 With his purchases of ancient statues and recovery of work from Hadrian's villa in Tivoli, he furnished and opened the Capitoline Museum in 1743. He then bought the Sacchetti collection of paintings to launch the pinacoteca for the Palazzo dei Conservatori. Merenda, in his unpublished biography of Benedict, referred to him as "di genio natural- mente fabricatore" (of a natural talent for building).'02 His directions to all those, bishops and others, of episcopal responsibility and authority, that they visit Rome at least once in every three-year period secured even further, if such were necessary, the importance of Rome as a cosmopoli- tan, episcopal, and pastoral center.'03 Many church scholars regard Benedict as the most capable and energetic of eighteenth-century popes, one who did much to organize the church, reestablish the influence and legitimacy of canon law, support scholarship and the new sciences of the eighteenth century, and to appear to all as a man of great integrity, religious scruple, wit, and learning. Prospero Lambertini, near the end of the conclave that elected him, said "If you want a saint, take Cotti; if you want a statesman, take 101 Benedict restored the Colosseum, built the Casino or Kaffeehaus in the gardens of the Quirinal, brought water into the Fontana di Trevi (although the final disposition of the statues was not to be realized until the 1760s), and, out of his personal income, erected the monument to the tragic Maria Clementina Sobieski in St. Peter's (only the third funerary monument to a woman erected in St. Peter's-Queen Christina and Mathilda of Tusany are the others). The pope replaced many of the paintings in St. Peter's with mosaics, restored and modernized (with a new facade) Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and engaged Ferdinando Fuga to erect the expensive new altar for Sant'Apollinare. 102 M.

Honest certainly; but equally indisputably, he was wise. 1750-A Jubilee Year As a direct contribution to the arts in Rome, Benedict XIV reinstituted the giving of prizes through the Accademia di San Luca to young artists. The celebrations for the triumph of the arts on the Capitoline Hill in the Jubilee Year of 1750 were exceptional in their panoply and formality. Benedict had spent fabulous sums during the decade of the 40s beautify- ing Rome for this Jubilee. He directed titular cardinals to do the same for their churches in Rome, fully expecting to greet Roman Catholic pilgrims with a Rome of renewed grandeur. For the celebration of the prize-giving to young artists in the Accademia, he invited the Old Pretender to the English Throne (James III), the local nobility, ecclesiastical notables, the members of the Roman academy, and his fellow countryman (that is, a Bolognese) Francesco Maria Zanotti, who was to deliver the expected oration in praise of the arts. The music was by Nicola Iommella, the musical director at St. Peter's. On a stage set up in the Gran Sala of the Museo Capitolino sat the cardinals and other dignitaries, and above them were the young prize winners. There were two tables, one for officers and the Principe, the other for the prizes as well as the Secretary and Undersecretary. The academicians were arrayed in benches flanking the Cathedra, which was raised to preeminence. From the Cathedra, Zanotti delivered his orazione. "If there were one among you, noble listeners, who marveled that I, a stranger of little value, allowed myself to be the first in this august assembly who rose to his feet and discoursed, know in the first place that I myself, before anyone else, marveled." This prologue serves the purpose of the captatio benevolentiae, the common rhetorical practice of affecting modesty so as to ensure the good will of one's listeners. He developed his exordium in the same tone, loosening up and puffing up his audience as he went along: "How can I compose an adequately ample and adorned oration, distinguish it with great knowledge, and give it variety, such that it were worthy of the Capitoline and of Roman ears?" Here Zanotti recalls the famous oration given by Petrarch when he was awarded the poet's crown by the Roman senator in April, 1341, on this same spot. Then he raises his central issue: "I will . . . endeavor to explain to you simply those reasons why I have been always convinced that these arts of painting, of sculpture, and of architecture are of great value, and of much excellence, such that no other art, no other science, 58</page><page sequence="69">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE no other discipline, no other faculty can supersede them, for they super- sede the many."'04 Zanotti argues not only for the preeminence of the arts, but makes a strong pitch for aesthetic disinterestedness (against the growing importance of utilitarianism in philosophy) and for a kind of I'art pour l'art. Zanotti's celebration of the aesthetic realm probably did not sit well with those who wanted to keep Rome comfortably ensconced in the ancien regime and the counter-enlightenment. Except for the artists. Della Valle, now in his early 50s (and soon to be elected Principe of the Accademia di San Luca), would have heard Zanotti's speech on the Capitoline Hill that spring day. However much Zanotti, one of Italy's most recognized scientific minds, may have undermined many of the conservative attitudes prominent in mid-eighteenth-century Rome, his commemoration of the belle arti and his advancement of a "modernist" view of the arts must have interested della Valle and sanc- tioned for him his own delicate style. Della Valle's fully mature manner of exquisite craftsmanship and preference for precise detail calls atten- tion to itself as stylishness and refinement. In his oration Zanotti apostro- phizes and summons an art that represents art: "O painting, O sculpture, ornament of the world, light and decorum of every noble studio, as a rare gift of Heaven, born among us to realize the beauty of the universe! You with your faithful companion architecture, imitating and making beauti- ful things, are yourselves even more beautiful than what you make. 0, if only one of your excellent artisans could paint you perfectly, and sculpt you, and represent you! How many passions would your images excite in the souls of men and how many flames would they ignite in the hearts of those who love you?"'?5 Their supremacy is such that as aesthetic 104 For Zanotti's orations see E.

Third quotation: "...m'ingegner6 di spiegarvi semplicemente quelle ragioni per le quali io sono stato sempre persuasissimo, che queste arti della pittura, della scultura, e dell'architettura siano di tanto pregio, e di tanta eccellenza, che niuna altra arte, niuna scienza, niuna disciplina, facolta niuna debba loro anteporsi, essendo esse da anteporsi a moltissime." 105 "O pittura, o scultura, ornamento del mondo, lume e decoro d'ogni nobile studio, per raro dono del cielo tra noi nate a compiere la bellezza dell'universo! Voi con la vostra 59</page><page sequence="70">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY gestures painting and sculpture supersede that which they imitate, reify art, and in so doing lead to the fealty of amanti (amateurs). Zanotti seems to be suggesting that the work of art represents (reflects, expresses, mir- rors) at the same time that it produces (articulates itself). The language of art therefore becomes more insistently visual than it had been in the Renaissance or baroque periods. Della Valle's conscious attitude toward a theology of art or "art for art's sake" in the eighteenth century must remain a mystery of course. His intention and beliefs about the power of art are not recorded. All we have to judge is his work and its context. But we do have Zanotti's oration. Insofar as he enunciates aesthetic attitudes and values for settecento Rome, we can infer from Zanotti's pronounce- ments an authorization for an art of dissimulation, an art that purports to imitate but which in fact draws us to the necessary beauty of its own gesture. Della Valle's art, in all of its passive tranquillity, does little to commemorate the church; in its own stylishness, della Valle's sculpture fails to promote an ideology of transcendent political importance. Its at- tractiveness, its dissimulation and pretense as a style that can carry for- ward like a telephone wire a proposition about heroism, presence, and authority (when in fact it does not do that) makes della Valle an unex- pectedly pertinent sculptor for an age and a papal court whose functions have slipped a bit into empty ritual.106 The modem category of art was, even as Zanotti orated, undergoing refinement and self-definition. As Paul 0. Kristeller has stated, it was the amateur or amante who helped to articulate the bonding of the three visual arts-painting, sculpture, and architecture-as siblings. The philosophers and aestheticians were to de- velop the category further. But at the beginning, as Kristeller writes, "The basic questions and conceptions underlying modem aesthetics ... had their inconspicuous beginning in secondary authors, now almost for- gotten though influential in their own time....."'07 fedel compagna architettura, imitando le cose belle, le fate, e siete voi stesse ancora pii belle di quelle, che fate. Oh se alcuno de' vostri eccellenti artefici potesse dipingervi perfettamente, e scolpirvi, e mostrarvi quai siete agli occhi degli uomini, e vivamente rappresentarvi! Quanti amori ecciterebbono negli animi umani le vostre immagini, e quante fiamme si accenderebbon nei cuori de' vostri amanti!" 106 At the risk of repeating myself, let me hear again state that few, if any, historians have suggested that the Church was bankrupt, that Rome and its institutions were meaningless. But there is very nearly universal agreement that Rome's status as a political and spiritual center had changed and indeed had diminished by the eighteenth century. 107 Paul O.

The first of della Valle's commissions in this Jubilee Year and for the decade of the 50s was for the monumental relief of the Annunciation for the altar of the left transept in the Jesuit church of Sant'Ignazio. Let me quote at length a description found in Chracas' Diario ordinario, a curious but highly informative weekly news digest of the events in eighteenth-century Rome (with short reports from other cities as well). The quotation demonstrates, even to the rather unusual (for Chracas) length and complexity of sentence structure, the sense of stately celebration attending the dedication of a major work of art at the induc- tion of Jesuit novitiates. The entry is dated 28 February 1750. Having been nobly and richly decorated even unto the great crossing in the midst of the Church of Sant'Ignazio by damasks and crimson velvet trimmed with lace of gold, and of six famous tapestries placed at the entrance of the six lateral chapels, so that all was displayed with the greatest propriety and magnificence in order to sustain a public disputation dedicated to Our Father on behalf of the School of the Sacred Rites, founded in the Collegio Romana for the benefit of those who prepare for the ecclesiastical life, these same [novitiates], gratified and honored, after luncheon on Tuesday, the day before the function, by the presence of the pope [Benedict XIV], now brought themselves to the church where they were received by the Provincial Fathers and the Rector of the College, with others of those fathers who were graduates of the Society of Jesus. One observed the Holy Father's great satisfaction, not only for the sumptuous decoration, which was complemented by a portrait of His Beneficence, placed beneath the rich dossal, with the pontifical arms erected above the great inner portal of the facade of the church, but also for the new and most noble Chapel of the Holy Annunciation, which had been unveiled with great effect, having just been brought to fine completion, within which was to be commended, among other things, the relief which forms the altarpiece, by the sculptor Sig. Filippo Valle.108 108 Chracas, Diario ordinario, #5088, 28 February 1750, 11 ff.: "Essendo stata nobil- mente, e riccamente apparata fino alla gran crociata nella navata di mezzo la Chiesa di S.

This appears to have pleased rather than to have shamed or scandalized the Romans. From all accounts, there was as much if not more of this public pomp than in the seventeenth century. Such a foreigner as the Frenchman Casimir Freschot, however, believed that sanctity was verily suffocated by manifestations of profane and public luxury, as demonstrated by the daily progressions and dedications of works of art (as described above in vivid detail by Chracas' Diario ordinario). Freschot wrote: "I1 y r6gne encore un abus, qui fait crier les protestants, et n'edifie pas les catholiques. C'est la celebration des fetes, avec un luxe si grand et si prophane d'ornaments d'Eglise, de musiques, de proces- sions, et d'autres spectacles propres A attirer les yeux, que toute la pi6t6 reste etouff6e dans la multitude, et la vari&amp;t6 de ces divertisse- mens, et de cette pompe"109 Freschot may have decried the pomp of the ceremonies attending the dedication of the altar, but he probably would have found less to argue with in the relief itself. Although one can undoubtedly perceive today-as one surely could have in the eighteenth century-richness of detail and pattern, della Valle's style of passive tranquillity does not exude luxury in the same manner as a style from the previous century would have. For all its scale and richness of material, the altar manifests some of the restraint and relaxation typical of the eighteenth century in Rome, but at the same time demands a near-sighted view that is, because one cannot easily get close, uncomfortable.

II, (Cologne, 1707) p. 85. 62</page><page sequence="73">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE The Greek manuscripts of the Lucan text never explicitly state that Mary saw (or heard) the archangel Gabriel at the moment of the Annunciation. Della Valle follows this tradition of Mary ignoring Gabriel by giving her the conventionally demure reaction, with downcast eyes, suggesting that the voice announcing the messiah ("Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.") is an interior one, gently moving Mary's tender soul. Her response "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" elicited the answer "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall over- shadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be bom of thee shall be called the Son of God." Della Valle shows numerous other angels, a fairly large Dove as vehicle for the Holy Ghost, and an image of God the Father who looks down on Mary, spreading his hands in a gesture of blessing and benevolence. Della Valle was careful to balance his representation of the Annunciation with Pierre Le Gros' St. Louis Gonzaga in Glory (figure 13) at the opposite end of the transept, completed more than half a century earlier. With each's emphasis upon three main figures, use of divine rays, and a supporting cast of numerous angels of varying size and maturity, the two sculptors created reliefs that have a similar large patterning, although della Valle's composition tends to run along parallel diagonals while Le Gros' is basically upright. In terms of details and drapery there are important differences. Sculptors reveal much of their peculiarities, personalities, and attitudes through their handling of drapery, those "frames" for individual figures, frames that call attention to themselves as bearers of style and meaning. In semiotic terms, drapery patterns are sites for inscribing meaning. Le Gros' figure of St. Louis Gonzaga is swathed in a long alb, or cloak, which creates a spiral pattern surrounding his body. The crests of the "linen" folds, which do not rise very far from the saint's body, follow breaking patterns like the ridges of a mountain range seen from the air. The edges of the marble, friable and delicate, sometimes fold back on themselves and zigzag on their journey from neck to feet. St. Louis Gonzaga is, after all, in Glory, and those "super-essential" winds (as Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite called them) that blow about in ethereal regions would indeed cause some of the irrational and nervous patters of Gonzaga's and the angels' garments. On the other hand, Le Gros' French sensibility moderates what amounts to a late seicento manner of expressing miraculous form. Le Gros calms the agitated waters of an earlier style. 63</page><page sequence="74">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY s-Au*tar) N.- Z 6. aMA -hIe-Cbiesa S. Ig nazo. S. L i gtoria8 bassarlievo at sua altare.

A comparison between the individual figures of the annunciatory angel (plate 65) and St. Louis Gonzaga divulges something else about the differences in style between the earlier Frenchman and the later Florentine. Le Gros worked in a style that can be aptly-if not highly descriptively-characterized as painterly and impressionistic. Gonzaga's hair melts into his scalp; the wavering folds of drapery descend under his right arm as if they were so many wishbone-shaped arterial systems just beneath the skin of the marble. The supposed end or purpose of this manner of sculptural handling is to create an optical presentation (as in the traditional dialogue between haptic and optic, one of those polarities developed in nineteenth-century Germanic art history) that reads well from a distance. Della Valle, on the contrary, reads well from up close. I would not say that he is haptic, in that there must be an incision or bulge for every apparent detail of the human body. His sculpture is not so much touchable as it is finely wrought, clearly delineated, precisely drawn, and articulate. Look at the basket made from coils of straw or twine (Plate 67). How could one really see that sort of detail from in front of the altar? Della Valle even chose to include a coffret whose lid clamps down on a stray piece of cloth (a reference to the gifts of the Magi?). As with the memorial to Innocent XII, one might be tempted to agree with Hugh Honour that here again there is small-scale detail that is "inappropriate" to the work's overall scale. But what is apropos and what is inconsonant about a manner of presentation? Must everything be given over to the needs and the power of the viewer? Does the viewer control the work of art? Insofar as there is a struggle between viewers and objects of sight- and certainly there is a growing literature in art history on just this point-della Valle withholds something from the beholder (unless, of course, the beholder is from a later age and has binoculars and a camera with a powerful telephoto lens). I do not get the sense from looking at della Valle's sculpture that he was contemptuous of the viewer; he just did not seem to feel the need to concede a great deal. His sculpture retains a level of detail that is not visible under normal circumstances. Like Phidias' horsemen from the frieze of the Parthenon, which-because of their skied position within the peripteron-also would have been barely visible, Filippo della Valle creates a kind of absolute sculpture whose existence precedes its visibil- ity, one that undoubtedly pleased him as he made it, and can please us when we have access to it. The gaze, which according to much recent critical writing is in the Western tradition primarily "male," has little of 65</page><page sequence="76">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY its power of procurement here. Without the assistance of some sort of lens, the gaze, of either gender, does not get at what can be seen. If the desire to see (scopophilia) is connected to the desire to know (epistemophilia), then della Valle confounds us somewhat in both of our urges. Because he does not concede to a fairly common judgment that one should keep detail consistent with lines of sight and conditions of visibility, he creates paradox and indeterminacy. In his peculiar way, della Valle creates an aporia, a visual phenomenon that frustrates its own visibility. In a subtle but evident way, at a certain level he stymies both seeing and knowing. Certainly a Roman Catholic viewer recognizes the Annunciation; further, the narrative event is viewed from within the composition by many cherubim, angels, archangels, God, and the Holy Spirit. Yet that oft remarked inappropriateness of scale disrupts our field of vision or produces some static-a visual and aesthetic white noise. This is typical of della Valle and arises from a social, cultural, ideologi- cal, and aesthetic circumstance that does not promote iconographical succinctness nor overarching messages about dominance. I began with a description of ritual, ceremony, and opulence, and ended this discussion of the Annunciation with reference to della Valle's "nearsightedness." His myopic mode of presentation-and I certainly do not suggest something pejorative from this characterization-does miti- gate and deflate the aggression implied by opulence. "Come closer," his style seems to say, "Don't let the ritual, the pomp, the ornament, or the festivities intimidate you, push you back, or (in Freschot's terms) suffo- cate you." Understatement can promote the pleasure of studying small details whose very inaccessibility may suggest that della Valle's style is passive-aggressive in its tranquillity. An Instance of Benedict's Displeasure with the Arts As I indicate above in connection with Zanotti's oration, Benedict XIV assigned a great deal of money for the refurbishing of Rome in anticipa- tion of the Holy Year of 1750. One instance of an expensive project that may not have met the pope's expectations was for the renovation of Santa Maria Maggiore. Della Valle made significant contributions to this campaign by designing and sculpting the statues of the Blessed Nicola Albergati (on the facade), the Holy Spirit relief on the Loggia della Benedizione, and a series of heads of putti (on the keystones of the lower story arcade, the pedestal of the Madonna, above the lateral doors to the nave, and on the capitals supporting the vault of the Loggia della 66</page><page sequence="77">LIFE. WORK. AND STYLE Benedizione-all in stucco-plates 47 to 50). And then toward the end of the decade, della Valle erected two candelabra-bearing angels for the area of the confessio (plates 68 and 69). These youths stand where the marble railings that project form the altar intersect with the balustrades circumscribing the area of the confessio. The rails then branch out behind to enclose the hallowed space of the high altar. The architect (Fuga) probably saw these figures as marking the boundary between the congregation and the basilica's sacred precincts. But as guardian figures, they welcome the faithful rather than, as in the opposite, apotropaic tradition, exorcise demons. Friendlier, more open expressions cannot be imagined. They provide small terminal accents a short distance from the large porphyry columns of Fuga's baldacchino. As decoration, Fuga probably wanted them to disperse somewhat the effect of heavy gilding on the urs supporting the altar, on the bases of the baldacchino-which carry Benedict's coat-of-arms-and on the helical arrangement of palm leaves stretching up the baldacchino's columns. The sensation of bright gold, symbolizing the perfect reful- gence of spiritual light, would terminate too abruptly if the eye did not travel to the putti with their gilding and the material, 'inferior' light of the torches: the transition from the spiritual to the material is thus drawn out. Fuga probably also wanted to break up the foursquare arrangement of baldacchino, altar table, and balustrades. The acolytes, by virtue of their physical attitudes and glances, establish a line of sight approxi- mately 45? out from the side of the baldacchino. But their scale, some- thing one might expect an architect to consider, is surprisingly irrelevant to the setting, especially when one recalls Pietro Bracci's enormous angels that once hovered above the four columns. Despite the more than 300,000 scudi that Benedict spent on ren- ovating and adorning Santa Maria Maggiore, he seems not to have been pleased by the results, especially as regards the interior. Benedict report- edly said to Fuga: "We haven't much to glory in here; someone might even take us for theatrical impresari. This has all the appearance of a ballroom."110 With that, we can imagine, he turned and withdrew in high dudgeon. Although there may be some question as to the authenticity of 10 L. A. Caraccioli's biography of Benedict, La vie dui Pape Benoit XIV, Prospero Lambertini (Paris, 1783) pp. 101-102: "Ne nous vantons pas d'avoir fait cet ouvrage, on nous prendroit pour des Entrepreneurs d'opera: elle a reellement l'air d'une salle de bal." This remark does not appear in earlier editions of Caraccioli's biography, which are considerably shorter. It may have been submitted at this date later in the eighteenth century as a censorious remark reflecting the tastes of the next generation. 67</page><page sequence="78">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY this statement, it does suggest a degree of consciousness of the theatrical and therefore "inauthentic" nature of ornament and decoration in the mid-settecento. Styles have their critics, and that of della Valle's age is no exception. One can but speculate that Benedict saw the way in which the art of his period may have failed in terms of decorum and taste. As the Jesuit motto states: "for the greater glory of God and the Church." As Benedict remarked: "We haven't much to glory in here." The Tomb for Innocent XII in St. Peter's Della Valle reached the apex of his Roman career even before the Anno Santo of 1750. With the unveiling of his monument to Innocent XII (plates 56 &amp; 57) in 1746, della Valle joined the ranks of the leading sculptors of the Roman tradition, for no other commission commands a more authoritative gesture: the supreme pontiff is memorialized within the confines of Christendom's greatest basilica. Della Valle received this commission from Cardinal Vincenzo Petra, Innocent's nephew. Petra engaged Ferdinando Fuga to build a wooden model of the tomb, which della Valle then followed."' Throughout much of della Valle's productive life, he sculpted and designed figures and their settings for that ceremonious object that succeeds death: the tomb. His sense of death and its aesthetic interpreta- tion reflects the values of a tradition whose current manifestation dated from the eleventh century, but which was now in the mid-eighteenth century drawing its own story to a close.12 His work conforms to an artistic institution that already was at least seven hundred years old and which had recollections extending into antiquity and beyond. His fune- real work is not mere recapitulation, however: it is something both simpler and more complex than what went before. Della Valle does not rely on the involved and strongly literary conceits used by Michelangelo in the Medici Tombs nor does he favor the equally complex, but more visual, conceits of Bernini. Like his contemporaries in Italian literature, he "demystifies" his art by abandoning the layers of iconographical interpretation and strained, sometimes explosive, visual form that domi- nated mannerist and baroque art. But the effect that results is neither one II See Document XXII.

We are not given an intellectually undemanding and therefore popularly accessible art. Filippo della Valle plays acutely upon the conventions and assumptions of funereal art. In a way, like the Counter-Reformation itself, della Valle reconstitutes and revives the ancient world-his art at first blush appears conservative, traditional, almost timeless; concurrently, della Valle undermines much of the classical tradition and presents us with a smoothly artful art, an art of such artifice that there no longer seems an impulse to greatness, imita- tion, or celebration of values beyond the aesthetic. While expatiating on funereal traditions in sculpture, he elevates art to a new, self-sufficient category. To say that there was an art to interpreting death is to say the obvious. But it is precisely this obviousness that makes the connection between art and death fascinating: that death needed art was taken for granted, assumed, and absorbed into the consciousness of patrons, artists, and public. This collectivization of an idea is particularly significant. As Philippe Aries has written about attitudes toward death, they are related to an "awareness of self and other, the sense of individual destiny or of the collective destiny of the race."13 One of the assumptions in the eigh- teenth century was that the tombs of the ecclesiastically and politically prominent were to be placed in a church. However, burial in churches is not a practice that the historian should assume to be perfectly natural. Interring the dead in necropolises outside the city walls was the original Christian tradition; indeed, John Chrysostum had admonished Christians to "take care that no sepulcher be built in town. What would you do if someone were to leave a corpse in the place where you eat and sleep? And yet you leave the dead not where you eat and sleep but next to the body of Christ.... How can one visit the churches of God, the holy temples, when they are filled with such a terrible odor?"114 There is then this tradition from antiquity, from non-Western cultures, and even from contemporary American and European cultures that the dead should be kept separate from the living, that they should not bother us, that familiarity with the dead is disturbing and unnerving, perhaps even dangerous. Although burial in churches was considered anathema by Saint John Chrysostom, the belief in resurrection and the worship of martyrs and their relics led to more accepting attitudes in the 113 Aries, ibid., p. xvi. 114 Saint John Chrysostom, Opera (Paris: Montfaucon, 1718-1738), Homily 74, 8:71, quoted in Aries, ibid., pp. 112, 30. 69</page><page sequence="80">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Roman Catholic Church from about the third century until the end of the eighteenth, when burial became less common within the church's sacred confines. In the earlier Tridentine years, St. Charles Borromeo affirmed the propriety of burying certain ecclesiastical dignitaries in the church. St. Peter's is the foremost church of Roman Catholicism, with its relics of the first pope and Bishop of Rome, St. Peter, and with its enor- mous inscription encircling the inner frieze of Michelangelo's great cupola: TU EST PETRUS ET SUPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM, ET PORTAE INFERI NON PRAEVALEBUNT ADVERSUS EAM. Anyone buried in St. Peter's is entombed ad sanctos, that is, near the relics of the great martyr. Maxiumus of Turin wrote "The martyrs protect us while we live in our bodies and take care of us after we have left our bodies. Here they keep us from falling into sin; there they protect us from the horrors of hell-infernal horror. That is why our ancestors took care to place our bodies near the bones of the martyrs. Tartarus fears them, and we escape punishment; Christ illuminates them, and his light drives away the shadows."115 There are certain functions of a papal tomb: to commemorate (which projects the identity and hence the fame of the deceased into the future), to memorialize (which recalls the subject's appearance and biog- raphy, the particulars of his life and identity), and to speed the soul to its salvation in the Heavenly Jerusalem (which is eschatological in nature). But "can" the putti surrounding della Valle's tomb transport Innocent's body at the Day of Judgment?116 An old anthem from the Roman funeral liturgy, In Paradisum, reads "May the angels take you to paradise, may the saints and martyrs come to meet you, welcome you, and lead you into the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem."117 I wonder about the responsi- bility, aptitude, and inclination of della Valle's angels to transport Innocent's soul. As Ludwig von Pastor reports in the History of the Popes, Innocent wanted an unpretentious urn.18 The pope cared little for "5 Aries, op. cit., pp. 112, 33. 116 See Document XXII. Della Valle had intended even more putti than are now present. Petra asked that two of the putti be changed into lions' heads, as one now sees on either side of the doorway below the monument. 117 Aries, idem. 118 L. von Pastor, History of the Popes, XXXIII (St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co., 1952) p. 670. 70</page><page sequence="81">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE commemoration or any biographical references. Innocent may have accepted the idea of a 'visible tomb' in the form of an ur, but his earthly and quasi-divine career as Christ's Vicar required no celebration other than a relatively simple marker for his earthly remains. A manuscript in the Vatican, dated 22 November 1692, describes what Innocent saw when he visited the place for his tomb in St. Peter's: "a beautiful ur of ischian stone with a tablet in the center, upon which is written in golden letters simply his name, without inscription, coat of arms, crown, or any other ornament."119 Such, it would appear, was sufficient for the severe, one-time inquisitor. Pignatelli left the salvation of his soul to the Day of Judgment. 120 There is irony in the fact that Innocent is well known as the pope who repudiated a major form of papal patronage-nepotism-and here is his nephew, Cardinal Vincenzo Petra, commissioning della Valle (apparently with the assistance of Benedict XIV, both in terms of money and of permission) to create something grander than a plain urn, some- thing in line with the more obvious and immediate examples of tombs by Guglielmo della Porta, Gianlorenzo Bernini, and Camillo Rusconi. Typical of this tradition is the placement of the pope on a throne and within an arcosolium (the word arcosolium comes from the Latin arcus for bow or arch and solium, seat or throne), flanked by personifi- cations of Charity and Justice, who comport themselves, in Erwin Panof- sky's terms, as "character witnesses."121 Della Valle's niche or arcosolium is shallower, narrower, flat at the back, and more slanting or beveled toward the front than Bernini's for the tombs of Alexander VII and Urban VIII, suggesting that the effect of framing is different, that there is an openness to della Valle's memorial, that the proud isolation, 119 Biblioteca Vaticana, MS. Ottob. 3362 120 The first descriptions of the tomb was in Chracas' Diario ordinario, #4560, 15 October 1746: "Si van proseguendo la gia cominciata erezzione oramai quasi terminata, del nobile Deposito della fan. mem. di Papa Innocenzo XII.

Then the earliest historical description of the monument is in G.P. Chattard, Nuova descrizione del Vaticano (Rome, 1763), I, pp. 46-47, in which he "corrects" the erroneous attribution to Ferdinando Fuga of the original design for the monument.

(see note 112) pp. 74-76. 71</page><page sequence="82">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY sense of grandeur, bearing, and megalopsychia of Alexander or Urban have been diminished, mitigated, deflated, but not made less rich and exquisite. Della Valle thematizes his frame by ornamenting it with fes- toons, lions' heads, and swags. The ornamentation, the beveling of the frame, the use of exquisite marbles, the small-scale drapery patterns, the delicately drilled lace work, intricacy of detail, that style so contemptu- ously dismissed by Goethe as one of"unmeaning smoothness"122 (and he was reacting specifically to settecento Roman art), very nearly achieves the reification of the visual arts that Francesco Maria Zanotti hailed in the stirring peroration to his oration in praise of the visual arts.123 Nina Mallory writes about the "dominance" of ornamental design in architec- tural frames in eighteenth-century Rome. The ornament, with its "softness, mobility, asymmetries, and grace," results in a principle of "organic unity and formal ambiguity."124 I interpret this notion of formal ambiguity to relate in part at least to the ambiguous notion of the frame. Kant's discussion of the parergon, or frame, has led Jacques Derrida to further, deconstructive considerations of how things frame. Here at della Valle's site in Saint Peter's is an instance of a deconstructive possibility: the frame does not separate inside from outside, the ergon from the par- ergon, the essential from the supplemental, the intrinsic from the extrin- sic. As Derrida appraises Kant's analytic of aesthetic judgment, it "forever assumes that one can distinguish rigorously between the intrin- sic and the extrinsic. Aesthetic judgment must properly bear upon intrin- sic beauty, not on finery and surrounds. Hence one must know-this is a fundamental presupposition presupposing what is fundamental-how to determine the intrinsic-what is framed-and know what one is exclud- ing as frame and outside-the-frame."125 Just as Derrida problematizes and deconstructs Kant's philosophy of the parergon, the design elements of eighteenth-century sculpture and architecture, especially in Rome, thematize the frame and make it more than an unmeaning zone that sepa- rates the meaningful or iconographical from that which is outside (the hors-d'oeuvre) or beyond significance. By undermining the detachment 122 Goethe, "Von deutscher Baukunst," Werke, XXXVII, p. 148; English ed.

No longer is the work of art the iso- lated container or origin of meaning. In his own "craving for origins" and at great expense (9,000 scudi), Petra celebrated his uncle, himself, and his family. In a fairly typ- ical eighteenth-century Roman textual mode, the inscription on the tomb celebrates elegance and ornament: INNOCENTII XII. P.M./ INORNA- TUM MONUMENTUM /IN HANC ELEGANTEM FORMAM REDIGI CURAVIT/ ADPROBANTE BENEDICTO XIV. PM.M/ VINCENTIUS S.R.E. CARD. PETRA EP : PRAEN./ ET. M : POENITEN./ A.S. MDCCXLVI. The very use of the word "monumentum" suggests Petra's desire to perpetuate the family's identity. Pignatelli, abstemious, simple, benefactor of the poor, opponent of nepotism, no longer had control over his own text. II nipote's desire for opulence stands in opposition to lo zio's "original" wish, which makes della Valle's funereal monument something akin to Harold Bloom's "misprision," a conscious and provocative misinterpretation of an earlier intention.127 And although Filippo della Valle's Monument to Innocent XII fits into a sequence of papal tombs, it dislocates the notion of succession. Of course, any poet or artist who is "influenced" by an earlier and very powerful source will misinterpret or create his or her own bias in refer- ence to the earlier work, so that it may on the outside appear to be simi- lar, but is in fact a creation of the younger artist and is therefore, to an extent at least, unique, or so Harold Bloom would maintain. Della Valle's tomb is really not very much like that of Bernini's Urban VIII. Certainly Urban's body language-especially his out-thrust arm-is assertive in a way that is alien to Innocent, who "moves" more hesitantly and gingerly. He is old. Della Valle cuts the marble into wrinkled and ruffled patterns; the relief is shallow and the drapery folds compressed. The pope is a melancholic image of an elderly, hunched figure seated uncomfortably on a throne. Della Valle's representation of Innocent functions as prosopo- poea, personification, or a certain kind of stony metaphor: he "makes" 126 Christopher Norris, Deconstruction Theory and Practice, rev. ed.

At the same time, della Valle does much to undermine this identification, to use style to infect and upset the normal process of imitation, and promulgation of certain meanings. Style always calls attention to itself, no matter how sublimated it may be, no matter how transparent the artist seems to make it, no matter how "realistic" the representation. Just the same, at a certain point style can take over, go beyond its mediating of the transaction between subject and object, and become the object. The viewer can lose sight of the identity, presence, or authority of the "subject"that (apparently) undergirds the work of art. This seems to happen when the style engulfs the content, when the style of a work no longer serves its master, the text, but reifies itself and commands attention for its own sake. Such a phenomenon occurs often enough in modernism. Indeed, there is in most art a struggle for power between identity and presentation. We like to know what we are looking at. If we have serious doubts about Innocent's authority vs. della Valle's style and intimacy (Hugh Honour wrote about della Valle that "some of his large figures have a delicate charm which may be thought inappro- priate to their scale"128), there will be a debacle, a breaking up, and a rush of uncertainty about the meaning. That the imitated should preside over the imitation (and imitator) is not, according to Derrida in Limited, Inc., "just one metaphysical gesture among others; it is the metaphysical exigency, the most constant, profound, and potent procedure."129 It strikes me that Berini serves his pope, while della Valle does not. Bemini's style assists commemoration and perpetuation of identity. Della Valle's style, either through a (pre-) moderist assertion of artful- ness, or through an inability to believe any longer in the mimetic model-in other words, through triumph or through "failure"-does not pay homage to Innocent, at least in the traditionally heroic terms of Rusconi's image of Gregory XIII or Bemini's of Urban VIII, or validate the Church's ideology with the same assurance as do earlier papal tombs.130 I am not trying to argue, in Walter Benjamin's terms, that della 128 Hugh Honour, "Filippo della Valle," Connoisseur, CXLIV, 1959, p. 174. 129 Jacques Derrida, Limited, Inc.

In that article, I was attempting a kind of "soft" decon- struction of della Valle's sculpture, especially this tomb of Innocent XII. For an observa- 75</page><page sequence="86">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Valle's monument to Innocent has lost all cult value and is really fit only for exhibition. The tomb remains fixed in place within a hallowed precinct. Just the same, a tension exists between how della Valle repre- sents a seated pope and what that image can mean within the traditional limits of interpretation and within the confines of St. Peter's. The patriarchal position of the papacy and, metonymously, the Church itself, have been challenged by della Valle's style and presenta- tion of Innocent. Insofar as aggression, assertion, visual drama, and a relatively clear, straightforward exposition of a recognizable image as head of a powerful organization assert masculinity, della Valle has done much to undercut all that, to question the gender of the papacy and those values and virtues associated with maleness. The whole matter of imita- tion lies in question. Style steals a march on mimesis. We question appropriateness of scale and fascination with detail. Innocent looks crumpled and repressed. His right hand opens in the gesture of ad locutio but simultaneously rises, falls backward, almost as if it were giving way to some counterforce. Compare della Valle's Innocent with Camillo Rusconi's Gregory (figure 14). I do not suggest that della Valle is making some sort of statement here about the circumstances of the church in the eighteenth century. I hardly believe that he would be so conscious or so polemical. Yet the very choices he made (or had made for him, in terms of the odd place- ment of the tomb above the door without clear lines of sight-the only papal tomb so placed in St. Peter's) about style, ornamentation, drapery (which is a serious issue for sculptors, one that is steeped in both convention and theory), how he handled his chisel, and how he fussed over minutiae all bear upon interpretations of such matters as the pres- ence of the pope and the status of what he represents within St. Peter's. Della Valle's style, like that of other artists, is freighted with ideology that in this case leads to a rhetorical assertion within the context of Tridentine Rome. And the assertion is one of indeterminacy, hesitancy, quietness, and lack of resolve. tion on the change from a "hieratic" papal image to a "conversation piece," see Hanns Gross, Rome in the Age of Enlightenment: The post-Tridentine syndrome and the ancien regime. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990) pp. 360-361, writes of Filippo della Valle and Pietro Bracci as sculptors who "sacrificed the grandeurs and sprightliness of the high baroque to a demand for charm, restraint, and elegance, and they carried on Camillo Rusconi's work of converting the papal tomb from a hieratic image of the vicar of Christ attended by allegories to an intimate conversation piece between the pope and two Roman ladies purporting to be the Virtues." 76</page><page sequence="87">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE Founders In the 1740s and 1750s, Benedict XIV supervised the installation of monumental statues of founders of religious orders in St. Peter's. In addition to della Valle's statues of Saint John of God and Saint Teresa, there are Saint Bruno (Michelangelo Slodtz, 1744), St. Vincent de Paul (Pietro Bracci, 1755), Saint Joseph Calasanctius (Innocenzo Spinazzi, 1755), and Saint Girolamo Miani (Pietro Bracci, 1756). One of the successes during the Tridentine period was the reform of existing orders and the founding of new ones. Saint John of God was an exemplar of the new saint whose "activism in grace" promoted the twin reformatory merits of piety and charity. Saint John of God (1495-1550) was of that generation of saints who lived in the sixteenth century and, as a product of Counter- Reformation (Tridentine) zeal, were canonized in the seventeenth (the bull for John of God was issued by Innocent XII in 1691) and eventually enshrined in St. Peter's. Although John Ciudad's intense religiosity landed him, for a time, in a lunatic asylum in Granada, he eventually founded the Brothers Hospitallers and spent his life caring for the ill and forsaken.'31 The religious community of St. John's Hospitellers, known in Italy as the Fattebenefratelli ("do well, brethren"-one of John's more famous exhortations), established itself in Rome in the eighteenth century and survives today on the Isola Tiberina. Della Valle's St. John of God (plate 55) supports a dying man, who folds in upon himself as if the air has just been let out. Wearing a crown of thorns as index and badge of affliction, John looks away with that expression that transcends style and history: Why must there be suffering? How can any one person bear so much pain, loss, death? Emile Male writes that John of God was "the saint of the abandoned sick, of the hopelessly ill. Charity in him had reached a heroic degree surpassing human limitations... ." And of this statue by della Valle, Male observes that the "saint's eyes seem to look into the distance with an anguished glance, as though he were wondering if his heart were vast enough to take unto itself all the suffering he sees in the world. The art of Italy here equals that of Spain in intensity of feeling."'32 In the Aristotelian notion of empathy, catharsis and identification arise from 131 N. McMahan, St.John of God (Dublin: M.H. Gill, 1953). The title "John of God" came from the association of Charity with God's name, for God is charity.

Typical of settecento aesthetics and dramatic narrative, our empathic reaction with della Valle's statue involves a shared sadness and loss, rather than awe-struck joy as with, for instance, Berini's Saint Longinus (figure 15). Aristotle understood that those sensitive souls who experience pity and fear share a catharsis, a pleasurable experience. The catharsis is not just edifying, but is purging and purifying, almost medicinal: Both the body and soul are relieved and somehow cleansed and gladdened. It seems to me that in both della Valle's St. John of God and Bernini's St. Longinus the process of catharsis operates between object and viewer. And yet there is something more grandly heroic about St. Longinus: That irradiation of Longinus's soul by the pure presence of God in His Son moves us in a somewhat less common way than our witnessing of St. John of God preparing to close a dead man in his shroud. Because John of God "founded" (the rule for the order was established after his death) the Hospitallers of the Fatebenefratelli, the beholder can infer succoring and therefore cleansing from this statue. S A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING DELLA VALLE'S SCULP- tural rhetoric, we can turn to some of the better known of the classic categories of styles. For instance, Hermogenes, a second-century Greek, had a system of rhetoric that identified several elements of oratorical expression. Two categories that seem especially telling in a comparison between della Valle and Bernini are grandeur (megethos) and ethos. Grandeur involves such attributes as magnificence, vehemence, vigor, and splendor (Bernini). Ethos, on the other hand, comprises simplicity, sweetness, subtlety, and modesty (della Valle).133 If one is to think back to Cicero's model of rhetoric in which there are three modes of expression-the grand, the middle, and the low-then one would probably want to see della Valle as rhetorically positioned somewhere away from the extremes, beneath the grand and toward the middle. In that Bernini was della Valle's most powerful sculptural ances- tor, especially within the context of the basilica of Saint Peter's, it is worth making further comparisons between Saint John of God and Berini's Longinus. First of all, Bemini erected his statue as part of the series of four over-life-sized figures surrounding the Baldacchino and 133 See Hermogenes on Types of Style, trans. Cecil W. Wooten (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1987). 79</page><page sequence="90">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY representing the relics in the upper niches of the grand piers at St. Peter's Crossing. Insofar as both della Valle's and Bernini's statues are part of a larger grouping, they have something in common. Also, they relate to religious texts. "And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God." (Mark, 15, 39). Bemini had the task of representing in marble, on a scale of about three times life size, a theophanic moment: Longinus experiences a profound recognition and is in turn illuminated by the light of Christ's nature. The Biblical account then becomes a pre- text, one which figures in the grouping (there are other statues to con- sider), and presentation of the statue. Rather than place the saints that surround the Baldacchino in the open space between the piers and the altar, Bemini chose to hollow out niches, which is a gesture not just of hollowing, but of hallowing, clearing a sacred precinct for the statue, so that he is set apart, as in an ancient arcosolium or aedicula. Doing this has the practical advantage as well of keeping larger floor spaces open for worshippers. By having the figure of St. Longinus surrounded by a niche, Bernini keeps the figure framed and therefore isolated. As Derrida writes in his Truth in Painting about the frame or parergon (and the niche here is indeed a frame) as an element in the general text and how the niche as frame is separated not only from the work "but also from the outside . . . from the space in which statue or column is erected, then, step by step, from the whole field of historical, economic, political in- scription in which the drive to signature [Berini's creation] is pro- duced."'34 The value of Derrida's discourse on the frame, which is extensive, intricate, and fraught with ironies, intertextualities, and decon- structions, is that he sees frames as something beyond the physical, as permeable barriers through which meanings can pass. In a sense, the arcosolium distinguishes the St. Longinus from other texts, including the Biblical one, without precisely detaching it or excising it from these reservoirs of meaning and tradition. But the frame is not just a separator, an un-meaning zone (as I suggest above in my reading of della Valle's tomb), it too is a kind of text. This text orients the observer and his or her point of view, which is formatted by the niche and is limited to the frontal. Such a determining of the beholder's position allows the gar- ments to be presented in a dramatic way-curving, undulating, nearly 134 Jacques Derrida, loc. cit. (see note 125) p. 61. The separation is not as simple as it might appear in this quotation; Derrida succeeds in problematizing both frames and the "drive to signature" throughout his text. 80</page><page sequence="91">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE pulsating-and for the outline or silhouette to be broken up by the same crushed and trembling drapery patterns. Longinus opens his arms broadly and gazes toward the implied image of Christ on the Cross (the Crucifix was originally planned to surmount the Baldacchino but was not realized). Filippo della Valle's statue of St. John of God (1745, plate 55) is of similar scale and resides in a niche not far away. It differs from Bemini's in that it has no implied counterpart outside the space of the niche-which makes this arcosolium even more separable from the other, physical texts in St. Peter's-nor is it a component of a larger, dynamic, and narrative sculptural program (in the sense that St. Longinus interacts with Sts. Veronica, Andrew, and Helena). It is, just the same, one part of a series of figures representing the founders of important religious orders; so, although John of God neither looks nor gestures toward an invisible complement, in the same way that Bernini's figures often do, he finds himself situated and honored within an ideological context that promotes the founding of organizations that foster the mission and glory of the Church. One might say that this reference to religious organizations is part of the indexical sign system (as in the work of Charles Sanders Peirce). Della Valle's niche, as is true for the other Founders but unlike Bemini's for Longinus, is relatively narrow and confining (John's left hand, which pulls the winding sheet outward, breaks the frame). The sense of extroversion and hypertrophy so common in the seventeenth century is here reduced, diminished, almost relaxed. Those elements of surprise, of the marvelous, of complex and sometimes self-referential conceits had been dropped, almost like hot potatoes, by Filippo della Valle. I keep referring to della Valle as the author of this work, but the design or invention was shared with Pietro Bianchi, as the record shows.'35 Because I have not found Bianchi's original drawing, I cannot tell what precisely was the contribution of each artist. And this leads to a perplexing issue: How does one judge the invention or creative capacity of an eighteenth-century sculptor who sometimes relies on preparatory 135 Carlo Giusppe Ratti, Delle vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architettti genovesi, HI (Genoa, 1769) p. 303; he writes in his entry on the Genoese painter Pietro Bianchi that he helped della Valle with the design for the statue: "A Filippo della Valle lavor6 il modello della bella statua di S. Giovanni di Dio, che questo Scultore condusse per la basilica di S. Pietro.. ." For Bianchi see Anthony M. Clark in Paragone, XV (1964), no. 169, p. 42, and Clark, Studies in Roman Eighteenth-Century Painting, selected and edited by Edgar Peters Bowron (Washington, D.C.: Decatur House Press, 1981) pp. 48-53. 81</page><page sequence="92">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY drawings by others? As Anthony Clark informs us, Bianchi provided sketches for other Roman sculptors as well. In some critics' minds and in the discourses of twentieth-century art history, della Valle's reputation is lessened by the knowledge that not all the designs for his works were his own. How does one prepare a critique on authorial vision when one cannot adduce it from the work itself, when the documents show that someone else did preliminary drawings? This is a provocative question in traditional criticism. Who did it? Who originated the idea? Who takes credit? Upon whom do we lavish (or withhold) praise? As Derrida might ask, how do we engage with issues of restitution here? What reparations, if any, are called for? It is not easy to establish an original artistic voice for this statuary group. There are two artistic personalities making differ- ent but hidden claims upon the sculpture, and so we run up against the problem of influence, of agent, and of actor. And also of the duality of the sign. There is the supposed drawing by Bianchi in one medium, and then della Valle's quotation in another. To what extent is the quotation accurate or inaccurate, appropriate or inappropriate, a "transcoding" (reinterpretation) or a "faithful" copying? Della Valle was likely no semiotician and would have worked pretty much automatically and unconsciously in his adaptation of Bianchi's image. Just the same, art historians have struggled with the matter of comparing final product with preliminary sketches, modelli, and ideas, and certainly art historians have been interested in collaboration between those who do the preliminary and those who do the finished work (of course in our critical age of semiotics and deconstruction, we are not likely to accept such terms as "preliminary" and "finished" as unproblematic signifiers). The cult of the original seems to have carried somewhat less weight in the settecento, an age of collaborative (Bianchi hired sculptors to prepare small models for the figures in his paintings) and intertextual abundance, than it did in the Renaissance and than it does today.136 A "Contumacious" Woman in Saint Peter's: Della Valle's Monument to Saint Teresa There are, of course, famous images of Saint Teresa in Rome. Bemini's in Santa Maria della Vittoria had by the time of the unveiling of della 136 I discuss the concept of intertextuality briefly in the commentary on the Corsini Chapel; see above, pp. 36ff. 82</page><page sequence="93">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE Valle's figure in 1754 given distinction to the state of ecstasy in Tridentine Rome. But della Valle's is the first in Christendom's greatest basilica and suggests an overcoming of one of Saint Paul's famous dictum, that women should not "speak" in churches: "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church." (I Corinthians 14:34- 35). The papal nuncio in Spain wrote during Teresa's lifetime that she was a "restless gadabout, a disobedient and contumacious woman, who invented wicked doctrines and called them devotion,. .. and taught others, against the commands of St. Paul, who had forbidden women to teach."137 All of Teresa's writings were in the hands of the Spanish Inquisition, and several were recommended for burning. Only with some editing of her writing and her beatification in 1612, followed by the canonization in 1622, were all of her texts sanctioned. Just the same, in her Way of Perfection, the following words in response to Saint Paul were so thoroughly revised by churchmen, that only recently have scholars been able to recreate them from the autograph copy in Valladolid: "Lord of my soul, you did not hate women when You walked in the world; rather you favored them always with much pity and found in them as much love and more faith than in men" Della Valle's rendering of St. Teresa is more conservative than Bernini's, whose interpretation of the ecstatic state illustrates an event often accompanied by the most cautionary language on the part of churchmen.138 Della Valle shows Teresa in the fairly common pose of a divinely-inspired scribe. Camillo Rusconi's monumental statue of Saint John the Evangelist (figure 16), part of the Apostle Series in San Giovanni in Laterano, undoubtedly provided della Valle with the basic attitude and posture for his equally monumental figure. Della Valle had already worked on a vast scale (that is, several times larger than life) a decade earlier with his statue of St. John of God, but this time he was- apparently-without preliminary drawings by a painter. So he turned to 137 Reforma de los Descalzos, vol. 1, bk. f, ch. 30, from The Complete Works of Saint Teresa of Jesus, trans. E Allison Peers, 3 vols. (London: Sheed and Ward, 1944-1946), 3: p. 150, n. 2. I came across this quotation in Alison Weber, Teresa of Avila and the Rhetoric of Femininity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990) pp. 3-4. 138 Even Teresa herself was contemptuous of the rage for ecstatic experiences among the religious in Spain. 83</page><page sequence="94">84 PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY 1969 ROMA IS Giovann,i iS.

Both figures are about to record a divine message and therefore each faces heavenward while holding an open book in one hand and quill in the other. Whereas St. John's posture is erect, St. Theresa's follows an S-curve, with her upper torso canting and her right shoulder descending. The open folds of St. John's drapery fulfill the needs of baroque rhetoric: they attract and hold the attention of the multitudes. Della Valle adopts the fiction of a self- absorbed narrative: there is no beholder. Drapery plays little role beyond the descriptive and ornamental and does not attract the attention of the viewer in Saint Peter's with the same insistence of baroque drapery. In contrast to della Valle's earlier relief of St. Theresa (Santa Maria della Scala), he has chosen here a quieter moment in the saint's life. She writes her Vida. Della Valle, secure in his translation of a quiet mood, works on a monumental scale, in a style reminiscent of the baroque classicism of an Algardi or a Duquesnoy, but with a more fluid drapery style. Except for lilies, a symbol of Teresa's purity, and the thorns, a symbol of her visions of the Passion of Christ, della Valle suppresses his love for detail, suggesting that in his mature years he has thought about the requirements of large-scale sculpture. The book held in Theresa's hand cinches her habit at the waist, thereby securing the major drapery pattern of the composition. The folds are simplified and heavy, reflecting her reposeful calm. Yet a feeling for graceful movement is retained. The hem of her mantle, as it descends from beneath the book, follows a gently meander- ing course; it is a zigzag pattern without abruptness. Only in Theresa's veil and wimple does della Valle betray his penchant for crinkly cloth. What I am suggesting by this description of della Valle's style is that Teresa "speaks," but not with her strongest voice. Her autobiography originates not with herself but with God. She does not exhort the congre- gation so much as she poses as a humble receptacle of grace and illumi- nation. She is both in the presence of the Prince of the Apostles (Saint Peter), and, theophanically, before God as he appears to her in one of her visions. As a reformer (the inscription reads S. TERESA SPIRIT. MATER/ FUNDATRIX/ NOVAE RIFORM. ORDINIS/ DISCALC. B. M. DE MONTE CARMELLO), Teresa reinforced the ideals of monastic withdrawal and contemplation. The Council of Trent in its concern over 139 R. Enggass, loc. cit. (see note 41) p. 100, identifies a drawing by Maratti in the Holland collection in Newcastle upon Tyne (W. Vitzhum, Burlington Magazine 110, 1968, p. 362). 85</page><page sequence="96">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY "abuses" in convents had instituted compulsory claustration; della Valle's rendering of Teresa strikes me as consistent with this spirit of clausura. 40 In her submissive pose, Saint Teresa (d. 1582) saw herself as a member of the "little women" or mujercillas, and cast her own language in the simplest and least rhetorical of styles. Of course her strategic choice of a popular, vernacular, direct or colloquial language was a skill- ful rhetorical move. As Alison Weber has shown in her text on Teresa of Avila and the Rhetoric of Femininity, Teresa's decision on usage "was self-conscious, alternatively defensive and affiliative, and above all subversive; it allowed her to break the Pauline silence."141 Similarly, della Valle's cautious style, mildly if not insistently subversive, does less to promote Teresa's highly eroticized language142 and visionary passion in Beminesque terms than to present her as a reforming nun whose place in the sanctuary of Saint Peter's is fitting and whose Book of Her Life is an edifying guide to the spiritual path. The Roman Catholic Enlightenment, which exists side-by-side with the Counter-Enlightenment, found expression in Benedict XIV's examination of miracles. He subjected the evidence of miracles to judi- cial review and, when the miracles involved healing, to medical confir- mation. He did not wish to eliminate the miraculous from Roman Catholicism, but did strive to expose it to critical investigation so as to determine miraculous events in the light of nature. The German Mutschelle believed that the "inner" word of God-what Teresa experi- ences-gives us a language that is undeniable and non controversial. It is 140 The abuses in convents probably sprang more from the extreme poverty than from any licentiousness. Teresa's own sisters in her first convent in Avila left only to return home, such was their indigence.

Mirollo, "The Death of Venus: Right Reading of Baroque Verbal and Visual Texts, The Image of the Baroque (New York: Peter Lang, 1995) pp. 203-219, writes of the paradoxes of "sexy" baroque imagery in which one in a sense misreads the erotic for the divine but does so in a manner consistent with Catholic orthodoxy. These paradoxical conceits-Bernini's St. Teresa as an instance both of agape and eros-were not consis- tent with the more conservative notions of settecento poetics. 86</page><page sequence="97">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE natural and it is reason.43 The "natural" miracle interested Mutschelle more than the supernatural one. He wrote about miracles as an enlight- ened Roman Catholic: "Man has a passion for miracle because only what he considers to be an extraordinary miracle seems to him to be worthy of God and not that which, though ordinary, is nevertheless much more miraculous and worthier of God. He wants an isolated, special, transitory appearance from the other world; is then everything in this world that has appeared in the heavens and on earth and has continued for thousands of years, is all that nothing to him? To him, only the extraordinary, single event is miraculous. Does this mean that the ordinary course of things, preserving unaltered its measured pace in a million different combina- tions, is not?"144 Mutschelle could be characterizing the audience of Bernini's Saint Teresa in Ecstasy as those who want the "extraordinary, single event." nD _ ELLA VALLE'S PRIVATE AND OTHER PUBLIC COMMIS- sions in this period, if not equal in importance to his work in St. Peter's, demonstrate his central position in the industry of sculpture in mid-eighteenth-century Rome. In 1743, Horace Walpole received della Valle's portrait of his mother, Catherine, Lady Walpole. This appears to be the first in a series of copies after antique statuary by della Valle that were sent to England to decorate country houses and satisfy the antique tastes of English gentlemen. The statue dedicated to Lady Walpole is a copy after the statue of Livia (or Pudicity) originally in the Mattei Collection, and now in the Vatican. The Mattei collections of antiquities were first published, with illustrations, 143 The external word of God is an "alien command"; the internal word, which wells up within each one of us, is natural and everywhere the same. "Over the Word of God as preached to us or passed off to us by other men, how much dissension and difference of opinion, how much splitting into sects and churches; how much mutual hatred, persecu- tion and condemnation, how much carping, time-wasting, brain-consuming polemical rubbish, how much fighting with pen and sword, how much murder and slaughter! But over god's Word as presented to us by our own reason, is there here too dissension, strife, and battle? Here only one voice speaks. Here is only one community, one universal Church comprehending all reasoning peoples-one Shepherd, one fold and one flock." Friedrich Heyer, The Catholic Church from 1648-1870, trans. D. W. D. Shaw (London: Adam &amp; Charles Black, 1969) p. 46. 144 Ibid., p. 96. 87</page><page sequence="98">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY by de Rossi in 1704.145 Nicholas Penny and Francis Haskell have traced the Pudicity's fortunes in the eighteenth century and have documented its growing fame.46 The editor of a French guidebook to Italy, Voyage d'Italie (5th edition), remarked that this face was the finest he "ever saw upon a statue," and the Richardsons claimed that it was one of the "finest Figures in Rome." Haskell and Penny believe that Horace Walpole may have chosen this as an appropriate statue to remember his mother, because all of the names associated with the portrait-Livia, Sabina, and the two Faustinas-"had been the consort of a great statesman." The mournful appearance of Livia may also associate her with the tragic muse Melpomene (Haskell and Penny quoting Winckelmann). In August of 1743, Walpole wrote to Horace Mann about his receiving the statue and his disappointment with its appearance: "the face is not so broad as my nail, and has not the turn of the antique. Indeed, La Valle has done the drapery well, but I can't pardon him the head." (Cat. no. 28) It is precisely the kind of proportion, the treatment of the mask of the face, and-and to a lesser extent-some of the handling of the drap- ery, that distinguish this statue from the original and reveal della Valle's style. Here, as in his other copies, he refuses to subordinate his own manner completely to the antique model. Della Valle's ingeniousness (as noted by Joseph Baretti-see above, p. 3) was such that he never worked against his natural talents-his ingegno-to achieve a copy that could be mistaken for an original. He probably had neither the heart nor the talent for forgery. The number of commissions declined for della Valle in the last twenty years of his life, yet he was still to produce some of his most monumental and important work. As Rome generated fewer demands for public art than it had in the previous two centuries, della Valle found more of a market outside the city. Christ's Body Lamented by Angels, probably dating from the 1750s, was used in the nineteenth century as part of the decoration for the chapel in the Chateau de Borely (and now is in the Musee Borely). We do not know its whereabouts before the mid - nineteenth century, but it is entirely possible that the marble relief was sent directly by della Valle to a patron in France.

On 15 January 1763, James Adam wrote to his sister Nelley, "I would gladly know if any of those things that are finished for my Lord Northumberland should be sent now ... there are the two statues by Valle... ." (see Cat. 45). As Honour has pointed out, the figures by della Valle must form part of the ensemble in the Dining Room at Syon. Based upon stylistic evidence, one can attribute both the figures of a Muse and Flora to della Valle (plates 84 and 85). In 1750, he sent another two figures to England, this time to Lord Malton at Wentworth Woodhouse, where one of the figures remains. The two signed works by della Valle are copies of the Capitoline Flora and the Louvre Germanicus. And, as della Valle was receiving commissions from abroad, he graced Roman churches and a public fountain with some of his most elegant pieces: The Sampaio Monument in Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi (1756; plates 73-76), and the figures of Health and Fertility on the Trevi Fountain (1759-1762; plates 77 and 78). Metalwork and Two Filippo (della) Valles Della Valle learned the art of metalwork either from his uncle, Foggini, or from Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, the Master of the Mint in Florence, early in his career.147 Before he left Florence in 1725, he had struck at least two portraits, one of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the other of Prince Giovanni Gastone de' Medici. In Rome in the 1740s we find a "Filippo Valle, ottonaro" casting festoons and grotteschi for Benedict XIV's Coffeehouse on the Quirinal, making an altar tabernacle and cross for the Cappella dei Penitenzieri at San Giovanni in Laterano (destroyed), and fashioning numerous fittings and ornaments for the pope's carriages. He also figured in Benedict's commission for a new high altar for Sant'Apollinare, where the ottonaro-bronze or brass caster-worked under the direction of Ferdinando Fuga. He was responsible for casting two heads of putti, lions' paws, an altar taberacle, corices, and grotteschi.

AND STYLE the twin putti in Santa Maria Maggiore, I had believed that Filippo della Valle, scultore and Filippo Valle, ottonaro were one in the same. Jennifer Montagu and others have maintained that these men are in fact distinct personalities (the "della" is by no means an invariable usage).148 As she points out, it would be highly unusual-in fact, unprecedented-for a sculptor also to be an ottonaro. Having looked again at the heads in Sant'Apollinare (figure 17), and reviewed signatures on documents in the Vatican's Secret Archives, I now agree with Ms. Montagu. The style of the bronze heads is not altogether dissimilar to della Valle's style, but it does differ. Robert Enggass has pointed out to me, for instance, that della Valle never would have fashioned so narrow a bridge on a putto's nose. He is right, of course, as he usually is about matters of personal style in eighteenth century sculpture. And as Montagu has pointed out in relation to the documents for the Sant'Apollinare commission, one can interpret them to mean that Alessandro Giusti modeled the original casts from which the ottonaro (not the scultore) Filippo Valle made the final bronze heads. rT ?O A LARGE EXTENT, DELLA VALLE'S FAMILY SHARED HIS artistic interests. In November 1733, he married Elisa (Silvia) Paziani, by whom he was to have eleven children. He was nephew and cousin to sculptors. His daughter Camilla was a painter (they share a tomb at Santa Susanna) and to his son Pietro he left the tools of his trade. A witness to della Valle's marriage was the French architect Antoine Derizet. Four of della Valle's daughters married artists. One son, Claudio, succeeded at first as a prelate, but later was to become strongly anticlerical and a radical democrat and agitator for a unified Italian republic. He was imprisoned for two years in the 1790s by the pope. 149 Filippo della Valle's official position in artistic Rome was impressive and consonant with his role as the foremost sculptor of his age. He was Principe of the Accademia di San Luca for a total of four years (1752, 1753, 1760, 1761) and reggente of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi del Pantheon in 1747, 1757, and 1762 (he joined in 1744).

XIV), but what duties or remuneration were involved is not clear. He also was a member of the Accademia degli Arcadi. There is documentary evidence of three pupils, stylistic evidence for a fourth, and the possibility that a number of others will be discov- ered. The pupils we know of are the Spaniard Francesco Bergara (Ver- gara, 1681-1753), the Roman Tommaso Righi (1717-1802), and Ignazio Marabitti (1710-1797), from Palermo. Giovanni Battista Grossi worked in his style (Memorial to Colonna, SS. Apostoli) and alongside della Valle at the Trevi Fountain. He may have been a pupil. In 1766, della Valle recorded his testament: "Considerando Io Filippo del q[uonda]m Franco. della Valle Fiorentino abitante in questo alma Citta di Roma esser nato al Mondo per dovere una volta morire, e non essersi cosa pii certa della Morte, ne piu incerta dell'ora, e punto di quella, percio Ritrovanomi per grazia di Dio sano di mente, benche infermo di corpo ho rivoluto per quiete, e vantaggio della mia numerosa Famiglia fare il pressente mio ultimo municipativo testamento, quale di mia spontanea, e deliberata volonta, e in ogni altro miglior modo, che posso, e devo so, ed ordino...." His assurance of his own mortality soon was confirmed. After suffering the effects of a stroke (his avocato writes in his authorization of della Valle's testament that the sculptor habitualis infirmitate apoplesie laborans). He died on 29 April 1768, in his seventi- eth year. Conclusion: celebris in hac Alma Urbe Sculptor In this study of Filippo della Valle, I have tried to present him as a part of his age and at the same time as a sculptor whose very artfulness breaks down the traditional way in which art may carry a meaning or an ideol- ogy. He does not so much subvert the central institutions of his time as represent them in such a way as to reveal the ambiguities and ambiva- lence of a patriarchal establishment some of whose instinctive and tradi- tional avenues of power had become blocked and frustrated. With Filippo della Valle, history and representation come together in an uneasy but revelatory manner. Neither the settecento nor the Roman Church can be seen as utterly discredited, either by historians or as embodied in the art of the time. Just the same, virtually no one has argued that Roman culture or the Roman Curia dominated Europe in the eighteenth century. Hans Gross' observations that this Tridentine city was weakened and its insti- 92</page><page sequence="103">LIFE, WORK, AND STYLE tutions enervated are essentially consistent with commentaries from historians of the eighteenth century to the present. Because of its original sense of pulling out nerves or sinews, enervation is in fact an apt term. We should be cautious, however, about historical dismissals, denuncia- tions, and eviscerations. One cannot deny Rome's presence in the eigh- teenth century as a locus of tradition, culture, and art; as a goal of Roman Catholic pilgrims; as a glorious city of churches, frescoes, and public sculpture. Della Valle surveyed the artistic traditions and texts of this city and incorporated form, imagery, and manner of presentation from numerous other repositories of visuality and meaning. He was, as I indi- cate in my discussion of the Corsini Chapel, an intertextualist, one who was neither a borrower nor a plagiarist, but an artist who could embody and consolidate into his own art much of Roman art history from the preceding two or three centuries. What seems to result is an art with a semiotic tendency toward a dysteleology or an autoteleology. Filippo della Valle's sculpture, in its sweetness and artfulness, in its delicacy and sophrosyne, in its nearsightedness and occasional inaccessibility makes known indirectly but succinctly the status of a city, of an artistic tradi- tion, of a class system, and of a profoundly serious but temporally weak- ened religious institution.

ACCADEMIA DI SAN LUCA, ROME JOSIAH, KING OF JUDAH, GIVING MONEY FOR THE TEMPLE 1725 Terra-cotta relief Plate 1 A relazione published by the Accademia di San Luca, II Trionfo delle Tre Nobili e Belle Art ..., lists Filippo della Valle and Pietro Bracci as co-winners of the first prize in the sculpture competition. The assign- ment, as set out by the Academy, was to "rappresentare in bassorilievo di greta cotta Giosia Re di giuda, che consegna il denaro raccolto ad Amasia Govematore della Citta, a Safano Cancelliere, a Iota Segretario ed al Pontefice Eliacia per fare la spesa di ridurre il Tempio a sua perfetto termine e compimento." This probably was della Valle's first work exe- cuted in Rome. The story of Josiah consigning the money to carpenters and to other workmen for the repairing and rebuilding of the temple of Baal and Asherah is recounted in 2 Kings 22. In della Valle's relief, the young 95</page><page sequence="106">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 1. Josiah, King of Judah, Giving Money for the Temple, 1725, Terra-cotta relief, Accademia di San Luca, Rome. 96</page><page sequence="107">CATALOGUE Josiah, resembling Alexander the Great, sits on a rococo throne, which is atop a pedestal carved with later episodes of the story. Workers, weighted down with money from the Temple, pour their riches into a chest. The High Priest Hilkiah and secretary Shaphan stand before Josiah, receiving their instructions for the rebuilding of the Temple. The lines of perspective established by the classical architecture converge at a point on the far right, thereby decentering the composition somewhat. The great piers and columns of the king's palace, the classical portico before a domed rotunda in the far distance, and the loggia in the middle distance anchor the composition and give it gravity, however asymmetri- cal the whole. The axes of individual figures bend in sinewy S forms around the vertical accents in the composition. The demarcation between planes is clear; likewise, the figures are not confused with one another, but remain distinct, detached entities. The small-scale detail shares in the overall clarity. The shallow reliefs on Josiah's throne could have been treated perfunctorily, but instead della Valle has closely attended to the modeling and arrangement of figures. As a result, the narrative proceeds logically and legibly. This small scene probably refers to the conse- quences of Josiah's gathering of the money for the rebuilding of the temple. The high priest Hilkiah, at Josiah's bidding, removed the money stored in the old temple, but in so doing found a book of the Law. Josiah immediately recognized it as the True Law and realized that in all of Judah "our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book." He feared the wrath of the Lord. A delegation went out from Josiah with the Book of the Law to talk with the prophetess Huldah. She told the delegation that evil was to come, but, because of their penitence, the Lord "will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which (the Lord) will bring upon the place." This relief, then, of Huldah and the delegate of Josiah has great importance in completing the narrative of the larger scene and justifies della Valle's care in its execution.

IL GESU BUST OF CARLO CERRI Cerri Chapel c. 1729 Plates 2 and 3 Of the four funerary monuments in this chapel, three are dedicated to the Cerri family and two of these carry the name of Carlo Cerri. There had been some unnecessary confusion as to which of these is by della Valle. Baldinucci writes in his life of della Valle of a much admired bust of "Monsig. Carlo Cerri degnissimo Auditore della Sacra Ruota Romana [wanting] nella Chiesa del Gesu di Roma." Roma antica e moderna, 1750, lists but one work in the Cerri Chapel, that of a "monsigr. Carlo Cerri," by della Valle. According to Moroni (1841), XI, 101, and (1843), XIX, 170, both Carlo Cerris were Auditors of the Sacred Roman Rota (and therefore, as officers of the papal court, could be referred to as "Monsignor"). Pecchiai (1952, 254) believed that della Valle is responsi- ble for the monument to Cardinal Carlo Cerri (who died in 1690- Forcella V. Iscrizioni delle chiese e d'altri edifici di Roma dal secolo XI fino ai giorni nostri (Rome, 1869-1884) X, 481, n. 798-the earlier of the two Carlos). Galassi Paluzzi on the other hand says that he agrees with Moschini that della Valle is not responsible for the bust of the Cardinal ("Quello di Mons. Carlo che riproduciamo [that of the Cardinal] e opera non ispregevole di un anonimo seicentesco e non, come ha avuto ad opinare il prof. Vittorio Moschini, di Filippo Valle"). But is this the one to which Moschini refers? He writes (I'Arte, 1925, 190): "Non ho parlato del busto di mons. Carlo Cerri nella Cappella Ceri al Gesu attribuito dalle guide al della Valle, perche non so vedervi l'opera di 98</page><page sequence="109">CATALOGUE questi: si tratta di un'opera troppo debole, per lo stesso Della Valle, e poi mi sembra piuttosto anteriore." Save for the reference to an earlier style, which could refer to the bust of Cardinal Cerri, I am not sure how to interpret Moschini's statement. Does it refer to the bust by Domenica Guidi? Moschini was unaware of Baldinucci's manuscript. The problem can be settled by rejecting the earlier Carlo Cerri on stylistic grounds (see below). Both Honour and Riccoboni accept specifically the Carlo Cerri who died in 1726. Galassi Paluzzi also prefers the later Carlo Cerri: "al Valle potra piuttosto attribuirsi il sepolcro di un Cerri datato 1722 [sic]." This Carlo Cerri is completely acceptable stylistically. Honour suggests that the monument would have been erected in 1728, after della Valle established his own studio (Gabburri, 1734-1737, 955: "Dopo la morte di questo maestro [Rusconi], aperse studio sopra di se, ed in questo tempo ha fatto diverse statue che l'anno fatto conoscere e distinguere per Professore gia Maestro [check this citation] perfetto benche sia ancora in eta giovanile.") Rusconi died in December 1728. There is a modicum of expression (or a complete lack, as Honour sees it), befitting an eighteenth-century monsignor and member of the Sacred Rota. Della Valle demonstrates here, as in his other early works, a mastery in the handling of surfaces and textures. He can for instance differentiate between the skin of the face and its underlying bony struc- ture. Cerri has a high forehead with a line running longitudinally across it as demarcation between the tight skin lying close to the bone of the skull and the looser skin lying immediately below-that is, directly above the brow line. Also Cerri's cheek bones project distinctly from his face. The skin sinks into and falls away from this bone in a manner that creates shadow and a subtle sense of leanness and hardness to a relatively well- fed and full face. What animation the portrait does have derives from the head's turning to the left, with eyes focused further left. Inscription: LOCVMTENENS. PROQVE. IOPSO. A.C. BIENNIVM. SVPREMO. MVNERE. PERFVNCTVS.

MUSEO DI ROMA (and Fountain of Marforio) BUST OF CLEMENT XII 1730s Marble Plates 4 and 5 Under the patronal eye of Clement XII, the Museo Capitolino opened in 1734. Built principally around the great collection of imperial busts and inscriptions purchased by Clement from Cardinal Albani, this was Europe's first museum of classical antiquities open to the public (von Pastor, 1952, XXXIV, 498-499). The cortile of the Palazzo Nuovo, containing the Fonte di Marforio, was restored by Filippo Barigioni (Santangelo, II Settecento a Roma, 1959, 95) and a dedicatory inscription to Clement XII was put in place. Clement's bust, however, was not mounted on the wall behind Marforio until 1818. We know this from Tofanelli's description of 1825: "La Fontana, che vi si presenta di prospetto e omata di due Colonne di granito d'Egitto, che racchiudono lo stemma, e la lapide di Clemente XII, dove si legge essere lui stato l'isti- tutore del presente Museo, sotto della quale, sopra una mensola antica, e stato collocato l'anno 1818, il Busto del suddetto Pontefice, onde sosti- tuirlo alla Statua colossale di metallo, che esisteva nel salone superiore." Tofanelli's explanation of the need for the bust (to replace the large bronze statue of Clement XII that had stood in the main hall) suggests that Pietro Bracci's statue (Gradara, 1920, 42) had at that time only recently disappeared, perhaps melted down during the period of Napoleonic domination in Rome. Although Pericoli Ridolfini (1966, 5) claims that the bust was once thought to be by Pietro Bracci (an attribu- tion she favors), I have found no attempt to identify the sculptor before the 1959 exhibition II Settecento a Roma, where Santangelo ascribed the bust to Filippo della Valle. The attribution to della Valle was accepted by Honour in 1959, Pericoli Ridolfini in 1963 (she reversed herself in 1966), Martinelli in 1969, and Pietrangeli in 1971. Della Valle probably executed the bust during Clement's pontificate; its whereabouts until 1818 is not known. It is badly weathered and has been conserved in the Museo di Roma since the 1959 exhibition. A copy has replaced it on the pedestal above the statue of Marforio. This and the figure listed below (Plate 6) are replicas of one another: both figures wear a mozzetta and loosely tied stole (the cords are the same) and have identical silhouettes, drapery patterns, folds, fringe, details, and so forth (the same button is undone). The sitter is identified by his recognizable features: square jaw, mouth drooping at the comers (probably no teeth), and aquiline nose. Among the armorial bearings on 103</page><page sequence="114">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 4. Bust of Clement XII, 1730s, marble, Museo di Roma, Rome. 104</page><page sequence="115">CATALOGUE his stole are the Corsini coat of arms and crossed keys with papal tiara. The work therefore cannot date from before 1730 (his election as pope) and, because it portrays a relatively youthful figure (too youthful, actu- ally), probably not much after. For the bust currently in the Museo di Roma, the chemical reactions brought about by nearly a century and a half in the open air have erased many details, dulled the finish, bleached the stone, and changed the character of the portrayal. One turns, there- fore, to the bust in the Ambrosiana to learn the artist's intentions and examine his means. The carefully worked detail and closely observed facial muscles indicate that the bust was intended for a fairly intimate, enclosed space, not a high perch on an outdoor fountain. The quality of intimacy and the attention to detail immediately suggest della Valle. Further, by comparing the Ambrosian work with a fully-documented bust of Clement XII by this same artist (Rome, San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, Cat. No. 26), the reasons for an attribution to della Valle become more apparent. Della Valle made the portrait in San Giovanni in 1742, two years after the pope's death, for the church's confraternity. Although Clement has "aged" since the earlier portrait, one feels that della Valle's work intentionally falls short of objective realism. The skin hangs more loosely, the creases are deeper, the mouth less firm, the eyebrows show a greater effort in maintaining an alert expression; this is not a purely objective portrait of a man in his eighties, blind and long-suffering. Although the two works differ, these differences are overridden by certain idiosyncrasies of style and technique that reveal the hand of a single artist. The manner of truncating the bust and creating the silhouette are very nearly identical. In each of the two busts, the crease in the pope's mozzetta on the left of his stole has approximately the same dimensions, depth, and configuration. The generally shallow pockets created by the restrained treatment of the garment, with firm, distinct, angular folds, produce a similar visual effect. The two stoles, tooled to the same degree of perfection, lie about the neck, descend his chest, and assume nearly identical patterns; the stoles have the same creases or ridges occurring in like intervals. The same kind of idealism is evident in the two faces, showing a suppleness and muscle tone probably not possessed by the actual subject. The swelling brows, and above these, a nearly horizontal furrow, are as much a peculiarity of della Valle's portrait style as they are an accurate description of the pope's face. In both instances, the iris of the eye is indicated by a crescent-shaped engraved line, with no drilling for the pupil. The similarities of detail, outline, drapery patterns, and modeling between the Ambrosian bust and the documented portrait in San Giovanni dei Fiorentini indicate that della 105</page><page sequence="116">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 5.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY (LONDON) BUST OF SIR THOMAS ROBINSON, MONUMENT TO ROBINSON AND LADY LECHMERE, POETS' CORNER c. 1730 Marble Plate 7 Both Gabburri and Baldinucci mention a portrait of an English gentleman named Robinson (Gabburri: "Fece il Ritratto del Sig. Robinson Inglese in marmo, smegliantissimo che lo mando in Inghilterra . . ."; Baldinucci: "E mentre io scrivo Sta facendo in marmo il ritratto del Monsu Robinson gentiluomo Inghilese .. ."). It is likely that the Robinson to whom the Florentines refer is this Sir Thomas Robinson, an amateur architect who visited Rome in 1730 (Dictionary of National Biography, XVII, 1917, 49- 51). He later was governor of Barbados. Of his two wives, this monu- ment includes his first, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Charles Howard, and the widow of Nicholas, Lord Lechmere. Robinson married again in the Barbados, but that wife did not accompany him back to England. He is buried in the SE comer of the Chancel of Merton Church, where there also is a monument to his memory (Manning, Owen and Bray, William, The history and antiquities of the County of Surrey, London: J. White, by J. Nichols, 1804, 1814, i, 260-261). The bust of Robinson, now attached as a pair with Lady Lechmere, appears to have been damaged on the right shoulder when it was installed in the monument (suggesting that it was not made specifi- cally for this setting-the inscription indicates that his will directed that this bust be "placed by hers"). Although the two figures are close in style, it does not seem that they are by the same artist (perhaps the second was made in the style of the first, so as to serve as a pendant). Specifically, the handling of the planes of the face, the rendering of the hair, and carving of the grotesque mask on Robinson's armor reveal della Valle's hand. The drapery too, as something that is an almost uncon- scious gesture with della Valle, is autograph. There is an oddly familial similarity between the two faces, as if these were blood relations rather than husband and wife. The word "intermarry" in the inscription, however, is for the eighteenth century the normal use of the word "marry" as an intransitive. Despite the family resemblance, the style (or, more specifically, the handling) of Lady Lechmere's portrait is not the same as Robinson's, especially the drapery with its crushed appearance and lenticular creases (something like Bouchardon's style). 109</page><page sequence="120">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 7.

Martina in Roma a concorrenza del Maini che fece gli altri due nel 4 angoli della sudetta Cupola." Beyond Gabburri's unpublished manuscript, della Valle's work at Santi Luca e Martina went unrecorded until this century, when Moschini (unaware of Gabburri's manuscript) accepted the stucco relief of St. Mark (only) on stylistic grounds and what he referred to as a traditional attribution to della Valle (unpublished) of a wax bozzetto for the relief in the Accademia di San Luca. Moschini pointed out, however, that Pascoli recorded a wax bozzetto by Camillo Rusconi for one of the reliefs ("un [wax model] per gli stucchi d'un angolo della cupola del bellissimo tempio di S. Martina..."-1730, vol. I, 265) that Moschini felt was probably identical with the one in the Accademia. He still insisted, despite this uncomfortable evidence to the contrary, that the work is clearly in della Valle's style ("anzi, ad attribuire quel pennacchio al Della Valle m'induce in modo decisivo il confronto col putto del monumento ai SS. Apostoli, altrimenti vi sarebbe molto da dubitare, specie considerando il bozzetto.") Moschini found no documents and had no idea of the work's date. Nevertheless, his attribution is correct. A docu- ment from the archives of the Accademia di San Luca (Doc. VI), published by Noehles in 1969 (361) corrects Gabburri, confirms Moschini, makes complete attributions, reports on the involved commis- sion, and demonstrates that the wax bozzetto of St. Mark is probably not by Rusconi. According to the document, Giovanni Odazzi proposed that he paint the angels on the squinches; Camillo Rusconi, preferring that they be reliefs, modeled the four angels and evangelist symbols in papier mdche and one, that of St. Matthew, in wax. After Camillo's death in 1728, the commission was turned over to Giuseppe Rusconi (St. Matthew), Filippo della Valle (St. Mark), and Giovanni Battista Maini (Sts. Luke and John), all working under the artistic direction of the painter Sebastiano Conca. The document is dated 6th March 1732 (Fleming and Honour, 1967, who neither reproduce the document, nor give full citation for it, date it 6th May 1731). The date of the uncovering of the stuccos, however, is provided by an entry in Valesio's diary, dated 17 October 1730: "Per la vigilia della festa di S.

ART MARKET (LONDON) HEAD OF THE MADONNA 1730s Terra-cotta Plates 9 and 10 In his life of della Valle, Baldinucci mentions, among the young sculp- tor's other works, "una bellissima imagine di Nostra Donna in terra-cotta, fatta per suo studio e conservata appresso di se." It seems that the terra- cotta head left his studio sometime in his lifetime, since it does not appear in his testament (Doc. I). Based upon stylistic evidence, the head in London is, I believe, the missing studio piece. One of the best works with which to compare the terra-cotta head is della Valle's figure of the Virgin in the great relief of the Annunciation in Sant'Ignazio, Rome (Cat. 37, plates 64 &amp; 66). In both figures the headdress pulls backward over the left side of the head, revealing hair brushed into similar patterns over the ear (with one strand falling in front). The grooving and indentations in the headdress have approximately the same configurations and patterns, which are quite typical of della Valle's handling of forms. The shy, handmaidenly tilting of the head, parting of the lips, and averting of the gaze is certainly appropriate for the iconography of the Annunciation 114</page><page sequence="125">CATALOGUE Plate 9.

The slight swing of her torso and the resulting disturbance of her upper garment are also quite close. I also consider the treatment of the ridges of the eyes, the line of the jaw and cheek, contour of the nose (and arcing indentation between nostrils and cheek), sloping forehead, and slight flattening of the chin in the terra-cotta head as personal characteristics of della Valle. Against this one might argue that the handling of some forms, such as the drapery and hair, is more attenuated and smoother in the Annunciation. I believe, however, that the differences in media (clay vs. marble) and technique (modeling vs. chiseling) account for the differences of surface and elongation. The long presence of the terra- cotta head of the Madonna in della Valle's studio undoubtedly had a strong influence on his conception on Mary for Sant'Ignazio.

MUSEO DI ROMA BOZZETTO FOR AN UNEXECUTED, SEATED STATUE OF CLEMENT XII Terra-cotta Published by Martinelli in 1969, this terra-cotta had only recently come to the Museo di Roma from Blanche Gancia, Principessa Boncompagni Ludovisi.

Martinelli further suggests that the bozzetto was submitted by della Valle in competition with other artists and that another's project was chosen, although the commission is not known. The terra-cotta is in excellent condition. Bibliography: Martinelli, 1969, 1-12; Pietrangeli, 1971, 107. 116</page><page sequence="127">CATALOGUE Plate 10.

Photo-luminescent testing on at least one of these figures suggests a late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century date. The presence of cache-sexe on several of the figures also presents strong evidence for a date in the nineteenth century. It hardly seems a coinci- dence that the marble group and a series of terra-cotta replicas turn up about the middle of the last century. The collector who owns the only known figure signed by Cayot, a statue with a clear provenance, then buys the marble, undoubtedly pleased to own another work by Cayot. The terra-cottas were probably sold as eighteenth-century originals, although none of them show Psyche with her diminutive "fly" wing, as we see in della Valle's print. The reason for this is that the marble group, which now also lacks the wing, had been repaired sometime before the terra-cotta copies were made. The third finger on Cupid's right hand has been replaced; this is exactly, according to della Valle's print, where the wing originally appeared. The nineteenth-century copyists could not have know this, of course, unless they had seen the print. Bibliography: L. Gonse, Les Chefs-d'oeuvre des Musee de France, II, 1904, 6, 26; L.G.G.

Copies of Cupid and Psyche Bargello Museum, Florence 1730s Bronze These two small bronze figures were first identified by Ursula Schlegel as being tied to the Cupid and Psyche. Because the figures' poses adhere closely to della Valle's Cupid and Psyche in the Wallace, it his highly likely that della Valle supervised their castings. The figure of Cupid seems the better of the two and reveals della Valle's style, especially in terms of the face and the hair. Basing her observations on the Wallace group, Schlegel also attributes a bronze figure of Leda (in a private collection) to della Valle. This attribution I find less convincing. Although the pose is somewhat related to the Psyche, the handling of surfaces and proportions strikes me as being considerably below della Valle's usual skillful rendering.

SAN GIOVANNI IN LATERANO TEMPERANCE AND TWO PUTTI Corsini Chapel 1732-1735 Marble Plates 18 and 19 Valesio wrote on 18 May 1732 "Questa mattina il card. Guadagni vicario, fece la funzione di gettare la prima pietra nel fondamento della cappella Corsini di S. Giov. Laterano...." Chracas reported in the Diario ordinario on 8 January 1735 that the Corsini Chapel was complete: "Essendosi terminata la fabbrica della magnifica Cappella dell'eccellentissima Casa Corsini, nuovamente costrutta nella Sagrosanta Patriarcale basilica di S. Giovanni in Laterano, omata di fini marmi, bassi rilievi, statue, e bellisimi stucchi messi ad oro, con ottima architettura, a buon gusto in tutte le sue parti...." Honour suggests that the Temperance was in place in the year the chapel was begun (1732) or soon after, because Bracci's relief of Sant'Andrea Corsini was completed then (Gradara, 1920, 98). A somewhat later date is suggested by the book of expenses and payments for the Chapel, published by Caraffa (1974, 301, 307). The entry for December 1733 reads: "A di detto al Signor Filippo Valle scultore scudi cento a conto di una statua, e due putti di marmo"; then again for October, 1734: "Adi 17 detto al Signor Filippo Della Valle scultore scudi trecento a conto"; the last payment comes six weeks later: "A di 24 detto [November] al Signor Filippo Della Valle scultore scudi trecento per resto e saldo di scudi 700 per onorario della statua della Temperanza con due putti di marmo bianco." Alessandro Galilei built the chapel, which is dedicated to St. Andrew Corsini, at the southwestern comer of the basilica, and designed it as a funerary chapel for Clement XII and his family. Above the four small doors let into the base of the chapel's walls are black marble sarcophagi for the Corsini family and niches containing statues of the four Cardinal Virtues. In addition to della Valle's Temperance, there are Giuseppe Rusconi's Fortitude, Giuseppe Lironi's Justice, and Agostino Comacchini's Prudence. Surmounting the niches are reliefs depicting events from the Saint's life. Gabburri's unpublished life of della Valle (probably written between 1734 and 1737) mentions that the artist "ha lavorato in marmo alcune statue per S. Giovanni Laterano." (955). Roma antica e moderna, 1750, gives the first published positive identification: "La Temperanza a mano manca nell'ingresso della Cappella e di Filippo della Valle insieme colli due Puttini sotto...."

JEROME 1733 Marble Dom Joao V, King of Portugal, had vowed from the beginning of his reign (1706) to fulfill his father's wish that a basilica be built for the most destitute of Portuguese friars. The Basilica and Palace of Mafra were finished in 1730. In the few years following the Basilica's completion, Italian sculptors sent statues to Mafra for the niches in the facade and the interior of the grand and enormously expensive Basilica. The king insisted that the statues be "fit to do honor to the artists who made them, and worthy of the temple for which they are destined." (J. Montagu, "Joao V and Italian Sculpture," in The Age of the Baroque in Portugal [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993, 82]). More than fifty statues were sent by the leading Italian sculptors of della Valle's generation. Gabburri indicates that della Valle executed two statues for the basilica; however, only one is signed. M. Ayres de Carvalho has very tentatively attributed an unsigned figure of a Guardian Angel of the Realm to della Valle. Honour feels that a figure of St. John of Matha, normally ascribed to Bracci, may also be by della Valle (see below, Cat. 17-c). A model for the St. Jerome was used by Carlo Ginori for a Doccia figurine.

MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS (SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS) HEAD OF A SAINT/BOZZETTO FOR SAINT JEROME (?) Terra-cotta Plate 22 This is listed by the Springfield Museum as "Head of a Prophet, Circle of Filippo della Valle, 17th Century [sic]." Although this figure wears a covering of cloth on his head, an attribute abandoned in the final work, there are numerous similarities to the Mafra St. Jerome. The curling of the hair over and behind the saint's ear, and then the way the beard descends from the ear and spreads out only to be pushed back by the saint's chin coming to rest nearly on his chest-all of these are similar in treatment to the head of St. Jerome at the Basilica in Mafra. Because a bozzetto, as the sculptor's first sketch, should in some ways differ from the final work, the presence of the headdress can be seen as marking the sculptor's working out of the details of presentation. According to Museum of Fine Arts' files, both Ulrich Middledorf and Fred den Broeder saw some affinities between this head and della Valle's style. When purchased from Lowei-Robertson, Inc. in Los Angeles in 1971, the head was tentatively ascribed to Camillo Rusconi (1658-1728).

JOHN OF MATHA c. 1733 Marble Ayres de Carvalho attributed the statue of St. John of Matha to Pietro Bracci. Neither Gradara (1920) nor Honour acknowledges the attribution. There is no information in Bracci's Diario to confirm that he executed the statue. Honour in his article for the Dizionario biografico degli italiani on Bracci and his article on della Valle (1959) sought to remove the figure of St. John of Matha from Bracci's oeuvre and place it in della Valle's. As for many of the figures sent to Mafra, there is neither a signature nor documents of payment upon which to base an attribution. But Gabburri, who is on the whole reliable, tells us that della Valle sent two figures to Portugal. It seems to me that the figure closest in style to della Valle is the St. John. The hip-sprung pose so typical of eighteenth century sculpture-causing the figure to appear ready to dance-is also 139</page><page sequence="150">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 22.

No. 30), although as mirror image. Those details that strike me as most simi- lar to della Valle include treatment of face and beard (close to St. Jerome), and the somewhat tubular and angled treatment of drapery folds. The crisp manner of handling cloth seems to reflect della Valle's Florentine training with G. B. Foggini. As at St. Peter's, King Joao wished to have a series of founders of religious orders on display at the Basilica. St. John of Matha founded the Trinitarians. 17-D. MEAD ART MUSEUM, AMHERST COLLEGE BOZZETTO FOR 17-C Terra-cotta 1733 Plate 23 This small terra-cotta statue was purchased in 1973 by then museum director Frank Trapp. It was his contention (Masterworks of European Sculpture: Mead Art Museum Monographs, vol. 4 [1983], 11) that the figure was by Agostino Corsini (1688-1772). If I am right in attributing the statue at Mafra to della Valle, then this too is from his hand. Many of the preliminary works for Mafra are still there but often in a badly broken state (as with the St. Jerome, above). This one is in excellent condition. It differs from the final statue in several details, namely in the pattern described by the drapery as it descends immediately beneath St. John's left arm. Also, the saint's right sleeve is rendered in a more circular fash- ion in the bozzetto, but with angular folds falling into a triangular pattern on the statue at Mafra. 141</page><page sequence="152">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 23.

SAN GIOVANNI DEI FIORENTINI MONUMENT TO GIROLAMO SANMINIATI Left aisle, last pier on left. 1733 White and colored marbles Plate 24 From the inscription one learns that Sanminiati was an Auditor of the Sacred Rota, that he died in 1733, and that the commissioning of the monument was directed by his brother Asianino. It is first mentioned in the 1750 edition of Roma antica e moderna: "Nell'ingresso di questa Nave si trovano due Dipositi, uno incontro dell'altro. Quello di Mon- signor Sanminiati e scoltura di Filippo della Valle .. ." Titi, Venuti, Vasi, and Nibby confirm the attribution. The Diario of Valesio gives a few ref- erences to Sanminiati. On 16th July 1730 (Diario di Roma di Francesco Valesio, ed. Gaetana Scano and Giuseppe Graglia, Milan, 1979, vol. V., 249), the diarist wrote "E stato dichiarato datario monsignor Valenti, che mal volentieri ha lasciato l'uditorato di Ruota, che e stato conferito a monsignor Sanminiati, uditore della Signatura, e cioe per riporre il detto uditorato a vicenda ne' toscani sudditi del gran duca e del papa, come era prima, e il posto di uditore della Signatura a monsignor Guglielmi, par- ente del Cardinale Marafoschi vicario." Sanminiati's death also is re- ported by Valesio, not quite three years later: (23 May 1733, 528, vol. V) "Questa mattina, dopo lunga e penosa infermita di una fistola nelle parti inferiori, e passato all'altra vita monsignor Sanminiati, uditore di Rota." The term for this kind of portrait in a funerary monument is an imago clipeata. In the later middle ages and the Renaissance, this return to a portrait signals a shift from the purely eschatological purpose of a tomb to a commemorative one. Sanminiati's image, along with the em- blematic significance of the books, his coat of arms, and the biographical and pious phrases of the inscription, preserve his memory for the passerby, the Christian community, and his family. The direction of his gaze is approximately toward the high altar of San Giovanni, so that he establishes a line of sight with the mystery of the mass. The earliest form of burial in a Christian church, ad sanctos (near the altar) was replaced by the apud ecclesiam (in sight of an altar) arrangement. The putto, expressing in understated terms sadness at Sanminiati's departure from this earth, holds the frame of his portrait. There is some suggestion in this gesture of the angels who assist the transmigration of the soul. This putto has wings and is indeed not far removed from the ranks of the cherubim and seraphim; yet, his function is not precisely that of an angel. The turning of his head suggests not joy at the reward of Sanminiati's soul, 143</page><page sequence="154">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 24.

The putto cannot bear to look upon the "living" image. The books, of course, can have many associations, from the book of life (although the biographical information is contained in the epitaph below), to symbols of learning, theology, and religion. Given Sanminiati's role as Auditor of the Sacra Ruota, all of the latter implications are important. This judicial function on a prelatic tribunal, charged with interpreting the Church's canon, was of the first importance in the Church hierarchy.

JOHN PREACHING Low relief on the facade 1735 Marble Plate 25 Florentines resident in Rome during one of the recurrences of the plague, this time in 1448 just before the Jubilee of 1450 was to spread the dread disease throughout the peninsula, formed an archconfraterity to assist the victims and to ease their suffering (Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica, II, Venice, 1840, 297). In the same year, Giacomo della Porta began the church for Florentines in Rome and dedi- cated it to the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. In 1519 Leo X declared it the official parish of the Florentines in Rome. Clement XII, a Florentine and natural benefactor of the church, made the decision in 1732 or early 1733 (Valesio, 25 February 1733, vol. V, 573: "I1 papa ha ordinata la facciata di S. Giovanni de' Fiorentini.") to rebuild the facade under the direction of his fellow countryman Alessandro Gallilei. Clement shifted money from the Roman lottery into the building fund and laid the cornerstone in March 1733: "Si diede principio al fare i tasti per il fondamento della facciata di S. Giovanni de' Fiorentini, che S. B. fa fare, e vi e stato ritrovato fatto dal principio del secolo scorso." Four reliefs depicting events from the life of St. John the Baptist were placed below the cornice of the first story. They went largely unnoticed in contemporary guides. Roma ampliata, 1739, alone mentioned the reliefs, but without any attribution: "Nelli quattro spazi minori poi che restano fra le Colonne stanno situate quattro nicchie, in ciascheduna de' quali e incassato un Bassorilievo di marmo bianco, ove sono scolpiti alcuni fatti piu riguardevoli di S. Gio. Battista." In 1925 Moschini published the results of his researches in the archives of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, which show that della Valle was paid 300 scudi on September 7, 1735, for the relief of St. John Preaching (Doc. IV). There are also payments, all signed by Galilei, for the Beheading of the Baptist by Domenico Scaramuccia, the Visitation by Paolo Benaglia, and the Baptism of Christ by Pietro Bracci. The Visitation was originally assigned to Berardino Cametti, but was removed from him on 17 April 1735 and given to Benaglia. The contract, which stipulates that the work was to be completed within six months, was signed by della Valle and the other sculptors on 9 June 1734 (Archivio di Stato di Firenze, Carte Galilei, Filza 14). According to Bracci's Diario (Gradara, 1920, 100), his relief of the Baptism was completed in 1734. 146</page><page sequence="157">CATALOGUE John the Baptist, descendent of priests and preparer of the way for Christ, is the patron saint of Florence and the Florentine Church in Rome. Della Valle describes John preaching to the multitudes, shown in condensed form as five figures representing various types: the young, the mother, the elder, and the field worker. John's camel hair cloak testifies to those years before his ministry that he spent in seclusion. This event, then, occurs during the Sabbatic year, when all were relieved of work in the field. John preached throughout the wilderess area along the Jordan. He strides forward, holds a beribboned cross in one hand, and gestures toward the crowd, telling them of the new dispensation and the arrival of Christ in the person of Jesus. The oratorical approach appears to be one based upon quiet reason-note the figure in the lower right foreground who rests his chin in his hand, a traditional and universally recognized gesture of contemplation. It is typical of della Valle to present an under- stated style. A subtle or non-epideictic manner of oratory fits with della Valle's style. At first glance, we have the sense of a tradition-bound gesture of speech. But closer study reveals that innate tendency of the settecento to deflate and diminish the monumental expression: flattened drapery folds and a relatively shallow relief-one which creates subtle changes in valeurs-work counter to the grand manner of rhetoric.

Plate 26 This bozzetto, along with one slightly smaller of the Baptism of Christ, both then in a private collection, were published by Brinckmann in 1924 (vol. II, 118-119) as preparatory terra-cottas by della Valle. As indicated in Bracci's Diario (see above) the Baptism must be Bracci's. Brinckmann's publication date preceded Moschini's by a year, so the question arises as to how he came to associate della Valle with these reliefs (Moschini was the first to bring out the documents). That he also gave the Baptism to della Valle indicates he was not familiar with Moschini's research or Gradara's publication of Bracci's Diario (1920). Rufini (1957, 34) states that before the appearance of the pertinent docu- ments della Valle was thought to have executed all of the reliefs: "Finora gli autori delle quattro figurazione erano rimasti ignoti, e si riteneva che tutte fossero opera del Della Valle." Although I have found no published source for the traditional attribution of the four reliefs, they were proba- bly associated with della Valle because he was known to have done the statues of Charity and Strength over the central door (see Cat. 34). However, since 1920 and the publication of Bracci's Diario in print, his authorship of the Baptism of Christ had been an established fact. Bibliography: Brinckmann, 1924, vol.

PALAZZO DELLA CONSULTA MILITARY TROPHIES Above the lateral doors 1735 Marble Plates 27 to 30 Francesco Valesio, the premier diarist in Rome until his death in 1742, records the progress on the destruction of the old Palazzo and the erec- tion of the new. On 26 April 1732 he tells us that the decision to clear away the ruinous old palazzo had been made, and its occupants had to move: "Essendosi risoluti di fabricare il palazzo per la Consulta in Monte Cavallo, essendo il vecchio palazzo ristorato da Paolo V in stato ruvi- noso, hanno avuto ordine color che lo habitano di partirsene, essendo stato a questo effetto preso dalla Camera in affitto un appartamento della casa posta appresso la chiesa de Lucchesi" (Scano and Graglia, V [1979], 466). The foundation was dug 2 September 1732 (Scano and Graglia, V [1979], 512) and the first stone laid 9 October of the same year: "Questa mattina il Marchese Capponi, foriero di palazzo, fece la funzione di porre la prima pietra con le medaglie nel fondamento della nuova fabrica della Consulta ed a questo effetto vi posero la tenda, non pratticandosi cio in fabriche profane, ne per anco stato fatto a quella della facciata di S. Giovanni, benche si sia da martedi incominciato a riempire il fondamento per non essere ancora fatto il rovescio della medaglia con la detta facciata che vi va posta" (Scano and Graglia, V [1979], 524). Clement XII's dedi- catory inscription was mounted on the building in 1734, but additions were made to the facade after this date. Paolo Benaglia's sculptural group, at the very top of the building (two allegorical figures of Fame bearing the heraldic arms of the noble house of Corsini), was put in place in April 1735, and della Valle received payment for the statues of Justice and Religion over the central portal in 1740 (see Cat. 23). According to Document X, published by Agosteo and Pasquini, della Valle was paid 3500 scudi in September 1735 for the military trophies that were by then in place. Gaddi (1736, 66) mentions the trophies but makes no attribution: "alcuni trofei di marmo allusivi alle memorate Guardie." The first guide book to associate della Valle with the trophies was the 1750 edition of Roma antica e moderna (II, 626). Travertine copies of della Valle's trophies appeared on the Scuderia, which once was across the street (now via 24 Maggio) and near the Villa Colonna. Roma antica e moderna, I (1750), 341 describes this building: "Sono parimenti in questa Piazza tre Quartieri con corpi di Guardia. Non essendo per6 il luogo a parlarvi ne di quelle dei Cavallegiri 151</page><page sequence="162">-Xiii C INE tlI Plate 27.

Sono questi sostenuti da pilastri bugnati e mensole che ne reggono l'architravata, vi sono tre ingressi con sopra alcuni trofei militari scolpiti in travertino da Bartolommeo Pincellotti su modello di Filippo Valle e vengono chiusi da cancellate." Nardini seems to be describing the same building, that is, the stables ("le stalle")-the Scuderia Pontificia, begun by Alessandro Specchi for Innocent XIII in 1722, finished by Fuga for Clement XII in 1731, and restored by Pius IX (Roma e dintorni, 1962, 296): "sotto [the stables] sono le abitazioni che servono di corpo di guardia per i soldati omnate di cancelli di ferro e trofei di travertino che nobilitano molto la piazza" (1741, 185-186). A portion of the Scuderia in its eighteenth-century state can be seen in Panini's painting (in the Coffee House) of the Piazza del Quirinale. Pincellotti's travertine copies apparently disappeared during the restorations by Pius IX. The sculptural groups are the more-or-less traditional collection of military dress and trophies of war, with the ancient symbolism of achievement and conquest. There are halberds, body armor, trumpets, standards, shields, richly plumed helmets, a tethered lion, a dog of war, and an eagle of victory. Not unlike Michelangelo's personifications reclining on sarcophagi in the Medici Chapel (and there are also empty cuirasses by Michelangelo in the entryway to the chapel), della Valle's anthropomorphic but headless suits of armor sit up, twist backward, double over, and casually lean. Behind the armor, banners rise diagonally and billow out as if still in the vanguard of an attack. Contemporaries recognized that the trophies alluded to the "corpi di guardie" (housed in the Palazzo) and the two secretaries of the Consulta (Roma ampliata, e moderna o sia nuova descrizione dell'antica, e moderna, Rome, 1739). The visual effect from the Piazza del Quirinale is one of a richly detailed assortment of ornamental objects (the ensemble required more than 50 carts of marble from Carrara, according to Doc. XX).

Plate 31 The Perentalia Maria Clementinae Magn. Britan. Franc. et Hibern., 1736, describes Maria Clementa Sobieski's funeral of February 1735, with its great catafalque designed by Ferdinando Fuga, in the church of Santi Apostoli. The decision to set up a monument to her in this same church was not made before 1737, when a motion was presented and accepted (recorded and dated 9 February in the church's archives, Doc. III) to this effect. Della Valle's name was not mentioned, nor is it to be found in any other archival document in the church. The contemporary guides provide us with the attribution. Roma moderna, distinti per rioni of 1741 (189) mentions the monument but makes no attribution. Della Valle first received credit in the 1750 edition of Roma antica e moderna: "... con due putti, ed altri ornamenti di fini marmi, corrispondenti all'ot- timo concetto, che si aveva della di lei gran Pieta, e Virtu Cristiane. Ne e stato lo Scultore Filippo della Valle Fiorentino.... II Corpo pero di questa gran Principessa, ancorche defonta di questa Parocchia, che fu in gennaio del 1735 nel Palazzo de Marchesi Muti Papazzurri che &amp; contiguo a questa chiesa, e dove tuttavia abita la Maesta del Re Giacomo d'Inghilterra di lei Marito colli due Reali Principi loro figli, e con tutta la loro Corte, e fattele solenne esequie in questa basilica cinque giomi dopo, con intervento del Sagro Collegio de Cardinali; riposa niente di meno in S. Pietro in Vaticano, dove solennemente ffi trasportato, e dove poi gli fu eretto un sontuosissimo Deposito sopra la Porta, che alla gran Cuppolo conduce." Della Valle's authorship is then confirmed in Titi, 1763, and Vasi, 1777. Maria Clementina Sobieski led a short and troubled life as consort to James III, the Old Pretender to the English throne. The granddaughter of the warrior King John Sobieski of Poland, she repulsed her family's wishes and fled from Innsbruck in 1719 to marry James. Pope Clement XI invited the couple to live in Rome as the King and Queen of England in Exile. They were provided with a villa at Albano and the Palazzo Muti in the Piazza dei Santi Apostoli. Both husband and wife were ardent Catholics, but the ardor in Maria Clementina, coupled with fierce independence, drew her away from her husband and into a Roman convent. They remained separated two years, had a brief reconciliation, then were separated once more by Maria's death of tuberculosis at the age of thirty-three. Her demise in early 1735 is 157</page><page sequence="168">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 31.

And again on 18th January (vol. V., 753): "Sonate le 24 ore, rese l'anima al S. Signore in eta di 33 anni la regina d'Inghilterra con dolore universale." Valesio first noted della Valle's memorial on All Saints' Eve, 1738, (vol. VI, 182): "Nella chiesa de' SS. Apostoli si fa una memoria in pietra della regina d'Inghilterra." The flaming heart is a conflation of several images of piety, as given in Ripa (Iconologia 1603, 402). Fire, when growing out of the head of the allegorical figure of Piety, signifies the inflamed mind's aspiration to God. The heart is an emblem of love and, according to Ripa, suggests one's firm desire to serve with love and nobility, without desire or vain- glory. More specifically the flaming heart is an attribute of Charity, or Christian Love. The heart bums as it loves. The crown withfleur de lys and formee crosses metonymously represents the royalty to which the Catholic King futilely aspired. A work with this many putti triumphs as an expression of feeling rather than as a text of emblematic significance. Our joy and sensuous, pleasurable response is distinct from handbook allegorizing. Della Valle acknowledged the new notion of beauty in the eighteenth century, even before it reached full philosophical articulation. The work's modesty affirms the pleasure of an intimate experience made possible by the denial of monumentality. The two groups of putti, three above and two below, are joined by the stucco rays of divinity, which originate in the same ineffable cloud as the cherubim (again, a recollective identification of these figures from their artistic ancestors-angels). The three heads in the upper zone loosely form an arch, although the impression that the beholder receives comes closer to randomness and spontaneity than formal organization. The two putti below are full-bodied and, together with the cornice that supports the ur, form a triangle of three unequal sides, a configuration that immediately asserts the settecento's indepen- dence of the Renaissance tradition. Both putti in the lower zone are on diagonals; one looks up to the other, who floats beneath an ermine-lined robe, delicately pushing it away from his eyes so that he can look upward toward Baciccio's ceiling frescoes in the nave of the church. The polished, light-colored marble of the two full-length putti contrasts in color and texture with three putti heads above, which are of a flat, gray, unpolished marble. The large, ermine robe that surrounds the putti and drapes over the ur in the lower zone has no pockets or shadows of great 159</page><page sequence="170">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY depth. The cloth breaks in short, V-shapes and zigzag angles, but never violently. Typical of della Valle's style, the putti heads are plump but not fat. The eyebrows are ridged and swell away from the forehead, which is smooth, broad, and high. The lips are parted, the lower droops, the upper appears swollen, bee-stung. The transitions are well worked out the tighter skin immediately below the eye is separated from the swelling cheek by a slightly indented crease. The hair, formed generally by long, graceful, incised lines, is invariably brushed forward into ringlets. The plumpness of hands is not entirely anatomical: the webbing of skin, for instance, between thumb and index finger swells rather than webs, giving the clutching hand an unnatural, but not inappropriate, appearance.

SANTA MARIA DELIA DELLA SCALA ST. TERESA IN GLORY AND TWO CHERUB HEADS SUPPORTING THE ARCHITRAVE OF THE ALTAR Chapel of St. Teresa 1738 Plates 32-35 On 21 August 1734, Chracas described the laying of the first stone for the Altar of the Chapel of St. Teresa, designed by Giuseppe Panini: "Venerdi mattina della scorsa settimana l'Eminentissimo Signor Card. Guadagni Carmelitano Scalzo, Vicario, e Nipote della Santita di Nostro Signore, pose la prima pietra fondamentale per l'Altare, che nuovamente si riedifica in onore di Santa Teresa, nella chiesa di Santa Maria della Scala de' Reverendi Padri Carmelitani Scalzi." The chapel was com- pleted a decade later. Again, Chracas: on 16 October 1745 Pope Benedict XIV came to the church and observed "la nuova nobilissima Cappella et Altare dedicato alla Santa, magnificamente costruito." On the 23rd of the same month Chracas informed its readers of the artists responsible for the 160</page><page sequence="171">CATALOGUE Plate 32.

Filippo Valle. Sopra alli due Frontespizi del medesimo Altare vi sono due Angi- oli, opera del Sig. Maini, uno de quali tiene in mano un Libro colle parole aut pati, aut mori, e l'altro tiene una Disciplina, simbolo della Penitenza. In mezzo poi alli due Pilastri di essa Cappella, che sono pari- mente di giallo antico, e propriamente sopra alle due Porte laterali, con- strutte anch'esse di fini marmi, si vedono due bassi rilievi l'uno di Monsieur Slots rappresentante la Santa trasitta dall'Angelo col dardo, e l'altro del Sig. Filippo Valle rappresentante la Santa in estasi; e i lati della Fenestra sopra il Cornicione della Cappella, vi si veggono altri due bassi rilievi, opera del Sig. Lironi, in uno de quali si rappresenta la SSma Vergine in atto di assegnare all Santa per suo Protettore S. Giuseppe, e nell'altro il nostro Sign. Gesiu Cristo, che l'istruiva nella recita di alcun Orazioni." So, between the descriptions by Chracas of the laying of the first stone and the completion of the entire altar, we have a span of about eleven years: 1734 to 1745. But della Valle's participation can be dated more precisely. Riccoboni dates the relief and cherub heads "dopo il 1728" without providing any source for his information. Honour argued against this date by noting that Slodtz was a pensionnaire at the French Academy from 1728, until 1736 and as such could not undertake an in- dependent commission. Honour then quoted from Gabburri's unpub- lished Vite (1472) that the Antwerp sculptor Janssens, who assisted Slodtz, had carved "un Basso rilievo con due putti in marmo per i pp. della Scala nella loro Chiesa" before 1739. This, Honour suggests, may have been for the same chapel. Souchal found confirmatory evidence for Honour's hypothesis in the church archives located at the Archivio di Stato. The document shows that Slodtz's relief was in place by June of 1738. The same document, although Souchal omits this information, tells us that della Valle's work was also in place by June, 1738. When Berini made his St. Teresa for Sta. Maria della Vittoria, he not only illustrated a combination of transverberation and ecstasy (as a Teresean vision), he ordered the figures according to a sexual conceit: orgasm. Della Valle illustrates a stage of prayer, as described by St. Teresa, and also relies on a kind of conceit, but one of presentation rather than imitation. In other words, Bernini represents (imitates) the transverberation/ecstasy in sexual terms. This theatrically reproduces the effects of climax. Della Valle presents St. Teresa already as a picture, in her own oval frame, with angels inside and outside the zone of representation. Are these exterior cherubim participants or observers-or both? Perhaps there are funereal connections here, with St. Teresa 162</page><page sequence="173">CATALOGUE Plate 33.

We also see here the thematizing of pictorial representation: rather than being a picture, this is about a picture. The inner picture of Teresa on a cloud refers to the highest form of prayer, in which the individual moves through stages of recollection, quietude, union, and on to ecstasy. The goal of the itinerarium is this final stage, in which the senses are overfilled with experience of joy and are thus stunned in their repletion: "Before you can be warned by a thought or help yourself in any way, it comes as a quick and violent shock; you see and feel this cloud, or this powerful eagle rising and bearing you up on its wings ... and indeed see that you are being carried away you know not where." (Life, 136-173).

PALAZZO DELLA CONSULTA JUSTICE AND RELIGION Over the central door 1739 marble Plates 36 and 37 In the Vatican's Secret Archives there is a document of payment to della Valle for these figures. Although the document was published, the results have been curious. Problems of authorship appeared almost from the moment the statues were unveiled. The usually reliable Chracas reported in the Diario ordinario of 31 October 1739: "per rendere maggiormente abbellito il nobilissimo Palazzo della Consulta situato nella piazza di Montecavallo vi sono state poste sopra al portone del medessimo due bellissime statue di marmo, l'una rappresentante la giustizia e l'altra la religione, opera dello scultor Francesco Maini Romao, le quali poi in questi scorsi giomi sono state scoperte alla pubblica vista." With this eyewitness account della Valle's documented authorship of the works is contradicted. The statues are mentioned in Roma ampliata, 1739, but without attribution. Roma antica e moderna, 1750, credits della Valle: "Le due Statue, che sono sopra quello di mezzo, rappresentanti l'una la Podesta Pontificia, e la Giustizia l'altra, sono sculture di Filippo della Valle ...." There the matter stood until this century when Moschini and Riccoboni and others accepted della Valle's authorship without question. Pisano's 1934 article (Roma, 1934, 264) on the Consulta recalls Chracas's attribution, which then came to be accepted by all subsequent authors including Honour (1959, 177), Fleming and Honour (1967, 258), Matthiae (1952, 271), Bianchi (1955, 34), Agosteo and Pasquini (1959, 40), and the various authors of the latest study of the Consulta (Borsi, et al., 1975, 218). Marcello del Piazzo, in his contribution to this last-mentioned book, publishes all documents relevant to the Consulta found in the Vatican's Secret Archives, including the one reproduced in Doc. XI. Yet on every photograph of the statues of Justice and Religion in their text, and in Gabriele Morolli's discussion of the palazzo's history, Maini is named as the sculptor. The statues were added to the building several years after it was completed; in fact, the payment to della Valle is the last one made by the Sagro Monte di Pietc for the Palazzo della Consulta. That Ferdinando Fuga's signature does not appear on the document suggests he had relinquished his authority as architect by this time. Morolli had some strong words of criticism for the statues: "Ed un ulteriore fraintendimento di tale armonia intelletuale sopravenne nell'ottobre 1739, cioe a fabbrica ormai interamente completata, forse 167</page><page sequence="178">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 36. Justice and Religion, 1739, marble, Central Door, Palazzo della Consulta, Rome. 168</page><page sequence="179">CATALOGUE anche all'insaputa o contro la volonta communque del Fuga ... Le due statue del Maini infatti sovraccaricano il portale creando una prevalenza cromatico-chiaroscurale della parte centrale della facciata, ricca di scul- ture, nei confronti delle ali. Ed e questo un fraintendimento totale del fiorentino spirito di equilibrio del Fuga; ed e significativo che le critiche di Milizia, acceso sostenitore della ragione illuministica, a proposito della Consulta, si accentrino proprio su quest'abbondanza di figure scolpite che, come si e visto, ha assunto un aspetto ben diverso dalla parca decorazione scultorea prefigurata dal Fuga" (Borsi, et al., Palazzo della Consulta, 1975, 218). As Morolli indicates, he basically agrees with the Neoclassicist Milizia (an avowed foe of all things baroque) that the faqade bears an unpleasant repletion of sculptural decoration resulting from (in Morolli's estimation) the late and unfortunate addition of the figures of Justice and Religion over the doorway. Actually, the sculptural presentation of this portal owes much of its detail (and, perhaps, overe- laboration) to the Savoy coat of arms, added sometime in the last one hundred years (see the early photograph of the Consulta, plate 37). As Riccoboni observes, the coat of arms between Justice and Religion is not original ("modero, ma rifatto nello stile dell'epoca"). Panini's painting of the Consulta does not show the coat of arms, nor do those nineteenth- century prints published by Borsi, et al. This coat of arms, with a rococo cartouche, numerous and echoing scrolls and reversed C's, shell motif, standards, and a fully detailed coronet, fills the space between the alle- gories and clutters to the point of destroying much of the visual effect that della Valle wished to achieve. If one can ignore this modem addi- tion, the statues are visually intelligible and do read well from the piazza. From a vantage point just in front of the Dioscuri, the allegorical figures are seen to an advantage. That della Valle modeled the figures to be seen from a distance, and from a specific point, is revealed when one studies the works at closer range. Standing in the doorway, a point of view that breaks with della Valle's intended framing, and peering upward through the broken pediment at the figure of Justice (on the lent) one can see that the left side of her face has been elongated so that the surface stretches back toward her ear. This is, of course, an intentional distortion so that the three-quarter profile will have an illusionistic intelligibility from a specified distance (somewhere in the middle of the piazza).

SAN TOMMASO DEGLI INGLESI TOMB OF SIR THOMAS DEREHAM Left Transept 1739-1741 White and colored marble Plates 38 to 41 Thomas Dereham died in Rome in 1739 (inscription) and in 1741 his tomb, still under construction, was mentioned by Roma modera, distinti per rioni: "Adesso si sta facendo un bel deposito al Cavalier Dheram con architettura del Fuga." (p. 349). And although Venuti repeated the infor- mation on Fuga's participation, the literature on Fuga has remained silent on the project. Neither Roma antica e moderna, 1750 ("il Deposito di Tomasso Dirama pie della Chiesa e scoltura di Filippo della Valle") nor Titi, 1763 ("il deposito di Tommaso Diram e opera di Filippo Valle") mention Fuga; however, the guides that do give him credit for the design are reliable and in one case exactly contemporary with the erection of the monument. The tomb remained in place after its completion in 1741 or 1742 until the Napoleonic occupation of Rome, when the church of San Tom- maso degli Inglesi was abandoned by the English College and reduced to a state of near ruin. In 1818, four years after the return of Pius VII to Rome, the English restored the College, abandoned the old chapel, and moved the tomb to the ancient oratory, which was remodeled and now serves as the College chapel (Donavan, 1843, II, 246). The tomb appears to have suffered little during the hospice's abandonment by the English. The tomb bears the portrait of the last of the venerable and noble line of Derehams of Norfolk (N. Goldie, "The Last of the Norfolk Derehams of West Dereham," Norfolk Archeology, XVIII, 1914, 1-22). Dereham spent several years of his early youth in the Florentine court of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, but his years of greatest prestige were lived in Rome during the pontificate of Clement XII (see text, 53 ff.). Perhaps della Valle knew Dereham. The relief portrait has what could be called a noble bearing: the profile is strong, the mouth and chin are firm and set in an air of determination. He is in full peruke. The curls are deeply carved, creating a strong chiaroscural effect. The portrait lies within a medallion that rests atop a black marble sarcophagus. On either side of the sarcophagus are life-sized allegories of Fidelity and Religion. Religion seems appropriate as a reference to Dereham's acceptance of the Roman Catholic faith and Fidelity most likely refers to his support of the Roman Catholic Stuarts in exile. Religion cradles her attribute, a large cross, and carries it almost effortlessly. As with the Temperance in 171</page><page sequence="182">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 38.

There is a distinct sway to the body as her right hip thrusts outward, her right arm comes diagonally across her body, and her left knee juts slightly forward. Galatea is certainly a more dynamic figure, with her energetic twisting and her drapery sweeping out behind her. Rather than looking down and drawing all the lines of force in upon herself, Galatea looks up and to her right. Della Valle's Religion has a quiet, almost mournful aspect, with downcast eyes and pouting lips. More self-absorbed than Galatea, Reli- gion shows here the self-reflexivity typical of della Valle's antirhetorical stance. The ample figure of Fidelity remains seated and gazes thought- fully up to Religion. Her voluminous drapery nearly engulfs "Fido," one of her main attributes. The dog, standing guard behind Fidelity's skirts, peers out the way so many of della Valle's putti emerge from between divine rays and from behind miraculous clouds. The figure of Fidelity and the relief of Dereham form the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle. Religion is the upright side. The symmetry and stability of a Renaissance pyramidal composition gives way to the asymmetry and elegance of the eighteenth century. The marbles are warmly colored: brownish yellow, brownish red and a muted green with white flecks. The marble that della Valle generally used for his figures has a flat gray finish, but here the marble is honey-colored and slightly veined. I am assuming that Thomas Dereham himself contracted with Fuga and della Valle for the tomb.

SANTISSIMO NOME DI MARIA THE ANNUNCIATION (?) Oval medallion at the base of the cupola 1740 Stucco Plate 42 Following the demolition of a palazzo to provide space for the founda- tions of the new church of SS. Nome di Maria, the laying of the first stone was scheduled for 19 August 1736 (because of bad weather, it took place the next day): Valesio (Scano and Gaglia, 1979, V, 895): "Questa mattina dovea porsi la prima pietra alla nuova fabbrica della chiesa del Nome di Maria alla Colonna Traiana, ma la funzione fi differita al giomo." By 1739, Antoine Derizet's cupola was ready to receive the lead, provided by the pope, which would sheath the exterior. Again, Valesio (Scano and Graglia, 1979, VI, 260, 9 September 1739): "S. Beatitudine ha donata la meta della gabella del piombo che deve servire per coprire la cuppola della chiesa alla Colonna Traiana della Campagnia del Nome di Maria." According to Chracas, the church was dedicated 5 September 1741, at which time the construction was nearly completed, "come si vede, con ogni magnificenza et grandiosita, con vaghissimi omamenti di stucchi, pitture, statue e ogni altro abbellimento corrispon- dente all ben intesa Architettura." Valesio wrote the following day (Scano and Graglia, 1979, VI, 515): "Si vide oggi la chiesa gia terminata, fuori che nelli altari e nel pavimento, della compagnia del Nome SS.mo di Maria nella piazza della Colonna Traiana e Veramente e riuscita magnifica e forse troppo per il luogo." The medallions seem to have been in place by 6 October 1740; it was then that the Galli Brothers, workers in stucco, signed a contract for floral decoration "sopra li medaglione" (Document VIII). The sculptors responsible for the eight stucco reliefs at the base of the cupola were not identified in art historical literature until the publi- cation of the pertinent documents by Martini and Casanova in 1962 (Document VIII). The accounts from the Archivio della Confraternita give the following names: Carlo Tandardini and Francesco Queirolo, two medallions each; Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Battista Maini, Bemardino Ludovisi, and Michelangelo Slodtz, one each. Souchal iden- tified the subjects as the Annunciation, Visitation, Purification (or Pre- sentation of Jesus at the Temple), Assumption, Coronation, Immaculate Conception, Birth of the Virgin, and the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple. For some reason, perhaps because the expenses surpassed the reserves, Slodtz was not paid. A letter from him dated 13th July 1746, 177</page><page sequence="188">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 42.

Here Slodtz lists his medallion, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and dates it 1740. None of the other reliefs can be attributed by documentary evidence. Based on style, Fleming and Honour tentatively ascribe the Presentation of the Virgin to Maini (1967, 258). Ludovisi's contribution is not mentioned by Enggass (The Burlington Magazine, 1968). As Souchal suggests, the Annunciation, because of its relationship to the relief of the same subject in Sant'Ignazio, appears to be by della Valle. However, a drawing of the Annunciation, recently in the art market, London (plate 43), has been traditionally attributed to Maini. Whether or not that ascription is correct, the drawing does not look to be by della Valle. In the Annunciation in Sant'Ignazio and the one here, the angels, with legs bent at the knee, rush into the composition astride miraculous clouds. One hand gestures to God, the other bears a spray of lilies. Their supple, classical anatomy reminds one of the Apollo Belvedere: each wears a loose-fitting garment that rides across one shoulder and under the opposite arm, revealing a smooth pectoral and shoulder. Their heads are nearly in profilperdu so that tousled manes are more apparent than faces. The Virgin Anunciate recoils demurely, one elegant hand to her breast, the other gesturing outward; each in the act of kneeling breaks the picture plane with one leg. There is one element of the facture that may suggest Maini's hand: the forward sweeping drapery. Jennifer Montagu has suggested to me that this is typical of Maini's style. She may indeed be correct; I find it very difficult, in this instance, to distinguish between the close freinds and one-time roomates Maini and della Valle.

Marble Plates 44 and 45 Clement XII Corsini, a Florentine and great patron of Florentine artists and the Florentine national church in Rome, died in Febraury 1740 in his eighty-eighth year. The decision to erect his memorial was made several years later, but the work was not put in place until 1750 (Moschini, I'Arte, 1925, 186). Vittorio Moschini published all pertinent information on the commission. An order for payment of one hundred scudi, dated 6 April 1742, was made to della Valle for a "busto di marmo rappresen- tante la S. M. di Papa Clemente XII per collocarlo nel deposito di memo- ria da farsi in nra. chiesa per la facciata fatta" (church archives, vol. 361, n. 1021). Further information on the fate of the bust comes from vol. 308, 132 f: Not until 30 September 1749 did the Confraterity decide to erect the memorial intended to receive della Valle's bust, which had remained during the intervening years in the confraterity's archives. On 1 th November 1749 della Valle was invited to use any marble he could find in the courtyard of the Florentine Consulate. On 24 February 1750 the Confraternity decided to place the bust where it remains and to consign to della Valle "cinque pezzi di colonne di marmo forastiero, ma ordinario e di poca valuta, di color bigio." The capomastro muratore Giacomo In- ganni presented his bill 27 July 1750 for "lavori di mura" for "mettere in opra il novo deposito accanto alla porta della sagrestia ... con rimettere in opra il deposito vecchio incontra al med?." (vol. 250, n. 115). There have been some questions about Fuga's participation here; the evidence suggests, however, that he had nothing to do with this mon- ument. Honour, apparently misreading Titi (Honour's page citation for Titi actually refers to della Valle's Monument to Innocent XII in St. Peter's). Probably on Honour's authority, Tafuri and Salerno accept this attribution.

It would be interesting to know Nava's source for this information (who was "Magni"? Maini? And, after all, Galilei died in 1737). The documents found by Moschini leave no doubt that the marble for the memorial's architectural frame- work was given to no one other than Filippo della Valle.

Benedict commissioned Ferdinando Fuga to pull down the old facade and to erect a new portico of superimposed galleries. In the lower gallery, antique columns from the old porch were re-used, and in the Loggia della Benedizione an earlier mosaic was preserved. A report by Thun, in the State Archives, Vienna (von Pastor, 1952, XXXV, 158) states that Benedict XIV laid the comer stone for the new facade on 4th March 1741 (the ceremony is also described in Vat. Lat. 8546). Restoration of the church continued until 1750 (von Pastor, 1952, XXXV, 159), consisting, in addition to the portico and its sculptural decoration, certain repairs to the interior: work was done on the pavement and the ceiling and more decoration, mostly in stucco, was added along the side aisles. The Baldacchino was completed with Bracci's angels at the corers (now on the Loggia della Benedizione), and della Valle prepared the models for the torch-bearing angels flanking the Confessio (Cat. 38).

Statue of Blessed Nicola Albergati, 1742, travertine, exterior, Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome. 188</page><page sequence="199">CATALOGUE participating in the exterior decoration were: Giuseppe Lironi, Filippo della Valle, Carlo Marchionni, Agostino Corsini, Carlo Monaldi, Giambattista Maini, Pietro Bracci, Bernardino Ludovisi, Francesco Queirolo, Michelangelo Slodtz, and Peter Verschaffelt (Titi, 1763, 250, who gives the proper attribution of the Virgin and Child to Lironi, not Maini.). Von Pastor believed that, because of an inscription of 1750 over an inner portal, the architectural and sculptural work on the facade were not completed until approximately 1749 (1952, XXXV, 158). An earlier date is put forth by Enggass (1968, 497). He notes that an inscription of 1743 on the frieze of the upper storey provides a terminus ante quem for the architecture and a terminus post quem for the sculpture, which was probably in place soon after. However, Chracas writes that by 5th January 1743 the facade was "gia compita, con tutti le sue statue ed altri ornati che la rendono assai magnifica." Further, a date in 1742 is suggested by Bracci's Diario, which records a bill of 260 scudi for a "basso rilievo nel portico di S. M. Maggiore." (Gradara, 1920, 103). Honour dates della Valle's work "between 1740 and 1743." The documents of payment for the restorations at Santa Maria Maggiore are housed in the Vatican's Secret Archives. These provide a full picture of della Valle's participation. He was paid a total of 1225 scudi for work from August 1742 to May 1743. Part of the payment was made on 3rd August 1742 and again on 23rd November 1742 for "la statua di Travertini" (Nicola Albergati). Another partial payment was made on 21st May 1743 for fifteen heads of putti, the Holy Spirit, and the aureole for the Holy Name of Mary on the pedestal of her statue (which is by Maini-Titi, 1763, 250). Although the date of 5th January 1743 (Chracas) as terminus ante quem may not be strictly true-for della Valle did not receive his payment for another five months-it appears that most of the major pieces were in place by the end of 1742. Panini's painting of that year shows a completed facade. Matthiae (1951, 76) argues, however, that the fagade need not necessarily have been completed at the time of Panini's painting: "poiche l'edificio non era ancora compito nel 1742, il fatto dimostra come i lavori procedettero senza varianti secondo un projetto gia stabilito, del quale il pittore indubbiamente si servi" On the whole, I believe that Panini probably was painting the facade as it appeared in late 1742. Although the payments did continue into the middle of the follow- ing year, there is a fairly common lag between completion of a project and receipt of a final payment. 189</page><page sequence="200">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 48. Statue of Blessed Nicola Albergati, 1742, travertine, exterior, Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome. 190</page><page sequence="201">CATALOGUE The documents from the Secret Archives do not specify which travertine statue was by della Valle. Roma antica e moderna, 1750, is the first to make the attribution: "... ed il gruppo sotto collo Spirito Santo e di Filippo della Valle, Fiorentino... ed il B. Nicola Albergati dall'altra banda del suddetto Filippo della Valle." Titi, 1763, repeats this informa- tion: (describing the two statues flanking the upper storey of the facade) "II s. Carlo e del cav. Queirolo, ed il B. Niccola Albergati del detto Valle." Of the three heads ofputti in marble over the inside doors the one above the central door was apparently removed during the remodelling of the narthex by Pius XII. The most important piece is the statue of Albergati, a pious fifteenth-century cadinal. He wears the cardinal's cap and appears to hold a book in his left hand. He clutches his cassock, arranged in broad sweep- ing folds, and stares over his left shoulder, pondering the square below. Albergati was raised to the purple in 1426 by Pope Martin VI, one of the most exacting pontiffs to attempt reform of the Sacred College. The cardinal, a member of the Carthusian Order, and formerly bishop of his native Bologna, lived an austere and humble life, slept on straw, and wore a hair shirt. He was one of the great humanists of the early Renaissance. Pastor writes of Albergati: "When created a cardinal, in his humility he assumed no armorial bearings, but simply a cross, an example which was followed by his old companion, Parentucelli, on his elevation to the Papacy." (Pastor, I, 1906, 268). Parentucelli, who traveled widely with his mentor Albergati, paid tribute to him by assum- ing the name Nicholas V when he became pope. Although a cardinal of great virtue worthy of public esteem and veneration, Albergati was not numbered among the blessed until October 4, 1744, nearly two years after della Valle completed his statue. Apparently Benedict XIV had had it in mind since early in his pontificate to beatify Albergati. The process of canonization was never begun.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY (LONDON) MONUMENT TO LADY WALPOLE 1743 Marble Plate 52 The monument was commissioned by Horace Walpole for his mother, Lady Walpole, first wife of Sir Robert Walpole; she died in 1737. Rather than a portrait of Lady Walpole, this is a replica of an antique statue known as Pudicity or Livia. The original was in the Mattei collection in the eighteenth century and is now in the Vatican Collections (Reinach, Salomon, Repertoire de la statuaire grecque et romaine [Paris: E. Leroux], I, 1897, 447). Walpole's correspondence with Horace Mann provides the essential information. Walpole wrote to Mann on November 26, 1741: "I beg to know if you have never heard anything from Parker about my statue; it was to have been finished last June." On August 14, 1743, Walpole expressed disappointment over the statue, which he had by then received: "the face is not so broad as my nail, and has not the turn of the antique. Indeed, La Valle has done the drapery well, but I can't pardon him the head." The statue was subsequently erected by Rysbrack for Walpole in its present location in 1754 (also, see text, pp. 88 ff.).

Petri interjectio, sculptamque jam hanc eleganti marmoreo monumento Inscriptionem omnium oculid objicienti..."). The tomb was probably planned as an ossuary and would natu- rally have stood empty for a number of years. It is, in fact, described as early as 1750 in Roma antica e moderna: "Qui contiguo e il Depositio del Card. Pietro Marcellino Corradini, il disegno e di Francesco Cerotti, ed il Ritratto nell'Ovata e scoltura di Filippo della Valle." The factual infor- mation, however, is contradicted by Titi in 1763: "Al lato alla porta del fianco e il deposito del Card. Corradini col suo ritratto fatto da Filippo Valle scultore, che fece il disegno di questo deposito," and in a footnote: "e non Francesco Ceroti puramente scarpellino egregio nel suo mestiero." The tomb, erected at the expense of Card. Marcello Crescenzi (see inscription), was probably begun soon after Corradini's death in 1743. Gaetano Moroni (Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica, XVII, Venice, 1852, 250-251), writes that Corradini was born to noble but poor parents. His father died while Piermarcellino was a boy, and his mother educated him. He came to Rome and soon attached himself to the Papal Curia. In the Consistory of 18th May 1712 he was raised to the purple and, in 1716, became titular Cardinal of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Moroni described Corradini as "grave, integerrimo, erudito. Ebbe ardente zelo per l'onore di Dio, e per la Santa Sede. Fu liberale ed affabile coi litterati, e colla vasta sua dottrina pubblico diverse opere." The architectural setting is in a shallow niche that immediately follows the last chapel in the right aisle. The tomb is made of poly- chromed marble with a variegated grain. A pale yellow and deep red pre- dominate. The ur itself is a dark green. The relief portrait of the cardinal is set against a slate background. The drapery patterns in the portrait seem more varied than in much of della Valle's work. There are many spoon-shaped patterns and short ridges. Where the mozzetta folds back from his sleeve, we see the underside of the cloak, which then folds back over into a lip. There is one fairly deep fold in the crook of his arm that created the main shadow in the portrait. The face, when viewed closely has an almost asbtract quality: the planes of the cheek rise in layers parallel to the background; folds of skin rise from the plane and fall back to it. The fold of skin on the cheek could make no sense in isolation. 199</page><page sequence="210">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 54.

The bunching of the garment on his sleeve also comes out in short, parallel, incised lines, increasing the sense of abstraction. The shallow relief, crispness of detail, beaked nose, sloping forehead, and hairless crown emphasize an aquiline character to Corradini. He is old, his shoulders are hunched, and his head juts forward. He is isolated from us, shown only in a relief profile, contained within an unbroken frame, lost in prayer. His devotion is indicated by his prayerful attitude; his intelligence by the alertness of his expression and the lack of any indication of frailty, despite his wizened appearance. This image of the deceased bears little resemblance to the baroque conception of tomb sculpture. Berini's Gabriele Fonseca (Rome, San Lorenzo in Lucina) actively particpates in our world; he leans from his niche as he would lean from a window, adoring the Annunciation above the same altar before which we pray. Corradini exists in another realm only, beyond life. Inscription D.O.M. PETRO MARCELLINO CORRADINO DOMO SETIA JURIS CONSULTO CLARISSIMO POSTQUAM PLURIMA MUNIA IN ROM.

SAN PIETRO IN VATICANO ST. JOHN OF GOD Left transept 1745 marble Plate 55 Various dates have been advanced for the sculptural group of John of God succoring a sick man. Riccoboni, Honour, and Moschini all date it to 1744 and base their evidence on a dated print (discovered by Mos- chini) by Michele Sorello (Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe, 57, n. 10, 116531). Carl Justi records that Winckelmann saw the work: "In Sankt Peter fillten sich die Nischen mit kolossalen Ordensheiligen, von denen einige besser sind als fast alles fruhere, z. B. die im August 1745 aufgestellte Gruppe des heil. Juan de Dios von dem Florentiner Filippo Valle ... ein Werk, hervorragend durch Wissen, Empfindung und kom- pakte Gruppierung." Huetter and Martini suggest a date immediately before 7 August 1745 but give no indication of their source. The date 7 August 1745 for the dedication of the statue is confirmed by Chracas: "In questi giomi passati si e veduta collocata in una delle Nicchie della basil- ica Vaticana, e propriamente nella gran crociata della Chiesa a mano manca, dirimpetto a quella di sancta Giuliana Falconieri una nobile Statue di marmo rappresentante S. Giovanni di Dio fondatore della Reli- gione di PP. Fate ben Fratelli, fatta ultimamente scolpire dalla stessa Re- ligione dallo Scultore Sig. Filippo Valle di studio vicino alla chiesa di S. Niccola da Tolentino a Capo le Case" [this is the unique mention of the location of della Valle's studio]. This, however, is not the first mention of the statue. In 1741, Roma moderna, distinti per rioni described the nave: "Nella navata di mezzo i putti, che sostengono i vasi dell'acqua sono del Comacchini, e le statue, che si vedono nelle nicchie dei Fonda- tori delle Religioni, sone de' megliori Scultori presenti, cioe Maini, Rus- coni, Valle, Monaldi, Comacchini, e Bracci." The guide seems to place work by della Valle of one of the founders of a religious order in the nave of Saint Peter's as early as 1741. It seems unlikely that we have here a reference to della Valle's St. Theresa, which was not unveiled until 1754. Perhaps the reference is to a stucco group of Saint John of God placed in one of the niches of the nave in preparation for the final work, which was placed not in the nave but in the left transept. C. G. Ratti states that Pietro Bianchi prepared the design of the two figures, which della Valle then executed ("A Filippo della Valle lavoro il modello della bella statua di S. Giovanni di Dio, che questo Scultore condusse per la basilica di S. Pietro..."). 202</page><page sequence="213">CATALOGUE The Spaniard John of God, Calabita, founded the religious order of the Benfratelli, named according to his exhortation when soliciting alms for the poor, "Fate bene, fratelli." As with the other figures along the nave and in the transepts, della Valle works in the traditional "monumental" scale, approximately three times life size. John covers the nakedness of one of the abandoned sick who is dying. He slips from the edge of a rock. He leans heavily against the saint and helplessly allows his hand to open. We experience in the implied narrative the moment of death. The two figures are closely joined. John's hand supports the man's right shoulder and his body sways outward, trying to balance the weight of death. Inscription UNIVERSUS HOSPITALITATUS ORDO S.

SAN PIETRO IN VATICANO MONUMENT TO INNOCENT XII Right aisle 1746 White and colored marbles Plates 56 and 57 Innocent XII Pignatelli (1691-1700) was interred 1 October 1700 in a simple marble sarcophagus in St. Peter's (Gregorovius, 1931, n. 95). Galassi Paluzzi (1963, II, 79) quoted from a manuscript in the Vatican Library (MS Ottoboni 3362) that described the original monument: On 22 November 1692, Innocent XII "voleva andare (da Monte Cavallo) martedi al Vaticano per la festa della Sagra (dedicazione) di quella basil- ica, non meno che per vedere il suo sepolcro gia terminato, ma il tempo l'impedi. Viene questo collocato dirimpetto a quello della Contessa Matilda e consiste in una bella ura di pietra mischia, con una cartello nel mezzo, dove a lettere d'oro vi e semplice suo nome senza minima iscrit- tione, arme, ne tiregno, ne altro omamento." Then, according to the second inscription (see below), the monument was expanded in 1746 at the expense of Cardinal Petra. Chracas credits della Valle with the authorship of the new tomb on 15 October 1746: "Si van proseguendo la gia cominciata erezzione oramai quasi terminata, del nobile Deposito della san. mem. di Papa Innocenza XII. Pignatelli, composto di fine pietre, che l'Em0 Sig. Card. Petra fa costruire proprie spese nella basilica Vaticana, dallo Scultore Sig. Filippo Valle, ne sito propriamente dove ffi collocata l'Uma Sepolcrale fin dalla morte di esso Pontefice, che e dirimpetto all'altro Deposito della Contessa Matilda." Chracas suggests no collaboration with another artist. Yet since Filippo Titi's guide book made the claim in 1763, Ferdinando Fuga's authorship of the tomb's 205</page><page sequence="216">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 56.

Inasmuch as the archives of the Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro in Vaticano retain no records for the expanded tomb, and, as no preparatory drawings by Fuga survive, the nature of his contribution had not been clearly determined until Jennifer Montagu found the documents of payment in the Archivio di Stato di Roma. Matthiae (53) judiciously observed that della Valle would not have been completely submissive to Fuga; but otherwise, he only tenta- tively analyzed the division of labor. The notion that there was any collaboration at all rests, as I mentioned, upon Titi's description: ". . . il deposito della S. M. d'Innocenzo XII Pignatelli, fattogli dal Card. Petra con disegno del Cav. Ferdinando Fuga. La statua del Papa sedente, e le due della Gisutizia e della Carita, con l'altra opera di scoltura di Filippo Valle." Other accounts of the tomb do not mention Fuga. Mercurio Errante, 1760: "I1 depositio ... d'Innocenzo XII fatto a spese del Card. Petra, e opera di Filippo della Valle"; Chattard, 1763-for a full tran- scription see Appendix I-"il tutto fu scolpito da Filippo Valle"; Roma ricercata, 1750: "fatto erigere del Card. Petra e opera di Filippo della Valle. . .."; Roma antica e moderna, 1750: ". .. il Deposito di Innocenzo XII Pignatelli scolpito da Filippo della Valle Fiorentino, ed erettogli nel 1746"; Venuti, 1767: "il grazioso Deposito fatto erigere nel 1746 dal Cardinal Vincenzo Petra Napoletano ad Innocenzo XII suo Benefattore ornato di metalli, e le Statue sono tutte scolture di Filippo Valle Fiorentino, e l'architettura di Nicolo Salvi [sic]"; Vasi, 1777: "...il deposito d'Innoc. XII. omato con metalli dorati, e tre statue di marmo scolpite da Filippo Valle Fiorentino.") The first extensive description of St. Peter's basilica after the construction of the Pignatelli monument, Martinetti and Sidone's Della sacrosanta basilica di S. Pietro in Vaticano, 1750, indulging in word play, specifically contradicts Titi: ". .. nel anno 1746 e stato innalzato per ordine del Cardinal Vincenzo Petra colla spese di circa novemila Scudi Romani. Un solo, vale a dire Filippo Valle, e stato l'Autor del disegno, lo scultore delle tre statue di marmo, rappresentanti il Pontefice sedente in atto di benedire, la Carita e la Giustizia collocate ne' due lati dell'Uma." By reporting the expense of the monument, information that I have not found in any other source, Martinetti and Sidone show special knowledge of the commission. But Petra's documents clearly state that Ferdinando Fuga had been commis- sioned to provide della Valle with a wooden model of the memorial (see Document XXIII). In contrast to the idealizing and monumental tradition of Re- naissance and papal tombs, Innocent appears as he was, old and sickly. He gestures weakly. The frown muscles above his eyes are tensed, 207</page><page sequence="218">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Plate 57.

The tendons stand out in his neck, his skin is loose and leathery. The richness of his vestments and the youth of the allegories act as foils to his frailty. His cope is ornamented with rococo festoons of"S" and "C," curved with tiny cherub faces emerging from the foliate de- signs-a playful variation on the use of grotesques. What may appear at first as thematically incongruous is, in fact, a pun. Innocenza is sur- rounded by innocenti and the idea of innocenza. However, the pun is to be shared only by the pope and his allegorical figures, for the cherub faces are invisible from the floor. The intricate lace fringe that lies about Innocent's feet likewise cannot be clearly seen from below. One's first impression of the tomb is likely to be disappointing. The light is bad, the stone has a flat gray finish, and the elevated position of the monument diminishes the graceful impression of drapery patterns and intimate detail. If the tomb were on a level with the nearby tomb of Gregory XIII and if it were to retain its architectural setting, the visual effect would be altogether different and perhaps, for some, more satisfying. Della Valle, following tradition (although commenting on this tradition as well), had based his composition on the pyramid. One's eye is first drawn in to the lower left side by a putto emerging from behind Charity's legs and skirts. A crinkly drapery pattern flows out from her waist, around her back and up her left shoulder. With her head tilted back and toward her left shoul- der, she looks up to the pope. His gaze leads away from the composition, outward and upward to his right. Seated on the throne, he too assumes a pyramidal arrangement of his own body. However, a trapezoidal element is created diagonally across the main axis by the drapery patterns, which are formed in part by his gesturing right arm. The eye then is drawn to the figure of Justice whose head also turns and tips toward her left shoul- der. Although Charity faces the composition, Justice turns away and acts as a terminus. The putti next to Justice and Charity do not integrate into the main compositional pattern, nor do they destroy it. They seem to be tucked in, without altering the main rhythms. They tend to fill out the group, adding to and varying the visual interest. The marbles are richly colored. The pillars are pink and the sarcophagus is a dark green. The niche in which the pope sits is a light golden brown. The slab of marble supporting his throne had striations of gray and white in an open-grained pattern. Throughout the composition, the pockets of light and shade are shallow, small, and numerous. The effect is neither immediate nor over- whelming. Innocent was a pope without ostentation, one who was an enemy of nepotism and a father to the poor. He asked for and received an unadorned monument. But nearly half a century after his death, Cardinal 209</page><page sequence="220">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Petra expended the considerable sums mentioned above and gave his uncle a tomb of equal rank and splendor to those of the other popes buried in St. Peter's.

SANT'IGNAZIO THE ANNUNCIATION High relief over the altar of the left transept 1750 Marble Plates 64 to 67 The Annunciation, one of della Valle's largest works, drew considerable attention when it was dedicated on 28 February 1750 (see quotation from Chracas in text). Stucco allegories of Humility and Chastity, seated atop the tabernacle, each accompanied by a putto, are by Pietro Bracci, as are the two marble angels on the balustrade before the altar. The entries in Bracci's Diario for these works are dated 1749 (Gradara, 1920, 104-105). According to Venuti (see also J. Garms, "Kleine Archivalische Beitrage zu Luigi Vanvitellis Werk," Romische historische Mitteilungen, 17, 1975, 186-187) the marble decoration is by Cerroti and the ornamental metal work by Ricciani. There had been some attempt to give Andrea Pozzo, who designed the architectural setting for the Gonzaga relief on the opposite transept, credit for the design of this relief (the architecture is of course a frank copy of Pozzo's taberacle in the right transept; Garms [as above] quoted Giovanni Bottari, Dialoghi sopra le tre arti del disegno, Florence, 1770, 8 as describing Luigi Vanvitelli's desire to create a new architec- tural design for this altar; the Jesuits held fast to a design identical to Pozzo's). Nibby, 1839, claimed that the relief "fi scolpito da Filippo Valle, spiritoso e franco artefice, sul disegno del ridetto P. Pozzi." Fab- rini, in his study of Sant'Ignazio, accepts Pozzo's authorship of the design. However, the editor of Roma antica e moderna, writing at about the time of the work's completion (1750), stated "il Bassorilievo nell'altare, che rappresenta la Santissima Nunziata e invenzione, e scoltura di Filippo della Valle .. ." As Moschini observes, the notion that Pozzo originated the design probably derives from his Perspectivae Pic- torumatque Architectorum, 1711, part II, fig. 67, in which he suggests a 222</page><page sequence="233">CATALOGUE Plate 64.

According to the description of the illustration, he had actually painted the Annunciation on the wall of the chapel where the relief was later to take its place: "Nella Medesima chiesa di S. Ignazio in Roma io dipinsi questo altare su la muraglia ... Ebbe l'opera si felice successo che gli occhi dei riguardanti rimanevan delusi, stimando vero quel ch'era solo apparente: e se queste regole di prospettiva non avessero altro pregio di questo, pur sarebbono stimabili, potendosi con esse con pochi colori e poca spesa, far comparire opere grandi e maestose, le quali no di rado riescono anche pitu utili, non occu- pando il luogo di altre cose necessarie come fanno le massicce e reali." Although distantly related to the final conception, the illustration by Pozzo had little to recommend it as a preliminary study for della Valle's Annunciation, and no other evidence exists to demonstrate a significant debt owed by della Valle to Pozzo. A commemorative engraving was also made of the relief (cited by Moschini) by A. Faldoni and T. Solari, with the inscription "exculpta opere anaglypho a Philippo de Valle Flrentino anno 1750."

According to d'Armailhacq (1894, 59) the work commenced in 1749 and continued until 1756 at a total cost of 29,237 scudi. However, according to Chracas, the sculpture was completed by 14 October 1752: "... ed in particolare modo vi si osservano nei angoli della cuppola i Dottori di Santa Chiesa, egregiamente lavorati di stucco dal ffi Sig. Maini celebre scultore e dagli'altri tre virtuosi similmente in Scultura Sig. Valle, Monsu Scial e Monsui Gile." Honour notes that the work may have been in place slightly sooner, as Gillet and Challes left Rome in March 1752 (A. de Montaiglon and J. Guiffrey, Correspondance des directeurs de L 'Academie de France a Rome, Paris, 1797, X, 370 and 373). Both Moschini and Honour (although Honour tentatively) ascribe St. Jerome to della Valle. Riccoboni refers simply to a Doctor of the Church. Honour and Fleming (1967, 257) further observe, "The similarity of the four reliefs suggests that they were executed from designs of a single artist, possibly the architect Derizet." All four groupings are similar, although the grouping of the smooth-headed figure of St. Jerome between two angels and beside a lion has a greater compactness and harmony of parts than the other reliefs, thereby suggesting the hand of della Valle. However, until the complete documents are uncovered, the attributions of all the figures must remain tentative.

TERESA First nave pier on right 1754 Marble Plates 71 and 72 We learn from Chracas's Diario ordinario of 24 August 1754 that della Valle's St. Teresa was unveiled at the same time as Pietro Bracci's St. Vincent de Paul on the adjacent pier, giving the public the opportunity to compare the latest works by Rome's two leading scultpors: "Due bellis- sime statue di marmo sono state collocate, ed in questi giomi scoperte nella basilica di S. Pietro in Vaticano, corrispondenti all'altre, che gia da molto tempo vi sono nelle nichie tanto della navata maggiore, che della gran crociata, quali rendono omamento assai nobile a quel maestosissimo sagro Tempio.

(2) Brinckmann (Barock-Bozzetti, 1924, II, 80-81) lists this as a St. Teresa from the school of Bernini, noting its similarity to several of the statues on the balustrade of Berini's colonnade in the Piazza di S. Pietro. Ursula Schlegel argues that the terra-cotta is della Valle's prepara- tory sketch for St. Teresa. The figurine has the rococo sway and S-curve that suggest the eighteenth rather than the seventeenth century. The identification of the figure is provided by the nun's habit, ecstatic attitude, cloud bank, and open book-all possible attributes of St. Teresa. The more static and upright posture of the larger St. Teresa (in St. Peter's) is attributable to its setting in a niche and, perhaps, to the more formal atmosphere of St. Peter's. The two works also differ somewhat in complexity; however, fewer folds and simpler drapery patterns are to be expected in a prelimi- nary sketch. The two putti are similar. Although the putto in the final work does not hold the book, he advances in a similar fashion: his left leg is forward, his right behind, with the foot hidden. In both works the right shoulder of the putto is presented to us directly and the right arm passes diagonally across the body. In the marble the swath of drapery that encircles the putto's hips and covers his nakedness sweeps around from the side opposite to that in the terra-cotta, which is an adjustment that may have been thought necessary to keep this pattern distinct from Tere- sa's garments. The thin ridges of drapery, shallow folds, patterns that turn back on themselves in graceful, undulating S-curves link the terra- cotta of St. Teresa with della Valle's fully-documented terra-cotta relief 236</page><page sequence="247">CATALOGUE of St. John Preaching (Cat.

The standing figure with the flail is shown in both drawings from slightly different angles, suggesting that della Valle and Mengs sat near one another when making the drawings (with Mengs slightly to della Valle's left). Benedict XIV had opened an Accademia del Nudo in 1754, allowing Roman artists the opportunity to make studies from the nude. Della Valle was president of the July session of the Accademia. These drawings were perhaps demonstrations for students (see C. Pietrangeli, "L'Accademica del nudo in Campidoglio," Strenna dei Romanisti, XX (1959), 123-128).

Despite Chracas's clear and factual eyewitness account of the dedication, including the participants and identities of the artists, later writers soon lost sight of which artists were responsible for which works. Titi's guide of 1763, edited by Orlandi-who should have known better (399-400)-drops Luigi Vanvitelli's name as architect and, for the sculptor, names Pietro Bracci. The hochleistung (Ludwig Schudt's term) of Roman guidebooks, Roma antica e moderna, 1765, restored Vanvitelli and della Valle as architect and sculptor. Notwithstanding this correction, the smaller guides that followed, such as those by Vasi (1777,.257) and Venuti (1767, 417) named the artists of the chapel in the same manner as Titi, that is, dropping Vanvitelli and substituting Bracci's name for della Valle's. The authors of these guides were perhaps not aware of the attributions in Roma antica e moderna and, even more likely, had not read Chracas's account. In 1781 Milizia (vol.

XIX), one of Vanvitelli's students. The only nineteenth century guidebook to give a correct attribu- tion of the sculpture was Pistolesi's (1841, 426). Francesco Cancellieri's manuscript, written in 1817 but not published until 1926, quotes Chracas's description of the dedication of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception; but this information was not gleaned by any other twentieth- century writer until the present author's 1975 article in the Burlington (Minor, 1975). Virtually all the published information on Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi and Luigi Vanvitelli has cited Pietro Bracci as the sculptor responsible for the funerary monument. Honour in his entry on Bracci for the Dizionario biografico questioned the attribution on the basis of style. Bracci's authorship gained much of its legitimacy in the twentieth century through its acceptance both by Domarus (1915) and Gradara (1920). Gradara claims this monument for Bracci even though it does not appear in his Diario, a fairly complete reckoning by Bracci of all his commissions through 1762. Gradara lists the Sampaio Monument in an appendix that he claims was prepared by Bracci's son "Pietro, architetto" (Gradara, 1920, 12). This is a curious way of lending validity to a list of works that was drawn, apparently, from the guidebook literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There is no child by this name listed in Gradara's Appendix #5 (112-114); There was a Pietro, perhaps a grandchild of the sculptor, who entered the Accademia di San Luca 12 November 1820, nearly fifty years after the elder Bracci's death (Distribuzione de 'premi ... Accademia di San Luca, 1834, 57). Soon after the publication of Chracas's description by Minor (Burlington, 1975) and Mallory (Bolletino d'arte, 1974 ['76], 176) Jorg Garms (Romische historische Mitteilungen, 1975, 185-192) cited docu- ments from the Biblioteca Corsiniana relative to Vanvitelli's participa- tion in the work at Santo'Antonio dei Portoghesi. The documents date from 8 July 1755 and account for expenses incurred for the chapel; the estimate for della Valle ("non e noto il Patto, ma si crede or pare siano.... ) was 2000 scudi. Gaspare Sibilla was paid 100 scudi and since he too is a sculptor (not a scarpellino) it would suggest that he is respon- sible for the stucco figures (Charity and Purity) above Giacomo Zob- boli's altarpiece of the Immaculate Conception. The figures of Charity and Purity are much in della Valle's style (the fretted, crinkly garment folds, the slightly affected, almost abstract gestures of arched wrists and splayed figners, the ovoid head revolving and tilting on a columnar neck) 243</page><page sequence="254">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY and suggest that Sibilla, if he is responsible for them, was either greatly influenced by the older scultpor or was working from his models. We know from the correspondence in the Corsini papers that there was disagreement about the decoration of the chapel. When the plans became final, and simplified, Vanvitelli may have submitted preliminary designs to della Valle, who then prepared the sculptures. Vanvitelli, who had worked for the Portuguese at San Rocco in Lisbon, planned the extension of the church of Sant'Antonio on its left flank for the purpose of adding the chapel dedicated to the ambassador. Beginning in 1748, Sampaio had been in negotiations with the Agustinians, who owned the property adjacent to the church. It was not until 1754, four years after the death of Sampaio, that work began under the direction of the architect Carlo Morena. There are a group of drawings at the Ashmoleon Museum, Oxford (148.1.N, figures 4-13-which were kindly brought to my atten- tion by John Kenworthy-Browne), from the hand of Joseph Nollekins. Figure 8 seems closely related to the tomb side of the Sampaio Monument. It was probably done by Nollekens during the latter part of his Roman sojourn, that is, toward 1770. The monuments-one with tomb, the other without-to the Commendatore Sampaio face one another on opposite sides of the chapel, constituting a unified funerary conceit. Schiavo ("Luigi Vanvitelli e la Cappella Sampajo," Archivio della societa romana di stora patria, XCV, 1972 ('74), 153) suggests that the two parts of the memorial symbolize the dynamism of life (the trumpeting angel) and the immobility of death (the recumbent putto and listless angel). The medal- lion bearing the inscription "Fide et Consilio" and the winged caduceus, the traditional symbol of a peaceful mission, refer to Sampaio's office as the Portuguese plenipotentiary to the Holy See. Moreover, a caduceus held by joined hands on the reverse of Roman coins suggests peace and concord, notions parallel to Fide and Consilio. A portrait frequently appeared on the obverse of these coins, probably suggesting here the obverse-reverse relationship between the two groups: the contrasts between service and repose, life and death. These pieces fit easily into the corpus of della Valle's work. In particular, the putto beneath the relief portrait of Sampaio closely resembles the putto on the left side of the ur beneath the statue of Temperance in the Corsini Chapel in San Giovanni in Laterano. Each of the winged children is reclining on drapery, with one arm lifted toward his face in a casual gesture. The Corsini putto wipes a tear from his eye. With a similar gesture the putto in the Sampaio monument holds back the 244</page><page sequence="255">CATALOGUE drapery near his face so that he can see the portrait. Both figures are leaning on one elbow and have a leg extended over the edge of the plat- form, each pulling a swath of material with it. Both putti have high fore- heads that extend over the crests of their skulls, indicating an incom- pletely advanced hairline. In each figure the hair is brushed into long, graceful strands and ringlets which seem to emerge imperceptibly from the scalp. The faces of both putti are similar and are characteristic of della Valle's style: where part meets part there is the sense of complete integration and of carefully considered transitions. In both examples the lips are fully modeled with the lower drooping, the upper swollen, as if bee-stung. If one makes a specific comparison between these putti and Bracci's putti on the monument to Maria Clementa Sobieski in St. Peter's one sees that the lips on Bracci's putti are thinner and more severe. The texture of the hair on the putti of the Sobieski monument has not the same quality of fineness as on the putti of the Sampaio monument and on the putto in the Corsini Chapel.

TREVI FOUNTAIN HEALTH AND FERTILITY Lateral figures, first story 1759-1762 Marble Plates 77 and 78 In the fifteenth century, Pope Nicolas V had the main terminus of the ancient Acqua Vergine brought into the Piazza dei Crociferi, near the Fountain of Trevi's present location (Cooke, 1959, 149-173 and D'onofrio, 1962, 225-262, and Pinto, 1984, give the early history of the fountain). Here Leon Battista Alberti designed a simple wall fountain that consisted of a rectangular basin receiving water from three square openings in the side of a building. In the seventeenth-century, Pope Urban VIII commissioned Gianlorenzo Berini to remodel the fountain so that, in all probability, it could stand comparison with the more elabo- rate main outlets of the Acqua Felice and the Acqua Paola. Bernini moved the terminus again, now to its present location, and planned an impressive facade fountain that would be visible from the pope's summer home on the Quirinal Hill. But political difficulties and delays eventually frustrated Bemini's projects, and all that was completed was a semicircu- lar basin, from which the populace could draw water. Then in the second quarter of the eighteenth century, Clement XII Corsini held a competition to select a suitable design for completing the fountain. After some con- fusion, several plans accepted and then rejected, the contract went to Nicola Salvi who began the work in 1732. During the 1730s the surmount- ing papal arms with accompanying ornaments, festoons, and the two flanking allegorical figures of Fame, all by Paolo Benaglia, and the four allegorical figures in the upper register of the projecting fagade (by Bar- tolomeo Pincellotti, Agostino Corsini, Bernardino Ludovisi, and Francesco Queirolo) were completed. The problems that plagued Nicola Salvi and his associate Gio- vanni Battista Maini, the fountain's chief sculptor at this period, revolved particularly around the central figure of Oceanus, the Tritons and marine horses, and probably also around the sculptures for the lateral niches and relief panels (D'Onofrio, 1962, 258, publishes a letter from Salvi that outlines the arguments between Salvi and Maini). Serious disagreements so strained the relationship between Salvi and Maini that work made little progress, and even by 1745 the guide book Roma antica e modema, II, 72, had to use the future tense in describing the aspect of the lateral niches and relief panels: "Nella prima nicchia, delle due collocate di qua, e di la dell'oceano, vi sara la Statua di Agrippa, che con una mano in alto 246</page><page sequence="257">CATALOGUE Plate 77.

Nell'altra banda alla sinistra vi sara situata la Statua della Gia memorata Vergine, che con una mano accennando 1'Acqua, e coll'altra sul petto mostrera in un certo modo di essere essa l'inventrice della medesima. Sopra di lei si vedra l'altro riquadro parimente di basso rilievo, dove saranno scolpiti varj Soldati con la medessima Vergine, che insegna loro la Sorgente." The descriptions of Oceanus, the Tritons, and the sea horses, however, are not in the future tense. This seems to contradict Schiavo, 1956, 135, who writes that in 1745 "la figura principale, quella dell'o- ceano, e le altre due laterali (Agrippa e la Vergine) non occuparono i loro posti .. ." A description identical to that of the 1745 guide appears in the 1750 edition of Roma antica e moderna, II, 252, with the change of all the verbs into the present. D'Onofrio (1962, 269) published the foun- tain's expenses between 1728, and 1747, wherein is found: "A Gio. Bata Maini scultore sc. 2350= pagatili in piiu e diversi tempi nella conformita app.o.... Per tt.1 ii modelli di stucco posti in opera in d.a fontana, sc. 600." Therefore, we have a firm terminus post quem of 1745 and a termi- nus ante quem of 1747 for the placing of the lateral statues of Agrippa and Virgin Trivia and of the reliefs (all in stucco) on the Fountain of Trevi. D'Onofrio (1962, 261) states that in c. 1745 the statues were in wood. He cites Cod. Vaticano 8235 (Doc. XII), which he also repro- duces. Neither in his transcription nor in the document itself have I been able to find any reference to wood; on the other hand, D'Onofrio's document cited above clearly states that the statues on the fountain before 1759 were stucco, and Chracas, 29 May 1762, also confirms the existence of stucco figures before the final work on the fountain was begun (in 1759). The exact appearance of the fountain from the time of Benedict XIV's inscription in 1744 (for the date of the inscription see Chracas, 4th July 1744) to that of Clement XIII's in 1762 has not been a matter of complete agreement among scholars. Specifically, the two stat- ues now seen in the lateral niches are iconographically and formally different from the original models planned and prepared by Maini and Salvi in their uneasy collaboration. The time and manner of this change is in dispute. H. Lester Cooke (p. 167) argues for Maini's authorship of full- scale, stucco models for the figures of Health and Fertility which, he claims, were then copied in marble by Filippo della Valle in 1758, (these figures were replacements for the Agrippa and Virgin Trivia mentioned above and in other early descriptions of the fountain). Cooke suggests that these stucco models were put in place in 1751 (p. 168; where he 248</page><page sequence="259">CATALOGUE 249 w Plate 78. Fertility, 1759-62, marble, Trevi Fountain, Rome.</page><page sequence="260">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY follows the date with a question mark). His analysis of the change from Agrippa and the Virgin Trivia to Health and Fertility bears close scrutiny. Cooke reasons that "possibly the historical figures were preferred by Salvi, since they were important features of his original design, and it was decided to change them only after his death in 1751." Certainly, ample documentation attests to Salvi's insistence upon figures of Agrippa and the Virgin Trivia (because of their association with the origin of the Acqua Vergine) and one can indeed assume that such an alteration of his iconographical scheme would probably not occur in his lifetime. Salvi's conception of the fountain is laid out in "Scritture spet- tanti alla Fontana di Treve'" (Vat.Lat.8235), which contains further evidence that Giuseppe Panini (Salvi's successor), not Salvi, supervised the change of figures. The author of the manuscript, Filarete, quotes verbatim from Salvi's own description of the fountain. Where Salvi discusses the lateral figures of Marcus Agrippa and Virgin Trivia, Filarete adds the footnote "questa statua fu mutata dal nuovo architetto [i.e., Panini] dall Fontana et invece di essa vi fu posta la statua dell'Abondanza" (Doc. XII). Although D'Onofrio reproduces Salvi's description, he leaves out Filarete's footnote, which is of some impor- tance in assessing the changes during the fountain's final phase of construction. In the same vein, Filarete also footnotes Salvi's reference to the Virgin Trivia: "anco questa fu mutata dallo stesso architetto, e vi fu posta la statua della Salubrita" (ibid.; this one was noted by D'Onofrio). Filarete's document, therefore, indicates that were Maini responsible for models of Health and Fertility, he would have executed them after Salvi's death on 9 April 1751. Because Maini died 29 July 1752, he had a scant, although not impossibly short, sixteen-month period in which to construct the models. Cooke's basic defense for this thesis that Maini first modeled the figures of Health and Fertility rests, it seems, on a passage from Giuseppe Vasi's Itinerario istrutativo, 1777: "La statua di mezzo, e il tritono co' cavalli marini sono opere di Pietro Bracci; le due statue laterali di Filippo Valle modelatti prima dal Maini." If Vasi intends this to mean that della Valle copied Maini's figures, then he stands alone among contemporary guides in this assertion. Rossini's II Mercurio Errante, 1760, ascribes the lateral figures to della Valle with no mention of Maini. Filippo Titi, 1763, confirms Rossini, while mentioning that Maini first modeled the central group of Oceanus, the Tritons, and sea horses (note that Vasi does not mention Maini in this association, one that is fully supported by documents). Venuti, 1767, makes attributions completely in accord with Titi's, that is, he mentions Maini's associa- tions with the central group but not with the lateral statues. The 1765 250</page><page sequence="261">CATALOGUE edition of Roma antica e moderna attributes the lateral figures to della Valle and makes no mention of Maini. Vasi himself in the 1765 and 1791 editions identifies della Valle as the author, without mentioning Maini's name. In other words, the inference drawn from the 1777 edition of Vasi finds no corroboration from the literature of the period, not even in Vasi's other editions. Cooke further asserts that Maini "is known to have prepared" small bozzetti for Health and Fertility. His source for this information is ostensibly Card. Baronio (i.e., Roma antica e moderna, 1745, 253-no volume number given; the citation, it seems, should read Roma antica e moderna, 1750, II, 253, but here again there is no confir- mation of his statement). A document in the Archivio di Stato, Rome, (Doc. XIII) is an accounting by Giuseppe Panini in collaboration with Filippo della Valle of the financial obligations of the recently deceased Maini's estate to the Tribunale dell'Acqua Vergine di Trevi. The document indicates what works were in progress at the time of Maini's death. His major task at hand was the cutting of the "statue di marmo della Fontana di Trevi, incominciate dal medesime e lassate imperfette . .." In connection with Maini's final payment of 1,100 scudi (there was a four hundred-scudi restitution) no mention is made of full-scale or modello- sized stucco figures. This adjustment probably considers work by Maini which was executed during a significant part, if not all, of the period from 9th April 1751 (the death of Salvi) to the 29th of July 1752 (Maini's death), the time span to which Cooke must restrict himself for the erection of Maini's stucco figures of Health and Fertility. A passage from the Vatican Library's "Scritture spettanti alla Fontana di Trevi," gives evidence that Nicola Salvi's plans for the Trevi were not altered until after the pontifi- cate of Benedict XIV (who died in 1758): "Benedetto XIV perfezionasse l'omator, nulladimeno o perche aggravare non volesse l'errario con tal spesa, o per altre cagioni; per quello riguarda le statue, li fece rimodellare di stucco, riservando pero in tutto l'idea di Niccola Salvi. Alla fine Clemente XIII chinato dall'esempio di tanti suoi predecessori con animo vivamente grande si accinge al compimento dell'opera, commandando, che di vivo marmo l'oceano, li Tritoni, e Cavalli Marini, in . ..statue laterali, e bassi rilievi si lavorassero,... dagli scalpelli del Bracci nell'o- ceano, Tritoni e Cavalli, e dal Valle nelle due Statue laterali" (Vat. Lat. 8235, n. 69, under the heading "Succinta Storia della origine, e Progresso della Fontana di Trevi"). Apparently, then, the appearance of the sculptural decoration of the Trevi Fountain remained unchanged from 1745/46 until the pontificate of Clement XIII (1758-1769). The archives of the Presidenze degli Acquedotti Urbani, Archivio di Stato, Rome, 251</page><page sequence="262">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY provide numerous mandati and giustificazioni for non-sculptural work on the fountain during the 1750s. Another document (Doc. XIII) gives some indication of one of Panini's major concerns during this period; the need to spend as large a sum as 6,000 scudi for the cleaning and restoration of the fountains, as well as maintenance of the drains. On 14 March 1759, Clement XIII indicated his determination to complete the ornamentation of the Trevi Fountain, "una delle piui cospicue modere fabbriche di questa nostra citta" (the complete payment accounts for the final phase of the fountain's construction are reproduced in Doc. XV). Work began immediately after Clement's declaration. The sculptor Pietro Bracci wrote in his Diario: "Fu principiato il p.mo Aprile 1759 a fare li modelli di greta alti p.mi 4 dentro lo steccato in pera alla Fontana su l'andare di quelli che vi erano di stucco, e poi variati a piacere, in termine ad mesi due cioe all fine di Maggio" (Gradara, 1920, 111). The activity drew the attention of Chracas, who reported on 2 June 1759: "Per ordine della Santita di N. Sig.re sono gia molti giomi, che e dato principio al lavoro delle statue, e bassi rilievi, che dalla magninimita della Sant. Sua vogliono farsi collocare nei siti gia opportunamente disposti fin da quando si fece la fabbrica della nobilissima e veramente magnifica Fontana di Trevi, per maggior oramento della medessima; e li virtuosi scultori di tali opere sono li Signori Pietro Bracci, Filippo Valle, Giovanni Grossi, ed Andrea Bergondi." This passage from Chracas informs us that within months after Clement's directive to the Tesoriere Generale, the four sculptors who were to complete the decoration of the Fountain of Trevi were under contract. According to Doc. XV, Bracci received his first payment ten days after Clement's directive; della Valle received his first payment by 12 December 1759. The giustificazione of 14 July 1762, signed by Clement XIII, describes the fountain as "essendo intieramente compito." A passage from Chracas reports that the work was already completed by 22 May 1762: "In questi giorni passati e stato terminato il lavoro di perfezzionare ne suoi abellimenti, restati fin'ora interrotti dopo essere state costrutta di nuovo, e rimossa della sua anti- chita con la magnificenza, che si vede la famosa fontana di Trevi, opera del celebre Architetto Salvi, poiche essendo mancante di alcune statue, e bassi rilievi postivi per allora in modelli di stucco, vi sono stati adesso messi di marmo, e questi in particolare vengono ad essere la statua, ossia colosso nel prospetto principale di mezzo rappresentatne l'oceano, e li due Cavalli Marini, con li Tritoni reggenti il freno de suddetti, e questi sono opera del Pietro Bracci Romano. "Le due statue nelle nicchie laterali rappresentanti quella a mano destra la Fertilitai, ed'altra alla sinistra la Salubrita sono opere del Sig. 252</page><page sequence="263">CATALOGUE Filippo Valle Fiorentino. II basso rilievo situato a mano destra rappresen- tante Marco Agrippa, che ordina la fabrica degl'Acquedotti e del Sig. Andrea Bergondi Romano e l'altro a mano sinistra rappresentante Trivia in atto d'insegnare alli soldati di detto Marco Agrippa la sorgente dell'Acqua Vergine, e del Sig. Gio. Battista Grossi Romano; tutti virtuosi scultori." However, della Valle's statues were already in place by 1760, when Rossini described them: "In una delle Nicchie laterali, e situata la statua rappresentante la Fecondita, e nell'altro la Statua rappresentante la Salubrita, scolpite da Filippo della Valle Fiorentino." As a related matter, we should also consider Pietro Bracci's debt to Maini, which clearly is heavier. However, here too there is room for disagreement. H. Lester Cooke, in discussing "the extent and nature of the changes which were made by Bracci when he finished the work of Maini in 1762" concludes that "(j)udging from the documentary evidence the changes were slight, and since the graphic evidence does not contro- vert this conclusion in any way, the former should be regarded as the more reliable source of information" (173). A print by Piranesi, which exists in seven states, provides graphic evidence. The first two show Oceanus with arms at his side (this view does not correspond with other views of Oceanus before Bracci's intervention) and also Agrippa and the Virgin Trivia (these were the stucco models prepared by Maini that were later replaced by della Valle). The third (Cooke erroneously states "second") and succeeding states show the fountain much as it appears today. Hind dates the first state 1751 (his catalogue number 19) and comments, "I have been unable to find out whether this shows the statues as they appeared in 1751, or whether Piranesi's design was based on models never carried out, or altered about 1760" (Giovanni Battista Piranesi, London, 1922, 44). Cooke reasons, "As we have pointed out before, the evidence regarding the date when the figures of Agrippa and the Virgin Trivia were changed is so conflicting that no positive conclu- sions can be drawn from either their presence or absence. The importance of this print lies in the fact that the second, third, and fourth states all show the central figure of Oceanus exactly as it appears today and there- fore it seems that Bracci did not alter this figure to any appreciable degree when he finished the work of Maini in 1758-1762" However, if my argument is correct, the third (Cooke is wrong, the figure of Oceanus does not change until the third state, when the lateral statues also change) and succeeding states must date from after 1759 any therefore reflect Bracci's and della Valle's work, not Maini's. Concluding his argument for Bracci's indebtedness to Maini, Cooke writes: "There is also no 253</page><page sequence="264">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY record of new marble having been quarried for the work of Bracci. From this one must conclude that he was obliged to use the stone which had been cut to Maini's specifications, and which had been left unfinished when Maini died in 1752. Any alterations therefore would have had to be made within the narrow limitations of Maini's rough-cut figures" (168). The documentation that I have come up with contradicts Cooke's statement. Francesco Ceroti and Paolo Campi (both scarpellini) were paid in excess of 7,800 scudi for marble for the final sculptural decoration of the fountain. Cooke goes on: "Lastly, it is most improbable that Bracci would have been permitted to alter designs which for twenty-nine years had been the subject of intensive and critical study" (168). But does not the changing of the lateral figures contradict his assumption? We can get a fairly clear idea of the appearance of Oceanus, the sea horses, and Tritons from an anonymous and a signed print in the Biblioteca d'Archeologia e Storia dell 'arte (Collocazione: Roma XI, vol. 12 [Fontane e Acquedotti], prints 15 any 21). Print 15 is signed "Bowles" [in the plate]. I have seen another edition of this print, at a print shop, which is identical in all details, but has, in addition, the date December 1751. Print 21 is unsigned. Of the library's collections of prints and drawings of the Trevi, only these two reproduce both the inscription of Clement XII and Benedict XIV, but not that of Clement XIII, thereby giving us the appearance of the fountain during the period 1744-1762 (or, more specifically, 1745/47-1759). It should be pointed out here also that Vasi's illustration of the fountain, from his Delle magnificenze di Roma antica e moderna, Libro Sesto, Rome, 1756, has only the inscription of Clement XII, and therefore does not really give an accurate description of the fountain in the year of publication. The print by Piranesi, mentioned above, is conceived from such an acute angle that it is of little use in determining the appearance of the fountain at that time. D'Onofrio's discussion of print 21 from the Biblioteca d'Archeologia e Storia dell'arte is indicative of the confusion over the fountain's history between 1744 any 1762. He writes: "Riguardo all'anonima incisione della fontana che ho assegnato al 1745 circa, occorre dire inoltre che essa dovrebbe essere uscita dalla bottega dello stesso Salvi per varie ragioni. Innanzitutto, mancando in essa l'iscrizione di Clemente XIII del 1762 (lungo la base della volta della nicchia), intanto 6 anteriore a questa data. Poi, la presenza della statua di Agrippa a sinistra e dcelle Vergine a destra, oltre alia strada di scogli sotto l'oceano, sono tutti elementi che dicono esser questa incisione precedente alla morte del Salvi (1751). Infine, il prospetto della facciata, a sinistra, si vede che continua nella 254</page><page sequence="265">CATALOGUE medesima struttura architettonica anche lungo il fianco: particolare che non corrisponde alla realta, mentre invece corrisponde al modello in legno della fontana eseguito su istruzioni del Salvi. "Quindi, la nostra incisione fu eseguita tra il 4 luglio 1744 (allorche fu messa l'iscrizzione nell'alto: 'Perfecit Benedictus XIV Pont. Max.' [per la data cfr. il Chracas del 4.VII. 1744] e la morte del Salvi (1751): ma senza dubbio assai piui verso la prima data, quando ancora l'architetto sperava ed era in condizioni fisiche di sistemare le fiancate della fontana secondo il suo progetto originario, cioe con la stessa architettura del prospett. "La fontana fu definitivamente inaugurata la domenica del 22 maggio 1762 (cfr. il Chracas)" (Le Fontane di Roma, 1962, 261). D'Onofrio states that the appearance of the left flank of the facade does not correspond with reality but rather with Salvi's plan, and therefore, in order to be familiar with the plans, the engraver was proba- bly associated with Salvi's shop. However, Panini's painting of the fountain (N. Arisi, Gian Paolo Panini, Piacenza, 1961, cat. 232) contains this same architectural variant. Panini was not associated with Salvi's project. It is apparent that the architectural plans were widely known. Secondly, D'Onofrio wishes to date the print toward 1745 (the relief panels, however, were vacant in that year) when Salvi was still physically active. Yet it should be pointed out against D'Onofrio's contention that, although nearly paralyzed his last few years, Salvi managed to sign giustificazione right up almost to the end (see Archivio di Stato, Presidenza degli Acquedotti Urbani, B. N. 71, passim). We see also that D'Onofrio uses Salvi's death in 1751 as the terminus ante quem for the fountain's state as represented in Print 21. It seems to me that the proper terminus should be 1759. There are two other visual documents for the appearance of the fountain between 1745 to 1747 and 1759: a modello by Gian Paolo Panini in Boston, and a painting by Panini in Saint Petersburg (Arisi, Panini, cat. numbers 231 and 232). Panini's painting and modello, along with the prints, are all in close agreement on the appearance of Oceanus during this period. Oceanus' drapery, where it merges with the shell motif, is considerably more developed in Bracci's version. The left elbow on Bracci's Oceanus appears to project more than Maini's, while the right arm of Bracci's figure is slightly closer to the body than on Maini's. This slight change in the position of the arms affects the balance of the upper torso and tends to give Bracci's figure a greater compactness. Whereas Maini's figure gazes up and to his left, Bracci's looks down and to his right. This attitude of Bracci's Oceanus closes the composition, while 255</page><page sequence="266">PASSIVE TRANQUILLITY Maini's figure leads our eye away, following his gaze, upward and outward. There seems to be greater torque in the turnings of the Oceanus we see today. He also appears to be farther back on his heels, in a strange dance-like pose. Rudolf Wittkower describes "Bracci's slightly frivolous Neptune, standing like a dancing master on an enormous rocaille shell," which, he writes, "is far removed from the spirit of Bemini's works as is the picturesque quality of the many rivulets of the artificial union of formalized basins with natural rock" ( Art and Architecture in Italy, 1580- 1750, 1973, 292). This concetto to which Wittkower refers was in fact created mainly by Bracci and Panini, not Maini and Salvi. The large half shell either did not exist in Maini's version, or existed in a greatly reduced form. Bracci's alterations, then, in the figure of Oceanus, although not considerable, nevertheless changed rather significantly his visual impact. Additionally, the formalized basins were added by Panini, contrary to Salvi's plans. Those very elements, then, that contribute so effectively to the charm and fantasy of the fountain are products of the last phase of the Trevi's construction and are attributable to the architect and sculptors then active (the prints and paintings do not give a sufficiently detailed picture of the relief panels to allow for any specific assessment of the changes made by Bergondi and Grossi. One can see that although the iconography did not change from Maini's stucco reliefs to what we see today, the groupings of figures did). In addition to the documentary evidence telling against Maini's designs for Health and Fertility, the stylistic evidence argues with equal persuasion. The figure of Fertility, in the left niche, has a striking simi- larity with della Valle's Temperance in San Giovanni in Laterano. Other than the differences in the body canons and the more emphatic handling of drapery in the Fertility (which can be accounted for by differences in setting), one figure could nearly be considered a copy of the other. In both figures the hair is parted in the center, sweeps down along the fore- head and temple and back over the ear. The action of drapery as it falls from the left shoulder and down the back, past the hip, and across the front of the body is nearly identical in the two pieces. So too is the contrapposto (although more emphasized in the later statue), the posi- tioning of the head, the bent shoulder, and the arm passing before the body (with the same swath of material encircling the upper arm), as well as the bared left breast. The figure of Health (Salubrity) repeats the drapery patterns, if not the actual pose, of the allegorical figure of Justice on the tomb of Innocent XII in St. Peter's. In a coy, sensuous, and teasing manner, della 256</page><page sequence="267">CATALOGUE 257 Valle contrasts the thin clinging, wet drapery falling in striations from the allegories' breasts with the more massive folds about their hips. The figure in St. Peter's is both more elegant and sinuous, but in its essentials, is closely related to the allegory of Health on the Trevi. This stylistic evidence, then, taken in conjunction with the documentary evidence outlined above, suggests quite clearly that della Valle was not limited in any way by Giovanni Battista Maini's earlier work on the fountain.

MUSEO DI PALAZZO VENEZIA COPY OF FERTILITY Terra-cotta Plate 79 Until recently, this terra-cotta and one of Bracci's Oceanus in the same museum were thought to be bozzetti for the Trevi Fountain. Armando Schiavo was the first to argue that they are reduced copies made in the mid-nineteenth century for a wooden model of the fountain owned by Count Zeloni (plate 80). The terra-cotta of Fertility, then in the collection of the Commendatore Apollini, was exhibited in 1911 at the Castle Sant'Angelo as coming from Salvi's model for the fountain ("Faceva parte del modello suddetto di Salvi"). In 1932, at the exhibition II Settecento Italiano, it was attributed to Pietro Bracci. Hermanin, 1948, Santangelo, 1954, any Honour, 1959, all accepted an attribution to della Valle without question. Schiavo argues along several fronts against Bracci's and della Valle's authorship of these terra-cottas. He points out that Bracci's fairly complete account of his work for the fountain (in his Diario) mentions no modelli or bozzetti. Nor would there have been any need for these, as Bracci was working from Maini's models. Further, Pistolesi's description of Zeloni's model of the fountain (probably identi- cal with the one built by Salvi in 1737, plate 80) indicates that it was made to one-nineteenth scale. Both these statuettes are one-nineteenth of their originals (which of course does not rule out an eighteenth-century provenance, there being no indication that Zeloni altered the dimensions of Salvi's model). That reductions of the Trevi's statues were indeed produced for the Count is substantiated by Pistolesi's pamphlet-descrip- tion of 1855: "Artistico-estetica fu certamente l'idea, e si potrebbe anche dire filantropica, poiche dalla Salviana antica mole non esisteva che la verticale parte muraria o laterizia, per cui lo Zeloni altre raffazzonarla e nelle sue singole parti abbellirla, gli convenne del tutto nel costruire la scogliera, il bacino, o piano acquario, la statua monumentale e le decora- tive, non che stabilire la discessa dell'acqua, la quale per moltissimi emissari si fa strada, e si presenta all'attonito osservatore all foggia di ventaglio, e qua e la zampillando, come si facesse strade fra qualla scabrosa scogliera.... II Nume e l'acqua non sono i soli oggetti che fan parte del monumento, ma bensi nelle laterali nicchie vi si vede la Salubrita e la Fecondita: sublime e nobile allegoria; son del Valle." The wooden model is now in the Museo di Roma and a photograph shows the model and the terra-cottas reunited. A bozzetto, of course, is a prelimi- nary sketch or idea for a statue and is not usually an exact replica of the final work. The terra-cottas in the Museo di Palazzo Venezia are highly 258</page><page sequence="269">CATALOGUE Plate 79.

F. Calvo, "Roma, S. Ignazio," Tesori d'arte cristiana, V: dal Manierismo al novecento, Bologna (1968), 233, attributes the painting to an unknown follower of Maratta. According to P. Natale Fabrini, S.J., La Chiesa di S. Ignazio in Roma, Rome, 1952, 22: "II quadro e attribuito da Antonio Nibby al Fratello Andrea Pozzo, S. J., e dal P. Sante Chiaverelli (gia Prefetto della chiesa) al Fratello Pierre de Lattre, S.J. Non puo essere ne dell'uno, ne dell'altro. Poiche del Regids ffi permesso il culto pubblico solo nel 1716. Ora il Fratello Pozzo mori nel 1709 ed il Fratello de Lattre nel 1683. Conviene dunque dire solo che e un bel quadro del '700, di autore ignoto." G. Martinetti, S. Ignazio, Rome, 1967, 61, essentially agrees with Fabrini. In Roma antica e moderna, vol. I, Rome, 1765, 258, we have the nearest thing to a contemporary account of the painting: "II Quadro del Santo con altre figure, il quale era opera di Alessandro Salini, si lavora di nuova invenzione dal Pozzo." So the tradition of Pozzo is borne out by this guide book's description, while it is clear that the painting was in fact redone by Salini in 1763.
