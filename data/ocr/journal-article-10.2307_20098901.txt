<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. VITKIN THE PROBLEM OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM The concept of 'society' (Gesellschaft) in classical Marxism denotes not any form of human relations; in Marxism only those relations which are characterized by universality are recognized as 'social'. This peculiarity of classical Marxism has influenced its interpretation of contemporary Western society and of world history, and has also affected its prognosis concerning the future 'human society'. In this article the idea of universality of social relations in classical Marxism is examined in relation to two themes: firstly the thesis of classical Marxism about the 'up-side-down' character of contemporary society and, secondly, the dominance of natural relations in all preceding history. These topics deserve careful attention because they are connected in the most intimate manner with the intellectual originality of classical Marxism and its apparent intellectual promises (includ ing some elements which later became burdensome to Marx). When Marx tells us in the 'Theses on Feuerbach' that he is taking the "standpoint of human society",1 the logical stress falls on 'human'. When he published these for the first time in 1888, Engels put this word in italics so as to draw the reader's attention to its importance. The notion of 'man' has a peculiar meaning in classical Marxism, derived partly from a naturalistic anthropologism and partly from Marx's recognition of the anthropological importance of the modern industrial successes of Western Europe. According to Marx, not every member of the human race deserves the title 'man' in the full sense of this word, just as not every human historical community (Gemeinwesen) can be called 'human society'. Like any other living species, man developed - according to Marx - not all at once but as the result of a lengthy natural evolution, developing its natural potencies from generation to generation. In the case of man this process is not yet complete. Although no other human group or region is as close to completion as that of industrialized Western Europe, completion is not yet reached even there. If we are what we are this is because we are well along the path from our animal ancestors to our mature descendants, and this fact is reflected in our civilization. However, real perfection will be reached only by overcoming Studies in Soviet Thought 20 (1979) 243-256. 0039-3797/79/0203-0243 $01.40. Copyright ? 1979 by D.

Only by overcoming them will the human race reach maturity in 'human society', the members of which are people in the full sense of the term. What could be called the 'sociology' of Marx consists in the critical analysis of these objective obstacles to human progress toward full maturity. What could be called Marx's philosophical-historical view is basically his analysis of the coming-to-be of the human race as a whole. Both the sociology and historiosophy of Marx are based, therefore, on the notion of 'human society' and view the problems of contemporary European man as final and as those of all men. Marx begins with the conviction that only his era of European history provides science with the secret of man and 'human society', revealing the veritable content and true direction of the anthropogenetic process. The striking industrial progress of modern Europe shows, to Marx, that man is a sensory-objective-active being, transforming natural forms into forms that meet his needs. It was quite clear to Marx that human activity cannot be reduced merely to work, but the place that work occupied, occupies and can occupy among human vital activities constitutes, according to Marx, a decisive criterion of the maturity of man as an animal species. The whole process of human maturation consists for Marx in replacing the original primitive (barbarian) system of life - within which work is an element which is conditioned by all' the other elements of the system ? with a completely different system, where work becomes the dominant element. This transformation involves getting rid of two types of subjective obstacle: those having to do with need-satisfaction, and those having to do with collective natural forms. From this viewpoint, primitive community is characterized by the fact that in it work is a means of satisfying natural economic needs and a means of achieving natural, extra economic strategies that, in turn, limit work. In mature human activity, on the other hand, work becomes a "goal-in-itself ", i.e., a vital need2 that coin cides with complete satisfaction of the traditional needs and generation of new needs, capacities, etc., as well as with elimination from life of religious, ethnic and other motivations. Marx not only states the typological counterposition of these two struc tures, he also tries to illuminate the process of transition from one to the other and finds the decisive factor to be the introduction into the primitive structure from the outside of other needs and strategic outlooks. It is only</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM 245 this intrusion that liberates work from the structures of traditional needs and from extra-economic control. The more extensive and more stable the inter action of the isolated and autonomous life-worlds becomes, the more intense will be the process of transition from the primary structure to the secondary. The culmination of this process occurs when relations between people become universal; i.e., when the generation and satisfaction of needs becomes world wide and coincides with the emancipation of production from the naturally given subjective limitations. Marx sees the establishment of a universal ex change of products of labour as an indicator of the decisive successes needed by man to achieve maturity as a species.He writes: The fact that this need on the part of one can be satisfied by the product of the other, and vice versa, and that the one is capable of producing the object of the need of the other, and that each confronts the other as owner of the object of the other's need, this proves that each of them reaches beyond his own particular need etc., as a human being, and that they relate to one another as human beings; that their common species-being (Gattungswesen) is acknowledged by all. It does not happen elsewhere - that elephants produce for tigers, or animals for other animals.3 Not only is there man, says Marx; there is also society. Society is, for him, the system of human activities, based on and issuing from the material production of universally developed relations, needs, capacities and productive forces of people. In classical Marxism 'social' is synonymous with 'universal'.4 It is only the universal character of human relations that opens the way to solving human problems. Therefore, it is only in society that collisions in human existence can be avoided ? but not in present-day civilized society; rather in future 'human society'. This historico-typological scheme, understood as the process of man's generation through work, is basic to classical Marxism and underlies both Marx's sociology and his philosophy of history. It permeates Marx's works, both early (since he became interested in economics) and late, although explicit formulation of it varies in various periods of Marx's life. It also contains in latent form the specific 'Marxist' answers to questions that occupy contemporary European culture.5 As of the moment that modern science showed that the physical universe had neither center nor limit and, therefore, that the notion of the privileged position of finite man in the world is doubtful, the question as to man's place in the universe took on great acuity.6 Answers to this question in classical philosophy - in opposition to which Marxism defined itself - contained a</page><page sequence="4">246 M. VITKIN dramatic ambivalence. On the one hand, there was a clear sentiment of a natural, rational ordering of beings, existing independent of man but com mensurate with his most intimate subjectivity, but on the other hand there was fear before the inert things and spontaneous processes ruling nature.7 Marx sensed this ambivalence and recoiled from it, striving for integrity. To achieve this, he affirmed, one must 'jump out' of philosophy to take the viewpoint of the real, natural man. Human problems are practical and not speculative and practice is the sphere of their resolution. Practice constitutes the basis of social life, i.e. of universal human relations. That is why resolution of human problems is achieved not in the physical universe, but in the social universe taken in its relation to the physical universe. Nature to a man is but the matter and means of his work; so that the "celebrated unity of man with nature has always existed in industry".8 The physical universe is just 'the inorganic body' of the social universe, and this fact makes the solution of the most radical problems of human existence possible. The universality of human relations which is achieved in society presupposes the overcoming of subjec tive limitations that nature imposes on production. As a result, production takes the form of production for the sake of production. But production for the sake of production is freedom, consisting in the permanent overcoming of natural necessity; and is creativity, consisting of permanent transcendence of nature and creation of new forms. Social universe thus means a successful resolution of the riddles of human existence. There is only one real obstacle on the path towards final triumph - contemporary civilization. It must yield its place to 'human society'. From the fact that Marx reduced the basic metaphysical problems to problems arising out of immediate human practice one should not conclude that his first concern was the elimination of hunger, poverty, etc. from human life. Marx did, of course, pursue such goals and 'human society' is a satisfied society; but hunger, poverty and other contemporary social problems did not overshadow his effort to solve the liminal problems. Solution to the latter would be, in his eyes, solution to the former. Marx called for a radical reconstruction of our vital activity so that production for the sake of produc tion, creativity and freedom would be its ground. Otherwise, there would be no solutions for economic or ultimate human problems. Without material production affirmed as a goal-in-itself, says Marx, we cannot achieve the productivity that will satisfy material needs and free up the time needed for science and other cultural activities. Marx's 'new people' are satisfied,</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM 247 well-clothed and lodged, not only because they have freed themselves from the pseudoproblems he calls 'metaphysics' but also because they have made their relations universal and consequently know only too well what creative work is and what it means to be free from natural dependencies. Classical Marxism lays great emphasis on the liberation of work from the constraints of need-bound interests and particular controls, thereby eliminating the usual fears, egoism, self-interest, etc. This is clearly expressed in the idea that 'human society' avoids return to "all the old filthy business" because of its universality.9 On the other hand, one of the advantages that Marx saw to his position was that it permitted solution of ultimate problems through daily activity, through work, through 'need and egoism'. The universality of social relations is central to Marx's sociology and phi losophy of history. Marx came to it through his crusade against the traditional way in the solution of human problems, and ended up realizing that these problems would be solved by changing the world, not by coming up with new explanations. The intellectual work that corresponds to the task of changing the world is not explanation but critique, i.e., exposition of the relations of objects to 'human society'. Both Marx's sociology and his philosophy of history are critical. The latter reveals the irrelevancy of the spatial-temporal multiplicity of forms of human groups by elucidating their natural character, and opposes to it a monothetic 'logic of history' where only the development of universal social relations is of relevance. In turn, Marx's sociology shows the irrationality of contemporary society, where universal relations have to appear only as they historically arise, i.e., not directly but indirectly. Simultaneously, it looks to causes and means of changing contemporary society into 'human' society. Both in sociology and in philosophy of history, Marx's stress on universal relations serves to critique the human world and to demonstrate its past and present inferiority. Let us see how Marx carries out his project, beginning with his critique of contemporary society. The universality of relations, so stressed by Marx, was observed by him in the reality of the Europe around him, in progress in industry and in com merce, but this progress was accompanied by an increase in social inequality, in the intensity of social conflicts and in moral decay. Despite its universal grounds, this society is the exact opposite of what Marx intended. Marx sees this association of the universality of social relations with social conflicts as</page><page sequence="6">248 M. VITKIN due to the fact that contemporary social reality is standing on its head: people or subjects have become objects and the objects - i.e., human products ? play the role of subjects. "All our invention and progress seem to result in endowing material forces with intellectual life, and in stultifying human life into a material force".10 According to Marx, things are endowed in our world with anthropomorphic qualities while people are to play the role of executors of the 'relations between things' that are independent of them. This is why the universality of contemporary relations has led not to the transformation of production into an 'end-in-itself, i.e., the all-round development of man, but to the "sacrifice of the human end-in-itself to an entirely external end",11 furthering mass misery and decay. This state of affairs underlies Marx's whole critique of political economy through which he establishes his sociology and philosophy of history. It also underlies Capital, where the essential problem is stated as follows: the univer sal character of work in a society of independent producers ? like contem porary European society - can exist only in the form of abstract universality, i.e., as the expenditure of physiological forces without any concrete objective. Therefore, every elementary unit of contemporary wealth is a product of work, splitting into concrete and abstract, whence it is a unity of use-value and exchange-value, or a commodity. Marx's labor theory of value recounts the adventures of the universal character of work in contemporary society, and opens the way toward an interpretation of contemporary social reality as standing on its head. Facing value, writes Marx, is the problem of objectification, i.e., of ac quiring corporeal autonomy. There is no obvious solution since every product of labor is, in the first instance, a physical thing with certain useful properties. The physical form of the thing is its use-value. Use-value can attain indepen dent existence quite easily, as long as work ceases to be subjective activity and takes the form of material result. Value is another matter. It cannot have an independent existence; it starts its life with a covert, unexpressed existence as an imperceptible property of things; it is the relation between them. In other words, every thing in our world has the immaterial, essential attribute of being related to other things. Value acquires the status which is identical with notions, ideas and other attributes of such a corporeal object as the human brain. Marx comes to the conclusion that value is an ideal property of things. While it has no proper material bearer ? such as language in the case</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM 249 of thought ? it ultimately finds its own ways to express itself symbolically. It fuses with the natural form of some commodity, for instance, gold. Drawing conclusions from this process of symbolization, and analyzing the money form of commodities, Marx writes: The price or money-form of commodities is like their form of value generally, a form quite distinct from their palpable bodily form ; it is, therefore, a purely ideal or mental form. Although invisible, the value of iron, linen and corn has actual existence in these very articles: it is ideally made perceptible by their equality with gold, a relation that, so to say, exists only in their own heads.12 In Marx the social-economic basis of contemporary society is portrayed as possessing a multi-level structure. This structure resembles a chain reaction in the transformation of economic forms. Among these, the value-form is the most abstract, but is also the most universal one. At the surface of society, which is formed by the interactions of the most developed economic forms, the mystification of material wealth receives its utmost expression. Only after we have traced the phantasmagorical transformations that products of contemporary labor undergo can we comprehend the processes taking place in the sphere of our consciousness. The point is that there exist within the sphere of our consciousness such intellectual contents and forms that in no way can be deduced from natural, perceptible properties of the objective world. However, after the supernatural (social) dimension of con temporary reality has been discovered on the side of the objectivations of our labor, the problems of our consciousness lose their mystery. Marx concludes that we are to understand human consciousness by those objectivations that occur outside of our consciousness. Acting in accordance with the fetishistic character of the objective world, we internalize the formations of our objects; we bring into the sphere of our consciousness the objective contents and forms that are created independent of us by our own social interactions. In this Marx sees the clue to the solution of the problems of the contemporary social order. One of the peculiarities of this order is, therefore, the fact that its semiotic space is occupied by the symbolic activity of the products of labor. This explains why in Marx's sociology the linguistic problems are obviously pushed to the periphery. The more our own relations 'speak' the language of fetishes, the less chance people have to comprehend them, the less should the critical sociology be based on what people think and say. This is, says Marx, indeed an irrational, up-side-down reality, in which subjects and objects borrow each other's natural roles.</page><page sequence="8">250 M. VITKIN Marx looks at history through the eyes of a critic who knows that man is an objective and active being that has failed to solve the basic problem through a series of historical formations. Marx looks at history through the eyes of mature 'human society', a notion that governs both his selection and inter pretation of historical materials. History appears as a natural process of the movement of humanity toward 'human society', burdened by particularity and one-sidedness in the place of universality. It is not the universal principle in man that dominates but something particular, limited, etc. Speaking of antiquity, for example, Marx wrote: Do we never find in antiquity an inquiry into which form of landed property etc. is the most productive, creates the greatest wealth? Wealth does not appear as the aim of production, although Cato may well investigate which manner of cultivating a field brings the greatest rewards, and Brutus may even lend out his money at the best rates of interest. The question is always which mode of property creates the best citizens.13 The prevalence of particular and local extra-economic relations over much of history can be explained mainly by the fact that man is naturally a 'herd animal' (he has in mind the tribal and clan structures of early humanity).14 Since this gregariousness has taken various forms over history, its fundamental character lies concealed in such structures as Eastern despotism, antiquity, European feudalism etc. In sum, the dominance of nature lasted, in Marx's view, until the establishment of European industrial capitalism: "In all forms where landed property rules, the natural relation is still predominant. In those where capital rules, the social, historically created element".15 Despite the fact that the idea of the natural character of pre-capitalist history could cause puzzling questions for some modern readers, this idea has for Marx funda mental significance. First, for him it is the way of demonstrating the deep typological gulf which lies between the contemporary and the preceding epochs. In the latter there is a dominance of the non-economic 'personal interrelations'; in the former there is a dominance of the economic 'thing relations'; in the latter - prevalence of the traditional form of labor which produces use-values within local communities (Gemeinwesen)', in the former ? dominance of labor which is directed towards satisfaction of needs of individuals by means of exchange which overcomes the local limitations; in the latter - an isolated local existence of communities; in the former - universal world-wide historical existence of individuals, etc. But Marx not only analyzes the typological differences as such; he is more preoccupied with</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM 251 the significance of those differences from the point of view of his critical strategy, with all their ensuing consequences for his theory. The importance of these differences, according to Marx consists in the fact that they reveal where, when, and how the process of the real begetting of man through human labor starts. Naturally given abstract possibilities of this process begin to turn into reality mostly in Europe, especially contemporary Europe; by means of the practical formation of universal human relations which in due course conquer the world (world-market). If, indeed, a man is a self-creating object ? an active being ? then the human species empirically forms only as a result of human sensuous activity which overcomes naturally given local limitations and spreads itself out to universality. Defining the practical-universal activity as social and emphasizing its relatively late origin, Marx thus describes the fundamental typological differences of history in terms of 'nature' and 'society'. The conclusion from the above, for the critical theory, is that the only adequate definition of the human species is one which shows the way of its practical creation, and only this definition is true since it is programmed by universal practice. The definition of the human species is achieved not by way of abstracting its trans-historical features, but rather by way of showing the mode of its practical realization. The standpoint of the human species can be comprehended only by critiquing the empirically existing and universally developed practice of contemporary mankind. The consistency with which Marx insists ? in the Grundrisse, in Capital and elsewhere ? on the natural character of all pre-capitalist history is directly due to this fundamental Marxian orientation. Only under capitalism does man break this human gregariousness and liberate production from subjective natural impediments. Freed from the subjective impediments, production goes on to overcome the objective obstacles and man surrounds himself with wealth, the mother of which is objective nature, the father being work. The more human man becomes, i.e., the more social and universal, the more nature turns to him its cultured side. Social man lives in socialized nature because he has freed himself from naturalized history. We should take pains here to correct a basic and widespread misunder standing. Marx links the emergence of society with the development of work. Therefore, it would seem that, for Marx, society can be taken as given along with work. Since, further, work is ? in Marx's own words ? an eternally given condition of human existence, independent of all social forms, it would seem that for classical Marxism man "from the very beginning", i.e., from the</page><page sequence="10">252 M. VITKIN moment of the emergence of work, is living in society. Although those who hold this view stress that early societal forms saw the dominance of natural relations, they think that they follow full in Marx's steps when they use the universal presence of work as a ground for saying that history is social through and through. This view is very widespread.16 However, while Marx sees work as of equal age with man, he sees it as much older than society. Some time passed before work began to emerge from an immediately natural stage (from early gregariousness) and to lead to the emergence of society. In other words, work that leads to the founding of society is, for Marx, ambivalent - being both abstract and concrete. There fore, society emerges in the form of 'civilization' which Marx defines as a society of production and exchange of commodities. The culmination of civilization is modern bourgeois society and, since commodity production is older than capitalism, Marx interprets a certain portion of pre-bourgeois history as an inconsistent amalgam of natural and social relations, constantly stressing the dominance of natural relations in the pre-capitalist era of civiliza tion. During the writing of Capital, Marx thought that the generation of civilization in the form of intercommunal commodity exchange coincides with the consolidation of agricultural production; so he called agricultural groups 'societies' having in mind the distortional effect of civilization on the still dominating natural relations.17 Pre-agricultural communities were for him absolutely natural. In his critique of history Marx was thus showing its natural character. The same critical goal can be observed in his portrayal of the social side of history, since when he was writing his basic economic works Marx resolutely refused to call 'social' any historical forms other than the civilized ones, and civiliza tion ? as Marx tries to prove through his analysis of commodity production ? sets the human world upside-down. It is important to remember that Marx views history in terms of multi directional processes. The emergence of commodity production and exchange is only one instance, but, all other processes remain within the limits of the primitive collectivity and its historical modifications. Only commodity pro duction makes possible the dominance of the universal over the particular and the elevation of social relations over natural relations. Since, according to Marx, historical research seeks its critical objective on two planes (demonstration of the dominance of natural relations over social relations, on the one hand, and analysis of the emergence, nature and</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM 253 tendencies of social processes, on the other) as a historian he used two different methods of research ? the historical and the logical. In the first instance, Marx tried to sketch a general picture of history as a whole and to analyze it from the viewpoint of the correlation of the natural and social principles. In the second instance, Marx invokes historical material in an effort to evoke from it that which is universal in it. In both cases, analytical completeness is strictly dependent on critical thoroughness. Pushed to an extreme, this procedure would provide a 'logical' image of history, where his tory would, in Engels' words, "be free of historical forms and of all chance".18 The retrospectively selective bias of Marx's 'logical' reduction of history can be seen in his periodization: In broad outlines Asiatic, ancient, feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production .... This social formation brings, therefore, the prehistory of human society to a close.19 How does history look in this presentation of 1859? First of all, this schema does not pretend to present history in all its full ness. It aims only to show one ? quite tardy, in Marx's eyes ? developmental line of history,i.e., the social. It, therefore, completely ignores pre-agricultural history, i.e., of barbarians and savages who do not know commodity produc tion and exchange. "Mere hunting and fishing peoples lie outside the point where real development begins"20 (in earlier historical schemata - e.g., in the Manifesto, in Wage-Labor and Capital - at the limits of 'real development' refers to agricultural populations of the East: the notion of 'Asiatic mode of production' first appears in Marx's periodizations of civilization in 1859). Further, throughout subsequent pre-capitalist history those relations, which in reality (and in Marx's interpretation) dominated and which consti tuted the specific trait of various historical eras and conditioned production thereof, are taken into account only as not-yet-overcome forces of nature. It is precisely these that keep production from being itself, that delay its development, and that contribute to the formation of discrete 'means of production'. This is why, after the primitive epoch, the schema deliberately ignores the extra-economic strata. Cleansed in this way, history appears in Marx's presentation as a single 'large' social-economic formation, but, the aroma of history is not fully absent from this schema. While there is not even a hint of the existence of the primitive left, the presence of the extra-economic</page><page sequence="12">254 M. VITKIN layers of subsequent history is contained in the interstices of the schema, since it points out the historical character of production and therefore implies that new productive forces "do not develop out of nothing, nor drop from the sky, nor from the womb of self-positing idea".21 Finally, reduced to a single social-economic formation, history is only the 'pre-history of human society'. That is all that remains of history if we approach it critically, in order to dig out what is relevant to the solution of ultimate human problems. This 'pre-history of human society' is only a frag ment and is irrational in its very essence. Historical critique, done historically or logically, means for Marx affirma tion of one central idea: genuine historical development has not yet begun; it will begin with 'human society'. Human society is history itself just as it is universe itself. If one does not take into account the two levels of Marx's historical analysis, then all sorts of misunderstandings can arise. Let us finish with two instances. George Luk?cs asserted that there is no place for a logical method in Marx ism and that Engels mistakenly attributed one to Marx. History is viewed as the perfection of logic by Hegel, writes Luk?cs, and "for Marx the historical is an irreducible property of moving matter, in particular when, as in this case, it is a matter solely of social being".22 As a matter of fact, however, Marx did not see in history 'exclusively social being' as does G. Luk?cs, in whose works society is viewed as historical 'totality'.23 For Marx to the con trary, history is to the highest degree natural, and social relations are of very minor historical extent. To explain the logic of history means for Marx to explain its universal, i.e., social aspect, or to reduce history to only one of its aspects. This is the reduction of one historical factor to another his torical factor and not the reduction of the historical to something transcend ing history ? against which Luk?cs fulminates. We have already examined one of the examples that show what such history is from the viewpoint of Marx's logical approach, but in the schema of history which we analyzed above there were still some 'historical forms', though only in oblique form. In its most consistent form, Marx's notion of history 'freed from historical forms' appears on those pages of Capital where Marx analyzes the develop ment of the form of value. This is called Marx's logic of history and is, at the same time an analysis of the elementary level of relations of production in contemporary society. Engels quite correctly wrote that Marx's logical</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL RELATIONS IN CLASSICAL MARXISM 255 method begins where the critique of political economy begins - with analysis of the commodity.24 On the other hand, there are cases where the use of logical method by Marx is not denied but perceived as a manifestation of weakness and imper fection, which Marxism has overcome with time. For instance, A. Schmidt thinks that when Marx was confronted with "an immense mass of socio historical material", he, "felt compelled to a large extent to leave aside his historico-philosophical principle of construction, and deviated far from his programme claims", since the "real course of history is much more com plicated" than the picture Marx presented in 1859.25 It seems, however, that Marx realized fully the actual complexity of history. The problem is else where. What Schmidt calls 'real course of history' appears in Marx's writings as a history in all its fullness. Marx insisted that this history is largely under the dominance of nature-relations. What Schmidt calls Marx's 'principles', 'programme claims', is nothing else but the logic of history, its universal, social side. That is why the transition from 'principles' to the 'real course of history', i.e., the transition from the social side of history to its natural side, is accompanied in Marx by a retreat from principles, as A. Schmidt rightly noted. Principles are not meant to work for the material to which they do not apply. But it would be unjustified to interpret Marx's use of two methods as a renouncement of one in favour of the other. Marx did not renounce the logical method in favour of the historical, he simply does not use the logical method when proving the dominance of nature in history. As we have seen, peaceful co-existence of both methods, the thought-out division of labor between them, which does not deny the privileges of the logical method, is quite a consistent expression of the strategy of classical Marxism which is based on the concept of 'human society'. Within the limits of this presentation in article form, we have tried to analyse the universality of social relations as it appears in classical Marxism's social theory. Called into being by Marx's search for meaning, this key idea desig nates a total critique of the human world, both historical and contemporary, in the name of solving all human problems within the social universe. It is a central notion in classical Marxism. Without it, it would not only cease to be 'classical' but it would fall into its constituent parts which would then be only accidentally related. In fact, this very idea, i.e., the universality of social relations, has been undergoing the most severe test of time ? a test that had</page><page sequence="14">256 M. VITKIN begun during Marx's lifetime. It is true that Marx later felt the need to make certain revisions in his views but this can be taken up on another occasion.
