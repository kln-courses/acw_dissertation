<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Destiny of Reason and the Paradox of the/ Sacred /by FRANCO FERRAROTTI /_ IVI Odern societies which wish to be considered technically advanced and socially "developed" define themselves in terms of rational calculation. In other words, we are dealing with societies which rely on being able to control their own evolu- tionary advancement and to express from within those values, that is, the limiting concepts and evaluative criteria, with which to measure their own specific situation in a given historical instance. In these societies, reason no longer has a "destiny" but becomes a self-imposed, historical undertaking. Thus, in the first place, it is an instrument for the exploitation of nature and of man, through whose subordinate labor nature itself is exploited. However, it is at the same time also a self-justifying calcula- tion, and one which grounds the renewal of social consensus. What is, and what has value, is rational; the irrational and the antirational are the unforeseeable, the incongruous, the deviant - in a word, evil. In this sense, reason is transposed from conventional wisdom to scientific argument. From the seventeenth century, and more explicitly in the eighteenth, it confirmed the superiority of Western European man and provided the justification - at once philosophical, political, and theological - of the ventures and genocide undertaken by Eurocentered colonialism. It is no accident that the arrogance of modern man, in its Western European version, shines more brightly when talking of rationality.</page><page sequence="2">THE DESTINY OF REASON 649 In the context of the Enlightenment and the particular "romanticism of science" which is the emotive basis of scien- tism and which has been termed "the tyranny of progress," rationality has traditionally been seen as a qualitative break, a censorship of the irrational and the prerational. Later, in the historicist explanation of historical development, with its char- acteristic required, diachronic optimism, for which human evolution takes on the external, presumed characteristics of chronological inevitability, rationality is equivalent to history itself and is confused with the essence of man insofar as it becomes his fulfillment and is the supreme guarantee of the only possible human significance. An indubitable element of exorcism must be noted in the anxious concern whereby, from the eighteenth century on, an attempt has been made to circumscribe and exclude the irra- tional. Reason is proclaimed as "the religion of precision," the movement from the major oral, qualitative traditions to cold, quantitative precision in numbers and the written word. From Vico's "discovery of the true Homer" to Enlightenment raison and the mathematical intellectualism of Descartes we continue to move on to the "Gutenberg galaxy" and the generalized organization of registrars' offices. Alongside the progress of reason, banning, forcible internment, and social exclusion have also moved forward. This element of exorcism must not be forgotten. It helps us understand how the proclamation of the rational necessarily returns to interdictions of irrational and metarational origin. The irrational cannot be dominated by the rational alone, and the latter cannot even be defined without the former. In modern, technically developed societies, the prerational and irrational have taken on the characteristics of a decline, the sense of regression to a morbid condition. From this per- spective too one should probably revise what is called "irra- tional." In reality, "The value of all morbid states lies in their manifestation, through the magnifying glass, of certain nor- mal states which, however, in their normal condition are not</page><page sequence="3">650 SOCIAL RESEARCH quite visible."1 There are, additionally, good reasons for holding that the categories of "rational" and "irrational" should not be seen as the opposite terms of an irreconcilable dichotomy, but rather make up a polarity, a permanent ten- sion between two linguistic codes and two attitudes to exist- ence which fight and refer to each other. However, even before this, the basic question must be put: Can a society live and perpetuate itself without a "privileged connection" (metautilitarian) which is "sacred"? Can a society survive whose moment of aggregation - that is, of human in- teraction and the participation of the human in the human - ends with a commercial transaction in a market seen and experienced as an impersonal mechanism? On the other hand, can a society produce on its own such a connection - that is, without seeking outside itself and its immanence, how can it lay claim to the logic of "scientific society"? The Fallacy of Dichotomous Reasoning The (qualitative) radical opposition between rational and irrational may be useful, and thus justified, in didactic, illus- trative terms, but it seems to have no possibility of a properly theoretical basis, that is, as regards specific contents. As soon as a given content is proposed as "rational" as against, or above, others, it inevitably becomes frozen into dogma and acts as a veto to other contents, which in turn are presented as erroneous or irrational. Instrumentalization is then clear, and dichotomous reasoning celebrates its victories. Though stimulating by way of its binary, black-and-white schematism, dichotomous reasoning really grossly and improperly simplifies complex problems. On the one hand, it constructs the myth, the monster, of a constructive, dominant rationality, which controls and plans everything. On the other hand, it 1 Friedrich Nietzsche, Frammenti postumi (Milan: Adelphi, 1974), p. 41.</page><page sequence="4">THE DESTINY OF REASON 651 paints a gloomy picture of an instinctive irrationalism, unpre- dictable in its practical behavior, at once violent and mystical, linked with the darkness of mysterious origins lost in the night of time. Historical experience emerges impoverished from this, and also denied its truly human aspect, which is unpredictable and dramatic. Anyone who tries not to hypostatize existing reality to the point of setting up impassable Pillars of Hercules must leave behind the rational-irrational dichotomy and limit him- self to talking of the rational and the "other." Dichotomous reasoning is in this sense not merely a simplification. It is the language of knowledge-as-power, or technical knowledge translated into political superiority, into the structure and jus- tification of domination. The framework of historiographie interpretation popularized by historicism, with its stages neatly laid out one above another, like so many steps of the progress of rationality in the world, has consolidated the Eurocentric dominance over the "other" world, transforming an historical culture, the West European, into culture par excellence, with a timeless, metahistorical value, as a normative term and as an ideal reference point for all other cultures seen only as primi- tive, as noncultures, precultures, erroneous or, at worst, il- legitimate cultures. Thus dichotomous reasoning draws together and perfects the logic of exclusion based on a mythical scientific objectivity and on the systemic system presented as expression of the authority of reason, as the monument reason sets up to itself, narcissistically mirroring itself and thus confirming its own dominance. The cost of this dominance, cognitively as well as socially and politically, is extremely high; it refers to the En- lightenment illusion of rationality as both won by, and an attribute of, the individual, solipsistically - the individual, that is, as one counterposed to, and rejecting, tradition and com- munity. The path of the Enlightenment critique of tradition toward reason as the radical, selective criterion, which can perceive in</page><page sequence="5">652 SOCIAL RESEARCH the past nothing but residual survivals of an animistic and anthropomorphic kind, is long and difficult. It involves inter- mediate stages from Newton's conception of God as Pantoc- rator, God-architect and guarantor of the order of the world, manus emandratix, regulating and guaranteeing as regards the chaos of pure multiplicity, to Voltaire's God as a socially useful function,2 and finally arrives at the "death of God" in d'Hol- bach's Système and the encyclopedic reason of Diderot. At the end of this itinerary, with all the different emphases of the various worlds of thought of Newton and Laplace, or Voltaire and Buffon, or d'Holbach and Diderot, a positive correlation seemed to have been established between withdrawal from, or at least the lessening and exhaustion of, theological studies and the progress of knowledge and scientific discoveries. In this intellectual context, the assumption is that denial of God and absence of interest in theology are preconditions for the conquest of natural rights, or "free thought" and reason, finally liberated from all transcendent religious principles, and thus smoothing the way for the development of the sciences, which in turn will make possible the realization of the bonheur, or the "happiness" of humanity. This happiness, moreover, then grows from the private aim of personal moral perfection into à public goal, the justifying aim of a collective political project.3 The contradiction between the concept of rationality 2 Cf. the famous passage in Voltaire's letter to Louis François Armand Du Plessis, duc de Richelieu, Nov. I, 1770: "Besides, I think it is always very useful to uphold the doctrine of the existence of a rewarding and avenging God: society needs such an opinion. ... If God did not exist it would be necessary to invent Him" {Voltaire's Correspondence, edited by Theodore Besterman [Geneva: Institut et Musée Voltaire, 1962], 77: 62). 3 Much earlier and more violently that in the case of Marx and Engels, religion as a totality of traditional beliefs and practices suffered a fundamental attack from d'Holbach: "Many unprincipled men have attacked religion because it showed itself contrary to their inclinations; many wise men have despised it because it seemed to them ridiculous; many considered it as of no account because they did not understand its true dangers: as a citizen I attack it because it seems to me dangerous for the happiness of the State, an enemy of the progress of the human spirit, opposed to healthy morality, from which the interests of politics can never be separated" {Le Christianisme dévoilé [London, 1766], p. xxi).</page><page sequence="6">THE DESTINY OF REASON 653 as the personal attribute of the individual who frees himself from the "idiocy" of the traditional, communitarian past, and the concept of rationality implicit in the political plans for the bonheur of humanity, is clear and is at the root of the crisis of the individual, whom the Enlightenment had considered au- tonomous and sovereignly self-sufficient. Rationality deserted the individual, leaving him prey to frustrating alienation and recurrent depression, to become the functional characteristic of the great, impersonal bureaucratic organization on which, as on its basic pivot, the rational system of the modern world is poised. "Social physics" and "social engineering" take their assumptions from this. The shadow of Auguste Comte and his "Catholicism without Christianity" is discernible on the horizon. The "instrumental reason," which in today's era of late capitalism was to find in Max Hork- heimer its alert and relentless critic, was ready to enter soci- ety and give the coup de grace to the enchanted world of the great traditions in the name of the comfort and welfare of the masses. Only those realities which could give an account of themselves in terms of rational calculation, in the sense of utilitarian calculation, seemed acceptable and rational. The rest is passe, archaic, irrational and a hindrance to the "prog- ress" of humanity. In a word, it lies outside the "system." Thus the system is also, if not indeed mainly, a place of power, that territory marked out, protected, and armed logi- cally (logistically) against the "barbarians" besieging it. Dichotomous reasoning is a technique of power founded logi- cally (logistically) on the deliberate reduction of lived experi- ence, for a double purpose. First, there is the defense, justifi- cation, and consecration of the existing situation, which is susceptible to improvement but not transcendence - technical improvement against metaphysical transcendence - of what one already knows rationally and which is possessed by means of knowledge. Second, there is an attack, an active battle, against the still undetermined capacities for the development</page><page sequence="7">654 SOCIAL RESEARCH of human beings, capacities which are exorcised and forever ostracized as "irrational." The system can thus also be described by analogy as a case of undue restriction of intellectual commerce for the purpose of setting up forms of parasitic intellectual income. That is the way dichotomous reasoning artificially limits spiritual poten- tiality with the aim of putting it in the service of the "evil dwarfs" who, according to Nietzsche, were the priests, joined, however, by the academics who, as "clerics who have lost their faith," nonetheless do not give up living by (off) ideas instead of for ideas. They show the characteristic avarice of the mid- dle strata, able only to calculate, the strata of savers par excel- lence, but with a shopkeeper's mentality, incapable of squan- dering because they are now incapable of love, or incapable of irrationalism in search of a deeper rationalism, blind in face of the unheard-of and scandalous fact that scientific-utilitarian knowledge may not exhaust all possible knowledge. Such an admission would shake the system as power- structure to its foundations. The leadership never has an interest in development. Power needs solitude, and feels good only in deserts. Smoke on the horizon can be the sign of an enemy approaching, a danger. A meeting with the "other" is always a threat because of the uncertainty of the outcome. For this tactical reason the "other" is always initially denied, "erased." This "erasure," however, is also a self-mutilation, and a beginning of a possibly unstoppable process of the loss of problematic knowledge, to which our age has already fallen vic- tim. Deficiencies in the Concept of "Secularization" The prevailing conceptual system based on the binary logic of dichotomous reasoning, with its related concepts of operative rationality and science as coordinated whole of practically effective knowledge, seems endowed with extraordinary strength. It</page><page sequence="8">THE DESTINY OF REASON 655 dominates "things." It influences reality. Really, it is weak. Its strength is linked to a refusal. Instrumental thought is power- ful, but only because it has rejected the essential unpredicta- bility which defines human thinking at its height, and has subordinated its development to those functional needs al- ready definable up till now in terms of the requirements of the existing social system. It has thus rejected the exploration of the dialectical tension between "function" and "functionality." Value is reduced and enclosed in what is already given. What exists is presented as a nee plus ultra because it is the same as what must be. The teleological dimension has been lost. The social function of utopia has been weakened and ultimately disappeared. Thought loses its involuntary char- acter, similar to play, in order to exert itself in the planned effort of the task at hand. Rational thought in the full sense, that which does not accept what exists as the only possibility and sees in mystery more than shadow - the promise, that is, of a broader range of consciousness - seems weak; so much so that the "strong characters" can mistake it for irresponsible leisurely activity, or "idle curiosity," to use Thorstein Veblen's formula. This basic point was grasped with great clarity by Karl Jas- pers: endental thought seems to be marked by a kind of power lessness. First of all, it is powerless in that it wants to think the unthinkable: it seems in fact to want completely to destroy itself in this way. It is further powerless when it encloses transcendent content in an inadequate objectification and then believes itself able to use this in reasoning and reduce it to something technically precise. In this muddle it suffers the disastrous consequences of an inversion trying to use what is powerless as a power in the sense of a universal knowledge. However, notwithstanding its powerlessness, this thought be- longs to that inner strength of man which silently creates and transforms truth, a strength which cannot be turned to par- ticular ends. This thought, transcendent and universal in the</page><page sequence="9">656 SOCIAL RESEARCH absolute sense, is the only one that can be said to include everything which exists for us.4 The rational-irrational dichotomy, insofar as it is adopted as a system and set up as a rationalization of what exists, is consequently a decisive element in the improverishment of peoples' humanity. In fact, it amounts to a logically codified separation/rom reality as the open, unfenced terrain of human endeavor, where the outcome is not foreseeable. This is the endeavor of a being, man, of whom it can be said only that he is something not precisely definable, that he does not have a nature in the dogmatic, fixed sense, but history in the nonhistoricist sense. He has his broad historical existence, so that even when by chance he yields to the irrational, the antirational, and the suprarational, he can always explain, or at least perceive, be aware of, this yielding, and thus preserve a ray of rationality, even in his most radical opposition to reason. The dichotomous split between rational and irrational finds an historical and immediate parallel in the Christian dualism between reason and faith, though this split as such was un- known to the Greeks. They, however, did acknowledge fate, blind ananke, more powerful than Zeus himself, a sure limit, even though a mysterious one, to all power and all knowledge. Socrates listened to the voice of his inner daimon, which inci- dentally could give only negative advice, concerning what not to do or to avoid. In Plato, for example in Diotima's argument, in the Symposium, the madman, "possessed by the god," tran- scends and goes beyond the limits of rationality. For the realist Aristotle too there were forms of consciousness going beyond and also against prescribed knowledge based on deductive reasoning and observation carried out according to predeter- mined logical norms. Until the period of modern critical phi- losophy in Western Europe, the philosophical tradition has always preserved the sense of mystery, in various ways and 4 Karl Jaspers, Vernunft und Existenz (It. trans., Turin, 1971), pp. 124-135; emphasis in original.</page><page sequence="10">THE DESTINY OF REASON 657 from different viewpoints - the sense, that is, of a twilight zone still to be explored but not thereby to be erased as "irrational" or "antirational."5 It is to Max Weber that we owe the deepest and altogether most original reflections on this process of banning mystery, which he pointed to as a process of "rationalization" typical of the West. This is pushed as far as radical criticism and reaches a contradictory outcome - experienced by Weber as a personal trauma - of the highest exaltation of reason and thence to inevitable disappointment regarding its effective capacities in the conduct of life. Resistance to this process of "rationalizing" social life, "corticalizing" human experience, and "seculariz- ing" social relations in general has been stubborn, and in the light of the empirical findings in the research published here cannot be said to have been completely beaten. The names of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are enough to raise valuable doubts. However, Weber went on, with the typical assurance of the "witnesses of the crisis," to document the stages of the rationalization of life in the West, in an intellectual climate also shared by many of his contemporaries, from George Simmel to Oswald Spengler. For us today so openly Eurocentric an emphasis is more a matter of pity than scandal, but Weber asked himself by what combination of circumstances, by what interplay of economic data, historical traditions, value structures, and ethical and psychological ten- dencies had it happened that in fact only in the West should human sociality, Kultur, have produced phenomena estab- lished and imposed according to a process of development of universal value and meaning. Max Weber's merits as regards the development of the so- cial sciences are many, and this is not the place to rehearse 5 It is sufficient to cite, as representative of different spheres of thought that converge on this point, Carlo Antoni, La lotta contro la ragione (Florence: Sansoni, 1942), and Robert A. Nisbet, The Quest for Community (New York: Oxford, 1953). Regarding the latter, see my essay "La 'ricerca della communità' in R. A. Nisbet," in my La sociologia come partecipazione e altri saggi (Turin: Taylor, 1961), pp. 62-75.</page><page sequence="11">658 SOCIAL RESEARCH them. It is enough to remember that it is to Weber that we owe the destruction of rigid conceptual oppositions, typical of dichotomous reasoning and so common in the history of the social sciences: tradition versus reason, structure versus super- structure, environment versus personality, culture versus cus- tom, society versus community, and so on. I have dealt with this at length elsewhere.6 It is not, however, difficult to per- ceive the limitations and internal contradictions of his argu- ment on "secularization." According to Weber, the mysticoreligious impulse, especially strong in the Protestant world, was transformed, "secularized," in everyday economic practice. This last was organized and continuous through time, scanned according to the regular rhythm of the methodical life of the good functionary who can keep ledgers in order and who sees in the prosperity of mun- dane matters a sure sign of predestination and eternal salva- tion. In this way, according to Weber, the sense of religious experience, or of the "sacred," diminishes, is exhausted, and ceases. In its stead there flourishes and triumphs the pro- ductivistic logic of industrial society, rationally planned and technically advanced. The argument is attractive, but the facts give it the lie. It is not only a question of Robert K. Merton's observations con- cerning the exponential growth of the bureaucratic organiza- tion in Weber's theory, which do not go much beyond a simple intellectual projection or unwarranted extrapolation. Bureau- cracy does not necessarily mean rationality nor even formality. Merton questions Weber's general thesis at several points, il- luminating and empirically demonstrating the existence of irrational dysfunctions present and even caused by certain bureaucractic structures, along with the self-destructive nature of excessive concentration and rational integration, in a formal 6 I have written much on Max Weber and should like to recall here: Max Weber e il destino della ragione (Bari: Laterza, 1965); Trattato di sociologica (Turin: Unione tipog- rafico, 1968), esp. pp. 140-182; Max Weber (Milan: Academia, 1972); and my intro- duction to the Italian edition of Weber's Sociology of Religion (Turin, 1976).</page><page sequence="12">THE DESTINY OF REASON 659 sense. Other critical observations could be usefully added re- garding the passage, typical in mature capitalism, from a cen- tralized, legalistic bureaucracy to dynamic, functional bureaucracies, with a modular structure, able to adapt them- selves fully to specific tasks. The important question lies elsewhere. The tendency to universal bureaucratization, which to Weber is transideological and thus concerns both capitalism and socialism, involves the triumph of the impersonal rule and the "disenchanting of the world" (Entzauberung). Weber is genuinely tormented by this. In a bureaucratized world, one reduced to pure instrumental- ity, what will happen to the "realm of ends"? Who will take the major decisions? To whom will values be entrusted? Will there then still be values to preserve and to defend? In these very limitations of Weber I see the reasons for his lasting relevance. Industrial society is a society organized in a bureaucratic manner, all-inclusive, gregarious and calculating, which spreads out horizontally, with a monotonous absence of depth. It is a "disenchanted" society, based on a lay faith in the "omnicalculability" of experience, tending to be desiccated and intellectualistic, in which death itself is no longer the crown- ing, the consummation of a life, but a pure and simple inter- ruption of a process of knowledge and experience in itself indefinite - a banal accident. One dies, says Weber, tired of life and never satisfied by it, as Abraham, on the other hand, could be. The picture is a fascinating one, but the witness present at the European crisis between the wars here took over from the rigorous analyst who requires empirical "guarantees" from every proposition. The Thesis of the "Eclipse of the Sacred": Ethnocentric Approach and Analytical Limitations Weber's torment was not only linked to consequences of a conceptual nature. In the first instance it is an existential</page><page sequence="13">660 SOCIAL RESEARCH phenomenon arising from and linked to the framework of a specific historical situation. It is the lament for the waning of "noble values" in a world no longer Eurocentric. It is the nostalgia for a unified world, theocentric in a Newtonian sense, generically deist, where reason connects and protects all the space socially available to man. It does this to all men and to every man, in the spirit of a Europe which expresses in itself and its own development the meaning and destiny of universal history in terms of a vocation of catholicity and lay mysticism which finds in Novalis's Christianity and Europe a poetic but exact prophecy. The anxiety which is implicit - but at times even openly declared and more or less persuasively statistically "tested" - in the thesis of the "eclipse of the sacred" is part of this general historical framework, and it is not by chance that it gained in intensity and breadth when the decline of Europe as a world center of political and economic decision and universal moral guidance became clear. Terms like "dechristianization," "paganization," and "desacralization," with all these imply by way of perverse upset and impious destruction, began to have currency and resonance as a sinister, impending threat in centers of tradition and of study. They were hastily put into the general category of the "irrational" as an overall connota- tion of antihistory and anitcivilization. In the event of crisis in a specific church or particular faith, this was seen as a general threat to the sacred and the social order itself. There was lamentation for the obsolescence of man as such, for his im- minent ruin as a human being needful of permanent and metaindi vidual meanings, only because a fall had been noticed in attendance at Mass on Sunday, or of vocations in the Catholic priesthood, or in the numbers of seminary students. The historicological sequence from "secularization" ("disen- chanting of the world"), "desacralization," and "eclipse of the sacred" seemed plausible and verifiable to many scholars. The fall of the sacred was taken for granted. There was talk of a</page><page sequence="14">THE DESTINY OF REASON 661 new millennium preceded by the collapse of religious experi- ence and by the victory of the irrational. It seems to me that exactly the opposite is occurring. Far from being in eclipse, the "sacred" shows it has a vital social function, though one both complex and hard to interpret. New forms of rationality are pressing forward behind the closed, dogmatic facade of the formal institutional structures of tradition. Only dichotomous and a priori reason could erase and exorcize them as "work of the devil." The crisis of church religion and the eclipse of the sacred as a raw material ad- ministered by formal hierocratic structures do not affect - indeed, they paradoxically stimulate - the rise and affirmation of new basic forms of association, extra- and antiecclesiastical, in which religious experience is being rediscovered at its most profound. Religious experience, that is, seen as personal re- ligiosity, as the irreducible contact of the individual with the extramundane, the "inrush of grace" as a nonmediated gift, freely conferred charisma, rationally inexplicable but not thereby devoid of rationally intelligible and socially important functions. How has it been possible to fall into such a gross error of interpretation? The thesis of the "eclipse of the sacred" was spread rapidly and took shape in the Christian-Catholic sphere as the op- posed, symmetrical equivalent of the philosophy of crisis in the field of lay culture. Its fate seems to be mainly tied to concerns of a practical nature, particularly to the pastoral concerns of the Catholic clergy, legitimate enough but notably misleading if adopted as the basic guiding premises and hy- potheses for serious cognitive research. It is the pseudoscien- tific confirmation of the commonplace expression in the popular complaint that "there's no religion anymore." The limitations of the argument seem to stem from a double cause. At its root, it is easy to perceive mechanisms of self- censureship and unwarranted restrictions in the area of the problematic due to a basically ethnocentric attitude which</page><page sequence="15">662 SOCIAL RESEARCH makes universal, or really human, religious experience coin- cide with the historical tradition and pious practices of the Christian, Catholic religion. It is the members of the hierar- chical structure of the Church who, legitimately from their point of view, are concerned by the crisis of the parish and the dwindling of religious observance (Mass, sacraments, priestly vocation, public image of the clergy and its ability to direct the behavior of the public, and so forth). In connection with this, one should investigate another internal cause, really of a conceptual kind. One observes here a defect in the calibration of the instruments of analytical sociol- ogy. There is a lack of the critical acclimatization which could make the historical character of sociological concepts and the relativity regarding determinate contexts emerge. The experi- ence of the sacred and, more broadly, religious experience as administered by the Catholic hierarchy cannot cover the whole of the experience of the sacred as such. The very concept of religion goes beyond the concept and the practice of "church- religion" and can rationally be extended to the postulation not only of deistic religion, atheist in the Spinozan sense, but even, as is now recognized by many theologians, to the conception and practice of a religion "without God," or one based on the "death of God." That God is one conceived of as the source of paternal authority and symbol and center of power, and the religion postulated has the aim of guaranteeing the possibility of personal, metautilitarian membership to the individual be- liever, over and above any system of commercial transaction based on an otherworldly system of rewards and punishments. As regards these systems, which reflect the daily practice of commercial society in terms of moral theology, and which reduce ethics to a complex accounting system of profits and losses, there are models now being formulated, both within and outside the Christian tradition, of "religiosity" as personal experience and rediscovery of the individual in the face of the sacred, and which militate against the thesis of the "eclipse of</page><page sequence="16">THE DESTINY OF REASON 663 the sacred" and firmly mark the limits of its empirical de- monstrability. Careful, intellectually honest analysts like Sabino S. Ac- quaviva7 have documented the most serious shortcomings of the arguments in the course of their own laborious research in this connection and in their own difficult, evolving process of interpretation. It is enough to consider, in Acquaviva's case, the modifications gradually carried out on the argument from the first edition of the book in which it was enunciated in 1961 to the third in 1971. Little by little the awareness grew that the difficulty of "explaining the phenomena of the conversion of the world to the profane" becomes insurmountable for the simple reason that such phenomena do not exist, do not have the weight apparently attributed to them by common opinion. They may exist only by reason of the extrareligious structure of power and influence of the clergy at various levels; they are amply counterbalanced wherever a relative abandonment of the church and the sacraments gives evidence of them by different, new forms of experience of the sacred, unrecorded forms which seem typical of a period of crisis like the present. To understand the relative success of the thesis of the "eclipse of the sacred" one must remember, in a narrower con- text, that it translated into scientific terms a state of un- doubted unease of the Catholic clergy in Western Europe. This uneasiness for some time, from the immediate postwar period on, had reasoned expression with a significant effect. As an example I draw attention to Paul Schmitt-Eglin's re- search, Le m'echanisme de la déchristianisation (Paris, 1952), which can rightly be considered typical. It shows in its overall view and conclusions an understandable nostalgia for an agrarian world, unified and apparently theocentric, though in reality hierocratic, which has now disappeared. It also explains, from the practical point of view of immediate interests, how all 7 Sabino Acquaviva, L'eclissi del sacro nella civiltà industriale (Milan: Edizioni di Com- munità, 1961).</page><page sequence="17">664 SOCIAL RESEARCH those forms of experience of the sacred which do not com- pletely fit into the framework of the church's bureaucratic organization, and which consequently escape its direct control, are put on one side, obliterated and even completely blacked out. Notwithstanding this, it is a fact that these forms exist, resist, and spread. Dichotomous reasoning, helped by the dominant culture, tends to relegate them to the limbo of the irrational, washing its hands of them. We have already seen, however, that the relationship between rational and irrational is not a dichotomy but a polarity. What today appears irrational can also be just the préfiguration of tomorrow's rational, or the expression by analogy - seemingly unreal and incomprehen- sible - of a wholly real and widespread need at the point of daybreak, of a social question to which for the moment there is no suitable answer. Rationality is rationality with respect to values which are historically changeable. Values on the other hand owe their status as values to the connection which links them to emerging human needs in historically determinate situations. The Paradox of the "Sacred" The rational is a relationship: it is intersubjective discourse and hence a communication which refers to the community and to a complex of shared and jointly experienced meanings. The rational, consequently, involves necessarily and additionally a distribution of power and the healing of the wound inflicted on the unitary social body by the division of labor and the specialization of roles. The rational as public discourse, there- fore, is capable of a critical reflection on itself, agreed upon between basically equal subjects, and of self-correction accord- ing to their specific contributions. It is, however, not a closed discourse, and cannot be congealed into the only rationally possible discourse lest it be degraded into a dogma in the service of an</page><page sequence="18">THE DESTINY OF REASON 665 elite, whose very formation and privatization of the rational by appropriating the discourse which corresponds to reason in a given historical phase denies community, monopolizes intersubjective communication, refuses to understand others, blocks potential devel- opment, and mutilates "possible consciousness.'9 The rational is not a specific content but a form of language, relatively standardized and free from privatizing idiosyn- cracies, ascertainable by all and open to all, and in this sense a public procedure and not a private domain. As form, not con- tent, it cannot be identified with any given specific content without denying its discursive nature, just as it cannot accept any type of system, or coordinated and logically coherent unity of terms and propositions which is not an open system which can avoid excluding a priori the other infinite, intersub- jective, possible languages. When the rational is identified with a specific content, one stipulated, dogmatized, the spirit of system, with its tendentially closed formal consistency, cuts the link which connects it to the experienced, the real, instead of guaranteeing the norms which control the discourse, ensuring its indefinite con- tinuance. This makes it then necessary to leave the system, or accuse the dominant rationality of being a rationality that has betrayed itself (as public procedure), letting itself become privatized, in order to regain life - that is, the broadest base for experience and human discourse. Rationality had become absurd, a well-reasoned madness. As it has been said, he is mad who has lost everything to save reason. The rational, therefore, is understood as a discourse open also to the irrational in order to understand it in a positive sense, to understand its real, hidden reasons, as a signal, an inarticulate plea for help, or as symptom. It has rightly been said that "the essence of thought and knowledge is generally too restricted, because it is reduced to an intellect which thinks mechanically, and is exhausted in distinctions, definitions and schemes. Consequently the experience we gain from an in- complete, restricted and formalized thought makes us believe</page><page sequence="19">666 SOCIAL RESEARCH that thought brings confusion, and so this produces the ten- dency to disown it as something which introduces uneasiness to life."8 Eclipse of the sacred? By no means. In addition: the crisis of bureaucratic-formal rationality enlarges the space of the sacred, raises it up as an alternative, an opportunity and instrument of human survival. The supporters of the thesis of "eclipse of the sacred" hold that the creation of a new religion is necessary. Mean- while, however, they close their eyes to the forms of the sacred which flourish in a time of crisis, such as today, only because these forms cannot be well adapted to nor fit perfectly into their preconstituted schemes. The sacred is not that so deter- mined and administered by the Catholic hierarchy. Nor, on the other hand, can one create a new religion by decree. There are objectives which cannot be realized just by decisions of a bureaucratic or voluntaristic kind. These proposals do not work, just as no one can reasonably propose to become a poet. These illusions are symptomatic of a dangerously mechanical approach. Stendhal described l'amour de tete convincingly. However, someone who is not in love cannot generally force himself to love; he would end up playing the part of a lover as ardent in words but cold within. Now we are approaching the paradox of the sacred. The problem arises of how conceptually to define the sacred and understand how the alternative to rational discourse may not be purely and simply irrational (public discourse versus pri- vate discourse), but the "sacred" as the "other" as regards the rational, that is, as "preterrational." We have to grasp too how, on the other hand and at the same time, the sacred itself can, indeed must, return to in ter subjective human discourse as the need for a complex of metautilitarian meanings. This dis- course is at the root of all sociality, and the return of the sacred allows society not to lose its own problematic consciousness and not to be deprived of the social function of utopia. "Jaspers, Vernunft und Existenz, p. 149.</page><page sequence="20">THE DESTINY OF REASON 667 The rational appears, in essence, as the intersubjectively com- municable, and hence as a mobile concept, outside the rigidity of dichotomous reasoning, not circumscribed (not precon- ceived), but ready to extend its own boundaries according to new collective experience, the acquisition of new meanings and aspiration linked to average social awareness. Thus the transition from closed to open system is made. The dialectical pole is fixed between rational (and "irrational"), or meaning- fully communicable, and "sacred," or "unsayable." How, then, can we conceptualize what we cannot "say"? This is a difficult problem, before which the sciences of observation must at the outset confess their powerlessness. The paradox of the sacred, reduced to essentials, is as follows: The "sacred" is the metahuman which is necessary for human sociality and without which life is flat, the "sense of the prob- lem," or what is really (uniquely) human in the human, is lost. The Ambiguity of the "Sacred" How can we define the undefinable? We can hazard operative definitions, based on observation of behavior conventionally defined as "sacred," or attempt sym- bolic, analogous, or allusive definitions. There are those who attempt an essentially introspective, philosophical definition, for whom the sacred is a Kantian a priori, or those, like Rudolf Otto, who emphasize its absolute inaccessibility inasmuch as it is a numinous reality, something tremendum and fascinans at the same time, so that it can at once be defined as "horror," "void," or "nullity," and yet at the same time also as "frisson" and "wholly other." This otherness, for homo religiosus, is, in Mircea Eliade's view, the only true reality, reality par excellence: "The real par excellence is the sacred, because only the sacred is absolutely, acting effectively, creating, making things per- sist."9 Again, "Homo religiosus believes an absolute reality 9 Mircea Eliade, Le mythe de l'étemel retour (Paris: Gallimard 1949), p. 29; emphasis in original.</page><page sequence="21">668 SOCIAL RESEARCH exists: the sacred, which transcends this world, but is manifest in it and consequently sanctifies it and makes it real."10 Therefore the sacred and religion are indissolubly connected; as against the profane, the sacred is the essence, the beginning and the basis of every historical religion. There is no doubt the sacred is at the center of the religious phenomenon, conceived of in the ecclesiastical (hierocratic-bureaucratic) sense or the personal (as religiosity more or less secularized), and is its core. However, the religious conception of the sacred does not exhaust the concept as such, as absolute transcendence and consequently nonexistent, as present in absence, everywhere pre- cisely because it is nowhere. This is why the sacred concerns the homo religiosus but involves in addition the future of the figure I should like simply to define as homo humanus. This is the essential ambiguity of the sacred. We can say nothing about it, but find it in everything, everywhere - present as an absence. We are like moths attracted to, and burnt by, its flame. Or again: the sacred is like the idea-limit (Grenz-Begriff) which cannot be related, still less reduced, to the ideal- typical schema of empirical sociological observation. It is an idea-limit insofar as it is never wholly grasped or possessed, "appropri- ated" or incorporated, but which nonetheless gives tension to the dynamics of research, and is connected with the funda- mental direction which gives meaning (consciousness of the direc- tion of movement) to human life. Yet if the sacred is the heart, the essence, of the religious phenomenon, is it ever possible to have a sacred which is self-directed? Or does that necessarily imply the end, the exhaustion, and the death of religion? But what is religion? Is it enough to define it, as has so often been done, by way of viewing its crisis accompanied by the eclipse of the sacred, as the guardian of the sacred, or on the other hand to reduce it to a psychagogic and pastoral function? It is useful to set out once more from Émile Durkheim and 10 Mircea Eliade, Le sacre et le profane (Paris: Gallimard, 1965), p. 171.</page><page sequence="22">THE DESTINY OF REASON 669 the measured, basic division he establishes between sacred and profane. This broad distinction has its advantages when it comes to clear ground bristling with difficulties both ter- minological and substantial. In the second place, as regards my personal intellectual development, a reconsideration of Durkheim's argument also serves the purpose of a critical retrospective glance over a path traveled with so much ef- fort.11 Searching for a sociocentric, purely human ethic which, freed from any otherworldly purpose, might contain in itself the arguments for its own justification, Durkheim defined the basic characteristics of the sacred with rabbinic meticulousness. It is well known that in Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse (1912), Durkheim proposed to study totemism in Australia, but that he did not at all want thereby to limit his conclusions to the explanation of primitive or "simple" religions (in the sense of the distinction between "popular" or ethnologically interesting religions, and the Weltreligionen proper, the "uni- versal religions" like Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, etc., those studied by Max Weber, among others, in his Aufsätze zur Reli- gionssoziologie. Durkheim studied elementary religion for a frankly methodological reason: because, in his view, in those religions one can see springing up the basic, genetically pure, and universal elements of all other religions, which are then re- garded as undergoing a process of acculturation, and thence of intellectualistic elaboration in their subsequent diachronic development. This is hardly the place to mention that this framework allows, as it now seems clear to me, objections which can be raised regarding the explanations of the reli- gious phenomenon made in an evolutionist manner, if only because they confuse the essence of a phenomenon with its 11 I refer in particular to my related essay on the sociological interpretation of the religious phenomenon in Durkheim and Weber published in Culturologia del sacro e del profano (Milan, 1966). See too, for a revision and development of that perspective, my book Toward a Social Production of the Sacred (Essay Press, 1977).</page><page sequence="23">670 SOCIAL RESEARCH actual historical origin. However, Durkheim's intentions are unequivocal: "Since all religions are comparable, because they are all varieties of the same genus, necessarily there are essen- tial elements that they have in common."12 The aim of Durkheim's research is to find a definition that could be applied to all religions, and for that reason, if this definition is to be really applicable in a general sense, it is necessary to concentrate on the fundamental, "elementary" aspects of the religious phenomenon while rigorously exclud- ing those ideas and principles - for example, the notion of god and the supernatural - which are not common to all religions. In Durkheim's view, the basic elements are "beliefs" and "rites." An examination of these two basic elements allowed Durkheim to discover what they presuppose and, by means of this presupposition, to establish the first principle of every reli- gious phenomenon. This first principle lies in the opposition be- tween sacred and profane: "All religious beliefs display the same common characteristic: they presuppose a classification of things which men set up in two classes, as two opposed types, described clearly enough in the terms profane and sacred. A division of the world into two areas, one including all that is sacred, and the other all that is profane, is the characteristic of religious thought.13 For Durkheim, therefore, between sacred and profane, rather than a distinction there is a separation, and hence an absolute exclusion. We are dealing with two spheres existing on different levels, completely heterogeneous, between which there is no communication, no interchange. The passage from one area to another involves, if it is to take place in the ritual forms laid down, a radical transformation. A nonritual pas- sage, a clandestine one, as it were, amounts to a genuine destruction. The price of violating the sacred, sacrilege, is a very high one, that of death with no escape. For this reason, Durk- 12 Cf. Emile Durkheim, Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse, Le système tot'emique en Australie (Paris: Alean, 1912), p. 6. 13 Ibid., pp. 50-51.</page><page sequence="24">THE DESTINY OF REASON 671 heim says, between the two areas, the sacred and the profane, there must be a void, an uncontaminated expanse in which "normal life" is suspended, so that precisely this suspension may proclaim the nearness of the extraordinary. For Durkheim, religion is the collective consciousness of this tabu, this forbidden zone: a collective consciousness, it is hardly necessary to add, which Durkheim believes he has deduced correctly from religious practices really experienced. "A religion," he concludes, "is a joint system of beliefs and practices relating to sacred things, that is, separate, forbidden things, and these beliefs and practices unite in a single moral community called a Church by all those belonging to it."14 The concept of the sacred - or more accurately of the separation between sacred and profane - is basic to the establishment and functioning of religion as an institution or "collective thing." (The term "institution" should be read here in its sociological sense, broader than the formally codified juridical one, yet including a certain degree of fluidity so as to rule out the analytical distinction between and still more the counterposing of "institution" and "movement." That would be possible only by using a contradictorily rigid conception of institution, a nonsociological one.) In Durkheim's explanation of the religious phenomenon the rights and wrongs of positivism and paleorationalism become clear. Aside from the intrinsic limits of any dichotomous rea- soning, so sharp a break between sacred and profane loses sight of the problematic aspect of the question. That aspect concerns the sacred as a composite category of heterogeneous elements in tension, and in particular the possibility of grasp- ing the dialectic existing between profane-sacred-divine in such a way as not to isolate the sacred from the human world and additionally to return it, as all religions propose, to the heart of the real relations taking place between real (historical) people. Far from being based on the break between sacred and profane, religion would 14 Ibid., p. 65.</page><page sequence="25">672 SOCIAL RESEARCH seem to be essentially justified, as a deontological attitude and relevant social insititution, in that it mediates the relation between the human and the divine by administering the sa- cred. The Dialectical Relation between Sacred and Profane, and the Question of the Third Term The basic tendency of Durkheim's explanation of the reli- gious phenomenon is reductionist. It tends to see in religion a collective fact. This is not its novelty. Both the "optimalist" definition, that which tends to view religion as a phenomenon which arises already "complete," and thus complex, and the "minimalist" definitions, or those which appear to be con- cerned to establish the simple, and hence common, elements of all religions (perhaps under the illusion that what is initial is also necessarily "elementary") see an experience of the collectivity in the religious phenomenon. What characterizes and distin- guishes Durkheim's purpose is that this collective experience is reduced to the society in which it arises and develops. For Durkheim, the source of the sacred is in society: more, it is society itself. Just as Ludwig Feuerbach attempted to trans- form theology into anthropology, one can say Durkheim tries to transform the sacred and religion into sociology, or into a socially important and sociologically analyzable institution. For Durkheim, religion is not, in the last analysis, a system of mediation and hence a path toward God, but, more simply and radically, the process of deification society carries out as regards itself. Thus one moves by way of revelation interpreted by the church and the hierarchy thus authorized to the immanence and self-creation of them. In Durkheim the sacred is conse- quently the equivalent of society. To put it more precisely, it is there to demonstrate, in mystified forms, the power of coercion, mysterious but real, which society, or rather the "social fact," is able to exercise and make effective on the individual.</page><page sequence="26">THE DESTINY OF REASON 673 On the other hand, the sacred does not have in Durkheim a demonstrable specific reality. If it had one, the reductionist process to which Durkheim submits it would explode. Hence for Durkheim the sacred is only what is held to be sacred. Here there is an initial, momentous conclusion: the most rigorous "factualism" falls into the most radical nominalism. Moreover, and in essence, the total, mutual extraneousness of sacred and profane argued by Durkheim prevents him from understanding the dialectical relation between the two terms. The relation of sacred and profane is not static, is not given once and for all. It cannot be expressed in terms of a relation frozen dogmatically according to a logic purely and simply of exclusion. Instead, the line of demarcation between the two levels is movable and highly problematic. In this mobility the "progression" - the genesis, fortune, and decline - of religious phenomena has to be read. Precisely from this mobility the dialectical character of the relation between the two terms is derived. This is not the place to carry out a theoretical investigation of this particular "dialectical character." One can, however, say that this is not a question of the Hegelian and neo-Hegelian dialectic, of the right or the left, as is normally meant when turning to a terminology typical of contingent political "sides," and which at once disqualifies itself, or at least raises a doubt about the rigor of the argument. The triadic scheme of thesis-antithesis-synthesis is not involved. Rather, there is a "relational dialectic" which involves the meaningful participa- tion (existential coinvolvement) of human beings with each other according to formulas and schémas not precisely predictable but which necessarily pose the problem of the third term, or project, toward which intersubjective communication, even un- consciously (sometimes apparently irrationally), is tending. In this perspective, the communion of neighbors is spent and re- newed, that is, their interaction in the framework of a complex of shared and jointly experienced meanings. In this perspec-</page><page sequence="27">674 SOCIAL RESEARCH tive, the need for religion can be, in specific historical situations, a collective human need with irreligious and antireligious value.1* More of that later, but for now it is enough to observe that sacred and profane are attracted and repulsed by way of a regularly rhythmic, evolutionary progression of great interest. For Pitirim A. Sorokin, as a basically "external," though careful, observer, this progression suggested the succession of "idea- tional" and "sensate" epochs, whereas the typologies of Saint- Simon ("critical" and "organic" epochs), Spencer ("military" and "industrial"), and Comte's "three stages" seem clearly more rigid and schematic. Religion in the institutional sense takes on the function of control and, still more, of administrator of the relation between sacred and profane (it "binds" and "dissolves"). This function takes note of its ambivalence and contradiction, those which have always scandalized, and will in vainkcontinue to scandalize in the foreseeable future, the "reformers" of the church from within. This in reality enforces contradictory, self- compensating - though symmetrical - swings. Religion tends increasingly to restrict the area of the profane, enforcing the norms of hierocratic power and "invading" daily political and social life, thence passing on, in a different historical phase, to "sec- ularize" the sacred, favoring (apparently) the laicization and au- tonomy of social relations y in a word "opening and reconciling itself to the modern world," to use a rather mystificatory formula, but one in current use. This, in brief, is the logic of the relation of sacred and 15 Naturally, there is a good reason why neither Durkheim nor the Durkheimians could accpt this idea. As Marcel Mauss eloquently observes: "It is not the idea of god, the idea of a sacred person, that one finds over again in any religion, it is the idea of the sacred in general. In the most obscure totemism, in the most primitive ancestor worship, or the most infantile nature worship, we find beings, things, ill-defined, dead phantasms, animal species or natural phenomena which are the objects of a clearly religious effect, separate from the profane world. The notion of god, worship centered on a personality, is only one case, a specific example, a further differentiation of the sentiment of respect originally bestowed on those impersonal and formless powers. In the last analysis, the notion of god is resolved in the notion of the sacred" (Marcel Mauss, Oeuvres [Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1968], 1: 97).</page><page sequence="28">THE DESTINY OF REASON 675 profane, if, and to the extent that, the relation is left to the monopolistic control of church-religion. The ambivalence of the latter, which is a decisive factor through its extraordinary capacity for survival as an organization, makes plain and thus helps us understand the uselessness, aside from the slight or nonexistent cognitive value, of concepts like those related to so-called "secular religions." This is especially true when these are applied to modern political parties, as Jules Monnerot does in his still valuable Sociologie du communisme, or again as used by those hasty commentators who discuss and write blithely of "party-churches" without being aware that the "sec- ular" is already much more than "profane." What they, along with the supporters of the thesis of the "eclipse of the sacred," find it hard to understand is that religion is desacrifying. The Eclipse of Religion Faced with the corrosive effects of the sacred-profane dialectic, is it still possible or meaningful to attempt an exhaustive definition of the religious phenomenon?16 Defini- tions of religion are many and extraordinarily elusive. An annotated list of them would unfortunately not be very in- structive. What one can freely assert is that a definition of religion claiming to be exhaustive, and thus rigid and closed, is not admissible. We may agree that religion presents itself everywhere as the privileged guardian, the administrator and the guarantor of the sacred. However, for religion too the closeness of the sacred is "dangerous." As a privileged means of access to the divine, the power of the sacred is inversely proportional to that of officially constituted religion. As a necessary and needful product of human groups, the sacred is the toad of God in the throat of each human being. In every 16 At the time I wrote my article for the volume Cutturologia del sacro e del profano, this seemed not only possible but a duty.</page><page sequence="29">676 SOCIAL RESEARCH culture just as in every individual's life there develops a ten- sion between sacred and profane. However, a phenomenon already pointed out by Durkheim must be noted: the "contagion" of the sacred. The power of the sacred is such that an enclosure which can guarantee its seclusion, if not its inaccessibility, is a simple security measure. This is also because the sacred is indeed potency, strength, power, and yet the sign of dramatic fragility: it is a short step from cosmos to choas, and a fall is always possible. Thus the sacred is an assurance, but also a threat. Naturally, accepting the postulate of the divine, or taking for granted the existence and transcendency of the divine, the existence of God, things would become remarkably easier. As has been tellingly observed, the sacred must then become an element of the profane, in the sense that it would be placed as a mediator between profane and divine, more exactly as the echo of the divine in the human-profane. The downgrading of the sacred from substantive to adjective would certainly help and confirm the status of church religion as administrator and mediator in the dialectical profane-sacred-divine relation. However, this enterprise, from the conceptual point of view and in the light of the real historical documentation, appears far from easy. No doubt the distinction of three levels (pro- fane, sacred, divine) would smooth out many difficulties, from the theological and hermeneutic point of view. Others how- ever, perhaps also more serious, would arise. Could such a threefold distinction be effectively applied to the formal struc- ture of religion taken as a universal phenomenon, on a docu- mentary foundation which is empirically confirmable? Consider the five universal religions studied by Max Weber, and especially Hinduism, for example, in which the means of access to the divine is by devotion, and thus not a cognitive- speculative approach, nor a ritual one in the strict sense, but rather one of pure "interior movement," in the sense of an individual disposition. Can this in itself be called "sacred," still using the weak meaning of sacred (as adjective)?</page><page sequence="30">THE DESTINY OF REASON 677 In any case, to be able to apply the threefold distinction of profane-sacred-divine to different, specific religions, or to religions as historically distinguished from the point of view of sociological, ethnological, and anthropologicocultural re- search, one must expect that often sacred and divine may become confused. That is, one at least of the two terms may be missing, insufficiently developed, or only vaguely suggested: in other words, it is present only as a possibility, a potential not yet translated into a presence which is reflected on, conceptu- ally consistent, and consciously acknowledged by the believers. It has been rightly observed that, especially in primitive reli- gions, sacred and divine tend to become confused. In these religions a clear distinction between divinity and the mediating elements we call sacred - stones, animals, people, rites, etc. - is not always maintained. That is, there is an excessive personali- zation of the divine which ultimately confuses it with its sym- bol. According to some scholars, especially those who are be- lievers, it is argued on the contrary that the distinction be- tween sacred and divine, though not made explicit, is present. To Eliade, for instance, it seems clear that the sacred stone or sacred tree is not worshiped as such but only because it bears witness, or takes the place of something which is not, or is no longer only, stone or tree. In my view, the believing scholar expresses himself here by an interpretation in which he adds to empirically investigated reality an element not derived from the empirical findings of the research but rather one which originates directly in his personal value judgment or choice, legitimate in itself but external to the research. One can now also more easily under- stand why Durkheim, Mauss, Hubert and all their school gen- erally tended to consider the sacred and the divine as united, mingled, and generally interchangeable. They were not in reality concerned to preserve the transcendence of the divine and, through that, to endorse the mediating and administrative function of church religion. However, this is directed not only against Durkheim's pos-</page><page sequence="31">678 SOCIAL RESEARCH itivistic school, which for all its hermeneutic and reductionist crudeness has, in this regard, an element of strength still valid today, but also against the best known phenomenological theories. Rudolf Otto, in Das Heilige (1917), sees in the sacred the "totally other," the mysterium tremendum etfascinans, capable of (simultaneously) arousing terror and attraction. However, still earlier, in 1913, Uathan Söderblom, in substantial agree- ment with Durkheim, did not regard the idea of God as essential but underlined the importance of the sacred as a power which strikes terror. In addition, Gerardus van der Leeuw also held that the notion of the sacred is older and more important than the idea of God.17 The relation between the sacred and the natural is restated by Mircea Eliade in his Traite d'histoire des religions, especially in regard to the attitude of the primitive religious man. Here, thé sacred is seen and interpreted in relation to the great cosmic polarities. The sky symbolizes the Highest and transcendence, vertical ascent, lévitation, the spirituality of the heights - the mountain, but also meteorological phenomena such as thun- der, lightning, storms, sun, and moon. These symbols empha- size the power of the sacred and its inaccessibility, but at the same time the poverty, weakness, and powerlessness of logicospeculative argument, and the inadequacy of theological explanations administered ecclesiastically, which an immediate relationship with the sacred, or the presence of charismatics and their "gifts," can surpass. The sacred universe is thus a powerful one, but also uncertain, dramtically exposed to the possibility of destruction because it is unpredictable, nonlogi- cal, and mysterious. The (ambiguous) maternity of the sacred be- comes manifest as one which is directly linked to the major natural phenomena and at the same time controls them, holds them tightly and if needs be "cancels" them. Thus every existing thing has no value in itself, but instead is only a 17 Gerardus van der Leeuw, La religion dans son essence et ses manifestations (Paris: Payot, 1955), esp. pp. 35-36.</page><page sequence="32">THE DESTINY OF REASON 679 symbol, a weak duplicate or resemblance of a real hidden, powerful reality (Alles Vergängliche-Ist nur ein Gleichnis). Thus, by way of the game of analogies of symbolic corre- spondences, the maternity of the sacred is established. How- ever, it is, as we have seen earlier, a capricious, inscrutable maternity. The sacred in reality is also danger. (Perhaps the unpredictable nature of the gods in Homer should be recalled here, their death-dealing jealousy, their unpredictable temper; Jahve's exclusivism is not a game, while the Old Testament is shot through with a constant fear of displeasing a shadowy God, one who is not averse to demanding ruthless trials - like Abraham's sacrifice.) The sacred incinerates and destroys, just as it nourishes and gives meaning and direction. Religion, we have seen, is the guardian of the sacred as intermediate term to the divine, but a nonreligious conception of the sacred is possible, and in addition, in the Christian religion, there is a basic ambiguity which erodes it. This calls it continually in question as a religion or- ganized in the name of "evangelical or gins/9 and as power struc- ture condemns it and indicates self-extinction, suicide, for it. According to Bonhoeffer, it is hard to believe Christ was the founder of a religion. The Gospel - literally the foretelling of the Kingdom of Heaven - goes beyond simple organized reli- gion, which from principle it does not acknowledge. Following this, setting up a church is an error, a relapse of the Pharisaic kind. With extraordinary intelligence, in late Nietzsche this point is grasped, though fragmentarily, and he anticipated, at times literally, most modern theologians on the "death of God." He suggests returning to this theme by way of the case of the ex-professional soldier, Paul of Tarsus (the parallel with an- other soldier, Ignatius Loyola, is striking): Chapter on Paul, the Jewish family in the diaspora, "love," the "free" adaptation by Jesus of everything Jewish-priestly; a) death for our sins; b) the "redeemer" is immortal; deep hatred for culture and knowledge - already Jewish (Genesis 52); the "im-</page><page sequence="33">680 SOCIAL RESEARCH mortal" soul; psychology of "those about to die"; the priest as "fallen angel"; all the church has ruined; 1) mystical exaltation 2) fasting 3) the "monastery" 4) festivals 5) charity18 Nietzsche's criticisms are no stronger than those of some apocalyptic and dissenters' groups which have often seen a "diabolic" quality in the Church. These extra- and an- tiecclesiastical groups, to be found in the Middle Ages as well as the present era, especially in the period after the Ecumeni- cal Council Vatican II, tend to propose, against the obedience which tradition for centuries supposed was owed by the faith- ful to the hierarchy, the freedom of the "sons of God," and more precisely still, the self-determination of the "people of God." There is no doubt that Vatican II tried, especially after the death of John XXIII and making use of Paul VI's ex- traordinary diplomatic gifts, to stem this basic challenge which ran, and runs, counter to the prerogatives of the hierarchy and of the Church organized as a political body, economic center, and power structure. However, it seems destined to come into collision with the internal contradiction of the bu- reaucratic organization which cannot transcend itself without de- stroying itself. In conclusion, the eclipse of church religion seems un- avoidably determined by: (a) the monopoly of the Church itself and its monopolistic power which cannot see, and hence confront, the problems presented all over, on a global scale, to local churches; (b) the "sacred" as a personal experience, which thus escapes control by ecclesiastical teaching and which affirms the charismatic gift beyond, and ultimately against the bu- reaucratic control of church religion (from this point of view, the work of Cardinal Suenens on the "charismatics" and "neopentecostals" is an intelligent counter, but cannot conceal 18 Nietzsche, Frammenti postumi, p. 350; emphasis in original.</page><page sequence="34">THE DESTINY OF REASON 681 its defensive nature as a rearguard action); (c) the exhaustion of shared, basic values for establishing the Christian commu- nity as a really universal community. The only way out would seem to be through a rediscovery of the sacred as of service to man and through a collective impulse toward a neocommunitarian undertaking, where the needs now illusorily satisfied by the experiences of the "charismatics," and generally by the new heterodox, psychologizing forms of the sacred at the level of individual experience could thus find a positive, nonmystifying outlet beyond, and if necessary opposed to, every religion established with exclusive jurisdiction and a discretionary power structure.</page></plain_text>
