Les fouilles du site de Peinan, présentées brièvement dans cette chronique, ont révélé un complexe culturel essentiel à la compréhension de la préhistoire des populations austronésiennes d'Asie du Sud-Est. The site of Peinan, near the city of Taitung (Southeastern Taiwan) was first documented in the Survey Reports on the Formosan Aborigines: the Ami tribe 1 published in 1914 by the Government General, Japan. The site contained tall stone pillars, other stone objects and potsherds which have attracted both professional and amateur anthropologists for many years since it was first reported on. Tadao Kano2 then carefully investigated this site in 1928 and 1929 and published a report entitled «On the megalithic culture of Eastern Formosa3» {Journal of the Anthropological Society of Japan4, 45, 7-8, 1930): as indicated by the title, this report classified it in the category of the so-called megalithic culture of Eastern Taiwan. Takao Kanaseki5 and Naoichi Kokubu6 made a trial digging around the tallest stone pillar of the site in 1945. The result of their excavation was published in 1957 as « Researches on a Prehistoric Site near Peinan, Formosa7 » {Journal of the Shimonoseki College of Fisheries, Civic Science 8, 3, 1957). They concluded that the stone pillars excavated were part of stone walls of a house with a subterranean stone floor of about 15 x 4.3 m. Finally, after more than 30 years of intensive and extensive archaeological investigation in Eastern Taiwan, the present writer has reached the conclusion that two different but closely related neolithic cultures flourished in the area: the Peinan Culture, named after the type site, and the Chilin Culture («The megalithic Culture of Eastern Taiwan9», Ethnos in Asia10, 6, 1976). These two cultures are nearly parallel in time and differ only slightly in their spatial distribution. In 1980 the site was threatened by graveling operations intended for the construction of the new railway station at Peinan. However, a large portion of the site was saved for scientific investigation thanks, mainly, to mass media intervention. Thirteen salvage campaigns from 1980 to 1988 and one trial excavation in 1989 were carried out by an excavation team from the Department of Anthropology, National Taiwan University, under the supervision of the writer and Professor Chao-mei Lien. An area of 9,800 m2 was explored during this period, with excavations uncovering 1512 stone cist coffins and ten other types of burials. The intro- duction to the excavation was published by the writer11 and Chao-mei Lien12 under the title « Excavation at the Peinan Site, Taitung, Taiwan (l)13 » {Bulletin of the Department of Anthro- pology 14 , NTU, 43, 1983: 1 17-136). Six other volumes of the excavation report were prepared by the writer and Chao-mei Lien: • Vol. I, 1984: Excavation at the Peinan Site and Analytical Study of Grave Goods 15 ; • Vol. II, 1985: An Analytical Study of the Stone Cist Coffins of the Peinan Site 16 ; . Vol. Ill, 1986: Analytical Studies of the Stratification of the Site and Cultural Remains from Habitation Levels11 ; • Vol. IV, 1987: An archaeological report on the 9th- 10th excavation campaigns at the Peinan Site, Taiwan (Occasional Paper Series no. 8, Department of Anthropology, NTU)18; • Vol. V, 1988: An archaeological report on the llth-13th excavation campaigns at the Peinan Site, Taiwan (Occasional Paper Series no. 12, Department of Anthropology, NTU)19 • Vol. VI, 1989: Archaeological investigation of the Peinan Site: the Park Area Study (Occasional Paper Series no. 15, Department of Anthropology, NTU)20. The first three volumes are yet unpublished manuscripts (they have been submitted to the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China for printing).</page><page sequence="2">282 BEFEO 79.1 (1992) Analytical studies of the excavated materials have revealed the following characteristics of the site at Peinan. During the time interval from approximately 5,000 to 2,500 BC, the people of the Peinan Culture at Peinan maintained a permanent village on the third terrace (starting from the lowest) of the Peinan River. They appear to have been fully sedentary. Cultivation was their principal mode of subsistence. As shown by the discovery of two dif- ferent types of harvesting tools, stone sickles and stone knives, at least two kinds of seeding crops were raised, probably rice and Chinese millet. This was supplemented by hunting on a rather intensive scale, as indicated by the huge amount of stone arrow and spearheads unear- thed from the site. Fishing does not seem to have played an important role in the subsistence pattern, although ornamental shark teeth were found from a few of the coffins. The basements of dwellings at this site were constructed with slate or schist slabs and/or boulders, and constitute the first unmistakable architectural remains recognized in the archaeology of Taiwan. The architectural pattern of these dwellings remained almost unchan- ged through time. Mortuary customs were similarly unchanging, with villagers burying their dead beneath the living floor of the village. Dwellings and burials share such architectural characteristics as construction materials, construction techniques, location and orientation. Except for one instance among more than 1,500 graves, the orientation is south-southwest/north-northeast. In most cases, the head of the dead point towards the south. Since the dead were buried principally in extended posture, the inner length of the stone cist coffins reflect the approximate height of the Peinan Culture people. Also, the distribution analysis of the inner length of the 895 stone cist coffins that are considered to have been made for a single body shows that the death rate of new-born babies was extremely high, as was that of infants and children and the rate of miscarriages. Up to 20% of the stone cist coffins were made for two or more individuals. Among these, more than 10 large coffins were intentionally constructed not only for multiple burial but also for use over an extended period of time. Therefore it is not unlikely that family cist coffins like those of the Rukai and Paiwan aboriginal groups of Southern Taiwan were also constructed in a few cases. Dwelling houses, front yards, fences and probably also food storage structures have been tentatively identified among the architectural remains of the site. Several burials were found beneath floors inside a number of presumed houses. It is thus hypothesized that the people of the Peinan Culture practiced indoor as well as outdoor burial and that the houses of the site were both for the living and the deceased members of the community. Since the majority of the aboriginal ethnic groups in Taiwan traditionally practiced indoor burial (of a somewhat different pattern), ethnographic parallels provide further support for this suggestion. The preservation of skeletons was very poor in most cases. But it is obvious that the extraction of lateral incisors and canines of the upper jaw was practiced by both sexes as an initiation rite. Exactly the same custom was originally in use among the aboriginal groups of northern and central Taiwan. The main grave objects were various types of pottery, nephrite chisels and adzes, nephrite arrowheads and spearheads, slate bracelets, nephrite necklaces in a variety of shapes, nephrite bell-shaped beads for headbands, and variously shaped split earrings. The latter group - nephrite split earrings - is most abundant and presents a broad variety of shapes. It poses countless problems of archaeological interest. The most common type is a rounded split ring with four projections on its outer side. Similar split earrings are found in archaeological sites of the South China Sea basin only. Whereas the next most common type is a simple rounded ring with a slit, but with no projection. This type of simple split earring occurs widely in archaeological context in East and Southeast Asia. The zoo-anthropomorphic earrings are very peculiar in shape but found in very small numbers. Since exactly the same type of nephrite earrings appears in the Yuanshan Culture of northwestern Taiwan, it has been used as a horizon marker of the two cultures. Most of these grave goods were placed inside the coffins. But in some cases potteries were buried outside of the stone coffins. They were however always unearthed from the eastern side of the southern portion of the coffins. Pottery spindle whirls were uncovered from dwelling houses and living floors in large quantities, but only exceptionally appeared in the stone cist coffins.</page><page sequence="3">Chronique 283 Ph. 1. - The basement of two major types of dwelling houses.

Stone implements for mortuary purpose are mostly made of nephrite (except for the common bracelets that are made of slate), while those for daily use are mostly made of slate and sandstone. Nephrite was a trade commodity from Hualien, some 200 km north of Peinan, but slate and sandstone are to be found locally. Whereas hunting gear such as arrow and spearheads occur liberally in both burial and living places, agricultural implements such as stone hoes, sickles and knives as well as stone pestles were found in large quantities above living floors only, and never from the graves. This fact makes one believe that there may be some kind of taboo regarding the use of agricultural implements as mortuary goods in this agricultural society. Carpenter's tools such as chisels and adzes are very commonly found from both the graves and the cultural layers. The quantity of potsherds unearthed from the Peinan site is so immense that it will take years to study them. Roughly speaking, Peinan potteries are reddish in color and plain, without decoration. Vessel types for daily use are mainly globular pots with a pair of vertical handles attached to the upper end of the rim and the shoulder of the body. A ring foot is sometimes attached to the bottom of the body. Pottery covers are of the central sunken type, with a bridge handle on top of them. Pottery for daily use is rather coarse and thick, whereas that for mortuary purpose is thinner in texture and make - at times extremely thin - and presents a variety of shapes. Very peculiar shapes occur only in the latter category. Decora- tion in the form of punctuation occurs commonly on the upper side of the biconical spindle whirls, but very rarely on the pottery vessels. Sung Wen-Hsun, National Taiwan University. Notes 1.
