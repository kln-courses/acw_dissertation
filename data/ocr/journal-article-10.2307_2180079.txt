<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTRIBUTION OF MAX SCHELER TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION PJ1O observers of recent developments in European philosophy the extraordinary influence obtained by the school of Phe- nomenology in the country of its birth, even within the lifetime of its founder, may appear surprising in view of its failure so far to affect the thought of other countries to any considerable degree. It would, however, be exaggerating the paradox of the situation to ascribe this rapid increase in adherents to the spread of a philo- sophical theory. If, in the last analysis, Phenomenology implies a metaphysical system, it was certainly, both in its historical origin and in its logical basis,' a method rather than a metaphysic, and it is primarily as a method of investigating problems in the mental sciences (Geisteswissenschcaften) that it has attracted minds of such diverse philosophical tendencies as Meinong, Dilthey, Lipps, Nikolai Hartmann, to name only a few of the most outstanding thinkers who have at one time or another been associated with it. The most superficial study of the writings of those who have grouped themselves under this common banner would reveal that the community among them amounts to little more than the employment in many different fields-metaphysics, ethics, psycho- logy, psycho-pathology, philosophy of law, philosophy of religion- of the practice of describing and interpreting experiences as they occur in the life-history of an individual or a society, as opposed to the genetic and experimental method of scientific or, as Husserl names it, "explanatory psychology", which performs its tests by means of the artificial combination and separation of elements, and includes in its explanations many factors (e.g., physiological con- ditions in the organism) which are causally connected with ex- perience, but lie quite outside its range. That it has lately been de- veloped by its authors into an idealism of a kind little likely to excite the sympathy of English or American readers today may, on the other hand, explain its lack of influence on the thought of nations whose attention it has naturally been slower to reach, and who have thus frequently become acquainted with its later phases I As witness its earliest presentation in Volume II of Edmund Husserl's Logische Untersuchu~ngen, Halle igoo-oi. 577</page><page sequence="2">578 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. as early as with its original doctrines.2 It is matter for regret that the acquaintance of English-speaking peoples with the contribution of this "school" should be confined almost entirely to the logical and metaphysical theories of its founder, Husserl, whilst the fruits of his method, or of methods clearly derived from it, in related fields are almost completely ignored. It is not, however, within the scope of this article to offer a sur- vey of these products. It is its purpose merely to draw attention to the results of its application to the philosophy and psychology of religion by the thinker who undoubtedly inspired this line of in- vestigation,3 the late Max Scheler. It is no easy task to summarize even this contribution, for it was in this field that Scheler's extraordinarily original but not always very systematic thought underwent the profoundest changes during the course of his mental history. The son of a Jewish mother and a. Protestant father, he became during his stu- dent-years a convert to the Catholic religion, of which he remained for more than twenty years an apparently devoted adherent, and it was as an outstanding representative of Catholic thought in Ger- many that he was appointed in I919 to the Chair of Philosophy in the University of Cologne and to the Directorship of the Insti- tute of Research in the Social Sciences in that city. A few years after accepting this position, however, he severed his connection with the Church, and displayed himself during the last six or seven years of his life as a vigorous opponent of institutional religion. Al- though his apostasy, which was largely provoked by criticisms from the leaders of the Church of his private mode of life, was appar- ently the ground rather than the consequence of the revolution in his thought at this period, it is evident from his writings during the ensuing years that release from this early loyalty had become an intellectual need with him, and that he was moving, under the influence of his sociological and anthropological studies, towards a definitely anti-theistic metaphysic. He did not, however, accom- plish the larger work that he had projected on this subject, and 2 In Husserl's Ideen zu einer reinen Phlinomen'ologie und phdnomenolo- gischer Philosophie (Halle 19I3), the only one of his works that has so far appeared in English, his metaphysical assumptions are already apparent, though they are less carefully substantiated here than in his later writings. 8It has been carried farther in the writings of K. Stavenhagen, E. Pryz- wara, Jean Hering, and others.</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 579 we possess little more than an outline of his later theory. His most detailed and, curiously enough, in many respects his most original contribution to religious thought belongs to his Catholic period. How much of this he afterwards intended to repudiate I shall presently try to show. Scheler's most systematic account of his religious position dur- ing this earlier period is contained in his Probleme der Religion, which forms the principal essay of the collection entitled Vom Ewige-n im Menschen,4 originally intended to comprise three vol- umes, only the first of which had, however, appeared at the time of his breach with Catholicism. The specific problem with which this essay deals is the nature of religious knowledge, in which, as a phenomenologist, Scheler distinguishes carefully between 'the religious act' and its object, a matter on which he claims to be defending an Augustinian posi- tion, in opposition to the views of Aquinas and of Kant. The rela- tion between religious and metaphysical knowledge thus becomes a crucial question for him, and he devotes considerable space to its determination.5 Of the four possible views, z., the total or the partial identity of the two fields, of their total disparity, or their conformity as distinct systems, he defends the last, as much, ap- parently, in order to vindicate the claims of metaphysical know- ledge and to rid it of theological entanglements as from the desire to exhibit the independent basis of religion. St. Thomas was wrong, he thinks, in distinguishing 'natural religion', as a species of meta- physical knowledge, from revelation. All religious knowledge, as Augustine and the Jansenists recognized, is immediate knowledge; unlike scientific or philosophical knowledge, which is a product of the independent working of the intellect, it is given, i.e., in some sense revealed. Revelation cannot, then, be confined to special histo- rical occasions; it proceeds continuously by natural means, though there are many grades of it: in inanimate nature, in life, in the soul of man, in society, and in history. The special revelations claimed by the historical religions have the largest positive content, but they 4Leipzig I92I. 5 Vom Ewigen im Menschen 3I7-375.</page><page sequence="4">580 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. differ from the others only in degree. Metaphysics has a different psychological origin from religion and follows a different path. Man has a basic metaphysical need-the need born of the wonder of existence, the wonder that something is, rather than nothing, the need to understand the world. Its object is Absolute Being. The religious need, on the other hand, is man's need of redemption. Its object is the summum blonum, apprehended as a value transcend- ing moral and aesthetic values, the value of the Holy. Philosophy cannot, then, be the handmaid of religion or vice versa, though it is important to understand-and here Scheler's phenomenological standpoint is again apparent-that the Supreme Being of both is identical in re, their objects differ only in intentions; in more popu- lar language, though the Supreme Reality is one, these diverse lines of approach apprehend it, as it were, from different angles, hence under different forms. The philosophical view alone is too abstract and formal, for the intellect can grasp only its most gen- eral aspects as self-dependent reality (ens a se) and ultimate ground of all relative being. The religious view alone is too limited and anthropomorphic. Only through a synthesis of the two per- spectives, in which what is anthropomorphic in the latter is recog- nized as symbolic, or analogical, can the fullest knowledge of God be attained. Philosophy has, however, a second function in relation to re- ligion, for it is concerned not only with absolute but also with rela- tive being. It is thus able to relate the truths of religion to other fields, from which it might otherwise remain divorced.6 Religions which neglect or subordinate metaphysical knowledge expose them- selves to the dangers of other-worldiness and subjectivism. We have an example of this subjectivism in Luther's insistence on faith as an individual matter, the condition of salvation being inner ex- perience,7 and, again, in contemporary discussions, as to whether religion is a matter of feeling or of the active direction of will- questions that are as irrelevant to such a subject as prayer as the bodily movements or mental imagery of the mathematician are irrelevant to the truths he demonstrates.8 In religion, as in all other fields of knowledge, the awareness of the object is prior to the awareness of the knowing. And the object of the religious con- fOp. cit. 354.

This is an original datum of experience. We know God as absolute in contrast to all other objects, each of which is relative to others, dependent on causes outside itself. We do not infer Him from our feeling of dependence, as Schleiermacher thought. The knowledge of God is not an inference from the nature of the self; it is rather, in the Cartesian sense,'0 an immediate per- ception of the essential dependence of all finite things, of the pri- ority of absolute to relative being. Our selves, our world, are so presented that in knowing them we know God in them, albeit not in the same degree in all things, for some are more appropriate sym- bols of Him than others. Nevertheless-and this is perhaps Scheler's most important pro- nouncement on the psychology of religion-the knowledge of God as absolute is not the primary datum of religious experience. Such knowledge would never arise, were it not for our first awareness of God as Holy; for it is a basic principle of his theory of know- ledge that objects are first apprehended in their value-aspect, as good or bad, attractive or repulsive, and only secondly as real."' In other words, we notice what matters to us, and ignore whatever is not felt to be from some point of view significant. Thus we know God first through our intuition of the quality of holiness. Only after we have experienced the mingled awe and fascination of the Holy Presence do we come to the realization of Him as Absolute, Self-dependent Reality. This value of the Holy is supreme in the order of values,12 as the one to which those capable of experien- cing it immediately perceive that all others, even the values of knowledge or moral good, must give way, should a conflict be- tween them ever arise. For God is not to be identified with beauty, 9Scheler thus claims this as a datum both of metaphysics and of re- ligion. (Cf. op. cit. 379 ff.) 'Although he does not explicitly refer to them, it is evident that Scheler has the arguments of Descarfes and Malebranche in mind throughout this discussion. (Cf. Rend Descartes: Third Meditation, Works, translated by Elizabeth S. Haldane and G. R. T. Ross, Cambridge igiI I i66 if.; Nicolas Malebranche: Entretiens sur la metaphysique, II. (Euvres I (nouvelle edition Paris 1859) 55 ff. "1 Scheler's clearest exposition of this principle occurs in Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik (Second Edition Halle 1921) 12-I3, but it is one that he continually emphasized throughout the develop- ment of his philosophical position. 12Der Formalismus in der Ethik I07-i08.</page><page sequence="6">582 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. or truth, or goodness, nor, as by some philosophers, with the order of values as such ;13 for values are universals, characterizing exist- ing things, they are -not existents, i.e., they are qualities not sub- stances.'4 God exists, but His value is different in kind from the value of any other existent, and the quality of experience through which it is given is wholly distinct from that of moral or aesthetic experience. Scheler does not even admit its analogy with the aesthetically sublime, our attitude to which is similarly contempla- tive, though he ranks contemplation higher than practical activity. The experience of the Holy, he insists, is a unique, immediate experience, having no kinship with any other, and, as stated, it is prior to the intuition of God as Absolute Reality. In spite of the fact that this intuition involves the negation of our own selfhood in the presence of supreme, positive being, we find, when we attempt to go beyond this awareness that an Absolute Being is to a knowledge of what it is, that we can characterize God only negatively. Scheler refers to Rudolf Otto's vivid description of the experience of the Holy as a mysterium tremendum, of majesty, terror, and fascination, whose content can nevertheless be conveyed only by distant analogies or contrasts, since language has no terms in which to define that which is wholly without parallel. It is easy to misunderstand this method, as rationalist critics have so often done, and to suppose that an experience thus negatively characterized must be empty. Actually this negative description is intended only to lead to the threshold of the experience where direct vision shall follow. The criticism mistakes the negative judg- ments employed to turn the mind away from other objects for a description of the new object itself. Unless they act as a vehicle through which a positive reality is grasped, they will indeed ap- pear empty and meaningless, but Otto draws attention to the posi- tive impression conveyed by such language as: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love Him". "Who does not feel the exalted sound of these words'?" he asks, "the Dionysiac element of transport and fervour in them? . . . In such 8 Vom Ewigen irn Menschen 388-391, 549-550. " Scheler does not add this elucidation, but. it seems worth while to draw attention to what this position implies, since it is a subject on which much confusion exists..</page><page sequence="7">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 583 phrases as these . . . all images fall away, and the mind turns from them to grasp expressions that are purely negative." Yet "we can let whole chains of such negations enrapture, even intoxi- cate us"; we can compose entire hymns-and deeply impressive hymns-in which there is really nothing positive at all.'5 Such negative theology, Scheler maintains, clearly with much justice, is an essential basis of the positive theology that char- acterizes God by human analogies, for without it we shall scarcely avoid the irreverence that Spencer condemned of forgetting that the attributes that we assign to the Ultimate Being, derived, as they must be, from our own natures, are "not elevations but degrada- tions", or that implied in the common belief that religion is derived by some process of abstraction or idealization from pre-religious experience.16 Augustine was right that the knowledge of God does not presuppose, or follow as an inference from, a knowledge of the world. An examination of the natural world would indeed suggest the presence of a rational principle in nature, but it would not in itself guarantee its supremacy. A dualistic metaphysic would be a more probable conclusion from it. Conversely, however, no dis- covery concerning "the nature of nature" should suffice to destroy our belief in the supremacy of a Divine Mind. However damaging to the Teleological Proof the scientist's transformations of the external world may appear, we have prior grounds of belief that remain untouched by them.17 If the phenomenological theory of the interdependence of act and object be accepted-specifically the statement derived from Brentano, who claimed to be reviving a Scholastic doctrine, that all acts, whether of cognition, volition, or feeling, are "intentional", i.e., have objective reference-it will be seen to follow that most of the psychological investigations carried out in the domain of religion have totally misrepresented the subject by divorcing mental states from their objects, instead of studying the two in correlation.'8 Scheler even professes to be able to demonstrate the reality of the f R. Otto, The Idea of the Holy (English Translation, Fifth Impression, Oxford i928) 34, referred to by Scheler: Vom Ewigen im Menschen 39I- 396. 1 OP. cit. 397-40I. 17op. cit. 437-440. ' OP. cit. 52I-523.</page><page sequence="8">584 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. object of religion from the nature and conditions of the religious act itself, a claim which, as might be expected, has exposed him to con- siderable criticism, even from writers who seem otherwise to be in agreement with his position.' His argument is again in the Augustinian tradition, frequently recalling the seventeenth-century Augustinians, Malebranche or Pascal.20 The widespread scepticism as to the possibility of such a demon- stration is due, he argues, to two deep-rooted prejudices: (a) That what is given must be given to the senses, a belief that should have been exploded once and for all by the proofs of the phenomenolo- gists (who have the almost unanimous support of contemporary epistemologists in this) that the given actually far exceeds what is sensed, that e.g., space and time, form, meaning, value, are as much given as sensations are; as also by the discovery of Gestalt- psychologists that we know the general structure and form of our world before we receive particular sensations, these latter being merely a system of signs referring to what in the environment is biologically useful or harmful. Obviously the manner in which the objects of religion are given will be wholly different from that in which things are given to the senses, and it is unlikely that a being who lives normally on the perceptual level of brute fact, and has no capacity to apprehend non-sensuous forms nor experience in the exercise of reason, will be able to adopt the mental attitude essential to becoming conversant with the objects of religion. It is through "the love of Ideas", as Socrates taught, that man is released from the bondage of the senses and the body, and reaches a plane where his objects acquire eternal meaning.21 (b) Against the second prejudice, namely that the objects of religion, not being susceptible of rational proof, constitute a merely hypothetical realm of being, Scheler argues that there are modes of demonstration or verification other than proof in this sense. We do not commonly doubt the reality of the realm of perceptual objects, though we are subject to sensory errors and illusions. We recognize the existence of such a realm before we go on to con- sider whether this or that object belonging to it is real, as we do also in the case of the self, our fellow men, etc. In the same way, l9 See especially H. Newe: Die religiose Gotteserkenntnis und ihr Ver- hdltnis zur metaphysischen bei Max Scheler, Wfirzburg 1928. 2 OP. cit. 532-552. 21 Op. cit. 539-542.</page><page sequence="9">No. 6] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 585 then, we should acknowledge a realm of divine essence as an intuited reality before raising the question which of our experi- ences of it are the stablest and most reliable.22 Religion furnishes its own criterion of truth. The givenness of the object of religious experience, and the certainty with which it is apprehended by our consciousness, is the direct and sufficient guarantee of its reality. To demand a further rational proof of it as the basis of belief is, like demanding a proof of the existence of color to guarantee the genuineness of the color-experience; it is to test the more certain by the less.23 Scheler's demonstration (demonstration in the literal sense) of the reality of the object of religious experience is as follows. The religious attitude, he maintains, is as integral an element in human consciousness as perception, memory, or thought, though he after- wards admits that this attitude is as frequently assumed towards an idol that is substituted for God and receives the tribute due to Him alone as toward the Deity Himself.24 Its true object, however, belongs to a sphere that transcends not merely the range of any one finite being's experience but the whole empirical world. The attitude itself is, therefore, sui generis; it can be neither equated with, nor shown to be genetically derived from, any com- mon desires or needs, directed to empirical objects, whether ex- istent or non-existent, for all such naturalistic explanations leave its unique character unaccounted for. It will, of course, be ob- jected that the existence of a religious aspiration is no guarantee of the reality of its object, but to this Scheler replies that an aspiration, whether directed to an empirical or a super-empirical object, at least demands explanation; it itself explains nothing. It can only be explained, moreover, on the presupposition of a general class of objects of the sort desired. The object that would fulfill the specific need may not exist, but, were there no realities of an order that could satisfy it, there would have been nothing to stimulate the desire, or make known the lack. Since, then, religious devotion, religious awe, the desire for the bliss or the consumma- tion of religion, are utterly incapable of satisfaction by any em- pirical object, and cannot, therefore, have been aroused by any- thing in this sphere, the only explanation of their existence is the 22 Op. cit. 542-547. op. cit. 6o7-6o8. 24 Op. cit. 559-564.</page><page sequence="10">586 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. reality of an object commensurable with them. It is absurd to sug- gest, as certain recent writers have done,25 that some future state of the world, a perfected society or culture, could fulfil such aspirations, for the object of religion is in a different dimension; the two ends are quite incommensurable. The religious need could only have been awakened by the object to which it refers. Know- ledge of God, as Augustine saw, is knowledge through God.26 Moreover, religion, in contrast to all other knowledge, demands a response from its object. Strictly speaking, therefore, it can only exist where there is experience of a power that manifests itself. It is a doctrine on which Scheler lays great emphasis27 that we first apprehend reality through its resistance to our activity. Cogni- tion alone would never suffice to distinguish fact from fantasy. It is simply an application of this principle to religion that finds the guarantee of its object in the experience of a presence and a power that acts independently of the subject and in response to it.28 It is as an interaction of this sort with a reality beyond itself that religion defies explanation in psychological terms. It obeys laws of another order, and cannot be analysed into the effects of subjective causes, nor described as a special faculty or disposition without reference to its object. For it is much more than mere subjective feeling; the emotional response it involves is entirely secondary, and with it a vital religion has nothing to do; nor is it susceptible of a teleological explanation as serving any of the ends of life. Since, however, it is not a purely inner experience, it must ex- hibit an outer as well as an inner side. It needs expression in two directions: on the one side, in practical activity, for every concrete manifestation of the summum bonum constitutes an ideal and an inspiration to moral endeavor, hence morality, though not identical with religion, is a necessary by-product of it; on the other side, in a cult or liturgy, for man is a psycho-physical and not a purely psychical being, and the worshipper, like the artist, grasps his object fully only in the process of reproducing it.29 The nature of 25For example, Jonas Cohn, of whose position Scheler offers a detailed criticism, op. cit. 649-677. 21 Op. cit. 529-535, 550-555. "See above, p. 58I. ' Op. cit. 535-537. ' Scheler refers here to S. K. Fiedler's Vom Ursprung der kiinstlerischen Tdtigkeit, but it is evident that his view of the nature of art corresponds very closely to that defended by Alexander in his Art and the Material and in other essays.</page><page sequence="11">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 587 the worship thus varies with the aspect of the object revealed. The Roman with covered head and bended knee has a different vision of God from the Greek with eyes open and arms outstretched. But there is no unique or exclusive channel of revelation. The crudest fetich represents a realm of absolute being endowed with holiness. It is a vehicle through which this reality is grasped.30 Such ethnological facts are rightly interpreted only if we assume that men reach, in these divers ways, a stratum of being otherwise hidden, the knowledge of which is as much conditional upon the adoption of the attitude of worship as the experience of color or sound is conditional upon the use of special organs. What is given through these organs is not a product of their activity, and Absolute Being and its value, the value of the Holy, are given in a similar way to religious intuition.3 From this denial of exclusive media of revelation Scheler draws a rather unexpected inference. It is, he claims, an error derived from classical philosophy, but per- petuated in modern thought by the teaching of Kant, that reason is a constant and invariable factor in the constitution of the human race. Husserl is so far right in rejecting the Kantian doctrine of the a priori as a system of categorial functions, and ascribing a priori character to the constant features of the objective world, which re- main after abstraction of what belongs contingently to the here and now of existence, and are thus attributable to objects as such, independently of inductive proof. But-and this is Scheler's new contribution to the doctrine of the a priori-this knowledge of the constant aspects of the objective world becomes "functionalized" into a system of rules applied to contingent facts, which are cog- nized, analysed, and judged as determined by them, i.e., as sub- stantial, relational, quantitative, causal, etc. What was before an object of thought thus becomes a form of thought applicable to other objects. When, as the artist does, we apply rules that we do not formulate, these are operating as "mental functions" of this kind. It follows that there may be a real growth of human reason, both in the individual and in the race, an inference which finds empirical verification in the discovery that, if we look beyond the most formal ' See Der Formalismnus in der Ethik io8. ' Vom Ewigen im Menschen 553-558.</page><page sequence="12">588 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. principles of all, the different races of mankind do actually exhibit different developments of reason. Not only have these different groups had access to different bodies of fact, but they have appre- hended different selections of a priori laws, hence have evolved different categories of thought-a truth which is, of course, perfect- ly compatible with the validity of each such system within its range of application. Whilst, then, it is maintained that historical develop- ment is implied in the nature of knowledge, it becomes evident that the modern dogma of progress may have misrepresented the evo- lution of its higher forms. It is not necessary to assume, indeed, Scheler urges, it is not even likely, that the forms and channels of knowledge essential to the grasp of objects in the realm of the Holy belong to the human mind in the same degree in all periods. It is rather probable that, where the powers of the analytic intellect, the organ of the control and mechanical direction of nature, attain their highest development, the knowledge derived through other channels, revealing other aspects of reality, will decline, that there will be a tendency away from the knowledge of absolute towards that of rela- tive being.32 For the knowledge of God depends upon the capacity 32 Op. cit. 714. It is interesting to notice that even his repudiation of the Church's claim to be the historical repository of such knowledge did not lead Scheler to abandon the principle he here enunciates, though the im- plications of it that he emphasizes in his later writings and the language in which he couches it are very different. In a lecture delivered to the Lessing Hochschule in Berlin, January I7, I925, published posthumously in the volume, Philosophische Weltanschauung (Bonn i929), under the title Die Formen des Wissens und die Bildung, he says: "It was the great error of the eighteenth century-an error fatal to the ideal of humanity in the nineteenth-that it overlooked the growth of mind itself, i.e., of its a priori forms... . Mind grows, and of course declines-independently of biological and neurological modifications- . . . from e.g., the form of primitive men- tality (as recently described by Levy-Briihl) to the form of civilized reason applying the laws of identity and contradiction. There are changes in the ethos of a people (i.e., in its laws of preference), changes in its aesthetic appreciations and aims. There is transition from the organological view of the world, which prevailed in the West until the thirteenth century, to the mechanical view; from blood-communities to industrial societies; from magi- cal practices to positive science. These are changes of a different dimension from mere modifications of a constant reason . . . or from adaptations of the same ethos to new historical situations. . . . The process by which the knowledge of universals becomes "functionalized" or "categorialized" might be called a transformation of the matter of knowledge into the power of knowing. This implies a real growth of mind" (io6-iog). And later in the same essay: "Up to the present each of the great civilizations has pursued one type of knowledge to the exclusion of others: India religion, China and Greece culture, the West, since the beginning of the twelfth century, the technical knowledge of positive science. The moment has come for a redistribution of effort, a mutual compensation of these one-sided tendencies of the human mind. Not by the rejection of one in favor of another, nor</page><page sequence="13">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 589 of a people to receive and to preserve it.33 It cannot be wholly in- accessible to any age, but we should expect that the supreme reve- lation would be given early in the course of history rather than late, not to the wise and learned but to babes, born not among those in high places but in an ass's stall.34 This is why the great religious teachers have always striven for the restoration of true religion; they have never demanded new beginnings. It may even be that such knowledge must necessarily decline with the ageing of the human race and its absorption in a losing struggle against the forces of decay and death. In that case it would be the duty of our own and of future societies simply to preserve, reform, and revitalize what the more vigorous and productive spirit of a younger age has contributed to human life.35 The trend of life towards mechanization is simply one phase of the trend in nature towards death. Man's resources are exhausted in the struggle to maintain himself against alien forces. He cannot save himself. In place of the cheerful optimism that rejoices in humanity's unlimited powers, we need a spirit that bows the knee and looks to a higher power to raise and redeem it.-6 III The two essays which contain the gist of Scheler's later contri- bution to this subject87 may be regarded as studies for a projected work on Philosophical Anthropology, which was never completed. The larger work accomplished during this later period, Die Wis- sensformen und die Gesellschaft,"8 which occupied the years from I92I-26, is concerned chiefly with problems of sociology and social ethics, and contains only incidental discussions of metaphysics and religion.39 The essays in question are sufficient, however, to illus- trate most of the essential points of agreement and disagreement be- tween Scheler's earlier and later positions. by the exclusive cultivation of what seems historically to be characteristic of a particular civilization, but only by compensation and equalization, can the civilization of the future be maintained" (122).

It must suffice to indicate very briefly the changes in his philosophical outlook that resulted from what he himself describes as "the upheaval of his religious beliefs".40 The most noteworthy of these changes seem to be the following. (i) The greatly enhanced importance he now ascribes to human- ity, of which he retains, with some modifications, his early anti- naturalistic view; for it is significant that his anthropological re- searches, involving though they obviously did the study of a preponderance of works presenting a naturalistic view of the human species, never led him to abandon his early belief in a dif- ference of essence between man and the animal kingdom.4' What he is chiefly concerned to emphasize in this later contribution to the subject is that the old view of the psychological gulf dividing the two is no longer tenable in the light of modern research, which has demonstrated the possession by the higher animals of many characters formerly believed to be differentiae of man, e.g., the rudiments of "technical intelligence", and a power of choice not biologically determined. Thus we can only distinguish man by a different set of characters, which Scheler calls his "ascetic func- tions", viz., the determination of his actions by the object instead of exclusively by his own impulses and appetites, which raises him above mere interaction with a changing environment to the know- ledge of a world; a love for this world that is free from the taint of desire, or the appetite for mere "things"-an emotion exhibited at its highest in Spinoza's amor intellectualis, or in Bruno's heroic love that transcends mere animal enjoyment to embrace conflict and pain ;42 above all, his power to distinguish the what of an ob- ject from its that, and, by the inhibition of desires and motor- tendencies directed towards existents, to discover truths concern- ing essence that are a priori, and thus valid for all instances, and to evaluate between values without reference to concrete goods.43 This last capacity of concept-building (Ideierung) Scheler con- 'See Preface to Die Wissensformen und die Gesellschaft viii. 4' Cf. the view outlined in the essay, Die Idee des Menschen (first pub- lished in 1915), included in Vom Umsturz der Werte (Third Edition Leip- zig 1923) I. 4' See Philosophische Weltanschauung, essay on Spinoza 136-137. 4' Die Formen des Wissens und die Bildung 99-ioi; see also Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos 47-68.</page><page sequence="15">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 591 siders the characteristic activity of man, or, as he once calls it, "his true differentia, from which all his other specific qualities fol- low", and he is fond of repeating that the knowledge thus attained fulfills the double function of furnishing an a priori basis for sci- ence and, in the words of Hegel, "opening windows to the Abso- lute."144 (2) It was a doctrine already implied in his Probleme der Re- ligion45 that the efficacy and vitality of any grade of being are in inverse ratio to its value, that the higher values have thus, unless reinforced from an external source, no power of self-maintenance, much less of expansion or propagation. At first, as we have seen, this conviction had seemed to him to point to the necessity of salva- tion by a higher power, but it is obvious that to a mind unbiased by theological presuppositions it might suggest a very different infer- ence. "The creative force or efficacy that is the source of all existing things with their contingent characters flows", he now declares, "from lower to higher". He cites as illustration the relative inde- pendence exhibited by lower forms of being, e.g., by the plant, as contrasted with the animal or man which cannot, for their part, sub- sist except in dependence on the vegetable kingdom. Of all the species man, the most complex in organization, is the most de- pendent on other forms of life, and this is again true of the choicer 44Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos 62. See also the title-essay of Philosophische Weltanschauung 8. The same statement occurs repeatedly in his students' lecture-notes, several series of which have been kindly lent me by Professor Howard Becker of Smith College, Northampton, Mass. 5 See Vom EAigem im Menschen 5T5; also Das Ressentiment im Aufbau der Moralen, included in Vom Umsturz der Werte I 225 ad finem. These passages seem to have been overlooked by Nikolai Hartmann, who criticizes Scheler for defending the opposite principle. (See his Ethics, English Translation [New York, 1932] II 27.) It must be admitted that Scheler's position in the work to which Hartmann refers (Der Formalismus in der Ethik) is not unambiguous. Whilst he declares in the passage criticized (p. 92) that values which condition others are higher than those conditioned, e.g., the value of the pleasant than that of the useful, which is clearly deriva- tive from it, or the value of vital function than that of the pleasant, he afterwards lays it down as a basic principle of morals that all positive values that can be realized by impersonal mechanical forces should be so realized in order that personal effort may be reserved for the realization of the higher goods that normally depend upon the existence of the lower (526). It is uncertain whether he was influenced towards his later position by the criticism of his younger contemporary. Certainly he quotes with ap- proval Hartmann's statement that "the higher categories both of being and value are incontrovertibly the weaker", and there is an unmistakable parallelism in their treatments of this law, though Hartmann is more cautious in the metaphysical conclusions that he draws from it.</page><page sequence="16">592 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. and more gifted human souls in relation to the masses of mankind. Beauty is a frail flower, short-lived and rare. The higher forms of being do not arise, nor do they maintain themselves, by their own powers but by the powers of the lower. It was the cardinal error of "the classical theory"-be it in the original Greek, the Christian, or the Hegelian form-that it attributed motivating force to "the Idea", thereby implying that the universe is so constituted that the forms which are highest in value or significance possess great- est power or efficacy. The vitalist, or idealist, interpretation of the world is no more acceptable than the opposite mechanist or ma- terialist theory, which derives the higher forms genetically from the lower.46 (3) Doubtless in reaction against his own defence of it in his earlier works, Scheler is particularly concerned to dispute the form assumed by the classical theory in Christian theism, which repre- sents the world as the product of a creative will that fashions it upon a preconceived design (or, as in Augustinian Platonism, "after the pattern of the Ideas"). The native impotence of those modes of being that are highest in significance and value implies, he points out, the native impotence of mind. If force is originally the exclusive possession of lower grades of being, then this ele- mental force must be blind. It is the blind urge, opposed to reason, misnamed by Schopenhauer Will. The factors in the universe ex- hibiting the most inherent force are the centers of energy of the inorganic world, whose motions, it is now generally admitted, are subject to no law and present a merely statistical uniformity. It is only by a process accurately described by the Freudian term, "sublimation", that the more highly organized forms of being come to participate in this energy, in other words, by the placing of the powers of a lower stratum at the disposal of a higher. In this way the forces at play among electrons are made of service to the structure of the atom, those of the inorganic world are utilized for the ends of life. Man, with his enormous consumption of energy in brain-activity, is the climax of this process of sublimation, its goal being the transformation of blind impulse into intelligent ac- tion.47 A principle that applies to the whole course of nature, how- ever, must apply equally to the Supreme Being that is its im- 'Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos 74-77. 47 Op. cit. 78-79.</page><page sequence="17">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 593 manent ground. If we ascribe to it the two attributes of Mind and Force, we see that it is to the latter that the flux of contingent being is due; for Mind, though doubtless the character in virtue of which we assign godhead to the Ens a se, possesses no positive creative power. Only by utilizing the creative power of the blind world- force can the essences and values potential in mind be realized in the temporal course of the world-process. "The interpenetration of originally impotent mind and force originally demonic (i.e., blind to value), through which force is spiritualized and mind vitalized and made effective, is the end and goal of all finite being and be- coming. It is the error of theism to make it the starting-point."48 The true role of mind in the universe is not creative. To it belongs the more modest function of controlling the originally blind energy, releasing it in one direction and checking it in another, by present- ing to it images of the ends that will fulfill its values and ideals and setting in abeyance those representing conflicting objects of desire.49 The world-process, so far as this has meaning, exhibits the two at- tributes in interdependence, for "mind without force is empty, force without mind is blind", though Scheler admits that much of the course of history consists in an interplay of the blind forces of heredity, environment, mob-feeling, etc., and that the amount of intelligent direction it receives at any time is no more than a frac- tion of what is theoretically possible. 50 (4) There is obviously a close connection between the above view and von Hartmann's attempt at a synthesis of Schopenhauer's Will with Hegel's Idea, with which, however, he found actual exist- ence inconsistent, describing it therefore as a Fall, having its source in a volition wholly blind, from which redemption could only be effected through the quelling of the forces of life. Scheler does not discuss the relation of this theory, which he had formerly rejected,51 to his own, but it is impossible that he can have been unaware of the parallel between them, and it is perhaps for this reason that he lays so much emphasis upon the conclusion he finally reaches, which exhibits an optimism concerning human destiny that is in striking contrast both to von Hartmann's pessimism and to his own '8Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos 82-83. 49 Op. cit. 72-73. 6 Die Formen des Wissens und die Bildung I05. "' See Vom Ewigen im Menschen 498.</page><page sequence="18">594 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIIIL former rather gloomy prognostications as to the fate of the human race. As a result of his enhanced confidence in the value and effectiveness of humanity he is now prepared, in renouncing the theistic doctrine of creation, to renounce with it the hope of re- demption by a higher power. Man, he declares, is his own savior-nay, he is more, for in saving himself by holding in check, and bringing under the control of reason, the demonic forces of passion and appetite, he is realizing God. Prior to this interpene- tration of the attributes, which takes place only in man and through his deliberate endeavor, there is no Godhead, but only an indeter- minate ground of being and a realm of forms or essences possess- ing no dynamic power of self-realization. Man and God are mutual- ly dependent, for man could not be called to such a task did he not consciously partake of both attributes of the Supreme Be- ing; but neither, without man, could the Supreme Being exhibit the character of godhead.52 Man is a microcosm, but he is also a "microtheos"; for God is not a substance, and cannot be known as an object, as a thing is known. We know God, as we know the self, only as we live in Him, participating in His acts. It must not, however, be forgotten that force is as much an attribute of the Supreme Being as mind, and that it is in the interpenetration of the two that deity is realized. Man's instinctive and emotional life is as much rooted in God, therefore, as his rational being, a fact of which we become aware, Scheler tells us, in our deeper experiences of cosmic sympathy and love. Man is not merely the servant, or even the child of God. He is co-creator with God, for his is the decisive role in the world's course. He marches in the vanguard of the cosmic battle, bearing himself the banner of godhead.53 (5) It is perhaps salutary to be reminded at this point that the function through which man fulfills his divine mission is neverthe- less an ascetic one. It is only by saying nay to the elemental forces of animal existence that he is able to develop his rational nature, and -thereby to energize the latent resources of Eternal Mind. This, Scheler holds, is the metaphysical significance of Husserl's "phe- nomenological reduction", or "bracketing" of the moment of exist- ence, which was wrongly represented by its author as effected 'Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos IIO-II2. Philosophische Anschauung Ii-12.</page><page sequence="19">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 595 through the suspension of the judgment of existence. For, once more, reality is apprehended not through judgment or any other intellectual process, but through the experience of resistance to volition, or to the exercise of force. It can only be negated, there- fore, by setting out of commission the centres of instinct and vital force.54 Thus reduction is more than a philosophical method; it is a technique, needing discipline and practice to acquire. The ground of this reaction against the intellectualism of the earlier phenomenologists will be clear from what has already been said. Man can only control and direct the vital forces of his being, Scheler holds, by inhibiting certain of his tendencies in order to- release for other functions the energy they normally absorb. In other words, he must "sublimate" this energy by deflecting it from its original course and appropriating it to higher mental functions, or, in physiological terms, by utilizing it in the development of brain at the expense of other parts of the organism. It is the specific task of philosophy, Scheler claims, to effect this sublimation. Science aims at control of the forces of nature for the ends of life. Philoso- phy, on the other hand, seeks a knowledge of objects that are not "relative to life", i.e., that serve no biological ends. It has thus to lay aside all such practical interests, to set in abeyance the ordinary tendencies of desire.5,5 What he has failed to make sufficiently clear is the exact relation that human reason acquires through this ascetic function to that Mind which is an attribute of the World-Ground, and is thus eternally subsistent, albeit requiring the motive-power of the other attribute to bring it into spatio-temporal existence. That the original status of such Mind is that of Aristotle's purely potential being seems evident, yet he is emphatic in rejecting Hus- serl's "classical" doctrine of essence, by which he had once been profoundly influenced,56 but which now falls under the same con- demnation as the whole rationalist tradition with which it is as- sociated. Essences or forms are, he repeats several times, neither ante res nor in rebus, but rather cum rebus. The Platonism inherited by Christianity from Augustine implied a prevision of the order of existence and creation according to this design.

Ideas are only produced in the Eternal Mind in the act of their reali- zation in the world-process, so that our concept-building is not simply the discovery of a realm of essences that are independent of our minds but rather an actual participation in bringing them to birth out of the womb of eternal being.57 The universal and the particular are aspects of one reality; they cannot, indeed, be ap- prehended together, since they involve different mental attitudes, but they form ontologically an indissoluble unity. If, however, there are no essences ante res, it is difficult to see what can be the nature or content of the Mind that is an Attribute of Eternal Being and therefore itself ante res. Even mere potenti- ality must be the potentiality of something, and it is not clear from the foregoing account what is potential in Mind, if not essence or form, since existence has a different origin. Scheler is doubtless right in resisting the temptation to hypostatize essence, but it would be easy to show by reference to his works that Husserl is not guilty of this hypostasis, which he himself seems to be able to avoid only by postulating a mind that is prior to its objects, a false abstraction that he would ordinarily be the first to deprecate. (6) It will be so obvious after all this as to need little emphasis that the belief in revelation as a mode of knowledge distinguish- able from the independent achievements of the intellect in science or metaphysics has now been completely abandoned. If God can- not be known as an object, there can be no intuition of a Being Absolute and Holy, and the nature of the relationship between human and divine here described clearly renders impossible the re- ception of knowledge by communication. Scheler does not discuss this point in any detail, but he several times criticizes the claim to authority of bodies of dogma regarded as revealed truth, the source of which he traces to the disastrous tendency to deify the founder of a religion.5, The position that accords best with his new view is closely related to the Positivism he had been wont to criticize.59 Religion, he says at the close of his last essay, precedes metaphysics in the history of the race. In the period of his im- maturity man's need of protection and support is so great as to over- 6 Die Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos 59-60. 5 See especially Die Wissensformen und die Gesellschaft I 74-76. " See Vom Ewigen im Menschen 344 ff.; also Der Formalismus in der Ethik, passim.</page><page sequence="21">No. 6.] MAX SCHELER ON RELIGION 597 come all the doubts and scruples of reflection or logic, and his powers of imagery and fantasy enable him to people his world with beings of supernatural qualities and powers, in whom he finds a refuge from the loneliness resulting from his divorce from the realm of nature, which his conceptual activity has transformed from an environment almost continuous with his animal being into a realm of objects over against him. But it is not his purpose, Scheler declares, to give assurance to weaklings who need external support. In the early stages of his development man is not likely to realize his responsibility for, and cooperation in, the evolution of Deity. But he will gradually learn to associate himself with the acts of the God- head and participate in its being and its life, substituting for the attitude of contemplation or worship the active identification of himself with the world-process (creatio continua) as its medium of fulfilment, of conscious self-realization.60 Whether Scheler believes this to be a true account of his own development to philosophical maturity is not quite certain. What is most significant in it is his volte-face from his early champion- ship of the Greek or mediaeval ideal of contemplation as the en- joyment of goods that are ends in themselves, in opposition to the practical activity that is concerned with the production of things that are primarily means, to a glorification of action as a living in, and working with, a world-process that is an apparently in- finite temporal flux. That this is completely in harmony with the outlook of an age where both in science and in philosophy the static viewpoint has given place to the dynamic, and the active life finds few rivals, cannot be denied-indeed one is tempted to wonder how far it was the influence of the Zeitgeist upon a mind unusu- ally receptive of ideas that caused this change of front. Whether, on the other hand, such a change is indisputably an advance, or whether the abandonment of the contemplative for the active ideal may not involve a loss in the power of insight and reflective judg- ment for which there is no compensatory gain, is a question which, as Mill might remind us, only he can decide who has had experi- ence of both.
