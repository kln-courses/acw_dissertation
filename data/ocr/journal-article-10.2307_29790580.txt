<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS AN EXISTENTIALIST CONCEPT OF "AMERICAN CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY: ON DEATH, TRICKSTER AND SOCRATES" Martin Blobel Martin Blobel is Lecturer of Political Philosophy at the Free University of Berlin. Literary Theory in Current Anthropology Since the eighties a new theoretical and methodical trend has become dominant in American cultural anthropology. In an influential paper, Clifford Geertz observed: "Analogies drawn from the humanities are coming to play the kind of role in sociological understanding that analogies drawn from the crafts and technology have long played in physical understanding."1 The implication here is not so much anthropology's older reception of linguistics and symbolic interactionism (which Geertz presented earlier) but rather the integration of literary hermeneutics. "Literary criticism and interpretation . . . replaced linguistics as an influential source of new ideas about theory and method in anthropology,"2 according to a critical history of American anthropology by G. E. Marcus and M. J. Fischer, which can be seen as a platform for the new research trend. Thus, "literary" writing or "artistic textuality" (in contrast to "scientific prose") and "aesthetic reason" (instead of, or at least alongside, "transcendental reason") are stressed in the renewal if cultural anthropology. This concept of literary cognition is modern, subjectivistic and negativistic; irony is among its preferred stylistic means. "Literary texts (are) deemed to be . . . allegorical, composed of inventions rather than observed facts: they allow a wide latitude to the emotions, speculations ... of their authors . . . (they) play on the stratification of meaning; (they) narrate one thing in order to tell something else. . . . This discourse, repeatedly banished from science ... is incurably . . . polysemous,"3 explains James Clifford Dialectical Anthropology 23: 307-335, 1998. ? 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</page><page sequence="2">308 who, as a historian of literature, is currently an influential interpreter of anthropological texts. In keeping with this leading idea, current social anthropology explores by hermeneutical means the semantical (historical) contexts of cultural interaction as well as of analytical, scientific predicaments. "There is a need for a new philologist?specialist in contextual relations?in all areas of knowledge in which text building ... is a central activity: literature, history, law, music, politics . . . "4 In well-known social "texts" readings like these show unique, context-related meanings, and also, which is very important, all kinds of ambiguity and contradicting loyalties. This goes for unique actions (which are subject to ethnographical description), but also for "identical" scientific concepts (which are concerned as elements of more complex texts?two different cultures, for example). The intention of the new anthropology is?in a word recollection: recollections of passed, namely context-related, significance of analytically isolated structures and statements: recollection of transitoriness as a parameter of scientifically ascertained truth: recollection of the historical complexity of human experience which is denied in the scientific idea of knowledge; recollection of the ambiguity of every decision. In other words: recollection of the "mythical" law that all gestures of human activity and cognition are in vain; in the last resort, recollection of everything outlawed, lost or perished through modernity, of the dead as such. These intentions of recollection point to a certain field of research, which is discussed in the new anthropological literature. I mean the historical and political reinterpretation of America's anthropological science. In his relatively recent publication, Geertz "blurred the boundary separating art from science,"5 aiming at the reinvestigation of social anthropology's knowledge: Geertz looks at "The Anthropologist as Author,"6 in order to disclose and understand the biographical, political, etc., contexts that co determine scientific production, which are reflected by it and upon which it reacts. These contexts can be clearly traced in anthropological texts, but are suppressed in a conventional reading, since such reading searches for "lasting,' "objective" insights, that</page><page sequence="3">309 "scientific" texts are supposed to offer. If, instead, one faces the ambiguity of a unique experience, or if one takes the "scientific" as a literary text, the critical reinterpretation can recollect the complex semantics of the anthropological encounter with the other. For the same reason, Stephen Greenblatt?the major representative of "new historicism" in literary theory?wrote a history of the texts recorded by the discoverers of America entitled Marvelous Possessions.1 Instead of outlining the progress of ethnographic knowledge towards greater exactitude, Greenblatt explores the traces left in the texts and styles of ethnography by the "amazement" of the discoverer at a form of experience that confronts Self and Other in an uncommonly thick and polysemous way. This amazement has a political significance: "In popular imagery the ethnographer has shifted from a sympathetic, authoritative observer ... to (an) unflattering figure. . . . Ethnographic work has indeed been enmeshed in a world of enduring and changing power inequalities, and it continues to be implicated. It enacts power relations. But its function within these relations is complex, often ambivalent, potentially counter hegemonic."8 More remarkable still: both Geertz and Greenblatt reinterpret particularly moderm, scientific writing on the premodern, precolumbian America of the Indians. Put another way, they recollect, by means of literary interpretation, the outlawed and lost elements especially of the American culture area, and they revise the ways in which these elements were previously handed down. They make a contribution to what "American cultural anthropology" really ought to do: acquaint American scientific modernity with its premodern background. In the American context, I discern a substantial political relevance in the new methodological trend in anthropology. A Teleological Explication of American Anthropology Social anthropology is the modern science of man's life in other, or very old patterns of culture. In this respect American cultural</page><page sequence="4">310 anthropology can only be the research of the culture of the native Indian people. Indeed, American anthropology, since its beginnings with Lewis Henry Morgan in 1860, turns towards the Indian tribes. However, a wider documentation of the Indian cultures of North and South America does not occur until Franz Boas, the founder of American cultural anthropology. The fact that Boas did not take this step until the beginning of the twentieth century, at a time when the vanishing of undisturbed primitive culture from North America was nearly complete, demonstrates the course taken by colonial history and the process of civilization on the North American continent. Alexis de Tocqueville, the eminent French analyst of American democracy, inquired into how Americans were treating the premodern traditions of their continent. Tocqueville described the Indians and whites of Jacksonian America as two opposed cultural blocks, unable to lend wings to each other.9 Instead, they shared exploitative relations: the Indian culture, to pick up a more recent term, has long since become a peripheral appendage of the expanding capitalism of the United States; hybrids of both races are miscarriages, since the capitalistic civilization slowly breaks up the primitive culture and destroys it, at length. "It is impossible to destroy man with more respect for the laws of humanity,"10 Tocqueville concludes and throws a spotlight on the modern anthropological concept influential in North America that had eliminated all premodern elements of the anthropos from his civilized idea. Tocqueville's clear-cut message to the Indians was simple: "The Indians must either destroy the Europeans or become their equals."11 Hannah Arendt describes the political anthropology of American democracy that sealed the fate of the Indian culture as follows: "The superior wisdom of the American founders in theory and practice is conspicuous and impressive enough, and yet has never carried with it sufficient persuasiveness and plausibility to prevail in the tradition of revolution . . . since . . . they found it easy to think of passion in terms of desire and to banish from it any connotation of its original meaning, which is pathein, to suffer and to endure. This lack of experience gives their theories, even if they are sound, an air of</page><page sequence="5">311 lightheartedness, a certain weightlessness, which may well put into jeopardy their durability. For, humanly speaking, it is endurance which enables man to create durability and continuity. Their thought did not carry them any further than to the point of understanding government in the image of individual reason and construing the rule of government over the governed, according to the age-old model of the rule of reason over the passions. To bring the 'irrationality' of desires and emotions under the control of rationality was, of course, a thought dear to Enlightenment, and as such was quickly found wanting in many respects, especially in its facile and superficial equation of thought with reason and of reason with rationality."12 My thesis is that the contemporary anthropology inspired by literary theory is nourished by the enduring finding that "thought . . . (is) wanting in many respects." In this respect, contemporary anthropology shakes the foundation of modern, civilized anthropology (Enlightenment) and especially of North American civilization. And it does so while rediscovering the complexity of primitive Indian culture. Finally, that through bringing together these various determinations, it is revitalizing what in a significant meaning could be named the telos of American cultural anthropology. Because "pathein, . . . endurance which enables man to create durability and continuity" is precisely what the integration of literary theory into social anthropology really means: the mentioned "recollection" as a means of "aesthetic reason" is this "pathein." The return of "pathein" in America occurs in consideration of the Indian cultures in general, and especially the cultures of South America. Voluminous documentations on long-gone Sioux cultures were recently brought to light for the first time, and James Clifford welcomes them as useful material to literary reinterpretation of anthropological textuality.13 The literary critic Jery Zaslove reports that the subject "'memory and modernity'" is a big hit among Latin American specialists" today.14 Moreover, the "postmodern" literary critics in particular turn their attention to the Latin American cultures.15 It seems as if the reintegration of the pathein into civilized anthropology in America cannot be separated from the memory of colonial history of the continent, when these premodern</page><page sequence="6">312 elements were put under taboo and the Indian culture, in which they play a major part, was destroyed. The newly awakened interest for Latin America as a culture area is based on the circumstance that the colonization of the southern subcontinent, which was dominated by Catholic Spaniards, in fact took place in a very cruel manner but finally, in its work of destruction was less successful than the Protestant civilization of the North.16 Current attention in North America is based on the reevaluation of this circumstance: the South American area represents the case of a civilization process which was able to integrate premodern elements?all the Indian tribes and cultures?in manifold ways. That is why the primitive-modern syncretism of Latin America is the preferred subject of "American cultural anthropology" today. This is most apparent in the motive of (literary) memory, the pathein itself. For mourning and the cult of the dead, even death as such are the embodiment of passionate memory. And it fits into my conception that attitudes toward death vary enormously in North and South America. The civilized of the North?according to the advocates of the "death denial" thesis17?have met with death only as meaningless fact, as a sickness, that is not even exactly definable in medical science and, unfortunately, still incurable.18 This attitude also characterizes the typical view of South America in the social sciences. Up to now, the scientific mainstream of American social anthropology understands death as meaningless and faces dying only as a challenge to the abstract function of social reproduction which is imagined as deathless?see the mainstream's "classic paper," by David G. Mandelbaum.19 Accordingly, the main perception of primitive cults of the dead is as a means to compensate for the loss and to repel the threat of death, in short: to undo death culturally. Loss of memory, denial of death and scientific functionalism combine into a compound which tells us more about the modern civilized attitude toward death than about attitudes in South America. For there, death occupies the center of public life: "The Mexican frequents death, makes fun of it, caresses it ... it is one of his favorite games and his deepest love," reports Octavio Paz20 from Mexico, and explains: "Death is a mirror which reflects the vain</page><page sequence="7">313 gesticulations of the living. . . . Death defines life ... we do not change except to disappear."21 According to this, death appears as the homestead of vanity, as the eternal form in which life passes. As such, it is more significant than life. Life has to be won from death, its alluring and threatening omnipresence. Consequently, "playing" with death is a typical Latin American mode. Carlos Fuentes, another Mexican writer, summarizes the idea of his country's cultural attitude towards death: "In contrary to the European concept of death as finitude, we see in death the beginning. We all are children of death."22 Indeed, in Mexico one meets a complete philosophy of death as origin, which reaches far back into the Indian Religion. Fuentes continues, on Frida Kahlo's art: "Frida had a way to make a fool of death, to play around with it. She used her faculty of speech and gave names to death. "23 In these aspects of the Mexican death cults, motifs recur that are the cultural focus of the literary trend in social anthropology mentioned above: futility, transitoriness, and ambiguity. Moreover, ritualized recollection, "the naming," paralleled, for example, by the repetitive reading of the ethnographic literature. But not only the reinterpretative recollection of its own attitude towards the Indians is an important theme in current anthropology. Rather, Indian cultures and Latin American colonial history, which are remembered thereby, themselves keep at hand the whole primitive explanation of death and the arts of memory trained in the primitive cults of the dead. Thus, Latin American death cults correspond as uncommonly rich material, with the intention of the new literary-inspired anthropology to recollect the premodern pathein. Secondary literature on death as a theme in postmodern writing already exists.24 What sounds more promising than to research where death is situated at the center of cultural life? Therefore, as I believe, it is most important to observe what is written on the primitive-modern death cults of Latin America in the cultural anthropology of the North. In choosing this subject, the literary-influenced anthropology fulfills its special determination as American anthropology. Whether or not social anthropology's turn to death in South America really is significant to American anthropology's telos can only be answered by an examination of the insights discovered by</page><page sequence="8">314 this new trend in the research. Circumspection in adopting the trend seems to be appropriate, since in Western civilization it is much the fashion nowadays to mourn for something or someone, and this can easily cloud discernment. Andreas Huyssen has mentioned the fleeting transitions between "monument" and "monumentalism"25 in contemporary mass culture as well as in the avant garde in America and Europe. Huyssen makes some skeptical remarks: the new trend could be simply an "inflation of memory,"26 and yet pathologically obsessed by apocalyptical themes, as was monumentalism in previous instances (Huyssen mentions the romantic Richard Wagner). Or is it, after all, a recollection that really is able to open up modernity to premodernity and the theme of death that is so important in the latter? These questions are not easy to answer. The new social anthropology works by means of literary criticism on the difficulties of recollection. By next discussing net the problems of this literature, I hope to contribute some clarification to the problem of modernity and premodernity, as well as to the concept of Amerian anthropology.27 The Simultaneousness of the Uncontemporaneous as a Problem for Anthropological Theory Current American anthropology particularly connects to two important concepts from literary theory. I mean the romantic and modern aesthetics and the primitive and archaic concept of mimesis. Literary Hermeneutics "Literary theory" in anthropology means, first of all, that literary hermeneutics sprouts in all directions: Unchained from functionalism and the analysis of the capitalistic world system, "postmodern" ethnography dedicates itself to the expression of the subjective experience of the ethnographer with the other culture. By this, one hopes for surprising explorations28 and to set free the innovative power which is inherent in comparative cultural studies.29 By means of the boundlessness of romantic hermeneutics, the new</page><page sequence="9">315 anthropology is radically taking up a demand raised in the sixties by George Devereux, who did field work in America: that the anthropologist should pay great attention to his personal affective involvement in the encounter with the "Other"; even more, that he should use his involvement as a guide to research and understand its thorough study as an important part of his work.30 Marcus and Fischer demonstrate that the exploration of the subjectivity and individuality of the "Others" is a promising subject for anthropological theory that remained undiscovered until the advent of the recent literature.31 According to Devereux, a kind of "law" can be established that such research cannot be successful unless the anthropologist takes his own subjectivity in the research process seriously. By means of enforced analysis of particular and micro structures, idiosyncratic subjectivity is to be "saved" for cultural anthropology. "In these fields longstanding commitments to general, totalizing systems of theory are suspended for the sake of intimately representing and valorizing difference and diversity in the face of widespread perceptions of an increasingly homogenized world. Our interest here is how cultural critique in anthropology, stimulated by the spirit of experimentation in its traditional arenas, might cut into this fashion and contribute something distinctive and valuable."32 Here is doubtless a significant insight that has often been sadly missing in social anthropology: namely, the fact that man is free as a natural being and, as such, an absolute dissident. "Man's nature seems to be human through and through and, measured against natura naturans, denatured. . . . With man there comes a tear in nature, something questionable and ambiguous, insufficient and vain, the 'negative power of the spirit,'33 ... a 'hole' in the whole of the objective being.'34" Accordingly, cultural anthropology is urged to take into consideration man's negativity much more than it has done so far. For example, man's life should no longer be functionally reified in a Malinowskian manner to supposed "basic needs." Moreover, man's negativity has a strong cultural representation in Latin America, no less than romantic hermeneutics (allegorism). Both themes of romanticism are present in the baroque culture that has been influential in Latin American, and particularly Brazil.35 When anthropology studies Latin American cultures, it</page><page sequence="10">316 should be on a par with its subject and should not fall short with positivistic approaches. On the other hand, the problems of romantic hermeneutics are obvious and well-known. They all return in the difficulties of romantic-modern anthropology. In the first place, its methodical subjectivism can lead to a reduction to individualistic viewpoints. This results in an impoverished picture of the other culture by reproducing particularly the pattern of individualism in Western democracy. This highlights a main problem of hermeneutics: its radical subjectivism is also a modernism and very much a part of modern civilization. Hermeneutics, often praised for its innovative power, paradoxically proves itself as surrendering to a spell of its own culture. Moreover, such subjectivism can entangle itself in utter aestheticism, in that death threatens all at once both everywhere and nowhere. By the way, the current "memorial mania"36 has a predecessor in the fascination with myths among the romantics. Here, modern subjectivity is ambiguously bound up in the mythical. Put another way, the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous is inherent in hermeneutics. Certainly, this reality is not sufficiently considered in heremeneutical subjectivism. Geertz underlines that the hermeneutical anthropologist's subjectivism can reduce awareness of the "us-them-situation" when in cultural anthropology, a human being molded by the prejudices of one culture undertakes to research and write on a rather different, other culture with all the related difficulties. Geertz has criticized such incapability to handle the us-them-situation (the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous) in the works of Vincent Crapanzano, an admitted representative of the new hermeneutical anthropology.37 The history of the discipline easily shows how often the others have been used simply as a projection screen of current meaning. This might be legitimate, but has little relevance to cultural anthropology and the cognitive power of comparative cultural studies. As a method in American cultural anthropology hermeneutics is significant because of its innovative power, but the limits of its usefulness should be clearly recognized.</page><page sequence="11">317 When American representatives of hermeneutical anthropology reflect on the scientific status of their work they are likely to refer to Hans-Georg Gadamer's Truth and Method? Thus, one can cite from this book in order to demonstrate the cognitive horizon of the literature concerned. According to Gadamer, hermeneutics provide a relativistic understanding without ambitions to tell the truth. "The truth of the corrective," is its business.39 It represents the abstract negativity of man. In general, "the hermeneutical reflection is limited to the detection of cognitive possibilities that would not be perceived without it. But in itself, it obtains no criterion of truth."40 But there is a need for such a criterion?as a primary counterpart to hermeneutical negativity, in order to develop the latter's abilities. This does not necessarily imply an immediate succumbing to the concept of "determined negation,"41 but the recognition of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous?a modern hermeneutics implying an initial public or community. Reflection on the ambiguity inherent in hermeneutics is necessary. But as far as I can see, this reflection is not undertaken intensely enough in existing literature.42 The simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous in anthropological hermeneutics is denied by itself?with the probable result of succumbing to it even more unwarily. Mimesis The second approach to be found in current anthropology crystallizes around the term "mimesis." "The mimetical element that, in fact, is indispensable in art, is substantially linked with generality,"43 Theodor Adorno wrote. On account of this substantial relation to generality, mimesis is different from romantic subjectivism. The concept relates back to the primitive and archaic world and there it means, as Benjamin points out,44 the ritualistic imitation of the primary cosmical order in a dancer's empirical body, in a village's empirical life, etc. Obviously, the cult of the dead is a major field of mimetic activity. As a concept, mimesis emerges in Greek aesthetics. There, works of art, like other technai, were understood as an integral part of society, and in reverse, they were expected to be an imitation of the public (religious and</page><page sequence="12">318 metaphysical, but also the political) properties providing social reproduction in an actor's gesture, a judge's decision etc.45 With the ritual element of mimesis now appears a political and empirical element, in other words, a modern and civilized one. The simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous is intrinsic in mimesis and it would be worth studying how this was accomplished in Greek thought. That archaic concept of mimesis persists in cultural anthropology: "The anthropology of classical antiquity is booming in many countries' current archeology."46 Of major significance in such American anthropology today is Latin American specialist Michael Taussig's work, for example, his Mimesis and Alterity41 (Earlier: such differing scholars as Stanley Diamond and Kenneth Burke). There can be no doubt about the relevance of the concept in Latin America, although the idea of compactness and substantial unanimity of mimetical realization of the origins appears to be problematical. This idea implies the existence of virginal primitive or archaic cultures and this condition, as everybody knows, is almost nonexistent anymore. Moreover, such a concept would miss the particularity of Latin America, its cultural syncretism. Claude Levi Strauss would have argued for sure that the concept of mimesis had been losing its subject in the course of the advance of civilization in the twentieth century. That seems to be true at least insofar as mimesis is obviously in crisis nowadays. Octavio Paz has argued that the mimetic feast of the dead has become sterile and lost the capability to give the fertility once possessed by the Aztec feasts, to which they are related.48 Thus, simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous can be seen in Latin American forms of mimesis too. In American cultural anthropology, there are writers who completely abandon the concept of ritualistic mimesis. Instead, they try to secularize mimesis as an explanation of the individual within the totality of society. This is where anthropological analysis and critique of the imperialistic world system belongs as developed mainly in the sixties, namely by Eric R. Wolf. "One way I can think of to accomplish this is to engage ourselves in the systematic writing of a history of the modern world in which we spell out the process</page><page sequence="13">319 of power which created the present-day cultural systems and linkages between them."49 The problem of this kind of analysis is that beneath an idea of the public, which has now achieved the global dimension and operates clearly in a manner of domination,50 the individual, who is meant to imitate it substantially, can only be grasped as a "moment" in the process of the whole. Thereby, already on the level of terminology, the individual is crushed, or petrified beneath the power of the origins. This style of analysis does not reconstruct mimesis in its practical sense as mediation between the particular and the general, rather it looks like a negative theory of civilization, which is rejected by the concept of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous no less than its positive counterpart. The attempt to "secularize" mimesis in a radical manner paradoxically ends up in a new form of "primeval" subjugation under the origin. Mimesis does not simply mean "the public generality," but its imitation in single actions. By means of substantial mimesis, the general is seen in a new light. Reproduction without variation always was rather an exceptional case of mimesis. Whether the capitalist world system does not allow anything else than such a reproduction is surely an important question. But it is another thing to deny other possibilities a priori by terminologial predecisions. In this case, the question of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous cannot even be raised anymore. The new hermeneutical subjectivism protests against this tendency in anthropology. In the awareness of such difficulties, a new literature on mimesis has recently developed. Here, the term is no longer used in the purely "secularized" form. Taussig inquires into death religions in Colombia and, like Paz, he observes deep-reaching changes from the pre-Colombia culture, but he does not appraise them necessarily as destructions.51 The uncontemporaneous colonialistic "disturbances" of the cult of the dead become, according to Taussig, themselves subject to Indian' mimetic activity. Consequently, meanings are constructed that are no longer primitive. Rather, they imitate the civilized structures in order to bring the old rituals to an altered conclusion of altogether intrinsic value. Where before it was the long-standing relation to the Indian realm of the dead that ritually</page><page sequence="14">320 regulated the pathein of the living, and where Paz now sees decay, Taussig discerns an assimilation of the Christian concept of redemption for the now remaining "undead"?souls of the Indians. The power of the old fatalistic pathein is linked up with the idea of modernity, according to Taussig, who is strongly influenced by the concept of mimesis worked out be his predecessor, Walter Benjamin. Taussig's concept amounts to the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous. And, what is particularly important, this simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous is in itself subject to the anthropologist's reflection and appropriation. According to Taussig, it is true that altered Colombian cults of the dead remain in the ambiguity of Mexican Mestizo culture that was classified by Fuentes as "baroque, syncretistic, unsatisfied."52 But to emphasize that means also to present these cults as open and in need of further discussion. The "undead" are no longer mythically segregated and they surely are not modern without any refractions, rather they are located between the two worlds. And, as such, they become subject, according to Taussig. The review of current anthropological literature demonstrates that, in anthropological experience, hermeneutics and mimesis, modern subjectivism and primitive archaic imitatio of the origin, penetrate each other. Mimesis is in hermeneutics and vice versa. The interpenetration of the two concepts was mentioned also in Latin America?for example, by the Brazilian literary scholar Luiz Costa Lima, who has taught in the U.S.A. for a long time.53 Mimesis and hermeneutics remain different, but one can conclude that in the tension between them an experience is taking shape that is correctly signified as simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous. The methodical ambiguities of an anthropology inspired by literary theory have a parallel in the syncretism of the modern-premodern cultures of Latin America. In every respect, they point towards the center of my above outline. What American anthropology substantially is can be seen more clearly in the question of mimesis and romanticism. But the decisive interpretive criterion must read as follows: Do anthropological theories face the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous directly?as their task no less than that of the "Others?" Or do they only subjugate themselves to it in their</page><page sequence="15">321 detailed "blind" manner? Taussig's writings are an important reference in this questioning of interpretation. Mainstream The mainstream of social anthropology has nothing to say about these problems, which itself tells us a great deal. Its silence must be read as symptomatic of the denial of the reality of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous. The book by Richard Huntington and Peter Metcalf, Celebration of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual,5* appears to be a reconsideration of the culture's essentials. However, the deep paradox of the "nature of human life" is not worked out. What follows in the next two hundred pages are roughly functionalist expositions about funeral rites that are supposedly mainly meant to reorganize the border between life and death, to nourish the solidarity of the group, and to transfer the social role from the dead onto a living substitute, etc. The same functionalist determination is thereby applied to the funeral rites of a primitive culture in the South Seas as well as to the U.S. funeral industry. Context-related explanations are lacking just as much as an investigation of death as a significant characteristic of existence. The book is not a single case, but a typical one. A memento mori described in the introduction remains (as a premodern element) unrelated to the functionalist ideology of civilization. The text refuses to make the uncontemporaneous present. (Maybe one could argue that the mere mention of the memento mori is to be seen as a step towards a putting together, since Mandelbaum's "classic paper" of the fifties does not even make such mention: Mandelbaum straightaway argues as a Malinowskian functionalist. But the mention in Huntington and Metcalf remains weak and plays no further role in the whole book. Is it correct to call such simple schizophrenia a progress in knowledge?) The Eighties In contrast, the anthropology of the eighties treats the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous as a basic experience:</page><page sequence="16">322 first of all, as a consciousness of passing through a crisis of method and of the representation of anthropological material in terms of a philosophy of history. Geertz challenges the concept of civilization as the leading idea in anthropology as follows: "The golden age (or perhaps it was only the brass) of the social sciences when ... the basic goal of enterprise was universally agreed upon?to find out the dynamics of collective life and alter them in desired directions has clearly passed."55 Marcus and Fischer challenge positivism in the mainstream of anthropology: "In the social sciences, the goal of organizing disciplines by abstract, generalizing frameworks that encompass and guide all efforts at empirical research is being fundamentally challenged."56 But they also make clear where these challenges have almost led: into "a crisis of representation in the human sciences."57 In an important study, Johannes Fabian has outlined this crisis as the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous and has criticized, in a passage on the history of anthropological theory, the common separation of the "own" time and the "other's" time (or, in evolutionist theories, the concept of only one?"civilized"?time). Instead, Fabian calls for an anthropology as the representation of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous in its polysemous and threatening tension?for "coevalness as the problematic simultaneity of different, conflicting, contradictory forms of consciousness."58 Inductive Method: Anthropology of Mortal Man But where can the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous be grasped in its whole threatening but alluring complexity? My thesis is that in an inductive concept of the mortal and historical existence, the uncontemporaneous determinations?mimetical and hermeneutical, primitive and modern, archaic and historical become integrated, that is, they become simultaneous. In his "Thick Description,"59 Geertz already proposed an inductive method of interpretive anthropology: "Whatever, or wherever, symbol systems 'in their own terms' may be, we gain empirical access to them by inspecting events, not by arranging</page><page sequence="17">323 abstract entities into unified patterns. A further implication is that coherence cannot be the major test of validity for a cultural description."60 Indeed, this inductive outline could be useful to demonstrate "coevalness as problematic simultaneity."61 However, Geertz's outline remains within the analysis of "coherence," for he does not simply focus existence as simultaneity but concentrates again on the development of the strongly presupposive, abstract and civilized concept of the "cultural system." Geertz continues the cited passage as follows: "Cultural systems must have a minimal degree of coherence, else we would not call them systems; and, by observation, they normally have a great deal more."62 However, this "great deal more" comes only from the perspective of system analysis. On the other hand, they have "a great deal less" if anthropology is meant to demonstrate the tensions in the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous; and this might help explain Geertz's more recent shift from his "Thick Description" to a more poststructuralist approach in "Blurred Genres." In order to take up Geertz's inductive method without sharing its subjugation to systematic harmonization, one can focus on the inductive description of the uncontemporaneous in the simultaneousness of the historical existence threatened by death. This attempt is best explained by leaving cultural anthropology for a moment, since "a central concern with death has been recurrent in Western philosophy; it has certainly not been so in Western social science. . . . The existentialists saw that it is in the knowledge of death that man defines his existence; this insight has not been picked up by cultural analysis. . . . Suppression of death ... is a logical concomitant of the American faith in the ability to master the environment."63 The American concept of civilization is not contributive to an anthropology of mortality. In contrast to this, it is more useful to mention how the relation of man to myth and civilization is discussed in the philosophy of religion. The pretension of culture is for transcendence (of natural determination), as Klaus Heinrich says fittingly, and the question for "anthropomorphism" in cultural anthropology faces the difficulties of the "embodiment," rich in tension, of this "pretension of cultures for the absolute" in the existence of corporal, mortal man.64 Two</page><page sequence="18">324 basic types of this embodiment can be isolated?anthropomorphism in myths and its civilized, philosophical critique. Although they are not quite congruent, it seems possible, in my opinion, to recognize the concepts of contemporary social anthropology mentioned above in the concepts of the philosophy of religion. Then literary hermeneutics is seen as pagan myth, and mimesis as philosophical critique of this anthropomorphism. On their relation in European cultural history, Heinrich reports as follows: a primary polytheism (of Greece) gives human shape to the pretension to the absolute: the Gods are affected "by their refractory structure of needs ... the sensuous and instinctive disintegration and the ... close relatedness to action,"65 all characteristics of man. However, these gods are immortal and that's what makes them different from man. The pathein, "to suffer and to endure"66 the "pure thought, volition and feeling,"67 that is told by myths, is the magnificence of the gods, who enjoy eternal youth. To mortal man this may be much harder to experience at times, because it often means to them (despite "ritual purification") the threat of disintegration and death. A philosophy of origins related to these gods does not only recognize man in his instinctive nature (which is his power), but also nails him down in it. Thereby, it develops man's fatalism no less than his self confidence and often turns him into the hands o death even more irrevocably. In this I recognize again the ambiguities of romantic anthropology (hermeneutics). After a long period of development in Greek thought, the philosophical "critique of anthropomorphism" is erected against this threatening archaic religiosity. But its counterproject is insufficient from the start: it works out a concept of culture in which the "purification" of man from his instincts is effected in order to establish an abstract and isolated idea of self-preservation. In Plato's Phaidon, this leads to an extreme where man's corporality is made totally invalid against an ethic of the good order of the community of men, in which the pretension of culture for transcendence is realized in a new way.68 Here, the death of man is no longer an embodiment of an ineluctable fate (as in myth), but instead it has become almost meaningless, because the body does not mean anything at all anymore. One must see in this a rationalization of the menace of</page><page sequence="19">325 death. But this is a menace essential to man, and he will become its victim even more unavoidably if it is denied in this way. In Phaidon, Plato rejected the anthropological knowledge of the polytheistic myth. Nonetheless, with his view of things, he created the archetype of Western civilization. A clear line leads from Phaidon to the denial of death in the mainstream of American social anthropology: the course of evolution of Western civilization. "Our Anglo American philosophical tradition has tended to assume that the ethical text should, in the process of inquiry, converse with the intellect alone; it should not make its appeal to the emotions, feelings, and sensory responses. Plato explicitly argues that ethical learning must proceed by separating the intellect from our other merely human parts; many other writers proceed on this assumption, with or without sharing Plato's intellectualistic ethical conception."69 James Carse has fittingly associated the modern American denial of death with the corresponding attitude of the post-Platonic Greek philosopher Epicurus.70 The rise of the state form everywhere parallels the push back of the time disposition of human existence from the processes of political decision.71 The, in itself, substantial concept of mimesis is, as demonstrated, always in danger of contributing to that tendency.72 Heinrich indicates that philosophical anthropology in modern times can be constantly conceived as a "metacritique" of this kind of "critique of anthropomorphism." Eo ipso, philosophical anthropology in modern times is a critique of civilization. The outlines of Kant and Hegel remain insufficient.73 With and against the anthropology of modern times, Heinrich asks: "Now, where is that shape of a metacritique of the critique of anthropomorphism?"74 Heinrich drafts the suggestion of a solution which I pick up in my concept and summarize as follows: The historical excursion shows that the threat of death is inherent in every concept of the relation between anthropos and the idea of culture (embodiment and transcendence); death and its menace are inescapable and omnipresent. Therefore, the question of philosophical anthropology cannot be asked as follows: myth or civilization; mortal man or immortal culture, fatalism or generic history; instead it must attempt to combine these two aspects, which are inseparable from each</page><page sequence="20">326 other. But wherein can the persisting simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous be embodied? In the singularity of the individual existence, Heinrich says. Existence is to be strictly understood as simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous. And in the reverse, this is to be conceived as the threat of death, to which the individual is exposed ambiguously: "By truth man can accomplish something only if he exposes himself to this disintegration as a possibility."75 Heinrich 's suggestion is an inductive integration: to integrate in the singularity of an existence the general fact (fittingly represented in myth) that everyone must die, as well as the historical culture in which one is living. By means of this inductive integration existence is both capable of deep experience and creative renewal, but at the same time exposed to the threat of disintegration. "The inductive method . . . mediates ... in the individual the particular with the general and this inductive conclusion cannot be 'forcible' like the deductive (of myth, of metaphysics, M. B.), because in it the powers of the general and the particular are concentrated in every individual anew and in every individual in a new way."76 Only this inductive attempt at the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous really adds momentum to the "metacritique of the critique of anthropomorphism," thus shaping the platform of philosophical anthropology. In my opinion this, too, is essential to the platform of the social anthropology of death and, thereby, also to American anthropology. In contrast to Geertz's still too systematic outline, this concentration upon the mortal and historical individual provides awareness of the "problematic . . . coevalness" of the uncontemporaneous, without falling into fatalism, as often happens. On the question of mortal existence, the inductive concept keeps in view the whole equivocality, changeability (transitoriness) of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous.</page><page sequence="21">327 History of Cultural Anthropology: Concepts of "Death," "Trickster," "Socrates" The cultural anthropology of Latin American cults of the dead presents the empirical material whose interpretation enables such an anthropology to work out concrete analyses and insights. Accordingly, a critical history of North American anthropological theory on Latin American cults of the dead would have to demonstrate how through pictures of death anthropology drafts historical change. A critical examination of these pictures illuminates the anthropological conception of itself within a particular civilization, because anthropologists?deliberately or not?write as members of it. In respect of a history of the cultural anthropology of death, an early paper by Fabian, in which the metacritique of the mainstream's concepts of death is elaborated historically, can be useful.77 Moreover, such critical history would pursue the systematic purpose of demonstrating historically and empirically the plausibility of the concept outlined above: that the telos of American anthropology can be grasped in the anthropology of Latin American cults of the dead; that within these cults the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous is anthropologically "embodied"; and, moreover, that the formative power of these cults to "America" can be exhausted only by means of an inductive interpretation. This systematic discussion has a critical-rejective and a "critical redemptive" angle.78 The rejective angle shows the insufficiencies, for example, of the mainstream. Here, Fabian's work is helpful. The redemptive angle wants to emphasize those insights gained in the history of anthropology that elaborate the concept of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous. The explication of the following three concepts as important social scientific "achievements" of (American) anthropology should be kept in view: "Death" as a significant subject (in the sense of Heinrich); the "trickster," the Indian shaman, portrayed by Stanley Diamond as "the personification of human ambiguity" ( of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous).79 Of particular importance are the "tricky" means used by the trickster to cope with the threat of death</page><page sequence="22">328 inherent in this personification (embodiment); finally, the concept of Socrates as outlined in Plato's Apology: as a "wise man" menaced by death, because as a wise man he is the embodiment of truth. The "sophistic irony" of Socrates in the Apology is a creation of paralleling the practical means of the trickster. Death The individual's death is significant. The inductive method demonstrates the disintegration of the individual as the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous, of ritual and world system. When Octavio Paz laments that Mexican cults have lost their fertility providing power, then this should not be understood as ritual's decline (as Paz understands it), but as mimesis: it is the undiminished claim of the individual for embodiment in the whole contradictive historical culture that actualizes and realizes his most general, mythic fate?his mortality. In this way, the individual's death is to be seen as the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous and can be used as a key to the anthropological intepretation of society. Already in an early paper, Geertz recognized that funeral rites, if they develop "dysfunctionally"80 (measured against the criteria of functionalist anthroplogy), express social contradictions. But since he tries to "fit" these "historical materials" into a "more dynamic functionalist approach,"81 that he adopts from Talcott Parsons, Geertz misses that death as disintegration can be the key to deep anthropological cognition of the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous (and thereby to the logos of "America"). But if death is understood this way, it can be a guide to a critique of society in the name of man (the purpose of Enlightenment) as well as a guide to practical responsibility beyond pragmatist rationalization and historical opportunism. This is why "pathein" the explanation of death as a political and mythic religious element of meaning, remains indispensable in modern civilization.</page><page sequence="23">329 Trickster The trickster is known as a mythic shaman figure in Indian religions. In the tales transmitted by Paul Radin and other anthropologists of the Boasian period,82 the trickster appears to be a figure that is able to create and maintain an ambiguous attitude towards death. By that means he can assimilate death's significance practically. The trickster is laughing about this ambiguous (annihilating and instructive) death, "and this laughing . . . means accepting the ambivalence of the human condition."83 The trickster masters the ambiguity by means of "grotesque inversions"84 that "make a fool of death,"85 or outdo its ambiguity through irony and by a syncretistic instrumentarium composed of ritual, a sense of humor, social criticism and the ingenuity of alert practical wisdom. Paul Radin reports on the trickster myths of the North American Winnebago tribes accordingly. The trickster, as he is presented there, is a modern and primitive double figure. He specifically mocks the two basic rituals of Winnebago culture, through ridicule and satire. As Radin writes: "To be a successful warrior was the highest ideal of a Winnebago, and it was in the warbundle rites that this ideal received its greatest glorification. It has, therefore, a very deep significance, psychologically and culturally, that the Winnebago Trickster myth should begin with what is essentially a satire on the warbundle ritual."86 The basic doctrines and rites of society are subjected to an abstract negation, the "mocking" by "satire." But another thing is the trickster's ability to "embody" the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous without being disintegrated by it. He encounters it by "making a fool out of death," particularly by invalidating the logical principle of identity. As Radin reports, in certain tribes the trickster is imagined as a double figure with the rabbit. Through splits of identity like this, he can couple his critical and innovative function with his fear of the spirits, with his threat by death, even with his dying under the spell of old spirits he once rebelled against.87 Split identity and ritualized struggle rich in repetitions and inversions between renewal of the world and death?this is the trickster's anthropological conception.</page><page sequence="24">330 The trickster's instrumentarium is uncontemporaneous: it includes mimesis (of the origins) as well as subjectivism (of abstract negation). The most appropriate skill of the trickster figure is to master this simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous practically, or to be tricky. It is through an announcement of this skill that the trickster differs also from the primary power of immortal anthropomorphical gods, as described by Heinrich. The trickster's abilities extend beyond primary religious anthropomorphism and in this respect he takes the view of the "metacritique of the critique of anthropomorphism," that Heinrich called for. That is why he is particularly a Latin American figure. Socrates Plato's Apology88 shows a Socrates who, authenticated by an oracle from Delphi, is searching for "human wisdom," for the embodiment of truth, in his existence. And he finds out that he, Socrates himself, as a human being, in no way takes part in the truth. Absolute devotion to traditional custom or law is coupled with the abstract negation of all traditions in the name of the self of man. Mimesis and hermeneutics, the uncontemporaneous, paradoxically becomes simultaneous. This is the deep paradox in the existence of the Apology's Socrates, a paradox that can be resolved "positively" and "systematically" in anthropology only if either Socrates is banned from the polis or the laws are destroyed. But Socrates wishes to avoid this disintegration: he attempts to let the uncontemporaneous become simultaneous through embodiment in his existence. Therefore, he remains in the polis and does not revoke his free-minded insights. Thereby, and not before, he exposes himself to the threat of death (the death penalty). The threat of death is his own choice, because only in that way can he embody the uncontemporaneous. Accordingly, he does not try to "surmount" this threat in a more transcendental logic. Instead, he tries to pass through this menace?by means of his sophistic irony and arts of rhetoric. He uses tricky means in the Apology to distract the accusations of the positivistic Athenians. Just a moment ago he was characterized by modern hubris (What do "I" mean in truth?), then</page><page sequence="25">331 as devotive adept of the old customs. Now his particular skill comes into play: he is a sophistic trickster, because this is the only way to embody the simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous and to avoid the threat of death to which, for the same reason, he also exposes himself again and again. Socrates is mocking death as the trickster does. The Socrates of Apology stands on the threshold between myth and philosophy, primitive culture and civilization. Herein lies his essentiality for American anthropology. He is living through and struggling against the menace of death, that at once creates and hits him both as a free individual and as a citizen of the polis. That his means to accomplish this simultaneousness of the uncontemporaneous is the irony of the sophist (and trickster), has been shown by Kierkegaard, who interprets Socrates as a heroic critic of civilization known from existentialist philosophy. Some romantic-ironical traits in the mimetic Socrates, that thereby came to light, are unmistakeable. (Diamond sees in the trickster a Kierkegaardian existentialist?a similar concept). To introduce Socrates into the discussion of American anthropology is instructive in the attempt to show the trickster as a figure between time, not simply as a primitive counterpart to civilization, as Radin does. The analogic between the philosophical method of Socrates (irony, aporia) and the practical skills of the trickster in Indian mythology are substantial. At the same time, the difference between philosophy and the irrational persists and is informative: it shows various cultural possibilities worked out in the same anthropological tradition. The trickster can be seen as the Indian, primitive stream in the body of "American anthropology," whose European and civilized stream is the figure of Socrates. Types such as the trickster and Socrates come from different discourses?myth and philosophy?but their close connection demonstrates that these discourses are mutually permeable, that they are various possibilities within a continuity: the anthropological concept of death and mortal man as a significant category. In this concept, as well as in American anthropology, the exclusive border between the uncontemporaneous, primitive and civilized, has to be made permeable. Trickster and Socrates provide central concepts to</page><page sequence="26">332 this approach. Fittingly, in an American study of classical antiquity, Eric R. Dodds' The Greeks and the Irrational*9 Socrates was first considered as trickster-shaman. Notes 1.
