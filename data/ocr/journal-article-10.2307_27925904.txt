<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS Qedesh (Upper Galilee), Roman Temple, 1983* The second season of excavations in the Roman temple at Qedesh took place in July 1983 under the direction of the authors, on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology and'the Department of Classical Studies of Tel Aviv University, and with the assistance of M. Aviam and A. Amitay from the Mt. Meiron Field School of the Society for the Protection of Nature; members of the Society participated in the excavations. The measure ments were made by G. Solar, who also prepared the plans. The excavations were carried out in three areas and shed new light on the architectural complex. In the area of the cella, the apse has been completely uncovered. It was attached to the western wall of the cella and was built at a later stage than the temple. Arched building stones were discovered within the apse, which must have fallen when it collapsed, probably during the great earthquake of 363 C.E. In the portico area and the courtyard of the temple, east of the fa?ade of the cella, the northern part of the stylobate was uncovered, as well as the continuation of the paving of the courtyard. The laying of the slabs indicates that they formed a dromos which connected the eastern gate of the per?bolos with the portico of the temple, and was possibly used as a processional way. On the paving of the courtyard of the temple various architectural elements were uncovered: several fragments of decorated cornices, column drums, a third monolithic column (in addition to the two discovered in the first season), a well-executed Corinthian capital of the second century with three-dimensional acanthus leaves, column bases, etc. It seems that the ascent to the threshold of the central entrance of the cella was by means of a wooden staircase or ramp leaning on the threshold itself and attached by nails or other means, as indicated by the square holes in the upper part of the front of the threshold. In the eastern wall of the per?bolos, the main gateway of the t?menos was partly uncovered. Three building stages were noted, from the second and third centuries C.E. The gateway was built on the same axis as the central entrance of the cella. Near it were uncovered, among other finds, two Corinthian pilaster capitals; the elaboration of the acanthus leaves and their style enable their attribution to the third century C.E.

Kefar Hananya, Survey The ancient village of Kefar Hananya in Lower Galilee was known as an important Jewish settlement and residence of sages during Roman Byzantine times. It was inhabited by Jewish farmers during the Middle Ages until the end of the sixteenth century. Remains of an ancient synagogue quarried in the rock, architectural elements, columns, a pool, caves and rock-cut tombs are visible in the area. A team headed by Z. Ilan conducted a survey of the ruins situated on a hill at map ref. 1897 2587, concentrating on the remains of the synagogue. The building was measured and its plan drawn for the first time by Y. Tepper (Fig. 1). Its orientation proved to be east-west, and not north-south as previously Fig. 1. H. Kefar Hananya, the quarried synagogue. 1 - eastern quarried wall; 2 - western built wall; 3 - base for benches; 4 - quarried column-base; 5 - entrance; 6 - narthex; 7 - quarried room; 8 - atrium; 9 - quarried steps; 10 - water tank; 11 - quarried recess; 12-fourth base (?). suggested. Along the walls were found bases for benches (height 5-8 cm., width 45 cm.). Cut into the centre of the floor was a rectangular recess which may have served to contain support for a wooden bema. In the area of the synagogue were found an ornamented capital, which was transferred to nearby Kibbutz Parod, fragments of roof tiles and a large amount of coloured mosaic tesserae, possibly originating from the floor of a neighbouring building. Remains of another public building were found in the western section of the ancient settlement. It is built of large hewn stones, plastered on the outside; it measures 11.5 X 13.4 m. and is oriented north-south. A column was found south of this building, apparently in situ. This may have been a second synagogue, and a plastered pool found nearby (4.8 X 6.2 m.) a miqweh. A number of quarried oil-presses was found on the western slope of the hill, and below it a large pool supplying drinking water to the village. An aqueduct brought the water from Nahal Salmon, 1.5 km. upstream. Rock-cut steps connected this area with the centre of the settlement. A tomb was uncovered on the south-western side of the hill when the new road to 'Ammi'ad was built; it contained a small sarcophagus (50 X 70 cm.). (Communicated by Zvillan) Golan, Chalcolithic Sites, 1983* In July-August 1983 further excavations were held. The team of 20 Druze workers was directed by Claire Epstein, on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums, assisted by Elaine Nissen, University of Minnesota; I. Vatkin, Department of Antiquities and Museums, was surveyor and Bruce Commandeur assisted with photography. The work was supported by the National Council for Research and Development. Site near South Daliyyot Waterfall (map ref. 2223-2225 2560-2561). The purpose of the excavations here was to obtain additional information regarding the nature and layout of * Cf. IEJ 32 (1982), pp. 252-254.</page><page sequence="3">256 NOTES AND NEWS the site and to ascertain whether its overall plan, as elsewhere, was made up of a series of more or less parallel chains of houses. Ten houses were investigated in different parts of the site, both south and north of the Daliyyot stream. Most were only partially excavated, but in two the whole of the internal space was cleared. In some cases a probe made across the width of a building was sufficient to establish the position of its lateral walls and the presence of diagnostic material. In all the buildings examined a characteristic assemblage was found which included pottery and basalt vessels, flint implements and two basalt pillar figures. The settlement nucleus is situated on the south bank of the Daliyyot; it comprises at least four parallel chains of houses, with a further row on the stream's north barik in which there are both isolated buildings and some built end-to-end. Probes were also made in two houses some 150 m. away on the slope above the stream to the north. Although partly covered by two medium sized tumuli, they are almost certainly built end to-end. Nearby can be seen on the surface the walls of other houses which may point to the existence of additional ? probably parallel ? house-chains. This group probably forms part of a second adjacent settlement, situated on the upper ridge above the stream, even closer to the South Daliyyot Waterfall, where there are a wide scatter of surface material and several wall sections and additional houses. The south bank of the Daliyyot stream, where the main part of the settlement is sited, is covered with tumuli, stone heaps of all shapes and sizes and modern field walls, many of them superimposed. A line of large stones frequently runs between two stone heaps. The excavations showed that these phenomena postdate the Chalcolithic settlement. Stone heaps were found to overlie and partly cover houses; these had to be dismantled in order to reveal the earlier walls. In several houses the floor was only a few centimetres below the present-day surface and the bedrock on which the houses were erected was quickly uncovered. Owing to the poor state of preservation of many of the walls, in which only one or two courses were extant, the expected doorway in the southern long wall was found in only one building. As regards internal architectural arrangements, in several houses a small room built across the western end opened onto the main area (PI. 30:A); in one house on the north bank of the stream a square platform of unknown function was built against the northern wall. A much-used path prepared by the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel passes through the site on both banks of the stream. The excavated Chalcolithic houses provide added interest to visitors, and explanatory signs will shortly be placed at suitable points. Rasm el-Kabash (map ref. 2256 2533). During the second part of the season additional probes were made at this site, where previous work on both sides of the stream had established that the settlement nucleus, comprising some five more or less parallel chains of houses built end-to-end, was situated near a number of springs on the east bank. In addition, isolated houses had been identified and several probed at various points as far as 600 m. to the north. The aim of the work was to obtain further information regarding the overall settlement pattern and in particular the relationship between the main village and the isolated buildings scattered over a large area, especially to the west of the stream. The first house investigated, in 1978, lay far to the north of the main village on the west bank of the stream. This year probes were made in a second building nearby to the north-east; its eastern end lies on the fringe of the winter flood plain of the Kabash stream. South of these two houses, limited probes were made in two other buildings (not part of a chain) likewise situated at some distance to the north-west of the main settlement. In all the above, sections of a transverse cross wall and two lateral walls were uncovered, though it was not always possible to determine which part of each building had been revealed. Some of the wall foundations were so close to the surface that little remained of the floor and consequently there were few finds; all were characteristic of the period. In addition to the above probes trial excavations were made in a building situated to the north-east, while further limited work was carried out in houses in the main settlement. In all these, the assemblage was characteristic of other contemporary sites and included storage-jars and other pottery vessels</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND NEWS 257 and basalt and flint artifacts (among them perforated circular flint tools). Apart from the scores of dolmens which are scattered over a wide area in and around the Rasm el-Kabash site, many wall remains dating from different periods are visible on the surface; the site is also traversed by a Roman road and has Byzantine remains (some of which were identified during the present probe). Above all, there is a welter of modern field walls built directly over the Chalcolithic buildings, thereby obscuring their outlines; furthermore, the poor state of preservation frequently makes it difficult to ascertain the exact plan of a building. By and large, the architectural details inside the houses resemble those found previously, both here and at other sites. They include a small room (about 2.6 m. wide) built across the whole width of the western end of a house excavated in 1982; the discovery that the room was an integral part of this building, rather than part of an adjacent one, makes this an unusually long house (18.5 m.), especially as the remainder of its internal space is not divided by partition walls. The 1983 excavations at both sites have contributed towards a clearer understanding of their overall layout: in both the settlement is situated on two sides of a perennial stream and most of the houses ? consisting of parallel chains of buildings ? concentrate on one bank, while scattered on the periphery are isolated dwellings, or small groups of one or two houses. Some ten years ago, at the beginning of the research devoted to this culture and before the discovery of a village composed of a series of chain-built houses, it was suggested that the scattered buildings should perhaps be interpreted as belonging to shepherds and herdsmen. There is no direct evidence in support of this; however, the recurrent incidence of isolated houses in the vicinity of larger villages lends added plausibility to such an explanation. (Communicated by Claire Epstein) Hurvat Rosh Zayit, 1983 H. Rosh Zayit (Kh. Ras ez-Zaitun, map ref. 171 253) is located near the road from the 'Akko Valley to the Segev settlement area. It was excavated by Z. Gal on behalf of the Department of the Land of Israel Studies, University of Haifa, and the Misgav Regional Council. The site was surveyed two years ago as part of a historical-geographical project on the Lower Galilee and was selected for excavation because of its location between the 'Akko Valley and the hill country. The excavations revealed an Iron Age fortress measuring 23 X 20 m. defended by stone walls 2 m. thick. In the centre of the fortress, a substantial building was exposed. The building measures 15 X 12 m. and has thick walls (1.3 m.) of dressed stones laid in headers and stretchers. Two rooms and a cellar of this building were excavated; the many storage jars found in the cellar contained wheat and probably wine and olive oil. Other noteworthy finds included numerous jar stoppers and 30 iron tools including a plough weighing 2.5 kg. The many Cypro-Phoenician vessels found suggest that this was a Phoenician fort. It was destroyed by fire in the middle of the ninth century B.C.E. Its location near the Arab village of Kabul suggests its identification with biblical Kabul. (Communicated by Zvi Gal) Kh. el-Vreima (TelKinrot)f 1983 The second season of excavations at Kh. el 'Ureima (map ref. 200 252) took place from 4 September to 15 October 1983. The project, sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungs gemeinschaft, was carried out on behalf of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, and was directed by V. Fritz. Area supervisors were: Jill Carington-Smith, M. Horlemann, U. H?bner, . Rabe, A. Richter and . Rosei. The staff also included the following members: R. Dale (drawing), A. Ginzburg (registration), R.

Work was continued in the five areas already opened last season.</page><page sequence="5">258 NOTES AND NEWS Area A. In this area, located on the northern summit of the mound, three strata of the Iron Age II were uncovered. In Stratum 2, a large bastion was built; it is 11 m. wide and its full length has not yet been cleared. Near the southern corner of this tower, a city-wall 3 m. wide was built against it. This wall probably enclosed an area of about 8 dunams on the summit of the mound extending to the gate of Area D. The bastion was reused during Stratum 1, though a new city-wall was built slightly to the north. From inside the city, houses were built against the bastion. The city wall of Stratum 3 runs under the bastion of Strata 2 and 1 and probably enclosed an area of about 25 dunams. Beside this defence system a massive building was discovered; its walls stand more than 2 m. high and its rooms were filled with burnt mud-brick material. These successive strata with their fortifications can be dated from the tenth to the eighth centuries B.C.E. Area is located in the south-eastern corner of the acropolis. The wall system of the acropolis existed in Strata 1 and 2 only; the earlier city wall, of Strata 3 and 4, was discovered at the southern edge of the mound and is 6 m. wide. Inside the city of Stratum 4, three rooms of a large building were discovered, with walls running parallel to the city-wall. This structure extends further to the east and west, and probably served a public purpose. The rooms were filled with destruction debris, indicating a violent end in the late tenth or early ninth century B.C.E. Underneath this building some earlier remains of the tenth century were found, resting directly on bedrock. Area C. At the western edge of the mound two defence systems of Iron Age II were discovered. The earlier one was built over the remains of a house of the EB I. This city-wall, of Strata 3 and 4, was about 11 m. wide, and was strengthened by a revetment still standing to a height of 4 m. The revetment clearly shows a repair in the upper part. It seems that during the construction of the wall, remains of the EB were removed, because the earliest floor-level against the wall contained only pottery from EB I and II. Fragmentary walls belonged to a house of the earliest settlement during EB I. In Stratum 2, a new city-wall 4 m. wide was erected resting directly on the earlier wall. A partially excavated house of this period was separated from the wall by a street. Stratum I was very poorly preserved because of erosion, but the remains indicate that the city-wall was still in use. Area D. The southern half of the city-gate of the latest Iron Age level was further excavated. The walls stand to a height of 1.5 m. and rest on foundations which may be the remains of an earlier gate. Within the gate passage only one floor was found, partially paved with large stone slabs, and with the door socket still in place. The gate chamber was reached by climbing two steps; stone benches were built on three sides against the walls of the chamber. From the gate, a street slopes up directly into the centre of the city. Behind the inner pier of the gate was built a kind of platform; a broken incense-burner from the vicinity may indicate a cultic use. South-west of the gate a large courtyard was cleared, full of pottery typical of the eighth century B.C.E. The entire gate area is covered with evidence of violent destruction, such as ashes and burnt mud brick material. Within the passage, several iron arrowheads were found. It seems certain that the city came to an end during the campaign of Tiglath-pileser III. Farm buildings were built over the remains of the city-gate during the Hellenistic period; two Ptolomaeic coins were found underneath these structures and point to the third century B.C.E. as a terminus post quern. Area E is a continuation of the section running from Area C through Area D down the slope of the mound. Three Iron Age II levels can be distinguished. Because of the slope, the houses were built on artificial terraces, made of a mixture of soil with ashes and smaller stones. This material contained sherds from the EB I and II, MB IIB and LB, indicating that levels of these periods were removed during the construction of the houses. In the uppermost level, parts of a three-room house were cleared. No pottery from sealed loci was recovered, so the dating to the tenth and ninth centuries B.C.E. is still tentative. On top of the Iron Age II levels a later building was erected. It extends over 22 m. on its short side, while the full extent of its long side has not yet been cleared. From the corner excavated it may be assumed that this structure belongs to the</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND NEWS 259 category of the Assyrian open court building. Though no floor level was found, this structure must clearly be dated to the period after the Assyrian conquest. (Communicated by Volkmar Fritz) Yiftah'el, 1982 Yiftah'el is a PPNB site located in Nahal Yiftah'el, north-east of H. Yiftah'el in Lower Galilee (map ref. 1719 2401). The site, approximately 400 X 100 m. in area, extends along the wadi in a north-east ? south-west direction, and was discovered by A. Berman. It was initially examined as a surface site in February 1982 by A. Ronen of Haifa University and M. Lamdan and M. Davies of the Museum of Prehistory in Haifa. A salvage excavation was carried out in September-October 1982 by M. Lamdan and M. Davies with the help of O. Kurtzbard, O. Shurkin, Z. Ayalon and volun teers, and the Department of Public Works. A large plaster floor with installations was discovered, in some parts showing evidence of two phases of repairs. On some areas of the floor were piles of pulses, cereals and animal bones. Above the floor was a layer of crumbly brick material with imprints of straw and branches, and above it a thick layer of grey clayey soil extending up to the surface. The artefacts included sickle-blades, arrowheads, axes, burins and 'naviform' cores, basalt grinding stones, sea shells, votive jade axes, greenstone beads, a broken female figurine and a piece of a 'white ware' bowl. On the final day of excavation we uncovered a flexed human (female?) skeleton lacking a skull with flint chips between the fingers of her right hand. The skeleton was buried under a fallen roof made of branches, a layer of brick material and straw and a thin layer of plaster. Piles of lentils, probably set out for drying, lay above the roof layers. The position in which the skeleton was found enabled us to reconstruct the cir cumstances of the woman's death. She was kneeling on the floor collecting flint chips when the roof fell in, killing her at once. The skull was probably taken, plastered and buried under one of the plastered floors in the Neolithic village. (Communicated by Modi Lamdan) Tel Dor, 1983* The fourth season of excavations at Tel Dor was conducted in July and August 1983. The excavations were conducted by E. Stern on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and the Israel Exploration Society, in cooperation with H.P. Goldfried of the State University of California, Sacramento, H.N. Richardson of Boston University and Renate Rosenthal-Heginbottom of the University of G?ttingen. Also on the staff were I. Sharon and S. Yankelevich (field supervisors); J. Berg (surveyor); Bracha Guz-Zilberstein (registrar); O. Cohen, E. Frank, A. Gilboa, D. Kaufman and A. Kopczick (area supervisors and assistants); R.W. Younker (palaeontology); Z. Radovan (photographer); S. Dahan (administration); E. Dalai (draftsman). Students of the Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University, for whom it was the study excavation, also took part, as did about two hundred volunteers from various countries. The expedition received much assistance from Kibbutz Nahsholim, in particular from K. Raveh, and also from the staff of the Pardess-Hannah Agricultural School and mem bers of the regional council of Hof ha-Carmel. This year we continued to deepen the three areas opened in the eastern part of the mound in previous seasons in order to uncover large sections of the Persian period and Iron Age strata and to learn more about the plan of the residential quarter and fortifications of the Persian Hellenistic town. In Area C, the residential quarter which is the northernmost of the three areas, work continued on both sides of the portion excavated last year. On the western side we dug through the Hellenistic levels to reach those of the Persian period. It became clear that most of the Hellenistic walls had been robbed and only the floors were preserved; however, in the Persian phase the walls were found standing to a considerable height. Here we were able to confirm that the orthogonal plan of the residential quarter, comprised of long, narrow structures, had its beginnings in this period. During 1983 we dug below the street separating the two insulae and Cf. above, pp. 117-119.</page><page sequence="7">260 NOTES AND NEWS below the western insula. It seems that during the Persian period, in contrast to the Hellenistic level, the inner space of the houses was divided into long, narrow rooms. External and internal walls were built in the Phoenician style, with pillars of masonry and a fill of field stones in between, utilizing the local kurkar (hard sandstone). At the eastern end of Area C, we extended the excavations into the region outside the Hellenistic city-wall. It was soon realized that the entire area is occupied by a brick construction at least 8 m. wide. We believe that this is the Iron Age city wall; its exact dimensions will be determined next season. Inside the Hellenistic city-wall we reached the Persian period levels in a narrow trench, and a similar picture to that of the western side emerged; the planning of the streets and houses was identical in both periods. In Area A, the southern continuation of the residential quarter, we also reached levels of the Persian period. Several superimposed floors were uncovered, as were some of the partition walls which divided the inner space of the house in the same manner as in Area C. In both areas many finds of the Hellenistic and Persian periods were found, including coins of both periods which will help us to determine the exact dates of the various phases. Of the other finds we will mention here a large painted kr?ter and a large clay lamp consisting of a round bowl with straight walls from which project three large nozzles, both Hellenistic, and two bronze censers of the Persian period. Also discovered were clay and faience figurines and many clay lamps and pottery vessels of both periods. In the southern part of Area B, the gates area, we excavated below the levels of the Hellenistic period which were reached last year. Here we uncovered two superimposed city-gates (Fig. 1). The uppermost one is a two-chambered gate to which leads a stone-paved square from east to west. Of the gate, which was partially covered by the Hellenistic city-wall, we have uncovered the carefully laid stone paving of the entrance and both chambers, above which was a layer of hard kurkar. One socket of the outer door, made of smoothed basalt, was found intact; in the centre of the entrance was found a socket for a bolt which closed the door vertically (PI. 30:B). The second door socket is still under the Hellenistic city-wall and we hope to discover it next season. Another stone-paved square was cleared which led from the inner entrance of the gate into the town. During the later phases of the Persian period, additional buildings were erected on the square; in the final Persian phase the entire gate went out of use, leaving only a narrow passage from which a narrow street led into the town. Below the two-chambered gate were dis covered the remains of a four-chambered gate with a tower flanking each side of its fa?ade. The gate was only partially excavated but its plan, which closely resembles that of the four chambered gate of Megiddo, is clear. There is, however, a striking difference between the two; the construction of the gate at Dor is much more massive. The width of one of the inner piers, which was entirely uncovered, was 2.5 m.; it was built of two huge limestone boulders probably brought from the Carmel range. The western side of the pier, facing the city, was covered by well-dressed orthostats. The chambers were filled with brick material and their openings onto the gate passage were closed by a wide wall, evidently to strengthen the construction. It seems that the entire stone base of the gate was built at one time to carry the heavy superstructure of bricks. The gate is preserved to a height of about 2 m. This is apparently the first known example of the monumental Phoenician architecture of the Iron Age; other such structures have not yet come to light in Phoenician centres in the eastern Mediterranean. We may assume that the four-chambered gate was in use during the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.E. and was destroyed by the Assyrians at the end of the eighth century. In the two-chambered gate was found only material of the Persian period and there can be no doubt that it was in use at the beginning of that period. It is, however, logical to assume that its construction and first use took place in the Assyrian period, and that only material of its last phase is represented. Below the four-chambered gate was found a layer dating from the tenth century B.C.E., which we reached only in small sections. At the western end of Area we opened a number of new squares along the main Hellenistic and Roman street leading into the town. Here</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND NEWS 261 L.RlTMEygR, J.BERG Fig. 1. Tel Dor, isometric view and section of the gate area. more parts of the beautifully constructed Roman stone drain were cleared, as well as the extension of the street. We found here an Assyrian stamp seal out of context and a small hoard of Roman coins in a jug. In the northern part of Area we have worked through four phases of the Iron Age, the earliest of which probably dates from the tenth century B.C.E. This area, located close to and north of the city-gate, was at that time a residential quarter. In the lower phases, where the building remains are better preserved, one may discern a coherent plan; a line of rooms was probably attached to the city-wall, and was flanked on the west by a narrow street on the other side of which were additional houses. In this area were recovered many pottery vessels and sherds, some local and others imported, and a unique find in the shape of an oval Iron Age stamp seal made of an animal's horn and depicting two stags standing on mountain-tops (PL 30:C). (Communicated by Ephraim Stern)</page><page sequence="9">262 NOTES AND NEWS Caesarea, Ancient Harbour Excavation Project, 1983* The fifth season of the project took place between 15 May and 1 July 1983. The season was sponsored by the Caesarea Foundation of Baron E. de Rothschild, the Research Council of Canada, the National Endowment for the Humanities, U.S.A., the National Geographic Society, the Center for Maritime Studies, University of Haifa, the Department of Classics, University of Victoria, Canada, the Department of History, University of Colorado at Boulder, and the Center for Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Maryland. The project is now affiliated with the American Schools of Oriental Research. The head of the project is A. Raban; co-directors are R.L. Hohlfelder, J.P. Oleson and R.L. Vann. Over 100 volunteers, mostly divers, from Canada, the U.S.A., Peru, Italy, Australia and Israel participated in the excavations. Area E2 is located some 40-50 m. east of El (excavated in 1980) on both sides of the subsidiary sea wall which runs parallel to and outside the south-western part of the main breakwater. At the inner and outer faces of the sea wall trenches reached below the foundations. The structure was laid on a base of fine rubble and pebbles about 12-15 m. wide. The seabed beneath it is 8.1 m. below the modern sea-level (MSL). Several pottery sherds dating from the second century B.C.E. and a few of the Herodian period may predate the structure or may have penetrated into the rubble. The sea wall was built with an unusual mixture of techniques: cemented blocks of artificial conglomerate were placed at intervals and between these are large rubble blocks in roughly laid courses. It seems clear that the wall was built in a single stage, probably at the same time as the main breakwater, though there is no architectural connection between the two. The subsidiary breakwater was much narrower and rather lower than the main one, probably no higher than the original sea-level. It is 30 m. from the main breakwater and can be traced for about 170 m., up to the point where the main breakwater curves towards the north. Area NI. A trench was dug along the south eastern edge of a large rectangular mass of debris covering some 30 X 50 m. just inside the main southern breakwater. The trench was 3-4 m. wide and over 10 m. long, reaching the inner face of the breakwater. The debris seems to consist of two parts. The higher part, 2-3 m. above the seabed and only 1-2 m. lower than the top of the breakwater, consists of offset ashlar blocks, probably from the paving of the main quay and perhaps from some additional collapsed structure. There is about a metre of sand between the original seabed of the Herodian period and the base of the debris, which thus clearly postdates the Herodian period. It would appear to be merely an accumulation of debris from the destroyed breakwater and its superstructures. The lower part, farther into the harbour, is 1.5 m. lower and consists mainly of small ashlars and rubble. On top of this part are at least five heaps of ballast stones, most of basalt. With these are many sherds of amphorae dated to the third-fifth centuries C.E. These are probably from ships which were wrecked on the submerged breakwater a short distance away. The trench penetrated below the inner face of the main breakwater, which lacked the ashlar courses found in the western section, between Areas A and C. Some of the original ashlars of the foundation course of the Herodian inner quay were exposed; they measure 3 X 1 X 1 m., and all were tilted 30?-40? anticlockwise. Area N2 is a trench dug towards the inner face of the main southern breakwater, about 60 m. east of Nl. Here the foundation blocks and in fact the entire inner facing of the quay are entirely lacking. The trench was widened and deepened to below the seabed of the Herodian period. As in other excavated areas in this part of the harbour, this level is just over 8 m. below MSL and is comprised of a compact layer of fine silt, probably deposited when the basin was well protected and wave action was minimal; late first century B.C.E.-early first-century C.E. sherds lay on it. Excavation revealed a sand-filled hollow where the inner face and its foundation course were believed to be located. The absence of tilted ashlars in this part of the breakwater suggests that in this area of the Herodian harbour high quality building materials were salvaged from the *Cf. above, pp. 119-121.</page><page sequence="10">NOTES AND NEWS 263 seabed at a later period to be reused on land, probably by the Crusaders. Area I is on land, some 100 m. south-east of the beach in the intermediate basin. It is just west of the complex of walls excavated by A. Negev in the early 1960s. Negev defined this complex, slightly south of the temple podium, as a Roman pier (EAEHL I, p. 274). In 1976 we opened a square pit at the south-western end of an area of white ashlar paving slabs, exposing the face of a wall buried under the paving and almost aligned with it. The top of this wall is 1.4 m. under MSL and its face was found well agglomerated with the fill of gravel, sand, silt, occasional building stones and pottery sherds. Underneath, at about MSL and submerged in ground water, an abrasive notch was detected with marine oysters still attached to the wall below it. At that time this was believed to indicate that the wall was the eastern side of the Herodian inner basin. This year a new trench was dug along the northern edge of the paving. The stratigraphie picture here resembles that of the 1976 season. Under the paving is an ashlar wall, built of alternating headers and stretchers. Each course is 0.4 m. high and the top of the wall is 1.4 m. above MSL; its orientation is about 5? clockwise from the superimposed pavement. Between 1.2 and 0.6 m. above MSL is a beachrock-like conglomeration of debris, a result of the seasonal face of the ground water in this area. Below this fill is another one comprised of water-carried material. At 0.2-0.3 m. above MSL was detected the abrasive notch, a clear indication of the fairly prolonged presence of a body of stale surface water. Just above it was exposed a mooring stone, incorporated into the second course from the top. The stone is horizontally pierced (diameter of hole about 20 cm.); it protrudes 0.6 m. from the face of the wall and the centre of the hole is about 0.5 m. above the abrasive notch. The height is appropriate for mooring freighters and small boats rather than seagoing vessels. Area Y is the area of shallow water partly protected by rocky reefs to the west and south west, about 150 m. north of the Hellenistic quay of Straton's Tower (Area J). Here we traced in 1976 a series of wooden ship frames protruding from the sandy bottom. In 1980 a few wooden planks were exposed by natural currents and the wreck could be dated to the Roman period on the basis of the building technique of its shell and the types of mortises and tenons used to fasten the planks to one another. This year, in early April, some 14 X 3 m. of the southern part of the hull were exposed by currents, and a survey yielded two bronze balance scales from near the wreck. The site of the wreck is about 60 m. offshore at the edge of an area of the seabed littered with building stones, ashlars and pottery sherds which had been dragged from the coastline by stormy waves. The seabed below the wreck's hull is about 2.5 m. below MSL and there is generally an additional layer of over 1 m. of sand. Excavation in such a locality can be carried out only when the sea is extremely calm (unusual in late May and June) and cannot be done with airlifts. In spite of adverse conditions, about 14 X 5 m. (approximately one third of the preserved part of the hull) were exposed and systematically surveyed, measured and drawn (PI. 31:B). It would seem that only about one third of the original breadth of the hull is preserved, from next to midship to above the bilge. The estimated size of this ship is 40 X 12 m. The preserved part of the hull does not contain the ceiling, the keelson or any beams, but only the planking and the entire frame system. The planking boards are over 8 cm. thick and the mortises are arranged alternately. The ship was lead-sheeted below the water line; some of this sheeting is still in place, though much was torn off by wave action and can be discerned below the sand all over the area. The frames consist of rather heavy beams, each about 16 cm. thick and 25-28 cm. high. They were closely laid only 9 cm. apart, resulting in a heavy construction. The best parallel to this hull is that of a Republican merchantman dated to the early first century CE. excavated at Madrague de Giens off southern France. The frames of the French wreck are rather more slender than those of that at Caesarea, and it seems that she was somewhat smaller; her estimated carrying capacity is about 250 tons. A survey of the sea bottom by divers with metal-detectors revealed additional lead parts and abundant pottery sherds. Although many of the sherds may have been washed from the land, there is a relatively large quantity of broken dolia ? vessels foreign to the Middle East and so far</page><page sequence="11">264 NOTES AND NEWS rarely found in excavations on land. However, these were standard containers for the Republican and later Roman seaborne trade. The heavy construction of the merchantman and the presence of dolia and balance scales suggest that the vessel carried a bulk cargo valuable enough to be weighed when loaded or unloaded, for instance salt from the Dead Sea or spices such as myrrh or black pepper. Pieces of mud-compacted dunnage found between the frames may be remnants of a stabilizing fill between the dolia in the hold. Some well-preserved pieces of rather heavy ropes were found in the wreck; these, together with samples of the planking, frames, tenons and tree nails, were sent for examination to the den droarchaeological laboratory of Tel Aviv University. Samples of mortar, cement, conglomerated materials and building stones were sent to the Petrological Laboratories of Victoria University. A large group of architects and students from the school of architecture at the University of Maryland drew and measured the rock-cut and architectural remains along the shore line of the urban area of Caesarea. Another survey was carried out along the line of the sunken Herodian breakwater by a group of divers directed by A. Sherwood of Princeton University. A dozen sections were made across the breakwater and samples of its building materials were carefully extracted. (Communicated by A vner Raban) Tel 'Amai, 1983 Salvage excavations were carried out at Tel 'Amai (Tell el-4Asi) during February-May 1983, directed by Nurit Feig on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums and with the participation of volunteers. The site (map ref. 192 212) is located on the south bank of Nahal4Amai. It was first excavated in 1962-1963 by S. Levi and G. Edelstein (IEJ 12 [1962], p. 147). The remains found were dated to the MB I, the Iron Age and the Hellenistic period. Because of the planned expansion of the museum which is situated on the mound, the area south of the previous excavation was excavated this year. Two burial caves of the MB I were discovered hewn in the natural rock. They are the shaft type typical of the period; their shafts are 2 m. deep. In the southern wall of both shafts were two or three steps. At the bases of the shafts were found the stones which sealed the entrances. From the eastern cave a passage leads to the western via a step 0.5 m. high. The second cave has what appears to be an additional chamber to the west, thought the excavation of this chamber has not yet been completed. Two additional shafts were discovered west of the two excavated tombs but were not excavated. In both tombs the burial offerings were placed behind the sealing stone in the central part of the cave. The finds include red painted jars, several variants of juglets with red decoration on white slip, a Megiddo-type 'teapot' and a dagger blade, all attributed to the MB I. The Iron Age occupation was founded on a sterile layer 60 cm. thick over the bedrock, and did not relate to the MB I burials below. Its remains were dated to the tenth-eighth centuries B.C.E. and are rural in character. The buildings were constructed of dried mud brick on a one course stone foundation. Two hearths built from half baked clay and potsherds were found. Many pottery vessels, including cooking pots, jars, juglets, bowls and chalices, were found on the floors, alongside loom weights and grinding stones. The two strata of the Iron Age village were destroyed by fire, the later one in the second half of the eighth century B.C.E. (Communicated by Nurit Feig) The 'Emeq Hefer Archaeological Research Project, 1983* The fifth season of excavation in 'Emeq Hefer was conducted by the State University of New York at Buffalo and the Brooklyn Museum, in cooperation with Rutgers University (Newark, New Jersey), the Jewish Museum (New York) and the Department of Antiquities and Museums, from 24 June to 11 August 1983.

Ungerleider Philanthropic fund, the Rutgers University Research Council, the Department of Antiquities and Museums, the Jewish Museum and private donations. Local accommodation was provided by the 'Emeq Hefer Municipality. TelHefer Area A. This season, the westernmost square in the section down the slope reached the boundary of the built-up mound, confirming an earlier hypothesis that the western edge of the original mound had been removed not only by recent terracing but also by ancient farmers who mined the site for its rich soil. The now completed stratigraphie section appears to cut directly through a structure in each occupational level. Thus western limits of the Iron Age, LB and MB HA settlements have now been located here. The northern wall and entrance of the MB IIA public building was excavated this season. The extant building consists of this entrance fronted by a fcwrfcar-paved courtyard and several inner courtyards and rooms. During excavation below this building, the stratigraphy of the earlier part of the MB IIA was further delineated. The earliest stratum consisted of a hard-packed kurkar paving placed on the levelled and smoothed original surface of the mound; sherds of the MB IIA were found on the paving. Above were poorly-preserved remains of a structure, on the floor of which were several vessels, most of them storage-jars. The pottery of these two strata is dated to the earliest MB IIA phases and is, at least in part, contemporary with the pre-palace MB IIA phase at Aphek. Between these two early phases and the well-preserved MB IIA building are some additional building remains, whose nature is not yet clear. Two squares were excavated in this area in order to investigate further the nature of the LB settlement. Several strata of the LB I and II were uncovered, indicating that the LB occupation of the site was of longer duration than previously thought. An exceptional find was a dense concentration of LB pottery (PI. 31 : A), consisting of more than 50 vessels (bowls, kraters, oil lamps, jugs, jars and one pithos fragment similar to the Hazor LB type), some piled on top of one another. Most of the vessels are local; some are painted. A few Cypriote Base Ring I juglets were among these vessels. In Area C, on the eastern side of the mound, the excavation was expanded to the north and west. As in previous seasons, the MB IIA settlement was found close to the surface, just below the Byzantine dump. Bedrock was reached in several squares in this area and the stratigraphy previously established for the eastern slope was confirmed. The earliest settlement dates from the EB I. From this settlement only a few fragments of walls and surfaces were preserved. Concentra tions of pottery mixed with stone tools were recovered, some in depressions in the kurkar bedrock. Between the EB I remains and the earliest MB IIB settlement was an accumulation of debris, the principal feature of which was a lens of dark grey soil, in which were found a few sherds of the MB I, in addition of EB I and MB IIA sherds. No building remains are associated with this accumulation, which represents the levelling of the mound for the MB IIA settlement. This accumulation is cut through by MB IIA and later buildings and their related domestic installations (tabuns, storage-bins and refuse pits). Remains of the earlier MB IIA settlement were found throughout the excavated area. They consist at present of one thick stone wall to which narrower walls were added in a later sub-phase.</page><page sequence="13">266 NOTES AND NEWS Most of the area east and south of this building was left open; the dark colour of the soil indicates its use as a dump for organic refuse. This settlement was destroyed violently, as attested by fallen walls, burnt mud brick, roofing material and charcoal found in the building and in the open area. On living surfaces in and outside the building were found many pottery vessels, such as jars, jugs, cooking pots and bowls. Sunk into one floor was a large intact kr?ter decorated with a rope pattern and incised wavy lines. In addition to the local pottery, there are a few examples of imported vessels, some of which have been tenta tively identified as Egyptian. Others?specifical ly jug types ? were decorated in painted styles reminiscent of northern Israel and Syria. The remains of the later MB IIA settlement were discovered above the destroyed buildings of the earlier. This later settlement reused the earlier walls as foundations, resulting in a similar architectural plan, at least for the recovered remains. In the new squares two phases were distinguished, the second expanding to fill the site with one-room houses and adjacent courtyards, built alongside each other. The second phase was also violently destroyed. A general remark can now be made about the nature of the settlement at the site in the MB IIA. The earlier settlement remains in Areas A and C are similar in that they are composed of scattered buildings and open areas. The later settlements were more densely built up and covered the entire excavated area. It is, however, too early to correlate Areas A and C more precisely. North-east of the mound a wine press was accidently unearthed during trenching by the utilities company preparing a new telephone line. The wine press (10.75 X 6.1 m.) was in use during the Byzantine period, as is attested by the sherds recovered in the fill. It consisted of a large pressing surface, 6 X 5.5 m., and vats for the juice, each 2.2 X 2.1 m. The vats were lined with mosaic tesserae. Tel Mikhmoret (North) The cemetery at Mikhmoret (Area N) is just north of the modern harbour. A salvage operation was carried out in two tombs broken open by the sea in recent winters. The tombs had been cut into the kurkar ridge, and both tombs had a deep rectangular shaft. Originally, each tomb had two burial chambers, one at each end of the shaft, though those closest to the sea have been destroyed. The extant chambers are rectangular in plan, with flat ceilings and straight walls, though the walls lean slightly inwards. The floors of the chambers are lower than the bottoms of the shafts. Each chamber was once sealed from the shaft by a wall made of kurkar blocks. Along the long sides of the lower part of the shaft are ledges which evidently supported stone slabs covering burials in the shaft and the chambers' entrances. The shaft was sealed with slabs at ground level. Near one corner of the shaft are notches cut in the walls as toeholds. The contents of the tombs were disturbed in antiquity; however, a Persian period amphora and a jug were found in a corner of one of the chambers, preserved under a chunk of fallen ceiling. In the other tomb, juglets and a painted East Greek jug were discovered. These finds date the tombs to the Persian period (fifth-fourth centuries B.C.E.). Tel Mikhmoret (South) The excavation in Area S on the mound, south of the modern harbour, was expanded to uncover more of the large public building found in earlier seasons. The excavated plan of this structure now extends over more than 15 X 20 m. Most of the walls were destroyed above floor-level, but their foundations, built on bedrock, are preserved for over 2 m. One floor dated to the late fifth to early fourth centuries B.C.E. was discovered below an ash level. Below this floor was found a fill comprised of the debris of the Iron Age II settlement, containing sherds of the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.E. (cooking pots, jars, jugs, and Samar?an red-burnished bowls), and a few LB sherds. An investigation of the contem poraneity of the Mikhmoret Iron Age II remains with those of Tel Hefer is planned. This year a survey project was begun in the waters along the coast, fronting the present mouth of the Alexander river, the mound and the cemetery. The preparation of a map of the underwater topography was begun so that it could be used in future seasons. Two stone anchors and a stone net-weight were recovered.

Stieglitz)</page><page sequence="14">NOTES AND NEWS 267 Shiloh, 1983* The third season of excavations at Shiloh was conducted in July and August by the Department of Land of Israel Studies of Bar Ilan University. The excavations were directed by I. Finkelstein, assisted by Sh. Bonimowitz and Z. Lederman. The staff included M. Kislev (archaeobotany), A. Demsky, S. Rosenberg (surveying), A. Gelner and M. Weinberg (photography), Pnina Ben Hananya and Ariella Cohen (registration), Amalia Katzenelson (restoration), Bernadina Luttinger (drawing), D. Gol (administration), A. Feldshtein, Michal Iron-Lubin, I. Katz and S. Yosef (area supervisors). Students of Bar Ilan University, foreign volunteers and army teachers, averaging 50-60 per week, participated. The expedition received assistance from the National Council for Research and Development, the Jewish National Fund, the Israel Defence Forces, the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the archaeological staff officer of Judea and Samaria and the settlement of Shiloh. Excavation this year continued work begun in previous seasons; no new areas were opened. The expedition's goal was to complete the exposure of Iron Age I structures in Area C and to further the understanding of Shiloh's history during the MB and LB. Area C. In this area, situated on the mound's western side, the exposure of Iron Age I pillared structures was concluded. Building 335 was completely excavated and its plan elucidated. Two flagstone-paved areas are divided by a wide courtyard, the three spaces separated by two rows of stone pillars. In the courtyard were uncovered two installations and a plastered cistern, which remained in use after the destruction of the house. On the east this structure was built against the MB city-wall, which was preserved to a height of 2.5 m., while its western wall consisted of a high retaining wall. The columns were preserved to a height of one metre or more and the northern wall stands to a height of 2 m. Here too, in the portion of the building excavated this year, indications were present of the intense conflagration which seems to have destroyed Shiloh in the mid-eleventh century .CE. On the northern pavement was discovered a heap of carbonized raisins in a remarkably good state of preservation. Both the northern and southern walls of the Iron Age I building complex rest on the continuation of the MB glacis, substantiating the assumption that a portion of the glacis was removed in order to construct the Iron Age buildings. Trial soundings were carried out in the west of Area C in order to determine whether additional structures existed downslope. A collapse of stone and bricks was penetrated to bedrock, indicating that the western wall of Hall 306 is the site's outermost wall in this direction. Area D. In this area, located in the north-eastern part of the mound, excavation of the MB fortifications continued. It was discovered that the MB city-wall forms a kind of projection in which a drainage channel was uncovered. Another massive wall was revealed, as thick as the city-wall itself, extending south-west from the city-wall towards the interior of the site. Its function is still unclear. A section through the MB glacis was completed this year down to bedrock, partly by mechanical means (PI. 31 :C). The section is 4 m. wide and 30 m. long. The length of the glacis is 25 m. and its maximum width 6.3 m. The city-wall, founded on bedrock, rises in the section to a height of about 8 m. Approximately 2 m. downslope from the city-wall was built a retaining wall, 0.9 m. wide and 3.2 m. high, to strengthen the glacis and prevent its erosion. At the foot of the slope the glacis was supported by large boulders. Four main layers can be detected in the glacis: an upper layer of brownish-red mud-like soil; a second main layer comprised of one metre of white friable material with small stones; a third multi-coloured layer which was dumped in a direction opposite to that of the slope; and a fourth layer, yellowish-grey in colour, containing a large quantity of MB IIB pottery including a zoomorphic vessel and part of a cultic stand. It would appear that this material was taken from the area of the previous unwalled settlement. Above and mostly within the city-wall, excavation of LB deposits continued this season. A large number of broken vessels was discovered in these deposits, mainly bowls, together with *Cf. above, pp. 123-126.</page><page sequence="15">268 NOTES AND NEWS lamps, juglets, chalices and Cypriote sherds, as well as an abundance of bones. A few vessels containing bones and ash were found. Most of the pottery belongs to the LB I. Iron Age I silos lined with small stones were dug into the LB deposits. Area F. Excavation of the MB city-wall, 5.5 m. thick here, was completed in this area, on the mound's north-western side. After the removal of a Roman structure, a complex of four MB rooms adjacent to the city-wall was uncovered (PL 31 :D). The walls of these rooms were preserved to a height of 2.5 m. A great deal of pottery, including tens of storage-jars, cultic stands, small votive bowls, etc., was found here. Also discovered were metal objects and a zoomorphic vessel, a white-slipped and burnished bull decorated with red-painted stripes. The MB rooms were destroyed in an intense fire. The eastern wall of these rooms, parallel to the city wall, appears to have served as a terrace wall for structures of a higher level, and thus the lower rooms may have been basements. Area J. Here, in the mound* s south-west sector, it became clear that the massive retaining wall uncovered in the previous season is Roman in date. In a section dug to the west of this wall we discerned a 2 m. thick layer of detritus dumped at an angle, which contained Iron Age I pottery. It apparently signifies the southern limit of the settlement during that period. A small section of the MB glacis was uncovered underneath this material. On a higher terrace excavation of another section of the MB city-wall continued, revealing Roman structures built over the fortification and to the north of it. Area K. On the mound's northern side, an MB wall parallel to the city-wall was found, as were some silos of the Iron Age I. Summary. The initial settlement at Shiloh was established in the MB IIB and was unfortified. At a later stage of the MB II the massive and impressive ramparts were constructed to enclose an area of 17 dunams (4.2 acres). The settlement was destroyed at the end of that period. Immediately afterwards, in the LB I, activity at the site was renewed, though apparently it served as a cultic place rather than a settlement. The votive vessels brought to the site were buried or discarded over a wide area of the north-western slope. Activity ceased before the end of the LB and the site was abandoned until Iron Age I. Evidence brought to light this year further strengthens indications that the Iron Age I settlement was not large; excavation in the northern areas of the mound revealed only silos and it also became clear that Area J is to the south of the built-up area. It is therefore apparent that occupation was concentrated between Area C on the western slope and Area E at the top of the eastern slope (excavated in 1981), and south of Area up to just north of Area J. The Iron Age I settlement was destroyed in an intense conflagration. (Communicated by I. Finkelstein, Sh. Bonimowitz and Z. Lederman) Yavne Yam, 1980 In August 1980, a three-week excavation was conducted on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums at the site of the ancient coastal town of Yavne Yam (the harbour of Jamnia, Minat Rubin), 1.5 km. south-west of Kibbutz Palmahim (map ref. 1213 1470). The excavations were directed by Fanny Vitto, assisted by Gila Cook (surveyor) and by volunteers from abroad and from Israel, including members of the kibbutz. The aim of the project was to rescue what still remained of a mosaic pavement which the sea is gradually washing away. A room buried below about 1.5 m. of sand and bounded by severely eroded walls 70 cm. wide was uncovered. The room was paved with a polychrome mosaic which once measured 6 X 4 m., but of which two-thirds had already been destroyed by the sea. Since the decoration of this floor, apart from its central panel, is geometric and its composition strictly symmetrical, we can reconstruct most of it from the preserved portion. On either side was a white strip 69 cm. wide, ornamented by two parallel rows of stylized red and black flowers. The middle field is square: a border 84 cm. wide contains intertwined triangles, rectangles and lozenges, and a band 11 cm. wide of red and white triangles surrounds</page><page sequence="16">NOTES AND NEWS 269 the central panel. In the square central panel is an octagon with each side measuring 61 cm., surrounded by eight squares alternating with triangles and lozenges, all containing various geometric patterns. In the right-hand preserved part of the octagon are motifs from the plant and animal world on a white background: in the centre of the octagon, a pomegranate tree and in front of it a running animal (a stag or a deer) of which only the hind quarters are preserved; above and to the right a bird, its wings spread out (PI. 30:D); at the extreme right a stylized red three flowered plant. Additional animals and plants certainly occupied the missing part of the octagon. The execution of the pavement displays a high level of craftsmanship. The tesserae are of limestone, of nine different colours with a wide range of nuances. The density of the tesserae is 121 to the dm.2 in the central panel and 49 to the dm.2 in the borders and flanking strips. From the style of the mosaic, as well as from the coins and pottery remains related to it, it should probably be dated to the fifth century CE., a period during which building activity seems to have taken place in the town: the Life of Peter the Iberian mentions a hostelry and a large church 'of St. Stephen, of St. Thomas and of many holy martyrs', built in Yavne Yam by the Empress Eudocia. From the orientation of the motifs in the octagon, we may assume that the entrance to the room was in the north-western wall, which has been entirely eroded by the sea. Within the debris covering the mosaic floor was found a large amount of mosaic fragments depicting geometric motifs and stylized flowers in white, red and black. This- additional mosaic may have been placed on the wall or in an upper storey. The room was part of a larger complex of which only a few additional sections could be excavated during the season. Six metres to the east of the mosaic room, a 15 m. long section of a water channel was uncovered. It consists of a 60 cm. wide wall built of field stones and mortar containing pottery sherds topped by a 20 cm. wide plastered groove. According to a limited survey carried out in the area, it seems to have run for more than 1 km. parallel to the sea, and is related to various basins and cisterns. Every few metres, pottery pipes emerge from the channel for distribution of the water. The function of the building is not known, but because of the water channel and the numerous pottery pipes found in the debris of the room, one may assume that it was an installation connected with water, perhaps a bath. According to the pottery and the coins, the building seems to have continued in use at least until the end of the sixth century CE. In the area excavated (100 m.2), no structures relating to the Arab period were uncovered; however, a few surface finds indicate that some activity continued on the site, as is also suggested by a Crusader literary source mentioning the harbour. A limited sounding below the mosaic floor, executed after it had been lifted, revealed that the pavement had been laid directly on a mud-brick wall which seems to date, according to a Rhodian jar-handle and a Hasmonean coin found nearby, from the Hellenistic period. This Hellenistic level was apparently that which, according to 2 Mace. 12:8, 40, was attacked by Judas Maccabee and set on fire together with the Seleucid fleet. (Communicated by Fanny Vitto) Tel Batash (Timnah), 1983* The sixth season of excavations at Tel Batash (Timnah) was sponsored by the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas, in collaboration with the Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, from 13 June to 13 July 1983. G.L. Keim was expedition director and A. Mazar was archaeological field director. The archaeological staff included B. Brandl, T.V. Brisco, Marilyn Copeland and M. Fleitmann (area supervisors), L. Bruce, D. Cole and W. Harris (assistant supervisors), L. Ritmeyer (architect), Joyce Harris (assistant architect), Linda Keim and Orah Mazar (restorers). Work was conducted in Areas B, C, E, F and G with the participation of 40-45 volunteers. Area B. A section was excavated below the floor levels of the Stratum VIII building exposed in the previous season. Two additional LB strata with a clear stratigraphie sequence were excavated. In *Cf. above, p. 126.</page><page sequence="17">270 NOTES AND NEWS Stratum IX a floor covered by a thick layer of burnt debris was exposed. This floor abuts a massive wall on the north, along the slope of the mound. The wall continued to serve as the outer wall of the large buildings of Strata VIII and VII, while other walls of the Stratum IX building went out of use in the following strata. A group of restorable pottery vessels found on the floor may be dated to the fifteenth century B.C.E. After the removal of the floor of Stratum IX, another- burnt layer was discovered covering a floor of Stratum X. No architecture could be assigned to this earlier phase of occupation. The pottery included restorable LB I vessels and two sherds of Bichrome ware. A well-preserved oven was found on the Stratum X floor. Penetration of the beaten earth floor of Stratum X exposed brick material and earth layers of Stratum XI containing a few MB and Pottery Neolithic sherds. This evidence suggests that the top of the MB rampart has been reached. Thus, five superimposed and clearly defined LB strata, four of which were destroyed by intense fire, have been exposed in Area B. Area C. The excavation in Area C concentrated on exposing the stratigraphie and architectural connections between elements excavated in previous seasons. Additional exposure of the outer gate of the Iron Age II revealed a large L shaped wall (PL 32:A). Near the base of the mound, this widens to at least 6 m., and though only partially excavated, it may be defined as a tower. This structure is complemented beyond an intervening passage by the foundation of another tower (5x5 m.) excavated at a higher level on the slope. This outer gate was previously related to the two square towers which were attributed to Stratum IV (tenth century B.C.E.). However, this relationship now appears less secure. The outer gate was apparently constructed when the two towers were already in ruins, though this point is still uncertain owing to extensive erosion along the slope of the mound. Thus, the dating of the outer gate remains enigmatic, though it could have been contemporary with the inner gates of Strata III and II. A partial dismantling of the northern square tower, tentatively related to Stratum IV, revealed its construction upon a massive wall, 1 m. wide, which may have been the outer city-wall in Stratum VI or V, and is probably related to the large brick structure of Stratum V exposed during the previous season. Continued excavation of this building exposed foundations below floor-level which indicated that the brick walls formed frames for extensive fill composed of bricks and brick material. However, new data concerning the plan or function of this structure were lacking. Excavation north of the Iron Age II inner gate exposed structural remains of Strata II-V which will contribute to the dating of the gate structures. Area E. Excavation in this area was concerned primarily with penetrating the floor of the Stratum II building exposed during the previous season in order to explore earlier strata and to determine the occupational sequence. It became clear that in some parts of the house tenth century Stratum IV, or even Stratum V, debris lay directly below a single packed-earth floor. In other rooms, however, remains of an earlier architectural phase of this building could be observed. These remains consisted of patches of earlier floor levels and remnants of original walls which were rebuilt in Stratum II. Thus, this 'oil press' building, like the dwelling on its east (in Area D), was founded in Stratum III and continued in use in Stratum II with only slight modifications. Remains of Stratum IV (tenth century B.C.E.) were found in only two squares. A massive stone wall below the street level in Stratum III was found to penetrate below the city-wall. In another square, part of a tenth-century B.C.E. building with a collection of restorable pottery on its floor was excavated. Tenth-century structures appear to be isolated, and clarification of this stratum has only begun. The remains of brick walls of Stratum V (Philistine culture) were found in the northern part of the area, while in its central part an accumulation of grey earth characteristic of an open area is the dominant feature. Area F. An area adjoining the Iron Age II city wall, 20 m. west of Area E, was opened. An electron resistivity survey completed during the spring of 1983 by A. Karmorvant from the University of Tours suggested the possible existence of a massive structure in this location. Excavation, however, revealed architectural features similar to those found in Areas D and E.</page><page sequence="18">NOTES AND NEWS 271 Part of the city-wall was exposed at a point where it had been disturbed by a large pit of the Persian period (Stratum I). A section of the street inside the city-wall was partially excavated. South of the street, which runs along the city-wall for at least 75 m. (from Area D to Area F), parts of two dwellings were excavated. In the eastern building, a courtyard divided by four stone pillars contained stone industrial installations. Its stone floor was covered by a thick layer of destruction debris. An extensive pottery assemblage recovered from this building included fragments of a large storage jar with three rosette stamp sealings characteristic of the final phase of the Iron Age in Judah. Part of the building on the west contained an industrial installation of the Oil press' type and a pottery assemblage in a thick layer of burnt debris. The excavation of this area has revealed a uniform city plan during Iron Age II along the northern edge of the mound. The street which ran along the northern wall was lined on its south by a row of dwellings of similar type and construction. Area G. The electron resistivity survey had also indicated the existence of a massive structure to the south-west of the gate. Perpendicular probe trenches revealed a thick accumulation of wadi pebbles and stones creating an artificial mound which covered stone walls of the final Iron Age level. This stone mound contained Persian period pottery and was bordered on the west by a stone wall found below the surface. Though the purpose of this stone accumulation remains obscure, it must have been related to activity in this area in the Persian period. Additional excavation may reveal whether it was a foundation or podium for some architectural purpose or the mere result of stone piling during the preparation of the area for agriculture. (Communicated by GX. Keim and A. Mazar) Horv?t Vza, 1983* The second excavation season at H. 'Uza in the eastern Negev was conducted in June 1983 and lasted four weeks. The excavations, co-sponsored by the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University, and Baylor University of Waco, Texas, were directed by I. Beit Arien and B. Cresson. The staff included J. Albright, P. Brody and Jodi Magnes (area supervisors), Leora Sandier (registrar), A. Hay and M. Weinberg (photographers) and Y. Kapelyan (surveyor and draughtsman). Digging was concentrated mainly on the gate area of the Iron Age fort, which was almost completely exposed. The gateway was defended by two projecting towers, each measuring approximately 1.5 X 2.5 m. (Pl. 32:B). The width of the entrance was 3.7 m. and the length of the gate passage about 6.5 m. On the left-hand side were two chambers of different lengths, the first about 1.5 m. long and the second about 3 m. long. On the opposite side of the passage the layout was different, consisting of a single chamber of the broadroom type, one of a series of rooms that was incorporated into a massive structure that extended inside the fort; so far, only the eastern end of this structure has been excavated. Most of the gate passage was paved with large river pebbles and the rest covered with a lime plaster composition; the left-hand chambers had beaten earth floors, while the right hand room had a very thick plastered floor, apparently a remnant of an earlier structure. A great quantity of carbonized wood, probably the remains of wooden beams, and other signs of an intense conflagration were found in the passage. The pottery retrieved from this area all dates from the seventh century B.C.E. During the Hellenistic period (third century B.C.E.), when the fort was restored, its size was decreased and only the entrance to the gatehouse was utilized; its width was decreased to about 1.75 m. and the floor of the gate passage raised by about 60 cm. Although the watchtowers continued to guard the entrance, the gate chambers no longer opened onto the passage and the space was apparently used for other purposes. Three structures in the courtyard of the Iron Age fort were exposed. One of them abutted onto the interior part of the gate structure and was adjoined by a square podium (about 1X1 m.) with three steps leading up to it. The function of this podium has not yet been clarified, but considering the high level of all three structures, it most likely * Cf. IEJ 32 (1982), pp. 262-263.</page><page sequence="19">272 NOTES AND NEWS belongs to the very latest phase of the Iron Age fort. In another excavation area opened during the 1983 season on the southern side of the stronghold, two casemates of the Roman fort, including two Herodian phases, were unearthed. About 1.8 m. beneath these Roman remains were several parts of casemates of the Iron Age fort, one of which had a lime-plastered floor 3 cm. thick. Among the more interesting finds of the Iron Age were five ostraca inscribed in Hebrew and one in Edomite. One of the Hebrew ostraca bears the full names of three persons together with their cities of origin, all in Judea: one in the Negev, the second in the Judean hills and the third in the Shephelah. The Edomite ostracon, which contains six lines, apparently deals with matters of military logistics. (Communicated by Itzhaq Beit Arien and Bruce Cresson) Shiqmim, 1983* The third season of excavations in the Chalcolithic village of Shiqmim was carried out between 26 August and 4 October 1983. The excavation was co-directed by D. Alon and T. Levy on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums and the Negev Museum, Beer sheba. The project was affiliated with the American Schools of Oriental Research and funded by a generous grant from the National Geographic Society, U.S.A. The Ecole Biblique kindly contributed important material help to the project. The field supervisors were Deborah Gammill, Nadine Menahem, Arlene Rosen and N. Slope. The specialist staff consisted of: P. Goldberg, geologist; T. Ludovise, photographer/camp manager; Caroline Grigson, archaeozoologist; M. Kislev, archaeobotanist; Arlene Rosen, plant phytolith studies; D. Mizrachi, camp technician and Shula Hayosh, cook. Students from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and the Universities of Edinburgh, London, Newcastle and Oxford and volunteers from 15 countries formed the work force of the project. The expedition's camp was established with the help of the Negev Emergency Archaeological Survey team on the north bank of the Nahal Beer-sheba adjacent to the Shiqmim village. The main goal of the 1983 season was to make an extensive horizontal excavation in the Shiqmim village, concentrating on the upper building phases of the site. Excavations in 1982 indicated the presence of at least four building phases which extended to a depth of about 2 m. throughout the site. As the upper two building phases are less than 1 m. below the surface, Shiqmim offered a unique opportunity to sample the village for evidence of prehistoric 'town' planning. To achieve this goal, the western portion of the site was divided into four areas (A-D). Each field supervisor was responsible for an initial six excavation units of 5 X 5 m., which were later extended to eight or nine units. Area A is located in the extreme western sector of the site; excavations were carried out here in 1979 and 1982. This area is most important in terms of defining the general stratigraphy at Shiqmim. Observations made in 1982 concerning the building phases were confirmed during the 1983 excavation. This was highlighted in the excavation of Square C/3, where well-defined foundation walls from Building Phases (BP) I and II were found superimposed on one another and separated by about 15 cm. of sediment. The foundation wall of BP II was particularly well preserved; its mud-brick superstructure was about 35 cm. high and extended for 2 m. on wadi cobble foundations. The excavations in Area A now provided the first complete building plan at Shiqmim. In 1982, two incomplete buildings from BP I and BP II were visible in Squares E/2 and E/3. In 1983, a test probe was made between Squares E/2 and E/3 to find the northern wall of the BP II structure. When its foundations were fully exposed, it was defined as a rectangular building (2.5 X 5.5 m.) oriented north-west / south-east. The entrance seems to be on the eastern broad side of the structure. A second building with similar dimensions was found in Squares C/2-C/3 and was also oriented north-west / south-east. The BP I structure associated with the *Cf. above, pp. 132-135.</page><page sequence="20">NOTES AND NEWS 273 first building of BP II was considerably larger and measured about 4.5 X 10 m. In terms of village or town planning, one of the more significant findings was an alley (PI. 32:C) in the western portion of the area. It is approximately 2.5 m. wide and runs north-west / south-east for about 18 m. Buildings were found on both sides of the alley. The foundations of buildings on the western side of the alley appear to be highly eroded, possibly owing to changes in the location of a small secondary drainage channel which borders the western side of the site. Area was opened this season to the south-west of Area A. The initial aims of the excavation here were to enlarge the Shiqmim village plan, to identify differences in building architecture which might be related to social organization and to identify special functions or activities associated with individual structures and spaces. Unfortunately, no complete structures were found. Of the seven walls found in this area all were constructed in different building styles and most ended abruptly on two ends. The foundation stones may have been robbed out of many of these walls. While the architectural plan in Area is problematic, this area contained the most significant small finds. In Square B/18 a remarkable assemblage of thirteen complete pottery vessels was found near a disturbed wall of BP I (PI. 32:D). Most of these vessels were typical Nahal Beer-sheba V-shaped bowls with painted red rims and white bands extending around the upper portion of the bowl. Two pottery forms not previously found in the Negev were also included: a fenestrated holemouth vessel (an incense burner?) and a high-necked bottle which flares at the top in the form of a small V-shaped bowl. Careful sieving of the sediments found in the fenestrated vessel revealed the presence of human bone. The association of these varied pottery types with an unusually small limestone mortar may be important for understanding the use of the vessels in the assemblage. Unfortunately, the context of the assemblage is still not clear, because an insufficient area was excavated around this important feature. The other significant find from Area was a small basalt anthropomorphic statuette head. The head is remarkably similar to the ivory 'Pinocchio' statuette found at Bir es Safadi in the early 1950s by Jean Perrot. These finds will be fully published in the near future. Area C was opened to connect the easternmost excavation area (Area D) with Area A in the west; thus an exposure extending for over 100 m. across the site was made. Area C contained two well-defined buildings, the larger measuring about 5 X 10 m. and the smaller about 3.5 X 5.5 m. The smaller building was not completely excavated; however, a sub-surface oval bin measuring 1.2 m. in maximum outside diameter was found in the north-western corner of the structure. A large basalt bowl with engraved herringbone patterns was also found in this room (Square M/5). A test pit was excavated in Square M/4 to examine the nature of the sediments in the eastern portion of the site. The pit was excavated to a depth of approximately 80 cm. and revealed a similar depositional history to that found in 1982 in Area A (Square G/4). The most interesting feature was a layer of fine sand about 15 cm. thick found approximately 70 cm. below the surface. Similar deposits were found in the G/4 trench in 1982; this may point to periodic flooding of the village during the Chalcolithic period. It is hoped that geological study of the Shiqmim sediments will answer this important question. Area D was the easternmost area excavated in 1983. As in the other areas, the surface was covered by large wadi cobbles and boulders which represent the collapse of Chalcolithic architectural features. The presence of a large rock cairn (about 6 m. in diameter, Locus 1634) on the site's surface was initially thought to represent the collapse of a large building. However, after careful excavation it was clear that the feature was constructed during a much later period, possibly as a marker of some kind. The architectural remains in Area D were of a somewhat different character than those found in Areas A, and C. Area D contains evidence for what may be a courtyard with two rectangular buildings attached to it. In the south-eastern corner of the 'courtyard' was found a small room which may have functioned as a food preparation area. On the floor of this structure a collection of animal bones, chipped stone and several flint</page><page sequence="21">274 NOTES AND NEWS cores were found, perhaps indicating meat preparation. In one of the rectangular rooms on the western side of the 'courtyard' a stone installation of unknown function was found at the southern end of the building; it contained one large boulder with a worked cup mark on the top, surrounded by eight wadi cobbles which formed a perfect circle. The installation may have functioned as a working surface for some kind of craft activity. Soil samples from -the floor associated with this feature may help to define its function. In summary, the 1983 excavations in the Shiqmim village greatly extended the village plan at the site. The most significant observations from the excavation concern the orientation of the foundation walls of the upper two building phases at the site. These walls are all oriented along the same axis which extends across the western portion of the site. This pattern and the range of architectural features found (i.e. buildings ranging from 5x 10 m. to 2.5 X 5 m., an alley, storage facilities, and a possible courtyard) suggest a complex type of village or town planning not previously seen in the Negev.

A Reception in honour of Olga Tufnell, on behalf of the Lachish Archaeological Expedition of the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University, took place on 6 July 1983 in the Expedition's camp near Tel Lachish. Miss Tufnell, who took part in the excavations of Lachish in the 1930s, gave a talk on her reminiscences of archaeologists and archaeological experiences in the Middle East at that early period, which was greatly enjoyed and appreciated by participants from all over the country. The Thirty-seventh Archaeological Con vention of the Israel Exploration Society was held on 26-27 September 1983, at Beth She'arim and in the valley of Megiddo.* The first session of the convention took place in the National Park at Beth She'arim and was chaired by J. Aviram. After his opening remarks, greetings were delivered by Y. Ne'eman, Minister of Science and Development, who deplored the recent vandalism at Beth She'arim and spoke of the reverence due to the dead. He also mentioned the financial assistance to archaeologists extended by his ministry. A. Eitan, Director of Antiquities, brought the greetings of the Department of Antiquities and Museums and spoke on the proposed antiquities law and the absolute need to prevent it. J. Yannai, Chairman of the National Parks Authority, greeted the participants on behalf of the Authority. The following lectures were then delivered: B.
