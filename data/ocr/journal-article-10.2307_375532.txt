<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROGER SALE On Being Not Good Enough ONE WAY TO FEEL not good enough very quickly is to read the work of John Muir, the patron saint of this Yosemite wilderness. Muir, for instance, could go off into the mountains for weeks and months at a time, carrying only a small bedroll and something he called his breadpack, in which he kept stale dry bread, which was his only certain food for as long as three months. He speaks of going out from this valley in the midst of a blizzard and climbing 4000 feet so he could see the snow banners on the mountaintops at their best, right after the blizzard stopped and the north wind was blowing hardest. He called it a long walk from Oakland to Yosemite, not because it was a long way but be- cause there was so much to stop and see en route. Clearly we are not, or at any rate I am not, good enough for that. Most people who live in the west think of themselves as living closer to wilder- ness than people do elsewhere in the country; most of us have a secret pride in our ability to do at least some things well in open, rugged, and high places; most of us are instinctive conservation- ists; most of us knew something or a lot about ecology before it became a popu- lar word. But still, we like this hotel to have heat, light, and water, and we are willing to ignore what wrenching of the landscape it took to give us those things and a good highway to get here to enjoy them. We are spoiled, lovers of wilder- ness, but nowhere near as good as John Muir in accepting it on its own terms. But then, we know, we are not living in Muir's world, except insofar as Muir's world is the Godmade wilderness. When Muir set off from Oakland towards Yosemite, he found, he says, "the great central plain of California, level as a lake, thirty or forty miles wide, four hundred long, one rich furred bed of golden Compositae," and, he adds, "Cat- tle and cultivation were making few scars as yet, and I wandered enchanted in long, wavering curves, aware now and then that Yosemite lay to the east- ward, and that, some time, I should find it." Well, my wife and I got up this morning not far from Oakland, and at the John Muirish time of 5:15, but we caught a plane to get us from San Fran- cisco to Fresno where, in turn, we could hitch a ride here. One might, knowing the petty stresses we put ourselves through, feel a twinge of nostalgia for Muir's method of travel, for its beauti- ful slowness, for the single furred bed of compositae that is now your homes, roads, and airports. If we feel we live on America's frontier, close to the wil- derness, we all know it is frontier at a late stage, comfortable, not wild. Or we might put it this way: the 500 Roger Sale is professor of English at the Uni- versity of Washington and a member of the editorial boards of the Hudson Review and Modern Language Quarterly. He is author of Reading Spenser, On Writing, and Modern Heroism. This article was originally a speech given to the California Association of the Teachers of English at Yosemite Park.</page><page sequence="2">On Being Not Good Enough 501 frontier is what man makes, the wilder- ness is that which is beyond the fron- tier, not yet claimed by us. Living on a frontier is heady, exciting, but we feel proud of being able to do it; living in a wilderness is really more than we can manage, it is for Muir, perhaps, but not many. It isn't, I think, that we mis- conceive of the wilderness. We know wilderness is not chaos, or hell, because it is neither orderless nor infernal, but its ways and means are not ours. Muir did not feel this, not just because he spent so much time wandering in the wilderness, but because his habits of mind were consistently and joyously anthropomorphic in ways we can no longer manage. He did not call this High Sierra a wilderness but the Range of Light, and over and over he sees a world he can make his home because its activi- ties can all be made human. Here he is speaking of rocks at the end of an earth- quake: "after their wild fiery flight, they had come to complete rest. They were slowly settling into their places, grating against one another, groaning and whis- pering," just as though he were describ- ing the present company at the begin- ning of this speech. In Muir's writing trees always have arms, flowers lean confidingly, even the algae in a stream are "fluent, green tresses." Nature in the Yosemite valley "gathered her choicest treasures, whether great or small, to draw her lovers into close and confiding communion with her." Muir was a good scientist, a careful maker of measure- ments, a powerful conservationist, but a simple religious soul, a transcendentalist, able to be at home in the wilderness be- cause it was for him as human as he was. Seen that way, our position on the frontier as we face the wilderness is a little pathetic. We know on the one hand that one of the disasters in the history of the country is the result of people other than John Muir who also felt so at home with their landscape that they made it theirs in destructive ways. They claimed title to any riches the land could offer; they mined, they logged, they built towns, cities, and farms, often or even usually with great care- lessness or indifference to the other needs and orders of nature. Yet if we are now quite aware of this, if we recog- nize the symptoms of human arrogance in our thinking that our needs and wants always come first, we have not really learned what the alternatives are or might be. We do look back with nostal- gia at a figure like Muir, we do wish we could command his superb and unself- conscious oneness with his wilderness, yet we also are wary, mistrusting the consequences of human confidence be- cause of what such confidence has so often created in the way of despoiling. We feel less at home on the earth than we used to, and we do so because we sense we should, yet we don't like it. We are exiles from our human past, yet we have not really found other homes. There are, of course, those who think they know the way out of our dilemma: turn your back on what you have called civilization, discover your models in the American Indians, in men like Muir, in those who have left and lived simply with the land. There are probably more communes in this country today than there have been at any time since the vast utopian communities of the nine- teenth century; there are more students than ever before measuring us squarely, finding us wanting, and heading out; it is possible, says Charles Reich, to green America again, if we just listen to the kids. I suspect that all of us have in the last five years felt edgy, nervous, and defensive when suddenly rebuked by a</page><page sequence="3">502 COLLEGE ENGLISH young voice that defiantly wants to know if we know we are only pawns of a system that maims Vietnamese chil- dren, spills oil, poisons sheep in Wyom- ing with leaking gas, renders a species of animal or bird near extinction on the average of close to one a year, filthies rivers, despoils wilderness in the name of recreation or multiple use. And we are edgy, nervous, and defensive pre- cisely because the unhappy youthful voice is right, because he cannot be labeled neurotic or too young. We might ask him what he is going to do about it all, or what he would like us to do; we might even tell him to get back and finish The Scarlet Letter; we are, nonetheless, stuck, not really able to answer. And at that moment and in- deed in many others like it, we know that the wilderness is suddenly not out there, in the high and lonely country, but right there, in the classroom. Perhaps I am being a little glib here, but it has long seemed to me that what I really know about those two terms with which I began, frontier and wil- derness, I learned mostly in dealing with students, and that, indeed, my sense of my relation with what is more usually called frontier and wilderness has been created and conditioned by my experi- ences as a teacher. And even in my earli- est days as a teacher, when I knew almost nothing about what I was doing, I knew that when I was flattering my- self I thought of my classrooms as fron- tiers, places where human order was be- ing made at the edge of chaos, and when I was feeling low or sorry for myself, my classes were wildernesses, howling, alien messes, where we were all lost. And I am quick to report that wilder- nesses thus experienced were not for me anything like homes or places of glorious retreat, and that whenever I found any evidence that I could flatter myself that I and my students were on the frontier rather than lost in a wilderness, I quite eagerly did so. When you stop to think about it, the image of the classroom as frontier is just about the most attractive one there is. On the frontier the gap between teacher and student, leader and led, is narrowed in ways quite flattering to the leader; on the frontier, we say, we are all learners, we are all open to the un- known, we all seek the free responses of others, we all point the way, but to ourselves as well as to our students. The words we use to describe life on the frontier-expedition, adventure, search- ers in uncharted territory-are precisely the terms we would most like to use about our classes. We love to think of ourselves as being open and generous about experience, brave enough to con- front each class as though it were a new venture into the unknown. Conversely, we reserve our strongest scorn for those among our colleagues who substitute for life on the frontier other images: tight and tightly disciplined teachers who do not let students breathe decently evoke the image of an army boot camp; innocents who want the students to run the show and who end up letting them- selves get trampled, reserve the image of the wilderness. What we want, we know, is the frontier. About one of these images, the boot camp, I will have little to say. Some of you may run, in your classes, to con- tinue the military metaphor, tight ships; some of you may tell your students to shape up or ship out; some of you may teach literature as though it were all a matter of teaching dactyls and trochees, and composition as though the most in- teresting of human faults is the comma splice. But I doubt if there are many</page><page sequence="4">On Being Not Good Enough 503 such here; perhaps there are not many in the world, and in any event we all have known moments enough already when we laughed at what we took to be the overly strict and tight and mechani- mal. The other two images, however, those of frontier and wilderness, I think are worth pursuing at least a little longer, and what I have to suggest about our being not good enough concerns them. I suspect that as recently as last year or two years ago the question of the open or the closed classroom was more on everyone's minds than it is at the moment, and that the reason the prob- lem has become to seem less pressing is that it never was stated very well or confronted very satisfactorily. At least as it filtered down to me, as one who really never read a great deal about it, the issue that was raised got interpreted in essentially political ways. The facts, which I think almost everyone admitted as being true in one way or another, were that an enormous number of American children were enduring many many hours of considerable tedium in our classrooms in order to end up rather poorly educated. The debate or fight may have begun disputing these facts, but it quickly developed to a considera- tion of who or what was to blame and, if the ensuing acrimony allowed for it, what should be done about it. Some not very useful words, like fascist and permissive, repressive and creative, got bandied about a good deal. A teacher would appear who seemed, in the usual sense, to refuse to teach; he sat around with his students, rapped with them, treated or tried to treat them like his or her equals; he seemed to ignore esta- blished procedures, curricula, and sub- ject matter; of course a fight followed. Perhaps he got fired, or was threatened with that if he didn't change. Perhaps he, in return, in effect threatened his threateners with student rebellion. People seemed to take sides. If the per- son did get fired or transferred or eased into a menial post, then teachers, stu- dents, and administrators took sides, argued, fretted, made enemies, made strange allies, worried about whether they themselves were doing the right thing, etc. Perhaps there is a high school or college in the country that never ex- perienced anything like this, but I doubt it. Of course styles and methods differed from place to place, because Turlock is not Berkeley, and McFarlane is not Isla Vista or San Francisco State, but this kind of experience must have been enjoyed or endured by almost everyone involved in American education. And the fight, especially as it got more hos- tile, always was political. Who is in charge here: the students, the individual teacher, the principal or president, the regents or the school board or the governor? And the question of who should be in charge came to be the way we spoke about the question of what was wrong with American schools and what should be done next. Which, I think we now see, was all wrong. We can see that the moment there was a fight it had to be a wrong fight because in a fight people take sides, harden positions, become dogmatic. But it was also a period when the really bad people were called fence-sitters, hedgers, duplicitous, and the like, when it looked as though to take some stand, any stand, was better than to say or do nothing. The ghosts of Nazi Germany and deca- dent Rome were consistently evoked on both sides with great ardor, and we all know that the really bad guys were the silent Germans and the Romans who</page><page sequence="5">504 COLLEGE ENGLISH fiddled while the city burned. Not tak- ing a side, being a crime, forced every- one into feeling political and fretful. Those days have not altogether passed, but they are going, and the real trouble and the real sadness is that their failure to ask the right questions or to seek the right kind of answers means that the experience taught most of us very little, and convinced a great many of us to be even more determined, less flexible, more hard nosed, in the future. There were no victors or vanquished, but I think a lot of people felt just a little more de- feated, a little more tired, above all a little less able to ask, really and freshly, what should have been the questions all along. The students who went through it all seem now a little jaded, a little weary, not really wiser; the teachers seem more wary, fuller of tireder jokes, capable of reducing issues to cliches, able to go about their business, but per- haps even less sure than ever of what that business is. And of course the eco- nomic crunch that has hit the country, but your state and mine perhaps most of all, has not helped one bit, because the crunch creates caution and encour- ages the worst, even the meanest of es- tablishment habits and practices. The whole experience has not, for reasons I want to mention later, been a total dis- aster, but it certainly is easy to recount our history in the last two, three, or four years, and to feel discouraged. I mean to speak of all this unargumen- tatively, because I think that if we all agreed about what were the right terms to use we then probably pretty much agree about what happened; if my terms don't happen to be yours, if my experi- ences lead me to emphasize one thing rather than another, the general trends or patterns are clear enough, and they are not so much my subject here as my occasion. What I am interested in is what I take to be the original situation, and how the images of frontier and wil- derness can help to illuminate it. What occasioned the whole fight, I think, was simply the general sense that we had failed, that we had invested a great deal of the country's energies in classrooms and schools and had done so blindly and confidently, convinced somehow that the processes of educa- tion were holy, needing mostly organi- zation and finances to make them work. We discovered that the processes were not at all holy, that those people we most expected to be able to succeed with, the youth of middle class America, the chil- dren of the postwar boom, we had not succeeded with, and that our failure with them was only a shadow of our failure with the poor, the black, the Chicano. A great many of us had hints in our own consciences and conversa- tions with colleagues that all was far from well, but, as we know, it took the cries of the students themselves to con- vince us. What happened was the dis- covery that we were not good enough, that our flattering ourselves that we lived or tried to live on the frontier was false flattery. The response everyone made to this discovery was, as I have indicated, po- litical, and, as far as I can see, therefore wrong. It attacked the system, it grew afraid of students and their scorn, it de- nounced nabob legislators and smokers of dope. What I think should have been said is that we were, and are, good, but not good enough. We were, and are, good, in lots of ways. We had been given, in effect, the task of being the largest priestly caste in the history of the world; we were quite rightly told that this country meant to educate its entire citizenry and that it was depend-</page><page sequence="6">On Being Not Good Enough 505 ing on us to lead. In all the years I have been teaching I have never been paid remotely as well as some professionals in some other fields, and I have never, as a teacher of English, been paid any- where near as well as some teachers in some other fields. But I have always known that that really was not relevant; the priests and clerics in the great age of the church were the most important people but far from being the most wealthy. I have always known that for every fearful and shy man in the street who thought I lived in an ivory tower there were tens and hundreds who had, and even knew they had, invested their lives in their children and had invested their children in me. Being good, I was flattered; being sensible, I felt a little scared and guilty; being not good enough, I worked hard at developing my strengths and tried to ignore the rest. The image of the frontier was perfect, because it acknowledged the two things that mattered most to me. First, it agreed that I had come from somewhere, in this case, the literary tradition of En- gland and America; second it agreed I was going to somewhere less secure and known, namely the future that my stu- dents would create out of what they learned in my classes. It asked of me that I really know my past and really be able to move into the future that might not value the past anywhere near as much as I did, but I could claim to be able to handle that responsibility and possibility. The presumption of the frontier is that if one works hard and long, is dedi- cated, careful, inventive, scrappy, and courageous one can carve out a life for oneself. He who is on the frontier of anything has to be humble, because he is facing things unknown, but in a way that can also make him proud by virtue of the fact that he got there. If, in our image, we are fellow frontiersmen with our students, we can easily allow them to follow along and then, after a while, begin to lead, because that, we say, is what we want. We might, for instance, insist to them that when they read some- thing older, be it Shakespeare or Mel- ville or even Hemingway, that they need to listen to us because we have been there longer; we might, at the some time, cheerfully acknowledge that when it came to something written by one closer in age to them than to us, say, Thomas Pynchon or Richard Brautigan, that they can tell us what to look for, how to enjoy. If they say that Shakespeare is strictly old hat, we can cheerfully accept that as a challenge and seek ways to make him live for them. But always, life on the frontier seeks to be a community experience, where the pleasures and joys of learning are accepted, where our dif- ferences are exciting because they are what creates the sense of frontier for us. How to create knowledge where there was ignorance, order where there was confusion, taste where there was vul- garity, precision where there was slop- piness; that is the task of the frontiers- man. The difficulty is that on the frontier there is no challenge to anyone's funda- mental sense of value. That we should be carving out our space, that we should be extending the boundaries of the known into the unknown, that we should be the leaders of the expedition- these things one does not question on the frontier precisely because they are so hard to achieve and are so satisfying when they are gained. Ask a man who has spent sixteen hours a day all one spring and summer clearing land, pre- paring soil, planting and growing seed, harvesting a small but adequate crop, if he is despoiling the environment and he</page><page sequence="7">506 COLLEGE ENGLISH will laugh or snort or spit with scorn. He knows the land, has lived intimately with it, has nurtured his small control over it, has become proud of his very humility in the face of it. He should give that up? The more he has succeeded on the frontier, the less he can imagine questioning the value of his labor and his success. It is for that reason, I think, that when the rumblings turned into avalan- ches in our schools it was precisely those who had most prided themselves on their teaching that became most confused. What they were being told, in effect, was that what they had presumed to be their legion and their colleagues, their fellow explorers, were not this but alien systems, obedient to different rhythms and tastes, wary of efforts to make them obedient to anything else. Those who never had thought of classrooms as frontiers, those who had always thought that students were an alien form of life that had to be harnessed, directed, and controlled-in other words, the reac- tionaries-they were in many respects less surprised than the frontiersmen be- cause they had always said that students needed great discipline to avoid becom- ing as alienated and as foreign as the students started saying they in fact were. The reactionaries, of course, had every- thing else wrong, because they neither knew what had happened nor cared to seek any solutions, but their sense of satisfaction at learning that the frontiers- men were being skewered by their stu- dents had some real justification. What had happened, in effect, was that what had been frontier was sud- denly declared to be a wilderness. As I said at the beginning, a wilderness is not chaos and it is not infernal, but it is distinctly alien to that aspect of the person which makes him a frontiersman, who worked so hard and so well at doing what he was doing that he had no time to question the value of his labor. But the wilderness does question the fron- tiersman, and in the form of weeds and thunderstorms and rampant growths it even rebukes him. I am comfortable with the image of the student as potential colleague; I am nervous with the image of the student as alien. If I can claim that I have challenged the unknown in class, that I have reclaimed one group of stu- dents from ignorance by reclaiming the soil that is Shakespeare, then I can go home happy at night. If I feel that my best effort is being rebuked, and not just by those students I might call inveterate weeds but by those who would rather be, shall we say, dense undergrowth rather than cleared land, then I am nervous, and I go home in need of a drink. I can live on the frontier with those who say they are bored with Shakespeare, but find it hard to live in the wilderness of those who insist there is no need to read him even to find out if they are bored or not; I can live on the frontier with the student who tells me he can like no author who lived before this century, but struggle in the wilderness of those who say no good novel matters as much as a good movie by Alfred Hitchcock, and who proves this by doing perfunctory work in a literature course with me and superlatively in a course in film; if these examples won't do, then think of the angry and sullen blacks, or Chicanos, or women, who suddenly announce there is no frontier where I am, only swampland and scrub pine. In response to the discovery that the classroom may be a wilderness, one can do one or two things quite easily. One can, many tried, in effect, to go alien, to join the students, to try not teaching</page><page sequence="8">On Being Not Good Enough 507 in any of its more usually recognized forms, to become non-directed, to let the students pursue their alienness. If what seemed a nationwide system of standing up in front of classes and di- recting the show had led to bankruptcy, then the solution might well be to back off and out, to cease trying to bring stu- dents over to where one already was, to go limp or silent. One high school teach- er of my acquaintance seems to have had great success by getting all the old chairs out of his room, replacing them with smaller chairs around circular tables, on which were placed books, magazines, and records. The students read what they pleased, or not read as they pleased; they were free totally to ignore the teacher, or to ask him ques- tions, seek his advice, show him things they'd written. A quiet, shy man tem- peramentally, he made virtues out of potential vices. The trouble, as we all know, is that very few teachers do this sort of thing well, and very few school systems seem able to tolerate even the successful ones. In a great many cases where teachers tried this kind of thing, the students got nervous and rebelled or walked away, wasted a lot of time, felt encouraged to believe that doing noth- ing was as good as doing something, or that doing any one thing was as good as doing any other thing. Very few stu- dents handle that much freedom very well, though those who do are, admit- tedly, very impressive people. Very few teachers, too, know how to live well as aliens; most end up embarrassing stu- dents by giving the appearance of trying to be adolescents themselves. The other obvious possible response to the discovery of the classroom as wilderness is to ignore the fact and to go right ahead and work with those stu- dents, who seldom number less than fifty per cent of any class, who want school to be boot camp or frontier. A teacher who doesn't try to listen very hard to his students can even feel that, after all, most students really want to be told what to do anyway, that it is only a vocal minority who make classes seem wildernesses. I suspect that in the last year or so, when most schools seem to have calmed down a bit, many teach- ers have settled for the notion that the old ways are the best ways after all, and rely on the fact that no student has been throwing things at him lately as proof. Given slight adjustments here or there, many teachers have gone back to The Scarlet Letter and to circling comma faults, secure in the knowledge that there seems always to be a majority of stu- dents who will not object and a minority who seem to learn under such regimes. But I think that both these responses- in effect, that of abdicating from the traditional role of the teacher and that of insisting on it-are not good-enough. Of course every teacher must do what he can do, and we all inevitably gravi- tate towards approving those methods which best suit our temperaments; of course, too, no one wants to feel very secure ever in telling anyone else how to teach or not teach a class. What works works, what fails fails, and teach- ing is always such a terribly hard busi- ness that only ogres or fools would tell any teacher to ignore the few and hard- won successes he has achieved. When I say that I do not think we are good enough, I do not mean to ignore the fact that many, probably most, of us are really quite good. I mean, rather, that very few teachers ever really come to terms with the fact that their class- rooms may well be wildernesses. Let me be a little more explicit on this point. One of the major things we all</page><page sequence="9">508 COLLEGE ENGLISH share is a love of literature and an ad- miration for good writing; these sustain us, often, when little else seems to do so, and when we do not feel the importance of good literature and good writing we inevitably become less good teachers. One consequence of this is that we all are a little old-fashioned, even reaction- ary; our historical imaginations take us back further in time than most people, even most educated people, can go, and we all love literature or other writing of other ages in such a way that we come to respect and love the past for its own sake. We have no recourse but to think, at times, that we are the repositories of certain cultural values and facts that, without us, may well be lost or ignored or abused. Some teachers like to pride themselves on their elegant and fasti- dious use of English; others feel they can recreate a sense of some historical moment such that students will see some- thing they would never have known or valued otherwise; still others look for- ward to a chance to read aloud some passage of poetry or prose because they know they do it well and can implant in others a sense of the potential power and beauty of great writing. These powers and prides of ours, as I say, do sustain us as well as make us a little old- fashioned, even reactionary, and we know that whatever other memories of teaching success we know we do not forget those students who seem, under our guidance, to come to love and ad- mire what we love and admire; such students are rare, and we know we can- not teach just for their sake, but we do not forget them. But our relation to the past on the one hand and to our students on the other is, it seems to me, inevitably a wilderness relation. If there is one thing we know about America it is that it has always seemed dedicated to trying to throw off the past, to make it new, not just to rendering the Compositae of Muir's central valley unrecognizable eighty years later but the landscapes of our own childhoods as well. History in Europe and the orient has been for cen- turies something of a totem, the past and its traditions have been honored and maintained; in America we are con- stantly shucking off the past, telling others to get into the twentieth century, using "old-fashioned" as a term of dis- approval, peering anxiously into the future. What we have come to call gene- ration gaps have always existed, but my guess is that the gaps have always been wider in America than in England or China, and that they may have gotten wider still as the country has grown great and powerful and able to throw away its past at ever-increasing rates. For the first time in our history Ameri- cans are living in a country where al- most everyone is native born, more American than anything else, and this is bound to lead to a greater sense on the part of those who embody one older tradition or another that all tradi- tions are being obliterated in contempo- rary American experience. You are said to live in a state where all this is more true than anywhere else in the country, but even if this is true your experience is only more typically American, not more extreme. What I have just said, about the col- lective relative old-fashionedness and the experience of being American, is fear- fully simplified and something no one can possibly accept except as general truths subject to countless individual modifications. But insofar as the general truths are true, they will explain the fact of wilderness. Our students are not cultural barbarians, but they are more</page><page sequence="10">On Being Not Good Enough 509 apt than students elsewhere in the world or at other times in the past to be with- out a sense of the past or of traditions. Some, obviously, need no more of this than does a tree, or a robin; most, equally obviously, are simply very unsure about what they need. Their culture is im- mensely a matter of the present tense; the more articulate and historically con- scious can look back on events of five years ago as though they belonged to a different era. A friend of mine is teach- ing a course on the year 1968 and reports that the students, all freshmen in college, can treat 1968 as though it were almost ancient history. Which is, by the way, something you and I cannot do, or can- not do anywhere near as well. The possible proofs and ramifications of these assertions could take us off in lots of different directions. Here I would only like to speculate on the way this creates effects very much like that of a wilderness. On a frontier you seek to move from the known to the unknown; in a wilderness you acknowledge every- thing as pretty much unknown and do not greatly value that little bit which is known to you. On a frontier people huddle and work together to create space for themselves; in a wilderness one moves more softly and humbly, trying to understand an alien ecology. The question is not, it seems to me, should we treat ourselves as frontiersmen or as the descendants of wilderness men like John Muir, but rather, are we good enough to make our way in the wilder- ness? The frontier, as I read it, is closed. I love history, adore the past, much prefer reading A.J.P. Taylor describing diplomatic crises between Russia and Turkey in the 19th century to reading The New Republic, feel at least as much at home with the 19th century novel or the 17th century drama as I do with the works of Richard Brautigan or Leonard Cohen. I know how to live thinking that way, but I'm not sure I know how to teach, and I'm really not sure that I'm good enough to teach with full knowl- edge of my own cultural proclivities and their relation to those of my stu- dents clearly before me. I'm not a tree, or a robin, any more than I'm an ado- lescent American, and there's little point in my trying to pretend that I wouldn't like all my students to revere the past as I do. But I know better; they are, if not trees or robins, adolescent Americans, and they simply cannot be treated as though the mature Americans they will become will make them like me. If 1968 is ancient history to them, 1990 is totally mysterious to me; free from history, freeing themselves from the past, my students need not ever come to terms with me, my English, my sense of the past. And I suspect that I am simply not good enough really to face that. The place, I suspect, where we all might agree to what I have just been saying is in courses in composition or writing where very little literature is read and students are able to speak more directly of the culture they live and create. In the first place, there it is at least more possible for those visibly oppressed by the world that created the traditions I love-namely, the blacks, the poor whites, the Chicanos and Indians, increasingly, the women-to speak di- rectly; in the second place, there is where most teachers seek to have all stu- dents speak in whatever is their own language. The moment there is any reading, the moment the course is avowedly literary, at that moment I am on pretty safe, old-fashioned ground, the frontier of teaching Shakespeare to those bored with Shakespeare. But in writing courses the sense of wilderness is every-</page><page sequence="11">510 COLLEGE ENGLISH where and needs only small encourage- ment and politeness from any decent teacher to get to the surface. To survive one travels light, which means forgetting comma faults or remembering them only at those very rare moments when some wilderness voice wants them ex- plained; one points to this and objects to that, gains a foothold here and loses it there; one loves the students who say what one has wanted to say, but in a different and more appropriate language, as though one's own language had been sung by a bird; one regrets the lack of any consistent focus and wonders what will happen if some focus isn't gained and sustained, yet knows that in a wilderness "focus" may be another word for despoiling. It's the most nerve- wracking work in the world. During the last two summers I have taught writing to high school students, and the class met at 8: 30 in the morning and I felt by 9: 30 that I had put in a full day's work. I hope, thus, that you can see that when I speak of our being not good enough I am not admonishing anyone at all, not even myself, but only finding a new way to issue a challenge. I am sug- gesting, first, that we do and will con- tinue to teach in wilderness, and that it will probably be very difficult to get over the sense that we are frontiersmen, making our way, creating our space, doing our bit for culture and literature and tradition. I am, of course, also sug- gesting that we are not trees or birds or waterfalls or adolescents and were not meant to be. I am suggesting, finally, that the task is to do many things at once: be proud of who we are and of the heritage we love; be clear that our stu- dents are not barbarians in need of culti- vation but mutations and developments of ourselves that make them alien, ordered, impossible; be just to ourselves, our literature and our language, at the same time that we are just to those for whom these things are alien; be able to see that we are probably not good enough to do these things, and be able to see that our next task is to find out how to live with those facts. John Muir could live for months out of a bread- pack, and he could lighten his load by insisting that nothing around him was alien. I think we need to acknowledge the ways in which we live among the alien, remembering that the alien is not the chaotic, the infernal, or the de- structive, and somehow to see how to live, as it were, by bread alone.</page></plain_text>
