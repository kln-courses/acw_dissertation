<plain_text><page sequence="1">A New Laboratory Device for Passenger Car Safety Studies W. G. Cichowski Proving Ground Section, General Motors Corp. Paper No. 663A presented March 1963 at the National Automobile Meeting IT IS OBVIOUS that the dynamics of an automobile and its occupants during an accident are extremely complex. It is useful, therefore, in passenger car safety studies, to create a simplified standard accident. This "simplified accident" must closely simulate actual accidents, and must also be readily repeatable. One of the earliest "simplified accident" tests, also one of the easiest to perform, is the simple barrier collision. Such tests were first conducted at the General Motors Prov- ing Ground in 1933. In the barrier collision, the number of variables is at a minimum, and the test can easily be re- peated with another vehicle. Unfortunately, this method has one overwhelming disadvantage: an expensive vehicle is destroyed in every test. The Snubber Shortly after World War II, we began to seek a means of reproducing the head-on impact vehicle deceleration, with- out destroying the test vehicle. After learning of an ar- rangement used by an aircraft company for evaluating shoul- der harnesses, seats and fuselage cabin sections, we designed and built a much higher capacity version of this equipment, nicknamed "the snubber," for automotive testing. This unit is illustrated in Fig. 1. The constants of the snubber were chosen so that the re- sulting deceleration pulse was similar to that found during a barrier impact. This equipment produces repeatable de- celerations, ranging from a few g's up to 35 g on full size cars. It consists of a pair of hydraulic cylinders, a relief valve, preset air pressure, and a reservoir. In operation, the test car is towed up to a predetermined test speed, pulling an attached cable through the snubber until the cable end contacts the cross head connecting the two hydraulic cylinders. The test car then separates auto- matically from the tow car and begins its deceleration. The forces set up in the cable are resisted by hydraulic pressure in the cylinders, up to a level predetermined by the relief valve. When the pressure is sufficient to operate the relief valve, the oil flows from the cylinder to the rectangular res- ervoir atop the snubber. This controlled hydraulic pressure results in a predictable and repeatable force being trans- mitted through the cable to the test car, producing the de- sired deceleration. Fig. 1 - Hydraulic snubber Abstract - The Proving Ground Section of General Motors Corp. has installed, and is using, a new fullscale impact machine for simulating vehicle crash conditions. The device is unique in the automotive industry having been provided with the capacity for the indoor testing of complete vehicle struc- tures to an acceleration of 40 g . Vehicle components can be subjected to even higher accelerations. The machine is also unique in that the test vehicle or component is subjected to an acceleration pulse rather than the equivalent deceleration shock. The installation has been equipped with modern instru- mentation for precise recording of test conditions. This in- cludes high level illumination for the high speed photo- graphic coverage. 363</page><page sequence="2">364 W. G. CICHOWSKI Like all equipment, the snubber has certain inherent dis- advantages. First, it is an outdoor facility; tests must be planned around weather. Because of the need for high speed moving pictures, sunlight conditions are particularly criti- cal; Secondly, the control of the test is limited by the short available travel of the cylinders, changes of viscosity of the oil with temperature, and the minimum distance available to reach and stabilize test speed. Because of these limita- tions , we have , for some time , been searching for a better means of conducting safety tests on vehicle components, in- cluding complete bodies. The Impact Sled In the fall of 1961, while working on a design for dy- namic seat belt testing equipment, we found a device on the market that seemed to fill most of our requirements. Originally designed to shock- test military components, the equipment was both well developed and very simple in prin- ciple. Investigation showed that a large unit, capable of testing a 5000 lb payload with a maximum stroke of 5 ft, could be built to meet our specifications. This has been done. This device, called the Impact Sled (Fig. 2) dupli- cates the longitudinal deceleration conditions of an im- pact -- but in reverse. In an actual crash, and in tests with the snubber, the test vehicle moves at a constant velocity and is stopped very rapidly. With the Impact Sled, the test vehicle is instead accelerated very rapidly. However, the effect is similar to an actual crash, since the time- acceler- ation curve is essentially the same in either case. To illustrate further the relationship of an actual head-on vehicle impact to this method of testing, this explanation is offered: just prior to an actual head-on impact, the vehicle and its occupants are traveling at some finite velocity; there is no motion or deceleration of the passengers relative to the vehicle (see Fig. 3). Then, at the instant of impact, the inertia or resistance ot the object impacted decelerates the vehicle, but the passengers retain their original velocity, and thus suddenly develop motion relative to the vehicle. In a test on the Impact Sled, the vehicle and occupants are at rest prior to impact; again, there is no motion of the passengers relative to the vehicle. A force which duplicates the wave form of an actual impact is then applied to the vehicle, accelerating it in the same direction as the applied Fig. 2 - Impact Sled force. The passengers momentarily remain in place, and, just as in the actual head-on impact, develop motion rela- tive to the vehicle. The vehicle is now at a high velocity rather than at zero velocity, as at the termination of an ac- tual impact. Fig. 4 illustrates the basic operating principle of the Im- pact Sled. The device consists of a long tube with an orifice at its approximate midpoint. A piston and a thrust column which extend through a packing gland at the end of the cyl- inder are located on one side of the orifice. This piston has an G ring which rests on the edge of the orifice plate. The piston walls are also sealed by O rings. The pressure in Chamber A is called the "set pressure" and may vary from a few to several hundred psi. The "load pressure" is per- mitted to increase in Chamber B, and, even though this air pressure becomes higher than the "set pressure" in Chamber A, it will not move the piston because of the reduced piston area upon which it can act. The ratio of the piston area ex- posed to the high pressure air to that exposed to the low pres- sure air is approximately 7:1.

This will cause the piston to raise off the O ring slightly, which immediately allows the high pressure air to act on the whole area of the piston face, resulting in an immediate imbalance of forces and rapid motion of the piston. This piston then drives the external test object through the piston rod or thrust column. The rate at which the force is applied to the piston can be controlled by throt- tling the air flow through the orifice with a metering pin attached to the face of the piston. By varying metering pin contours, a wide variety of flow rates and resulting force wave shapes can be produced. As the piston moves to the end of the chamber, the initial set air is further compressed and serves to snub the piston to a gradual stop. The piston stroke is adjusted by varying the set volume and the energy available is adjusted by similarly changing the load volume. In actual practice, firing is accomplished by bringing the load pressure up to a point just below the natural firing point and then momentarily admitting high pressure air between the piston face and the orifice plate. This enables us to fire the device at a predetermined instant, which is a require- ment when synchronizing with instrumentation. Since all energy is supplied by compressed air controlled by orifices and volumes, this equipment gives predictable and repeat - able acceleration levels and wave shapes. The large 91 ton concrete block houses the load chamber and serves as the base to oppose the thrust, which can range as high as 300,000 lb. The set chamber is bolted to the load cylinder and the concrete block through the front base plate. The orifice plate is sandwiched between the flange rings of the load and set cylinders. The stainless steel load and set cylinders are identical, both 12 ft long, 12 in. (ID) x 14 in. (OD). The thrust column which transmits force to the test specimen is made of 5 7/8 in. dia aluminum tubing -- alu- minum, to minimize the inertia of the moving components of the actuator. Test specimens are bolted to the sled shown under the vehicle in Fig. 2. The upper side of the sled is drilled and tapped with a series of holes to facilitate mounting. Slip- pers on the bottom of the sled guide and support it on the track. Built into each of the four slippers are four individ- ual brake pistons, which are faced with a friction material. Once the high acceleration test phase is accomplished, the brakes gradually decelerate the sled within the 100 ft of track provided for this purpose. Instrumentation In scientifically conducted crash tests, much information is obtained through the analysis of high speed movies taken of the action. During testing, we cover the action from sev- eral angles with many cameras, both stationary units and special high impact types, mounted on the test vehicle (Fig. 5). In the past , most of our high speed photography work on crash tests has been conducted at frame speeds of from 500 to 2500 frames per second. These speeds have sometimes been limited by the available light level outdoors. On the new test facility we use 64 individual 1500 w incandescent floodlights in two banks, mounted on panels suspended over the main test area to cover the first 20 ft of rail. These lights give an illumination of over 10,000 ft-c measured at the subject, and will enable the taking of high speed color motion pictures at film rates as high as 3000 frames per second . In addition to the high speed photographic coverage of each crash test, the Proving Ground uses other types of in- strumentation. The basic equipment, housed in a vehicle as shown in Fig. 6, consists of two 18 channel recording os- CAMERA LOCATIONS 5 O ft D* 'aÁ OVERHEAD CAMERA * Ū Fig. 5 - Typical camera locations Fig. 6 - Instrumentation van</page><page sequence="4">366 W. G. CICHOWSKI cillographs, plus the necessary signal conditioning electronic gear. This equipment monitors and records various strains, accelerations, and contacts that occur to the test object dur- ing the test. The equipment is permanently installed and the van is used on outdoor tests as well as on the Impact Sled facility. A specially constmcted timing synchronizer, which coordinates the high speed cameras with the oscillograph equipment, is used so all of our data can be referenced to one time base. This equipment was put into operation in October, 1962, and some of the data obtained from it to illustrate its action is presented here. Door Latch The integrity of the vehicle passenger compartment dur- ing an impact depends, among other things, upon the doors remaining shut. Careful monitoring of the forces applied to door latch assemblies during accidents, such as car-to- car impacts and roll-overs, indicated the magnitude of the motion and loads applied, the most severe being the longi- tudinal loading caused during car-to-car side impacts. In cooperation with the Fisher Body Division, we built the device shown in Fig. 7 to duplicate this longitudinal loading. Test sections representative of the door and pillar structure are cut from the vehicle and mounted on fixtures which slide in a track. The motion of these two parts is restrained by a drawbar which monitors the load caused by the rapid acceleration of the test sled. Large weights have been added to the pillar section so that high inertia loads may be applied at lower g values. The longitudinal load applied by the pillar is transmitted to the door through the door latch assembly. The inertia load of the door must, of course, be subtracted from the total drawbar load. A high speed motion picture camera is mounted on the sled to monitor the action of the door latch. These pictures prove invaluable in determining the origin of any failures which may occur. The shock absorbers, mounted on the fixture, act in one direction only. They are used to prevent the ramming back Fig. 7 - Door latch tester together of the parts after separation, which would destroy the samples. Other door latch mechanisms may be mounted on the sled in any orientation to determine how inertia af- fects their operation. Passenger Compartment One of the first test series conducted on the facility after its trial runs was an evaluation of front seat passenger kine- matics. We were especially interested in comparing the motions of the dummies on impact sled tests with those re- corded in previous barrier, snubber, and car -to -car impacts. A partial vehicle body was mounted on the sled as shown in Fig. 8. The targets on the head, shoulder, waist, and knee of the dummy and on the vehicle are used for calibration and anal- ysis of the high speed motion pictures taken of the tests. Figs. 9-12 illustrate one method of presenting the data from such a series. These figures show the motions of travel of the passenger dummy with and without seat belts at 5, 10, 15 and 20 g . The motion of the dummies during these tests was closely similar to dummy motion previously seen in ac- tual full scale vehicle testing. With motion analysis like this, the points of impact of the dummy can be determined, as well as the velocity and direction of the impact. The dots on the drawings indicate the starting point of the dummy and the location of these points when his head had reached its farthest point forward. Clearly, information like this can be quite beneficial to a designer who has to allow for both the restrained and un- restrained passengers. At the 5 g impact, the simulated re- laxed passenger penetrated the windshield and contacted the lower dash with his knees. Giving the lower dash a flat area would spread out the load application area and mini- mize possible injury. As the g level is increased, the dum- my's path tends to become more straight ahead, and the restrained passenger must be given a clearance for his head, as shown in Fig. 10. As the stretch of the belt and the com- pression of the seat cushion increase further, at the higher g levels the passenger's head now comes into contact with the dash, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Peak seat belt loop loads are recorded just as the torso begins to rotate forward. The unrestrained passenger, at these higher g levels, compresses Fig. 8 - Partial vehicle body mounted on Impact Sled</page><page sequence="5">PASSENGER CAR SAFETY STUDIES 367 the dash further with his knees. Also, his head penetrates the windshield further. Plotting of the dummy kinematics is just one phase of the data analysis of this type of test. One test, lasting 120 msec, can keep two technicians busy for 40 hr, analyzing the oscillograph and movie film records. This data can then be fed into a high speed computer, which will compute and plot the vector resultants of the velocity and acceleration traces for the various parts of the passengers. Figs. 13 and 14 are plots of the performance of the pas- senger seat belt during the test described. These two curves present a clear view to the designers as to the actual load and angle their seat belt anchors must withstand. Notice how the seat belt horizontal angle decreases from the ac- cepted 45 deg static test angle. A dynamic test like this brings out the parameters present in an actual head-on im- pact. Dynamic Testing of Seat Belts Most test procedures in current use for testing seat belts are of a static type, although the California Vehicle Code includes a section on dynamic testing for approval prior to use or sale of belts in that state. In the past we have con- ducted dynamic seat belt tests both in the laboratory and on a fixture on the snubber. A fixture for our impact sled has now been built, to duplicate the requirements for the dy- namic test section of the California Code. Fig. 15 shows this fixture on the sled. The rapid acceleration of the sled causes the body form to load the test seat belt looped around it. The tension placed on the seat belt is measured at each anchor by load transducers, while a displacement transducer measüres the motion of the body block, giving a measure- ment of the elongation or stretch of the belt assembly. Ac- celerometers on the body block and the sled monitor their actions. The rubber bumpers are used to decelerate the body block in case of a bolt failure. By careful regulation of the load pulse applied to the sled, it is possible to duplicate the original California de- sign criteria of 20 g applied for 50 msec. An example oí this is shown in Fig. 16.

On occasion seat belt assemblies that have passed the usual static loop load test have been found to have different load characteristics when placed on this dynamic tester. We have observed inertia opening characteristics of buckles, as well as actual burning through of the webbing where it rubbed with the buckle hardware. 50 I - z ' load / Co o z ' r ' / / o 5 ¡2 40 A- ' r /īrA// ' 0 1 £ ' /Y/^L 1 O V ' &lt;=&lt;/ ANGLE ï O o V V ' V_Z &lt;=&lt;/ ANGLE i 5 1 30 UJ ^ , -i ' O ' z &lt; ' 20 -L^J 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 SEAT BELT LOOP LOAD - POUNDS Fig. 14 - Seat belt angle versus loop load Fig. 15 - Dynamic seat belt tester 6000 LBS J - J J - J / V BELT LOOP LOAD 0 MllWIll 409 i i /X i i i i i i i / ' BQDY BLOCK ACCELERATION o Hl / I ' TĪ4-I BQDY BLOCK ACCELERATION I I I 209 zCTTKL mmii „ L / Yu S.

The angle of orientation of a vehicle on the impact sled to re- construct a side impact is such a generalization. Shown in Fig. 18 is a vehicle mounted at 90 deg to the direction of action of the impact sled. True, this does not duplicate the complex action and interaction of two vehicles involved in a side impact; however, we are able to produce one basic acceleration which is very repea table. Very high outboard loads can be applied, for example, on the door structures. Passenger restraint systems can also be evaluated. Rear Impacts Rear impacts can be duplicated by reversing the test ve- hicle on the impact sled as shown in Fig. 19. The contro- versially named "neck whiplash injury" often results from this type of impact. 8000 1 i i i i i 1 BARRIER IMPACT TEST - 33 MPH «/&gt; ^ G.M.

The passengers' torsos are flexibly supported by the cushion and seat back, while their heads and necks protrude above the seat with no support. The ve- hicle is accelerated by the impact, while the passengers lag behind because of the spring mass system present. Finally, the seat back provides sufficient force to accelerate their bodies; but now their heads are left behind. The initial shearing action of the neck, followed by the rear rotation and, finally, the snubbing of the head in the rearmost posi- tion, are believed to cause the injuries. The studies conducted to date, both in actual rear end impacts and with the use of this new facility, have been quite fruitful. The acceleration pulse of the lower differential velocity elastic impacts is markedly different from that of the higher differential velocity plastic impacts. These pulses have been reproduced with the sled and such things as seat back height and strength have been evaluated. Steering Wheel Tests Dynamic testing of steering wheels has been greatly sim- plified by the use of the impact sled . The test fixture is simply bolted on the sled (Fig. 20), the steering wheel height, angle, and distance from the simulated driver are easily adjusted. Measurements can be made of the loads imposed upon the steering wheel along three axes. Upward Fig. 19 - Rear impact Fig. 20 - Steering wheel tester bending of the column is duplicated by a large bearing and spring arrangement. The motions of a driver during a head- on impact are simulated by the dummy, and knee- dash in- volvement is duplicated by a force modulating system at- tached to the knees. Kinematics of the dummy used on this fixture are derived from actual barrier impact tests. The usual cases of steering wheel performance investigated are collapse or crush rate, and failures or fractures of the ma- terial. This is one of many areas where knowledge of human tolerance levels is lacking. If the rim and spokes are too malleable, they will be deformed easily with little energy absorption; if the rim is too stiff, high occupant decelera- tion may occur. Engine Mounts Engine and transmission motions during minor impacts can also be studied on the impact sled. Short, high rate of onset, low g, elastic, vehicle bumper contacts tend to pro- duce oscillations of the engine, causing damage to the radiator by the fan or, even worse, distortion of the throttle linkage. Fig. 21 is a view of an engine and transmission mounted on the sled for simulation of a rear impact. Windshields The Cornell Automotive Crash Injury Research Project (If. with its accident data collection system and studies, has indicated that windshield -caused head injury is high in order of relative importance. We have assembled a fixture and have conducted an extensive series of tests of head- windshield impacts. Fig. 22 is a view of a partial vehicle body installed on the sled; the net on the front of the ve- hicle body is used to catch large glass sections and prevent them from causing damage to the sled rails. Motion of the dummy during the acceleration pulse is guided and restricted ♦Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper.

Glass breakage characteristics and the dummy head penetration are closely monitored by the high speed movie camera mounted on the side of the vehicle body. In one particular series of tests to evaluate the lacerative or cutting properties of the glass, a special dummy head de- veloped by General Motors and others was utilized. This special head consists ot a standard aluminum dummy skull, first covered with styrofoam, then by a goat skin outer cov- ering. The resiliency and muscle tone of the human head were not duplicated , but the cuts produced on the goat skin were quite similar to those seen by some physicians on the heads of actual accident victims. Tests were run at increasing acceleration rates until the dummy head penetrated the windshield to the shoulders. Fig. 23 is a plot of the head velocity relative to the windshield, necessary for different depths of penetration. The charac- teristics of the windshield breakage changed markedly as the head velocity increased. At first, cracks appeared, ex- tending radially from the point of contact. As penetration increased, the interlayer began to tear vertically down the Fig. 22 - Windshield tester 10 m / X UJ 7.5 -J- / UJ / Z / z / ī 50 &lt; oc / H- IAJ Z Q. 2.5 / 7^ Q. / o ¿ 14 18 22 26 30 34 HEAD VELOCITY AT GLASS CONTACT FT/SEC Fig. 23 - Head velocity versus head penetration of windshield windshield; next, flaps, like pieces of pie, folded out, tear- ing the interlayer. When the differential velocity reached approximately 25 ft /sec, large chunks of glass were being pushed out with the head. At head velocities of 33 ft /sec and over, the hole punched out by the head was so large and the penetration so great that the severity of the lacerations on the head decreased . The head deceleration during these tests was monitored. Fig. 24 is an example of a typical time -deceleration curve. Note the small initial acceleration of the head caused by the torso rotation effected by the knees contacting the in- strument panel, then the sharp spike as the head first con- tacts the glass. The glass then fractures and the head pushes out the glass. Summary We have presented these examples of the different types of tests that can be conducted on this new facility, not as exhaustive studies, but merely to show its versatility. It should be emphasized that the Impact Sled is intended to supplement our overall crash testing program; it will not re- place many forms of full scale vehicle impact or rollover tests. This new facility has already become an extremely valuable laboratory tool for precise and repeatable safety testing of vehicles and vehicle components.

Severy University of California at Los Angeles SIMULATIONS, whether they are motorist simulation, as for example, the anthropometric dummy; vehicular perform- ance simulation, as for example, the vehicle ride simula- tors, or vehicle crash simulators, as described by Mr. Ci- chowski, have three basic features in common that make them an attractive research tool. First, they provide an opportunity to isolate a specific variable from a multivariant environment and subject it to intensive study under reasonably realistic conditions, with- out contamination from undefined, and at times, unidenti- fied variables. The second feature is that well designed simulators, where appropriately applied, provide opportunity for repeatability of experiments, usually at costs substantially below full scale inquiry. A study at depth, of a specific problem, becomes feasible and may be accompanied by validity checks, in those applications where it is possible to compare findings with real world observations. The third basic advantage is safety. Simulators by and large are safer research tools than full scale inquiry; we don't expect anyone to get hurt in a ride simulator. The crash simulator obviously is a more hazardous operation, but even so, it surely is more readily controllable than the com- plex operations of full scale crash experiments. The General Motors crash simulator is capable of accel- erations of vehicle structures to 40 g's. Excellent opera- tional specifications have been selected because this simu- lator is capable of duplicating: 1. The collision environment exposures of two cars strik- ing each other directly head-on, each traveling at about 40 mph. 2. The conditions for a rear-end collision at differential velocities considerably in excess of -40 mph. 3. Intersection collision speeds greater than 50 mph for the striking car. The predictive accuracy of these simulations, for the types of impacts just mentioned, is not uniform. The head- on collision can be simulated with the greatest accuracy, the intersection collision with least accuracy, with respect to passenger compartment safety and structural integrity. The reason for these differences is thát intersection colli- sions frequently involve direct contact by the striking car with the passenger compartment. The multiplicity of fac- tors that operate during direct car intrusion are difficult to simulate without the conditions approaching the complexity of full scale experimentation. In addition, motion on the part of the struck car modifies the subsequent collision dynamics from those possible to simulate by the General Motors device. Intersection -type collisions simulated by the General Motors device refer to the struck car as being stationary and impacted at its center of gravity. However, General Motors has excellent facilities for conducting full scale collision experiments to permit study of those con- ditions not readily duplicated by their crash simulator. Mr. Cichowski recognizes this limitation of the simulator by his comment, "True, this does not duplicate the complex action and interaction of two vehicles involved in a side impact." Even with the favorable weather conditions in Califor- nia, we are hard put to duplicate the excellent lighting con- ditions which GMC has provided for their simulator. Our operations must be scheduled for the period of day when the sun is close to zenith; this limits us to the hours from 11 to 2:30. Technological difficulties at times require delay un- til the following day for a run because of decreasing after- noon lighting. The General Motors crash simulator can be operated even during the night with equally acceptable re- sults. Considering these strong features of crash simulation, the question may naturally be raised, why, after 13 years of collision research, hasn't the UCLA collision research pro- ject come up with its own crash simulator? As a matter of fact, we have three crash simulators, although collectively they are not as useful a research tool as the single General Motors device described in Mr. Cichowski 's paper. On three separate occasions, following full scale inquiry, the UCLA project devised crash simulators to permit isolation and in- tensive study of a particular aspect of vehicular collision performance. In one instance, for example, the inertial ac- tion of the door latch mechanism was subjected to intensive study by mounting complete car doors on a specially con- structed sled, accelerating them down a 600 ft track, and bringing them to an abrupt stop as the sled's arrester pene- trated a sand bin. The UCLA's Series II intersection collision experiments revealed car side glass breakage problems that led to our</page><page sequence="10">372 W. G. CICHOWSKI most comprehensive laboratory study to date: complete cai doors are mounted in simulated door casings and the side glass subjected to impacts by simulated human head forms and other type impacting objects. Our vehicle roll-ovei tests provided stimulus for a more intense observation of the external action of road and ground forces on the door latcb button in explaining door latch self opening during roll- overs. For this simulation, the entire car was elevated by a specially designed jig and allowed to depress in packed soil. It was then reelevated and the door was found to self open by this interaction with the terrain. Through this simulation technique, it was possible to eliminate collision stress and strain variables, as well as some other factors that might in- dividually or collectively account for this phenomenon, thereby allowing positive identification of a factor that had been suspect for many years. By these examples, then, it has been shown that 13 years of full scale collision research at UCLA has been greatly assisted, at times, by parallel stud- ies using simulation techniques. It would be naive to suggest that there are not shortcom- ings associated with simulation techniques. Oversimplifica- tion will lead to erroneous conclusions and, clearly, there is no even tradeoff for accepting any misinformation in the interest of expediency during the quest for valid informa- tion. It often takes years to stamp out concepts based on misinformation. Consequently, the basic advantage which a simulator provides -- that of the capacity for isolating a variable for intensive study -- may likewise be the basis for erroneous conclusions, where the behavior of that vari- able is quite different when operating under a multivariant condition. Where such complexities are implied, validation studies involving full scale research will guard against mis- interpretations. Mr. Cichowski clearly recognizes the need of this pre- caution in his summary statement, "It should be emphasized that the impact sled is intended to supplement our overall crash testing program; it will not replace many forms of full- scale vehicle impact or roll-over tests." The author has illustrated the usefulness of this crash sim- ulator by examples of experiments that have been conducted to date. I was deeply impressed with the door latch com- ponent studies under crash simulation conditions and with the dynamic tests on seat belt installations. The GMG simulator study that impresses me most con- cerns rear end impacts. This simulator is an extremely use- ful tool for evaluating motorist seat back performance dur- ing rear-end collisions. Engineers have known for years that low seat backs promote injury for the rear-ended motorists However, stylists following the dictates of what they believe to be public preference, allowed subsequent designs to in- clude reduced back support. With this simulator, the engi- neer is able to show, in a very realistic and convincing man- ner, what happens to the motorist when he is struck in the rear by another automobile. Without a head support, in- ertial forces from the unsupported head and shoulders act abusively, along the entire spinal column. With respect to the steering wheel tests described in this paper -- within this crash simulator are subcomponent sim- ulations constraining the anthropometric dummy to kine- matic behavior corresponding to actual barrier impact tests. The hazard of this double simulation is readily apparent, but may be controlled against by a repeat experiment, in which the constraints supplied to the dummy are removed to allow the more natural destructive interaction with the car steering wheel and interior surfaces. Although probably anticipated by General Motors re- searchers, this same precaution applies to their windshield studies involving a dummy whose movements also are con- trolled. The General Motors windshield impact studies will greatly contribute to tfte development of safer glazing tor the auto- mobile. The simulator will also be useful for evaluating windshields that have been in use at least five years and to study the degradation of windshield safety glass as a func- tion of time and useage. Five years is approximately the average age of automobiles on the road today, and is, there- fore, a useful age tor sampling vehicle safety performance characteristics being utilized by the average motorist. Without question, the General Motors crash simulator is the finest device of its kind in the world today. The studies which it is capable of undertaking, and the data that it can generate, documents it as a powerful research tool. I am sure that members of the Society of Automotive Engineers join me in looking forward to the many excellent and com- prehensive studies, concerning motorist safety, that will be forthcoming from experiments conducted on this unique de- vice. L. M. Patrick Wayne State University BEFORE GETTING INTO the technical aspects of the impact machine presented in Mr. Cichowski 's paper, I would like to comment on the attitude of the automotive companies to- ward passenger safety. Recent close association with repre- sentatives of the automotive companies on several SAE com- mittees on safety has shown increased emphasis being placed on safety, which will undoubtedly result in a reduction of injuries and fatalities in automotive accidents. The device described in the paper by Mr. Cichowski will provide a source of information that has not been available in the past. Full scale automobile crashes are so expensive that only a limited number of tests can be made annually , while the vast areas to be investigated warrant unlimited testing. Furthermore, even with the most carefully con- trolled full scale test, it is not possible to reproduce the impact exactly from test to test. A dilemma results wherein variations arising from the type of testing require a statis- tical evaluation, while the expense of such tests prohibits statistical methods. W ith this new device , it will be possible to reproduce exact test conditions at a comparatively low cost. Thus, enough tests can be made to provide the data for a statis-</page><page sequence="11">PASSENGER CAR SAFETY STUDIES 373 tical analysis and also the reproducibility will assure more meaningful tests. In particular, the versatility of this piece of equipment will permit the comparison of prototype com- ponents with an accuracy heretofore impossible. For ex- ample, the injurious effect of various designs of instrument panels can be compared quickly and relatively inexpen- sively, while the accuracy of the results will be greater than those obtained on full scale car tests. The several areas of investigation covered during the brief time the device has been in operation testify to the conven- ience and speed with which evaluations can be made. It is interesting to note the method in which the simu- lated crash is obtained. The relative acceleration between the passenger and the vehicle is the important parameter in a crash, and this is obtained with a positive acceleration, in this instance, instead of the negative acceleration found in automobile crashes. There are many other examples of the principle of relative motion in use, such as a wind tun- nel. In barrier impacts, the vehicle is usually stopped before the passenger hits the structural members. Consequently, the shape of the acceleration pulse is not important. How- ever, when seat belts are being investigated, or when con- sidering a car to car or other impact where the accelera- tions are not so radical, the shape of the acceleration pulse is important in the results obtained. This simulator permits the acceleration pulse to be controlled to duplicate that measured in an actual crash situation; therefore, its useful- ness is not limited to barrier type impacts. Crashes, such as car -to -car, in which the accelerations are not as severe as those obtained in barrier impacts, are more difficult to duplicate since the control problem is more complicated. Duplication of measured results on the crash simulator will be comparatively easy and accurate, permit- ting the functionality and durability of mechanical equip- ment to be verified under various crash conditions, and to be improved prior to production where found inadequate. Also , the safety aspects of the passenger compartment under these crashes can be considered conveniently for the first time. Simulated crashes are limited to those with a maximum acceleration of 40 g 's, with the stroke available in the power piston. This encompasses the usual survival range of crashes of a rather severe nature. It is particularly well adapted for studies of crashes into solid barriers such as bridge abutments or large trees. Car -to -car crashes, or crashes in which the car rebounds from a guard rail or curb and con- tinues on for a considerable distance, cannot be duplicated in this device. These are generally of a less severe nature, unless the final stop is against a rigid body such as a tree, utility pole , or the like . Instrumentation In any type of impact test it is essential that all data be recorded, since the entire crash takes place in a matter of milliseconds. The instrumentation used with this device is adequate but limited in the manner in which it can be uti- lized . Previous experience with measurements of impacts has resulted in the decision to go to instrumentation tape recorders wherever possible. Particular advantages accruing from a tape recording are: 1. The time base can be extended so that the short dur- ation impacts can be spread out to a point where the wave shape or record shape can be analyzed. 2. The entire record takes place in a few milliseconds and the records are likely to overlap when they are recorded simultaneously on the paper recorder. The tape recorder permits a rerun of records that are overlapped with the rec- ords displaced to avoid errors in reading records that have fallen on top of one another. This means of recording data as outlined in the paper are adequate, and will get good re- sults providing there is no obliteration of the data due to overlapping . If the data are to be analyzed on a computer, the tape recording is particularly desirable. Use of Dummies on Tests Anthropomorphic dummies have been developed for use in crash tests with special emphasis placed on the mass dis- tribution of the dummy to correspond to the head of the hu- man. However, it has never been possible to duplicate the complex human structure with any degree of accuracy. Therefore, use of cadavers for at least the preliminary tests, or preferably as a means of calibrating the dummies, is rec- ommended. This brings up the problem of obtaining the cadavers, which is insurmountable in most cases. The only way they are available for these tests is. through cooperation with medical schools , where the results can be used for stu- dent training and /or research projects to advance the knowl- edge in the field. As a rough approximation of the variations that can be encountered when using anthropomorphic dummies instead of cadavers, an analysis of Fig. 24 is in order. The inte- grated velocity from the acceleration time record is ap- proximately 19 mph. The approximate acceleration im- pulse time is 22 msec and the mean acceleration is approxi- mately 40 g 's. For a similar impact into glass with a ca- daver with a crystal accelerometer mounted on the head, the measured acceleration is approximately 100-110 g 's with a time duration in the order of 6-8 msec. In the area of biomechanics, this device brings to mind many investigations on injury and potential injury that have yet to be investigated, and could be investigated to good advantage on it. In particular, crash injuries can be studied from the standpoint of skull fracture and concussion; lacer- ation studies from cuts from glass or sharp interior structures; internal injuries from impact to the steering wheel or im- properly designed seat belts; chest impacts to steering wheel and means of minimizing the injury from steering wheel impacts; knee injuries from impact to the instrument panel or other parts of the car interior; hip injuries from forces transmitted through the knees to the hip, causing fracture</page><page sequence="12">374 W. G. CICHOWSKI of the femoral neck; and other fractures caused by impact with various parts of the car including fracture of the arms, lower limbs, spine, and other bones. One method of investigating the injuries mentioned in the preceding paragraph is to start with tests on volunteers in which they are subjected to increasing levels of impact until the voluntary tolerance limit is reached. At that time the test on the volunteer is stopped and continued with tests on either anthropomorphic dummies, cadavers, or living ani- mals. The effectiveness of the anthropomorphic dummies or the cadavers can be checked by starting the tests with the same range used on the volunteers. If exact correlation is not obtained on the dummies, as on volunteers, then a correlating factor can be determined. Thereafter, the test is continued at higher and higher impact levels, until the point is reached where serious damage occurs, as evidenced by skeletal damage or conditions known to be injurious from clinical observations. Summary In conclusion, General Motors is to be congratulated on this excellent piece of test equipment, which will permit full scale tests to be conducted at a lower cost so more tests can be run. Furthermore, the tests will be conducted under controlled conditions which can be repeated, insuring more valuable data. The method of applying the load in the reverse direc- tion is apparently just as satisfactory as doing it in the normal manner where the velocity is decreased rather thąn increased. R. J.
