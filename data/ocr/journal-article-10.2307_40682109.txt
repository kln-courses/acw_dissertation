<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. B. S. and Bunyan's Badman Scott McMillini The Burgunder Collection of Shaw in the Cornell University Library includes a copy of Bunyan's Life and Death of Mr. Badman with copious annotations in Shaw's hand. My main purpose is to present a complete transcript of the annotations, which should bear usefully upon recent discussions of Shaw's attitude toward Bunyan; but first the date and motive of the inscriptions require a few words of intro- duction and a hint of caution.2 Shaw owned the edition of Mr. Badman published by William Heinmann in 1900 and splendidly illustrated by the brothers Louis and George W. Rhead. He probably purchased the book in 1903 (the date is written, apparently in Shaw's hand, on the inside front cover), and it remained in his library until the sale at Sotheby's in July, 1949. The annotations are in the hand of the older Shaw, and a fairly pre- cise date can be inferred from a passage in Blanche Patch's Thirty Years with G.B.S. (London, 1951). In describing the rush of events just before the Sotheby sale, Miss Patch writes that "G.B.S. made one or two half-hearted efforts to exploit the Shaw name, offering to in- scribe a number of the books" (p. 28). The Sotheby catalogue for the sale (25 July 1949) correspondingly refers to five annotated vol- umes, and Mr. Badman is one of them. It would seem, then, that Shaw wrote the annotations in 1949, shortly before the July sale, and with an eye toward increased profits.3 To find a profit motive in Shaw will surprise no one. But Miss Patch implies a warning which we must take into account. If the an- notations were truly "half -hearted - that is mere trumpery for the sake of the sale - they would deserve little more than a curious glance. No doubt, some of the notes are trivial (#5, #22), some rather miss the point of the text (#14, #30), and one (#38, on "selling in the dearest market"), has to be read with irony, no matter in what spirit it was written. But the length of the inscriptions - over 2200 words 1 Mr. McMillin is Assistant Professor of English at Cornell University. 8 Permission to publish has been granted by the Public Trustee and The Society of Authors on behalf of the Shaw Estate. I am also indebted to Mr. Bernard F. Burgunder of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and to Mr. Harry Mushlin of London for information about the date and circumstances of the annotations. Four brief lines of shorthand jottings, which appear on the blank leaf opposite #43, have remained undecipherable, despite the kind efforts of several colleagues. 8 Notes #2 through #28 are in a darker shade of ink than the others, perhaps indicating that the inscriptions were written at different times. But Shaw himself implies a single writing (#2), and 1949 remains the most likely date. 90</page><page sequence="2">in 42 entries - suggests something more than diffidence, and the longer annotations are written with zest. Toward the end of the volume the annotations gain in relevance to Bunyan, so that among fewer signs than before of anecdote and whimsy the final inscriptions point toward a serious evaluation of Bunyan's work. The long "post- script," despite some questionable reasoning and a factual mistake, re- mains Shaw's most explicit account of Bunyan's career. I do not think that Shaw could remain half-hearted for long about his writing, even in old age; and these annotations suggest that he warmed to a serious criticism of Bunyan as he proceeded. As to Shaw's opinion of Bunyan, the annotations will help to clarify a blurred subject. The generalization that Shaw's "favorite author is Bunyan" has been heard often since Chesterton first an- nounced it in 19104. Recently, however, Norbert F. O'Donnell and E. E. Stokes, Jr., looking carefully at Shaw's published comments on Bunyan, have implied reasons for qualifying Chesterton's statement.5 There seems to be no evidence that Shaw read Grace Abounding, for example, and although he did know The Holy War, he dismissed it as "hardly readable." Of the lesser theological writings Shaw seems to have shared the ignorance of the twentieth century. Mr. Badman pre- sents a more complicated case. There can be no doubt that one part of the book always appealed to Shaw. The section on Mr. Badman's financial treachery in a capitalist world often gained his praise. He lectured about it in the early 1900's, alluded to it in revising The Quintessence of Ibsenism, returned to it in Everybody's Political What's What?, and added his final comments in #34 and #38 below.6 But to praise Mr. Badman as a "first-rate economic document" is hardly to catch the full intention of the work. Mr. Badman is primar- ily a documented lecture on Salvationist theology, devoted to a strin- gent examination of human depravity, and unlike Pilgrims Progress it runs counter to Shaw's own ethical views. This disagreement be- tween Shaw's attitude and Bunyan's becomes clear in the annotations. To put it bluntly, Bunyan "was a dangerous man when he was wrong or ignorant or both." That is an overstatement, but a milder patter of disapproval for Bunyan's theological rigidity runs throughout these annotations, giving no indication that Mr. Badman, aside from the * George Bernard Shaw (London, 1910), p. 47. 8 Norbert F.

If Shaw's favorite author was Bunyan, I suspect that this admira- tion derived from Pilgrim's Progress alone. That was a marvelous book to G.B.S. It made a deep impression on him at an early age, an impression which lasted throughout his life and which prompted the splendid sections on Bunyan in the "Epistle Dedicatory" to Man and Superman. But these annotations to Mr. Badman, along with Shaw's silence about Grace Abounding and his dismissal of The Holy War, suggest that his knowledge of Bunyan's secondary works was some- times casual, and his admiration often slight. The transcript that follows is an exact copy, and I have signalled only the most obvious grammatical lapses. The Bunyan passages are in italics, and except where "Attentive" is noted in brackets, they are voiced by Mr. Wiseman (or by Bunyan himself, in the preface and titles). Underlining in all cases is Shaw's. Along with page references to the Heinemann edition I have included references to the more read- ily available World's Classics edition (Oxford, 1929). 1. Blank first leaf -NOTE ON THE ART OF THIS BOOK- This edition of Badman was not undertaken and published as a treatise on Nonconformist theology. It is too big for a brevi- ary, and was evidently meant to be treasured as a masterpiece of the art of its printers and illustrators. As such, it dares challenge comparison with the famous co-operation of William Morris and Burne- Jones called the Kelmscott Press which raised book manu- facture to summit level among the fine arts at the end of the nineteenth century. In that comparison it was clean out of fashion: so different from the Kelmscott Chaucer, so defiant of its technical rules, that the fact that the two books are contemporary will probably seem incredible a century hence. As well describe El Greco as a con- temporary of Frith. Burne-Jones illustrating Badman is as incon- ceivable as Morris writing him. Had anyone submitted these pages to Morris as models for artistic type designing and setting he would have kicked them across the room with a torrent of im- precations, not because his artistic judgment, which was within human limits infallible, would have failed him, but because the pages are so good in a kind that he abhorred and was out to destroy. He hated "mutton quads" between the sentences, as they 92</page><page sequence="4">made trickles of white down the solid black of the rectangle of letterpress; and here there are quads not only between the sen- tences but between the words. The top and bottom margins are equal, and the inner ones very wide: a feature contrary to that of the twelfth century scribes and Morris. Morris held that different types should never appear on the same page. Look at the title page of this book. Every fount in the printer's entire plant is crammed into it. All the same, these heresies were the common decencies and orthodoxies of commercial printing in Morris's day. The brothers Rhead succeeded in depicting Mr Badman exactly as Bunyan imagined him; and the pictures are superbly engraved. The print- ing is entirely congruous, and the treatment of Bunyan's character- istic shoulder notes and of the title page ornamental and effective. Unfashionable as the book was when I bought it, I am satis- fied that is was a sound investment as a work of art. GBS 2. Half-title - Bunyan's Third Best Parable - My Copy G. Bernard Shaw What led me to scribble all over this book was not my regard for Bunyan as a great literary artist trained by reading the Jacob- ean translation of the Bible, as I myself was trained by reading the Bible and Bunyan. It is the patent fact that John was so en- tirely well-intentioned in wielding his trenchant literary weapon that he was a dangerous man when he was wrong or ignorant or both. I was provoked first to marginal interruptions and warnings, but finally to a criticism at the end. Q.V. [Shaw's Bookplate] 3. p. 3 (Oxford, p. 7) . . . the just and revenging hand of God.

When we moved to a place out of reach of a church I was greatly relieved. When my father gave up reading family prayers I never missed them: they supplied no spiritual need of mine.

O, thou beast, how much art thou worse than the horse that thou ridest on! Nobody could afford to give a horse alcohol. My grandfather had a dog which drank whisky greedily. To make it drunk was considered a good joke. 31. p. 50 (Oxford, p. 91) . . .1 suppose they [the stories in Clark's Looking-glass for Sinners] are as true as notable. The infantile credulity of this from a man of John's mental calibre is astonishing; but in my youth a common form of asseveration was "Lord strike me dead if I am not speaking the truth". See Dickens's Great Expectations. 32. p. 51 (Oxford, p. 92) For God by this, and such judgments, says thus to such an one: 'Thou wicked one, thou lovest not me, my ways, nor my people; 97</page><page sequence="9">thou castest my law and good counsel behind thy back: Come, I will dispose of thee in my wrath. . . .

In the XIX century some of the largest businesses in London were built on two or three bankruptcies. Bunyan here knows what he is writing about. 35. p. 83 (Oxford, p. 154) And let [the bankrupt's creditors] forgive him, or . . . take that which he hath for satisfaction: or . . .lay his body under affliction, this way or that, according to law. . . . They could legally do both, and often did. Bunyan did not know as much about this as Dickens learnt when his father was a pris- oner for dead [debt] in the Fleet and the Marshalsea. Bunyan makes no protest against the horror of the practice. It was abol- ished within my recollection. But the King can still "take the body in execution" and imprison his debtor for life. 36. p. 86 (Oxford, p. 161) [Referring to brevity.] I profess myself not an artist that way. . . . Might have been written by Ruskin or Richard Wagner. 37. p. 97 (Oxford, p. 182) A man in dealing should as really design his neighbours good, profit, and advantage, as his own. . . . Golden rule. 38. p. 98 (Oxford, pp. 183-185) [Describes mercantile profiteering.] This long and elaborate demonstration of the wickedness of buy- ing in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest shews no prevision of the doctrine preached by Cobden and Bastiat after its establishment as orthodox by Adam Smith, that the way to ensure universal prosperity and peace is for everyone to buy for as little and sell for as much as possible, and then - Laissez-faire. 98</page><page sequence="10">Yet this was and is founded on Bunyan's own faith, shared by Adam Smith, in a continual guidance, government, and inter- ference of God, whose omnipotence must overrule for good all the operations and vagaries of human selfishness. Shakespear had al- ready written that "There's a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will". This assumption reigned unchallenged until Carlyle came back to Bunyan by denouncing Free Trade as Godforsaken non- sense. Certainly when it is Godforsaken, as it largely is at present, it is nonsense; but when it has the faith of Bunyan, Adam Smith, and Voltaire at its back, there is a good deal to be said for it. 39. p. 127 (Oxford, p. 234) Who would keep a cow of their own, that can have a quart of milk for a penny? Erewhon Butler's favorite proverb. 40. p. 136 (Oxford, p. 255) . . . Mr. Badman was naught, his life was evil, his ways were evil, evil to his end: He therefore went to hell and to the devil, how quietly soever he died. This long and labored series of "proofs" that Badman went to hell is not only obsolete nonsense for those who can no longer believe in eternal brimstone (as to Bunyan's insistance on which see my postscript) but differs fundamentally from the treatment of the same theme in The Pilgrim's Progress, where the one person who from the very threshold of heaven is carried away by angels and flung into the burning pit is Ignorance, to whom no vices are ascribed. It is the Athanasian that damns him, not any fault of his own. 41. p. 140 (Oxford, p. 266) This was a sign of God's anger; he had a mind to damn him for his sins. ... ! ! ! ! 42. p. 141 (Oxford, pp. 266-267) "He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart " This is very like Udall's "The schoolmaster's delight is to flog". 43. Blank final leaf [See footnote 2]. 99</page><page sequence="11">-POSTSCRIPT- Lord Acton noted that men are corrupted by power. Some are ruined by it. It is a common party trick to flatter successful rival leaders on the chance of their developing swelled head and making themselves ridiculous and contemptible by pompous airs. But this is not corruption: it is failure under test, and rids us of ambitious weaklings. What Lord Acton meant is the development of strongheaded competent rulers from demagogues into despots and tyrants. Squire Cromwell M.P. a Dissenter, makes himself autocratic Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with succession for his son. Lieutenant Bonepart of the upstart army of the Revolution makes himself Holy Roman Emperor and im- prisons the Pope. Schickelgruber, beer cellar chairman and house- painter, makes himself Almighty Realm Chancellor of Germany for life. Schoolmaster Mussolini becomes Duke and Viceroy, Subaltern Franco Supreme Gauleiter, Nobody Kemal, Pasha and virtually Caliph and Ottoman Sultan &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;.7 Historians ascribe these self -promotions to ambition founded on the common delusion that supreme political power is the most desirable of human enjoyments and a crown the most comfortable headgear. Plato knew better: he taught that only the reluctant were wise enough to govern. Lord Acton should have urged that not only power but popularity and responsibility force rulers to deviate from Bunyan's straight and narrow path as they forced Bunyan himself. Practical experience of legislation and adminis- tration soon convince liberty mongers that it is the straight and narrow path that leads to the City of Destruction, and the broad one, with alluring mirages at every mile, that leads to order and civilization. For the moment forget Napoleon and Peter the Great (alias Peter the Blackguard). Turn to Jesus and Mahomet. It is their cases which explain the change from the world-poet who wrote The Pilgrim's Progress to the sectarian historian of The Holy War, and finally to the doctrinaire biographer of Mr Badman.8 Born to bear witness to the truth Bunyan found, as Jesus and Mahomet found, that common humanity cannot bear enough truth to be governed by it. Common men and women will not obey until they are threatened with an eternity of hell. They will not revere prophets who cannot perform miracles to 7 This paragraph is largely a repetition of Everybody's Polüical Whafs What?, pp. 339-40. 8 The correct order of publication: Pilgrim's Progress, 1678; Mr. ttadman, loot); ine Holy War, 1682. 100</page><page sequence="12">prove that they are divinely inspired. They will not worship any creative force that is not omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, infallible, and yet anthropomorphic. They will not face death on any terms: they must be guaranteed immortal even in hell: to please them doctrine must be what we now call Escapist. Being sinful they must have a Saviour and Redeemer who will absolve them and return some day to establish a kingdom of heaven on earth for them to be boundlessly happy in for ever. Voltaire the philosopher and philanthropist, said that were there no God, it would be necessary to invent one; and Robespierre, the ruler, testified from experience that Voltaire was right. Neither of them realized how many inventions were even more necessary. Only by pretending to believe in all the necessary inventions can kings and captains, popes and prelates, pastors and apostles, rule their legions and their flocks. Bunyan abhorred Mr Badman; but when he became a popular preacher, and had to keep Badman in order to make a Goodman of him, he had not only to enlighten him but to humbug him: for on no other condition could he be effectively "saved"; for it is hard to believe that men of the high intelligence and deep insight of Jesus, Mahomet, and Bunyan could be taken in by the tales told by Mr Attentive to Mr Wise- man in this book. They had to turn them to account as revelations, or be slain as Jerusalem slew its prophets or Calvin slew Giordano Bruno. As it was, Jesus was executed for rioting and rebellion; Bun- yan was for years a jailbird for differing from Archbishop Laud; and innumerable Friends ("Quakers"), male and female, were mutilated, pilloried, and flogged for blowing the gaff on one or other of the lies and legends by which simple souls are cheated into salvation. I blame neither Napoleon for making himself Emperor nor Bunyan for disguising his Pilgrim Christian in the clothes of Mr. Wiseman ci devant Worldly Wiseman. You, dear reader, may find the masquerade as helpful as Mr. Attentive did. GBS 101</page></plain_text>
