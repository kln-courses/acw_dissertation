Glutamate was detected using the 146/41 (M) and 147/42 (M + 1) independent samples and the paired Student t test for paired samples. All fragments. The daughter ion Q3 = 41 corresponds to glutamate [4- 13C] data are expressed as means ± SE in the text. and [5-13C] (originated from acetyl-CoA). Therefore, 147/42 corresponds to [4-13C] glutamate. Glutamate APE was calculated by the ratio of 147/42 P ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank Yanna Kosover, Irina Smolgovsky, Mikhail over (147/42, 146/41). Glutamate natural abundance was calculated from bi- Smolgovsky, Zhen-Xiang Liu, Gina Solomon, RN, and the staff of the Yale– opsy tissues infused with natural abundance glucose and subtracted from the New Haven Hospital Research Unit for expert technical assistance with the enriched samples. The relative VPDH /VCS was calculated according to the follow- studies and the volunteers for participating in this study. This work was ing formula derived previously (10): V /V = [4-13C] glutamate/[3-13C] alanine. supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 AG-23686, R01 DK-PDH CS 49230, R01 NS-087568, R24 DK-085638, P30 DK-45735, R01 DK-092606, and M01 RR-00125; the Novo-Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Re- Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView soft- search; Novartis Pharmaceuticals (K.F.P.); and a Distinguished Clinical Scien- ware (Abacus Concepts). Statistically significant differences between young tist award (to K.F.P.) and a Mentor award (to G.I.S.) from the American control and elderly subjects were detected using unpaired Student t tests for Diabetes Association. 1.
