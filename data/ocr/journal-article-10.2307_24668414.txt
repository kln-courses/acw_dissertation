ISBN 90 04 10455 0. When, at the turn of the century, Wilhelm Bousset wrote his Der Antichrist in der Überlieferung des Judentums, des Neuen Testament und der alten Kirche (1895, Eng. tr. 1896), it was fashionable to describe religious phenomena in the broad est possible terms and with the broadest possible historical sweeps. For Bousset, as for Frazer, Müller, and Eliade, the task of understanding a myth or prac tice was no less than a foray into the evolution of human civilization, with implications for the nature of religion itself, and to this enterprise was brought a formidable knowledge of religious literature. But this kind of scholarship had a novelistic quality as well: to write the history and character of a myth inevitably involved giving it a kind of narrative integrity that went beyond any particular cultural expression. Today we have lost the breathless historical sweeps and literary artistry that these scholars brought to their ethnographic materials. But as the History of Religions has multiplied with specialties and scopes, and the old categories of "dying/rising god," "solar religion," and "mystery cult" are dismantled or abandoned, we are offered the ever-increasing possibility of precision in the study of religious traditions. The historiography on the idea of the Antichrist is no exception: from Bousset, through R.H. Charles's Revelation commentary (1920) and Gregory Jenks's Origins and Early Development of the Antichrist Myth (1991), to L.J. Lietaert Peerbolte's Antecedents of Antichrist, we see the fragmen tation of a gloriously monolithic "Antichrist myth" (which Bousset traced to ancient Near Eastern chaos monsters) into diverse and discrete literary evo cations of eschatological adversity. From the beginning, Antichrist studies had to balance the appearance (or scholarly presumption) of a uniform "myth" with the striking incoherence of literature on eschatological adversaries in early Judaism and Christianity; and it is the "myth" that has finally lost in L.P.'s invaluable study. Let us consider briefly the nature of the evidence. Several texts collected in the New Testament refer, with a combination of certainty and anxiety, to eschatological adversaries human, super-human, and spiritual: 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 John, the Book of Revelation, and perhaps the Gospel of Mark's chapter 13. 1 and 2 John alone designate this figure as antichristos. Christian texts of the second century pursue the activities of an anthropomorphic, ulti mate adversary to the Christian community even further; and by the third century such a figure has gained a fixed place in the end-time scenario, pro viding a rich topic for Christian speculation up to contemporary times (see Bernard McGinn's Antichrist: Two Thousand Years of the Human Fascination with Evil [San Francisco 1994]). © Koninklijke Brill, Leiden, 1997 Journal for the Study of Judaism, XXVIII, 3</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW OF BOOKS 339 Early Jewish texts (particularly those of an apocalyptic bent) also have the occasional reflection on eschatological adversity. In fact, as L.P. and others have shown, the Book of Daniel, with its images of eschatological tyrants in chapters 7-8 and 11, was often used as a proof-text for outlining the acts of the Antichrist. Others describe the general woes of the eschaton or the diverse personifications of evil that would arise in the end-times. However, since scholarship has hitherto looked at the Jewish texts (and the first-century Christian texts) from the vantage of a developed "antichrist tradition" that developed in the patristic period, it is no surprise that these earlier materials and their various affiliations have been commonly cast as mere preparatory stages and prototypes for the Christian idea. Governed by such a teleological scheme, Jewish and early Christian materials could not but reflect a single myth in the process of assembly, much as Christianity itself used to be viewed as the culmination of various Jewish trends. It is to L.P.'s credit to have removed the teleological scheme altogether, to examine not "the development of the antichrist myth" but rather the ante cedents to the late antique Christian image of eschatological adversary as the texts themselves present them. The book (a slighdy revised dissertation) tends therefore to be ploddingly microscopic and literary, but it is certainly the best and most responsible study yet produced of the materials—and of the whole notion of eschatological adversaries in early Judaism and Christianity. L.P. tackles this subject by examining, first, the earliest Christian mate rials, chapter by chapter, and then those Jewish materials that have often been claimed to represent Antichrist prototypes. With the Christian materials L.P. provides occasional glimpses of verifiable literary developments. Thus, in a chapter (ch. 2) on the images of eschatological deception in the Gospel of Mark ("false christs and false prophets will appear," 13:22), which are clearly distinct from anything like a single anthropomorphic adversary, L.P. also ad dresses the subsequent development of this passage in the Apocalypse of Peter, which outlines the deeds of a singular "Lawless One." So also chapters on 2 Thessalonians (ch. 3), 1 and 2 John (ch. 4), and Revelation (ch. 5) include discussions of uses of these texts (or their specific ideas) in Justin (2 Thess) and Polycarp (1, 2 John). In order to illustrate the still idiosyncratic portraits of eschatological adversity in second-century texts, L.P. then proceeds to the Didache (ch. 6), Barnabas (ch. 7), and the Ascension of Isaiah (ch. 8). L.P. approaches texts with a critically-attuned and non-confessional per spective that certainly contributes to the book's value. In most cases, he finds, authors are referring to eschatological ideas and terms known in their own communities but not evidendy beyond them. Sometimes the "adversary" is spiritual (1,2 Jn), sometimes anthropomorphic (2 Thess, Asc. Is.), sometimes mythical—a template to place upon contemporary events (Rev). In many cases the conceptualization of adversity stems from an interpretation of the Book of Daniel, which developed the idea of eschatological, impious tyranny out of</page><page sequence="3">340 REVIEW OF BOOKS historical experiences with Antiochus IV Epiphanes. But when L.P. scans the texts for their distinctive images of eschatoiogical adversity he finds, far more often than a single horrific tyrant that might presage the late antique Antichrist, instead a focus on false prophets. When L.P. reviews the texts in historical progression (ch. 9) he observes, not the conglomeration of a monolithic "myth," but rather a shift in the loca tion of eschatoiogical adversaries: from the present moment (whose internecine rivalries "must" reflect eschatoiogical combat), to the near future (as an obstruc tion or prelude to Christ's return), to the eventual future (as a stock element in the Christian eschatoiogical tableau). The second part of the book reviews some "contemporary Jewish views on eschatoiogical opponents," again with an eye toward diversity rather than uniform myths. Daniel, the oft-cited biblical source for Antichrist speculations of the patristic period, provides an image of an eschatoiogical tyrant opposed to God (ch. 10). But where Jenks had sought multiple parallels to this same figure in Jewish literature in order to ground his theory of a wide-spread "Endtyrant" myth, L.P. finds quite different eschatoiogical scenarios out there. Jubilees portrays a much more general cosmic decline that includes rising antag onism to the righteous (ch. 11). Eschatoiogical tableaux in 1 Enoch imagine grow ing dishaimony and monstrous personifications of chaos (ch. 12). 4 Ezra (ch. 15) and 2 Baruch (ch. 16) offer both images of eschatoiogical chaos and frightening tyrants. Yet these tyrants appear quite differently: in 4 Ezra (5:6; 11:29-35) a reuse of Daniel, in 2 Baruch (36, 40) a personification of evil. 2 Baruch's tyrant might resemble later Christian images of Antichrist, but context dictates that we read this figure as a component of 2 Baruch's unique eschatoiogical tableau. So also the tyrannical evil figures in the Assumption of Moses (ch. 14) and the Third Sibylline Oracle (ch. 17) are discussed not as milestones toward the Christian Antichrist but rather as idiosyncratic to their authors' theological or political schemes. The third Sibylline Oracle's image of the figure Beliar, for example, differs from the Qumran sectarians' figure of the same name in being essentially a demonization of Nero redivivus (a widespread theme of the late first and sec ond centuries C.E.). L.P.'s discussion of the images of eschatoiogical adversity in the Qumran texts (ch. 13) is particularly useful for its currency with newer materials: not only the War Scroll, the Rule Scroll, the Damascus document, and other well known texts, but also 1 lQ_Melchizedek, 4QAmram, and the enigmatic "son of God" text (4Q246) provide a range of personifications of evil. Qumran's concentration of adversaries seems to suggest a community deeply concerned with the relationship of false leadership to eschatology: Belial, Melchiresha, a "false prophet" in the Habakkuk pesher, and a figure who "will be called son of God" in the end-times (4Q246). The sectarians' image of Belial, the prin cipal supernatural opponent to God, whose hostility would culminate in the last days, seems to have continued into the Christian Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. L.P. discusses the continuities without mitigating the essential Chris tian character of the Testaments.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW OF BOOKS 341 L.P.'s conclusion to this survey of Jewish materials clearly militates against a unilinear development of the Antichrist idea out of Jewish tradition. Where the earliest Christian texts stress, alongside the general increase of adversity in the end-times, a profusion of false prophets as the critical opposition to be met by the righteous, the Jewish texts deemphasize false prophets and point instead to larger opponents, ultimate tyrants and the onslaught of Gentile nations, threats to Israel as a whole. Raising the fear of false prophets to prominence in the earliest Christian imaginations is an important corrective to most "antichrist scholarship" since Bousset, which tended to see the tradi tion oscillating simply between sea monsters and genuine historical tyrants. The legacy of the false prophet image (Deut 13) seems, for example, to have motivated the portrayal of rival thaumaturges in Luke-Acts (see Garrett, The Demise of the Devil [Minneapolis 1989]). But what are we to make of the dis tanced adversaries of the Jewish eschatologies (apart from Qumran)? Was the "intimate enemy" in fact a comparatively minimal obstacle to salvation in the view of most apocalyptic writers (pace Elaine Pagels, The Origin of Satan [New York 1995], ch. 2)? Such conclusions can work only as well as one's sample; and L.P. has done the best one could expect in expanding the data beyond the Christian canon. But the implications of L.P.'s comparison reach well beyond the escha tological motifs. The peculiar early Christian concern with false prophets reflects an overwhelming concern not with broad political events but with the micro politics and rivalries of sectarian religion, in which the identification of sacred authority in the spheres of prophecy, teaching, leadership, and interpretation, poses the most critical problems for community stability. In the case of 1/2 John, L.P. shows well the relationship between schism and rival leadership on the one hand and the conceptualization of eschatological adversaries on the other; he might have pushed 2 Thessalonians, Revelation, and indeed 2 Corinthians (11:13-15, never discussed) in the same direction, all composi tions that reflect crises over authority within a new apocalyptic sect—indeed, the uncertainty and ambiguity that inevitably besets all charismatic leadership and its evaluation. By the same token, the rich imagery of eschatological adver saries in the Qumran texts cannot but reflect their sectarian milieu and the various schisms and leadership crises that the sect endured before its destruc tion. The Habakkuk ptsher, indeed, identifies Belial as the Satanic inspiration behind the sect's opponents (lQpHab X, 9). And one Christian apocalyptic tract from the third century that L.P. does not bring in for understandable reasons, the Apocalypse of Elijah, launches into its extensive discourse on the "Lawless One" right after warning about false leaders of the end-time. For the author of this tract, the advent of false leadership implied the imminence of much more insidious and supernatural adversity (see my Elijah in Upper Egypt [Minneapolis 1993], ch. 5). One might have hoped that L.P. himself could have drawn together these implications, to move from the dissertation in biblical literature to the syn thetic, social-scientific appraisal of eschatological adversaries in the nascent</page><page sequence="5">342 REVIEW OF BOOKS Christian movement. But by itself The Antecedents of Antichrist is an exemplary study, a rich foundation for future work on eschatological traditions in early Judaism and Christianity and a great step forward in the critical history of "Antichrist" as a concept. "History, rightly done, must err on the side of radi cal nominalism," Jacob Neusner once wrote; and L.P. has succeeded in frag menting a timeless "myth" into numerous discrete images, to be compared only with the greatest care.
