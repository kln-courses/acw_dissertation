Sulaymàn and Anthropomorphism1* Muiťim Sirry Divinity School, University of Chicago, USA When writing about Muqâtil b. Sulaymân (d. 150/767) in The Encyclopaedia of Islam, M. Plessner describes quite confidently that "the sources are unan- imous in talking of his extreme anthropomorphism ( tashblh )."2 Muslim biographers in general agree that Muqâtil ascribes to an extreme view of God's attributes to the extent that God is conceived of as having flesh and blood. Several biographers mention the report that his extreme view of God's attributes had also reached the caliph (perhaps, al-Mansūr), and he asked Muqâtil: "I heard that you are likening (God with human's attri- butes)." Muqâtil answered: "I am only saying: lSay : God is one . God is the eternal ' (Q.112). Whoever said other than that has lied."3 This report is sig- nificant for two unrelated reasons. First, Muqâtil seems to have a close rela- tionship with the ruler, which may contribute to his bad reputation in the eyes of pious Muslims. Second, he denied the accusation of being an extreme anthropomorphist. The truth of this denial must be evaluated through a close reading of his own writings, rather than relying on others' (mainly, his opponents') characterization. l* I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my mentor, ustādh Michael Sells, without whose critical comments and guidance this study would not have been possible. I am indebted to two dearest friends Dadi Darmadi and Sukidi Mulyadi for their encouragement and kind supports during the process of writ- ing this article. They can, of course, in no way be held responsible for any ideas expressed in this article. 2 M. Plessner, "Mukatil b. Sulaiman," The Encyclopaedia of Islam , eds. M.Th.

Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 39 The purpose of this article is to examine whether the usual accusations of anthropomorphism against the early Quťánic commentator Muqâtil b. Sulaymän are justified. Muqâtil was a controversial figure, attacked by some and praised by others. Until recently he has been accused of promot- ing an extreme anthropomorphism. Both Muslim and Western scholars seem to take it for granted that Muqâtil had a bad reputation for one thing because he was an anthropomorphist who had no qualms in assigning to God such human attributes as bodily parts. What surprises us is that even though recent Western scholarship on the Quťánic exegesis pays much attention to MuqâtiPs tafaīr, there has not been a systematic study on his interpretation of the anthropomorphic expressions in the Qur'ân.4 This article shows that a closer reading of his tafilr presents a different picture. Muqâtil put forth a complex view of the anthropomorphic expressions in the Quťán, one that makes it difficult to simply label him an extreme anthropomorphist. In addition to examining the sources from which the anthropomorphic views were attributed to Muqâtil, this article also ques- tions the reliability of those sources in light of the theological contestation in early Islam. 1. Between Condemnation and Admiration Muqâtil was born in the city of Balkh in Khurāsān (that now comprises parts of Iran, Afghanistan, and beyond). No biographical works have men- tioned the date of his birth, though they mentioned that Muqâtil died at Basra in 150/767.5 He is reported to be a close ally of Šālim b.

Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 al-MazInī, the commander of the last Umayyad governor Nasr b. Sayyâr (d. 131/748) in Khurāsān. Šālim nominated him as his representative to negotiate against his rival, the rebel al-Hārith b. Suraij (d. 120/738).6 He was most likely no less than 40 years old at the time and, therefore, he was pos- sibly born in year 80. Some biographers mention that there was a heated theological debate took place in the mosque Marw between Muqâtil and Jahm b. Safwân (d. 128/746) concerning God's attributes. The debate was so intense that subsequently each one wrote a book critiquing the other. Since Muqâtil had highly respected position in Khurāsān and the fact that he was a close ally to Šālim, he was able to expel Jahm from Balkh to Tarmadz.7 It seems that the problem between Muqâtil and Jahm was not merely theo- logical, but also political one. While Muqâtil represented Šālim in the polit- ical negotiation, Jahm represented Hārith. In subsequent battle in year 128/746, Jahm was killed by Šālim himself.8 Muqâtil spent his earlier life in Khurāsān, especially in two big cities: Balkh and Marw. In the pre-Islamic era, Balkh was the center of religious diversity and obviously had major impact on MuqâtiFs religious view. He then went to Marw where he got married. Therefore, he was sometimes referred to as "Balkhr, "MarwazI (Marw)", and "Khurāsān!." The importance of Marw can be seen from the fact that Abū Muslim al-Khurāsānī (d. 138/ 755) chose Marw as the center of 'Abbāsid propaganda activity against the Umayyad dynasty. In the inaugural years of the 'Abbāsid rule, Muqâtil, like many Khurāsānis, migrated to westward to centers of political power in Iraq. He settled first in Basra and then moved to Baghdad, whose founda- tion by the caliph Abū Jacfar al-Mansùr as the capital is dated to within a decade of MuqâtiPs death. He returned to Basra until he died in 150. Some sources indicate that Muqâtil frequented the 'Abbāsid court.

Muqâtil responded: Tes, in order to humble the tyrants ( jabbārin ) with it." And Mansūr was just quiet.9 He certainly liked the 'Abbāsids better, perhaps because he was a Zaydl.10 If it is true that Muqâtil had ascribed to God "flesh and blood," certainly the places where he grew and lived have a great influence on his controver- sial views. As mentioned earlier, Balkh was the city of diverse religions. In the eighth through tenth centuries, Khurāsān was one of the most impor- tant centers of the religious thought in Islam. Khurāsān produced a num- ber of prominent scholars in hadīth , tafsīr , and fiqh. Basra was also known for its diversity in terms of religious sects. Muqâtil remained in Basra and encountered many conflicting theological views in which different groups like Shlťa, Khawärij, Mu'tazila and others were involved in serious theo- logical discussions. Abū Hātim b. Hibbān (d. 354/965) has listed three pos- sible reasons why Muqâtil has a bad reputation: "He relied on Jewish and Christian sources in his interpretation of the Qur'ân; he was also an anthro- pomorphist assimilating God to His creatures; and in addition he used to forge hadīths."11 Of these three reasons, it is the last factor that has been widely discussed in biographical works (kutub al-rijāl)t a sub-genre of biographical diction- aries designed to evaluate the truthfulness of hadīth transmitters. Many muhaddithün have discredited Muqâtil for being reckless and inaccurate in his use of the isnãd (chain of transmission). One anecdote presents him showing off about his personal acquaintance with scholars on whose authority he transmitted hadīths of the Prophet, among them is the famous al-Kalbl. Muqâtil used to tell the people about the tradition from the author- ity of Kalbl, saying: "Abū al-Nasr [the epithet of Kalbl], told me." Once upon a time Kalbl confronted him by saying: "O Abū al-Hasan [the epithet of Muqâtil]. I am Abū al-Nasr and I've never said about that tradition." Muqâtil replied: "Shut up, O Abū al-Nasr! We just adorn the tradition with people's 9 Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, p. 160; Dhahabī, Tahdhīb tahdhīb al- kamãl, vol. 9, p. 89; Dhahabī, Tarīkh ai-Islam , p. 639; MizzI, Tahdhīb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 439- 10 Patricia Crone, "A Note on Muqâtil b.

Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 name."12 On another occasion he told the people about the tradition from the authority of Mujāhid b. Jabr, then someone in the audience stood up and said: "I am Mujāhid, but I've never met you!" Without blinking an eye Muqâtil retorted: "That doesn't matter, what matters is the content of the story."13 Muqâtil was once confronted by Ibn ťUyayna: 'Tou have transmit- ted the tradition from the authority of al-Dahhāk, but the muhaddithün claim that you have never met him." He simply replied: "The door was closed for me and him,"14 referring to his secret meeting with Dahhāk. He is accused of not only transmitting hadīths from people he did not meet, but also proposing to forge the prophetic traditions. It is reported that Muqâtil proposed to the 'Abbāsid caliph to fabricate the hadīth in his favor. For instance, he said to al-Mahdl: "If you wish, I will make up some hadīths for the 'Abbāsids?" Mahd! responded: "I don't need them."15 Once upon a time someone came to Muqâtil and said that he was asked about the color of the dog of ashãb al-kahf (the people of the cave whose story is mentioned in sūra al-Kahf ). "I have no idea what I should say," he said. Muqâtil said to him: "O a fool, if you said yellow or whatever, who would refute you."16 For some muhaddithün , this statement indicates that Muqâtil was not only a liar but also taught how to lie. His prestige in the eyes of the muhaddithün is very low, and therefore his hadlth is da "If (weak) and matrük (abandoned).17 In light of this accusation, we need to examine the hadīth in his entire works available to us now. Since this is beyond the scope of our research, it suffices for us to refer to the very brief observation by Abdullah Shahhāta, the editor of Muqätil's two major works, namely Tafaïr Muqâtil b. Sulaymãn and al-Ashbãh wa al-nazā'ir. 12 Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, pp. 163-164; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb altahdhīb, vol. 10, pp. 282-183; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamāl, vol. 28, pp. 445-446. 13 Kees Versteegh, Landmarks in Linguistic Thought III : The Arabic Linguistic Tradition, p. 13. 14 Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb al-tahdhīb, vol. 10, p. 280; Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, p. 165; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamāl, vol. 28, p. 441. 15 See: Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdādt vol. 13, p. 167; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamāl, vol. 28, p. 446; Dhahabī, Tahdhīb tahdhīb al-kamāl , vol. 9, p. 90. 16 Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdād, vol. 13, p. 165; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb al-tahdhībt vol. 10, p. 282; Dhahabī, Tahdhīb tahdhīb al-kamāl, vol. 9, p. 90. 17 Dhahabī quotes the statements by Bukhārī, Yazîd b. Zurať, Wáqť, Ibn Main, Abū Dâwud, Abū Hātim, and Nasā'i, all of whom accused Muqâtil with the stron- gest condemnation, such as "kadhdhãb" (liar), "matrük al-hadīthn (his hadīth aban- doned), and " daīf * (weak).

Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 43 I have investigated the ahādlth (plural of hadlth) cited by Muqätil in his tafsïr, and I found that most of them have been there in the books of Sahlh [referring to Sahīh al-Bukhārl and Muslim] and the books of Sunan We rarely find the weak hadlth in his tafsir.18 Shahhāta's observation obviously does not confront the huge hadlth lit- eratures that have depicted Muqätil as a liar, but, at the very least, it shows that even though he was known as a liar in the hadlth, this phenomenon is not reflected in his tafsir. The muhaddithün have characterized Muqätil as "matrük al-hadlth" (his hadlth transmission should be rejected) and "majhül al-qawl" (his opinion should be ignored) not only for his habitual telling of lies in the hadlth transmission, but also because "he used to talk about God's attributes which nobody would be allowed to transmit from him (kãnayatakallam fi al-sifāt bimã lãyahillu al-ríwãya * anhu )."19 Surprisingly, in spite of this wide range of accusations by traditionalists, a number of well-known scholars praise MuqâtiPs works, especially in the field of Quťánic exegesis. Shāfi'ī (d. 204/820), the founder of the Shāfi'I school of thought, is reported to have said: "The people who want to study the Quťánic commentary should rely considerably on Muqätil b. Sulaymân."20 He compares Muqätil's knowledge on tafsir with Abū Hanlfa on fiqh and Zuhayr b. Abl SullamI on poetry. Another report on the author- ity of Rābi' b. Sulaymân that Shāfi'I said: "Whoever wants to study tafsir he has to rely on Muqätil; whoever wants to study hadlth he has to rely on Mālik; and whoever wants to study disputation he has to rely on Abū Hanīfa."21 Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 241/855) was asked about Muqätil, and said: "some of his works are disputed, but I myself see that he has knowledge in the Quťán."22 Hammād b. Abi Hanlfa (son of Abū Hanlfa) is reported to praise Muqätil as more knowledgeable than Kalbl.23 The noted historian Yüsuf al-MizzI (d. 742/1341) begins his biographical note on Muqätil by 18 Shahhāta, in his introduction to al-Ashbãh wa al-nazâ'ir, p. 45. 19 Baghdādī, Tarlkh al-Baghdãd, 13: 163; Mizzī, Tahdhlb al-kamãl , vol. 28, p. 445. 20 In Tarlkh al-Baghdãd, Shāfi'ī is reported to have said: "All people depend upon three: upon Muqätil in tafsir, upon Zuhayr b. Abi Salmi in poetry, and upon Abū Hanīfa in fiqh " See Baghdādī, Tarlkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, p. 161. Compare with MizzI, Tahdhlb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 436; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhlb al-tahdhlb , vol. 10, p. 279; Dhahabī, Tahdhlb tahdhlb al-kamãl, vol. 9, p. 88; Dhahabī, Tarlkh al-Islam, p. 642. 21 See Mizzī, Tahdhlb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 436. 22 Baghdādī, Tarlkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, p. 161. 23 Mizzī, Tahdhlb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 440; Dhahabī, Tahdhlb tahdhlb alkamãl, vol. 9, p. 89.</page><page sequence="7">44 M.

It is worthwhile that some biographical works that mention those accusa- tions, also mention some possible reasons for the muhaddithüri s condem- nation of Muqâtil. Ibn Hajar and BaghdādI report the story in which al-Qāsim b. Ahmad al-Saffar asked Ibrāhim al-Harbl: "Why do the people condemn Muqâtil?" Ibrahim replied: "Because of envy from them ( hasadan minhum)"25 Yahyâ b. Shibl also reported that he was asked by 'Ubbād b. Kathlr: 'What prevents you from Muqâtil?" Yahyâ answered: "Because the people of our country hate him." 'Ubbād then said: "No, don't hate him. No one is more knowledgeable about the Book of God than him."26 2. Muqâtil and His Tafeīr In the last few years, MuqâtiPs tafeīr attracts the scholars1 attention, perhaps because it is the earliest tafeīr produced by Muslims which is extant today. Kees Versteegh describes MuqâtiPs tafeīr as "by far the most independent and interesting of the early commentaries."27 Elsewhere Versteegh calls this tafeīr "one of the earliest products of Quťánic scholarship in Islam,"28 and compares its claim to authenticity favorably against other early tafeīr works such as those of Mujāhid (d. 104/722) and Sufyân al-Thawiī (d. 161/778). Regula Forster remarks that the fluency of MuqâtiPs tafeīr comes from the fact that he did not yet need to discuss alternative interpretation, and thus 24 Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamãl, vol. 28, pp. 434-9. 25 Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb al-tahdhīb, vol. 10, p. 280; Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, pp. 162-63; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 438. 26 Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdãd, vol. 13, p. 162; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb altahdhīb, vol. 10, p. 280; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 438. 27 Kees Versteegh, Arabic Grammar and Qur'ânic Exegesis in Early Islam (Leiden: E.J.

Siny / Studia Islamica íoy (2012 ) 38-64 45 could simply give his own explanation.29 For modern scholars, Muqâtil's tafslr provides resourceful information on anything "Islamic" before the establishment of orthodoxy. It is hardly surprising that many Western scholars use his tafslr as a fascinating source of information on various themes. Versteegh uses it to analyze the development of grammatical doc- trine before Sibawayh.30 Gordon Nickel uses it to investigate early Muslim accusations of tahrlf that is, the falsification of previous scriptures.31 Arguably Muqâtil's tafsīr is the oldest complete edited commentary in good condition. This tafslr is a complete commentary as opposed to a col- lection of quotations from later commentaries, and Versteegh suggests that the kind of exegesis it represents belongs to the most primitive form of commentary on the Quťán.32 Muqâtil belongs to a generation of exegetes whose main purpose is to explain the text of the Quťán for the common believers. In most of the cases he supplies glosses and explanatory notes for words or expressions that might not be immediately understood by the reader. His primary device of elucidation is the simple juxtaposition of text and paraphrase, sometimes introduced by explanatory notes such as "yaW ("it means", "that is to say", "e.i.", "the intention is") and "yaqülu" ("he says"). In some cases Muqâtil does not limit his comments or explanations to the individual verse, but extends his observations to the rest of the Quťán. In the later tafelr literatures, this type of exegesis is known as "Tafelr Qur'dn bi al-Quťán". In many cases he refers to specific parallels, mostly with the expressions "kamã qãla ", "fadhãlíka qawluhü" or "mithla qawlíhl" A fine example of reference to other parts of the Quťán comes in the extended explanatory section following Q.2:i-5, where quotations from Q.3:i-7 are used to support not only Muqâtil's interpretation of &lt;3.2:1-5, but also the 29 Regula Forster, "Methoden arabischer Quťánexegese: Muqâtil ibn Sulaymân, at-Tabarî und ťAbdurrazzaq al-Qashani zu Q 53, 1-18," in I.P.

Muqâtil sometimes takes time to gloss or explain his cross references as well.33 John Wansbrough uses MuqâtiPs tafsīr extensively as an example of what he calls "haggadic exegesis", i.e., commentary which tells the text of the Quťán as one continuous story.34 Muqâtil endeavors to explain the dis- jointed words of the Quťán by providing a narrative framework, which takes the central place as the generator of meaning. The effect of this narra- tive style of exegesis, as Gordon Nickel points out, "is to give continuity and wholeness to the text of the Quťán."35 The use of connectives - as well as the absence of connectives - between the Quťánic text and exegesis clearly indicates the importance of the narratio in Muqátil's tafsīr. It is through this narratio that he was able to smooth out the disjointed nature, incompleteness and vague references of the verses. He sometimes rephrases Quťánic clauses in the mood of "in other words . . .," but he also provides detail information to entertain the curious reader. His identification of anonymous references creates familiarity with the text and enhances the quality of the narrative.36 One of the most striking characteristics of MuqâtiPs tajsir is that he almost has left nothing unexplained. Every details, every vague references in the Quťán, even such general references as to the mushriküna, or to munäfiküna, is spelled out. Nothing and nobody is left anonymous. A characteristic example is when he adds to the phrase " qälat al-yahüdu" ((3.5:64): ya*nī ihn Surayya wa Finhãs al-yahüdiyaini wa (Āzir bin Abī ! Āzir 37 Perhaps, the most absurd example of this type of exegesis is when he offers the information that the ant who talked to Sulaymän (Q.27:i8) was called al-Jarml,38 and the name of the dog of the ashãb al-kahf( the people of the 33 See Gordon Nickel, The Theme of "Tampering with the Earlier Scriptures" in Early Commentaries on the Quťán , (PhD dissertation: University of Calgary, 2004), p. 62. 34 John Wansbrough, Quťánic Studies : Sources and Methods of Scriptural Inter- pretation (London: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 122-48. 35 Nickel, The Theme of " Tampering with the Earlier Scriptures" in Early Com- mentaries on the Quťán , p. 63. 36 Ibid. 37 Muqâtil b.

On the creation of the heavens and the earth in six days (Q.io:3), he says that God created the heavens on Sunday and Monday, the earth on Tuesday and Wednesday, and everything between the two on Thursday and Friday.40 He sometimes alludes to the historical events ( asbãb al-nuzül) to which the Quťán refers, which are usually introduced by the formulas "nazalatfi. . ." and "wa dhālika anna "It seems that Muqätil was well informed both about the detail of the life of the Prophet and about the biblical stories to which the Quťán refers, especially with regard to the stories of the previous Prophets. We know that he had at his disposal Jewish and Christian sources, and one of the criticisms that are directed to him is that he put his trust completely in what later tradition called the " isrâ'Lliyyâf 41 Muslim scholars often consider MuqâtiPs use of isrâ'iliyyât as one of the most obvious defects ( cuyüb ) of his tafsīr ,42 Since a number of theological is clear that the source of the ant's name must be either from isrä'iliyyät (biblical stories) or mawdü'ät (fabricated traditions)." 39 Tafsīr Muqãtil bin Sulaymãn , vol. 2, p. 578. 40 Ibid., p. 225. 41 Isrä'iliyyät is a term that is often mentioned in the Quťánic exegesis to refer to Biblical stories which was collected in medieval tafsīr and tarīkh collections. Calder suggests that the term isra'iliyyat entered into exegetical terminology with Ibn Kathīr to designate material collected by previous generation of exegetes to which objections were raised. See Norman Calder, "Tafsīr from Tabarī to Ibn Kathīr: Problems in the description of a genre, illustrated with the reference to the story of Abraham," in eds. G.R. Hawting and Abdul-Kader A Shareef, Approaches to the Qur'än, (London, 1993), p. 137. Andrew Rippin deals with this issue in the same book, says: "the rise and employment of this term isrďiliyyát deserves a special study; my impression is that it comes into wide circulation as a pejorative term is tafsīr - material which is not to be accepted as valid in interpretation - only with . . . Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Kathīr." See Rippin, "Interpreting the Bible through the Quťán, in Approaches to the Qur'än, 258. For a more discussion, see M.J.

In his lengthy study on Muqâtil's tafsīr , Shahhāta provides some examples where Muqätil used the Christian and Jewish sources; he also mentions the views of some scholars of the tafsīr concerning the ism'iliyyat. What is interesting to note is that although many scholars have warned against the use of the isrä'iltyyat sources, Shahhātah observes that many of them in fact used it extensively in their tafsīr, like Tabarī, Baghawî, al-Khazīn, Ibn Kathīr, Qurtubî, and others.

Sirry / Studia Islamica ìoj (2012 ) 38-64 points had not yet been entirely fixed at the time of its composition, certain positions are discernible in his tafilr that must have shocked later orthodox sentiment. Muqätil was apparently not interested in some issues which for latter generations of exegetes become controversial. For example, he deals with foreign words in the Quťánic extensively without any hesitation. He states, for instance, the Quťánic word qistãs derived from Greek to mean "scales" ( mīzān ),43 istabraq from Persian "brocade" ( dībāj )",44 and points to the Hebrew origin of the word yamm "sea" {bahr) in Egypt45 or the Syriac origin of tãhã "Oh man" ( yã rajul ).46 For orthodox Muslims who believed the Quťán as God's literal spoken word, it is impossible to accept that the Quťán could contain any loanwords or neologism, since that would imply a change in the divinity. Therefore, they spent a lot of efforts on proving that words like qistãs or istabraq belonged to an Arabic root, or, at the very least, that these words had already existed in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Claude Gilliot argues that MuqâtiPs remarks on a number of Hebrew fig- ures represent a period prior to the development of the doctrine of the infallibility ( €isma ) of prophets. His discussion of the thoughts of Joseph in (3.12:24, the behavior of David with Bathsheba, and the story of Solomon and the statue, for example, shows a freedom of interpretation that was not open to Muslim scholars of a later period.47 Another example is with regard to the meaning of anthropomorphic passages in the Quťán. Muqätil makes no effort to emphasize or de- emphasize their meaning except by paraphrasing and glossing them the same way as other verses. As will be discussed in more detail later, it seems that Muqätil had no problem at all with either the literal or metaphorical interpretation of such verses. Gilliot remarks, "Muqätil's recently published commentaries do show traces of anthropomorphic thinking, although not to the extent ascribed to him."48 Unfortunately, Gilliot has not gone far enough to thoroughly examine Muqätil's approach to the anthropomor- phic expressions in the Quťán. It is my contention that the case of Muqätil 43 Tafilr Muqätil bin Sulaymãn , vol. 2, p. 530. 44 Ibid., p. 584. 45 Ibid., p. 59. 46 Ibid., p. 20. 47 Gilliot, "Muqätil, Grand Exégète, Traditionniste et Théologien Maudit," pp. 70-72. 48 Gilliot, "Exegesis of the Quťán: Classical and Medieval," in ed.

Was Muqâtil an Extreme Anthropomorphist? In this section, we will examine closely MuqâtiPs interpretation of the seemingly anthropomorphic expressions in the Qur'än. To begin with, the Quťán describes the divine attributes of God in a very interesting way. On the one hand, the Qur'än states that there is nothing that equals God, and that He has no like (Q.42:n; 112:4), but on the other hand, it describes Him as having a face, hand, and eyes, and as talking and sitting on the throne and as having feeling. Many prophetic traditions also support the claim that God has a body. The striking thing is that although this fairly moderate application of anthropomorphism by the Quťán compared to, for instance, the Bible, the Muslims prove to be puzzled by those divine analogies of human nature found in the Quťán. The first question comes to mind is: What is the proper way of looking at them? Are they to be taken literally, or do they ask for a figurative or metaphorical interpretation, or is a mediatory position on this point conceivable? MuqâtiPs discussion of the anthropo- morphic expressions in the Qur'än is complex in the sense that although he seems to take them at face value, he also interprets them metaphorically. He approaches the apparently anthropomorphic verses in rather interest- ing way as he interprets them differently according to different contexts. On God's Face Among the verses used by anthropomorphists ( mushabbihün ) to support their position is the expression "wajhuhü (His face)" or "wajh rabbika (the face of your God)", and other similar expressions that apply "the face" to God. For an extreme anthropomorphist, the word "wajh (face)" should be understood as a bodily organ like our face. For anthropomorphists in gen- eral, the expression of "wajh" should be taken literally to mean an attribute (Sifa) added to the essence of God, without asking how (bilã kayf ).49 The Mu'tazila who deny the tashbīh interpret it metaphorically as Goďs 49 Abū Yaclā, Kitãb al-Mu'tamad fi usül al-dīn, ed.

Siny / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 essence.50 MuqâtiPs position on this issue, as on other issues of the anthro- pomorphic expressions, is not monolithic in the sense that he interprets them metaphorically in one place and literally in another. In what follows we provide a full citation of MuqâtiPs commentary on some Quťánic pas- sages related to the face of God, and followed by some general discussions. (Please note that the Quťánic passages will be italized and put in brackets the same way they appear in his tafslr.) On sūra al-Kahf (18): 28 (Keep yourself patient with those who callón their God) means: they wor- ship their God, that is, with the prayer to Him, (at the morning and the evening ), the two sides of the day, (they want the face of God) means: by their prayer and fasting they seek the face of their God.51 On sūra al-Qasas (28): 88 (There is no god but He, everything perishes except His face) He says: every living thing will die, He then makes an exception of Himself the greatest, that God the most high is living eternally and will not die, so God said: (except His face) means: except Him.52 On sūra al-Insān (76): 9 (We are feeding you solely for the face of God) means: for the satisfaction of God, the highest, (we don't want compensation from you nor thanks) means that you praise us with it.53 On sūra al-Layl (92): 19-20 (Without favor to be paid to any one) , and that is that Abū Bakr passed on Bilāl the muazzin and his master Umayya b. Khalaf al-Jamhl... [Muqâtil explains the historical context of this verse], (only seeking the face of his God the highest ), the high over His creation.54 50 Zamakhshan explains the expression " everything perishes except His face" (Q.28: 88) as meaning "except Him", and then adds "the face is expressed to mean the essence (al-wajh yu'abbar 'art al-dhāt)" See Zamakhsharī, al-Kashshãf 'an Haqãiq ghawãmid al-tanzīl wa ' uyün al-aqāwīl fi wujüh al-TakwU, eds. ťAdil Ahmad Abdul Mawjud and Ali Muhammad Mu'awwaz, (Riyadh: Maktabah al-'ubaykan, 1998), vol. 4, p. 531- 51 Tafsîr Muqãtil bin Sulaymãn , vol. 2, p. 582. 52 Ibid., vol. 3, p. 360. 53 Ibid., vol. 4, P. 525. 54 Ibid., pp. 723-24.</page><page sequence="14">M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 51 The above passages represent the whole ranges of his approach to the Quťánic verses concerning the face of God, either he uses a figurative inter- pretation or takes it literally, and in most of the cases he leaves the term unexplained. There is no single hermeneutic method, all he does is follow the text and explain anything that may be unclear to the reader. Muqâtil interprets "yuñdüna wajkahu " (Q.i8:28) to mean "seeking the face of their God" the same way he interprets 6:52. But there is no pattern since he chooses not to explain the same phrase in 30:38 "yuñdüna wajh Allah". The most interesting thing is his interpretation of 28:88 in which he employs a figurative method the same way as the Mu'tazila do, that is, by interpret- ing illã wajhahü as "Lllã huwa (except Him)." The same method he applies to 2: 115 in which he interprets fa aynamã tuwallü fa thamma wajh Allah (wherever you turn, there is the face of God) as means "fa thamma Allah (there is God)." In this context, Muqâtil is obviously in line with the Mu'tazila who state that God's face indicates His essence. The Mu'tazila reject the view that God has a face based on the argument of the unity of God. God is one and has no parts, therefore it is inconceivable that part of Him should remain. The third quotation from the Tafeîr Muqâtil on sūra al-Insān (76): 9 shows clearly that Muqâtil interprets "wajh Allah (the face of God)" metaphorically as "mardāt Allah (the satisfaction of God)," which also does not support the accusation that Muqâtil was an anthropomor- phism let alone an extreme one. The last quotation above shows another example of his method of explicating the Qur'ânic passage. As for the Quťánic phrase: "illã ibtighä'wajh rabbihlal-ď lã (only seeking the face of his God the highest), Muqâtil chooses to explain the term "a'lā (the high- est)," rather than "wajh rabbihl (the face of his God)." In fact, he does not give his explanation for the same phrase "ibtighâ'wajh Allah " in 2:272 and 13:22. On God's Eye The Quťán also describes God as having * ' ayn (eye)." The term " (aynn and its plural form (ayun) assigned to God appears five times in the Quťán, which has been interpreted differently by different exegetes along the line of their theological orientation. Zamakhshar! (d. 538/1144), a Mu'tazill exegete, interprets the Quťánic expression "And build an ark under Our eyes" (Q.ii:37; 23:27) to mean "under Our protection and guidance as if there were God's guards with him that guide him with their eyes so that nobody</page><page sequence="15">52 M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 would destroy his work."55 Al-Qādī Abū Ya'lâ (d. 458/1066), a Hanbali tradi- tionalist, says that "God has ascribed to Himself two eyes They are two attributes added to the sight and seeing."56 Here again on the question of God's eye, Muqätil presents a complicated view taking it literally on the one hand, and interpreting it metaphorically on the other. On sūra Hūd (11): 37 [And build the ark] means: the ship and work on it, [through Our eyes ] means: through Our knowledge, [and Our revelation] like what We have ordered you. Then Noah worked on it for four hundred years and that ship was made from teak-tree.57 On sūra Tāhā (20): 39 (Andyou might be brought under My eye), when the box was cast on the sea, and when it was found, and when he was nourished, all of that was through the eye of God. When Pharaoh found Moses, God made him do not accept the breast of a woman.58 On sūra al-Qamar (54): 14 (i Coursing under Our eyes) He says: the ship is coursing in the water through the eye of God, and then God drowned the people of Noah, and that drowning is (a recompense for one who has been rejected ), means: Noah the rejected one.59 From the above passages we might have better insight how a complex is MuqätiPs approach to the anthropomorphic passages in the Quťán. The first example clearly shows that he uses a figurative method to interpret "bi ayuninã (through Our eyes)" as "bi Hlminã (through Our knowledge)." Muqätil puts an emphasis on the interplay between "God's knowledge" and "God's order" in such a way to guard Noah in his creation of an ark. However, the last two quotations seem to suggest that Muqätil uses no hermeneutical device to interpret " 'alā ' aynV (Q.2o:39) and "bi ayuninã " (Q.54^4» and see also: 52:48). These passages open for the possible reading of Muqätil as an anthropomorphist in the sense that everything that happened to Moses (he 55 Zamakhsharī, al-Kashshãf, vol. 4, p. 226. 56 Abū YaÍâ, Kitãb al-mu'tamad fi usül ai-din, p. 51. 57 Tafoīr Muqätil bin Sulaymãn , vol. 2, p. 281. 58 Ibid., vol. 3, p. 27. 59 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 179.</page><page sequence="16">M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 53 was cast off, then found and nourished) in 20: 39 and to Noah (he was safe on the ark) in 54:14, all that took place in the eyes of God (which I took to mean by virtue of the eyes of the Lord). In other words, the events in the life of Moses and Noah took place under, and thanks to, the observing gaze of the Lord. A closer look, however, reveals another possible reading of Muqâtil as non-anthropomorphist. One should note, for instance, that the first and last quotations refer to the same story of Noah in which God instructed him to build an ark to save his family and every two species on earth from a great flood. It is in this context that the phrase "bi cfyuninď occurred in both verses. Since he has interpreted it in the first verse meta- phorically, one might ask why we should take on the second verse literally. In other words, looking at Muqâtil's approach to both verses leads us to question his apparent anthropomorphism. On God's Hand In the same category are the following verses: "The Jews say the hand of God is bound Their hands were bound, and they were accursed by what they said But Goďs two hands are extended, openly giving at will" ((3.5:64); "0 Iblis, what has prevented you from bowing to what I have created with My own two hands " (Q.3875); and "Goďs hand is over their hands" (&lt;3.48:10). In his al-Ashbãh wa al-nazā'ir , Muqâtil explains three different meanings of the hand. First, the hand is understood anthropomorphically as "the hand itself (al-yad bi cayniha)t" such as the verse "what has prevented you from bowing to what I have created with My own two hands" (Q.3875), which means, according to Muqâtil, "with the hand of the Merciful the most high. He cre- ated Adam with His hand." Muqâtil explains further that "God created Adam with His hand with which He held ( qabada ) the heavens and the earth." In sūra al-Mā'ida: 64 "But His two hands are extended" , he interprets it as "the hand itself."60 Second, the hand is understood as a metaphor in the sense of providing sustenance, not a real hand, such as the verse: "The Jews say the hand of God is bound Their hands were bound" (&lt;3.5:64). Muqâtil interprets this verse to mean "they said: God restrained His hand from pro- viding sustenance for us, so the sustenance was not increased like He did at the time of the children of Israel."61 Third, the hand means "act/work ('amai)" Muqâtil particularly mentions two verses in this category: "Haven't 60 Muqâtil b. Sulaymân, al-Ashbãh wa al-nazā'ir , p. 321. 61 Ibid.</page><page sequence="17">54 M. Sirty / Studia Islamica loj (2012 ) 38-64 they seen that We created for them animals from what Our hands had worked on" (Q.3671) and "the hand of God is over their hands " ((3.48:10). Muqâtil explains the meaning of the last verse as follows: "God's generous action for them is better than their act in the bay'a (contract of loyalty) in the day of Hudaybiyya."62 In what follows we shall compare the above three interpre- tations of the hand with what Muqâtil has said in his tafeīr. On sūra al-Mā'ida (5): 64 (And the Jews said) means: Ibn Sûriyya and Finhās, the two Jews, and 'Āzir b. Abi 'Āzir, ( the hand of God is bound) which means restricted. God restricted His hand from us, so he did not extend His hand to us with sustenance, and He was not generous. And that is because God has previously extended the sustenance to them, but when they dis- obeyed and deemed lawful what was forbidden, God prevented the sustenance from them. Therefore, they said: the hand of God is pre- vented from extension. God said (their hands were bound), means: their hands were restricted from anything that is good, (and they were accursed by what they have said But His two hands are extended) with everything that is good (giving for whoever He wanted ), if God willed He extended the sustenance, and if He willed He bared it. They are only His creation and servants in His hold.63 On sūra Yäsin (36): 71 (Haven't they seen that We created for them from what Our hand has made) from Our work (animals) camel, cow, and sheep (so they are the possessors of those animals) they have control over them.64 On sūra al-Fath (48): 10 (The hand of God) by keeping His promise to provide them with any- thing that is good (is over their hands) when they told the Prophet, peace be upon him: "We make an agreement with you that we will not escape and will fight, so please consider that for us."65 The comparison between his al-Ashbãh wa al-nazā'ir and his Tafeīr on this theme reveals somewhat contradictory accounts. Before proceeding to this 62 Ibid. 63 Tafsir Muqâtil bin Sulaymãn , vol. 1, p. 490. 64 Ibid., vol. 3, p. 584. 65 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 70.</page><page sequence="18">M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 55 comparison, the following observation is in order. First, Muqâtil comments on "God's hand" only in the three places cited above. Second, every prepo- sitional phrase of "hand" such as biyadihi, biyadika, biyadayya , or bayna yadayAllah and baynayadayhi is not followed by explanatory notes. There- fore, the verse 38: 75: " mā mana' aka an tasjuda Urnā khalaqtu biyadayya [what has prevented you from bowing to what I have created with My own two hands)" is not followed by any explanation of what "My own two hands " means for him, in spite of the fact that Muqâtil himself claims in the al-Ashbãh that this "My own two hands " should be understood anthropo- morphically as "the hand itself ( al-yad bi cayniha).n Another striking com- parison is that the second part of the verse 5:64 "balyadãhu mabsūtatān (but His two hands are extended)" is also not explained in the Tafoīr , while in the al-Ashbãh it is said to be understood figuratively. What seems to be contradictory is the way Muqâtil explains the first part of verse 5:64 "yad Allah maghlülah (the hand of God is bound)" which, according to him, it means "God restrained His hand (amsaka Allah yadahü)" in literal sense, while in the al-Ashbãh he refers to this phrase as metaphor of providing sustenance. However, this seemingly contradictory account can be resolved by arguing that Muqâtil understands the phrase "amsaka Allah yadahü" as an Arabic idiom: "He prevented Himself to help". For, it becomes an Arabic idiom that masīk means miser ( bakhīl ). In the Lisãn al-'Arabt Ibn Manzūr writes: rajulun masīkun ay bakhllun amsaka mä fiyadayhi lâyu'tîhi ahadan (rajulun masīkun means a miser who restricts what is in his hands and does not give it to anyone).66 On God's Sitting on the Throne The Quťán mentions God's throne twenty two times out of which seven occurrences are related to God's sitting on the throne. Generally the Quťán depicts God, after creating the heavens and the earth, seated upon His throne and guiding the universe. But, as will be seen later, Muqâtil goes to the reverse: He seated on His throne before creating the heavens and the earth. The imagery of God sitting on the throne has been at the center of much discussion in classical Islamic theology, for it raises the question of whether and to what degree one ought to interpret the Quťán literally. Taken literally, the text conjures up anthropomorphic pictures of God: there is a throne and God actually sits upon it, and so forth. Taken 66 Ibn Manzūr, Lisãn al-'Arab (Beirut: Dar sādir, 1956), vol. 10, p. 488.</page><page sequence="19">56 M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 ( 2012 ) 38-64 metaphorically, the text becomes a colorful reference to divine sovereignty and transcendence. Zamakhshari explains "God's sitting on the throne" as a figurative equivalent of "he is king" (kinâyah 'an al-mālik).67 MuqâtiPs take on this theme can be represented by two citations below: On sūra Yünus (10): 3 {Surety it is your God, Allah, who created the heavens) on Sunday and Monday {and) created {the earth) on Tuesday and Wednesday, and cre- ated whatever between the two on Thursday and Friday {in six days, then He seated on the throne)} there is "taqdlm" in this verse {then He seated on the throne ), then He created the heavens and the earth.68 On sūra Tāha (20): 5 {The Merciful seated on the throne) "taqdlm" (in advance) before the creation of the heavens and the earth, which means: He resided/ settled.69 While the meaning of the "God seated on the throne" verses has been a source of contention throughout the history of Islamic thought, Muqätil treats this issue very slightly. Among the seven verses dealing with " istiwã ralā al-'arsh (God's sitting on the throne)," he only provides the explanation of verse 10: 3, in which he states that the meaning of istawã is istaqarra (to reside, to establish oneself, to settle). What concerns Muqätil most is the logical order of creation that the Quťán tells us, that is, that God seated on the throne after He has created the heavens and the earth. Muqätil insists in his explication of all the seven verses that God seated on the throne before He created the universe. The technical term he uses in this context is "taqdlm". For later grammarians, the term "taqdlm" is used only in the sense of "transposed order in the sentence,"70 while Muqätil uses it in its original sense of "putting one thing before the other." It is understandable because the term "taqdlm" was not yet a technical term at the time of Muqätil.71 So, the motif for pointing out taqdlm in the verse is, apparently, that the logical order of the actions mentioned in the verse has been reversed. 67 Zamakhshari, al-Kashshãf, vol. 4, p. 67. 68 Tafiīr Muqätil bin Sulaymãn , vol. 2, pp. 225-26. 69 Ibid., vol. 3, pp. 20-21. 70 Kees Versteegh, "Grammar and Exegesis," p. 231. 71 Ibid.</page><page sequence="20">M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 57 What makes Muqâtil argue this way? It is difficult to ascertain why Muqâtil goes to the reverse, since all the seven verses that speak about God's sitting on the throne depict that God seated on His throne after the creation of the heavens and the earth. One possible reason for this is because of his understanding of sūra Hūd (11): 7 which implies - not explic- itly - that the creation of the throne was before the creation of the heavens and the earth. Sūra Hūd (11): 7: "And it i s God who created the heavens and the earth in six days while His throne was upon the water , to test which of y ou is best in conduct ." It seems that there is no specific prophetic tradition that supports MuqâtiPs view that the creation of the throne was before the heavens and the earth. Another possible reason is that Muqâtil intends to deny a statement many early Muslims attributed to the Jews that God, after working at the creation of the universe from Sunday to Friday, lays back on the throne to rest on Saturday. Here Muqâtil says that God seated on the throne before the creation of the universe, so there is no question that He took a rest on the throne after creating the heavens and the earth. Let us come back to the question of God's sitting on the throne. The word Muqâtil uses for istiwã is istiqrãr. Was Muqâtil an anthropomorphist in this regard? The answer is obviously "yes." Having said that, we have no justifi- cation whatsoever to call Muqâtil as an "extreme" anthropomorphist, since he does not explain how God resided or settled on the throne. In fact, he treats this issue and on other similar issues discussed above almost in the same way as orthodox Muslims who accuse Muqâtil of holding an extreme view of God's attributes. Both Muqâtil and orthodox Muslims treat this issue using the formula "bi Lã kayfa ", that is, "the doctrine that we are justi- fied in using mundane predicates of God bi-lã kayf without explaining exactly how they apply to Him."72 The doctrine of "bi lã kayfa n is usually referred to Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/795), who is reported to say: " istiwäuhü ma'lüm wa al-kayf minhu ghairu ma'qül wa al-su'āl canhu bid'a wa al-imãn bihi wãjid ( istiwã is known, the modality is unreasonable, questioning it is innovation, and believing in it is duty)."73 72 Montgomery Watt, "Some Muslim Discussions of Anthropomorphism," Transactions, 13 (Years 1947 to 1949): p. 4.

Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 To sum up, based on the above analysis of his commentary of some anthropomorphic passages, we can conclude that Muqâtil has different notions concerning anthropomorphic expressions in the Quťán. He is obviously anthropomorphist on the question of God's sitting on the throne. A closer look at his tafsīr reveals that he also inclines toward anthropomor- phic interpretation on the question of God's chair [kursī] (&lt;3.2:255), His right side [yamīn' ((^39:67), and the vision of God in the hereafter (Q. 75:23 ). The Mu'tazila associated this last issue with anthropomorphism, arguing that since God is neither a body nor an accident, He cannot be seen either in this world or in the hereafter. If God is a body, as the anthropomorphist maintain, He can be seen.74 On the questions of Goďs face, eyes, and hands, Muqâtil interprets them figuratively in one place and anthropomorphically in another. 4. Some Possible Explanations The above discussion on Muqâtil's interpretation of the seemingly anthro- pomorphic expressions calls into question the accusation of Muqâtil as being an extreme anthropomorphist. The question remains: Why was Muqâtil accused of promoting an extreme anthropomorphism by both the mutakallimün and muhaddithün , in spite of the fact that he himself denied such an accusation when he was confronted by the 'Abbāsid caliph and our investigation into his Tqfslr also reveals that he is far from being a propo- nent of extreme anthropomorphism? In spite of Plessneťs observation mentioned in the beginning of this article, it is possible to question the reli- ability of those sources, for a simple reason that there is no reliable source to prove that Muqâtil himself has stated such anthropomorphic views in his own works. What we have so far is the sources, other than MuqâtiPs own works, that attribute the statement of extreme anthropomorphism to him, especially in the kalām works. What makes us question the reli- ability of these sources is twofold. Firstly, the early theologian who accuses Muqâtil of being an extreme anthropomorphist is Abū al-Hasan al-Ashcar! (d. 324/935). In his Maqâlâtal-Islâmiyyîn, he ascribes to Muqâtil the follow- ing statement: biďa wa al- tmãn bihi wãjid." See: Dr. Ahmad 'Alī Tāhā Rammān, Mãlik bin Anas Imam däral-hijra (Cairo: Dar al-ťtisham, 1987), p. 75. 74 Binyamin Abrahamov, "Introduction to Kitāb al-Mustarshid " pp. 15-16.</page><page sequence="22">M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 1 07 (2012 ) 38-64 59 God is a body and corpse in the form of a man: flesh (lahm), blood (damm), hair (sha'r), bone (cazm), and He has limbs ( jawãrih ) and organs ( acda')y including hand (yad), foot (rijl), mouth ( lísãn ), head (ra's), and two eyes ( caynani ). Nonetheless, He does not resemble any- thing else, nor does anything resemble Him.75 The problem with this characterization is that there is a gap of 175 years between Muqâtil's death and Ash'arl's death, and no one has been able to explain the historical accuracy of such attribution. There is no indication that Ash'arl acquired it from any of Muqâtil's works, since he juxtaposed Muqâtil with other person, e.g. Dāwūd al-jawāribl, who said the same statement ( qãla Däwüd al-Jawâribî wa Muqâtil bin Sulaymãn : "¿nna Allah jism ..."). Possibly he acquired it from what people talked in his days about Muqâtil, which is difficult to verify. Unfortunately, this statement has had been repeated again and again by people from generation to genera- tion without being confronted with what Muqâtil himself has said in his written works. Mutahhar b. Tāhir al-MaqdisI (d. 355/966) wrote: "Muqâtil b. Sulaymãn claimed that God is a body of the bodies ( jasm min al-ajsām)t flesh, blood, and He is seven spans measured by his span."76 Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1064) expressed a similar view: "Muqâtil used to say that God is body, flesh, and blood in the human form."77 Nashwân b. Sa'īd al-HimyārI (d. 573/1178) ascribes to Muqâtil what seems to be the reason of his anthro- pomorphic view, namely, "because we cannot see something marked with hearing, sight, understanding, knowledge, life, and power, unless it is flesh and blood (illã mã kãna lahman wa damman)"7S 75 Abū al-Hasan al-Ash'arï, Maqâlât ai-Islāmiyyīn wa ikhtilãf al-musaiUn , ed. H. Ritter, (Visbadin: Dar al-nashr, 1963), p. 209. Even scholars who wrote exten- sively on anthropomorphism in Islam, such as Wesley Williams, are prone to asso- ciating the above oft-quoted statement to Muqâtil as if it came from Muqâtil's own mouth. See Wesley Williams, "A Body unlike Bodies: Transcendent Anthropomor- phism in Ancient Semitic Tradition and early Islam "Journal of American Oriental Society 129/1 (2009): p. 35. 76 Mutahhar b. Tahir al-Maqdisi, Kitāb al-baďwa al-tarlkh (Paris: Irnist li-Ru, 1919), p. 141. 77 Ibn Hazm, ai-Fasi fi al-milal wa al-ahwã 'wa al-nihal , eds. Muhammad Ibrāhīm Nasr and Abdurrahman Umayrah, ( Jiddah: Sharika al-maktaba cukaz, 1982), vol. 5, P- 74. 78 Nashwân b. Sa'ïd al-Himyârl, al-Hur al-ln, ed. Kamal Mustafa, (Egypt: Mak- tabah khanja, 1948), p. 149.</page><page sequence="23">6o M. Sirry / Studia Islamica loj (2012 ) 38-64 Secondly, the fact that this statement is found in the kalām works poses another problem, because such a statement put forth by theologians who disagree with Muqâtil's theological view. Those who are familiar with the kalām works would understand that many theologians used to exaggerate when they came to address and criticize their rival, or attribute to someone a thing he did not say in order to frighten people away from him. An accu- sation of anthropomorphism, as Abrahamov points out, "seems to have been an efficient weapon in Islamic theological struggles."79 Josef van Ess also recognizes the complexity of MuqâtiPs characterization in the heresio- graphical works, and hence "The rusticity of the argumentation may, to a certain extent, be attributed to the heresiographers: we do not have any original texts."80 It is interesting to note that there are no biographical works or historical documents that have ever attributed anthropomorphic claims to Muqâtil.81 The muhaddithün alluded to this issue vaguely as we have discussed earlier. Even if we take the kalām works as reliable sources from which we can discern MuqâtiPs anthropomorphic views, we found that their depiction of Muqâtil is not monolithic in the sense that there are other works that por- tray his views on God's attributes differently, including the famous theolo- gian Shahrastānī (d. 548/1153). In his Milalwa al-nihal , Shahrastani places Muqâtil at the same level as Mālik b. Anas on the question of God's attri- butes, and calls him among the imams of salaf (the pious Muslims of the early generations). Shahrastānī says, "Ahmad b. Hanbal and Dāwūd b. 'Alī al-Asfahānl and a group from the imams of salaf, they all followed the method of salaf before them among the people of hadlth ( ashāb al-hadīth), including Mālik b. Anas and Muqâtil b. Sulaymân."82 Unfortunately, the scholarship on Muqâtil has been driven by Ashťarl rather than Shahrastānī. It is striking that some scholars use a very harsh language against him. Dr. Muhammad Husein al-Dahabi, a prominent scholar of tafsvr , states "Muqâtil's learning embodies more evil than good, and is much more 79 Binyamin Abrahamov, "Introduction to Kitãb al-Mustarshid" p. 5. 80 Josef van Ess, The Youthful God: Anthropomorphism in Early Islam (Tempe, AZ: Arizona State University, 1988), p. 4. 81 See Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdãd, 13: 160-69; Dhahabī, Tahdhīb Tahdhīb al-kamāĻ vol. 9, pp. 87-91; Dhahabī, Tarīkh al-Islam} pp. 639-42; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamāl, vol. 28, pp. 434-51; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb al- tahdhīb, vol. 10, pp. 279-85. 82 Shahrastānī, al-Milalwa al-nihal, eds.

Sirry / Studia Islamica my (20u ) 38-64 61 harmful than beneficial."83 The author of the famous textbook al-tafslrwa al-mufassirün makes this observation after he - as he claims - has "care- fully examined Muqätil's tafoīr11 and concludes that "adherents of heretical and noxious doctrines such as anthropomorphists could find the material most conformable to their prejudices and passions, which they readily and eagerly copied."84 How could he come to such a conclusion? Muhammad b. ťAlI al-Dāwūdī (d. 945/1538) in his Tabaqât al-mufassirīn , admits that "Muqätil was defamed (lutikha) with anthropomorphism, in spite of the fact that he was among the vessels of knowledge in the tafoīr like an ocean."85 On the other different spectrum, we find Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) who attempt to question the usual accusations leveled at Muqätil. For instance, he problematizes Ash'arï's characterization of Muqätil for two reasons. Firstly, Ash'arī ascribes the statement of "God is flesh, blood . . ." to both Muqätil and Dāwūd al-jawāribl, as mentioned earlier. According to Ibn Taymiyyah, this is problematic because Dāwūd al-jawāribl was known to have said that statement, while Muqätil "only God knows the truth of his situation {fa ALLah a(lam bi haqlqati hâlihï)."86 In other words, there is no reliable source whatsoever from which we can confidently ascribe that statement to Muqätil. Secondly, Ibn Taymiyya argues that it is possible that "Ash'arī took these statements from the works of Mu'tazila, in which they falsified Muqätil."87 He prefers to open different possibilities, because "The Muctazila might have added something in their transmission from Muqätil, or they transmitted from him, or transmitted from unreliable persons."88 Therefore, Ibn Taymiyya's position on Muqätil is moderate one: Muqätil is not reliable in the hadlth , but "he is undoubtedly reliable in his knowl- edge of tafoīr and others."89 To the best of my knowledge, the earliest 83 M.

Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 scholar who based his Quťánic commentary on Muqätil was Abū al-Husayn Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Multl (d. 344/987), a Shāfi'ī jurist, who, for instance, used the term "taqdlm" with regard to the "God's sitting on the throne " verses.90 It is noteworthy that Mult! is a contemporary of Ash'arl, but he said nothing about such accusations. ZarkashI (d. 794/1392), as reflected in his al-Burhãn , is another noted scholar of the science of the Quťán who benefited from MuqâtiFs works and often mentioned him by name.91 Even if we grant that Muqätil stated such anthropomorphic views, the fact that his major works available to us present him in a different way needs further explanations. One possible explanation is that Muqätil has said that statement at the earlier time of his life and then he changed his mind. Another possibility is that those who transmitted his works had dropped it from his tafoīr , or he stated it during his debate with Jahm and did not record it in his works. Indeed, some scholars prefer the last possibil- ity. Ahmad Amin (d. 1954), for instance, argues that MuqâtiPs extremity was in response to the extreme position of Jahmiyya and Mu'tazila in negat- ing the attributes of God.92 Already before Amin, Abū Hanïfa is reported to compare the extreme position of Jahm in denying God's attributes with the other extreme of Mutaqil in affirming the human attributes of God.93 As discussed earlier, there has been a reported disputation took place between Muqätil and Jahm, and both held their views in contrast to one another.94 If it was the case, then such an incident must have taken place early in his life at least before year 128 when Jahm died. 90 Abū al-Husein Muhammad b.

Kautharī, the editor of this work, notes: "The author's rely- ing on Muqätil b. Sulaymän in his tafsîr put him in the delusion with some super- fluous opinions such as the interpretation of isttwã to mean istiqrãr." 91 Shahhāta notes: "MuqâtiPs explanations on the creation of Adam and the synchronization of those seemingly contradicted verses have influenced Zarkashi in his ai-Burhãn" Shahhāta, Tafoīr Muqätil bin Sulaymän , vol. 5, p. 71. 92 Ahmad Amin, Fajr ai-Islãm , (Cairo: Maktabah al-nahda al-Misriyya, 1964), p. 297. 93 Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb al-tahdhīb, vol. 10, p. 281; Baghdādī, Tarīkh al-Baghdād, vol. 13, p. 166; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamãl , vol. 28, pp. 442-43; Dhahabï, Tarīkh ai-Islãm , p. 641. 94 Ibn Hajar, Tahdhīb al-tahdhīb , vol. 10, p. 280; Mizzī, Tahdhīb al-kamãl, vol. 28, p. 440; Dhahabï, Tahdhib Tahdhīb al-kamãl , vol. 9, p. 89.</page><page sequence="26">M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 1 07 (2012 ) 38-64 63 5. Concluding Remarks From the above discussion we can conclude that Muqätil was not an extreme anthropomorphist contrary to the report by the later sources. Our investigation of his own writings presents us with a different picture. In a number of instances, he provides a metaphorical interpretation of appar- ently anthropomorphic passages, while in other cases he interprets them literally or gives no explanation at all. Unfortunately, it is difficult to ascer- tain when his tafslr was written, for it is possible that he was holding an anthropomorphic view of God earlier in his life, and then he changed his mind at the time when he wrote his Quťánic commentary. Based on what has been discussed above, I would argue that Muqätil cannot simply be labeled as an extreme anthropomorphist or against anthropomorphism. The fact that these accusations are not found in any of MuqätiPs works available to us makes it reasonable to suspect the reliability of the sources from which the anthropomorphic views are ascribed to him. Our suspicion becomes unavoidable because the attribution of these views to Muqätil is only found in the works of the rationalist theologians who seem to oppose MuqätiPs theological stance. Some theologians tested religious views against their own theological teachings. Thus, Muqätil who seems to take anthropomorphic passages at face value, was rejected and characterized with the worse possible accusations. There are of course a number of political and theological reasons why he was accused of promoting an extreme anthropomorphism. On the one hand, Muqätil seemed to be "too close" to the political power that most theologians and traditionalists tended to avoid. As mentioned in the begin- ning of this article, Muqätil used to visit Baghdad which was the capital of the caliphate at the time, and where he was frequently consulted by the caliphs and local authorities. There are some reports that portrayed Muqätil to have attempted to approach the 'Abbāsid caliphs by offering to fabricate traditions in their favor. These reports seem to reflect traditionalists' per- ception of an ideal 'ãlim (scholar) who should not attach to a political ruler. On the other hand, MuqätiPs theological views, to a certain extent, repre- sent a kind of openness to the influence of other religious community. He relied heavily upon Biblical stories in his interpretation of the Quťánic pas- sages and he openly acknowledged that the Quťán contains some foreign words. These two issues later on prove to very controversial. It goes without saying that MuqätiPs relations with the political ruler and his reliance on</page><page sequence="27">64 M. Sirry / Studia Islamica 107 (2012 ) 38-64 Biblical literatures add a significant fuel to his being accused of bad reputation. One Muslim author describes "the innovations ( bidď ) of Muqätil in assigning human attributes to God are too extreme to the extent that he holds a bodily description of the Almighty ( jassama )."95 This accu- sation is, of course, based on what has been said by earlier theologians, rather than on a careful examination of MuqâtiFs own writings. 95 Muhammad b.
