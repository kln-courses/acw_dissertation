<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION Matthew Day 1. Introduction If an academic enterprise is defined in part by the issues it tackles, a rough but reliable technique for judging a field's intellectual progress is to take stock of the questions it has put to rest. Does the track record suggest an encouraging trend of theoretically and empirically progres sive "problemshifts" (Lakatos 1980)? Or is the pattern one of unre solved fundamental problems being passed down from one generation of scholars to the next like a family curse? Measured against this impromptu standard, it requires a healthy dose of interpretive charity to discern genuine progress in the study of religion. Take, for exam ple, the classic "insider/outsider problem" (McCutcheon 1999). The methodological bedrock for many religion scholars is that the verdicts of religious insiders must be granted infallible first-person authority when it comes to the whys and hows. From this vantage point, the sin gle most relevant constraint on any theory about religious behavior and thought is what religious people say about themselves. In fact, this model of inquiry suggests that if an outsider's findings conflict with an insider's judgments we should treat the dispute itself as refuting evi dence for the third party's claims. Wilfred Cantwell Smith speaks for legions of religion scholars when he advises that "no statement about religion is valid unless it can be acknowledged by that religion's believ ers" (Smith 1959: 42). After all, who else is in a better position to know what is really going on when sacrifices are made or prayers raised than the sacrificing or praying agents themselves? The snag in this methodological policy is that when we yield the epistemic floor to religious insiders, academic third parties are relegated to merely translating the insider's perspective into another vocabulary and adding a few touches of ethnographic delight. The decision to grant the observations of religious insiders incorrigible status virtually guarantees that any attempt to articulate empirically vulnerable, explana tory theories about this domain of human activity will fail to get off the ground. The reason for this is simple—there cannot be a robust human science of religion if it is impossible a priori for an outsider to © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2004 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.brill.nl 16, 241-255</page><page sequence="2">242 MATTHEW DAY demonstrate that an insider is simply mistaken about the relevant whys and hows of what they are doing. While a case can be made for grant ing religious insiders uncontested authority when it comes to telling us what they think is going on when they sacrifice or pray, no one has managed to produce a compelling argument for treating these reports as necessary truths that establish the required conceptual space for all discussions. Yet, after more than half a century of debate, the field of religious studies remains saddled with the question of first- vs. third person epistemic authority. To see how a progressive academic ven ture should handle the insider/outsider question, however, we need look no further than the modern cognitive sciences. It was once a given in the philosophy of mind that each of us has privileged, unmediated first-person access to the contents and workings of our own minds. The thought was that in the mental economy of self-knowledge we all trade on reliable if not irrefutable inside infor mation. After all, who else is in a better position to know what is really going on when I am thinking or perceiving than I? Unfortunately, the swelling catalogue of research on such curious phenomena as blind sight, hemineglect, and anosognosia proves just how wrong we can be when issuing judgments about the mind's operations from the inside. Consider the humble blind spot. The region of the eye where the optic nerve axons exit the retina—usually referred to as the optic disk or optic nerve head—lacks photoreceptors. This innocent anatomical fact results in a light insensitive area or "blind spot" in our field of vision that most of us only recognize when placed in an artificial situation specifically designed to exploit this evolutionary curiosity (see Rama chandran and Blakeslee 1998 for an entertaining series of at-home experiments). Our insider's first-person phenomenology of sight assures us that we have a seamless and richly detailed visual field "as far as the eye can see"—and we are wrong. Based on the extensive clinical and experimental evidence regarding the idiosyncrasies of human cognition and perception, there is now widespread consensus that any rigorous science of the mind must be conducted from the outsider's third-person perspective. More to the point, although first-person phenomenological reports may be treated as incorrigible when it comes to how things appear from the inside they are no more (and no less) than another set of empirical data for the third-person heterophenomenological project of scientific explana tion. While you may fee:l "thinner" after a week or two of dieting, for instance, the only way to determine if you have really lost the weight is to use the standard tools of empirical discovery (e.g., scales for mea</page><page sequence="3">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION 243 suring weight, calipers for measure body fat, and so on). "You are not authoritative about what is happening in you, but only about what seems to be happening in you," Daniel Dennett observes, "and we are giving you total, dictatorial authority over the account of how it seems to you, about what it is like to be you" (Dennett 1991: 96). Once we have a pretty good idea of what it is like to be inside the subject's skin, the cognitive scientific challenge is to construct a causal theory from the outside that can account for why the details of the phenom enological report are what they are. Because it embraces the cognitive neuroscientific commitment to and strategies for adopting the outsider's third-person perspective, the emerg ing cognitive science of religion has the potential to fundamentally trans form our approach to the study of religious thought and behavior. Where the phenomenology of religion traditionally insists that we can go no further than the evocative redescription and empathetic under standing of particular religious mental states, the new "heterophenom enology of religion" treats the recurrent patterns that phenomenological analysis reveals as one type of data for generating empirically vulner able explanatory theories.1 That is to say, people undoubtedly believe that they communicate and interact with supernatural agents like gods and spirits, and these facts—the facts about what people believe and do, and report when they reflect on these practices—are the phenom ena that any cognitive scientific theory of religion must explain. Just as cognitive neuroscientists must account for why our first-person phe nomenology of sight is demonstrably wide of the mark, for example, 1 In contemporary theory and method discussions one is often left with the impression that we have to choose between phenomenological (re)description and naturalist explanation when it comes to religion. From where I stand, this looks like an artificially forced choice. For example, because of its proprietary interest in describing the apparent structure and content of religious mental states, the phe nomenology of religion can be viewed as providing a kind of "black box" sketch of the relevant human behavioral and cognitive capacities (e.g., to have a "reli gious experience" the human information-processing system must be able to represent invisible agents). Once this list of aptitudes is complete, the heterophenomenolog ical burden is to explain how the mind's evolved design can account for these phe nomena. When viewed through this lens, these two types of scholarship begin to look like a surprisingly rational division of intellectual labor that both camps can in principle endorse. Theorists like Barney Twiss and Walt Conser would appear to sanction this arrangement from the phenomenological side of the ball when they argue that "phenomenologists, by focusing on consciously religious motives and intentions, constitute religious 'objects' of inquiry that may subsequently be inves tigated by other psycho-social disciplines interested in developing deeper explana tory and theoretic accounts of religious phenomena" (Twiss and Conser 1992: 40).</page><page sequence="4">244 MATTHEW DAY cognitive theorists of religion are obliged to explain the disconnect between what people say they believe about the gods and how they actually think about such agents (Barrett and Keil 1996). Perhaps the most important conceptual plank in this agenda is the contention that religion—notwithstanding its conspicuous weirdness at times—is not all that unique as a form of human behavioral and cognitive activity. The same collection of devices and routines that guides us through more mundane cognitive tasks is also responsible for handling our commerce with the gods. From the cognitive scientific perspective, in other words, religion is a natural consequence of the human mind's evolved design (Barrett 2000, Boyer 2003). Yet, despite the far-reaching consensus that exists on these key pro cedural and substantive points, an interesting clash of theoretical intu itions is beginning to emerge within the cognitivist fold. To a first approximation, the issue up for grabs is this: Do cultural artifacts and practices play a significant role in generating and maintaining religious cognition? Thus far the mainstream position is that cultural institutions are occasionally beautiful epiphenomenal wheels that turn but are not part of the relevant machinery of religious cognition. A growing num ber of theorists are dissatisfied with this stance, however, and argue that cultural artifacts and traditions functionally support crucial aspects of religious cognition. My hunch is that in the coming years this issue will become increasingly important in the academic study of religion— if only because the cognitive research program will begin to attract the attention of scholars who have spent their professional lives pursuing Geertzian thick descriptions of local cultural arrangements. This essay is meant to be a kind of primer for the debates over the relationship between religious culture and religious cognition that seem to be on the horizon. 2. Religious cognition and material culture: Painted spandrels or flying buttresses? There is a sense in which the disagreement over the place of mate rial culture in religious cognition can be mapped onto the logical geo graphy of the insider/outsider problem. Traditionally, the question in fields like religious studies or the philosophy of mind has been which side of a conceptual border has epistemic priority. Do insiders have privileged access to the relevant whys and hows given that they are the subjects of inquiry, or do outsiders have stable explanatory lever age by virtue of their extramural status? I have suggested that the answer to this problem should be obvious—the vision of a first-person</page><page sequence="5">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION 245 science of anything is a mirage. As Dennett notes in the cognitive neuroscientific arena, a first-person science of consciousness is "a dis cipline with no methods, no data, no results, no future, no promise" (Dennett 2001). This time around, however, the question is whether the cognitive scientific bid to explain religious thought and behavior need only address the machinery inside the head or whether it must also scrutinize the broadly cultural factors that remain permanendy out side the cranium. Since much of the discussion trades on details con cerning the architecture of human cognition, a suitably architectural version of this question can be fashioned with a dash of historical imag ination: Are the often substantial material cultures that accumulate within religious traditions principally composed of painted spandrels or flying buttresses?2 Robert McCauley has recently advanced a compelling argument for viewing all forms of cultural input as relatively extraneous, spandrel like features of religious thought and behavior. The fact that religious cognition swings free of anything peculiarly cultural becomes clear, he suggests, when we compare the "naturalness" of religion with the "unnat uralness" of science. Starting with the science side of the ledger, there are three general qualities of scientific thought which highlight its dependence on cultural scaffolding. According to McCauley science is 2 As anyone who has followed neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory over the last quarter century knows, spandrels are the roughly triangular areas that form between the right or left exterior curve of an arch—called the extrados—and an enclosing right angle or adjacent arch that are often decorated. Since Gould and Lewontin's (1978) classic essay, spandrels have been the metaphor of choice to describe non adaptive "by-products" or "side effects" of evolutionary design (see Dennett 1996 for a robust philosophical analysis). For example, Owen Flanagan calls dreams the spandrels of sleep "because dreaming is what you get as a nonadaptive side effect of putting in place certain adaptations, especially ones involving selection for sleep and sleep-cycling and ones designed to produce efficient awake minds and bod ies" (Flanagan 2000: 112). Flying buttresses have not yet made their appearance in these sorts of abstract theoretical discussions—but I hope to change that! Characteristically found in High Gothic cathedrals such as Chartres, Notre Dame and Bourges, flying buttresses are architectural elements designed to absorb and resist thrust (outward force) from the vaulted roofs of church naves. Where Romanesque architecture concealed these engineering structures, High Gothic flying buttresses are distinctive by virtue of being left permanently exposed like aban doned construction scaffolding. For the sake of clarity, I should point out that by asking if religious material culture is principally composed of painted spandrels or flying buttresses, I am not assuming that religious cognition itself is adaptive, mal adaptive or nonadaptive. Rather than addressing the evolutionary origins or ratio nale for religious thought and behavior, I am exploring a far less ambitious question: Does material culture play a causal and/or functional role in religious cognition?</page><page sequence="6">246 MATTHEW DAY (1) historically rare, (2) empirically and theoretically progressive, and (3) cognitively difficult. This last trait is particularly important for his case because it draws attention to the social practices and material arti facts we have invented along the way to make up for our cognitive limitations. There are, of course, the obvious (and increasingly old-fash ioned) pieces of lab equipment like microscopes, Bunsen burners and test tubes that promote scientific discovery by compensating for our perceptual and physiological limitations—but McCauley has something far more interesting in mind. For example, he discerns in the institutions of peer-reviewed jour nals and professional associations a shrewd practice of distributing the computational burdens (if scientific thought through carefully cultivated social networks that focus collective attention on unresolved empirical or theoretical problems. "Such communal features of the scientific enter prise establish and sustain norms that govern scientific practice," McCauley writes: "They also ensure that the collective outcome of the efforts and interactions of mistake-prone individuals and small research groups with one another in the long run is more reliable than any of their indi vidual efforts are in the short run" (McCauley 2000: 67). In addition to maintaining the scientific enterprise, these kinds of cultural arrange ments are also responsible for perpetuating it by teaching the next gen eration of scientists the intellectual and behavioral skills necessary for collecting, analyzing and explaining empirical data in reliable and pro ductive ways. As he explains, "the acquisition of scientific knowledge is a painstaking and laborious process. To become a professional sci entist requires at least a decade of focused education and training, and even then, the scientist typically only gains command of only one subfield within a single scientific discipline" (McCauley 2000: 71). Compare this scientific silhouette with religion, which is character ized as (1) historically widespread, (2) empirically and theoretically non progressive3 and (3) cognitively easy. McCauley argues that when we 3 In this sense, religion shares the same fate as the folk psychology it relies upon. In the philosophy of mind and cognitive sciences, "folk psychology" is meant to pick out the everyday conceptual vocabulary of beliefs and desires that we use to explain why someone does something. On the issue of folk psychology and empir ical progress, Patricia Churchland writes: "In contrast to the monumental progress in, say, biology or physics, folk psychology cannot claim that in the last 2000 years it has become measurably richer or more encompassing, or that it has deepened our understanding of how the mind-brain works. Seen in this light, folk psychol ogy looks like a stagnant research program doomed to frustrating ineptitude by its conceptual framework—by its misconceptions" (P.S. Churchland 1982: 1045).</page><page sequence="7">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION 247 add these traits together the obvious conclusion to draw is that "most of the cognitive activity underlying religion concerns cognitive processes that rely far less on particular cultural input, particular forms of cul tural input, or even peculiarly cultural input than is the case with sci ence" (McCauley 2000: 64). As historians and anthropologists of religion have documented in matchless detail, nearly every community that has been the subject of academic scrutiny—industrial or agrarian, literate or non-literate, pre-modern or post-modern—has religious beliefs and practices that address culturally posited superhuman, extranatural or "counter-intuitive" agents. The fact that religious thought and behav ior is so historically and sociologically widespread, even where delib erate effort has been made to root it out, provides prima facie evidence that it does not rely on any particular cultural substrate. To account for this context-independent and recurrent pattern, McCauley calls upon the assembly of cognitive devices and conceptual knowledge that is more or less in place by middle childhood. His fundamental claim is that religious thought is widespread because it is easy, and it is easy because we have our kind of mind. More pointedly, the precarious looking business of dealing with and understanding the gods is quite effortless for a cognitive system that is developmentally hard-wired for detecting agency and ascribing intentionality (Barrett, et al. 2001). The upshot of this is that although second-order theological reflection may require the same kinds of systematic education, training, and extended cultural institutions that scientific thought demand, garden variety reli gious thought does not. He summarizes the point this way: "Acquiring the knowledge necessary to participate in a religious system is much more like acquiring a natural language than it is like mastering the knowledge and skills necessary to do serious science . . . possessing every day concepts prepares people for the acquisition of religion in a way that it does not prepare them for the acquisition of science" (McCauley 2000: 80). To get religion, all we have to do is think naturally. The working hypothesis that, given the mind's design, religious cog nition is surprisingly insensitive to the vagaries of cultural input dis tinguishes the mainstream cognitive science of religion from most approaches on the current theory and method market. However, there are some theorists who are concerned that the "naturalness of religion" thesis inadvertently and unnecessarily creates a kind of insider's bias (by downplaying the ways in which the problem-solving profile of a given cognitive engine is always embedded in a web of social networks, cultural practices, and material artifacts). The worry is that if the cog nitive science of religion turns its back on the ways in which the bare</page><page sequence="8">248 MATTHEW DAY biological brain is prosthetically extended and embedded in the world, it may end up with a distorted portrait of the mind's design and of the evolutionary origins of religion. Along these lines, Harvey Whitehouse has recommended that while it "is clear that universal features of cog nitive organization set limits on the memorability of would-be cultural phenomena... we should not confine ourselves to a view of the cog nitive apparatus in isolation from the contexts in which it is activated" (Whitehouse 2001: 172). In the case of religious thought and behav ior, for instance, it is odd that so few people have underscored how we customarily find computationally relevant representations of agency— such as statues, icons, and masks—outside of our heads in a "culturally constituted material environment" of our making (Hutchins 1995: 360). Seen in this light, religious material cultures resemble collections of flying buttresses in the sense that they afford external architectural ele ments which scaffold and support the "computational thrust" of reli gious cognition. To date, Steven Mithen (1997, 1998a-b) has tendered the most substantive proposal for understanding the link between reli gious thought and non-neural cognitive resources. His project begins, as one would expect, with many of the same methodological and the oretical commitments as McCauley's. Among other things, they both agree that religious thought and behavior are natural by-products of the mind's basic architectural design. However, despite pushing off the same dock, Mithen eventually arrives at a very different set of con clusions. One reason for this is that he extracts an atypical lesson from the counter-intuitive nature of religious thought. Pascal Boyer has convincingly demonstrated that religious concepts routinely violate some of our intuitive ontological expectations about the world while preserving others. Supernatural agents like ghosts and gods cohere with our default folk psychological assumptions about agents inasmuch as they have beliefs and desires, make decisions, perceive cur rent events, recall past experiences and can understand our attempts to communicate with them (see also McCauley and Lawson 2002). Yet, what is distinctive about these supernatural or extrahuman agents is that they simultaneously breach our expectations about agents by pos sessing counter-intuitive biological and physical properties (e.g. these agents don't die, can pass through solid objects, know and see every thing, etc.). The conventional cognitive explanation for this recurrent pattern is that modest counter-intuitiveness is a causally efficacious prop erty for religious concepts when it comes to inter- and intra-genera tional cultural transmission. Their intuition-preserving traits make them easy to acquire, memorize and understand while their intuition-violating qual</page><page sequence="9">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION 249 ities make them attention-grabbing and thus easy to transmit. Religious categories that manage to strike the right balance between preserving and violating our intuitive expectations are said to achieve a kind of cognitive optimum, and the "hypothesis is that religious representations that are cognitively optimal will be the most recurrent ones. Being easier to learn and memorize, they will have greater 'survival value,' in terms of cultural transmission, than other representations" (Boyer 1994: 406). Where Boyer and others regard the counter-intuitive nature of reli gious thought as something that makes it computationally undemand ing for a mind like ours, Mithen, however, argues that religious thought is rather difficult for precisely this reason. His approach is informed by an arresting—but, one should point out, highly speculative—evo lutionary vision of the human mind's increasing cognitive fluidity as the proto-human architecture of rigid domain-specific modularity gave way to an integrated structural design. The cognitive architecture of modern Homo sapiens is said to be distinct because it allows function ally specialized mental subsystems to share information across party lines. The conceptual knowledge that was once permanently fixed in one "bundle" of domain-specific competences now becomes data avail able to other parts of the control system (Mithen 1996). Mithen believes the capacity for thinking that simultaneously cuts across two or more domains yields both adaptive and non-adaptive cognitive consequences. On the adaptive side of the equation, for example, the ability to estab lish social relationships with non-human elements of the natural world— which requires integrating our "social exchange" and "natural history" intelligences—is what allows us to do such things as domesticate wild animals and plants. On the nonadaptive side, the capacity for think ing about non-human elements of the natural world as if they were one of us produces anthropomorphic and anthropopyschic religious concepts.4 Mithen contends that domain-blurring cognition is trickier than its domain-specific cousin because no neural resources have been dedi cated to supporting such activity. While their violations of our intuitive 4 Anthropopsychicism is an admittedly ugly term that has fallen out of favor over the years (I stumbled upon it reading Romanes 1902). However, it can serve a useful purpose if we take it to mean something like "the ascription of human intentional agency to non-human agents." Boyer (1996) argues—responding to Guthrie (1993)—that if religious thought involves projecting human qualities to non-human agents, we nevertheless find a fairly specific "hierarchy of projections" in religious traditions. That is to say, the ascription of a folk psychological "theory</page><page sequence="10">250 MATTHEW DAY ontologies make religious concepts attention-grabbing, he believes that "they also make such ideas transient, difficult to comprehend and to transmit. In an evolutionary context they do not 'fit' into the domain specific cognitive domains, and in a developmental context they do not 'fit' into a domain of intuitive knowledge" (Mithen 1998b: 102). As a result of their intrinsically hybrid status, in other words, religious con cepts are always in danger of slipping between the mind's organiza tional cracks. His proposal is that the material artifacts we typically associate with religious traditions are in fact "cognitive anchors" that secure the long-term viability of such slippery concepts by explicitly representing them in enduring external media. Or, drawing on my own metaphor of choice, religious material artifacts are like flying buttresses, external architectural devices that bear the idiosyncratic computational thrust of religious cognition. From where Mithen stands, understand ing this practice of transferring counter-intuitive concepts onto durable external media is crucial for explaining religion because "although the cognitively fluid mind is very well suited to inventing supernatural beings with such features, it is not well suited to understanding, remember ing, and transmitting these religious ideas" (Mithen 1998b: 104). 3. Religious material culture: Good trick or forced move? If we assume that McCauley and Mithen speak for more or less identifiable constituencies , the cognitive science of religion would appear to have two different theoretical models of religious thought on the table. According to McCauley's team, religious cognition is both nat ural and easy. Spontaneously generated by cognitive routines and devices that are secured by evolution and normal psychological development, counter-intuitive religious concepts are about what we would expect to find in a mind like ours. From this perspective, "ordinary cognition plus exposure to an ordinary environment goes a long way toward explaining religion" (Barrett 2000: 29). In contrast, Mithen's squad takes religious cognition to be natural but surprisingly difficult given the mind's evolutionary history. To compensate for the computational chal lenges that are introduced when the gods appear on the scene, reli of mind" is more recurrent than the ascription of particular physiological traits. He writes: "Religious systems the world over include some projection of intentional psychology onto putative agents such as spirits or ancestors. Now, in very few of these cultural environments could one find specific assumptions about the physical similarity between spirits and humans" (Boyer 1996, 91-2).</page><page sequence="11">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION 251 gious traditions introduce material artifacts and props to scaffold our interactions with these supernatural agents. Religious cognition is thus an inescapably cultural process because, rather than floating free of cultural input, it loops out into the cultural world to exploit the local cache of human artifacts. The obvious question to ask at this point is: Which model is correct? It is too early in the game to make any definitive pronouncements about whether the "cognitive insiders" (McCauley) or "cognitive out siders" (Mithen) are right about the role of culture in generating and preserving religious thought and behavior. Nevertheless, the evidence does seem to support the insiders' basic contention that religious cog nition is both natural and relatively easy for a mind like ours. If the strategic use of explicit material representations was a requirement for interacting with or thinking about counter-intuitive agents in general, for example, we should expect to find a clear majority of children using material artifacts (e.g., dolls, stuffed animals, etc.) to similarly "anchor" their relationships with invisible imaginary companions. Yet, the mea ger data that exists suggest that this isn't the case. In a recent sum mary of their decade-long research program, psychologists Marjorie Taylor and Stephanie Carlson reveal that nearly two thirds of their subjects' imaginary companions were not associated with any kind of physical representation (Taylor and Carlson 2002). This piece of evi dence is important not because the gods are nothing more than imag inary companions, but because our ability to have complex "off-line" or "decoupled" relationships with agents who are not effectively dis criminable in the environment—a crucial cognitive skill for trafficking with the gods—is already well in place by middle childhood (see also Boyer 2001: 149-50). Yet, my gut theoretical instinct is that the out siders are on to something important (Day forthcoming). Over the last decade interest in models of embedded or situated cog nition has taken off within the cognitive sciences. To a first approxi mation, the guiding idea is that the standard cognitivist assumption that intelligent behavior can only be explained by appealing to internal infor mation-processing routines is a mistake. "The early researchers in cog nitive science placed a bet that the modularity of human cognition would be such that culture, context and history could be safely ignored at the outset and then integrated in later," Edwin Hutchins writes, "The bet did not pay off" (Hutchins 1995: 354). Rather than restrict ing the environment of thought to the cramped quarters between our ears, theorists of situated cognition draw attention to ways that our problem-solving behaviors are often intimately tied to features in the</page><page sequence="12">252 MATTHEW DAY surrounding, external environment. Anyone who has ever posted a note to themselves on the refrigerator about what to get at the supermar ket, or used a bookmark to indicate where to start reading the next time you pick up a book, is already familiar with the concept and the power of embedded cognition. The hypothesis is that when we do things like actively structure our environment in such a way that rel atively simple pattern-recognition tasks ("Start reading here") can be substituted for labor-intensive computational assignments ("Remember, start reading on the top of pg. 327"), we functionally extend and aug ment our native cognitive abilities by making the world part of our cognitive machinery. As Andy Clark trenchantly observes, "We use intelligence to structure our environment in such a way that we can succeed with less intelligence. Our brains make the world smart so that we can be dumb in peace" (Clark 1997: 180). If we examine religious systems through the lens of cultural and social embeddededness, the familiar range of religious artifacts begin to look like "mind tools" that allow us to transform a given computa tional task in ways that fit with the natural talents of the mind's design. As a case in point, it is incredibly tempting to view religious statues as socio-cognitive surrogates, identifiably physical stand-ins for the invisible gods and spirits of religious systems that put believers in a better posi tion to use their basic perceptual, motor, and social cognitive compe tences. However, if McCauley's team is correct about religious cognition being both natural and easy, these looks could be deceiving because our commerce with the gods already consists of doing what we're naturally good at doing (i.e., thinking about social interactions with intentional social agents)! As a result, theorists interested in importing the insights of sit uated cognition to the study of religion will have to be careful not to articulate an overly robust case for the functional role of material arti facts by mistaking mere statistical correlation for outright causation. That is to say, methodological safeguards should be in place to pre vent anyone from thinking that material artifacts must play a unique causal role in generating, maintaining and transmitting religious con cepts because the material cultures of religious traditions always seem to have these sorts of props laying around. On my reading, this kind of over-ambitious theoretical stance is what leads someone like Colin Renfrew to argue that "without artifacts, material goods, many forms of thought simply could not have developed. That is clearly true in the field of religious belief where the distinctions made between deities, for instance, are in part dependent upon the possibility of representing them" (Renfrew 1998: 2; italics added). Given the current batch of evi</page><page sequence="13">THE INS AND OUTS OF RELIGIOUS COGNITION 253 dence regarding the mind's information-processing capacities, this state ment seems too strong by half. If the perspective of embedded cognition is going to achieve lasting theoretical traction in the cognitive science of religion, I believe it will be along relatively modest lines. This means that its advocates will, in all likelihood, need to relinquish the high-octane thesis that "we trans form religious ideas into material form so that we can perform oper ations on them which are beyond the capacity of the mind" (Mithen 1997: 72). In its place, we should begin developing empirically sensi tive theories about how the creation, manipulation and transmission of religious artifacts are computationally valuable strategies but not cog nitive requirements for our commerce with the gods. That is to say, we ought to look on the use of material artifacts in religious systems as good tricks but not forced moves (Dennett 1996). My own as-yet-untested hunch is that religious props are "content-fixing elements" in religious cognition, an additional input class that exists alongside the traditional vehicles (narrative and ritual) for generating and transmitting religious knowledge (P. M. Churchland 1989, Clark 1996). Rather than allow ing us to think things we could not otherwise think, these elements of the "culturally constituted material environment" would provide a set of tools for prompting and manipulating our intuitive knowledge of the world. Although it is probably incorrect to argue that the eye-catching material cultures of religious systems determine the content of religious thought, they may nevertheless represent a form of cultural input that guides religious cognition by offering computational cues which dovetail with other forms of input. As I see it, one of the virtues of this approach is that it allows us to do justice to the data coming out of cognitive and developmental psychology while addressing someone like Harvey Whitehouse's concerns about the cultural contexts in which our cog nitive engines are fired. Am I on the right track? Only time and the heavy lifting of standard scientific inquiry will tell. In the meantime, however, I am content to sit with my conviction that there has to be a coherent explanation for the ornate material cultures of religious sys tems—and look forward to the day when an academic study of reli gion rejuvenated by the modern cognitive sciences has discovered it.
