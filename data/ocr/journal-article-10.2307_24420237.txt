A year or two later, a second statue representing the Nile River (Fig. 2), also from the sanctuary of Isis, entered the Vatican Statue Court, and soon after a third river god. The Tiber and Nile led to a clear understanding of the ancient type, the identification of other statues, and ultimately the tremendous popu larity in the sixteenth century of river gods in fountains, festivities and trium phal entries, political propaganda, and much more.2 This essay examines selected early steps in this development to demonstrate how the Renaissance appropriated the ancient river god through installations, restoration, and the reinvention of the figure type. Over the course of the sixteenth century, the understanding of nature also developed in new directions, in part inspired by ancient texts. Artists explored how the human body could represent the natural world, how anthropomorphisms, rivers given human form, could funcdon as personifications, figures who speak and act,3 and how the human body could embody the meaning imprinted on it.4 At the same time, patrons discovered the potential of river gods as vehicles for political messages about rule over territory. In particular, the Medici, especially Pope Leo X and later Duke Cosimo de' Medici, played important roles in some of the foundational stages of these investigations. 1 Hans Henrik Brummer, The Statue Court in the Vatican Belvedere (Stockholm: Almqvist 8c Wiksell, 1970), 191-2. 2 Ruth Rubinstein, 'The Renaissance Discovery of Antique River-God Personifications', in Scritti di storia dell'arte in onore di Roberto Salvini (Florence: Sansoni, 1984), 257-63; and Phyllis P.

Observers were struck with the size of the statues - larger than life, colossal, even twice life-size, one estimated.(&gt; The Hellenistic type is clear in these two statues: bearded old men with scraggly hair and garlands, powerful bodies semi-reclining witb the back leg raised and slightly bent and the front leg lying on the ground, the torso tilted toward the viewer and head turned away. Accounts of the statues noted the attributes, particularly the cornucopia, filled with fruits, bunches of grapes, and pine cones, to denote the abundance that the river brought to the territory through which it passed. The rivers were immediately identifiable by what they lean against - a she-wolf and Romulus and Remus for the Tiber, and for the Nile a sphinx, along with sixteen small putti, alluding to the height necessary to overflow and make the land fertile, a phenomenon that was of much scientific interest later in the century.' A drawing of the statue court in 1532-33 by the Dutch artist Marten van Heemskerck hints at the commanding presence of the two great river gods in the centre of the court, raised on massive plinths (Fig. 3).8 The intriguing '' Brummer, Statue Court, 191-204, 266-71. 7 Bober and Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists, 99, 102; and Rubinstein, 'Renaissance Discovery', 259.

The river gods faced each other, their bodies oriented in the same direction, as though in dialogue, the first of many such pairings through the century. The bases of the river gods are carved with rippling water, which Nicolas Beatrizet emphasized in prints of them. In his engraving, The Tiber, the back edge of the base is indicated at the right, but in the foreground Beatrizet continued the wavering lines to the edge of the sheet, suggestively transforming carved stone into a body of water (Fig. 4).9 The engraving playfully evokes the actual installation, since the Tiber and Nile really did lie on beds of water, as the great platforms were also basins.10 These beds were not still water, but moving, rippling, as in the engraving, from the streams emerging from these figures (or their bases) that Venetian ambassa dors saw in 1523,11 which associated the figures not just with the element of water, but with the idea of a river. The coat of arms on the monumental plinths, visible in Heemskerck's drawing, attributes to the Medici this novel linking of personihcation with natural element personified. Ancient statues could also be appropriated by giving them new identities, in some cases through restoration, as in another river god discovered in Rome in the early sixteenth century, which was transformed into the Arno, a type that did not exist in antiquity (Fig. 5). The statue is a composite, or integration, as the practice became known. The sixteenth-century restorer completed the statue with both a modern head and a right arm from another antique sculpture, and he also carved a Medici diamond ring around the rim of the 9 Michael Bury, The Print in Italy 1550-1620 (London: British Museum, 2001), 137-8. 10 Winner, 'Collocazione', 119. 11 Brummer, Statue Court, 195 and 266, 'da questi escono due bellissime fontane'.</page><page sequence="5">74 Claudia Lazzaro Fig. 5 The Arno/Tigris, Vatican, Vatican Museums (photo: Vanni/ Art Resource, NY) vase and inside it the face of a lion. The restxlt is a subtle but clever conceit: the river's water emerges from the mouth of a Florentine lion. (The current designation as the Tigris dates from a late eighteenth-century misreading of the lion's face.) The sixteenth-century head is unmistakably Michelange lesque in form and pathos, and a contemporary anecdote attributed to Mich elangelo himself the idea for the unusual knotted beard.13 In addition, Vasari credited its rustic setting in the Vatican to the Florentine sculptor. The date is uncertain, but one or the other Medici popes, Leo X or Clement VII, claimed the ancient statue as the Arno and as Florentine, with the stylistic 'signature' of Florence's most famous sculptor and with Medicean and Florentine emblems.14 Michelangelo's design for the installation of the restored statue in the Vatican, recorded in Heemskerck's sketch of the 1530s and more evocatively in a late eighteenth-century drawing by Anton Raphael Mengs, was another kind of integration, combining ancient and modern, art and nature (Fig. 6). The rough-hewn backdrop of the naturalistic setting Vasari described as made from cipollaccio in imitation of natural rocks.15 The green and yellowish marble with black and white flecks, cut into rough, irregular shapes, must have 12 Ruth Rubinstein, 'The Statue of the River God Tigris or Arno', in Cortile delle Statue, 275-85; and Brummer, Statue Court, 186-8. 13 Rubinstein, 'Statue', 277, 282. 14 Arnold Nesselrath, 'Il Cortile delle Statue: luogo e storia', in Cortile delle Statue, 10, dates the installation before Bramante's death in April 1514.

Vasari explained that this marble was found buried among ruins, and his comment about it is equally applicable to the entire installation, that from ancient things modern works were fashioned, and these could be very beautiful. The installation not only links the anthropomorphic statue with water, but presents the river god as like a river itself lying amongst the rocks of its surroundings. The water pouring into the sarcophagus that served as a basin and cascading over it into a pool below would have added sounds of running water to evoke the sensation of a river. Later, shorn of all but the sarcophagus, the statue also lost the Renais sance affirmation of it as an image of the natural world. In the Vatican Statue Court, the Arno in its rustic setting in the northwest corner complemented an ancient reclining female statue diagonally opposite, acquired by Pope Julius in 1512 and displayed in a similar natural rocky landscape (Fig. 7). Now known as Ariadne, in the sixteenth century the statue had two alternate identities, as Cleopatra, through a reading of her armband as a serpent and her body position as signifying death, and as a sleeping nymph, associated with a fresh water spring (the female counterpart of river gods), through her similarity with the recumbent pose of a popular Roman fountain type.16 The juxtaposition of related yet contrasting poses of the two ancient statues would have been meaningful to contemporaries. Both are semi-reclining, but the Arno conveys a sense of promptness, emphasized by the modern additions, with the body supported by the arm, the torso emphatically tilted toward the viewer, and the sixteenth-century head, which appears awake 16 Brummer, Statue Court, 154-84; and Leonard Barkan, Unearthing the Past: Archaeology and Aesthetics in the Making of Renaissance Culture (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), 233-43.</page><page sequence="7">76 Claudia Lazzaro u 7 , m: Fig. 7 Cleopatra/Sleeping Nymph (later Ariadne), Vatican, Vatican Museums (photo: Scala/ Art Resource, NY) and alert, turned purposefully to the side. Cleopatra, on the other hand, seems immobile, with legs intertwined, drapery wrapped and criss-crossed, and right arm flung over her inclined head with closed eyes. The Renaissance, inspired by the ancients, understood the natural world as gendered, different parts of it having a male or female identity, which was represented in sculpture with appropriately masculine or feminine poses and gestures.17 The setting of the Cleopatra/Sleeping Nymph, as we know it from Francisco de Holanda's drawing of 1538-39, refers to the story behind the popular statue type about a nymph sleeping in a cave to the murmuring sound of water (Fig. 8). The backdrop of striated rocks dripping water and fern-like vegetation evokes her woodland retreat, with again an ancient sarcophagus as a basin, giving the statue an identity unrelated to any that she had in antiquity. In his drawing, Holanda reinforced the association of the sleeping nymph with the spring that she personified, and also emphasized her femaleness, through subtle alterations to the statue. Fie inclined the figure toward the viewer, which enhanced the pose of abandon, and bared a second breast and more of her belly than in the ancient sculpture. Michelangelo's design for the Arno (Fig. 6), with its marble rocks, hard and masculine, and cascading water might be viewed similarly as reinforcing its designation as the (male) Tuscan river, whose source was in the Apennine Mountains north of Florence.

RIVER GODS IN LEONINE IMAGERY In the sixteenth century, river gods, inspired by the ancient statues, became obligatory in ceremonial entries and festivities and acquired new roles, as references to place, territories ruled, and alliances between states. The first such appearance occurred on the Capitoline Hill in Rome in September 1513 in the celebration organized by Pope Leo X soon after his election to com memorate the conferral of Roman citizenship on his brother Giuliano and his nephew Lorenzo de' Medici. The river gods Tiber and Arno featured both in paintings on the large temporary theatre and as characters in the spectacle,</page><page sequence="9">78 Claudia Lazzaro which introduced these images to a large audience at the event and in written descriptions. Both painted figures and living personifications borrowed their basic form from ancient sculpted prototypes - mostly nude and reclining, with white hair and beards to denote their age. The river gods, whether theatrical characters or images, stood for their respective geographical states through their association with symbols (Roman wolf and Florentine lion) and with personifications of the cities themselves. Together they presented the theme of the event - the unity of Rome and Florence. In the prelude to the comedy, the living river gods rise from their reclining positions to deliver brief and rambling speeches, which hint at future political uses.18 Another event a few years later again connected the pope with the image of river gods: in 1517 Leo X transferred to the Capitol a second pair of classical statues - a different Nile with a Tigris - both of which had stood on the Quirinal through the Middle Ages.19 Thesejoined other ancient sculptures that Pope Sixtus IV had donated to the Roman people in the late fifteenth century. We can imagine how the personifications might have appeared in the Capitoline festivities from their representation a couple of years later in the borders of the tapestries that Raphael designed for Leo X in 1515-16.20 (These were destined for the lower walls of the Sistine Chapel and were displayed from late 1519.) In contrast to the grandiose scenes from the Acts of the Apostles in Raphael's tapestry designs, the horizontal borders below depict events in the life of Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici until his election as pope, in a style that imitates ancient Roman relief sculpture in fictive bronze.21 Many of these pseudo-antique narrative scenes, with a progression of figures across a shallow space, entail the passage from one locale to another, among them Giovanni de' Medici riding from his investiture as cardinal at Fiesole toward Florence in the episode beneath The Stoning of Stephen (Fig. 9). At either side of the historical events are vignettes, little scenes representing various locations - Florence, Rome, Fiesole, and Mantua, designated through river gods as well as landscape features, architecture, and personifications of cities and at least one mountain. Ancient models inspired individual figures, among them the personification of Mantua in the form of the Vatican Cleopatra/Sleeping Nymph.22 The vignettes indicate place, help to identify the episodes, and visually serve as a framing device, with symmetrical or comple 18 Fabrizio Cruciani, II teatro del Campidoglio e le feste romane del 1513 (Milan: II Polifilo, 1968), LVII-LXIV, 7, 17, 26, 55, 57-9. 19 Peter Partner, Renaissance Rome 1500-1559: A Portrait of a Society (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 173. 20 John Shearman, Raphael's Cartoons in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen and the Tapestries for the Sistine Chapel (London: Phaidon, 1972), 3, 31, 37, 84, and Figs. 13, 17, 18, and 54.

Equally important, they bring the classical gods into proximity with Cardinal Giovanni. In his study of allegory, Gordon Teskey sees the role of the classical gods in the Renaissance as conferring legitimacy, through 'an aura of mysterious power', on the symbols of the state, most importantly, on the body of the prince.23 The tapestry borders exemplify an early form of this, in which allegorical and narrative modes remain fairly separate.24 Only the personified cities - female by tradition and according to linguistic gender - interact physically and emotionally with the historical scenes, as in the one beneath The Miraculous Draught of Fishes (Fig. 10). There the standing figure of Florence, who seems to emerge from the reclining Arno below her, extends her arm and points toward Cardinal Giovanni. Raphael's river gods embody rivers, lying against hills and mountains, bearing overflowing urns, and sitting above the bodies of water that they personify. Likewise, the vignette representing Fiesole includes both a mountain 23 Teskey, Allegory, 78-82, here 79. 24 Ibid, 85.</page><page sequence="11">80 Claudia Lazzaro Fig. 10 Pieter van Aelst after Raphael, The Miraculous Draught of Fishes Tapestry, detail of border, Vatican, Vatican Museums (photo: Musei Vaticani) and seated astride it, the bearded male personification of Mount Falterona (Fig. 9). The six river gods in the surviving tapestries purposefully evoke ancient statues, reliefs, and gems, but none is an imitation. Rather, they display Raphael's inventiveness in creating variations on the theme of the reclining river god type, among them some completely nude, one grasping an urn with both hands, and the Arno seen from the back, as the Vatican Tiberand Mfecould be viewed (see Fig. 10). Several represent the Arno, in diverse body types, poses, and attributes, once more inserting this river into the pantheon of river gods, and fixing the association of river deities with the body of Leo X. NATURE AND CAPRICE IN THE JUDGEMENT OF PARIS In Raphael's tapestry borders, the river gods serve as bookends of the stories, framing the narrative scenes, and as shorthand signifiers of place, indepen dent of the historical episodes, but related and useful in identifying them. They also function as overt all'antica elements alluding to statues that Pope Leo X integrated into the Vatican display. In Raphael's design for The Judge ment of Paris, engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi about 1517-20, an allegori cal representation of place with explicit classical references frames a familiar mythological story (Fig. II).25 The classical tale concerns Paris, the seated 25 For the engraving, see Wendy Stedman Sheard, Antiquity in the Renaissance (Northampton, Mass.: Smith College Museum of Art, 1978), cat. 90; and Innis H.

The large size, grandeur, and classical evocations announce the engraving's importance, but, as in the tapestry borders, the characters in the story fill no more than half the composition. The remaining space is taken up by the landscape setting with three nymphs at the left and a group of nymphs and two river gods at the right, famous from Manet's appropriation of them in his painting Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe of 1863. In his biography of Marcantonio, Vasari explained these figures as fantasies added 'per capriccio'.26 About a century later, the French art theorist, Roland Fréart de Chambray, found them 'but a poetic accompaniment from the painter's genius that enriches the effect of his picture'.27 While scholars have principally concerned themselves with the narrative and with Marcantonio's technical virtuosity, Hubert Damisch in his study of the theme of the Judgement of Paris attends to the capricious figures, the supplement or artistic premium that Raphael brought to his visual account of the myth, which contributed to the admiration of all Rome that Vasari reported.28 26 Giorgio Vasari, Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori, ed. Gaetano Milanesi (Florence: G. C. Sansoni, 1906), 5: 411. 27 Both Fréart and Vasari are cited by Hubert Damisch, The Judgment of Paris, trans.

He explained: 'for all these nymphs with their amphoras, and the two male figures holding reeds, seated and nude, paying no attention to what is happening, indicate nothing but that Mount Ida is abundantly provided with rivers and fountains.'29 They were not entirely Raphael's invention, however, as he modelled his composition on two ancient reliefs, one in the Villa Medici, the other in the Villa Pamphili.30 Raphael derived the number and general position of the personifications from their counterparts in each of the ancient reliefs, and, as in his sources, he integrated them into a sequence of varied poses and contrapposti across the picture space. Nevertheless, he transformed both the individual figures and their compositional role. For example, the model for the seated nymph at the left in the Pamphili relief is seen from the back and turned slightly to the side, while in Raphael's design she sits at an angle and leans forward into her projecting knee, but rotates her head in the opposite direction. In contrast to the two reliefs, Raphael more emphatically differentiates the personifications from the characters in the story and gives them a greater prominence and visual interest. Damisch underlines Fréart's observation that the nymphs and river gods turn their backs to the narrative scene, ignoring it. They do, however, look back into the landscape, out to the viewer, off to the side, and at each other. Through their poses and gazes, they extend the picture space in depth and beyond the frame, a figurai parallel to the naturalistic landscape around them. Because they have no story to tell, Raphael could exercise artistic license and create striking and novel figures and groups, which at the same time reveal a conception of the natural world as animate and alive. Fréart identified the rivers as the Xanthus in the foreground and behind him the Simois, both of which had their origins on Mount Ida. Their inter secting positions and overlapping attributes reflect the geographical reality, since the rivers join, as Fréart explained, 'after irrigating the Trojan country side along their respective beds', which reminds us of the fateful aftermath of this episode in the Trojan War.31 The Xanthus River is more youthful than his counterpart in the Villa Medici relief and in ancient statues. His youth, nudity, and fine physique perhaps convey the origins of the river on Mount Ida: the river is still young. Departing from the typical pose of the semi-reclining river god, Raphael instead borrows that of his own Heliodorus in the Vatican, with the front leg resting on the ground and the raised back leg supported by the foot, the two limbs alternately suggesting stasis and potential movement.32 Unlike his biblical model, however, the river god sinks back languorously, his torso turned toward the viewer to display his superb anatomy. In contrast to 29 Damisch, Judgment, 212, 214. 30 Both reliefs are illustrated in Bober and Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists, cats. 119 and 120. 31 Damisch, Judgment, 213. 32 Jones and Penny, Raphael, 179.</page><page sequence="14">Personifying nature in sixteenth-century Italy 83 the river god's open pose, his female counterpart, the androgynous seated nymph, is closed in on herself, elbow on raised knee, revealing only the long curve of her back. She shifts her head, however, to gaze directly out at the viewer. The multi-directional body positions conceived in space and the sug gestive and sensual poses exemplify the transformation of classical models in the sixteenth century as well as the Renaissance understanding of nature. The inscription on The Judgement of Paris vaunts the power of beauty over intellect, virtue, kingdoms, and wealth.33 This could be Paris speaking of his own choice of Venus and her promise of Helen of Troy, the most beautiful woman in the world. It is also Raphael and his amanuensis Marcantonio appealing to the judgement of the viewer and doing everything possible to move him or her with the beauty, sensuality, and nonchalance of all the figures. The aim, the inscription implies, is to arouse, not just through the figure of Venus, but with the whole, story and supplement equally. Why, then, does Minerva, goddess of wisdom, occupy the central position, more enticing than Venus with her rear view and the long curve of her nude body? Since river gods must have been closely associated with Leo X in the second decade of the sixteenth century from the ancient statues in the Vatican, the Capitoline ceremonies of 1515, the tapestry borders of 1515-16, and the transfer of two river gods to the Capitol in 1517, perhaps this idyllic scene could also be read as a reference to Leonine Rome as another garden paradise like Mount Ida. In the possessooï 11 April 1513 (the ceremony in which a newly elected pope takes possession of the Lateran, the papal basilica), temporary triumphal arches ornamented with classical gods marked the route. One of them included the inscription, 'Once Venus had her time, Once Mars had his. Now Pallas [Minerva] has her time'. Alluding to his predecessors, the lascivi ous Alexander VI and the bellicose Julius II, the inscription suggests that Pope Leo X's reign would be guided instead by Minerva's wisdom.34 Raphael did very well under Leo, and Rome may have seemed to him and to others a locus amoenus under the influence of the goddess. RIVERS AND BODIES OVERFLOWING A novel feature in Raphael's splendid river god is that, with no vase to overflow, water spurts instead from his own penis into a stream (Fig. 12). (Although possibly ambiguous in reproductions, the straight lines against a light ground emerging from the penis clearly do not belong to the system of shading where leg meets lower torso.) The familiar association of river gods with the fertility of the nearby land was traditionally designated by a 33 SORDENT PRAE FORMA INGENIUM VIRTUS REGNA AURUM, roughly translated: Intellect, virtue, kingdoms and gold appear worthless compared with beauty. 34 Olim habuit Cypris sua tempora, Tempora Mavors olim habuit, sua nunc tempora Pallas habet.

Raphael's image instead evokes a rich tradition that linked urine, semen, and water in everything from birth trays, large-scale oil paintings, and fountains with a pissing putto, to bawdy jokes, euphemisms, word plays, and puns, as Patricia Simons has recently demon strated. In one well-known example, Lorenzo Lotto's Venus and Cupid of the mid-1520s, Cupid urinates through a myrtle wreath onto Venus's torso, allud ing, in Simons' gloss, to 'fertilization, "watering", and ejaculatory desire'.35 The ubiquitous visual and verbal joking based on the interchange of liquids made the quintessentially masculine image of a penile emission - 'making water' or urinating available as an image of fertility, of a male river god both 'watering' and inseminating the surrounding land. The contemporary under standing of the processes of nature as analogous to human bodily and sexual functions is what ultimately made this image of the river god legible. While Raphael's Xanthus River reinforced the maleness of rivers as well as the abundance of nature, other personifications indicated femaleness through their poses. The historian of science, Katharine Park, discusses the significance of the change in the personification of nature from a 'majestic, clothed, and energetic' figure in the literature and art of the Middle Ages to a nude, lactating woman, or a many-breasted female figure borrowed from the ancient type of Diana of Ephesus. In contrast to the clothed medieval image of nature whose actions did not always conform to culturally feminine gender 35 Patricia Simons, 'Manliness and the Visual Semiotics of Bodily Fluids in Early Modern Culture', Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies, 32.2 (Spring 2009), 340-60, here 360.</page><page sequence="16">Personifying nature in sixteenth-century Italy 85 % Fig. 13 Giulio Romano, The Quest for the Golden Fleece, Mantua, Palazzo del Te, lunette in the Room of Psyche (photo: Scala/Art Resource, NY) roles, the Renaissance Natura was defined in exclusively female terms by 'the anatomical attribute of breasts and the physiological attribute of lactation'.36 Analogous to the water emerging from the river god's penis, milk spurts naturally and spontaneously from Natura's bare breasts. This figure celebrates a nature conceived as effortlessly bountiful, indeed a 'regime of plenty', which Park sees as an expression of Europe's prosperity, fed by the natural resources of the fertile New World.37 Both male and female images represent the over flowing abundance of nature in allusive and suggestive terms. Raphael's pupil Giulio Romano exceeded his teacher in devising an overt male counterpart to the lactating Natura in the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. The Room of Psyche, of about 1526-27, named after the story of Cupid and Psyche in the lunettes and vault, also celebrates love and pleasure in scenes of banquets and mythological couples. In one of the lunettes, story and frame, or artistic supplement as Damisch would have it, are inverted: a hoary river god dominates the scene, while in the right background a personified reed points toward Psyche, instructing her how to collect the golden fleece of sheep clinging to bushes (Fig. 13). Caricatured with bulging eyes and swollen belly, Giulio Romano's river god, positioned close to the picture plane, seems to tumble backward with spread legs into his rocky habitat.

At the same time this river god is an image of excess that speaks to the culture's concept of nature as abundance and spontaneous effusion, as well as its fascination with inexhaustible plenty, of commodities as well as natural resources.38 More locally, it slyly alludes to the relevance of water to Mantua, surrounded on three sides by artificial lakes formed by the Mincio River, which made the region rich in both commerce and agriculture.39 WATER IN THE GARDEN AT CASTELLO Sculpture, ancient along with modern, had long been displayed in gardens, but that in the Medici garden at Castello was unprecedented in incorporating all the personifications in Raphael's tapestry borders - mountains, rivers, and cities, distributed over space and integrated with the garden design. Duke Cosimo de' Medici's villa, a few miles northwest of Florence at the foothills of the Apennine Mountains, was celebrated in the sixteenth century for its abundant water, brought by aqueduct. The sculptor, architect, and hydraulic engineer, Niccolô Tribolo, designed the layout of the garden and its principal fountains from the spring of 1538, although several were completed only after his death in 1550.40 In the original design, now much altered but recorded in a painting by Giusto Utens of 1599 (Fig. 14), the principal garden at the centre was subdivided into three terraces with two retaining walls. For the niches in the upper wall supporting the bosco or wood, encrusted with a surface of stalactites culled from the mountains beyond, Tribolo planned, but never completed, sculpted fountains of two local mountains, the Asinaio (now known as the Senario) and the Falterona. For the lower wall, in similar rustic niches directly below those intended for the mountains, Tribolo carved statues in sandstone of two local rivers, the Mugnone and Arno. Vasari was taken with the resemblance to the geographical and hydrographie reality. As in the garden, Monte Senario lies to the west of Monte Falterona and these two mountains are respectively the source of the Mugnone and Arno Rivers, which meet at Florence, just as the water conduits were to pass from the sculpted mountains to the river gods, then onto a fountain in the lowest terrace representing the city.41 38 Ibid.] and see Richard A.

The colossal reclining Arno Vasari described as holding a vase against his thigh and leaning on a lion.4" The raised and considerably bent front leg that is visible in Utens' lunette resembles that of the river god in the title page to Bartoli's Opuscoli morali of 1568, a translation of various texts of Alberti (Fig. 15). Vasari par ticularly praised the much smaller Mugnone (4 braccia or 2.3 metres long), in reality only a tributary of the Arno. With one hand on the ground, the other supported a vase on his shoulder, and the left (front) leg crossed over the right.43 In the title page to Bartoli's 1550 translation of Alberti's treatise on architecture, based on a drawing by Vasari, the river god's legs assume the distinctive position of Tribolo's Mugnone (Fig. 16) .44 The pose recalls, but reverses, Michelangelo's Dusk and Day, in which the back leg is crossed over the front. Tribolo knew these figures well, as he worked on the Medici Chapel with Michelangelo and also made models of the Times of Day. In 1547, a river god representing the Arno was decreed the official emblem of the Florentine 42 Ibid. 6: 78.

Michelangelo also planned river gods for the Medici Chapel, for which he made a large-scale terracotta model of 1524-27 (Fig. 17). Since the terracotta figure remained in the Chapel when Michelan gelo left Florence and Tribolo later organized the statues strewn about, it surely inspired his own river gods, as it did many copies by other artists.4' In ancient statues such as the Arno, the back leg is raised and the torso tilted forward, so that the body is essentially contained in a single plane (Fig. 5). In both Michelangelo's reclining model and Tribolo's statues, as is evident even in the woodcut images, the lifted front leg results in a torsion within the body, with much greater potential for expressiveness and movement. These artists remade the image of the river god, translating the ancient statue type into a new Florentine aesthetic. The only one of Tribolo's sculptures at Castello to survive is the Fiesole, the personification of the hill town overlooking the Mugnone valley, which shared the river's niche, although in high relief rather than free-standing (Fig. 18). The contrapposto of her body is extreme, with leg facing one direction, head the opposite, projecting shoulder, twisted torso, and limbs extended back. Again the influence of Michelangelo is obvious, in the body's torsion as well as 47 Jeannine O'Grody, 'Michelangelo: The Master Modeler', in Bruce Boucher (ed.), Earth and Fire: Italian Terracotta Sculpture from Donatello to Canova (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001), 35-8.</page><page sequence="22">Personifying nature in sixteenth-century Italy 91 Fig. 18 Niccolô Tribolo, Fiesole, Florence, Bargello Museum (photo: Ralph Lieberman) in the resemblance to the master's unfinished sculptures. Tribolo must have begun with the Arno, progressed to the more adventuresome pair of Mugnone and Fiesole, and then turned to the mountains. Two terracotta figures in the Bargello attributed to Tribolo, identified alternately as rivers or mountains, may be prototypes for the unfinished statues. Both are in technically challeng ing, half-seated, half-crouching positions with hips off the ground, and with similar long beards and great urns (Fig. 19). Each body shifts multiple times in opposing directions, with no vestige of the planar, energetic with muscular tension. Contemporaries understood such bent bodies or figure sforzate (bodies bent so that they faced in different directions), influenced by Michelangelo's radical innovations and fashionable in sixteenth-century Florentine sculpture, as manifestations of artistic license.48 48 Michael Cole, 'The Figura Sforzata: Modeling, Power, and the Mannerist Body', Art History, 24.4 (September 2001), 526-33.</page><page sequence="23">92 Claudia Lazzaro u (Ed."*lle»ri) t: I.* *,• ITJlT. flfiENH-S.

Fig. 19 Niccolô Tribolo, Models for Rivers or Mountains, Florence, Museo Nazionale (photo: Alinari/ Art Resource, NY) Tribolo's personifications of rivers and mountains, far from empty displays of artistry, produced human bodies that conveyed the character of the entity they personified. The humanist Niccolö Martelli, who visited Castello in 1543, explained that the Mugnone had one foot over the other to denote that he had departed quite a bit from his old path (Fig. 16).49 The pose signified that the river had changed course over time, as in fact it did many times.50 Martelli also found the Mugnone colder and more austere than the Arno, but his austerity tempered by the softness of Fiesole (Fig. 18). The river god's angular limbs would have contrasted with her full thighs and round breasts, demonstrating contrasting male and female aspects of nature, and the city fertile and flour ishing through the nourishment of the river's waters. Another innovation in Tribolo's sculpted fountains, developing further the Vatican installations, is the integration of water with the statues' actions. Utens' lunette confirms Vasari's account that water poured from the vases of the river gods. The Monte Asinaio pressed his beard, as one of the terracotta models does, and water emerged from his mouth, perhaps running down the beard, to demonstrate that the mountain is a source of water.51 The replacement for Tribolo's unfinished mountains, a bronze statue of the Apennine Mountains by Bartolomeo Ammannati, was added to the pool at the 49 Niccolô Martelli, Dal primo e dal seconda libro delle lettere di Niccolô Martelli (Lanciano: R.

Hervé Brunon discusses various competing ideas in the sixteenth century about the origins of water, among them the Aristotelian understanding that cold permits subterranean air to transform itself into water.53 Ammannati's personification, shivering and dripping, performs the natural action of the mountain, producing water through the cold within its depths. At Castello, the fountains in sequence on the hillside replicate the passage of water in the Tuscan state; they also hint at a larger theme, the origins of water in the natural world, which was later fully developed in the Medici garden at Pratolino, as Brunon explains.54 Tribolo worked as a hydrau lic engineer for two Medici gardens and also for the Florentine state, but Vasari regretted that he wasted his time wanting to straighten rivers rather than making sculpture.55 His skill at hydraulics made the sequence of garden fountains possible, and his novel sculpted images reflect both his artistic skill and his practical understanding of the movement of water in nature. In the sixteenth century, river gods became vehicles for contemporary notions about natural science, artistic creativity, and political hegemony. Renaissance installations of the newly discovered ancient statues, along with the related Cleopatra/Sleeping Nymph, emphatically associated them with 52 Giorgio Galletti, 'Tribolo maestro delle acque dei giardini', in Elisabetta Pieri and Luigi Zangheri (eds.), Niccolà detto il Tribolo: Ira arte, architettura e paesaggio (Poggio a Caiano: Comune di Poggio a Caiano, 2001), 154, demonstrates that the water conduits were put in place under Tribolo. 53 Brunon, 'Mouvements des eaux', 39. 54 Ibid., 33-53. 55 Brunon, 'Da Castello a Pratolino: Buontalenti e l'eredità del Tribolo', in Niccolo detto il Tribolo, 168.</page><page sequence="25">94 Claudia Lazzaro nature, while none of the other antique sculptures in the Vatican were supple mented with fountains and naturalistic settings. The installations logically led to sculpted river god fountains, with the water integrated into the figure's action. Renaissance artists invented new river god types for local rivers, which allowed them to signify not just aspects of nature - gendered, animate, abun dant - but also particular places and together with other personifications of nature, a region in microcosm. They could confer legitimacy on a prince or demonstrate the effects of his good rule (in natural abundance, flood control, aqueduct construction, and so on) in triumphal entries, garden fountains, and much more. Ancient statues supplied a model for a powerful nude body in a reclining pose, but the variations and new types that soon appeared conveyed characteristics of a particular river - its course or relative age and size, or expressed graphically the idea of abundance in specifically male terms. Unlike characters charged with telling a story, river gods demonstrated artistic license, but artistic style was also inflected with place. Raphael's Xanthus River in the pose of his Heliodorus in the Vatican carried Roman associations, and Tribolo's were indisputably Florentine, following Michelangelo's artistic inno vations and his precedents in the Arno installation and the river god designs for the Medici Chapel. At the same time that the river god became ubiquitous in the sixteenth century, it was also intimately bound up with the image of Michelangelo, the Florentine Academy, the Medici, and Florence.
