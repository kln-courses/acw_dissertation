<plain_text><page sequence="1">Musings on Maulne: Problems and Parallels Naomi Miller Just beyond the village of Cruzy-le-Chatel, about twelve miles from Tonnerre and 120 miles southeast of Paris, a fortress-like structure looms above the plateau of this once forested Burgundian territory (Fig. 1). The Chateau of Maulne is all that remains of a much larger complex which, according to Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau, would have eventually included a gallery, corps-de-logis, and round court. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to explore Pierre Du Colombier's hypothesis that Serlio was architect of Maulne by probing into Serlio's ambience and the available sources for his designs,' and to examine the origin and nature of the formal elements of the chateau in view of the thought and temper of the times, the reign of Catherine de' Medici and the Religious Wars. History and Legend Two sixteenth-century sources constitute the principal con- temporary documents for the chateau- namely, the building contract and the description by Du Cerceau, accompanied by engravings (Fig. 2) and supplemented by drawings in the British Museum and in the Morgan Library (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Maulne is first cited in a contract dated 7 May 1566, drawn up between Antoine de Crussol, the Duc d'Uzes, and Jehan Verdot, mason from Tonnerre.2 The former was married to Louise de Clermont, the Countess of Tonnerre since 1556. It was in that very year that a fire destroyed much of the city, and at the time of the building of Maulne, the Hotel d'Uzes (Fig. 6) was being repaired in the Renaissance style for Louise, while even more sumptuous chateaux, such as nearby Tanlay, were being erected in Tonnerrois. Most likely, Maulne was located far from the Duc's own domain because of Louise de Clermont's family ties as well as her close friend- ship with Catherine de' Medici.3 Situated in the midst of an enormous forest renowned throughout the region as an excellent hunting preserve, the Chateau of Maulne was built directly over a source of water.4 The probability that an earlier chateau was on the site is supported by the contract, which stipulated that Verdot "faire et reconstruire la maison que ledit seigneur entend faire bastir en la forest de Maulne, sur la fontaine dudit lieu."5 "Fontaine" in this context apparently refers to the water source known as the Froide Fontaine -a perennial spring on a calcareous plateau, where most waters tend to be buried in a network of subterranean canals-probably the determining element of the sixteenth-century chateau.6 The Duc d'Uzes, like those before him in his desire for a seignorial dwelling, was obviously seduced by the forested terrain and the beautiful stone of Tonnerrois as well as the surrounding fertile plains and vineyards. Municipal archives mention a number of sojourns of the Duchess of Maulne, including one in the winter of 1569- 70. Prolonged stays are unlikely since Louise often travelled in the service of the court and as overseer of her vast holdings in the surround- ing territories. In the seventeenth century, the Clermonts preferred the family domain at Ancy-le-Franc, and Sylvestre's mid-century view reveals an already abandoned, albeit N.B.: A bibliography of frequently cited sources follows the footnotes. 1 The possibility of Serlio's connection with Maulne has previously been suggested by Pierre Du Colombier and Pierre d'Espezel, 211-18. While seek- ing the origins of the chateau, the authors noted affinities with the plans depicted in Serlio's book. I am immensely grateful to Peter Collins for his careful reading and editing of the original manuscript and the many suggestions that ensued. I should also like to thank Colin Eisler and Elizabeth MacDougall for their generous help in reading an earlier version, and Timothy Kitao for advice on Vignola problems. 2 Du Colombier, 214, gives the published source of this contract as Eugene Drot, "Recueil de Documents tires des Anciennes Minutes de Notaires deposees aux Archives departementales de l'Yonne," Bulletin des sciences historiques et naturelle de l'Yonne;" Auxerre, 1900, Jan.-June, 1899. The contract nowhere mentions the demolition of an old building. 3 See Hector de la Ferriere, Les deux cours de France et d'Angleterre, Paris, 1895, 8, 28. For Antoine de Crussol, see Gustave Teraube, Histoire d'Uzts, Valence, 1879, 20. 4 The most recent studies of Maulne are by Jean Fromageot and Albert Larcher. Fromageot, 779-782, cites the legend wherein the 16th-century build- ing was the last of a series of fortified chateaux on the particular site. This conforms to the local tradition of a military feudal aristocracy also responsible for the transformation of Tanlay from an austere fortress, as well as the building of Ancy-le-Franc. An 11th-century citadel may have existed on the territory of Maulne and by the late 13th century, Marguerite de Bourbon, the founder of the hospital of Tonnerre, is recorded to have visited another fortress here. Documents supposedly testify to the presence of a chateau dating from 1406-the work of Louis de Chalon, nephew of Marguerite. To my knowledge, no description has been found of this structure, soon after destroyed by Burgundian conquests. Cf. Du Colombier, 3, who also notes the absence of archaeological or documentary evi- dence for an earlier chateau at the time of construction. 5 ,. .* . To make and reconstruct the house that the said seigneur ordered built in the forest of Maulne, on the source of the said place." According to Du Colombier, L'Art renaissance en France, Paris, 1945, 44-45, Maulne, planned as a "rendez-vous de la chase," was designed around a fountain. Contradictory ideas exist, however, e.g., in Du Cerceau's description of Maulne as "lieu" rather than as "corps-de-logis"; Wolfgang Lotz, 45, 92, n. 18, believes that the chateau's function as a dwelling place is deempha- sized. This is also affirmed by Albrecht Haupt, Baukunst der Renaissance in Frankreich und Deutschland, Berlin, 1923, 124, who asserts that Maulne was built in the form of a citadel owing to the Religious Wars. "Lieu" of course may simply be the geographical term indicating the domain of Maulne under the jurisdiction of the nearest village. 6 See Fromageot, 780. Cf. another source near Maulne discussed by M. Christol, "Le puits de la Margelle," Bulletin de la socie'te' d'archiologie et d'histoire du Tonnerrois, xvI, 1963, 19- 20. This well, dating back to ancient Gaul, supplied the city of Vertillium with water for sumptuous baths and domestic needs, as well as in times of siege. See too Marcel Meunier, "Nos rivieres, nos ruisseaux et nos sources," Pays de Bourgogne, LXVIII, 1970, 86-89, concerning hydrographic studies of the area now in progress, includ- ing water courses and sources. Cf. D. Diderot, Encyclop&amp;die ou dictionnaire raisonne' des sciences, des arts et des mttiers, Paris, 1767, vII, 81ff., article on fontaines. The differ- ence between a fontaine and a source is given as follows: Source is used with reference to those natural canals that serve as subterranean conduits for waters situated at some depth, whereas fontaine indicates a basin at the surface of the earth, which pours out what it receives from the sources. Both are distinguished from artificial and architectural fountains.</page><page sequence="2">THE CHATEAU OF MAULNE 197 1 Chateau of Maulne.

How easy to imagine Maulne as an exclusive fortress; how odd to think of this almost pretentious farmhouse as a maison de plaisance or a fashionable hunting lodge! Du Cerceau's Description of Maulne Du Cerceau's account of Maulne and his accompanying en- gravings in Les plus excellents batiments de France of 1576 provide the earliest known description of the chateau. Al- though Du Cerceau's volumes are a prime source for our knowledge of sixteenth-century architecture, his qualified reliability in depicting incomplete buildings has been noted, as have his occasional inventive additions of ornament or de- tail. All subsequent hypotheses allude to this published source, whose complete text is translated below: This building is situated in the forest of Maulne, in Bur- gundy, two leagues away from Ancy-le-Franc. Built by the late Duc d'Uzes, the plan of this place is pentagonal, the comers of which are viewed on the exterior as five pedestal-like piers ascending from the base to the height of the entablature. The whole is but a mass having in its center and middle a fountain below in the form of a well, and around this a staircase pierced with openings, from which there is access to the parts: in such a way that ascend- ing and descending, one always sees the fountain at the bottom. In this building, there are stoves, boilers, baths, very cleverly placed, because of the fountain: altogether there are a reception hall, chambers, service rooms, and all commodities necessary for a dwelling, each floor equipped with what is needed there. The roof is pitched, and above is an open lantern, covered by a dome: about which are pyramids, serving as conduits to the fireplaces. Regarding the carpentry of the members, it is placed in an entirely different manner than is customary. For instead of a room where there is usually a beam and two bays, there are in these rooms four beams, carrying the comers, in the middle of the walls of the room: in such a manner that in the middle of the floor is a square, with four triangles at the four comers of the said floor. In the other rooms, there are in the same manner four transversal beams crossing each other, which make several frames, some square, the others paral- lelograms, and all the said squares in the ceiling. As for the hall, the beams are placed as in bays: but instead of these, there are other crossing and dominating beams (some cut into the others) the length of the hall, at three or four feet from the walls: in such a way that by this manner of placement of the beams several frames are found of diverse sizes enriched by moldings, in the manner of parquets. In one of the corners of this building is the drawbridge, from which one goes to a gallery opened below by arches, and by garrets above: and from here to a round court in the manner of a theater, where the offices are built. At the other end of the bridge, one goes out from the above- mentioned logis on to a garden which has at its entrance a fountain, to which one descends by some steps: this fountain is [from] the same spring as that of the chateau. Around this place you have still the beginnings of forts, built according to the drawing of the plan which I have illustrated. What is more, all that is excellent and re- markable in the building is easily recognized, as much from this plan as in the elevation.8 As for Du Cerceau's illustrations for this particular chateau, it is not unlikely that they were made directly from the un- known architect's plans or after designs executed in situ by another draftsman. In comparison to the number of engravings in Du Cerceau's work given to the contemporary Verneuil and Charleval, the one plate devoted to Maulne at the end of the first volume of Les plus excellents batiments de France almost seems like an afterthought (Fig. 2). The chateau and the gardens are treated in an extremely summary manner and the plate in general appears to be more schematic than most of his designs. In addition, the usual perspective view is missing, the elevation retaining the geometry of the plan.9 Although Maulne's precincts are clearly marked by enclos- ing walls, trenches, and galleries on Du Cerceau's plans, the site is dominated by the five-sided chateau. The promi- nence of segmented circular and oval forms in Du Cer- ceau's complex ties the plan to the grandiose schemes (e.g., the Tuileries, Verneuil, Charleval, and the enlargement of Chenonceau) initiated by Catherine de' Medici and Charles IX in the sixties and seventies-as also to the myriad fanciful and ideal plans by Du Cerceau.'o Its walled aspect as a forti- fied castle with a central keep, vestigial towers, and turret stairs is closer to those of Chambord, earlier Chenonceau, and Fontainebleau. Most astonishing on Du Cerceau's plan is the odd juxtaposition of geometrical shapes: the strong foci indicated by the elliptical forecourt, the truncated circular 7 Fromageot, 886- 87. Ownership passed to the Louvois, the family of a min- ister of Louis XIV, and the chateau's function was restricted to hunting parties. The cornice with the frieze of stag and lion heads may date from this time since no mention of it appears in Du Cerceau's account. In 1787 the French nobility installed a glass-works with royal privileges in the common property, which remained in situ until the Valery took posses- sion of Maulne around 1850. Minimal geographical and historical data concerning Maulne are given in M. Max Quantin, Dictionnaire topographique du dipartement de l'Yonne, Paris, 1862, 80. 8 Author's translation of fols. 62, 63 of Du Cerceau, See Appendix for original text. The role of Du Cerceau as architect is still in question in view of exist- ing concrete evidence. Rosalys Coope, Salomon De Brosse and the Development of the Classical Style in French Architecture, London, 1972, does not hesitate to take his alleged architectural designs seriously; Chap. II, esp. 21-22. Cf. Naomi Miller, "A Volume of Architectural Drawings ascribed to Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau the Elder, in the Morgan Library," Marsyas, xi, 1962-64, 33-46. 9 Carlo Pedretti, 5, compares Du Cerceau's bird's-eye views of the chateaux and parks with the late pen and ink drawings of Leonardo, noting "hardly any precedent" for the former. I think the stylistic com- parison is pursued too far. 10 Cf. Haupt, Baukunst der Renaissance, 113, who places Maulne in the category of ideal plans based on axial geometric fantasies. See too Louis Haute- coeur, Histoire de l'architecture classique en France, Paris, 1943, I, 350-51, where Maulne is cited as a combination of diverse geometric figures. Although noting the possibility of Serlio as architect, Hautecoeur also raises the question of similar plans in France, e.g., Du Cerceau's work in Petits temples, a valid comparison only in terms of symmetry.</page><page sequence="4">THE CHATEAU OF MAULNE 199 moat, and the hemispherical form at the terminus of the geo- metric divisions of the garden parterres- all distributed along a median axis that recalls the axial design of urban villas in Rome like the Belvedere and the Villa Giulia. The obsession with regular forms reaches its climax in the pentagonal chateau, which rises near the center of the complex (Fig. 5). As indicated by Du Cerceau, the chateau is built directly over a natural source of water at its very core; this element con- trols the symmetry of the plan. Du Cerceau's description of the unusual carpentry of the interior suggests that the preoccupation with geometry was manifest even in the details of the construction: the struc- tural system is used as an integral part of the play with geo- metric forms. The placing of the beams in such ornamental lozenges indicates clearly that it is a constituent of the archi- tectural design as well as characteristic of local carpentry (Fig. 8)."11 Aside from the reminiscences of the use of wood in earlier stone fortresses and the sixteenth-century concern with ornamental designs of carpentry (and the coffered ceilings of Ancy-le-Franc and Fontainebleau),12 there does appear to be a tradition of wood-framed buildings in Tonnerre. For example, the hugh vault of the thirteenth-century Old Hos- pital is sustained by oak beams from the forest of Maulne in an intricate and harmonious pattern. Indeed, after this com- plex and rational tour of symmetry, it is almost startling to discover the contradictions and peculiar irregularities of the fagade of the chateau. Within the five-comered structure of the chateau with its triangular bastions and its surrounding moat is a well. On the perspective view is an inscription that reads: "Le chasteau en plan de pantagone au milieu duquel est une fontaine en tour laquelles est I'escalier" (Fig. 3). This fountain, an in- digenous component of the chateau, is comparable to a gigan- tic cistern, placed at the nucleus of an impressive circular staircase seven stories high-and judging from Du Cerceau's description, it was the single most important architectural determinant in the plan: ". . . There are stoves, boilers, baths, very cleverly placed because of the fountain. .. ." The fountain is in the center of the pentagonal "fortress" when seen within the entire complex; it is on the central axis, literally at the heart of the chateau.'3 Another fountain appears on the garden side and is noted on the plan as follows (Fig. 4): ". . . il fault descendre du jardin ses degres pour aller ' la fontaine." The basin (or nymphaeum) here described is, according to Du Cerceau, fed by the same subterranean source as the fountain within the chateau. 14 The Chateau Today In view of the current sad reality of Maulne, it is difficult to verify Du Cerceau's illustrations. Still, enough remains to hypothesize as to the actual state of completion of the original chateau. At the time of its restoration, the forecourt was marked by great piles of oak logs stacked neatly on the stony terrain overgrown with brushwood and weeds (Fig. 9). Excavations have thus far failed to disclose the existence of bastions and surrounding walls, or the foundations and canal- ization of the sixteenth-century gardens. As local investigators point out, it is difficult to ascertain the original state of moats long since filled and fortifications that may never have been completed. Visible in an air view, a ruin of what once con- stituted the segmental arc housing the offices greets us on the path leading to the chateau proper (Figs. 10, 11, 12). Re- cently the arc has served as a depot for hay or straw. One could see sections of the building and such architectural embellish- ments as fireplaces in a cursory exploration of the main chateau. Such interior spaces as the stoves, boilers, and baths remained extremely difficult to approach and there was more actual danger in trespassing than the posted warnings declared. Efforts at restoration began in 1965 and narrow winding turret staircases permitted workers to repair the various levels.'5 Access to the chateau's well is via the staircase that rises the entire height of the building to the lantern; the lantern is a truncated conical shape, the diameter of which increases gradually until it reaches the summit.16 Revolving about a tower cage, three meters broad, the staircase ascends in a spiral (Fig. 13), pierced with openings and sustained by Doric columns (the columns are indicated on a plan in a volume of drawings ascribed to Du Cerceau in the Morgan Library; Fig. 5). Thus the well can be seen from any point from the five stories of the chateau, while the stairs provide entry to the arms of the building (Fig. 14).17 The stairwell may have been used as a central gathering place for guests with the "foun- tain" as a focal point. Water is channelled from the chateau via a superbly cut rusticated arcade, flanked with niches and bull's eye porticos. Hence a watering place is formed at the site of the nymphaeum and basin. At present this pool is slightly off the main axis, perhaps because of its prolonged usage as a n See Larcher, 8, who also concedes the difficulties in interpreting Du Cerceau's descriptions of the ceilings and vaults. 12 See Sebastiano Serlio, L'Architettura, Bk. vII, Frankfurt, 1576. 13 The central fountain might evoke the ancient impluvium as noted in Pompeian houses and described by Vitruvius, The Ten Books of Architec- ture, ed. M. H. Morgan, New York, 1960, vi, iii, 2. See too the description of a regard in Viollet-le-Duc, Dictionnaire raisonne de l'architecture franqaise du XIe au XVIe siecle, Paris, 1875, V, 530 (under Fontaine). 14 See Du Colombier, 212-13; and Emile Picq. An abundant source found in the upper garden originates in the underground parts of the chateau; the deep pit (still extant) now supplies a scant amount of water. During the construction of the chateau with which Du Cerceau is con- cerned, this fountain formed a basin whose circumference was relatively large. 15 Perhaps because of its present neglected state, its private ownership, or its relatively inaccessibility, Maulne has not been the subject of scholarly tracts. This promises to be altered, however, since an extensive restoration has been undertaken by the Soci6te des Amis de Maulne, a group of architects and their friends who acquired the chateau in 1958. Their aim is the establishment of a cultural center of the Burgundian Renaissance at Maulne. I thank Philippe Vallery-Radot, the President of the Society, for generously supplying me with first-hand information pertaining to recent work. 16 Cf. Picq, passim. 17 See Du Colombier, 213. In a letter dated 18 November 1966 Vallery- Radot suggests a utilitarian function for the architectural structure center- ing about the well. Because the Duchess d'Uzes was extremely enamored of her comfort, the construction of the staircase about the well made possible the availability of running water to all the floors, while at the same time providing a form of central heating. For example, the conduits to the fireplaces may have had a connection to the well and thus may have produced steam in some way. But lacking both documents to affirm this or sections of the chateau to demonstrate the means whereby the water was conducted or vaporized to provide steam, the somewhat intriguing as- sertion of Vallery-Radot must remain conjecture.</page><page sequence="5">200 THE ART BULLETIN YIIL ir1~ um Re??etCJ,!

Traces of a conduit have been found on the garden site, though Sylvestre's design gives the water an impression of unwarranted abundance- as if this was a canal or river rather than a foun- tain pool (Fig. 7). Details on the exterior differ from Du Cerceau's representa- tions-for example, the dome is presently without the lan- tern or four flanking pyramids, and a number of pediments crowning the towers have disappeared. Even the surface of stonework and stucco shows erosion. Recent architectural drawings hardly clarify the problems.18 The levels of the elevation in particular are difficult to read (Fig. 15). But then the plan of the level above the nymphaeum (Fig. 16) conforms to the south-north section and the stairs testify to different levels within the chateau. The asymmetry of the section has two possible explanations. Strange areas visible in the plan such as the thick walls and the truncated arcs suggest that a provincial architect was using the so- phisticated vocabulary of the day in a crude manner. On the other hand, they may be the work of a twentieth-century architect who superimposed the concrete forms of our time on an incomprehensible sixteenth-century framework. Current drawings of the plan at the level of the nymphaeum (Fig. 17) and the accompanying stairs (Fig. 18) are in line with the descriptions of Du Cerceau. A plentiful water supply is not easy to imagine in this now dry plain. But if water appears to be lacking in Maulne, abun- dant sources are still evident throughout Tonnerre. One of the city's most intriguing sights is the Fosse Dionne, a circular water basin surrounded by an open shed of wood and stone, usually ascribed to the sixteenth century (Fig. 19). Here associations with the Fountain of Arethusa in Syracuse are al- most more compelling than with the nymphaeum at Maulne. 18 I am indebted to Robert Vassas, chief architect of the Monuments his- toriques, Paris, for furnishing me with copies of recent drawings of the chateau. Figures 15, 16, 17, and 18 are, in turn, copied from these plans and elevation. Cf. Larcher, 12- 13. The present reconstruction should shed light on the pre-existing water level, the canalization beneath the supposedly once ex- tant gardens that would lead water from the source to the valley.

Considered as an entity, the five-sided structure, like the drawbridge and the gallery over the moat, the shape of the enclosed inner court and the stairwell within, have been compared to Peruzzi's and Antonio da Sangallo's proj- ect for a pentagonal fortress at Caprarola, dated ca. 1520- 25 (Figs. 21, 22).20 On the foundation of :he Rocca di Caprarola, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1559 built the luxurious 19 See Albert Larcher, Tonnerre et ses environs, Paris, n.d. 20 See especially Maria Casotti, I, 71-78 and 156- 160; and II, fig. 134. On 72, Casotti notes that the original plan may be attributed to Sangallo, ca. 1515, in collaboration with Peruzzi. Casotti's opinion is derived from Gustavo Giovannoni, Saggi sulla architettura italiana del Rinascimento, Milan, 1935, 241- 244; and Lotz, 75. See also G. Gicvannoni, Antonio da Sangallo il Giovane, I, 266-69. Cf. attribution to Vignola by Vasari, Le vite, ed. G.

The relationship between the plans of Caprarola and Maulne has been cited by Du Colombier, L'Art renaissance en France, 32. Lotz, 45-46, also notes the similarity with Vignola's first project for Caprarola, and he sug- gest trhat Vignona in the course of his stay in France in 1540 may have seen a plan of Maulne. But he somewhat modifies the hypothesis in note 20, where he raises the possibility of Vignola's role in the plans, a proposal he does not pursue because of lack of evidence.</page><page sequence="7">202 THE ART BULLETIN ?/ ':| ',? ,.1 : .., C. `:;t:!! .? _' _ .. _: - " .; . lC, &lt; . ?

Tonnerre (photo: Combier Imprimeur Magon) 20 Canal of Tonnerre (photo: author) country villa we see today. There are of course obvious dis- crepancies between the two buildings, such as the enormous difference in size and in the disposition of architectural ele- ments between Caprarola and Maulne (the former was a rural retreat whose plan revolves about an open central court and the latter was a hunting lodge or fortress built around a fountain). But there are cogent relationships between them. The analogy becomes even more significant in view of the underground level of the cistern of Caprarola, to which entry for carriages and horses is provided by means of a portal at a lower level of the terraced slope. Most authors have at- tributed this subterranean design to Vignola (Fig. 23).21 Fur- ther comparison is suggested by the passage in Du Cerceau's description of Maulne that refers to the placement of serv- ices: the ". .. poelle, estuves, bagnoires, fort bien pratiquees, a cause de la fontaine . . ." and the description of the lower level of Caprarola as recorded in the report of a voyage of Gregory XIII in 1578: ". . . le stanze da basso sotto il cortile, ove sono le cucine, le dispense et li tinelli, il forno, il molino et altro. . ."22 In any case, there is a comparable fortress arrangement with "offices" and water supply below ground. Both edifices thus provide for kitchens and stoves, clearly indicating that the cistern at Caprarola is neither ex- clusively for horses nor for guests who merely alighted from their carriages. Moreover, according to Vasari's account, a drawbridge was also a feature of the Famese villa: "La quale [fabbrica] . . . oltre all'avere forma e sito di fortezza e accompagnata di fuori da una scala ovata da fossi intorno e da ponti levatoi. ."23 The mythic Maulne is even closer to Caprarola--its chambers, after-hunt orgies, and courtly yet joyous atmosphere far from the constraints of town.24 Many of these features share a common vocabulary then in vogue, but their simultaneous existence is meaningful. Furthermore, innumerable irregularities are present at Maulne -both in plan and elevation-that make the building al- most a paradigm of Mannerist architecture at a time when Italian structures show an increasing regularity and orthodoxy in the use of Classical vocabulary.25 Several aspects are at odds with the rigid geometry of the chateau's plan and are definitely un-Italian-e.g., the illogical arrangement of the 21 Casotti, I, 157; 11, fig. 135. Vignola gives his definitive plan of the ground floor in a letter of 31 May 1559 (Fig. 24), although Casotti also cites Vignola's letter to Cardinal Famese, dated July, 1562, referring to the pavement of the circular corridor around the cistern. See Lotz, 38-39. Cf. too Casotti, I, 157-58; and Giovannoni, Saggi sulla architettura, 242-43 (fig. 3), where according to the document of 1559 cited above, the plan of Caprarola is sketched by Vignola with indications of the work to date. On 244, Giovannoni notes that the foundation walls and the subterranean level (following sketches of Sangallo and Peruzzi) already existed. Hence the dates converge, and Vignola's design is essentially a de- velopment of that of Sangallo and Peruzzi. 22 Casotti, I, 157-58: ". . . Stoves, boilers and baths very cleverly placed because of the fountain"; and ".. the rooms downstairs beneath the cortile, where [there] are the kitchens, pantries, and the servants' halls, the oven, the mill and other. . ." 23 Vasari, Le vite, vii, 109-110 ("The villa, which is approached by steps of an oval shape, holds the position, and has the form of a fortress; it is surrounded by a ditch and drawbridge of original invention and new form . . . trans.

Some of these elements such as the asymmetrically displaced windows may be seen in the region, as in the building alongside the eminent Hotel d'Uzes (Fig. 26). Other aspects of Maulne-the tower stair- cases, stucco, and brickwork-also testify to a strongly en- trenched vernacular style. In the light of such peculiarly French details as the unarticulated fagade, the steeply pitched roof, the turreted stairwells, and the general irregularities in proportions and particulars, it becomes even more dif- ficult to think of the chateau in the same terms as the com- plex of Caprarola. We arrive at a fundamental problem of French mid-century architecture: the degree of influence from the Italian High Renaissance. No architect is mentioned in the contract. As Du Colombier notes, Verdot's role was undoubtedly confined</page><page sequence="10">THE CHATEAU OF MAULNE 205 to the execution, rather than the creation of the chateau.26 This raises a number of questions, such as the nature of archi- tectural practices in the French Renaissance, the possibility of party loyalties, the procedure in drawing up contracts, and the proliferation of architectural treatises and pattern books. Sebastiano Serlio played a crucial role in the dissemination of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance in France, but as the author of several books on architecture rather than as an archi- tect. From his appointment in 1541 as "paintre et archi- tecteur ordinaire au fait de nosdits edifices et bastimens audit Fontainebleau,"27 until his death ca. 1554, only two buildings are ascribed to him: "Le Grand Ferrare" at Fontainebleau, and Ancy-le-Franc. Begun ca. 1546, Ancy was built for Antoine III de Clermont, the brother-in-law of the Duc d'Uzes, the patron of Maulne.28 Because of the relationship between the two families and the fact that Ancy is but five miles from Maulne, it is possible to consider Serlio as the designer of Maulne. This is just what Du Colombier proposed, despite the fact that the chateau was begun about twelve years after Serlio's death. Finding this a major drawback in the attribution, Du Colombier reasons that Serlio's projects may have been accessible to Louise de Clermont via her brother's architect.29 As interpreted by Du Cerceau, the abrupt termination of the pavilion's enclosing circular arcade at the three-quarter mark might indicate another alteration during or after the orig- inal design, rather than incompletion, or a certain casualness, which would have been atypical of the royal architect. It is as if Du Cerceau was arrested in the process wherein a circle became an ellipse, as demonstrated in Serlio's first book of architecture.30 Perhaps the formal garden was a later addition inspired by a whim of the patron (very likely following the example of her friend, Catherine de' Medici), for the encircling wall is crudely truncated (particularly noticeable in the plan; Fig. 4)-an "error" that is somewhat corrected in Du Cerceau's engraving, and the garden is quite awkwardly inserted. Louise may thus have marred the regularity of the original plan for the loggia, which should have formed a complete circle; the curved walk at the end of the garden is but a feeble attempt to restore symmetry. Here may be another demonstration of an Italian architect's flexibility in adapting to the tastes of his French patrons, a demonstration like Serlio's in the court fagades at Ancy. Both in Maulne and in Ancy there is a diminution of Italian elements in favor of French concepts such as the pitched roof, dormers, and linear pat- terns of the fagades-though the comparison should not be pursued much further. Blunt's description of the transposi- tion of Ancy from an Italian castello to a building "almost effeminate in its delicacy" may be applied to the essential relationship between Caprarola and Maulne.31 It is possible to imagine Peruzzi's ideas being transmitted to France through Serlio, his devoted pupil and proponent. In fact, Serlio's acknowledgment of his great debt to Peruzzi appears both in the Fourth Book on Orders, which was pre- sented to Francis I in 1537,32 and on the frontispiece of the Columbia manuscript.33 In 1540 Serlio dedicated his Third Book to Francis I, expressing his desire to study the antiquities of France. Serlio's northern Italian preference for picturesque effects is in accord with the taste propagated by the School of Fontainebleau, but in his feeling for mass he remains firmly rooted in the art of the Italian High Renaissance. Meanwhile, his books on architecture provided a valuable source for Renaissance building. Serlio wrote for the practising archi- tect, who in all probability used the book as a handbook or as a catalogue to be presented to his patron.34 As an archi- tectural draftsman, Du Cerceau may well have consulted Ser- lio's drawings rather than the buildings themselves. Further connections may be postulated between Serlio's plans and those for Mau!ne. As Du Colombier points out, the Munich manuscript for the Sixth Book (probably to be dated ca. 1546-53) contains two projects for pentagonal 26 Du Colombier, 216. 27 Leon de Laborde, Les comptes des batiments du Roi (1528-1571), 2 vols., Paris, 1877, I, 172-73. 28 See William Dinsmoor, 146, for the passage from the Sixt&amp; Book (in the unpublished Columbia University manuscript) giving Serlio's own tes- timony that he is the architect of Ancy. See Figs. 14- 19 for the draw- ings of the north front and section of the court as they appear in the Columbia and Munich Mss and the engravings of Du Cerceau. Cf. Anthony Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 1500-1700, London, 1957, 42-43, figs. 5, 6; and Du Colombier, 218. See too Francis Yates, The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century, London, 1947, 136, who notes the possibility of Anet's link with Ancy, since the Comte de Clermont Tonnerre was also the brother-in-law of Diane de Poitiers. This relation- ship is alluded to in the dc&amp;or of various parts of Ancy. 29 Du Colombier, 217- 18-i.e., Louise may have demanded one of Antoine's plans to be executed at a later date. This is not unlikely since the probable alterations in the construction of the original design may well be due to the lack of a supervisory architect. 30 See Johann Heinrich Miiller, "Das regulierte Oval, Zu dem Oval- konstruktionem in Primo Libro di Architettura des Sebastiano Serlio, ihrem architecktur-theoretischen Hintergrund und ihrer Bedeutung flir die Ovalbau-Praxis von ca. 1520 bis 1640," Ph.D. diss., Bremen, 1967, 53- 54, on the method of constructing ovals (see pl. 13b). 31 Blunt, Art and Architecture, 43. 32 Serlio, Il quarto libro (Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva), ed.

Much in it indicates a familiarity with that art associated with the School of Fontainebleau. At present, however, there are no records of Serlio's presence there prior to its publication date in Venice in 1537. 33 The Columbia manuscript devoted to domestic architecture contains nu- merous elevations and plans. Note especially pl. 32-Paviglione al costume di Franza (pianta della grotte segnarey y). Geometric shapes (circles, ovals, hexagons, etc.) of equal mass dominate the plan.

For example, the pentagonal structure at the center of Serlio's House for a Tyrannical Prince in the Columbia manuscript (prepared for Francis I) is a fountain or cistern (Fig. 27).36 If the date of the Fortified House is ca. 1546, as suggested by Dinsmoor,37 then this drawing may be related to the Peruzzi-Sangallo sketch for Caprarola (Fig. 21). Here is a similar division of spatial elements: a circular form- possibly a fountain--at the very center of the columnar court, and the placement of stairs directly inside the portal across a drawbridge." Serlio's drawing evidently derives from Peruzzi's sketch for Caprarola, which is to be dated before 1534. The Maulne plan differs from both the Serlio manu- script and the Caprarola design in that the approach (portal) is at one of the vertices of the pentagon-a logical ar- rangement considering that Maulne has one garden in opposi- tion to the two at Caprarola. Also, despite the close con- nections with Serlio, un-Serlian details appear in Maulne, notably such Gallicisms as the verticality and the emphasis on the corner angular turrets (or pavilions) with their echo in the roof, vaguely recalling Chambord, and the aforemen- tioned irregularities in the placement of the windows. Still another possible tie with Maulne appears in Serlio's manuscript in Munich in the design of a "Padiglioni da Bagno in forma di grotta" for the grand garden of Fontaine- bleau, "oltra . . . li ricchi cortili, la bella et abbondante fontana, il largo et longo stagno fatto da essa fonte . . .39; it was one of the first projects in France to relate to antique nymphaea. Probably intended for the large garden, the pavilion appears to contain a vestibule opening onto a circular room; the center is occupied by ". . . una fontana di acqua viva condotta dalla fonte del palazzo." The elevation reveals a domed arcaded pavilion resting on a rustic arcaded base whose lantern is remarkably similar to the one that adorns the roof of Maulne. Du Colombier notes analogies between the rustication of the "nymphaeum" and some of the cut's in Ser- lio's Libro estraordinario.40 Additional use of this rough masonry derived from Serlio-for instance, the rustic ornament in Book Four (Fig. 28) or the articulation of the rustic portal, as also the distribution of windows on the elevation of the House of the Tyrannical Prince (Munich MS, fol. 31; and Fig. 27)-may be found on the central portal surrounded by niches and supplementary doors in the garden fagade of Maulne (Fig. 29).41 The picturesque perspective view of the chateau by Israel Sylvestre, dated 1645, reinforces connections with Serlio (Fig. 7) and provides an interesting comparison with its present reality (Fig. 30). What seems to be an enormous sunken basin, entitled Fontaine on the Du Cerceau drawing, is on the Sylvestre engraving a waterway that extends under the triple-arched rusticated fagade of the chateau; the symmetrical gardens of Du Cerceau are replaced by a more rugged, natural- istic setting. Of course the Sylvestre view may reflect the state of neglect of the abandoned immediate environs of Maulne, whereas the canal may be a romantic addition of the artist himself. Other changes are evident-for example, Du Cerceau's pointed pyramids serving as conduits are replaced by a massive pyramidal form crowned by a lantern. Sylvestre's print, with its stress on the regularity of the fenestration, contributes to the greater strength and cohesion in the general aspect. Certain rather bizarre architectural details, such as the ornament of the window frames, the manner in which they punctuate the facade, and the capricious display of rustica- tion and d6cor remind one of Vignola's original project for the Palazzo Bocchi in Bologna of 1545 (Fig. 31), begun a few years after his return from Fontainebleau: the rough- hewn blocks, obelisks, and sculptural work are attributable to the style of Fontainebleau artists.42 This comparison strengthens the case for Serlio as designer, 3" Du Colombier, 218.

For Peruzzi's Uffizi drawings, see too W. W. Kent, The Life and Works of Baldassare Peruzzi, New York, 1925, pl. 72. On 49, Kent hypothesizes that some of the Uffizi sketches (for villas with bastion towers) were probably suggested by plans of Peruzzi's military bastions, and may be early studies for Caprarola. Myra Rosen- feld, "Sebastiano Serlio's Late Style in the Avery Library Version of the Sixth Book on Domestic Architecture," Journal of the Society of Archi- tectural Historians, xxvIII, 3, 1969, 157-58, also cites this castle by Serlio as based on a Peruzzi drawing for the Rocca di Caprarola.

I am grateful to Bates Lowry for having first brought my attention to the Sylvestre engraving and its relationship to Vignola's palace (cf. note 20). The facade decoration about the windows on the Sylvestre print is also similar to that on Peruzzi's Palazzo Massimi in Rome. Again, the Bolognese origins of the leading artists in Fontainebleau in the forties should be stressed-eg., Serlio, Primaticcio, Vignola, Nicolo dell'Abbate-the Floren- tines had been replaced by Emilians. Peter Collins has suggested the possibility that some of Ledoux's designs may have been influenced by Sylvestre's view, especially the "projects for geometrically-regular buildings on ground traversed by canals." See particularly the House of M. de Witt and the Chfiteau of Equiere. Collins also notes that Ledoux built a mansion in Paris for the Duc d'Uzes and did work in Auxerre.

It also raises the possibility of assigning the Chateau of Maulne to another architect associated with Vignola in works for the Farnese family. Francesco Paciotto, best known as military engineer and archi- tect for Phillip II at the Escorial, worked on several palaces attributed to Vignola. In 1558, Cardinal Farnese consulted Paciotto, requesting modifications of Vignola's design for Caprarola. These alterations were largely concerned with means of circulation by interior stairwells and galleries and were incorporated into Vignola's revised design of 1559.43 Moreover, Paciotto did the preliminary designs for the Cittadella in Piacenza in the estilo desornamentado that would become the style of the Escorial. Documents relating to Paciotto's plan for the Monastery Church in the Escorial reveal an overwhelming concern with proportion and number, unity and simplicity, all expressed within a highly complex system. Several features of the Citadella in Piacenza may be connected with Maulne, the most prominent being the marked axial symmetry, the predominance of geometric form, and the presence of an amphitheater comparable to the Vatican Belvedere. Here too, as at Caprarola, Paciotto's original design was more austere, revealing his forte as a military architect. Because of his alleged membership in the Accademia della Virtiu, as well as his own activity-e.g., his measured drawings of the Baths of Caracalla in 1540-it is likely that Paciotto was acquainted with the circle of French and Italian architects then studying in Rome.44 Further possibilities of a tie with Maulne are supported by his eminence as a military architect and engineer in the fifties, when he was engaged on fortifications and roads in Ancona and Parma, and throughout Piedmont, Savoy, Flanders, and Picardy. In 1564 we find him working on a citadel at Antwerp in the form of a pentagon.45 The probability of Paciotto's presence in France around 1566 surely exists; and with his experience in designing military fortifications, he would be qualified to be the architect of Maulne, whether working independently or following one of Serlio's original projects. But if the design of this singular chateau may be related to certain plans by Peruzzi or Serlio or Paciotto, the foun- tain too has a definite forerunner, the Well of St. Patrick in Orvieto, dated 1527- 1535 (Figs. 32, 33). Upon fleeing to Orvieto after the Sack of Rome, Pope Clement VII found that the only plentiful source of water for the city was situated at a great depth near a citadel.46 To reach this subterranean structure, 62 meters deep, it was necessary to excavate across the crest of a mountain. One of two civil engineering projects designed by Antonio da Sangallo, this immense well is connected to that of Maulne through its location at the base of the staircase. According to Vasari "la qual opera, che fu cosa ingegnosa, comoda e di maravig- liosa bellezza" was accessible by means of two separate spiral ramps enclosed by two walls and reunited at the bottom by a bridge, so that it was possible to descend by one and mount by the other without meeting.4' Since Sangallo's interior wall is replaced by columns at Maulne, the Orvieto ramp seems closer to the staircase of Caprarola or to those helical ascents derived from Bramante's impressive model within the Belvedere tower which were known to Serlio.48 The architect of Maulne may also have been cognizant of the passage pertaining to the placement of wells in Alberti's Architecture (trans. Leoni, 1726, i, xiii): "I am particularly for having the Wells set in the most public and open part of the structure, so that they do not take off from the Dignity of the work, by being set in a place improper for them; and the natural- ists affirm, that water most exposed and open is best and most purified." Considered as either a Huguenot or a Catholic re- treat, or as a fortified citadel, Maulne suggests antique and medieval precedents for water supply for a besieged city.49 Might not the construction of the chateau around a well be part of a general program of defense during the Religious Wars-especially in view of the Duc d'Uzies's political position as a moderate Catholic? Because Louise often acted as an intermediary between the Catholics and the Huguenots, the fortress-like character of the chateau may once more be emphasized. Moreover, the principal innovation of the well 43 I thank Loren Partridge for introducing me to Paciotto studies, and in particular, George Kubler, "Francesco Paciotto, Architect," Essays in Memory of Karl Lehmann, New York, 1964, 176-189, esp. 180. Cf. Lotz, 35-46. Paciotto's role in the design of Caprarola is also described by Angelo Borzelli, Jacopo Barozzi con Francesco Paciotto: Caprarola e la Citta- della, Naples, Rocco Bevilacqua, n.d., 4-10, but the dates here contradict other sources. Still, Paciotto's description (in a letter to Cardinal Farnese, allegedly of 1552) of the transformation of the courtyard to include a well surrounded by a spiral ramp draws even closer to Maulne, as also, translated from p. 10, "Those niches which are excavated in the rocks in place of the parapets that Vignola had made could serve simple things and with beautiful fountains. . ." 44 See Kubler, "Paciotto, Architect," esp. 180-89.

Perhaps even more pertinent for Maulne as suggested by Du Colombier, 216, is the grand and graceful spiral stairway attributed to Peruzzi in the Villa S. Colomba near Siena. See Venturi, Arte italiana, xi-I, figs. 381, 382. Again Du Colombier notes that although Peruzzi had no direct rapport with France, his ideas could readily be transmitted by Serlio. See Rosenfeld, "Serlio's Late Style," 157-158. Cf. Gustavo Giovannoni, fig. 304 (Uffizi 1074) for Sangallo's well for the Farnese in Orvieto (1527- 1537). 49 Excavations on the northern slope of the Athenian Acropolis led to the discovery of a Mycenaean stairway, dated around the 13th century B.C., which descended to an underground fountain or well (the earliest known artificial water supply of ancient Athens). See O. Brunner, "A Mycenaean Fountain on the Athenian Acropolis," Hesperia, viii, 1939, 317-429 (esp. 317, 346, 423-29). The spring cited in Plato's Kritias is identified with the Mycenaean fountain.</page><page sequence="14">THE CHATEAU OF MAULNE 209 32 Well of St. Patrick, Orvieto, exterior, cross-section, plan (photo: Vera Fotografia) 33 Well of St. Patrick, Orvieto, interior (photo: M. Moretti) at Maulne appears to be that it is in the center of the "don- jon" (as compared with medieval practice). Maulne's relation- ship to the Orvieto Well might also be viewed in the light of the cylindrical form of the ducal palace in Uzes (Fig. 34).50 Aside from Serlio's plan for the Louvre, a symmetrical axial arrangement such as the plan of Maulne is compara- tively rare in France during the reigns of Francis I and Henri II. The few known examples, dating back to the early years of the century, are the more Italianate Chateaux of Verger and Bury. In its suggestion of different levels, Maulne parallels the Chateau of Verneuil, begun ca. 1568. The emphasis on water, however, is new at Maulne, and in a sense allies it with more immediate Italian predecessors and with such contemporary schemes as that of the Cardinal de Bourbon for Gaillon. In its general layout revolving around water, in addition to its marvelous play of concave and con- vex circles and ellipses, the plan of Maulne once more re- calls that of Caprarola. Water also delineates the axis of the sites of all the conspicuous fountains, grottos, and statues in the Medicean villas outside Florence. Certain aspects of Maulne compel us to examine Leonardo's project for an ideal city at Romorantin. Planned for Francis I in 1517, Leonardo's scheme included a royal palace and designs for the canalization of the Sauldre.51 Again, as- suming that Serlio played some part in the design of Maulne, and because his sources were eclectic, it is highly probable that his ideas were partly derived from the work of Leonardo. Evidence for this is implied in Serlio's Il secondo libro di prospettiva (Venice, ca. 1551), and is reinforced by Cellini in his Discorso sulla architettura, in which he tells of loaning 34 Chateau d'Uzbs, tower (photo: Archives Photographiques, Paris) 50 I am extremely grateful to Peter Collins for this particular idea. See too Picq, who suggests that the pentagonal form of the chateau is only a sym- bolic reminder of the older dungeon built by the Clermont family. 51 Carlo Pedretti, A Chronology of Leonardo da Vinci's Architectural Studies After 1500, Geneva, 1962, 145-46, suggests that the projects for Romorantin may possibly have been executed earlier in 1515-16.</page><page sequence="15">210 THE ART BULLETIN his copy of Leonardo's book on painting to Serlio.52 In studying the plans of Romorantin, the possibility of the in- fluence of Leonardo becomes even more intriguing. May one postulate the existence of a pentagonal plan among the drawings of Romorantin or the lost Leonardo sketches? It is not unlikely in view of other geometric schemes by Leonardo utilized by Serlio. For example, a building design by Leonardo on a square plot is composed of eight octagonal units about a cruciform courtyard with a circular fountain in the very center (Codex Atlanticus, 114v, 1518). Serlio's plan of an octagonal temple has similar components, as does the project for a bath pavilion in the garden at Fon- tainebleau.53 Consider too Leonardo's possible role in the architecture of Chambord. Links between the double stair- case at Chambord and the "intersecting steps" of Cellini are conceivable, although spiral stairs running in counter- directions were a current Italian conceit, a number being noted in Leonardo's drawings.54 That Leonardo's plans could have been accessible to Serlio may be hypothesized by their inclusion in Palladio's Book on Antiquities in which the stair- case at Chambord is illustrated as a marked curiosity.55 Even more meaningful for a possible connection with the plan of Maulne was Leonardo's overwhelming preoccupation with hydraulics in his later years-his studies of the move- ment of water, as well as applied aspects such as its conduct and canalization. The whole remarkable complex of Maulne, the brilliant innovation of the fountain-staircase, and the ingenuity and the practicality of the plan seem to point to an indirect derivation from Leonardo. That such plans were within the sphere of his interest is confirmed by drawings for a large spiral staircase accompanied by studies for a fountain in the Codex Arundel, dated 1517.56 Other re- lated designs include a tower-shaped loggia above a fountain, its machinery cleverly screened from view; also a project for a royal residence at Amboise, with a large basin for aquatic sports alongside; and, of course, plans for the canalization of Romorantin.57 Like all Renaissance architects, Leonardo was adept in fortifications, and the fortress itself was an imposing sym- bolic form in the environment. The citadel was then a meta- phor for the microcosm, and subsequently the art of fortifica- tion has been used as a key to interpret Renaissance urbanism: for instance, in P. Cattaneo's treatise a fortified city is superimposed on the astrological pentagon of Agrippa von Nettesheim.58 Above all, Maulne is a chateau-fort, a typical fortified system of regular walls with towers at intervals, with intimations of luxury within. In this sense the chateau may pay homage to past family towers of the Duke and Duchess. Many examples of pentagonal bastions may be found in Renaissance fortifications from Francesco di Giorgio to Cattaneo-and, in fact, this form constituted an example of the new type of urban defense when incorporated into the new fortress town, Vitry-le-Frangois, designed in 1545 by the Bolognese engineer Girolamo Marini.59 A fortified chateau was indeed an appropriate architectural form in the Burgundy of the 1560's. A word on the availability of French architects seems in order, and more specifically, we may ask why the most eminent architect of the day, Philibert Delorme, was not considered by an enlightened patron with a court-con- nected wife. Out of favor after the death of Henri II in 1559, Delorme turned to writing, producing first a book on the ways of constructing roofs and vaults, then a treatise on architecture. A mixture of Renaissance humanism and allegory and magic and mathematics is present throughout Le premier tome de l'architecture, published in Paris in 1567. Book Four combines the geometric knowledge in use in the sixteenth century with medieval traditions of structure, and in an elaborately detailed account of vaulting, Delorme criti- cally appraises Bramante's spiral staircase in the Belvedere. The second volume of the treatise was to be an exposition of his Theory of Divine Proportion, a theory in which propor- tions accord with the human body but are deduced from Old Testament accounts of building designs dictated by God.60 52 Referring to Libro A, Carlo Pedretti, Leonardo da Vinci on Painting: A Lost Book, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964, 3, 164, 174.

Clausse, Les Sangallo, 11, 260, n. 1, citing that contemporary with the Well of St. Patrick, the French architect, Pierre Nepveu, built a spiral staircase with two inde- pendent revolutions at Chambord for Francis I. Several examples of stair- ways with double or multiple revolutions are noted in the manuscripts of Leonardo (e.g., Ms B, fols. 69r, 68v). See Marcel Reymond, "Leonard de Vinci, architecte du Chateau de Cham- bord," Gazette des beaux-arts, ix, 1913, 456-457. Reymond asserts that the double-revolution stairwell at Chambord is quite logical, if viewed as a sup- port for the lantern. On p. 459, he reproduced a central square plan with a prominent central part (Bibliotheque de l'Institut, Paris, Ms K, fol. 116v); cf. the lantern flanked by towers to the dome and lantern of Maulne. Interesting too in this context is the discussion on pp. 444ff. of symmetry as the most fundamental aspect of Leonardo's plans. It is note- worthy, however, that a recent study by Carlo Pedretti has stressed the pre- ponderance of curvilateral stairs, geometric patterns based largely on hexagons and octagons: see "Leonardo da Vinci: Manuscripts and Drawings of the French Period, 1517-1518," Gazette des beaux-arts, Ser. 6, LXXVI, 1970, 284-313. 55 Palladio, I quattro libri dell' architettura, Venice, 1570, I, fols. 64, 65. Palladio's account of the staircase at Chambord belies the fact that he had never seen it; it is apparently taken from an inexact description or an earlier project.

Excursus into Symbolism and Numerology Although the bastioned pentagon is obviously a persistent form in the practices of military architects and particularly justified under defensive political circumstances, it is tempt- ing to think of Maulne in a more farfetched and esoteric light.61 In the plan, three centers are clearly marked along the median axis: the pentagon and circle inscribed in the stairwell, the round court, the curved shape at the exterior of the parterre. But the pentagon is dominant, and this primacy does not seem fortuitous in sixteenth-century France. The fifth of the fundamental geometric forms, the dodeca- hedron (composed of twelve regular pentagons) approaches the sphere in volume and because it is associated with the sphere of the heavens it is the first of all forms. The power of the number five over all things is acknowledged in Plato's Timaeus: "There still remained one construction, the fifth; and the god used it for the whole." In this admittedly puzzling passage, Plato questions if there might be five worlds or one, as there are five regular solids. He speaks of five cosmoi or regions, and the cosmos of the dodecahedron (Heaven) which embraces earth, air, water, and fire and is equivalent to the sphere. The mystical language of the Timaeus is again invoked in Maulne's juxtaposition of the pentagon with the spiral staircase within as an analogy to the movement of the planets in a corresponding spiral--the center, being the center of the world, and the spiral being in accord with celestial appearances. The preponderance of greater and lesser circular segments in combination with an ellipse, pentagon, and spiral recalls the series of circles in Plato's cosmology corresponding to the orbit of the celestial spheres and planetary rings as set forth in the Timaeus.62 Perhaps the plan of Maulne may best be expressed as a demonstration of Wittkower's application of harmonic pro- portions and Pythagorean number-theory to architecture. The relationship postulated between musical consonances and visual proportions may be transformed here into the circle of fifths, five being a circular or spherical number that re- produces itself in the last digit when raised to its powers. Using a geometric scheme of Serlio's, Wittkower shows how ingrained was the harmonic system of ratios in proportion in Renaissance practice as well as theory.63 The number five has been cited as a possible key to opera- tions in Renaissance magic and, in an age of astrology and alchemy, matter is characterized by the occult number five; Macrobius cites five as the type of nature embracing all things and in other ancient writings five essences are noted, five parts of musical harmonies, five zones, etc.; its form is ether, and five senses correspond to the property of number."4 In view of the prevalence of these cults at the court of Catherine de' Medici, and the allegorical content of archi- tectural and decorative schemes, the connections with Maulne do not seem entirely implausible. For example, Agrippa, certainly an important source for the alchemical passions of Catherine, cites "the great command of the pentagle over evil spirits through the power of the number five."65 This force may be further enhanced by association-five as the number of wedlock and justice-and taking this a step further, it may include subliminal allusions to the marriage of Antoine and Louise and references to their political posi- tions: Louise as a negotiator between warring factions, and Antoine, a moderating influence who remained faithful to the Catholic Church. Reinforcement may be attained by the significance of a well nourished by a stream as a symbolic union of man and woman, and even by different sexual roles assigned to upper and lower levels of waters, as part of a cosmic whole.66 Geometricians and artists have been obsessed with the five Platonic regular bodies since antiquity and a passion for the compass was as indigenous to alchemy as to the planner of Maulne. In the 1560's this mania may be confirmed in the number of translations of Euclid, in the Jan Martin translation of Vitruvius of 1544, in the work of Pac- cioli, and in Jean Cousin's frontispiece, "Cing corps reguliers de geometrie" (Livre de Perspective) showing the five regular bodies of geometry including the dodecahedron. 61 Cf. H. Baron. von Geymiiller, Die Baukunst der Renaissance in Frankreich, Stuttgart, 1901, vI, Pt. 2, 370, who describes Maulne as part of a search for an ideal mysterious perfection, while noting the suitability of the bastion form and the enclosure walls around the castle for Huguenot builders (in citing Choisy). See too Matila Ghyka, "Gothic Canons of Architecture," Burlington Magazine, LXXXVI, 1945, 73- 76, who demonstrates that the law of number was paramount in the realm of art and in nature, devoting particular attention to the Golden Section and pentagonal symmetry. Cf. too Du Colombier, 213, citing a particularly imaginative inter- pretation: the plan contains the image of a spur whose main build- ing forms the rowel, the gallery the leg and the offices the heel.

Archivio di Stato, Parma (from Casotti, II Vignola, ii, fig. 242) One may be persuaded to carry the idea of number sym- bolism a step further, especially in view of its recurrence in music and literature at that time. The almost square garden (on the plans) is divided in nine parts including the nymphaeum as one: the eight parterres are in turn all subdivided into four quadrangles-five squares, three rec- tangles. Even a superficial reading will disclose the peculiar importance of the number nine as the multiple that re- turns to unity, the final Reintegration. Nine is the third square expressing the completion and harmonious develop- ment of the universe in its largest meaning; it is the triple development of the Trinity, and a number that cor- responds to the nine terms of Geometry.67 This could be expanded by all the cycles of nature representing four- the forms of the created world-and returning to the oneness in the Timaeus, or proceeding to a Dantesque system. Preoccupation with recondite symbolism and numerology, whether in geometry or symmetry or allegory, is an aspect of the late sixteenth-century mind. Regularized configurations in architecture are paralleled by elaborate poetic conceits contrived as witty and elegant formal inventions. Nowhere is this more readily apparent than in the art of Elizabethan England, in the shape of poems as well as in the plans of buildings.68 Models for the latter may have been pro- vided by French and Italian pattern books abounding in schema far more concerned with geometry than commodity. Wollaton, designed by Robert Smythson in 1580-1588 and based upon a Serlian plan, has been cited as a building that is really an "architectural symbol rather than a house" since its plan bears little relation to its domestic functions.69 A more fascinating document of Elizabethan architecture is found in John Thorpe's book of drawings in the Soane Museum, which contains a number of ingenious variations on geometric themes. They are ultimately related to humanist ideas that invoke the harmonious structure of the universe, the supremacy of perfect forms, and that generally reflect the organic symmetry inherent in the anthropomorphism of the Renaissance. Connections with France as well as Serlio are proved by the designs copied from Du Cerceau's grand work-namely, Ancy, Madrid, and the Theatre of St. Germain-all plans in which a superimposed abstract order governs spatial relationships and effects. Thorpe's drawings include a plan after Sir Thomas Tresham, dated 1580, a house built in the shape of an equilateral triangle in accordance with the medieval symbolism of the Trinity. The triad occupies the three corner towers, which are connected by repetitions of the words non est and est 67 See Allendy, Le symbolisme, esp. 261-62; and chapters on the numbers three, four, and nine. 68 Nicolas Pevsner, "Double Profile-A Reconsideration of the Elizabethan Style as seen at Wollaton," The Architectural Review, March, 1950, 147- 153. 69 John Summerson, Architecture in Britain 1530-1830, Harmondsworth, 1970, 77.

It is a "pious con- ceit" symbolizing the doctrine of the Trinity by an architect who combines passion for his newly found Catholicism with the current mode for formal numerical manipulation.70 It is also possible to see a plan of three rectangles inscribed in a circle surrounded by a circular terrace as part of the same geometric psyche that animated Maulne (Fig. 35). The circular turreted staircases inhabit two of the angles in lieu of the "dead" spaces of Du Cerceau's plan. The descrip- tion includes an alternate solution for the utilization of space.71 Note too in the Walpole Society drawings a plan for a triangular house based on the Longford plan with towers eliminated and a hexagonal fountain in its midst.72 In England as in France, in Wollaton as in Maulne, intricate spatial play coexists with forceful medieval elements. Classical literary sources, though not directly pertinent, may also be recalled. Seneca, in his description of Vatia's villa (Epistle LV. 6), notes: ". . . There are two grottos . made by hand. One of these does not admit the rays of the sun, while the other keeps them until the sun sets. . ." And the mid-century plan may evoke those "chamber-like caves out of which the water flows into an open-air well. It is pleasant to drink. . ." (Pausanius, Corinth iin. iii. 2, 3). Contemporary "bathhouse" grottos were certainly well known at the time, such as the Casino della Grotta in the Palazzo del Te.73 The author of Maulne only needed to turn to the popular literature of the day for his inspiration, since such artifically patterned plans were within the current intellectual main- stream. The architect had ready recourse to Rabelais's work for a description of the Abbey of Thdlme, wherein a fountain stood as the focal point in the center of a court formed by the wings of a regular hexagon. Its antique precedent in Trajan's Port of Ostia made this a perfect Renaissance model. Once more the mode of transmission was a drawing by Serlio.74 Concluding Remarks Both the aggregate of architectural elements and the fact that certain aspects of the overall plans of Maulne and Caprarola are too similar to be accidental, make the ascrip- tion of the design of the Chiteau of Maulne to Serlio or Paciotto-from a purely strategic point of view-entirely plausible. In the light of the Religious Wars, it is hardly astonishing that the fortress element is more important here than in the luxurious Famese villa designed for pleasure. Because the source of Maulne is thus in some way tied to Vignola, his unexecuted plan for the Fortress of Montalto may be profitably studied in this context in regard to placement of bastions, means of circulation, and distribution of interior spaces (Fig. 36). If these musings sometimes appear remote from the provin- cial and unimposing chiteau we see today, its plan still re- flects the primacy of form in Renaissance life and thought. And it is not inconceivable in an age of superstition that number symbolism, astrology, and alchemy made an impres- sion on the humanistically trained architect. The union of the logic of mathematics with the theory of art emerges in what Cassirer calls the "requirement of form," an echo of the pattern of form in Plato's cosmology.75 In the Renais- sance, it is the Italian architects who most clearly effect this synthesis, a manifestation of which is reflected in the design rather than the actuality of Maulne. Here in the plan the idea of the Renaissance persists, an idea born of neces- sity, wherein the power to give form is based on that merger of science and art, reason and imagination.76 Considering the particular nature of Serlio's position in France, and in architectural practice at mid-century, it is not unlikely that the plan of Maulne is derived from a draw- ing by him. Geographical elements as well as stylistic fea- tures tie Maulne to Ancy-le-Franc-e.g., a similar axiality, a comparable relation of chateau to garden, and certain analogous details in the roof and lantern. In Maulne a num- ber of current and slightly older practices are incorporated, most significant being the influence of Caprarola, which reasserts Serlio's connections with both Peruzzi and Vignola, and introduces the likelihood of Paciotto as architect. In fact, Paciotto's presence in France and his affiliation with the Famese as well as his credentials in fortifications and engineering make him the most probable candidate in the actual execution of the chateau. At Maulne too may be recognized the vogue for double staircases, well known in Chambord, but also reminiscent of the work of Bramante, of the Orvieto Well, and of the ideal schemes and drawings of Leonardo. These sources would probably be more readily available to Serlio or to Paciotto than to local French architects, and they serve to produce an extraordinary evocation of the Italian sixteenth century that was only possible north of the Alps.

Ce bastiment est assis en la Forest de Manne, en Bourgongne, distit de deux lieuts d'Anssy le Franc: basty par le feu Duc d'Uzes. Le plan de ce lieu est un pentagone, aux coings duquel par le dehors se voyent comme cing pieds destaux, montans du bas jusques au hault de l'entablement. Le tout n'est qu'une masse, ayant en son centre et milieu une fontaine par bas, en maniere de puits, et entour icelle une montee tout percee a jour, de laquelle on va aux membres: de sorte que montant et descendant l'on voit toujours au fonds la fontaine. En ce bastiment y a poelle, estuves, bagnoires, fort bien pratiquees, " cause de la fontaine: ensemble salle, chambres, garderobbes, et toutes commoditez necessaires " un logis, chascun estage accommod6 de ce qui y est besoin. La couverture est comme une poincte, et au dessus une lanterne " jour, couverte d'un dome: autour de laquelle sont pyramides, servantes de conduits aux chemin&amp;es. Touchant la charpenterie des membres, elle est tout autrement assise que de coustume. Car au lieu qu'en une chambre on y met communement une poultre et deux travees, il y a en aucunes d'icelles quatre poultres, portis les coings au milieu des murailles de la chambre: tellement qu'au milieu du plancher est une quarre angulaire, avec quatre triangles is quatre coings du dit plancher. Aux autres chambres y a pareillement quatre poultres traversantes les unes dans les autres, qui font plusieurs quadres, aucfis quarrez, les autres parallelogrimes, et tous lesdits quarrez en platfonds. Quant a la salle, les poultres y sont posees comme Ion fait es travees: mais au lieu d'icelles y a d'autres poultres traversantes et regnites, entaillkes les unes dans les autres, de la longueur de la salle, a trois ou quatre pieds pres des murailles: de fac6 que par cette maniere d'assiesement de poultres se trouvent plusieurs quadres, et de diverses mesures, enrichis de moulures, en maniere de parquets. En l'un des coings de ce bastiment est le pont en bascule, duquel on va a une gallerie ouverte par bas ' arcs, et en galletas par le hault: et d'icelle a une court ronde en maniere de theatre, oni sont bastis les offices. A l'opposite du pont, I'on sort du mesme logis en un jardin, qui a en son entree une fontaine, oui l'on descend quelques degrez: qui est la mesme source de celle du Chasteau. Entour ce lieu vous avez encor les commencemens des forts, dressez suyvant le dessein du plan que je vous en ay figure.
