<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CASE OF THE STALLION'S WIFE: INDRA AND VRSANASVA IN THE RG VEDA AND THE BRAHMANAS WENDY OCFLAHERTY THE DIVINITY SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Nearly fifty years ago, one of America's greatest Indologists and translators of Sanskrit poetry, Arthur Ryder, had among his students a young man named Anthony Boucher. Boucher grew up to be not a Sanskritist but a successful writer of murder mysteries, and a literary critic. One of his books, The Case of the Seven of Calvary,l is dedicated to Ryder, and the hero of the piece is a Sanskrit professor coyly named Ashwin (a Sanskrit term that designates the hippomorphic twin gods but literally means "having a horse" or, as it were, "rider"). Following in Boucher's spirit, I would like to dedicate this essay to the man who taught me Sanskrit (and so much else), Daniel H. H. Ingalls; it is in its way an attempt to solve a mystery,2 and it deals with horses and riders. More specifically, I hope that the riddle that it poses and attempts to solve, the riddle of the cross- breeding of horses with other species, will find favor not only with Ingalls the Sanskritist but also with Ingalls the breeder and tamer of horses (hippodamos, or, in other words, asvin). 1. MENA AND VRSANASVA AS HUMANS OR ANIMALS AMONG THE MANY MYTHS with which the Rg Veda tantalizes us, dropping a few bold clues but casually neglecting to provide anything like a full report, there is one unsolved mystery that has remained on the books for close to three thousand years: the case of Indra as the wife of the stallion. The episode is mentioned several times in the Rg Veda, and every time that K. F. Geldner, for instance, comes to it,3 he calls it "J1unkel" and refers the reader to its other, equally dunkel, occurrences. This darkness remains, in Geldner's view, despite the potential illumination offered by several Brahmana explanations of the incident, some of which Geldner cites in his despairing notes, though he does not seem to take them seriously. This tendency to ignore the Brahmana glosses on the PRg Veda in general, and on this myth in particular, can be traced back at least a century, as far as Eggeling's scornful dismissal of the Sadvim.na Brahmana version of the Indra episode: "The later explanation of the simple statement of the Rik seems of doubtful authen- ticity, unless the choice of the word mena for 'wife' was intended by the bard as an allusion to the name of the king's daughter. It is more likely that the myth alluded to in the Rik had been forgotten at the time of the Brahmanas, and a new version of it was invented, based on the 'mena' of the original."4 It is my contention, however, that a closer examination of a number of passages in the Brahmanas will carry us out of the Vedic shadows--and I think we will still be talking about the same story that the Rg Vedla is talking about. The first problem that we encounter in dealing with this myth is posed by the uncertain meaning of the word for the female into whom Indra transforms himself, the meni about whom we have already heard ' Actually, William Anthony Parker White was the name of Ryder's pupil, who published The Case of the Seven of Calvary under the pseudonym of Anthony Boucher in New York in 1937. 2 Jan Heesterman recognized the murder-mystery aspect of the Vedic world long before I did, when he published "The Case of the Severed Head" in the Wiener Zeitschrift zur Kunde dles Sud- und Ostasiens 11(1967), pp. 22-43. 3 Karl Friedrich Geldner, Der Rig- Veda aus dlem Sanskrit ins Deutstche Uhersetzt und mit einem Laufenden Kommentar Versehen (4 vols.

This word occurs in closely related contexts in three Rg Veda passages: I. (Rg Veda 1.51.13): "You gave to the aged and stagger- ing Kaksivant, when he pressed Soma, a young girl named Vrcaya. You became the wife [mend] of the seed-bearing stallion [or bull-stallion, 'r.sana.~va], 0 mighty one. All these [deeds] of yours should be proclaimed in the sacrifice." 2. (Rg Veda 10. I 1 1.3): "The unfailing [Indra] became the lord of heaven, irresistible, born long ago; he made a wife [mend] for a bull [go]." 3. (Rg Veda 1.121.2): "As a buffalo, [Indra] desired the seductive female [vrd] born from himself. He made the wife [mena] of a horse into the mother of a bull [go]." The word mend, that I have translated as "wife," is taken in this sense by many of the early Indian and later European commentators, but other commenta- tors, both Indian and European, have taken it as a proper name,5 Mena (a name that does occur in later Indian mythology: Mena is the wife of the mountain Himalaya and mother of the goddess Parvatj6). But it is difficult to take mend in this sense without forcing both the structure and the meaning of the passages in question, which seem to imply not only that mend is a female but that she is a female associated with male animals-that is, that she herself is a female animal. This association with male animals proved no obstacle, however, to the commentators who were determined to take Mena as a proper name; they simply took the seed-bearing stallion as a proper name, too, the name of a man called Vrsana'va ("Possessing Seed-bearing Stallions"). This leads to a circle dance of tautological interpretation: either both the man and the woman are animals, or they are both human. There is support for the argument in favor of taking Vrsanasva as a name, similar in nature to the support for the name Mena: compound nouns ending with the word for horse (asva) occur often as the names of Indian kings (just as the names of many Greek aristocrats7 end in derivatives of hippos). Our second and third passages, however, weaken the argument for the association of Mena with a man named Vrsanasva, for the simple but compelling reason that Vrsana'va does not appear in these two passages, but is replaced in one by a bull (go) and in the other by a horse (closely associated with a bull and a buffalo). Moreover, the only other time that the word vrsanasva occurs in the Rg Veda is in an unambiguously zoological context, in a hymn to the Maruts: "O Maruts, lords, with your chariot that is yoked with bull-stallions (or with bulls instead of stallions, vrsanasva), that is strong as a bull (vrsapsu), that has a bull for its nave (vrsanabhi), come lovingly like winged eagles to enjoy our sacrifice."' But if Vrsana~va is an animal, what sort of an animal is he? Geldner suggests that he may be half horse and half bull.9 This mixture of species is supported by the apparent mixture of species of the woman in the third passage, who appears to be first the daughter of a buffalo, then the wife of a horse, and finally the mother of a bull. But it is not necessary to see vrsanasva as a composite animal. Though vrsan in the Rg Veda often designates a bull (as in the invocation to the Maruts just cited), it has a more general meaning that is more important: derived from vrs, to sprinkle or rain down, it designates an animal that freely sheds its seed (a bull, a stallion, or a "stud," a virile man'0). Vf-san combined with asva would thus mean a seed-bearing stallion. I have also included the secondary translation of bull- stallion in order to highlight the overtone of a mixed species, central to the myth of men5 and vrsanasva; but it must be emphasized that this is merely an overtone, not an exclusive or literal lexical meaning, let alone the primary meaning. Geldner hedges, actually, suggesting that, in our first passage, Vrsana'va is either a man's name or an animal that is half horse and half bull." In glossing the second passage, he says that Indra produced a wife either for a bull or for the man called Vrsanaiva in the first passage See, in particular, Hanns Oertel, "Contributions from the JaiminTva Brahmana to the history of the Brahmana Litera- ture."

ANIMALS AND INCEST This series of transformations doubles back on its tracks so often that it is difficult to discern anything like a pattern. Yet we can, perhaps, disentangle a set of parallel movements, a contrasting opposition between incest and the mixture of species, or, structurally speaking, between a process of procreation in which the partners are abnormally closely related (incest) and a process of procreation in which the partners are abnormally distantly related (mixture of species). They are by no means the same process, nor do they pose the same problems; but juxtaposing them, as the Rg Vedic texts themselves do, forces us to consider the ways in which they may explain one another. More generally, myths about animals may show us how the ancient Indians felt about the general pattern of mixed species; and if we read this pattern back into the specific myth of Indra and Mena it may help us to interpret that myth. Let us begin with Indra. Indra in these verses is a buffalo who becomes a bull; he makes a female buffalo who becomes a mare and then functions as a cow. In the first half of the third passage, Indra, by committing incest with his daughter, transgresses the normal barrier between himself and a woman who is of the same class or family (varna) as he is;'7 in the second half, by blurring the line between mare and cow, he transgresses the normal barrier between species. The concept of "species" is also covered by the term varna, which further extends to the four major classes of human society-classes that, according to the classical system, ought not to intermarry, but that do.'8 On the ievel of species, it makes no sense to take mend for the name of a woman; she is a mare, the wife of a horse, who is magically created as a buffalo (which is, after all, a kind of cow), then transformed, equally magically, into a mare, and finally given the (magical) power to produce a bull. When Indra lives in the "family" (varna) of a woman named Mena he is simultaneously living in the "species" (varna) of a mare, a horse's mend. And in one of the Brahmana texts that we will soon encounter, Indra is precisely said to do this very (ambiguous) thing: to live in the family/species of the female that he desires. There is yet another relevant set of links between animals and incest: the different species of animals are said to have arisen as the result of an act of incest, and literal incest among animals is cited as a justification for a kind of symbolic incest among human beings. Several texts, beginning with the Rg Vedic verse about the buffalo that we have already encountered, allude to the myth of primeval incest.'9 The Brahmanas expand upon this theme by stating that when Prajapati tried to commit incest with his daughter, she became a female wild animal (mrg-) and he became a male wild animal (mrrga).20 The Upanisads say that the daughter who fled from her father was first a human woman, from ' Ibid., vol. 3., p. 333, and vol. 1, p. 164.

Continuing in this way, she produces all whole-hooved animals (when she is a female donkey), then goats, sheep, and "all the pairs, down to the ants."2' We will return to this particular list of animals; here let us merely note that it is the woman's shame and revulsion that drives her to transform herself into an animal. This important theme recurs in the Mahabharata, where a certain sage takes the form of a stag, and turns his wife into a doe, in order to overcome his shame and have intercourse with her.22 In other words, certain sexual acts, including incest, are literally "animal" acts, sanctioned among animals but not necessarily among humans. Thus, sexual intercourse is called "lust fit for cattle" (pas'avya- kama). This is expressed in another way in a Brahmana text that argues that every act of procreation is incestuous, since the father first has intercourse with his wife and then is reborn in her as his own son. This text then goes on to assert, "All the beasts know this; therefore a son mounts his mother and his sister."23 In this context, we might argue that Indra becomes an animal (bull or stallion) precisely in order to perpetuate an act of incest (with his buffalo daughter or with the anthropomorphic form of Mena, as we will soon see). Indeed, the connection between transformation into an animal, the act of incest, and the sexual union between a god and a mortal may be even older than the ancient Indian connection; it may be Indo-European. This is suggested by the fact that Plato groups together, as the epitome of what the untamed part of the soul dreams of, the man who "will not shrink from copulating with his mother, or with any other human or god or wild beast."24 And in our time, Freud, and after him Ernest Jones, suggested that the animals that appear in our dreams, often as sexual partners, represent close relatives, usually parents.25 These various overtones add further weight to the argument that Mena in the myth of Indra is an animal, if not necessarily instead of being a woman, at least in addition to being a woman. 3. INDRA AND THE SAGE'S WIFE But the belief that Mena was only a woman persisted in the Brahmanas and in the later Sanskrit commen- taries on the Rg Veda. Ammunition for this argument could have been taken from the first half of the first passage that we cited: "You gave to the aged and staggering Kaksivant, when he pressed Soma, a young girl named Vrcaya." This line, that immediately precedes our problem line, must be about people; for although Kaksivant, like Vrsanasva, has a lexical meaning ("He who has a girth or harness for a horse," as the commentator, Sayana, points out), its occurrence both in the context of this verse and in several other places in the Rg Veda shows that it is a proper name. And if Indra gives a man named Kaksivant a young wife, why can't he give (himself as) a wife to a man named Vrsanasva? Sayana tells a long story about Vrcaya and Kaksivant, of which the main points could be summarized thus: An aged sage named Dirghatamas was thrown into the Gangas by his wife and sons and servants, who hated him for his weakness. He swam up to a king who was sporting with his own wives in the Ganges; the childless king asked the sage to beget a son on behalf of the king, in the chief queen, and the sage agreed. But the queen, who considered the sage too old and disgusting for her, sent her maid in her place. The sage engendered in the maid a son, Kaksivant, who became king; and Indra gave him a young girl named Vrcaya for his wife.26 In this passage, Sayana assimilates the tale of KaksTvant to the Indo-European theme of the old sage who is given a young wife, a wife who often refuses to sleep with her husband and sends a substitute in her place. One of the oldest recorded versions of this story occurs in the Brahmanas,27 and another accounts for the birth 2 lBrhaddranvaka Upanisad 1.4.1-6; O'Flaherty, Hindu MYths, pp. 33-35. 22 Maha-bhhrata (Poona, 1933-69) 1.109.5-31; see O'Fla- herty, Asceticism, p. 187. 23A itarev'a Brdhmana 7.13. 24 Plato, Republic 571 c-d; see O'Flaherty, Dreams, p. 40. 25 Ernest Jones, On the Nightmare (New York, 197 1).

In that story, the young wives (there are three) are at first unwilling to submit to the embrace of the old sage, until they are told the paradigmatic story of Dirghatamas and Kaksivant.9 Thus the theme of the aged ascetic and the young girl is connected with the tale of Vrsanasva both by the folk tradition and by the context in which the reference to Vrsanasva occurs in the Rg Veda: his name is juxta- posed not only with the verse about Kaksivant but with an allusion to an even more famous story about an old sage and a young wife, the tale of Cyavana and Sukanyaf.0 In this context, we are tempted to wonder if this might not be one of the many occasions on which Indra makes love to a woman who has been rejected by her aged or impotent husband; a famous instance is the story of Apala in the Rg Veda.3' There would seem to be an apparent contradiction in the two implications of these texts: either Indra did a favor for the husband by giving him a young wife, or he did a favor for the wife by "giving" her (i.e., by himself becoming) a young lover. Yet, as we shall see, these two interpretations can be resolved by taking into account Indra's ability to change gender (to be all things to all men, and all women), or, even more simply, by noting that he does, in fact, throughout his mythology do both of these things: give wives to husbands, and cuckold those same husbands. In any case, all of this strengthens the argument that Mena is a human woman. Thus Sdyana establishes a richly anthropomorphic, folkloric background for the tale of Mena and Vrsanasva. And when he goes on to explain that tale, in the second half of the same verse, he continues in the same vein: Indra, you became the wife of a king named Vrsanasva. You became a young girl named Mena. The Satyayanas tell a story about this: "The Bounteous Indra became the wife of Vrsanasva and lived in that family." But, when she had ripened into adolescence, Indra himself desired her. For the Tandyas tell another story: "Mena was the name of the daughter of Vrsanasva. Indra desired her.". . . Mena is the name of a female.32 Sayana does not attempt to resolve these two versions: If Indra was the wife, how could he desire the wife? Or, if he was the daughter, how could he desire the daughter? Indeed, if he was the wife, how could he desire the daughter? But Sayana does tell us where he got his two versions, and we can go back to them to examine them more closely ourselves. He first refers to the version of the story told by the Satyayanas, a Vedic school that produced the JaiminTya Brahmana. In the context of explaining the Subrahmanya ceremony, this text says, as Sayana correctly reports, "Indra is invoked with the phrase, 'O wife of the seed-bearing stallion," because the Bounteous Indra became the wife of Vrsana'va and lived in that family [or species]'.33 The Tandyas to whom Sayana refers produced the SadIvims'a Brahrnana, which gives us further information: "Men- aka was the name of the daughter of Mena Vrsanasva. Indra desired her."34 Sdyana wrote a commentary on this text, in which he adds a bit more to the story: "Menaka was the name of a certain daughter of a royal sage named Mena, whose other name was Vrsanasva. Indra desired Menakd."35 The line of development seems fairly clear. The Rg Veda said that Indra became Mena; the JaiminrPa Brdhmana added that Indra lived in that family. This, together with the juxtaposition of the tale of Kaksivant and Vrcaya, apparently suggested to the author of the Sadvimra Brdhmana the idea that the tale of Mena was yet another of Indra's amatory adventures on earth. To accommodate that theme, and at the same time to avoid the contradiction between the statement that Indra was Mena and that he desired her, the Sadvimsa split Mena into two, taking Mena as a man's name and creating a separate character, Menaka (who does not appear in the Rg Veda but whose name, a diminutive, could be interpreted as a patronymic, "Daughter of Mena"). The next step is to identify the male Mena with the already extant Vrsanasva, who now becomes not the husband of Mena but the father of Menaka. (A similar confusion, or proliferation, of generations may be seen in Sayana's gloss on the tale of Kaksivant and Vrcaya: where the original Rg Vedic text says that Indra gave A,8 Nfahahhharata 1. 100. 9 Mha-bhchrata 1.98. 1t R~ V'edla 5.78.5-6; Jaimin- la Bra-hniana 3.122-26; S.topat ha Br~htoana 4. 1.5.1-15; Mahabhhrata 1. 122-23.

This development makes sense in the context of Vedic mythology: to get at Menaka, Indra becomes Mena (a.k.a. Vrsana'va), her father, not her mother. Such a situation may also have been suggested by the incestuous father referred to in our third passage,3" the buffalo who desires his own daughter; in any case, it is a common enough Vedic theme.37 As long as we are committed to the anthropomorphic interpretation, we are forced to choose from a number of reconstructions in which there is an inverse relation- ship between simplicity and plausibility, as is often the case with misguided paradigms; in order to make sense, we must continue to add epicles (new supple- mentary hypotheses) to our original neat orbit of interpretation (the hypothesis that this is a myth about people rather than animals): 1. Indra became the wife of a man named Vrsanasva.38 2. Indra desired Mena, the daughter of Vrsana~va.39 3. Indra desired Menaka, the daughter of Mena Vrsanasva.") 4. Indra became Mena, the daughter (or wife) of Vrsanasva, and desired her.4' 5. Indra desired Menaka, the daughter of Mena, and became Mena himself.42 As if these interpretations were not sufficiently labyrin- thine, Joachim Deppert has suggested yet another. He interprets Sayana to mean that Indra first became "the wife and daughter" of Vrsana'va (himself a composite bull and horse) in a kind of homosexual liaison, and then, by assuming the role of Vrsanaiva himself, became the lover of the wife.43 Here the mind simply boggles.43 Let us return to our original alternative hypothesis, that vrsanasva is a stallion and mend a mare. Even Sdyana, who has been so pigheadedly anthropomorphic in his interpretation of our first Rg Veda passage, is forced to move into the animal realm in glossing the third: The buffalo is Indra in the form of the sun, and the woman is the dawn, (Usas), or night, born of him. He lusted after her, even though she was born of him, for the sun does look lustfully at the night and the dawn, And then there is another marvel, concerning the wife of the horse. For this is the name of a female, and the female, the mare, became the mother or the producer of a bull. He made a transformation and a reversal [\iparTtamn]. One day, in sport, Indra caused a bull to be born from a female horse. That is what is meant here, and it becomes quite clear in another verse that is spoken by Indra. According to this interpretation, the mend is a mare, not a human female. Indra does not turn her into a cow but does make her the mother of a bull, the "marvel" consisting in the fact that she gives birth to a species other than her own. But what is Indra's species in this verse? In the first half of the verse he is a buffalo, but does he remain a buffalo to produce a bull in the mare, or does he turn back into a god, or a stallion, or a bull? The last possibility would somewhat minimize, though not rule out, the "marvelous" quality of his deed in producing a bull in a mare. One would give a great deal to know precisely what verse it is that Sayana so blithely regards as rendering this whole mess "quite clear." It can hardly be our second passage, which in any case is not "spoken by Indra." But Sayana in his gloss on that second passage does connect it with our first passage, when he remarks that Indra made himself into the wife of a bull (where the verse itself merely says that Indra made a wife for the bull), and caps it all by saying that the bull in question was none other than Vrsana'va (in support of which Sayana simply cites our first passage).45 Not only does this further muddy the water when it comes to deciding whether Vrsanasva was a man or a bull (for 36 Rg Vedla 1.121.2.

For if Indra becomes the wife of a bull in one verse, how, if at all, is this connected with the fact that he becomes the husband of a mare (and the father of a bull) in another? Once again, we are driven back to the drawing board. Our clarification must come from some other line of inquiry. Ultimately, the cluster of glosses that take Mena and Vrsana~va as the proper names of human beings produces a top-heavy mass of contradictions that tend to tangle themselves into a knot around two poles of inquiry that concern not Mena and Vrsanaiva, but Indra: What was Indra's species, and what was Indra's gender? We have already seen, in the context of the connection between animals and incest, that these two questions are closely related: one may change one's species in order to side-step a problem related to one's gender. Our hermeneutic statement on the question of the species of Mena and Vrsana~va leads to a corollary statement on the question of the species of Indra. Let us therefore set the species aside and consider the question of the gender, or more precisely the change of gender, of Indra in this myth; and we will soon see that this leads us back, this time with a plausible solution, to the problem of his species. 4. INDRA'S CASTRATION AND RESTORATION One rather technical sacrificial text provides a clue to the ambiguity of Indra's gender in the tale of Vrsana~va: Nirrti [Disorder, incarnate as a Fury] seizes the woman who has the form of a man and the man who has the form of a woman. Through the sacrifice one frees oneself from Nirrti.... When Indra became the wife of Vrsanaiva, then evil Nirrti seized him. The evil that he expelled became a eunuch. Whoever thinks that he has been seized by evil, by darkness, should sacrifice this castrated animal for Indra.46 There are a number of difficult but significant points in this text, some of which are best clarified by comparison with other relevant texts. Indra begins by changing his sex on purpose, becoming a woman apparently in order to be near Vrsanaiva (or the daughter of Vrsandsva, if we are to believe the Sadvimsa Brdhmana). That he does this on purpose, and that at first he retains his ability to change back and forth again, in order to further his amatory escapades--first becoming a woman to get close to the woman, and then becoming a man in order to enjoy her sexually---is barely implicit in this text, but quite explicit in one closely related to it: Indra loved the demoness [AsurT] named Vilistenga. He went among the demons becoming a woman among women, a man among men. He thought that he had been seized by Nirrti; then he found this castrated animal that was offered to Indra and to Nirrti. He sacrificed an animal in the form that he had.4' Despite the initial convenience of serial androgyny, it appears from both texts that what begins as a strength soon turns into a weakness. When Indra becomes a woman, he is "seized by Disorder." The primary disorder is simply the mixing of this set of categories: when a man is not a man, but a woman, order is shattered. But more specifically, Indra becomes like a castrated animal or a eunuch. Perhaps he gets trapped or stuck in his female form and can't change back to a man again, as happens to other serial androgynes in later Hindu mythology.48 It may be that "darkness" or blindness afflicts him, as it often afflicts those who commit sexual transgressions or excesses: Dirghatamas is blind (his name means "long darkness," and he is blinded for attempting to rape his brother's pregnant wife); Cyavana is blinded by Sukanya in the Maha- bhhrata version of the story, and one of the AMahii- bharata heroes is born blind because his mother closed her eyes when she was forced to sleep with the disgusting old sage.49 Or it may simply be that to be changed into a woman is to be castrated; here, as so often in Indian mythology, change of sex, androgyny, castration, and the eunuch are closely related.50 But, in any case, Indra then makes use of both the castrated animal and the eunuch to cure himself and, even more, to transform his weakness back into a strength again. He is restored 46 MairdiwanT Samhitd (edited by L. von Schroeder; Wiesbaden, 1881), 2.5.5. 47 Kathaka Samhita [Die Samhita der Katha-Qidkha] (3 vols.; Leipzig, 1900), 13.5. 48 See O'Flaherty, Women, pp. 299-309, for the case of Sikhandin in the Mahabharata (5.189-93), and other in- stances. 49 Mahabharata 1.98 (Dirghatamas); 3.122-23 (Cyavana); 1I.100 (Dhrtarastra).

Let us look at these two methods one by one. The castrated animal consecrated to Indra is usually a ram.5' Since the ram is "in the form that (Indra) had," according to our second text, i.e., since both the ram and Indra lack testicles, the castrated ram is an appropriate offering to the castrated Indra. In the Rg Veda, Indra is called a ram, and in the Randyana the testicles of a ram are used to restore Indra after he is castrated in punishment for having seduced the wife of a human sage,52 a parallel to the episode with the wife of Vrsanaiva. In the course of the sacrifice, it is implied, the testicles that the ram loses are somehow transferred to Indra. Moreover, at the end of it all, Indra is stronger than ever: the testicles of a ram are even better than the ones that he had to begin with. Support for this interpretation may be seen in a highly obscure and obscene hymn in the jg Veda, that refers tantalizingly to the tale, never told, of Indra and Vrsakapi. The name of Indra's alter ego in this hymn is highly significant for our purposes: kapi means a monkey, and vrsa- is yet another form of our old friend vrsan, so that Vrsakapi is "The Seed-bearing Monkey."53 The text is far too elusive to allow of a confident interpretation, but it does seem to contain several relevant elements: the monkey is a son of Indra who makes sexual advances to Indra's wife, the monkey's mother; he makes fun of Indra's inadequate virility and boasts of his own; he is castrated, and Indra takes on the monkey's powers while transferring his own sins to the monkey:. In a similar way, during the ancient Indian horse sacrifice a stallion was killed and, after the queen pantomimed ritual copulation with the horse, his virility was transferred to the "cuckolded" king.55 Significantly, Indra himself is said once to have taken the form of the sacrificial stallion in order to sleep with a queen he desired.56 Let us now read this pattern back into the episode of Indra and the castrated animal and Nirrti. First of all, we can surmise that the virile animal is a symbolic form of the virile Indra, for throughout the .Rg Veda Indra is routinely praised for his powers as a stallion, a bull, a ram. But then Indra temporarily loses his sexual powers; the Brahmanas regard Indra's sexual transfor- mation, however motivated, as evidence of a problem rather than a miracle, as one of the tight spots that Indra gets himself into from time to time (like Zeus or Wotan), rather than as one of his glorious deeds, that are also celebrated in these texts. At this point, the animal is castrated to make it an appropriate offering to the now "castrated" (i.e., no longer masculine) Indra, and this animal is then sacrificed to Indra. This is the implication of the phrase, "Through the sacrifice one frees oneself from Nirrti." And just as the animal's sexual powers are transferred to Indra, so the impotence of both the animal and Indra is transferred to the eunuch. This is the implication of the phrase, "The evil that he expelled became a eunuch." Similarly, as we have seen, Indra's evil is transferred to the monkey; and another text explains that the eunuch was created from the evil cast off from the middle realm when the three worlds were separated. Thus Indra loses his virility through his contact with the human species, and regains it through his contact with the animal species. He becomes a woman in order to indulge his sexual appetites, and then finds that he must "become" an animal the sacrificial surrogate- in order to regain the powers that he has lost through that very indulgence. He pays for his amours but is ultimately strengthened by them. All of this is relevant to the tale of Vrsana~va. But there is one final way in which the transformation of Indra's gender is connected with the transformation of his species. We have noted that Indian thought tends to lump together various different forms of non-masculinity: change of sex, androgyny, castration, impotence, and the eunuch. There is yet another term in this series, however, that 5 ?Satupatha Brahmana 12.7.1.10-12; Rmalvana (of V1l- miki; Baroda, 1960-75) 1.47-48; O'Flaherty, Asceticism, pp. 85-86; Hindu Ml'ths, pp. 94-96. 52 Rg Veda 8.2.40; Ra-maiana 1.47-48. 5 .Rg Veda 10.86; O'Flaherty, The Rig Veda, pp. 257-64. 4 The theme of the monkey as cuckolder endures in Indian folklore.

This concept will supply the final piece in our Vedic jigsaw puzzle. 5. FERTILE MARES AND BARREN MULES The Brahmanas furnish us with evidence that Indra's act in fathering a bull on a mare is not really the "marvel" that Sayana suggests. For they tell us that the mare has "double" seed and can accommodate both the stallion and the donkey. Thus one might argue, rather literally, since the mare gives birth to both foals and mules, why not to calves? But this is hardly conclusive. The simple answer, which the ancient Indians must have known as well as we do, is that horses and mules are members of a single species (equines), while cows (and buffaloes) are bovines. But the general pattern of the mixture of species that emerges from this cycle of myths indicates a general structure of symbolic thinking, rather than a specific policy of animal husbandry, and that pattern makes good sense of our problem text. This cycle of myths revolves about the relationship between the mare and the seed of a series of male animals other than stallions. The simplest version of this myth goes like this: Prajapati created the creatures and then laid hold of them in the twelfth month; therefore the females bear their young for ten months and bring them forth in the eleventh. From these female creatures as Prajapati was laying hold of them, the she-mule went away. Prajapati followed the mule and took away her seed, which he then wiped off on the mare. Therefore the mare has double seed, and therefore the mule is barren, for its seed had been taken away.5' Prajapati starts the process of reproduction going and then brings it to its fruition by touching the females, ending their pregnancy and bringing about their parturition. The she-mule departs, apparently in order to go on being pregnant without giving birth; Prajapati then punishes her, appropriately, by making it impos- sible for her ever to give birth at all. He "wipes off" the seed on the mare, which means that he transfers the seed to the mare, just as the evil cast off by the castrated Indra/ ram is transferred to (wiped off on) the eunuch. The point of this first version is that the barrenness of the mule results from (and corresponds to) the double fertility of the mare. The nature of this double fertility is not made explicit in this text (for mares do not usually bear twins, or bring forth twice as often as other animals, or anything of this sort), but another Brahmana tells us that "A mare with a foal is the sacrificial fee, for she gives birth to both a horse and a mule."'59 The barrenness of the mule is proverbial in India. The mule in Sanskrit is called asvatara (female, asvatari), "a sort of a horse" or "more than a horse," and a king who fails to subdue his enemy is said to conceal and harbor death, "just as a she-mule [conceals and harbors] her embryo."60 This seems to imply that the mule does conceive an embryo but never brings it forth, perhaps because it is dead, which may be an echo of the ancient myth in which the female mule wants to keep her embryo inside her instead of bringing it forth in the natural manner. Or it may imply that the mule conceives an embryo that kills her when it comes forth, as the unsubdued enemy will kill the king. This second view is explicitly suggested by the commentary on the verse just cited, that asserts, "It is well known that only by bursting its mother's womb is the offspring of a mule born from her."61 It is interesting to note that this same assertion is made in glossing another passing reference to mules, in which it is said that the demon Vatapin "had utter contempt for ascetic brahmins and would kill them from within their stomachs, as her foal will kill a mule when it comes to be born."62 Vatapin's modus operandi is also highly relevant to our corpus of myths: for his brother Ilvala would transform Vatapin into a goat that he would feed to Brahmins and then recall out of their stomachs; Vdtapin would come to life and burst out of the Brahmin's stomach, killing him.63 Similarly, Indra himself was kept in his mother's womb for many years, and finally broke out against her will.64 The fact that Indra is as stubborn as a mule in refusing to be born may be related to his "mulish" ability to belong to several different species. The barrenness of the female mule may thus have either (or both) of two rather different implications. On the one hand, it may imply that the female mule can never conceive at all, or that if she does she cannot "' Panc avimsa Brahmana 6.1.1-4; TaittirTva Brdhmana (with the commentary of Sayana; Calcutta, 1859), 6.1.4. 59 Satapatha Brahmana 12.7.2.21. 60 Mahabha-rata 12.138.30. 61 Ct and Cr on Ratnavana 3.41.39 and Ca and Cn on Mahahhdrata 12.138.30. 1 am grateful to Sheldon Pollock for telling me about these commentaries. 62 Ranma vana 3.41.39. 63 Mahahha-rata 3.94.5-10. 64 Rg Vedla 4.18; cf.

One of the Brahmanas lists a "female mule giving birth" as one of a series of unusual but not impossible prodigies, such as earthquakes or showers of flowers falling from the skies.65 In this sense, the "foal of a mule" is a freak, a monster, but not an absolute impossibility like "the son of a barren woman" that is used to denote a logical impossibility.66 On the other hand, the barrenness of the female mule is often connected with some act of violence that destroys her womb, either before she attempts to conceive (so that she cannot) or after she has conceived (so that the embryo, in the act of being born, destroys the womb and renders the female mule barren after that single birth). Either of these implications may already be present in the Brahmanas' statement that Prajapati took away the seed of the she-mule. But in explaining the barrenness of the mule, one Brahmana gives us an expanded version of the myth of Prajapati and the mule, one that explains the mare's doubleness by linking her with another counterpart, the jack donkey, and describes the transfer of seed not from a female mule to a mare but from a male mule to a jack donkey. The passage begins with the same explanation of the eleven-month pregnancy, and then continues: When Prajapati was laying hold of all these creatures, the he-mule ran away from them. [Prajapati] followed [the mule] and took his seed, which he then wiped off on the donkey and on the mare and on cattle and on plants. Therefore the donkey has double seed, and therefore the mare has double seed, and therefore cattle are born in twos and twos.67 On the surface level, that presents the etiology of certain aspects of animal husbandry, this passage demonstrates how it is that the mule is barren, while the donkey can impregnate either a female donkey or a mare, and a mare can be impregnated by either a stallion or a jack donkey. The doubleness of cattle (a term that may include horses or even humans, but here probably designates cows) may refer to twins, which do occur, though equally rarely in cows and mares, but what are we to make of the double seed of plants? This text is conspicuously silent on this issue, but yet another passage, this time in a Samhita, is not: When Prajapati laid hold of these creatures, the he- mule went away from them. [Prajapati] followed [the mule] and took his seed, which he then wiped off on the donkey. Therefore the donkey has double seed. They also say, "He wiped it off on the mare." Therefore the mare has double seed. They also say, "He wiped it off on the plants." Therefore plants glisten even though they are not anointed. They also say, "He placed it in offspring." Therefore twins are born. Therefore the mule has no offspring, for his seed has been taken from hi m.68 This text explains the double seed of the plants (that "glisten" with their inner sap or seed in addition to the solid seed with which they propagate themselves) and goes on to correct the stockbreeding error of the previous text by stating that offspring in general, not cattle in particular, may be born as twins. The offspring may have been attracted, along with the plants, from another myth, for they do not naturally fall into line with the other creatures (horses and cattle) more central to this text. And we do not have to look far to find the myth from which they emigrated: it is provided by the cycle in which Indra transfers to several groups of living things, including plants and offspring, his procreative powers in exchange for casting off his evil69 (even as he casts off the "evil" of his androgyny, his "double seed" male and female , on the eunuch who has no seed, neither male nor female). The use of a tree or plant to receive evil is a very old Indian idea; the Atharva Veda addresses a "wiping-off plant (Apamarga) that removes all sins: "The sin, the pollution, whatever we have done with evil, by you we wipe that off."70 Two final texts in this series connect the theme of the double seed of the donkey (though not of the mare) not with Indra and the myth of transference but with Agni and two other Rg Vedic myths connected with Agni: the myth of the search for the lost Agni ' and the myth of the chariot race. In these two texts, as in the myths we have seen, the concept of doubling, exchange, and substitution is central, but the precise nature of these 65 Sadvimrna Brahmana 6.7.2; another passage brought to my attention by Sheldon Pollock. 66 O'Flaherty, Dreams, pp. 263-65. 67 Jaiminhla Brinhmana I .67. 68 Taiuuirfia Sanliidt (with the commentary of Mddhava; Calcutta, 1860) 7.1.1-3. 69 Ibid., 2.5.1; cf.

The first text is quite brief: When the gods were searching for Agni, they saw one animal for two animals, the donkey for the cow and for the sheep. And since they saw one animal for two animals, therefore the donkey, though he is one, has double seed.72 The donkey is "for" the other two animals probably in the sense of being able to serve as a substitute for either of them in the Vedic ritual; for both the cow and the sheep are sacrificial animals, for which substitutes are often mentioned in the Brdhmanas.73 But this "doubl- ing" does not provide for an exchange in the same way as the "doubling" of the seed of the mare did. The donkey's double seed is not for the two female animals that he is "for," the cow and the ewe; it is for the jenny and the mare. The combination of these two different sorts of equivalences yields us four female animals arranged in two pairs: the sacrificial cow and sheep, and the procreative jenny and mare. The male donkey provides the pivot around which the others move, even as Indra is the pivot for the cow, mare, stallion, and bull in the Vrsana'va cluster. Four animals in two still different sorts of pairs appear in the last text in this series, in which the mule provides a more homogeneous substitute for the ram, so that we have three equines and one bovine (two males and two females): Agni ran the chariot race using a chariot drawn by female mules. As he drove them on he burned out their wombs; therefore they do not conceive. Dawn (Usas) raced with a chariot drawn by cows; Indra with horses. The Agvins raced with donkeys. and the Agvins won, but they wore out the speed and energy of the donkey. Therefore the donkey is the slowest of all beasts of burden, but they did not take away the strength of his seed; therefore he has potency and possesses a double seed.74 The female mules at the beginning are barren; the male donkeys at the end are doubly potent (though not doubly strong); and in the middle we have the contrasting pair of (presumably normally fertile) female cows and male horses. The double seed of the donkey is linked with other special qualities in another text which does not mention the other animals in the group but simply concentrates on the donkey, though the female mule is also present by implication: One gathers things with a donkey, and therefore the donkey is the best of all domestic animals [pasus] for bearing burdens. One gathers things with a donkey, and therefore the donkey grows fat beyond all other domestic animals even on bad grazing, for people gather food and the arka plant with him. One gathers things with a donkey, and therefore the donkey has double seed but gives birth to the least [fertile] of animals [the mule], for Agni burnt out his womb.5 "His" womb must refer to the womb of the mule, not the womb of the donkey (female donkeys being entirely fertile), and it can hardly refer to the womb of the male mule, except perhaps in the sense of "the place from which the male mule is born," which is, again, contradicted by natural evidence of fertile female donkeys. It must therefore refer back to the other myths in which Agni burns out the wombs of the female mules precisely in order that the donkey may have the double seed that is mentioned here. This destruction of the wombs by Agni is transformed in the later mythology into the belief that we have already encountered, that it is the unborn or unbirthable foal of the female mule that destroys its mother's womb. But let us return to the myth of the chariot race. In our text of that myth there are different sorts of exchanges: the female mules whose wombs are burnt out get nothing in return; the donkeys sacrifice speed for virility. In this, the donkeys' exchange seems at first to have the same structure as that of Indra, who gives fertility to those who take his sin upon them. But Indra does not lose his powers of fertility when he grants them to others; he merely loses his sin. Thus he is a two-time winner even as the mules raced by Agni are two-time losers. The ram who gives his testicles to Indra is also, like the mules, a double loser: he gives up his virility, and he gives up his life. Thus, in this text, Indra and the mare are unpenalized winners; the mules and the ram are unrewarded losers. These are "exchanges" only in the most technical sense; in reality, they are thefts, that explain why certain animals have something that other animals lack. The donkeys alone have a genuine and explicit exchange. Yet there may be a kind of exchange implicit in the myths of the 72 2atapatha Brdhmnana 6.3.1.23. Cf. Brian K.

It is interesting to note that there is an Irish variant of the myth of the chariot race, probably derived from the same Indo-European prototype from which the Indian myth developed. In the Irish story, the role of the female mules is taken by mares (who do not appear in the Indian version): a mare-goddess, forced to race while she is pregnant, dies, bringing forth her son and cursing the men of the area to suffer birth-pangs--i.e., to become females, perhaps to lose their own seed just as the female mule loses hers in the Indian chariot race.76 A final task remains before we return to our original Rg Vedic problem, and that is to demonstrate how Indra is connected with these mutually related animals. This is easily enough done. Indra on various occasions is said to have transformed himself into a ram or a buffalo (as we have seen), and, far more often, a horse or a bull; this is the primary manifestation of his malva, his magic power of transformation and creation. More precisely, our Rg Vedic verse about the wife of the bull-stallion is cited in several Brdhmanas77 that neatly wedge it in between verses referring to Indra as a ram and a bull: [One should invoke Indra by calling him] "O ram of Medhatithi" [Rg Vedca 8.2.40], because he became a ram and drank the king [Soma]. And, "O wife of the seed-bearing stallion" [Rg Veda 1.51.13], because the Bounteous Indra became the wife of Vrsanasva and lived in that family. And, "Down-leaping Gaura bull" [Taillirria Arani'aka 1.12.3], for he became a Gaura bull and leaped down into the ocean. Immediately after this passage comes a group of epithets that deal with the human incarnations of Indra, centering around his role as the lover of Ahalya, a human woman who was the wife of the sage Gautama. Through this conjunction of human and animal realms, we can see a thread that connects all of these brief allusions to myths and that makes sense of our Vedic verses. The ram is the animal whose testicles are used to restore Indra after he is castrated by Gautama in punishment for the seduction of Gautama's wife, Ahalya. The ram of Medhatithi is also associated with Indra, who took the form of a ram to attend Medhatithi's sacrifice and who later helped Medhatithi to win two celestial nymphs.78 Medhatithi is also linked with the themes of castration and change of sex (Indra as the mare) through another story told by Sayana: a curse from the gods turned a man named Asanga into a woman, but the sage Medhyatithi turned him back into a man again.79 And the Gaura bull (Indra as the bull) is connected with the mare both through the ambiguity of the bull-stallion (vrsanas~va) and through the Rg Vedic verse in which Indra causes a mare to give birth to a bull. The paragraph as a whole, therefore, is about sexual transformations, mutilations, or trans- gressions in the human world on the part of Indra, that are reversed, restored, or expiated, respectively, by animals. When we combine these various strands of the mythology of Indra's sexual adventures among animals and women in the Rg Veda and the Brahmanas, we can discern not exactly a plot but at least the structure of a plot. Indra seduces a married human woman (Ahalya, Mena, the queen in the horse sacrifice). On the anthropomorphic level, this is a sin, and he loses his powers and must be restored. But at the same time, on the animal level, this same act is a source of the powers that are being lost: in the form of an animal, Indra takes to himself the powers of the animal that he cuckolds (stallion or monkey) or castrates (ram). This is the multi-faceted tale of a god, Indra, who partakes of the virility of what Jaan Puhvel has called the Indo-European "macho trio" (ram, bull, and stallion).80 We have already encountered this trio, imbedded in a series in the myth of primeval incest: the fleeing daughter starts as a human and then becomes a cow, a mare, a female donkey, goat, and sheep, going 76 The Tain, Translated from the Irish Epic " Tain Bo Cuailnge, " by Thomas Kinsella (Oxford, 1970), pp. 6-7, 21-23; O'Flaherty, Women, pp. 167-69. 7]7JaiininTv'a Briihnmana 2.79; Salapatha Briiihniana 3.3.4.18; Sad'i1.sa Braihniana 1.

There is a fine symmetry to this list, in the context of the myths about species that we have just been considering. At the two ends of the spectrum are humans and "ants and everything," the two animal categories that frame the rank and file mammals. Those mammals appear here as the female counterparts of the macho trio: the cow (for the bull or buffalo), the mare and the female donkey (that we have seen to be the two consorts of the stallion), and the goat or sheep (for the ram; the goat and sheep are often jointed in a single Sanskrit noun, ajidvi, goat-sheep, and the two animals, though not of the same species, are very closely related). The list thus encompasses all the defining species of the ancient Indian world, and Indra is closely associated with all of them. The macho trio, and their female counterparts, constitute the class of animals known in Sanskrit as pasu (cognate with the Latin pec us). I have translated it as "cattle" (as in the myth in which cattle bring forth their young in twos), but it more properly designates the domestic animals, in contrast with the wild animals or nrgas. Thus, while the Brahmana version of the myth of primeval incest says that the daughter became a wild animal (nrga), the Upanisads make a major change by saying that she became each of the three major branches of domestic animals (pasus): bovines (cow), equines (mare and female donkey) and extended ovines (sheep and goat). From our standpoint, humans and "ants and everything else" are equally remote from this central group, but in the Indian view the humans, at least, are a part of it. The Atharva Veda says that there are five kinds of pa.us and the context indicates that what is meant is domestic animals suitable to be sacrificed: humans, cows and bulls, horses, goats, and sheep; Sayana's commentary on this text adds that the term "horses" designates all the animals that have a single hoof,82 the term used in the Upanisadic passage to designate the animals that were produced from the female donkey, not from the horse. Yet there are other definitions of pasu that give a separate place to the donkey; another passage in the Atharx'a Veda says that there are seven pa.sus, and Sayana lists the original five, plus the donkey and the camel.83 The Mahabharata puts the finishing touches on the schema, by saying that there are seven wild pasus (lion, tiger, boar, monkey, bear, elephant, and buffalo) and seven domestic pasus (the usual five, plus the donkey and the mule).S4 The buffalo on this list is the wild buffalo, which may suggest that the buffalo in our original Rg Vedic text is meant to supply the wild counterpart for the domestic bull, to imply that Indra is both a wild animal and a domestic animal. That the mule is listed alongside the donkey and the horse with the domestic animals is also significant; I think it implies that the list was conceived along symbolic rather than purely practical lines. The mule may not be a separate species (since it results from the crossing of two species), but it is an animal with a very special symbolic meaning of its own, distinct from that of its two parents. Finally, we should note the implications of the inclusion of human beings in all of the classical lists of pa.sus. Pa.ius are animals fit to be sacrificed to the gods; they are the livestock of the gods, the food of the gods.85 Human beings are simply the best of these animals; what the "macho trio" is to men, the larger group of pa.us, that includes men, is to the gods. When Indra then takes the form of an animal or of a human being, he is participating in the world that nourishes him and gives him his power, through food or through sex or through death, all of which are implicated in the Vedic sacrifice. Indra becomes a woman in the house of a man who is a "stallion," and he becomes a mare in the species of a stallion. He loses power (symbolized by seed) when he is transformed into a female, and he gains power (symbolized by seed) when a castrated ram is sacrificed to him. These various interrelated transformations can be indicated by a chart.
