Reviewed by Peter Gathercole The review which follows is reproduced with kind permission of the Editor of Antiquity. This is a fine publication for which the author deserves the thanks of the Maori people and students of Maori culture. Aileen Fox has assembled a full descriptive catalogue of 63 burial chests in museums in New Zealand and overseas, many previously unpublished. Auckland Museum should be commended for the high quality of production, especially of the illustrations. The result is a definitive study demonstrating not only the significance of burial chests in pre-Christian Maori ritual and thought, but also their high artistic quality. In many respects this is a model monograph. Many specimens have remained unremarked in museum store rooms for years. A few have been illustrated repeatedly in books on Maori carving. Aileen Fox has now assembled a corpus which includes a detailed description of every known example, together with such information as is recorded of its provenance, collector and donor. The details of carved decoration and individual attributes are carefully described, and there is a large photograph of each specimen. As a result, it is now clear that burial chests had a distribution confined largely to North Auckland, which on other grounds is more and more seen as the homeland of the Classic Maori Culture, with its genesis between A.D. 1400 - 1500. Aileen Fox classifies the chests into five types, and on this basis, together with an analysis of their decoration, she proposes a chronology of 300-350 years from A.D. 1500. This depends to a considerable extent on cross-dating from some decorated swamp artifacts found at Waitore, in Taranaki, and associated with carbon dates of the mid-15th Century. At the other end of the time scale, two or the chests possess decoration reminiscent or tattoo designs Known at the time of European contact. This chronology strikes me as consistent and plausible. Most chests are anthropomorphic, and all contained the disarticulated bones of the high-born dead. Typically they were placed in caves where the tapu of the deceased would not be violated. They were therefore objects of great sanctity, and their form and decoration must have possessed symbolic meanings which we can only dimly comprehend. Aileen Fox includes in her commentary a stimulating discussion of the possible meaning of the images carved on the chests. I would like to suggest a more comprehensive approach to the problem. It can be argued that the chests expressed Maori attitudes not only to death itself, but also, more profoundly, to the relationship between life and death. The author considers that the images carved on the chests represented supernatural beings (guardians) not contemporary persons (p.20). This is quite possible, but I think it equally likely that they expressed the process whereby the deceased individuals were reidentified with their ancestors, i.e. that the images represented both groups.</page><page sequence="2">19 One rendering of burial chest in Maori is waka, a receptacle. Waka also means canoe, and, by association, descent group. So the chests might have been symbolic of the whole descent group, including the ancestors. It is interesting in this respect to note that many of the boxes were designed to stand up in the caves. In this position they strikingly recall the placing of ancestral carvings along the walls of the later meeting houses, themselves symbolic representations of tribal groups. This life/death relationship may also have bearing on another important point demonstrated for the first time by Aileen Fox. Of 34 complete specimens where sex can be shown, no less than 20 are female. These the author associates with the Goddess of Death and the Underworld, Hine-nui-te-Po, the Great-Lady-of-the-Night. But the latter was also the Goddess of Conception and Childbirth. From death came life. * _</page></plain_text>
