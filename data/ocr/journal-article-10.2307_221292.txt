<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MIND OF BLACK AFRICA. By Dickson A. Mungazi. Westport, Ct. and London: Praeger Publishers, 1996. Pp. xxxii, 261. $59.95 cloth, $19.95 paper. The thesis presented by Mungazi is simple and straightforward, namely that the colonialism imposed upon Africans was brutal, that Africans resisted and reacted as best they could under trying circumstances, and that resistance ultimately resulted in independence which has since been adulterated in certain countries through the emergence of arbitrary dictatorships reminiscent of the colonial era itself. 6 L.

Mungazi, however, puts forward an idiosyncratic argument. Colonialism was not about such matters as markets, raw materials, and European nationalist amour propre. Rather it was an attempt by European colonialists to capture and dominate the "Mind of Black Africa," a mental and emotional struggle during which colonialism underestimated African intellectual strength and eventually had to yield independence to a triumphant African mind. Here is an interesting thesis, though at once several problems arise. First, Mungazi speaks of the African mind as some sort of continent-wide uniformity, surely a distortion of the great variety of Africans with their many points of view that do not easily fit a single mold. Secondly, Mungazi's African mind appears in his pages as a giddying "anthropomorphic" entity, a kind of Lone Ranger or Batman who pops up at time and place to expose or thwart the evil machinations of colonialism. Thirdly, his analysis ignores much of what was going on inside and outside Africa, phenomena like balance-of-power world politics that are usually taken into account when assessing European colonialism in Africa and elsewhere. There are other difficulties. Mungazi sees the onset of colonialist racial thinking in the assumption of cultural superiority by Europeans, manifest in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He certainly has it right there, but his examples are curious. European anti-African prejudice is traced to individuals like S.T. von Soemmering and Winwood Reade, not without influence in their day, but surely not the best representatives of the so-called scientific racism movement. Much better examples might be Richard Burton, the Count de Gobineau, or the Scottish anatomist, Robert Knox, but we hear little or nothing from them. Also largely missing are those Europeans who championed the African cause. Thomas Winterbottom is mentioned, but where are Granville Sharp, Wilberforce, Buxton, Venn, John Locke, Victor Schoelcher, the Quakers, the English anti-slave-trade and anti-slavery movements? For a balanced dispassionate European view of Africa, we might have had something of the incomparable Barth. Moving on to expressions of the African mind, Mungazi has little to offer earlier than independence-era personages like Rogert Mugabe, Nkrumah, Senghor, Kaunda, or Jomo Kenyatta. Though hardly an African intellectual, the Ndebele monarch, Lobengula, is discussed in connection with the Rudd Concession, but what of individuals like Bishop Crowther, Blyden, Africanus Horton, J. E. Casely Hayford, Apolo Kagwa, Cheikh Anta Diop, or Sol Plaatje? There is a useful discussion of the millenarian Simon Kimbangu, to which might have been added similar anti-European religious figures such as John Chilembwe, and Muhammad Ahmad, the expected Mahdi; perhaps even the messianic Andr6 Matswa movement as well. Senghor is mentioned as one who was corrupted by colonialism, but there is no discussion of Negritude, its achievements and shortcomings. There is a section dealing with the so-called theoretical aspects of violence in colonialism and</page><page sequence="3">478 BOOK REVIEWS African response. This section introduces us to Albert Memmi, but where are Sartre, and particularly, Frantz Fanon? The discussion of traditional African societies would surely make any anthropologist wince: The Africans . . . stressed the importance of cooperation rather than competition; dialo,gue rather than dictatorial action; consultation rather than arbitrary behavior; understanding rather than imposition; and persuasion rather than manipulation. This describes "a social system stressing the importance of justice, fairness, and cooperation." One wonders where in this paradigm to place the brutal civil strife in Rwanda and Liberia, the Sudan and Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, or Zaire. Where may we fit the long-lived intemal African slavery and commerce in chattels, the widespread persecution of strangers and the persistent subjugation of women? Surely the humanity of African societies gains little from such glossy justification. Professor Mungazi has read widely, judging from his citations and bibliography, but his reading seems to lack shape, to be eclectic if not eccentric, with citations ranging from Shakespeare and Dickens to African graduate students (his own?) and individuals not specifically identified. The evidence appears selected. The results emerge more as polemic than study. Mungazi has been victimized by shoddy editing. This is not nit picking, only an accumulation of small inaccuracies encountered in the course of examining other matters-for example, Edward Gibbon, not Gibbons, Winwood Reade, not Wynwood Read, Facing Mt. Kenya, not On Facing.. . , evolue, not 'evalue,' Conakry, not Conacry, and definitely not in New Guinea! The first footnote reference checked had inaccurately quoted the page number, although others turned out okay. Perhaps the greatest problem of all is the fact that Professor Mungazi's African mind never seems to get anywhere. We begin with European colonialism successfully resisted by the African mind. At the end, after 250 pages of mind- numbing tautological contention, we are still at the beginning-a triumphant African mind facing down racist colonialism. One wonders if we have not had enough of that argument, if it is not time to move on to something new, perhaps a fresh look at the colonial period to see what advantages, if any, accrued to the colonized, what distinguishes them from those countries that escaped the ravages of colonialism, say, Ethiopia, and particularly, Liberia.
