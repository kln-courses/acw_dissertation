<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO TYPES OF CONSISTENCY IN a previous article1 consistency was defined as the immediate self-maintaining quality of experience. This does not mean a mere tendency in activities to repeat themselves mechanically. No scheme of stereotyped activities is conceivable in which friction and self-erosion are not present. No list of moral rules covering the activities of life can be so constructed that they can always be obeyed. In obeying one we are sure at times to disobey another. No system of mechanical formule has ever been devised which does not leave 1 This JOURNAL, VOl. III., No. 5.</page><page sequence="2">458 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY many questions unsolved. Perpetual motion in any form-ethical, physical, logical-is 'mere appearance.' No machine 'covers its own reality' or constitutes a self-maintaining whole. Individuality and incommensurability go deeper than mechanical uniformity. The universe has windows through which fresh breezes blow. Neither can consistency be mere selection and adaptation, a per- petual climbing up the climbing wave. Mere selection would be mere yearning, the demand for further experience, the 'prospective reference,' the thing-in-itself, the independence of reality. It, too, is self-exhaustive. Consistency can not be identified with either the law of habit or the law of accomniodation and selection. Yet these laws do enter into the experience of consistency in important ways. Habitual acts are easy, familiar and certain, while readjustment is difficult, tenta- tive and experimental. It is to be expected, therefore, that consist- ency will have a somewhat different character in the two cases. The sphere of habitual acts is the sphere of facts, established institutions and socialized inventions. The sphere of readjustment is the sphere of theories, impulses and inventions. The process of life is char- acterized by both habit and its reorganization, repetition and selec- tion, rational method and empirical method, the same and the different. The relation of habit to readjustment throws light on the fre- quent transitions taking place between facts and fancies. There seems to be no hard and fast line between them. Facts become fancies, and vice versa. Laws become hypotheses, and hypotheses laws. The speculative conceptions of one decade become the assured facts of another, and every such transformation involves readjust- ment and redefinition throughout the entire realm within which the transformation falls. Such transformations are accomplished with more or less emotion and self-reference, with more or less consciousness of outstanding qualities and struggle. They ex-ist so. Conflicts between the vari- ous factors entering into a situation demanding readjustment in order to preserve the consistency of experience, are colored, for all reflective beings, with a personal quality. If a man feels no sudden alarm, no twinge of self-pity or bitterness, no half-voluntary gather- ing of resources as if for war, when some cherished view is over- thrown, it is quite certain that he has never embraced the view in question as an essential feature of a consistent view of things. In any other case the attack would come as a summons to reorganize, on the spot, all his intellectual habits,-a summons against which all the inertia of human nature rebels.</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 459 So long as an activity is new and untried we proceed with cau- tion, attention and a distinct sense of risk. Herein lies much of the fascination of mountain-climbing, gambling and philosophical specu- lation. As activities become habitual and familiar they lose these characteristics more and more. The animosities of artists when some new style develops in literature or art pottery illustrate the point as well as the deep personal concern with which old-school politicians face new situations in government and orthodox thinkers look upon new discoveries in science and new formulations in philos- ophy. Consistency is a sort of tropism for forms of activity which maintain experience, and both the conservatism and the radicalism of human nature fall within it. It is too largely a feeling to be called an intuition. When we have the feeling we say 'there is truth,' or 'there is perfection.' In all judgment much depends upon method and technique. Where they exist, tension and emotion, the concern of experience for its own maintenance, are in abeyance. When technique of judg- ment is wanting, conception is a process of assimilating the object to self-consciousness, a process which tends to define both the object and the self. The first conceptions of things in both philogenetic and ontogenetic development are anthropomorphic. The literature of antiquity and the lore of childhood abound in such conceptions. The keen personal concern which these assimilations show, the atti- tudes of fear and placation to which they give rise, are manifesta- tions of the same psychosis. The earliest philosophers were depend- ent upon self-consciousness for their conceptions of the world. Indeed, wherein lies the sin of philosophical speculation in all ages if not in this lack of method and technique? Wherein lies the sin of science in all ages if not in the subjection of things sacred because of their intimate relation to self to the rubrics of an impersonal technique? Thales's quest for an arche marks the transition from a purely speculative to a scientific conception of reality. From Oceanus had come blessings and curses. A placid sea had meant kindness, and a stormy sea displeasure. To Oceanus men had prayed and sacrificed. Their thought of the god was a projective thought of themselves. The idea that the ocean was not a divine personage, but the arche of all things, invited a reconstruction of the self-con- sciousness of the age, a reconstruction which had to be made with difficulty and anxiety. May not the present disappearing antipathies to the higher criticism and to the scientific investigation of religious experience be other illustrations of the same mood? Tension appears in the scientific camp whenever problems arise on the border line between two sciences and invite modifications of</page><page sequence="4">460 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the methods of both, problems such as those of astrophysics, psycho- physics and so on. Such charges as 'mere speculation,' 'unscien- tific,' 'transcend the power of knowledge,' etc., usually precede earnest attempts to solve the problems. Socrates's humble plea that the phenomena of nature are affairs of the gods into which it is sacrilege to inquire, may have been an expression of the same emo- tion as the outcry of many modern thinkers when the theory of human descent by natural selection was first propounded, the same as the impatience of many scientists when the validity of the atom theory, the ether hypothesis or the laws of motion is called in ques- tion. All science was once speculative, and ceased to be so when judgment became organized and controlled by a uniform technique. There is no fixed line of demarcation between science and philosoph- ical speculation, and this is, perhaps, one reason why attempts to define science and philosophy in terms of their content are so un- satisfactory. The difference between science and speculation is made by the relations of their problems to the self. If a problem falls within some scientific technique it does not involve a transformation of the existing organization of the self. For a problem to fall outside all existing scientific technique means that the self is to be altered. So long as the solution of a problem is going to change the constitution of objects merely, adding a quality here and subtracting one there, the problem is scientific. So far as it involves a reorganization of the self, it is speculative.2 The same distinction is illustrated in another sphere. The earliest morality was a service of the gods. Obedience to the will of the gods, by becoming familiar and habitual, is transformed into an obligation of man to man. The local and tribal customs of the Hebrews have become the common morality of the civilized world. Baldwin holds that the religious consciousness involves an ejective sense of the expressed will of God or the gods, as well as a projective sense of the mystery and inscrutableness of the divine nature. It is the difference between the habitual and familiar, on the one hand, and the accommodative and unfamiliar, on the other. In the experi- ence of individuals who outgrow traditional standards of moral judg- ment, the reorganizing process is often prolonged and painful enough, and such transformations in moral standards are usually accompanied by changes in religious belief. Religion seems, for one thing, to be reconstructive morality, just as speculation appears to be reconstructive science. 2I wish to acknowledge indebtedness to Professor Dewey for mueh of the phraseology of this paragraph.</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 461 Again, these two types of consistency are recognized in the sphere of purposeful judgments-judgments of beauty, utility and indi- viduality or perfection. Habitual judgments of the beautiful are based upon examples rather than principles. They are usually char- acteristic of some school or some movement in art criticism. Some have the hardihood to rely upon esthetic intuition rather than ex- ample, and theirs is a purely esthetic experience, as distinct from an art experience. When judgments expressing esthetic intuition have once been socialized and become familiar, they are part of the or- ganized body of art traditions and possess a certain authority. In purely esthetic experience, on the other hand, no model is before the mind and no act of conscious comparison or analysis leads up to the judgment. It is as if the self deepened and broadened so as to in- clude the object, or rather, so as to transcend all difference between the object and the self. Beautiful things so fit into the knowing process as to commend and glorify both it and themselves. Beauty is the discovery of harmony between the object of knowledge and the knowing mind. We 'lose' ourselves in landscapes, and all strains of perfect music seem to rise out of the soul itself. Similarly we welcome industrial and mechanical inventions as widening the horizon of the self. The telephone brings us nearer together and makes the world smaller. The pearl of freedom is the gain of utilitarian devices. In perfection, means and end are one, the object is an end in itself, a thing of such comprehensiveness and internal harmony that we conceive of nothing more valuable or more real. There is the relative perfection of a thing in its kind, and also the dream of absolute perfection which constitutes our universe of reality. In this experience, also, we revise habitual points of view whenever their inherent inconsistencies become plain to us. What appeals to one age as perfect may be the merest heap of fragments to another Perfection, like beauty and utility, is an essentially limiting concept- They define a limit at which the present struggle, the present self- conscious experience, will cease. Perfection has a different content for each organized setting of social life. Creeds change, worships alter, our admirations shift from year to year. In passing from one city to another, from one companionship to another, the things we look upon with wonder are wont to change. It is sometimes said that every reflective being dreams of realizing an experience so organized in its activities and so comprehensive in its scope as to contain no unsolvable problems, no irremediable wrongs, no defeats. It is the child's longing for a diet of bonbons. Realization is always 'disillusioning.' No one wishes perfection in general.
