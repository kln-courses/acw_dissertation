Rock Art at the Kanaka-Briggs Creek Locality (10-GG-307), Gooding County, Idaho KELLY A. MURPHEY, Hagerman Valley Historical Society, Box 614, Castleford, ID 83321. In 1983 Butler and Murphey reported test excavations undertaken at Kanaka Rapids, near Buhl, Idaho (Fig. 1). Among the dis coveries was a rectangular house floor, its associated cache or storage pits, and an array of artifacts (Butler and Murphey 1983: 16-21, Figs. 5-7, 9-10; Butler 1986:132). Since then, there has been some debate over whether this discovery, the so-called Kanaka II homestead, is evidence of a localized northern Fremont lifeway (Butler 1983a:6) or merely evidence of a great number of var iously assimilated Fremont traits (Plew, in Moffat 1983:B1). For some reason, the over all Kanaka-Briggs Creek settlement system has received little or no attention in this debate. The Kanaka study area extends upstream from the foot of the rapids for about 2.5 km. In the regional literature there had been good indications that some of the five surface-collected sites and six test-excavated sites should yield significant information bearing on local protohistoric and historic Shoshonean occupation. However, this did not prove to be the case. Two sites offered only a few pieces of early-to-middle Archaic material (Northern Side-notched and Pinto projectile points) in addition to late Archaic or Fremont arti facts, and it soon was learned that compara ble material was found at three other dis turbed sites by local relic hunters. The six other sites offered only the late Archaic or Fremont materials. In general, the absence of historic Shoshoni cultural material did not support the theory that Kanaka Rapids had been the site of a major historic fishery, as proposed by a modern writer on the Oregon Trail (Anonymous 1974. 4-23).1 Early ex plorers and pioneers noted considerable sal mon fishing in this vicinity (Butler and Murphey 1982a:5-12). If not at Kanaka, the largest rapids in the locale, or immediately upstream, where did this activity take place? The logical alternative was that it had occurred downstream. After the Kanaka excavations, a site sur vey was undertaken on the lands located immediately downstream. This work soon produced a typical fishery complex in the vicinity of Briggs Creek, about 1.5 km. below Kanaka Rapids (Butler and Murphey 1983:35, Fig. 27). In addition to fish dams, fish weirs, and a wide variety of small and large open sites, there was an unusual aspect to this location: a large petroglyph site stretched across the crest of one of the nearby terraces. This segment of the Snake River was known to have very little rock art; in fact, rock art is uncommon for 150 km. or more up and downstream (Boreson 1975:39, Fig. 2). Due to other pressing research commit ments, this petroglyph site (10-GG-307) received only a cursory examination. Fisheries in the area have been discussed (Pavesic 1978; Plew 1980a, 1981,1983; Meatte 1986), but such a large amount of rock art and its location, in an area where such art [74]</page><page sequence="2">ROCK ART AT THE KANAKA-BRIGGS CREEK LOCALITY 75 Fig. 1.

In late 1985, it became possible to return, and these questions focused the research upwards to the rock art and the terrace beyond, rather than to the fishery below. The association of this site with the local settlement pattern and primarily its various petroglyphs, application styles, motifs, and some related interpretations, comprise the focus of this paper.2 SITE 10-GG-307 This site complex has a total length of about 420 m. It is important to note, how ever, that site 10-GG-307 actually consists of a number of small, distinct loci. The petroglyphs cluster in six areas (areas A through F) along and parallel to the crest of the second terrace above the river. Areas C and D overlap very slightly. The six areas accent the southeast margin of a narrow terrace, while the southwest margin is bracketed by the Snake River. Each area includes seven to 15 medium-sized boulders with petroglyphs. One to seven motifs or elements occur on each. Many of the panels are badly weathered due to their exposure along the terrace crest. In order to adequately represent these, controlled light photography techniques (Peterson 1985: 71-73) were used to supplement standard re cording methods such as sketching, measur ing, and describing. The results per area are summarized below. Area A (Fig. 2) This area is located at the mouth of a natural amphitheater. Seven boulders within a 65 8-m. area display rock art. One sun motif is on the top of a boulder and the other panels face south-southwest (upriver). The application techniques are: (1) narrow, shallow pecking with considerable abrasion; (2) scraping/abrading; and (3) scratching (on the horns and weapons). Ocher-stained mor tars were found near four of the seven pa nels, suggesting some or all of these panels were once painted. Motifs on various boulders include an apparent Rosegate projectile point (Thomas 1983:179-180), a small sun, a mountain sheep, and a large, horned stick figure with ab ducted legs. Horned anthromorphs occur on two boulders. One anthromorph is shooting a bow and arrow; the other is holding a possible spear or atlatl. On the largest panel is an arrangement of seven anthro morphs, several with elaborate headgear, and there also are five geometric motifs scat tered around the margins of this panel. Al though the suggestion will not be argued too strongly, it is possible that several of the figures in Area A (Fig. 2c, far right pair) and others elsewhere are wearing some sort of headgear involving sheep or bison horns, deer antlers, or rabbit ears (see also Fig. 7c). Area (Fig. 3) This area is 18 m. northwest of Area A and at a slightly higher elevation. Seven panels are evident in a 45 7-m. area. One motif crests a relatively flat boulder while the other panels are on westerly surfaces facing the river. The application techniques are: (1) wide, shallow pecking with abra sion; (2) narrow, deep pecking; and (3) deep scratching and pecking. One boulder displays a single stylized bison and another a sun disc. Other motifs include three carefully aligned atlatls with one connected to a possible bison track, a bisected circle, and sun-circle-line connec tions with a stick figure abstraction at the upper end of two of these.

Area C (Fig. 4; Fig. 5a~f) This area is 50 m. northwest of Area B. Fifteen boulders with petroglyphs occupy a 25 5-m. area, and three of these panels overlap with and probably belong to Area D based on their style (i.e., Fig. 4c and Fig. 5d, e, and g overlap with Area D). The panels face south and west. The application techniques are: (1) wide, shallow pecking and abrasion; and (2) scraping with consider able abrading. Two small boulders have stylized deer and geometric motifs. Another boulder displays a single standing or outspread mountain sheep motif. Other motifs include a sun disc, a stylized human head, three styles of stick figures, a diamond-bodied anthromorph with an atlatl, a chubby anthromorph standing in a circle, a footed circle, and some connected ovates. The paired motifs include some fat stick figures, one of them connected to a sun disc, and some horned anthromorphs, one holding a bow. Two relatively large panels show a variety of unconnected geometric de signs including (1) a sun disc, meanders, a dot, and a maze; and (2) a stick figure, a rake, a half circle, a meander, and some loops. Area D (Fig. 5g~i; Fig. 6; Fig. la) As stated previously, Area D overlaps Area C. This area extends 35 m. to the northwest of Area C and it has 11 panels in a 35 4-m. area. The panels face the river. Application techniques include narrow, shal low pecking with abrading, and deep, wide pecking with slight scratching. Single motifs include a chain of diamonds, two styles of mountain sheep, a stick figure, an adjoined anthromorph-mountain sheep, connected circles with tails, and a shield warrior sporting mountain sheep or bison headgear and two stars. One large boulder has a mountain sheep-like stick figure, a sun disc, and a bisected circle. Another panel has a diamond-bodied anthromorph carrying an atlatl, another atlatl, a possible shaft, and a deer or mountain sheep track. The largest panel has two bizarre creatures that are interconnected, a small mountain sheep, a rabbit, some lines, some circles, and several rectilinear meanders. Area E (Fig. Sa-d) This area is 15 m. west of Area D. It extends for 30 m. and includes only four boulders with petroglyphs. The panels face the river. The application technique is nar row, shallow and deep pecking with abrasion. One boulder has parallel lines. The other panels display interconnected circles, suns, lines, squares, and/or diamonds; two mean ders include stick figures, and one lies be tween a possible bison track and a stylized bison with a shaft in its back. Area F (Fig. 7b-d) This area is 30 m. west of Area E and includes three boulders. Each has a diamond bodied anthromorph; all seem to be hunters carrying spears or atlatls. The panels face upriver. The application technique is wide, shallow pecking with abrasion. INTERPRETATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Table 1 summarizes the types of ele ments-motifs per area.

Function Many Great Basin rock art sites have been interpreted with respect to big-game hunting activities (Thomas 1976:65-74). The site interpretations range from shamanistic attempts at hunting magic (Heizer and Baum hoff 1962) to "clusters" actually marking the attack stations of large cooperative kills (Thomas 1976:68; Thomas 1983:349-351). Other related interpretations view isolated glyphs as magic symbols intended to lure game into cul-de-sacs where hunters could ambush them, and yet others note the occur rence of glyphs near major migration trails, water holes, winter feeding grounds, and, in general, at very good ambush spots (Schaafs ma 1986:220-221). Site 10-GG-307 seems to support the interpretation that some amount of southern Idaho's rock art can also be related to one or more aspects of big-game hunting. A hunting context is best supported by the content of the rock art itself. Area A has two hunters, an apparent Rosegate pro jectile point, a small mountain sheep, and an arrangement of anthromorphs that may re present drivers wearing horned and perhaps eared headdresses. Area includes three atlatls, a bison, a bison track, and one hunter who is perhaps in the act of throw ing an atlatl dart. Area C includes a hunter aiming a bow, another hunter carrying an atlatl, two deer, a mountain sheep, and two horned stick figures. Area D has a number of mountain sheep, one small sheep or deer track, and two hunters with spears or atl atls. Area E shows a possible hunter with atlatl, a speared bison, and a track, while Area F has three hunters. In addition, each area has circular and horseshoe-shaped (i.e., footed) motifs that have been related to communal big-game hunting methods else where in the Great Basin (Thomas 1976:72; Thomas 1983:310-312). These horseshoe shaped motifs and some of what I call tracks have been interpreted as vulvas in the cen tral Great Basin, where they supposedly sig nified plenty and were part of the shaman's role in promoting big-game replenishment (Thomas 1976). Studies conducted elsewhere imply that some degree of ritualistic activity might be associated with rock art. Perhaps even the representations of shamans might have been involved, since among the motifs commonly listed as having some sort of a supernatural or hunting cult connotation are birds, medi cine bags or ceremonial rattles (Fig. 2c; Fig. 7a), elaborate hand items or weapons, head dresses, and sun discs (Grant et al. 1968). However, when considering the evidence of this site, it does not seem logical to limit its interpretation to being a place of sym bolic and/or ideological practice, i.e., to the broad magico-religious aspects of group ide ology, ritual, and myth (Lewis-Williams 1982: 198; Hedges 1983). Apparent indications of hunting simply are too obvious not to be included in the interpretation. Besides, there are numerous ethnographic accounts of shaman-directed hunts in the Great Basin, of shamans giving detailed instructions on where to build corrals, and of their telling the people how to act (Steward 1938:34, 105, 120, 128, 163; Nissen 1982:175). The situa tional evidence and the imagery itself in relation to the other archaeological indica tions (Fig. 9) very strongly suggest that this site area resembles a big-game hunting en closure (cf. Frison 1978:252-270). The petroglyphs seem to have been applied to assist in this hunting, apparently in a fune</page><page sequence="14">ROCK ART AT THE KANAKA-BRIGGS CREEK LOCALITY 87 Fig. 9. The location and various aspects of the inferred Kanaka-Briggs Creek big-game trap. Areas A-F are designated. Also shown are the location of the rock wall, 10-GG-303, and the game blind. tional sense, but perhaps also in a magico religious sense. A long rock wall curves into the site. It is, however, unknown whether the wall is entirely of native American origin or if it was constructed in part by early ranchers so that perhaps it "now reflects a composite along the upper Briggs Creek section" (Briggs 1982). I suggest that big-game animals were somehow driven along this wall and onto the south bank of lower Briggs Creek. Another Area A- or Area C-type of petroglyph panel marks the entrance point (Fig. 8e). From here the prey animals may have run along the bank until they were near the Snake River. At this point, they</page><page sequence="15">88 JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN ANTHROPOLOGY may have been turned suddenly to the south onto a low, diamond-shaped terrace immedi ately below the rock art. Above the "turn" segment is a "stacked-rock" game blind (Murphey 1985:55, Fig. 116). If the above suggestions are correct, as the prey animals ran toward the up-river portion of the terrace, concealed hunters may have moved from their petroglyph marked hiding places to seal the trap. Nu merous projectile point tip and midsection fragments occur in the apparent target area. Lacking only petroglyphs, this same scenario has already been reported for an area lo cated about 50 km. to the south (Tucker 1976; Murphey 1985:64-65). Thomas (1976: 68-71) also postulated this method of attacking big-game herds in the central Great Basin, but included numerous consecu tive ambush stations rather than just one or two ambush stations. It might also be wondered if these areas, presumably the most successful procurement spots, were not actually marked soon after, rather than just before, the kill (Fowler and Fowler 1970). At any rate, once made, whether intentional in this respect or not, the glyphs also may have marked a portion of the subsistence territory of the hunting group. The nearby open sites (10-GG-308, -309, -310) may represent post-hunt camping or even big-game processing. Based on surface indications (basin mortars, ceramics, chipping detritus, and considerable mussel shell), these interpretations seem, however, doubt ful. There appear to be far too few bone scraps for something related to a big-game kill. On the other hand, disturbed areas of some large stratified sites along Briggs Creek contain essentially the same faunal types represented by the 10-GG-307 petro glyphs: deer, mountain sheep, and bison. These sites are also within a few minutes' walking distance of the suggested kill site. If lO-GG-307 does represent the ambush area of a large communal big-game trap, it seems unlikely that this trap could have included bison, deer, and mountain sheep during a single use. Thus, the petroglyph motifs of animals imply at least three uses of a trap, and suggest a long-term involve ment (cf. Thomas 1983:346-347, 350-351). This is also supported by distributional and stylistic differences. Elsewhere, archaeolo gists have suggested that some rock art sites represent considerable periods of time (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; Rusco 1973:9). Age Table 2 presents a variety of site data correlated to give specific age estimates for the six rock art clusters. Although a precise method of determining the age of petro glyphs is not known, some idea of their rel ative ages can be obtained by the presence of lichens, the degree of patination, and/or the degree of weathering on the various panels (Castleton and Madsen 1981:163). Certain recent investigations concerned with cation-ratio dating (measuring the accumula tion of patina) (Dorn and Whitley 1983) have questioned some of the traditional dates as signed to Great Basin rock art styles. How ever, this work does not question the utility of using the aforementioned criteria to es tablish relative chronological sequences for sites. For example, Turner's (1963:14) initial premise that it took from 900 to 1,200 years to form a blue-black patina on glyphs and that a purple-blue-green patina took even longer still seems to have maintained its utility for the relative dating of petroglyph sites in the Glen Canyon region. Thus, pa tina color, relative difference in weathering, and the presence or absence of lichens were used to arrange the six areas chronologic ally. More specific ages were then estimated on the basis of various Great Basin rock art</page><page sequence="16">Table 2 AGE ESTIMATES CORRELATED WITH PANEL CIRCUMSTANCES Agea A.D. 1000 Areab Panels0 Lkhend A.D. 700 or earlier A.D. 1150 A.D. 800 or earlier A.D. 700 or earlier A.D. 800 or earlier A 7 7 C 15 D 11 E 4 F 3 No Considerable No Slight Considerable Slight Patinae Strong brown (75 YR5/6) Brownish-purple (15 YR3/2) Dark yellowish-brown (10 YR4/4) Dark brown (7.5 YR4/4) Brownish-purple (7.5 YR3/2) Dark brown (7.5 YR 4/4) Age estimates are based on Utah rock art studies.

Some studies in Oregon and Washington show that many of the abstract and a few of the less ab stract motifs occur in those regions, while some of the more classic motifs and motif combinations are absent there but occur in southern Idaho and further south and east (Cressman 1937; Nesbitt 1968; Wellmann 1979). A cultural chronology that includes a rock art classification scheme has not yet been developed for the western Snake River region. Areas and E are believed to be of ap proximately similar ages. These panels appear to represent a merging of the Great Basin Curvilinear style (including stick figures, circle chains, curvilinear meanders, and sun discs) with a style more concerned with por traying bison and possible atlatls, and with linear meanders that contain rectilinear, blocky, diamond, and a few triangular de signs (Hedges 1982:207-209). The Great Basin Curvilinear style was assigned a begin ning date of ca. 1000 B.C. in the Great Basin by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:231-233), who also assigned a date of A.D. 1 to the start of the Rectilinear Abstract and Representa tional styles. More recently, studies from the central Great Basin indicate the Recti linear and Scratched styles were in use on portable rock art between 3300 and 1300 B.C. (Thomas 1983). These dates seem to fit with Turner's (1963) assignment of a pre-A.D. 1050 date to early rectilinear forms in the area of Glen and San Juan canyons. Never theless, a date of A.D. 700, or slightly earlier, is preferred for areas and E since the bison motifs and the atlatl styles are well developed and because the scratched application style (uncommon in these parts of the site) is believed to have been widely popular by A.D. 1000 (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; cf. Thomas 1983:346-347,352).3 Except for these two areas, where scratching was used to give relief to the meanders, scratch ing was used mostly to add fine details, such as antlers, horns, headgear, and weapons. It was not used to deface panels (cf. Bettinger and Baumhoff 1982:494). The petroglyphs in areas D and F may be of similar ages. A few rectilinear and curvi linear elements support numerous representa tions, including deer and sheep, weapons, bizarre creatures, anthromorphs, a bird, and a possible rabbit. Turner (1963:6) placed such designs late in his pre-A.D. 1050 style to very early in his A.D. 1050-1250 style. Some obvious affinities with the earlier style include a few rectangular-bodied representa tions (several with disproportionately small extremities and/or heads) and the filling of the body areas on one of these and of two other representations with patterns (not just parallel and vertical cross hatching as in Anasazi art) (Fig. 6f-g). Similarities with the latter style include diamond and trian gular anthromorphs and a few anthromorphs with enlarged appendages and genitals. There are also loose similarities between the one Area D panel (Fig. la) and (1) the Bar rier Canyon anthromorphs who often hold objects of unknown function, and (2) the Classic Vernal anthromorphs of which a final date of A.D. 950 has been proposed (Schaaf sma 1986:225). Based on these criteria, the well-executed pecking technique found on one panel, and the co-occurrence of atlatls and bows, a date of A.D. 800 or slightly earlier is preferred (Castleton 1979:6). Area A fits best with Turner's (1963:6) A.D. 1050-1250 style. Similarities include elaborate headdresses, the bow and arrow co-occurring with a spear or an atlatl, ab ducted thighs on a stick figure, and enlarged</page><page sequence="18">ROCK ART AT THE KANAKA-BRIGGS CREEK LOCALITY 91 appendages and genitals.4 A date of A.D. 1050 or slightly earlier is preferred, which falls within the dating range of the apparent Rosegate projectile point represented at the site (Thomas 1981:19-20; Holmer 1986:106 107; cf. Thomas and Thomas 1972). Area C includes the most recent rock art. Because of the degree of stylistic similarity to Area A and areas D through F, a date of A.D. 1150, or slightly later, is preferred. As in the case with Area A, the bow and arrow is represented and there are enlarged geni tals, outspread and abducted legs, and/or horns on some stick figures. The Area C abstract elements are reminiscent of the Great Basin Curvilinear style, except that the design elements are displayed in an unconnected manner and the meanders have a more rectilinear than curvilinear form. In summary, the rock art in areas A through F includes four styles: Curvilinear, Representational, Rectilinear, and Scratched. Throughout the Great Basin, all four styles apparently were abandoned by A.D. 1500. My interpretation suggests that four to six phases of communal hunting occurred at this site between approximately A.D. 700 and 1150. An evolutionary development from the ambush of bison to deer is suspected, al though the hunting method is believed to be the drive-to-ambush one discussed previously. I believe that at first simple ambushes were sufficient; then, during the time the Area A and/or Area C glyphs were made, the fence may have been constructed to better funnel the prey. If one doubts such an evolution ary modification of the trap, or sees too much stylistic similarity amid the areas, or prefers Thomas' (1976) interpretation of nu merous clusters being used simultaneously, then one period of use from A.D. 700 to 800 and another from A.D. 1050 to 1150 might accommodate most of the motifs. Many motifs are typologically similar to those attributed to one or more of Utah's Fremont cultures (Castleton 1979:6-7; Castleton and Madsen 1981). Schaafsma (1971) defined three styles of Fremont rock art in eastern Utah and two others in west ern Utah, one of the latter being mostly red pictographs. Unfortunately, the state of Fremont archaeology limits comparative statements to 300- to 900-year spans of time, but most of the relevant radiocarbon dates fall within the range suggested for 10 GG-307. The Anasazi and Fremont cultures are known to have co-existed in Utah from approximately A.D. 400 or shortly thereafter to around A.D. 1300 or shortly earlier. Considerable similarity is evident in the rock art of these cultures. The Anasazi people lived in the southern and southeastern parts of the state, and the Fremont lived at various times in the north and midwest parts of Utah (Castleton and Madsen 1981; Lindsay 1986). Classic Fremont rock art previously has been recorded to within 125 km. east of 10-GG-307 (Castleton 1979:17), and there are also Virgin-Kayenta Anasazi styles or Fre mont styles 300 km. to the south in Nevada (Tuohy 1979:17-25). The range assigned to the latter art is A.D. 750 to 1300 (Schaafsma 1986:218), with a dating range of A.D. 1050 to 1300 assigned to the Nevada sites (Tuohy 1979:25). Studies are lacking in the inter vening areas. Cultures Stick figures, and particularly stick figures with abducted arms and thighs, are common in the Anasazi portion of southern Utah (Castleton 1979:137, Fig. 5.72; Castleton and Madsen 1981:170, Fig. 3). These figures sometimes have cross-ended and/or forked hands, not unlike the figures recorded at areas A, C, and D. Occasionally, the Ana sazi stick figures are associated with Fremont /Anasazi anthromorphs who have an</page><page sequence="19">92 JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN ANTHROPOLOGY tennae, with bison or mountain sheep, or with elk or deer headgear like those re corded at areas A, C, and D (Castleton 1979:Figs. 2.13, 5.72, 7.20, 7.121, 1984:Figs. 2.34, 2.98, 2.105, 4.22, 5.112, 6.6, 5.56; Rusco 1973:6-8). While the elaborate shield warriors of Area D might be considered indicative of the Northern San Rafael or Great Salt Lake Fre mont cultures, they embrace a very basic Anasazi/Fremont design (Castleton and Madsen 1981:173; see also Butler 1983a:7-9). A rectangular figure common in western Utah is loosely comparable to the one recorded in Area D (Fig 7a), especially since it displays nearly identical tail and anchor elements. Its large companion expresses a diamond/square body design that might be considered an Archaic/Fremont or even a Sevier/Fremont trait in the area of west central Utah (Castleton 1979:Figs. 2.30, 3.50, 3.52, 4.28, 1984:115, Figs. 3.7, 3.24). Small solidly pecked, horned anthro morphs, such as those occurring in areas A and C, are comparable to Northern San Rafael, Sevier A, and Great Salt Lake Fremont (Castleton 1979:6-7, 1984; Rusco 1973:13, Fig. 2). Horned warriors, especially those with big hands, are only slightly less common at Fremont sites in western and central Utah (e.g., Castleton 1979:Figs. 2.2, 2.33, 2.37, 3.3, 3.53, 3.57, 4.27, 4.40; Rusco 1973:13, Fig. 2). The association of horned anthromorphs with hunting scenes in the San Rafael and Sevier regions suggests that as in the central and western Great Basin areas, petroglyphs are involved with big-game hunting. In general, however, Fremont rock art seems to have been more directly connected with ritual since there is no indication that rock art sites occur at the actual scene of the hunt (Schaafsma 1986:226). Archaeological remains show that big game hunting was an important aspect of the economy of all the Fremont culture variants (Jennings 1978:98, 223). However, it is noteworthy that bison hunting was only im portant in the Great Salt Lake area, in the Fremont variant geographically nearest to the Kanaka-Briggs Creek locality (Butler 1981:250). The procurement of bison in the general region of the Kanaka-Briggs Creek locality has been noted as one of the many similarities between it and sites in the Great Salt Lake region. This similarity also in cludes certain house styles, many elements of the material culture, and a diverse subsis tence economy that includes many plant and animal resources (Butler 1981:250-252; Murphey and Crutchfield 1985:79-80; Mur phey 1985:118-123). Thus, one might expect strong similarities between the rock art. Other than that, the Great Salt Lake rock art also commonly occurs on boulders, and except for the fact that classic Fremont attributes such as the shield warriors and the horned and tailed figures obviously are shared, there is still too little known about either area to make an overall correlation, or to deny its possible existence (see Castleton 1979:16-39). It is interesting that scholars also have pointed out affinities between the material culture of the region about Kanaka Rapids and other Fremont variants, most frequently with the Sevier variant (Plew 1980b:31; Murphey 1985:122). There obviously are many comparisons to be made with the Northern San Rafael, Uinta, and notably the Sevier A rock art traits. However, no single style seems to correlate exactly. The artistic detail of most Fremont rock art does not fit well with the shallow and casual quality of many of the 10-GG-307 motifs. On the other hand, if some or all of these glyphs once were painted, then one might expect a stronger correlation with the Great Salt</page><page sequence="20">ROCK ART AT THE KANAKA-B RIGGS CREEK LOCALITY 93 Lake style (Schaafsma 1971). Even this cor relation would not be a clear-cut one, how ever, since Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:Fig. 31b) also reported a painted style with widespread distribution in the central Great Basin area. The atlatl is a common motif in eastern Utah, but it is also found elsewhere in the Great Basin (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; Castleton and Madsen 1981:172). Likewise, square-bodied mountain sheep, game tracks, deer/elk, hunters with bows and arrows, and simple shield warriors (or figures in circles) are common throughout the Plateau portion of the Anasazi-Fremont area (Castleton and Madsen 1981:173, Table 2D) but these de signs also are found elsewhere in the Desert West (Cressman 1937:49, 61, 63; Butler 1983a: Fig. 1-3; Keyser and Sundstrom 1984: passim). When these motifs occur together with the more diagnostic anthromorphs, they are considered diagnostic of Fremont culture (Castleton 1984:6-7; Rusco 1973). The recti linear meander, stars, and tailed or barbed (anchored) circles are typically found at Fremont sites (e.g., Castleton 1979:Figs. 3.3, 8.37, 8.60, 1984:Figs. 2.26, 2.66, 2.120, 2.148). Many examples from Fremont sites have sun discs, circles, rakes, and even meander snakes; this may simply indicate the mutual influence of the Great Basin Curvilinear and Rectilinear styles (Schaafsma 1971; e.g., Castleton 1979: Figs. 3.1, 4.33, 4.44, 5.18, 5.21, 5.22; Hedges 1982). These basic geo metric designs, very simple stick figures and simple zoomorphs, are very common along the western Snake River near Swan Falls and also occur in great numbers within the neighboring south-central Owyhee Uplands and in the Bennett Hills. These areas are considerable distances to the west, south west, and north-northwest, and they all seem to lack classic Fremont anthromorphs (Plew 1976, 1980b; Ondar 1976; Tobias 1981). On the other hand, current research at two rock art sites in the area to the south seems to reveal even stronger Fremont-like affinities than those recorded for 10-GG-307. The at tributes include large masks painted in two to four colors (red, black, white, and some yellow), wading birds, hawks, plants, shield warriors, and big game. It will be inter esting to see how these patterns develop or become qualified by future field work, espe cially in light of the fact that Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982) suggested that pre-Numic (i.e., pre-Shoshoni) people were largely responsible for the elaborate rock art so widespread in the Great Basin. Problems As noted earlier, the hunting method described here is not reported in Fremont core areas. While this may simply reflect to a degree something which field research has not yet addressed, the current impression is that this hunting technique occurred mostly along the western and southwestern peri pheries of the Fremont area and extended well into the western Great Basin (Schaafsma 1986:220). As in the case with the site and region under consideration here, a Fremont/Anasazi presence, influence, or aspect is often sus pected by those working in this periphery, specifically via the rock art, but also in the material culture inventories of a few hunting and many habitation sites (Schaafsma 1971: 104-108; Rusco 1973:7-9; Tuohy 1979:17-25; Thomas 1983:314-317). Unfortunately, the significance of this evidence is always hard to address: (1) does the evidence indicate Fremont/Anasazi people, perhaps a semi independent local Fremont/Anasazi variant; (2) does it represent another people who had assimilated various Fremont/Anasazi traits through trade or through various cooperative endeavors undertaken with Fremont/Anasazi,</page><page sequence="21">94 JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN ANTHROPOLOGY including perhaps spouse exchanges; and/or (3) does it represent the remnants of Fremont/Anasazi territorial expansion or relocation at specific points in time? Most often, rock art is considered a product of cultures native to the region in which it is found (Castleton 1979:1-8). It is tempting, therefore, to view site 10-GG-307 in terms of a strong Fremont/Anasazi in fluence or in terms of a localized Fremont lifeway. A few Anasazi ceramic items have been recovered from the western Snake River region, including a pendant made from a Virgin Black-on-White sherd with an asso ciated radiocarbon date of 910 ?80 B.P. (Swanson et al. 1964:9, Fig. 16g; Butler 1982:79-80; Murphey 1985:111, Figs. 25, 26). Perhaps these items are the result of an extensive trade network, or are the result of Anasazi contact with some neighboring Fre mont people who were trading and visiting, bringing new ideas into this region. Unfor tunately, this explanation is weakened in that little is known about the nature of Fremont-Anasazi interaction. Likewise, with reference to the rock art, there is still too much discussion about when the various Fre mont traits existed to allow much explana tion of why they were there in the first place. As rock art studies progress, it should become possible to lessen our comparisons with other regions and to define the western Snake River region more on its own terms. The various physiographic locations, motif styles, and motif distributions are so poorly understood and documented at this time that any number of temporal-functional interpre tations seem plausible in specific instances, including some probable variations to and some definite exceptions to the hunting hy pothesis suggested here. There is, for ex ample, good evidence of rock art occurring at what are thought to be sophisticated big game corrals and also near isolated game blinds in both the Owyhee Uplands and the Bennett Hills (Cindar 1976:25-27; Agenbroad 1976:21-22). Moreover, there was ocher staining, possibly a faded red pictograph motif, on the rock face above the Rattle snake Canyon Cremation site further down stream along the Snake River (Bonnichsen 1964). There also are reports of rock art adjacent to camps (Plew 1980b: 135; Butler and Murphey 1982b:Fig. 7g). In the present setting, one cannot help but wonder how, either temporally or cultur ally, the 10-GG-307 rock art might fit with the fishery complex just below. The impres sion has been that this fishery should date substantially younger than anything recov ered during the Kanaka project (presumably it was used by the historic Shoshoni Indians seen by early pioneers) and that it should also date more recently than the youngest age assigned to 10-GG-307. However, since these impressions are based on relic hunters' diggings of historic materials from along the west side of the fishing site and upon the comparative dates assigned to the Kanaka excavations and 10-GG-307, this actually makes a pretty weak argument. That the site represents a big-game trap in which the rock art functioned seems defensible. How ever, one could argue that finding rock art at major fishing sites along the Columbia River is commonplace (Chance and Chance 1982:36-42), so why should not this be the case here? It can be noted that there was a Plateau-level fish procurement technology by at least the Late Prehistoric Period, and that various Plateau groups came here to trade and visit during the Protohistoric and early Historic Periods (Steward 1938:45, 127, 162, 172; Pavesic 1978). It should be noted, however, that the fishing sites located just downstream, including the renowned Upper and Lower Salmon Falls fishing sites, have</page><page sequence="22">ROCK ART AT THE KANAKA-BRIGGS CREEK LOCALITY 95 only one small rock art panel between them. Thus, the hunting interpretation stands. Implications Since a good chronological framework is lacking, there are still many questions about the late prehistory of the study area. For example, the termination date suggested for 10-GG-307 is intriguing. An A.D. 1150 date might approximate or slightly predate the latest Rosegate occupations found at Kanaka Rapids and others found just upstream (But ler and Murphey 1983; Carley and Sapping ton 1982). At the Crutchfield site, down stream in Hagerman Valley, cultural activity ends by approximately A.D. 1300 (620 ?80 B.P.) with growing affinities to the ethno graphic Shoshoni trait list (Murphey and Crutchfield 1985:67, 72-76, 81). Similarly, dating to just after A.D. 1300, with light settlement following a period with numerous Fremont traits and much heavier settlement, Murphey (1985:137-143) found the strongest correlations to the ethnographic Shoshoni lifeway in a drainage located about 40-60 km. southwest of Kanaka Rapids. Although this less intensive settlement is interpreted as evidence of a simple northward shift in the regional settlement pattern, it is less certain how the purported Shoshonean migrations around A.D. 1300 (Lamb 1958; Aikens 1978: 156; Bettinger and Baumhoff 1982) might fit into this scheme, if they do at all (Aikens and Witherspoon 1986). By the same token, it is hard to know just how 10-GG-307 might support a model of regional culture history, including the aspects dealing with the presence or absence of Fremont culture. The Fremont culture elements now attri buted to the western Snake River region are numerous and diverse (Plew 1981:160-163; Butler 1983a, 1983b; Butler and Murphey 1983:33-35; Murphey and Crutchfield 1985: 72-74, 79-80; Murphey 1985:107-123). Given the reports of Fremont and Fremont/Anasazi rock art to the east and south, it seems too much a coincidence that so many Fremont like petroglyphs are located almost adjacent to the Kanaka II house, a Fremont-type structure containing Great Salt Lake Gray pottery sherds and other Fremont traits such as stone balls and Fremont-like projectile points. It is difficult, however, to discount the possibility that such traits could not have developed via contact with Fremont cultures existing to the east. Hence, the Kanaka II site and 10-GG-307 merely add di mensions to a growing body of data that can eventually be brought to bear on the Fre mont aspect of southern Idaho's prehistory (Aikens and Witherspoon 1986:14). NOTES 1. Fish remains were recovered from only two sites in the Kanaka study unit. Trout (Salmo sp.) and minnow or chub (Cyprinidae) were associated with a great number of rabbit bones in a feature including Rose Spring (?) points at 10-GG-278. A few sucker (Catostomus sp.) bones were recovered from a hearth directly in front of the Kanaka II homestead (10-GG-273). No salmon bones (Oncorhynchus sp.) were recovered. 2. Recently reported results of the Baker Cave excavations (Plew et al. 1987) appeared too late to be included in this paper. This site apparently was occupied on at least two occa sions during the past 1,500 years: one temporary use at A.D. 600 to 700, and a primary use at about A.D. 1100. Located about 100 km. northeast of Kanaka Rapids, this site has offered some dry-wall masonry, the remains of 17 bison, several recreational and ceremonial artifacts, Fremont-like projectile points, and various other materials, including a few scraps of what appears to be Shoshoni pottery. This possible association made of Fremont and Shoshoni traits is exciting in terms of the questions raised by the present paper. 3. An earlier date is possible given Holmer's</page><page sequence="23">96 JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN ANTHROPOLOGY (1986:106) suggestion of the bow and arrow replacing the atlatl and dart about A.D. 300-600. On the other hand, a radiocarbon determination (made on a dart foreshaft) of A.D. 1048 can easily make one wonder if the atlatl and dart perhaps remained in use longer than is presently thought (Murphey 1985:111, 231-232). Thomas (1981:30-31) suggested a date of A.D. 600-700 for the introduction of the bow and arrow in the Great Basin. 4. Some visitors to the site have doubted that this "spear or atlatl" is either. They believe it to be an item of a religious or sym bolic function. This, of course, would make the area f?t a little better in terms of when most believe the atlatl and dart had been replaced by the bow and arrow.
