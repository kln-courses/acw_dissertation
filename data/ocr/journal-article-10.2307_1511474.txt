They become gradually more explicit as one is forced by circum- stances to make choices about a career, how to work with a client, and how to deal with the possibilities and limitations of a new design situation. These three books, so different in theme and style, vividly demonstrate the extent to which philosophic beliefs shape design thinking and practice. They give a glimpse of the pluralism of beliefs in the contem- porary design community and perhaps some ideas about where design may be moving in the future. In The Materials of Invention, Ezio Manzini describes the remarkable new materials that are available to designers today because of advances in technology. He discusses the new plastics, metals, and composites in a manner well-suited to the curiosity of the designer, student, and general reader. Even engineers will find the book useful because of the interface it creates between materials science and design application. But this book is also an attempt to formulate a new philosophy of design, and it should be read carefully from this perspective. Manzini does not use the term philosophy. He wants to provide a new model of possibility that will enable designers to work more effectively in the changed material and cultural circumstances of the contemporary world. The model one creates of the possible, he shrewdly observes, is a part of creativity itself. In this case, however, philosophy and model are nearly synonymous and, for the moment, will be treated as such. Despite an unusual style and narrative manner, Manzini presents the familiar posture of a classic materialist. He believes that matter is the funda- mental reality of our world and that everything we experience can be explained in terms of combin- ations and constructions of matter. "Our gaze runs over the objects of our everyday existence. They are forms endowed with qualities; the qualities are the product of the materials." For Manzini, artifice is technical interference with nature. He does not see the artificial as essentially different from the natural. In this respect, he seems unaware of his differences with Herbert Simon, though he cites Simon approvingly and may mistakenly think he is elabor- ating a Simon-like theory of design. For Simon, artificial objects are essentially different from and not reducible to the natural: "We have now identified four indicia that distin- guish the artificial from the natural; hence we can set the boundaries for sciences of the artificial" (The Science of the Artificial, p. 5). The significance of Simon's position is this: by arguing that the artificial possesses a reality of its own, he can show that engineering is a true design science and not a derivative of an "applied" version of natural science. Manzini, too, wants to make this alliance because he comments that materials research is increasingly a design activity. Yet, his arguments should be read carefully. What he is actually arguing is very nearly a reduction of design to applied science, though this is significantly mitigated by his view of design methods and the principles of design, as will be shown. Manzini's philosophy of design is developed through an inquiry into the nature of matter and possibility in the modem world. The problem for inquiry is well-conceived. Because of our vastly increased ability to manipulate and manage the complexities of matter, the level of technical interference with nature has deepened, in effect pushing the natural foundation of matter much further down than at any time in the past. As a consequence, we are increasingly distanced from the physicality of materials. A major part of our world seems to have become immaterial, in the sense that we no longer have the immediate physical references that once gave weight and depth of understanding to experience. As Manzini says, "weighty" meanings have been transformed into "light" recognitions. The distance from physicality is most evident in computer simulations, in which almost all aspects of reality are experienced except physical presence. With computers, video, and photographs, we are dealing with deferred images. "In these new objects, game and function intermingle in ways never experienced before; and - more interesting still - their true form, that is the image that they impress in our minds, does not correspond to their actual physical form, but rather to the form of the system of relations which they imply." In the immateriality of the deferred image we experience matter as 78</page><page sequence="2">information about systems of relations, not about physicality. However, it is not just simulations that concern Manzini. "A world of nameless materials is taking shape. These materials create a crisis in the traditional relationship that we once had with materials, and they prevent us from attributing to them meanings that once endowed them with cultural and physical depth." Instead of viewing objects in terms of their simple natural properties and accumulated cultural meanings, our reference is to performance and novel evocative images. Users can no longer predict the properties and meanings of objects; they must continually test objects in order to discover the properties and possibilities placed there by design. Rather than overturn the materialist perspective, as Simon and Dewey have, Manzini recovers materialism in a shrewdly reformulated hypothesis which is a key to his philosophy of design. "The 'material' of which objects are made therefore appears increasingly difficult to define in simple categories that we can say have been acquired once and for all. The only way to describe the materials [sic] is to consider it as a system capable of performance: thus we shall speak of a 'material,' not by defining 'what it is,' but by describing 'what it does."' This is an interesting way to resolve the dilemma of materiality and immateriality, but the subtle difference between Manzini and Simon should be noted again. Simon (and more sharply, Dewey) argues that raw materials are transformed into design materials precisely by the role they come to play in the artificial object. In contrast, Manzini sees the transformation of matter into design material as a techno-scientific manipulation of nature, opening possibilities for the subsequent use of new materials in design because of their new performance properties. So similar in appearance, so far apart in implication! Manzini formulates what we may call a non- materialist method and a non-materialistprinciple in order to deal with the experience of a reality whose properties are no longer easily reduced to underlying natural laws. Such laws exist, else matter could not be manipulated so profoundly. Yet, the natural and cultural history of materials - the continuity of meanings that are part of collective memory - has been broken. "[M]atter no longer appears to the scale of our perception as a series of given materials, but rather as a continuum of possibilities." The designer can no longer rely on a method of construction that combines and integrates natural properties in a designed object. He or she must employ an operational method that emphasizes perspectives on the performance possibilities of materials. There are two methodological instru- ments. The first is a macroscope: it enables the designer to observe modern technological culture from a broad perspective, identifying models of thought that may be useful in helping to deal inventively with the possibilities of materials. The second is a microscope: it enables the designer to take a progressively more detailed perspective on how things work, in effect helping the designer to apply a model in practice. The macroscope and microscope are not opposed as dialectical contraries. Rather, they are instru- ments of invention, the mental tools by which the individual designer's perspective is formed and projected into the world. They are, in fact, a form of the "common" and "proper" topics of rhetorical invention, adapted to a material reality. The importance of rhetoric for Manzini is evident in the way he makes communication and language central to his design method, elaborating with insight about the way in which problems of invention and presentation lie at the heart of design practice. Yet, he shows little awareness of the intellectual roots of this methodology, and his method suffers a corres- ponding degree of imprecision. If he is aware, he probably knows rhetoric through semiotics, where it is treated as discourse pragmatics, or perhaps through speech act theory, where it is treated as a perlocutionary act. In either case, it is merely a rhetoric of rules. Consider Manzini's treatment of that common- place of design methodology: DESIGN AS PROB- LEM SOLVING. It is true, he says, that problem setting and problem solving are the two aspects of all design. However, the simplified linear outline of the design process (what we may call a logistic rather than an operational sequence, to distinguish Man- zini's method) is far from actual practice. The designer moves in a complex social web, where individuals speak specialized languages derived from their areas of knowledge and technical expertise. They also hold diverse cultural or intellectual perspectives (regarded by Manzini as models) that strongly affect how they see (or fail to see) a design situation. The task for the designer is to find a way to integrate or even bypass these perspectives, creating a new model that will animate the design team, the client, and, ultimately, the user. True enough. But without more precise methodological tools, all that Manzini can say is that problem setting "always originates from a mental image, a metaphor capable of generating other images and, thereafter, actions, interactions among individuals, and action upon matter." One source of precision may lie in the set of categories that Manzini uses to explore the per- Design Issues: Vol. VII, Number 1 Fall 1990 79</page><page sequence="3">formance qualities of new materials. These cate- gories (the transparent, the elastic and pliable, and so forth) are elaborated in the bulk of the book and provide the basis for interesting and wide ranging discussions. But are they really categories? Perhaps not. They may be better described as topics: places of invention that help the designer find a new mental image or generative metaphor. If this is what Manzini means-and there is good reason to think so-then perhaps he has begun to give precision to the microscope. However, he will also have to elaborate a comparable set of topics for the macroscope if his concept of the generative metaphor is to fulfill its intended role in design. The generative metaphor is the principle of design. It represents "the appearance of an idea that is simple but endowed with the ability to create a synthesis of many complex elements." It is, in fact, a reflexive principle, in the sense that it sets the design problem and also sets the design solution. The metaphor is the principle of the potential whole object, expressed in its simplest form, awaiting elaboration through design activities. It provides the rules of a system of relations that constitute the design object. With such a principle in mind, it is not difficult to see that design, for Manzini, reflects the way in which human beings separated themselves from the material world, achieving a thinking self that is different from "the matter upon which that self operates." The designed object is an expression of the self and, presumably, functions for users as an elaboration of their own selfhood. Such a principle also implies diversity in society and pluralism in design practice. "The idea of design that takes shape here is certainly less monolithic than we had believed in the past. The great overall game indeed is articulated as a number of different games, each with its own rules and players." This is not a strikingly original philosophy of design. Many of the ideas simply reflect current semiotic, structuralist, and postmodernist attitudes. (Indeed, an astute reader may notice with a shock that Manzini has rediscovered a weak form of George Campbell's eighteenth-century philosophy of rhetoric, applied now to a new subject matter.) But the book makes a contribution to our under- standing of the field by elaborating a defensible position on the three fundamental issues that must be addressed in any design theory: the subject matter, methods, and principles of design. Most important, Manzini develops this position through an inquiry into a problem that we all may recognize, and his work suggests directions for further inquiry. Deeper criticisms would come from an alternative view of the problem, not from a failure on Manzini's part to carry out the task he sought to accomplish. As a teacher at the Domus Academy, Ezio Manzini is perhaps comfortably positioned within the institutional and professional framework of the design community. His philosophic position poses no conflict with such a role. Gaetano Pesce, on the other hand, seems to relish the role of an outsider. His submissions to major architectural competi- tions, for example, often purposely violate an- nounced ground rules. And he pays the price in marginality, though it is not a price he seems to mind. By his persistence he seems to be saying that it is the members of the design community who are, too often, marginal to the inner life of the human beings they profess to serve. Gaetano Pesce: Architecture Design Art offers probably the most complete catalog of Pesce's projects and works to date, with appropriate scholarly apparatus to help guide further research. France Vanlaethem provides enabling texts for the catalog entries, as well as a useful introductory essay that traces the picaresque career of Pesce and his place in Italian and international circles. In addition, Michael Sorkin, who seems to be establishing a second career writing prefaces to art books, wrote the preface to this book: "Footnotes to the Work of Gaetano Pesce." The preface is just that, a series of twenty footnotes with no accompanying text. Pesce's life and works, presumably, are the text. What is one to do with Gaetano Pesce? Vanlaethem's essay places him, after some strug- gle, in the context of the Dadaists, Surrealists, and metaphysical painters. In the terms used to describe Manzini's philosophy, it might said that Pesce, too, is a materialist, in the sense that reality for him lies beneath conventional appearances. But unlike Manzini, Pesce is less confident that knowledge of material nature creates bright possibilities: he addresses the dark unconscious of the mind, seeking expression of an inner life that does not yield to modern techno-science and resists the rational methods we attempt to employ in conscious life. Indeed, Pesce's view of design method is found precisely in his willingness to accept the seemingly irrational inconsistency of subjective moods and impulses. He allows "inconsistency" to break into the cognitive logic of design thinking, where it individuates and personalizes the design object. Pesce does not find the principle of design in a unified whole, which harmonizes parts so that they can serve purely utilitarian ends. His principle lies in the power and provocation of the part, the impulse drawn from inner life that wells up in some figurative or symbolic feature of the final object to tell a fragmented narrative. Indeed, his objects are often theatrical gestures or fragmentary assemblages, 80</page><page sequence="4">one-off pieces, or unique deviations from serial production that seem to be the antithesis of the planned. What he gains is an elusive yet compelling meaning added to function: a cultural artifact that is a hieroglyph of mysterious inner life. It is obvious that Pesce's works do not move an observer to detached reflection. They seem to come out of the primitive unconscious. Sexual but seldom erotic; narrative; filled with historical and religious references, body references, occasional terror, and frequent playful humor: Pesce's objects achieve a singularity of being that no other Nuovo design can (or perhaps would want) to match. His "Garden Chair in Rubber" may be one of the most grotesque chair designs ever. But his "Wan-Chai" chair is strikingly beautiful. What is one to do with Gaetano Pesce? Vanlaethem's book brings Pesce to a wider audience. The intense dialogue with design that Pesce has been conducting through his projects and works for many years is not over. Before establishing a successful architecture and design practice, Emilio Ambasz was known as the Museum of Moder Art's (MOMA) design curator who organized the landmark exhibition "Italy: The New Domestic Landscape." The title of this 1972 exhibit is a clue to the philosophic reorientation that marks Ambasz's own view of design in the contemporary world. As he wrote at the time, "the object (from the spoon to the city) is no longer conceived as an isolated entity, sufficient unto itself, but rather as an integral part of the larger natural and sociocultural environment." In Emilio Ambasz: The Poetics of the Pragmatic, Ambasz has, in a sense, designed a new exhibition in which the earlier premise is developed personally through his own varied works in architectural, exhibit, industrial, and graphic design. The challenge for a reader is this: to move beyond the ambiguities of the original premise as it was explored in the MOMA exhibit (and subsequently developed in conflicting directions by many other designers and critics) and to discover what it has come to mean for Ambasz himself in terms of specific products and a philosophy of design. Unlike Manzini and Pesce, Ambasz makes no commitment to the nature of reality. He prefers to explore the sensuous beauty of perception. Indeed, the subject matter of design for Ambasz is the variety and richness of our perceptions of reality, whatever we may think reality to be. Ettore Sottsass, who wrote one of the four prefatory essays of the book (Mario Bellini, Alessandro Mendini, and, yes, Michael Sorkin wrote the other three), grasps this at once: "I believe that such a quest for a constant state of fluidity, such a perception of existence as an ever-changing process pervades everything that Emilio has ever designed." If the term existential was not overburdened by the meaning it has held for the French, it would probably serve well to capture Ambasz's attitude: he focuses on radically personal existence. This is evident in specific design situations. Ambasz shows remarkable respect for the immediate flux of the user's feelings about the body and surroundings. He regards the creative working individual as someone who is alive in many dimensions: "I hold that the real tasks begin once functional and behavioral needs have been satisfied. It is not hunger, but love and fear, and sometimes wonder, that make us creative." Such a view leads to the persistent sense of elegance and beauty that distinguishes Ambasz's creations. Consider his celebrated "Vertebra" chair. Others describe it in terms of ergonomics, an ambiguous concept in the design community that is sometimes reduced to a materialist science of body mechanics. Ambasz describes the chair in a subtly different way, retaining the existential dimension: "I was deeply concerned with creating an anthropomorphic and anthropofunctional object that accompanies the movement of the body completely and unself- consciously, just as a glove moves with the hand that wears it. The chair was conceived as an extension of the body." Though he says he would probably change the visual appearance of the "Vertebra" today to accommodate prevailing stylistic interests, it would no doubt retain a quality of elegance suited to lift the user beyond a state of simple physical existence. Referring to his work in architecture, he says, "I seek to develop an architectural vocabulary outside the canonical tradition of architecture. It is an architecture that is both here and not here. With it I hope to place the user in a new state of existence, a celebration of human majesty, thought, and sensation." Ambasz's method, however, is best characterized as disciplinary concentration on the problematics of each design situation: "I like to think that I have trained myself in a discipline for concentrating on the principle of the problem, thereby getting rid of all extraneous elements." The method is obviously analytical, whether the object is a chair or a building. Note this perceptive description by Michael Sorkin: "The Vertebra chair, for example, is distinguished from its innumerable kith by the way in which it efficiently identifies and solves one of the few abiding problematics of ergonomic chair design: the structural integration of seat, back, and arms. Vertebra uses the arms as the structural link between seat and back, eliminating the most generically irritating redunduncy [sic] in office chair Design Issues: Vol. VII, Number 1 Fall 1990 81</page><page sequence="5">design. The success of the product is not simply in solving the issue of sitting, but in a shrewd vision of just the relevant question of elegance." But the existential subject matter and pragmatic method are not enough to account for the unique quality of Ambasz's work. One must consider the unusual principle he embodies (discovers?) in every object, suggesting an almost religious sanctity of the land and the places where human beings carry out their daily lives. Ambasz begins his excellent introductory essay, "I Ask Myself," in this way: "It has always been my deep belief that architecture and design are both myth-making acts." It is the task of the architect and designer "to give poetic form to the pragmatic." For Ambasz, poetic form is a principle of struc- turing. But the structure of an object, whether a small domestic convenience or a building or an ensemble of buildings, echoes the relation of two realms of being. In one of his "Working Fables," several of which are included in this book, he says: "The realm of ideas and the material realm come together and interact at the level of structures. A structure attempts to materialize an idea and to idealize a material. It is designed to reconcile the discordant interface between superstructure and infrastructure." In a sense, therefore, the structured object is a kind of fable or myth of a more comprehensive whole than we can entirely grasp in everyday life, a whole which is far more encompas- sing than the local system of relations that Ezio Manzini's generative metaphor is intended to express. Ambasz insists, however, that he is not interested in utopian visions. He looks only for the rituals and ceremonies in everyday existence, observing that it would be "a tragedy to discover that for the sake of such long-term dreams we have sacrificed our daily lives." To see this philosophy of design embodied in everyday objects that do, indeed, have the quality of a fable, is a pleasure. To see it worked out in such a wide range of objects, including an automobile engine designed for Cummins Engine, turns Ambasz himself into something of a fable. I Ad 82</page></plain_text>
