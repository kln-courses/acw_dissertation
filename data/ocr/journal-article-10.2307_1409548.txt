<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Translating Magical Texts Alan Kilpatrick I am going to offer a few thoughts on translating magical texts, whether they are authored by Cherokees, Aztecs, or ancient Egyptians. To begin with, I should state that as forms of human expression, magical texts are one of the most resistant to formal translation simply because they are forms of cryptography that were never meant to be decoded. They are secretive documents written in a highly specialized vocabulary, replete with arcane forms of word play, meant to baffle and confuse the uninitiated, the layman. In addition, they invoke ideas and images that are, for the most part, outside of our normal, ordinary world experience. PROCESS I want to focus my attention on translation not as the final product but as the activity itself. For everything transpires from our first crucial, ex- istential encounter with the text: mystified, we ignore it; intrigued, we I move toward it. If we accept what it seems to promise, then we enter E 25 into a cumulative, dialectic process that may take weeks, months, or years as we expend time and energy formulating our ideas, retooling our interpretive powers. Over time, we discover the patterns or the patterns discover us, and we're finally able to say this means "that," whatever "that" means. Before we translators pat ourselves on the back though, I think</page><page sequence="2">we have to recognize that whatever success we ultimately enjoy, we owe to our predecessors. When Griffith and Thompson came to pub- lish their version of the Leyden Papyrus in 1904 (a compilation of Egyp- tian magical incantations recorded in the demotic script of the third century A.D.), they were just part of a long tradition of Egyptologists including Reuvens, Leemans, and Bruge, who had worked on these eso- teric materials for over seventy years. When Ruiz de Alarc6n published his Tratado de las Supersticiones de los Naturales de esta Nueva Espana in 1629 (109 folio pages of Nahua spells copied by five different sets of hands and then framed by Ruiz de Alarc6n's own commentary), his narrative was made possible by the illuminatory efforts of those sixteenth-century missionaries, Fray Sahagun and Fray Duran, who had already written our foremost ethno- graphic accounts of the religion of the Mexica-Aztec. Finally, I, too, owe a great debt to my forbears. Almost every- thing we modern scholars know about the occult world of the Chero- kee comes from two primary sources: James Mooney's classic work on the Eastern Cherokee, The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees, published in 1891, and my own late parent's work on the Western Cherokee, Run toward the Nightland, published in 1967. Of course, translation is only possible if there exists an equiva- lent epistomelogical category into which we can wrestle these foreign words and concepts. Sometimes they fit and sometimes they don't. During this transactional process, often our ego is the first casualty be- cause sooner or later we simply have to admit to ourselves or, worse yet, to someone else that we really don't know what all the words mean. If we're honest, then question marks will appear interspersed through- out our interlinear notes. To their credit, Griffith and Thompson inserted many such ex- pressions of puzzlement in the Leyden Papyrus. The hieroglyphic sym- bols of the griffin, the eye, and the kneeling warrior-did they connote an evil dream or something else entirely? w Is the iztac cihuatl nonan, "white woman, my mother," variously in- voked in Nahua spells to alleviate skin rashes or to staunch blood issu- ing from the mouth, a reference to the natural elements of copal or salt as Ruiz de Alarc6n originally thought, or is it a ritualism for Huixto- chihuat, the Salt Goddess herself, who was intimately connected with the life-giving fluid water? Who really knows? 26 In my own humble effort, The Night Has a Naked Soul, with the help of a coterie of full-blood traditionalists, I translated about forty Cherokee medico-magical texts, or idi:gaawe:sdi. There were troublesome words throughout, such as archaisms like Qwatloya, which from its po- sition in the text seemed to be an avian deity of some unknown origin, an orphaned being now, for no one had invoked its name in over a hun- dred years.</page><page sequence="3">Sometimes we came across a text that was not in any standard- ized format and consisted of only one or two words. In one such case, the medicine man who originally dictated the formula (a kindly old curer named Uwodige'Gigage:i or Brown Red) didn't know what the words actually meant either. He only knew that the words were old and pow- erful and had to be spoken exactly that way. At a reception, I asked a Mayan epigrapher, renowned for his de- cipherment of the hieroglyphics, how hopeful he was that they would completely unravel the dynastic chronicles embedded in the inscrip- tions on the ancient stelae. With tempered optimism, he estimated that over the next few decades they would get about 75 percent. But then he glumly added that he didn't think they would ever get it all. Given that we sometimes fail, why do we continue to translate? Probably because there is a fundamental human part of us that seeks to- tality or resolution-the Aristotelian classical unity of time and space, the happy ending if you will. Somehow that live wire left dangling in the air, the incomplete, fragmentary part of human existence, is trouble- some to our psyche. Another reason, perhaps more vital, is that we in- tuitively know that if we undergo this rigorous, sometimes torturous intellectual challenge, we become more empowered by these strange words from this remote place in time. CONTEXT Unless we are the author, we often find that the context surround- ing the creation of the text is missing, sometimes by hundreds of years. In the face of this uncertainty, how much meaning can we safely extrapolate? It is certain that neither the Egyptologists nor Ruiz de Alarc6n, the Franciscan Zealot, believed in the magical traditions that they sought to unearth. No doubt, if pressed to answer about their own emotional connection to these ancient religions, Griffith, Thompson, and Ruiz de Alarc6n would have glibly remarked (along the lines of the E modern archaeologist, Colin Renfrew): "I study at the temple but I &gt; don't worship there." Should I then be comforted or confounded by the fact that I was born into that charmed circle of believers? Is my situation improved by the fact that, as a child, I knew some of the folk healers whose very texts I translated? Not only knew them, but in some cases, I was di- B 27 rectly descended from them. Is my situation somehow better because close relatives of mine still fervently believe in the power of magic and the threatening specter of witches? The ring I wear is both a testament and a contradiction to all of this. It is a Zuni ring, a curious turtle, given to me by my mother over twenty years ago. "Wear it," she said, "for good luck and a long life." I</page><page sequence="4">still wear it today, although more out of regard for her than for the be- liefs behind it. Her life was not particularly lucky or long, but who am I to say that turtles do not have magical power? CONTENT If translation involves not only the "rendering of one language into an- other," but also "a change to a different substance, form, or appearance: conversion" (Websters Dictionary, 1241), then are we not speaking of a process similar to magic whose very purpose is to transmute? Surely the translator is part magician as he or she fashions not only equivalent words or ideas but also concretizes world experiences that link us to- gether symbolically as cognitive human beings. All collections of magic contain divining methods, erotic spells, protective charms, and purificatory rites. Yet curiously, despite a con- stellation of possibilities, all three of these magical texts-the Egyptian papyrus, the Nahua treatise, and my Cherokee idi:gawe:sdi-feature a spell to induce catalepsy, sleep paralysis, in a victim: diga:dhli?dhadi:sdi:yi' (to put them to sleep, one). The phenomenon of the night terror (waking up in a semi- conscious state, gripped by fear and unable to move, as if weighed down by some unseen, menacing force) seems to be a primordial fear, universally known. Who among us has not experienced some form of this nightmarish state? This nocturnal phenomenon is intimately linked in my mind to the succubus folklore and recalls Nutini and Roberts' recent ethno- graphic accounts of the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi, the blood-sucking witch who, under a variety of names and shapes, haunts the mountain villages of Morelia and Oaxaca, using her extraordinary powers to anesthetize and immobilize the sleeping inhabitants and, in this helpless state, sucks the life force from their children. Thus, as divergent as are their morphologies and phonetics, what binds together the pre-Coptic priest along the Nile, the Aztec ticitl, and the Cherokee dida:hhvwi:sgi is their access to that intuitive compendium of human fears and anxieties, as well as an incurable belief in the mythology of human will. ATTITUDE 28 B How do the changing intellectual fashions of the day affect our read- ing of the text? At one end of the scale, we have Griffith and Thomp- son, whose translations exude the authoritarian, clinical tone of the Victorian Age. For them I think the Leyden Papyrus was a static narrative of a timeless consciousness. So their translation was an act of restora- tion or conservation, placing the ancient words back into their correct order, reinforcing a stable hierarchy of classical values.</page><page sequence="5">In Ruiz de Alarc6n, we are confronted by the translator as de- constructionist. In his commentaries, he cites "the ignorance or simple- mindedness of almost all of the Indians" (Coe and Whittaker, 63) and further writes, "It is not my purpose in this work to conduct a meticu- lous investigation of [their] customs .... I only aspire to open a path for the ministers to the Indians, so that both jurisdictions can easily acquire a knowledge of this corruption, and so that they can better attempt its correction, if not its remedy" (Coe and Whittaker, 61). Throughout his narrative, we hear the mocking righteousness of Ruiz de Alarc6n's voice, who is there to marginalize and condemn these indios from the villages of Morelos and northern Guerrero and to contradict the wick- edness of their idolatrous ideas. Finally, in my own work, we encounter the angst and self- questioning of the scholar who senses that meaning is no longer the still point in the turning world; it has become unmoored and floats on a sea of relativity, suspended now in the vacuum of cyberspace. Recently, I attended an ethnohistory conference in Mexico City. One of my old mentors from the University of California, Los Angeles was there pon- tificating about the Aztec images of the veintana or sacred monthly cer- emonies. He demonstrated through painstaking, iconographic analysis that these venerable images had became rather standardized during the early colonial period. The old exuberance was in my mentor's voice, and it was reassuring to hear that he was able to make the ancient texts "speak" once again, as he had so often in the classroom. His talk, however, was followed by a younger scholar, a genera- tion removed, who, infused with postmodernist angst, invoked Mircea Eliade's "the opacity of the sacred," proclaiming texts as intellectual quicksand, or worst yet, a reflecting, refracting prism by which we superimpose our own prejudices on the Other. The chasm, the gap, he argued, is too great for us in the modern age to intellectually bridge even with our arsenal of human strengths: humility and patience, imag- ination, and creativity. Well, there was a great silence in the audience, as if an enormous existential void had opened up and swallowed all of us, leaving in its wake only those deictic pillars of here and there, re- &gt; minding us again of the age-old distance between subject and object, ethnographer and informant, reader and text. 0 N CONCLUSION u S 29 I realize that I've woven a narrative of misgivings here. Let me try to a splice together some contradictory but frail strands of optimism. It is true that there is only a handful of people on the planet that can really make sense of these magical texts. Many of these manuscripts lie un- used or unusable in libraries or museums, under glass captured with other specimens, to our modern eyes a curiosity at best.</page><page sequence="6">If secretive worlds are so profoundly alien and difficult to negoti- ate, why should we waste our time studying them? After all, maybe magic is, as Freud thought, nothing more than an illusory, compen- satory fantasy that we share with others on our planet about our es- sential powerlessness and helplessness over our own life cycles (cf. Schafer, 14). The best answer comes from examining the process itself, as I have tried to do here. For me, the value of studying magical texts lies in the fact that they illuminate that inner-world phenomenon, the subjec- tive experience, the psychic reality of dreams and desires that connect us all as human beings. Besides, occasionally (in contradiction to my younger colleagues), intuitively or intellectually, we translators know that we've got these exaltative, slippery words right. They resonate in some nascent cavity of our body or soul, and we know, in that rare moment, that this must be what was originally intended so long ago. And it is these small dis- coveries that make the whole process worthwhile and keep me, at least, working in this esoteric realm of the human mind. Finally, I want to say that I'm pleased and privileged to be voicing these very thoughts within walking distance of the Yale Beinecke Li- brary that has been, for over twenty years now, the principal repository for my late parent's manuscripts on Cherokee medicine and magic. It is my fervent hope that future generations of scholars will transcend my own concerns, use these invaluable texts as I have tried to do, and grace us with new and better translations of these ancient and mysterious words.
