ISBN 978-0-87081-815-8 Reviewed by Manish Chalana India is home to as many people - and as many languages, cultures, and religions - as all of Europe put together. These cultures, shaped heavily by Hinduism and its offshoots, im- bue symbolic meaning into all aspects of life and the material world, including the landscape. While predominantly a rural country, India is also one of the world's most rapidly indus- trializing societies, undergoing an unprecedented scale of change in the built environment. Landscape in India is thus a vast, diverse, complex, and evolving topic that holds great potential for scholars in landscape studies. However, it is also a topic that has received relatively little attention in the West. Amita Sinha's wide-ranging book Landscapes in India: Forms and Meanings represents a major step toward bridging this gap. The work is divided into four parts (and thirteen chap- ters), generally proceeding from the theoretical to the practi- cal. In Part 1, Sinha introduces the underlying premises which form the core of her approach to understanding Indian land- scapes. Hinduism and Buddhism interpret the land in a fun- damentally transcendentalist way, perceiving of it first and foremost as a realm of sacred meaning. This view of the land runs so deep that it manifests itself in the Indian mind as a set of nature-based Jungian archetypes, which form the language used in Indian architectural and landscape design. Parallel- ing these "natural archetypes" are a set of "spatial archetypes" which underlie the ways in which Indians perceive of and or- ganize space at all levels. In the second part, comprising the bulk of the book, Sinha elucidates her theory of natural archetypes by examin- ing the landscapes of some of the country's most prominent pilgrimage sites, where landscape symbolism is at its richest. She explores the grand epic Ramayana in great depth, using her concept of natural archetype to link the nature themes running through the ancient epic to landscape elements in the modern-day town of Ayodhya, birthplace of the god Rama, the epic's hero. For example, one archetype she explores is the river-mountain dyad, which Ayodhya shares with other holy cities in India, and which, in Hindu landscapés, acts as a marker for the axis mundi, or crossing between heaven and Earth. In subsequent chapters, Sinha carries out similar explo- rations for the cultural zone of Braj (associated with Krishna, God incarnate and the hero of the epic Mahabharatà), Pav- agadh (associated with the Mother Goddess Devi), as well as a variety of landscapes associated with Siddharta Gautama, the Buddha. In the third part of the book, Sinha switches focus to the spatial archetypes, exploring the role that these conceptual building blocks play in the organization of space both within Book Reviews 321</page><page sequence="2">individuai dwellings and at the level of whole settlements. She gives special attention to the vaastu purusha mandala - an anthropomorphic form in a recursively divided square with his head in the northeast. Considered by Hindus to symbol- ize a microcosm of the universe, Sinha argues that the vaastu purusha mandala plays an even wider role in shaping Indian use of space than is generally acknowledged, finding evidence of this organization at a range of scales from dwelling to neigh- borhood, village and city. She illustrates her point by exploring communities in regions throughout India, detailing the caste- determined spatial hierarchies and clan groupings, as well as the layout of individual courtyard dwellings, the dominant pre-industrial housing prototype. With the book's final part, Sinha translates her ideas into cultural landscape management using a variety of case studies. These include the historic religious centers of Sar- nath and Champ aner-Pavagadh for which Sinha and her col- leagues at the University of Illinois have developed heritage management plans. She emphasizes the role that sacred sites (especially temples) have played in environmental conserva- tion and education generally, and argues that a sustainable environmental movement in India ought to be grounded in local faith and belief systems - what she refers to as "god- dess ecology." She calls for contemporary Indian design and planning to be informed by natural and spatial archetypes grounded in indigenous models such as vaastu purusha mandala for greater efficacy and continuity in the built envi- ronment. While this idea may be familiar to scholars in other regions or disciplines, it is nevertheless of great value to be given clear and well researched examples of how indigenous models of landscape planning could be applied to the Indian landscape. Sinha concludes with an exploration of works by contemporary design professionals in India including scions such as Charles Correa, Joseph Allen Stein, Raj Rewal, and Balkrishna Doshi. In spite of what may be implied by its broad reaching title, Landscapes in India: Forms and Meanings is not intended as a comprehensive treatment of the full range of India's land- scape traditions. The book does not document or explain Is- lamic, Sikh, or Christian approaches to landscapes in India, nor does it cover the full geographic diversity of the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Sinha is clear to point out these limita- tions herself in the introduction. A few additional limitations should be highlighted for this otherwise well- crafted work. The materials used in developing all but two chapters have been previously published as journal articles, and the book reflects this at times with issues of continuity, balance, and repetition. In addition, even with a four page glossary, her generous use of terminology from Sanskrit may be difficult for newcomers (but useful for many as well). Her references to Jungian psy- chology, especially the concept of the "collective unconscious" as the reservoir of archetypes, may seem outmoded to some; however the basic point which she derives from this concept is unassailable - that Hindu and Buddhist conceptions of land- scape are deeply symbolic and derived from a conception of nature as divine. Despite these possible concerns; Sinha has provided a thorough, broad, and accessible introduction to the cultural symbolism that pervades Hindu and Buddhist landscapes in India. Her use of disparate Indian and Western sources, and her intimate familiarity with Indian landscapes, give the work a solid, grounded feeling. By introducing a series of case stud- ies on the use of heritage management of sacred landscapes, Sinha ensures her work is not only interesting from an aca- demic standpoint, but has a strong relevance for practice as well. Scholars, in whatever part of the world, who seek an in- troduction to the complex topic of Indian cultural landscapes and the symbolic traditions upon which they are based, will find no better guide than Landscapes in India : Forms and Meanings.
