<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 387 scientific literature that would render such women pas- sive, without history or agency-the subject of chapter 4-Rodriguez argues that they find empowerment, spiri- tual and ultimately social, in their experience of the sym- bol. Her rich data, derived from interviews, survey ques- tions, and observation, clearly support her, and her reflexive voice is softly present in all of this. But all is not praise, for as she takes this empowering empirically based stance on behalf of these women, she misses an opportunity to take on another related kind of discussion that is much of the moment, more controver- sial, and one that would have richly amplified the range of this book. I refer to the ongoing cultural process among some elite Chicana feminists to deconstruct and decenter la Virgen de Guadalupe whom they see, in its traditional iconic image, as an expression of patriarchy promoting matemalized passivity among mexicanas. Perhaps the foremost of such critics is the artist Yolanda Lopez, who in her "Guadalupe Series" offers us images on paper of a "Guadalupe" jogging, breast-feeding a baby, and so forth, overriding the traditional image. Another Chicana femi- nist and supporting critic, Angie Chabram Demersian, says of Lopez: "By relegating the notably artificial, statu- esque portrait of the Chicana/Mexicana Virgen to the bottom of the page, Lopez discards this image as a viable one for contemporary Chicanas/Mexicanas and she in- vites the reformulation and/or displacement of this reified female icon by new images, inspired in everyday work and play." (In de la Torre and Pesquera, Building with Our Hands, University of Califomnia Press, 1993, p. 43). What would Rodriguez and her everyday women in- formants say to this process of discarding, displacement, and reformulation of the traditional la Virgen de Guadalupe that they find so empowering? One can even imagine asking her informants to respond to Lopez's paintings. How do these seemingly divergent perspectives articulate with those of yet another Chicana feminist, Gloria Anzaldua, who on page 88 of her Borderlands clearly supports Rodriguez, a support Rodriguez strangely fails to marshal with a specific citation? This book, with its strong empirical base, could be even more exciting in its conclusion if it engaged with contemporary debates and did not merely respond to a now increasingly dated social science literature. Such an engagement could also be a platform for a theoretical inquiry into the relationship between ordinary cultural citizens and the elites who presume to represent them. The absence of such an engagement might have been avoided. This is a presumably revised version of the author's 1991 doctoral dissertation. While there is no set time interval for such reproductions, I found myself wish- ing that a bit more time had been taken in revision. The larger question posed above might have been engaged, and some minor problems might have been addressed. The prose could be more fluid and the multiple references per page could be handled with greater economy and subtlety. Her review of Mexican-American history is also burdened by now-dated sources. Why she chose "accul- turated" versus other kinds of women is not clearly ex- plained. Yet, setting aside my wishes for what this book might be and its relatively minor problems, Rodriguez has made a valuable contribution, and those of us who work at the intersection of cultural studies, greater Mexico, women's studies, and folklore are in her debt. 1 Women in Pain: Gender and Morbidity in Mexico. Kaya Finkler. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994. xviii + 238 pp. C. H. BROWNER University of California, Los Angeles Kaya Finkler's new book takes on the puzzling ques- tion why women in industrialized and developing socie- ties are more susceptible than men to sickness and more likely to seek medical treatment when ill. Previous expla- nations have ranged from microlevel theories of gender- based biological or psychogenic differences to macrolevel analyses of the division of labor by sex. Building on Physicians at Work, Patients in Pain, her recent book about medical practice in urban Mexico (Westview, 1991), and on over 20 years of Mexican ethno- graphic research, Finkler proposes a novel explanation. She argues that many of the nonspecific, chronic health problems suffered by impoverished people are caused by "life's lesions": the existential challenges, moral indigna- tions, and problematic social relationships that shape human existence. Over time, life's lesions become "in- scribed" within the body and made manifest through an- guish, pain, and a diverse symptomatology whose etiolo- gies defy modem medicine. Drawing upon a popular Mexican ethnomedical model, Finkler suggests that emo- tions, particularly "making angers," are the mechanism through which life's lesions become inscribed. She be- lieves that women are more vulnerable than men to their crippling effects because sexist practices and ideologies render women powerless to change the situations that offend them. Their moral indignation is experienced as anger, but expressed as sickness. Finkler goes beyond the conventional stress para- dign with its individualistic focus to propose an illness model that incorporates social relations, ideological pre- cepts, and poverty. In this sense, the life's lesions concept differs from the biomedical notions of somatization and psychosomatic illness, which tend to blame the sufferer and ignore the impact of objective circumstances on an individual's health. The monograph consists of three parts. Part 1 offers outstanding reviews of the literature on the nature of sickness, gender, and gender differences in health and</page><page sequence="2">388 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST . VOL. 97, NO. 2 . JUNE 1995 of the tlahuelpuchi. Based primarily on detailed, firsthand descriptions (collected by Nutini) of 47 cases of infant or child death (one case was that of a seven-year-old boy), the authors use what they term an "epistemological method" to analyze the belief system in rural Tlaxcala that permitted the culpability for certain infant deaths to be attributed to the bloodsucking witch. They then attempt to determine the "actual" causes of the deaths (in several cases Nutini was aided by local physicians). In doing so they are effecting a comparison of the local epistemology with the Western naturalistic epistemology, the blood- sucking witch having ontological reality in the former but not, of course, in the latter. The book is somewhat unusual in its layout. Chapters 1 through 4 give great detail about the belief system in rural Tlaxcala that supports four anthropomorphic super- naturals, the tezittlazc (a weatherman or conjurer), the nahual (an individual who transforms into an animal and is basically a sort of trickster), the tetlachihuic (sorcerer), and the tlahuelpuchi, as well as their historical develop- ment and distribution in Mesoamerica. Chapters 5 and 6 present a finely detailed account of an epidemic of blood- sucking witchcraft that occurred in a rural Tlaxcalan village on December 9, 1960, plus information about the 40 other cases in the sample. Chapter 6 includes a number of tables that summarize important particulars about the 47 cases and lead into the explanation of bloodsucking witchcraft as an explanatory system that competed with naturalistic modes of explanation. Chapter 7 presents a theoretical background, while chapter 8 is fundamentally an exposition of what really happened to the 47 victims of the tlahuelpuchi. Nutini and Roberts indicate that the infant deaths actually were due to (1) asphyxia that re- sulted when their mothers breast-fed them at night and fell asleep, (2) suffocation under blankets or other items as they slept, (3) choking as a result of not being burped after breast-feeding at night, (4) infanticide, or (5) crib death. Chapter 9 describes the mutually reinforcing as- pects of ideology and the bloodsucking events. To summarize (and simplify, for there is an enormous amount of data as well as intricate and detailed analyses in this volume), the authors (1) present an ethnography, including 47 case studies, of bloodsucking witchcraft in rural Tlaxcala; (2) interpret the actions of the tlahuelpuchi and the social and psychological consequences of the suckings in terms of both Tlaxcalan and Western episte- mologies; (3) summarize and critically discuss the anthro- pological literature on witchcraft, sorcery, and the distinc- tion between the natural and the supernatural; (4) chronicle changes in the belief system of rural Tlaxcala related to bloodsucking witchcraft from around the turn of the century up to the present (and in particular between 1960 and 1986); and (5) develop a theory of change in folk systems of witchcraft and magic supernaturalism under the influence of diffusion and acceptance and utilization illness. Part 2 traces the history of Mexican gender rela- tions from the time of the conquest to the present. It also provides an aggregate view of the larger clinic population from which the ten case studies that follow were drawn and compares those sick women with a population of healthy ones who live in the same neighborhoods. Part 3, the heart of the book, presents detailed por- traits that reveal how life's lesions shape the conscious- ness and experience of ten disparate women. The por- traits reveal the resilience often seen in individuals who must build lives with few economic resources, difficult marriages, and sparse social support. Interestingly, al- though most have been ill for many years, several see improvement during the course of Finkler's research. The author attributes this to the fact that those who improve have taken some control over their lives by, for example, opening a business, taking up karate, or emotionally ex- tricating themselves from destructive family ties. It is in the life's lesions concept that the book's strengths and weaknesses are revealed. Finkler's para- digrn is richly holistic, shunning the reductionism that has historically characterized biomedical research. Yet its breadth restricts its analytical value. Although the lives of the ten women we meet appear typical of their culture and class, we never learn why they have developed debilitat- ing "lesions" while most of their neighbors have not. In this context Finkler could have more fully developed her interesting ideas about anger as the hypothesized bridge between experience and sickness. But while the role of anger in these women's lives is occasionally mentioned, it is not systematically explored. The value of the book lies in its poignant stories and the insight they offer into their tellers' views as to what brought their suffering about. Still needed, however, are more systematic data on how life's lesions cause illness and suffering, particularly for women. Finkler is to be congratulated for identifying a most promising research direction. A Bloodsucking Witchcraft: An Epistemological Study of Anthropomorphic Supernaturalism in Rural Tlaxcala. Hugo G. Nutini and John M. Roberts. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1993. 476 pp. GARRY E. CHICK University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign As recently as a generation ago, belief in anthropo- morphic supernaturals, including the tlahuelpuchi, a per- son who was born with the capability to change into animal form and an uncontrollable thirst for the blood of infants, was widespread in rural Tlaxcala, Mexico. Though the matrix of beliefs that include the bloodsuck- ing witch has dramatically weakened since the 1960s, occasional infant deaths are still attributed to the actions</page></plain_text>
