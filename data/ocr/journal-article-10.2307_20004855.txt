WILES Regius Professor of Divinity, the University of Oxford RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY AND DIVINE ACTION1 'Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: and then stop.' The King of Hearts' advice is not as easy to follow as might seem on first hearing. It is not simply that I want to speak about the interrelation between two major subjects and there is a certain arbitrariness in choosing with which of the two to start. The problem is far more fundamental than that. Where for the theologian is 'the beginning'? At whatever point he does begin he is always uneasily aware that way back behind the point that he has chosen there probably lie a number of unquestioned assumptions which have largely prejudged the kind of answer he will give to the very question he is setting out to investigate. This difficulty is not, of course, peculiar to the theologian. None of us, whatever the subject of our investigation, can ever really 'begin at the beginning'. But if this is a difficulty which the Christian theologian shares with other scholars it is none the less real for that. One obvious and important feature of the tradition in which the Christian theologian stands is that it gives some kind of special authority to the Bible, to the Church and above all-though it is sometimes a little bit elusive to know exactly what is meant by saying this-to Christ himself. Now if we agree that the acceptance of some authority of this kind, even in the most general sense, is a part of the tradition within which a Christian theologian works, we shall have to acknowledge that when we take up the question of divine action, of what we can properly mean by speaking of God acting, we appear to be deeply committed already on the subject of our investigation-and that in a twofold manner. In the first place, we are committed in what I would call a formal way by the bare fact that we do accept certain books or certain people as having special authority for us; there is, that is to say, an element of prejudgment in relation to our theme implicit in the mere fact of such an acceptance in itself quite apart from what the particular books or people in question may actually say. For whatever may be our precise conception of the inspira tion of the prophets or Biblical writers, whatever may be our precise under standing of the guidance by which Church Councils or the Magisterium reach their decisions, it has normally been understood to involve some kind of special divine action, action of a distinctive kind, in relation to those people or those occasions. 1 Originally given as a public lecture in the University of Manchester. A</page><page sequence="2">2 M. F. WILES But we are also committed in a second way, in what I would call a sub stantial way, by the content of what those authorities do in fact say to us. This is very much more than a matter of the Bible being a book which includes a number of miracle stories. The idea of divine providential action seen in a series of specific historical events runs right through the Bible, so that a well-known book of Biblical theology can very properly be entitled 'God who acts'. Thus form and content serve to reinforce one another. Unless God acts in a special way in special events it is difficult to see how we could have religious authorities from within history with the degree of specialness which Christians do in fact ascribe to their authorities. And those very authorities in fact do speak of a God who acts in precisely that kind of a way. A Christian, therefore, it is widely felt, must accept a conception of God's acting in the world of this kind-or else, everything collapses; nothing would remain that could merit the title of being specifically Christian. Now it seems to me that there are obvious difficulties in affirming this view of special divine actions in the world. A good many people, I would suggest, do feel misgivings about it but continue to affirm it nevertheless because they do not believe that it is possible to affirm a recognisably Christian faith on any other terms. The situation is similar to that by which many people have maintained-and indeed still do maintain - a near funda mentalist understanding of scripture, despite being well aware of the grave difficulties inherent in that position, because they do not believe it is possible to affirm the Bible to be divine revelation in any serious sense on any other terms. It seems important therefore to ask whether this conception of divine action is as necessary to a recognisably Christian faith as on the face of it it appears to be. The kind of misgiving to which I refer is I think clear enough but it can perhaps be made clearer by a comparison with the realm of science and the concept of God's action in the natural world. In the Newtonian system, as is well known, nature functioned for the most part as a self-regulating system, but certain special actions on the part of God were required to correct, for example, the irregularities caused by the mutual attraction of the planets. As further advances in knowledge made possible normal scientific explanations of these phenomena, so this 'God of the gaps' was edged further and further out of the world. This process has not meant, however, that it has become impossible to speak in any way at all of God in relation to the natural world. Rather, I would want to say, it has made possible the reaffirmation of a more profound concept of God as the transcendent ground of there being a world at all. Is there then any parallel in the historical field? Do traditional accounts of the Christian faith really involve a God of the historical gaps? And if so, would modification of that conception lead to the impossibility of affirming a recognisably Christian faith at all or might it lead to the</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY AND DIVINE ACTION 3 possibility of reaffirming it in a more profound and more satisfactory form? No one has been more acutely aware of this problem in our own time than Rudolf Bultmann. It is an essential part of that fundamental concern which gave rise to his programme of demythologisation. Yet Bultmann insists most emphatically that the concept of God's decisive act in Jesus Christ must be maintained, for it is in his judgment the very heart of the Christian gospel. For this he has been vigorously attacked by many of his critics who have claimed, in the words of one of them, that 'these two words (act of God) set up a whole mythical universe'.' The criticism has been levelled from both sides. Some have seen in his insistence on the necessity to retain the idea of an 'act of God' a welcome victory of his Christian heart over his demythologising head; they have regarded it as an arbitrary lirmit to his demythologising programme imposed upon him by his Christian convictions but thereby calling in question the necessity and the validity of the earlier stages of his demythologising. Others, from the more radical side, have seen in it a regrettable failure of nerve, an unjustifiable refusal to press through with his programme of demythologising to its logical and desirable conclusion. Bultmann has defended himself by claiming that the concept of an act of God as he understands it is not mythological at all but analogical. Whether or not that is a satisfactory terminological distinction is not a matter of great im portance for us here; but the substantive content of the distinction he is trying to establish is of central importance to my present concern. This is how Bultmann himself makes the point in answering his critics: 'Mythological thinking represents the divine action ... as an action that breaks into and disrupts the continuum of natural, historical, or psychical events-in short, as a "miracle". In so doing it objectifies the divine action and projects it on to the plane of worldly occurrences. In truth, however, . . . an act of God is not visible to the objectifying eye and cannot be demonstrated in the manner of worldly events. The idea of unworldliness and transcendence of the divine action is only preserved when such action is represented not as something that takes place between worldly occurrences, but rather as something that takes place in them, so that the closed continuum of worldly events that presents itself to the objectifying eye remains untouched. God's act is hidden to every eye but that of faith. The only thing generally visible and demonstrable is the "natural" occurrence. It is in it that God's hidden action takes place. In faith the closed weft (of cause and effect) presented or produced by objective observation is transcended, though not as in mythological thought. For mythology imagines it to be torn asunder, whereas faith transcends it as a whole when it speaks of the activity of God.'2 Now there are certainly many serious difficulties in what Bultmann is 1 Otto Kuster cited by H. Zahrnt, The Question of God, p. 246. 2 Cf. ed. H. W. Bartsch, Kerygma and Myth, Vol. i, pp. 197, 198-9.</page><page sequence="4">4 M. F. WILES trying to say here, but I do not think it is difficult to see the nature of the fundamental distinction he wants to make by which an 'act of God' is not a mythological concept in his sense. It is closely parallel to the familiar avoidance of a 'God of the gaps' approach to the natural world. Divine acts do not take place 'between worldy occurrences'-i.e. in the gaps left by natural events, but in them in a hidden manner which does not affect in any way the closed weft of cause and effect. Moreover this does not involve, for Bultmann, a weakening of the religious significance of the conception of God's activity in history; rather it makes possible its fully transcendent character. If something of this kind is a fair account of what Bultmann intends when he speaks of an 'act of God', a number of important questions have to be faced. Is it a possible conception? or is it a muddled attempt to hold on to the old religious language while abandoning the religious reality which that language was designed to express? If it is a possible conception, are there grounds for affirming it to be true or at least worthy of belief? And, even if there are, can we claim that it does justice to the main traditional affir mations of the Christian faith? It is easy to put the challenge that Bultmann's notion of an act of God is vacuous in a down to earth no-nonsense manner. In an article entitled 'Does the "God who acts" really act?'" an American writer, F. B. Dilley, argues that the Biblical theologian must choose between acknowledging the reality of the miraculous or else admitting that the concept of a 'God who acts' has no proper content. The challenge is a healthy one but at least as Dilley puts it it seems to be posed in too stark a form. In the course of the article he quotes a part of the passage from Bultmann which I have already cited and comments: 'Unfortunately it does not take much reflection to perceive that although this theory may be very attractive, it is impossible to make it really work.'2 That Bultmann's conception is a difficult one, that ultimately we may have to admit that it does not really work, I do not want to deny. But I think it does require rather more reflection than Dilley claims. He does not seem to me to pay sufficient attention in his criticisms to the logical oddity of religious language. Has the concept of a 'God who creates man in his own image' no proper content if a wholly evolutionary account of man's origin is accepted? Most of us would say that the evolutionary account is in no way incompatible with the concept of a creator God, whose creating is not identical with but analogous to human creating. It does not seem to me to be any more impossible in principle to speak of an active God whose action is to be seen 'in' rather than 'between' wordly occurrences. Of course the possibility of saying something does not prove its truth. In both cases, creation and divine action in history, it is not enough to argue that the con 1 Anglican Theological Review, Vol. 47 (January I965), pp. 66-8o. Cf. also L. B.

In the case of creation it is man's experiencing of the world as contingent, as in some fundamental sense given, as not self-explanatory, which has given rise-in my judgment rightly given rise-to the affirmation of God as creator. What then are the grounds which have led men to speak of a God who acts in history? I want to suggest that the conviction is very largely rooted in the fact that so much of the most profound personal experience has about it a quality of response; men have found a meaning and a sense of purpose, bigger than their own comparatively narrow concerns, being elicited as it were by the events of history-sometimes events of an obviously impressive kind, sometimes events of an outwardly insignificant character. What I am trying to describe is not a matter of conscious inference, not a worked out way of explaining experiences to oneself; rather, to use a phrase that John Hick has made familiar in relation to the natural world, it is a matter of 'experiencing-as', of experiencing what happens to us and what we achieve as being in response to an overall purpose at work in the world. It is in the attempt to articulate this way of experiencing life that men have spoken of God as acting in history-a phrase vividly expressing the experience of receptivity which it is intended to express but which can also be dangerously misleading if taken too literally. There is no question of course of this being a kind of deductive proof any more than the cosmological argument can properly be regarded as such; it needs to be seen as one part of that total response to the world in which theism is grounded. All I want to claim here is that there is a fundamental aspect of human experiencing which can suggest a possible line ofjustification for the kind of talk about divine action which I am trying to explore. But I have still to face my third question. Even if such a view of divine action is both possible and reasonable, does it do justice to the main tradi tional affirmations of the Christian faith? This question can be spelt out in a number of different ways. I intend to break it up into two separate questions: (i) can it account for the particularity of the divine action of which Christian ity speaks? (ii) is its description of divine-human relationships true to the personal character of God in his dealings with men, as Christian faith under stands them, or, to put essentially the same point in a slightly different form, is its account of divine action one in which the word 'action' is being given a proper sense and is something more than a piece of linguistic legerdemain? (i) First then, the problem of particularity which is so prominent in any Christian account of God's activity in history. I begin once again with a parallel with the doctrine of creation. The natural world, like human history, is an ambiguous mixture of natural evils and natural beauty. Even if we rightly reject any form of Gnostic dualism which seeks to free God from all responsibility for the former, we seem bound to speak of some aspects of the</page><page sequence="6">6 M. F. WILES natural world as giving rise more directly to the apprehension of God's creative role than others. I do not think that we can properly speak of God being more creative in one place than in another; the transcendent creator creature relationship does not permit of being graded in terms of less and more. Nevertheless I think we may speak of certain aspects of the created order as particularly potent vehicles for human awareness of divine creativity. With this analogy in mind let us turn to the far more acute problem of particularity in historical experience. Not all events elicit equally the sense of response to purposive activity of which I have been speaking. For the Christian the life of Christ, and certain other events also within what is commonly referred to as 'salvation history', have an outstanding potency of this kind and are seen as special divine actions. No one stresses the particular ity of the divine action in Jesus Christ more than Bultmann. Since I have used him as my exemplar of a conception of divine action which is sure to appear to some to be seriously 'reductionist' in character, I must in fairness emphasise that he cannot possibly be accused of being 'reductionist' in any sense with regard to the specialness of tbe divine action in Christ. For him authentic existence (or, in my language, a sense of life as purposive in response to the prior purposive activity of God towards man) can only be realised on the basis of the particular historical event of Jesus Christ. I can only align myself with those who have criticised Bultmann for the absolute and exclusive nature of the claim that he makes here. As Schubert Ogden puts it: 'The New Testament claim "only in Jesus Christ" must be interpreted to mean not that God acts to redeem only in the event of Jesus and in no other event, but that the only God who acts to redeem any event-although in fact he redeems every event-is the God whose redemptive action is decisively revealed in the word which Jesus speaks and is.'1 But this, of course, does not remove, it only restates, our problem. How can God's action be 'decisively revealed' in certain events and not in others ? Can we give any proper meaning to this less exclusive form of affirmation about the special nature of God's action in Christ without falling back into all the difficulties of an action of God which is different in kind from his activity elsewhere, an action which is to be seen 'between' rather than 'in' the worldly occurrences concerned? If we cannot, then whatever the possibility and the reasonableness of conceiving divine action in the way that I am suggesting, we would have to admit that it failed to do justice to the basic affirmations of a distinctively Christian faith. I want to argule-though tentatively and in a way that certainly admits that there may be counter arguments which will cause me to change my mind-that it is possible, that my proposed conception of divine action is not incompatible with speaking 1 ed. C. W. Kegley, The Theology of Rudolf Bultmann, p. i22.</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY AND DIVINE ACTION 7 of God's redemptive action as 'decisively revealed in the word which Jesus speaks and is'. I have claimed that it is in the experiencing of life as having the quality of response that the reality of divine action is known. This is in line with Bultmann's oft-repeated warnings against a false objectification of God. It does not mean that the whole concept of God or of divine action is purely subjective in the pejorative sense of that elusive term, which would imply that they were simply ways of describing certain human feelings. It does mean however that the idea of divine action cannot be extracted from its context of being experienced and then considered in isolation from all forms of human response. In some words of Daniel Williams: 'Every "act of God" is presented to us in, through and with the complex of nature and life in which we are. When we say God elected Israel or that he sends his rain on the just and the unjust, we must not ignore the complex analysis of assignable causes and factors in Israel's history or in the cosmic record of rainfall. We have no way of extricating the acts of God from their involvement in the activities of the world.'" Now it is an inevitable feature of the variety to be found within human history that some people by virtue of their personality and of their situation are more fully responsive to the divine action than others. Their words and actions in turn will provide a particularly important focus for calling out such responses from others who follow them. And since that quality of life in them to which those others will respond was itself grounded in responsive ness to the divine action, we may rightly speak of the events of their lives as acts of God in a special sense towards those of us who are influenced by them. In calling them special acts of God we would not be implying that there was any fundamental difference in the relation of the divine action to the particular worldly occurrences of their situation; we would be referring to the depth of response and the creative potential for eliciting further response from others embodied in those particular lives or those particular events. It would be a natural, but I believe ultimately mistaken, fear to imagine that by describing divine action in this way we are giving a purely human istic account in which the reality of the divine is ultimately obliterated. Rather what we are doing is avoiding the error of thinking that we can ever describe divine action in any other context than that of its experienced response. This approach finds clear and direct expression in some words from Peter Baelz's book, Prayer and Providence, where he discusses the problem of how we can speak of more and less in the activity of God. He writes: 'God's providential activity is to be discerned in the way in which he meets and overcomes that which stands out against and resists his creative will. Here we see more of him than in any other situation. His activity meets with the creaturely 1 D. D. Williams 'How does God act?: an essay in Whitehead's metaphyics' in edd. W. L. Reese and E. Freeman, Process and Divinity, pp. 1 79-80.</page><page sequence="8">8 M. F. WILES response which it seeks and towards which it is directed. It is fulfilled in the response which it evokes. It penetrates and enables the relatively independent activity of the creature. It supernaturalises the natural. In such providential and redemptive activity we come to discern a deeper aspect of God's being. There is a "more" of God to be apprehended here than elsewhere. His word speaks more clearly, his work is more complete. Christians claim to discern such distinctive activity of God in the life and work of Jesus. Thus on the cross, as he makes his final, life-giving act of self-surrender to his Father, Jesus exclaims, "It is finished", and Christians ascribe in response to this a completion and finality to the divine work. Creator and creature are here at one. The divine love has conquered. God remains eternally the same God; but in and through the obedient response of Jesus his activity is more fully discerned, because more fully expressed. And since it is more fully expressed, there is a very proper sense in which we may speak of God's special activity." Clearly there is both room and need for continuing discussion how far this approach which I have tried to exemplify from that rather lengthy quotation from Peter Baelz can provide an adequate understanding of the saving events of Christian history. For the moment I want simply to claim that it is not in principle incapable of doing justice to the idea of certain events being divine acts of a specially decisive kind-and, as I am suggesting all along, if it is capable of doing so at all it may be expected to do the job in a way which will be free of many of the difficulties that are attendant on more traditional statements of the unique character of certain events in Christian history. (ii) I must turn to the second charge which might be brought against the approach I am advocating, the charge that it cannot do justice to a properly Christian conception of God's action because it does not conceive that activity in a sufficiently personal way. The charge might reasonably be developed along some such lines as these. You, it might be said, have drawn analogies at various points between the view of God's relation to the natural world and that of his relation to history. But, it might be claimed, Christians have been able to accept an account of God's creative relationship to the world which is of a general rather than a varying kind without imperilling the sense of a fully personal religion just because that more variable and personal approach of God to man is to be found in his activity within history. To argue therefore from an analogy with God's creative relationship will not do-. That relationship by itself is not adequately personal to sustain the needs and convictions of the religious life. If God's relationship to men were all of the more generalised kind which is implied in our understanding of him as creator, the religious realities to which Christian faith testifies would evapor ate. The kind of understanding of God as creator to which we are being led in this modern age is tolerable precisely because it is not the measure of all his relationships towards us. 1 P. Baelz, Prayer and Providence, pp. 8I-2.</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY AND DIVINE ACTION 9 My primary answer to objections of this kind would be that they seem to me to operate with too simplified a conception of God as personal being. The traditional distinction between an I-thou and an I-it relationship has many values in theology but if applied in too straightforward a manner to divine-human relationships it can lead to an excessively anthropomorphic picture. God's relationship to man must never be understood in sub-personal terms but the test of where this is happening is more reliably to be found in what the relationship as conceived implies for human life than in what picture of God appears to be involved. We cannot, I have argued, speak significantly of God or of his acting in an objectified way, wholly separated from the human response, and it is therefore the total relationship which must be assessed in determining whether our understanding is true to a properly personal conception of God. Now the position which I am tenta tively advocating is one in which divine action is throughout most closely correlated with human responsiveness. Thus the total relationship, it would seem to me, is being understood in a personal way in every sense in which that can properly be applied to a theological discussion of divine-human relationships. But the objection may also be met along somewhat different lines. I suggested as an alternative formulation of the objection that it might be questioned whether the kind of divine action envisaged could properly be regarded as action in any real sense. This way of putting the problem draws attention to a difficulty which is attendant upon any attempt to bring together the convictions of Biblical religion and a wholehearted insistence on divine transcendence. It is a recurrent theme at the heart of the issues with which the Fathers wrestled in the course of that confluence of Greek philo sophy and Biblical faith which marks the first centuries of the Christian era. The classical solutions to that problem, as seen for example in the writings of Aquinas, have always had to qualify the notion of divine action in a somewhat embarrassed and equivocating manner. Since God is complete in himself, eternal and changeless being, any talk of his acting in the world at all-let alone in the specific and particular ways of which the Christian tradition speaks-must be very carefully qualified. In Aquinas' own lan guage, 'being related to God is a reality in creatures but being related to creatures is not reality in God'.' Now of course behind all such language lies an extremely subtle and complex philosophical position. Nevertheless I think the point still stands that within the main Christian tradition the 'reality' of God's acting has had to be severely qualified. Schubert Ogden, whose work I have already quoted, speaks of 'the timeless absolute of class ical metaphysics, who may be said to act only in some Pickwickian sense that bears no real analogy to anything we know as action'.2 He goes on in the same essay, which is entitled 'What sense does it make to say "God acts in 1 Aquinas, Summa Theologica x a, I3, 7. 2 The Reality of God, p. I8o.</page><page sequence="10">IO M. F. WILES history"', to make use of the insights of process philosophy, as outlined by Whitehead and Hartshorne, to develop a conception of divine action similar to that which I am advocating here. Dilley ends his article of challenge to the Biblical theologian by looking in the same direction. Its last words are: 'Perhaps someone with one eye on Whitehead and the other on the Bible will bring in the next era in theology.' Ogden's claim is that by working along these lines he is enabled to put forward a view in which the divine actions can be seen as acts of God in a much more real, though of course still analogical, sense than when seen in terms of the classical metaphysical tradition. His account has certainly its own difficulties which I cannot investigate now. But I think he has at least made out a strong case on the basis of which it is not unreasonable to claim that the account of divine action which I have been adumbrating not only gives a sufficiently 'real' sense to the notion of God acting but one that may even have positive advantages on that score over more traditional accounts. I must come back now and try to relate the conception of divine action which I have been sketching to the notion of religious authority, and in particular to the authority of the Bible. Unless we give some kind of special place to the Bible, I do not see how there could be a distinctively Christian theology at all. If therefore the existence of the Bible as an authority or its essential contents should prove to be incompatible with the account that I have given, the argument which I have been trying to develop would fall apart. The question must therefore be put: does the Bible as a religious authority conflict with what I have been saying in either the formal or the substantial way which I distinguished at the beginning? The former need not, I think, detain us very long. In effect I have already answered it in my attempt to show that my view is compatible with speaking of God's redemptive activity as 'decisively revealed in the word which Jesus speaks and is'. If certain events can be given such special importance without implying a different kind of activity on God's part in relation to the worldly occurrences concerned, then clearly the records which partly record and partly constitute such events can properly be regarded as having religious authority without that fact implying any special interventionist activity as responsible either for their composition or for their recognition as authori tative. Such an approach also opens the way to ascribing some measure of religious authority to the scriptures of other faiths without necessarily destroying the idea of something distinctive or decisive about the Christian scriptures in doing so. In the present situation in which Christian theology has to learn to do its task in a way which takes seriously other expressions of religion in the world, this seems to me to be a positive advantage. Just as the Christian understanding of God contains within itself the seeds of criticism which have led to the modification or abandonment of, for example, certain ideas of hell,</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY AND DIVINE ACTION II despite the formal attestation of those ideas within the Christian tradition itself, so I believe the same understanding of God is ultimately incompatible with certain exclusivist conceptions of religious authority despite their sub stantial presence within the historical tradition of the faith. Modifications of the idea of religious authority along these lines are not simply something that is imposed from without; they arise also from within. But the second issue-the issue of the compatibility of the Biblical contents -is more difficult. In so far as those contents are defined as giving special attention to particular events no new difficulty arises, which I have not already discussed. But the Bible does more than that. It does not merely witness to events, it interprets them; it understands them in a particular way and that way is undoubtedly very different from the way in which I am proposing that they should be understood. There are exceptions but I would judge that almost overwhelmingly the Bible's way of understanding those special events to which it bears witness is one in which the activity of God in relation to the worldly occurrences concerned is conceived to be of a different kind from that which is operative in the general run of wordly occurrences. Is it consistent then to regard the Bible as a religious authority, which as I have said seems to be an inescapable necessity for a Christian theology, and at the same time to transform as drastically as my account would involve its own understanding of those events to which it bears witness? This issue came to the fore in an extreme form in the recent 'Death of God' controversy. William Hamilton asks the question: 'ifJesus' demonology, cosmology and eschatology (are) taken as first century views, appropriate then, not so now, needing reinterpretation and understanding, but not literal assent, what is inherently different about Jesus' theology?'" In other words, once we cease to take over and accept for ourselves the Biblical understanding of the world in its totality (if indeed there is or ever was such a thing) by what criterion do we decide what it is proper to accept and what to reject? The question is a fair one, and can be met in two ways. In the first place we may ask whether Jesus' belief in God is not more central to what he stands for than his belief in eschatology and demons, so that if that goes Jesus' person and teaching simply cease to be really interesting. I think a distinction of that kind can be drawn, though it would be grossly misleading to suggest that either the eschatology or demonology were so peripheral that no serious issue at all arose in their case. But secondly and more significantly we need to ask whether there may not be other supporting grounds, in the field of natural theology for example, for continuing to affirm the theology of Jesus in a way which it might not be reasonable to do in the cases of eschatology and demonology. In trying to apply these two tests to our present case, I would claim that it is the specialness of the events rather than the special way in which the divine 1 Edd. J. L. Ice and J. J. Carey, The Death of God Debate, p. 223.</page><page sequence="12">I2 M. F. WILES action was understood to be operative in them that is most fundamental. I admit that this is not an easy distinction to make but I think that it can be made. And secondly I would claim on the basis of my earlier discussion to have shown (admittedly in very bare outline) that there may be good reason in our total understanding of the world to-day for continuing to affirm the former and not continuing to affirm the latter. Thus, while I have no desire to disguise or to minimise in any way the extent of the difference between the way that I am proposing for understanding the special divine activity of which the Bible speaks and the Bible's own understanding of it, I do want to argue that this very considerable difference does not prevent me from continuing to regard the Bible as a religious authority of the utmost importance. 'Begin at the beginning, and go on until you come to the end: and then stop.' But the end-point is as hard to identify as the beginning. In stopping at this point, I do not wish to suggest for a moment that I believe myself to have solved the problems which I have been discussing. My hope is rather that I have said enough to provide a sufficiently coherent account of a possible approach to these puzzling questions for others to develop or, more probably, to expose the flaws and shortcomings in what has been said.</page></plain_text>
