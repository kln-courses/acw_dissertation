XXXI, No. 7 MARCH 29, 1934 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE OBJECTIVITY OF MIND I N the recent discussion of the relations of realism and idealism, several important points of agreement between contemporary schools have been recognized.' Significant among these, we may note especially: (1) Speculative realism (e.g., that of Professor Alex- ander) and dualistic realism (e.g., that of Professor Pratt) agree with idealism in holding that the world should be regarded as a totality of organically unified inter-related parts. (2) Both realism and objective (or speculative) idealism agree that physical objects may exist independently of any individual conscious minds. (3) Both dualistic realism and objective idealism, together with prag- matism, agree that absolute knowledge of the physical world is not empirically attainable. Philosophical accounts of external nature, relying on empirical data, in a strict sense are hypothetical and rest back upon some such basis as utility, instinctive or "animal" faith, or speculative reason. It is an ancient custom of philosophers, how- ever, to discuss their points of difference rather than agreement, and it is not my purpose here to violate the tradition, but to consider certain aspects of what appears to be the central issue between con- temporary naturalism, realism, and idealism, namely, the objectivity of mind. The question of the status and relationship of the "space-time actuality and the ideal element in things" has been called by Pro- fessor Muirhead, the main problem of philosophy. Only that ghostly 1 Cf. Contemporary Idealism in America by twelve idealists; also J. B. Pratt, "Is Idealism RealismI" in this JOURNAL, Vol. XXX, pp. 169 if.; C. L. Barrett, "Is Idealism Realism?

In addition to these papers, the issues were discussed in a symposium before the annual meeting of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Asso- ciation, which had as its subject: "The Status of Mind in Nature." Papers were presented by Professors Hendel, Murphy, and Pratt, and were discussed by Professors Blanshard, Brightman, and Barrett. Quotations from this symposium are from abstracts of their papers, as prepared by the speakers. Among recent publications on the subject, of especial importance is Professor G. W. Cunningham's The Idealistio Argutment in Recent British and American Philosophy.

For others, the fundamental problem of knowledge and of action, as well as of metaphysics, is that of how the order of objects and events in external nature is related to the order of meanings and values in minds. Professor Pratt has insisted that no important difference seems to him to differentiate objective idealism from naturalism, but on this basic issue there is the widest opposition. For naturalism, meanings and values, as emergents or psychological creations, are something added on to the world of physical existence. They are either derived from the meaningless and valueless processes of nature, and are of secondary status, or if any priority of importance is conceded to them, it is because from them, human beings secure satisfaction. For objective idealism, on the other hand, meanings and values can not be adequately explained in psychogenetic terms, or as de- rivatives from anything in the structure of the real world which is genuinely alien to them in its nature. Quite aside from the meta- physical problem of how human experience, with its organization in terms of meanings and values, could be produced by a world- order whose regulative principles had nothing in common with such an organization, there is also, and nearer at hand, the problem of knowledge. Since any inquiry whatsoever into the existential or factual nature of things must be carried on by means of hypotheses and verification formulated in terms of the mind's order of mean- ings and values, it would seem folly to talk of understanding nature in any other terms. Judgments of factuality are themselves value judgments, and the predication of existence involves valuation. This does not mean that a natural order alien to the order of mind might not be in some sense, and certainly it does not imply that the external world is dependent for its being on being perceived by a conscious mind, but it does mean that only in so far as the order of external nature is in unison with the mind's order, can human beings understand or act purposefully in it. The individual subjective mind is to be distinguished, not from, but within, its world. From one point of view, for the particular mind, the objective world may appear to be something opposed or even alien, something "other'" than itself. But the dualist errs in taking this to be the only point of view. In another and more profound sense, the particular human mind must regard itself as a part of and genuinely one with that world, for it is not on the side of their separateness and difference, but in their unity, that the possibility of knowledge, even that degree of practical knowledge requisite for prediction and control, rests. As Professor Alexander points out, "Strictly speaking, it is this</page><page sequence="3">THfE OBJECTIVITY OF MIND 171 totality of knower and known, of subject and object, which is true or good or beautiful" (Space, Time, and Deity, II, 238). One would expect a view thus emphasizing the unity of the order of human mind and of external nature to be received very cordially by the realist, for it provides one, if not, indeed, the only, thoroughly con- sistent basis for realism. Naturalism has recognized a degree of unity in the order of mind and of physical nature. It has sought to deal with mental life in terms of those characteristics which it has in common with levels of existence below it. But mental life reveals, and is differentiated by, other characteristics which are not evident in physical nature. These have persistently haunted the naturalist as a kind of re- mainder or addenda left over after his account is finished. Since they include most of what seems to human beings to be or possess any significance, the inability to deal with them successfully is a serious disadvantage to a philosophical system. The objective ideal- ist, on the other hand, assigns priority to mind. Finding mind to be the fullest and highest expression available to us of the order of the world, he insists on what seems a reasonable course in metaphysi- cal investigation, namely, that of seeking to understand the less by the greater. He recognizes quite frankly that unless we take the order of mind to be a genuine expression of the order of the real world, our judgments of fact are as idle as our judgments of value; whereas if we do admit such unity, meanings and values present a real and fundamental aspect of the nature of things. Other inter- pretations than those which we label "factual" may also present that which is true and real. The interpretations of poetry and art, of morality and religion, of social tradition and all the varied in- terests of utility, embodying as they do, many of the most profound developments of human thought, need not be dismissed as too human to express something ultimate and real in the nature of the world. The same external order provides objects at once of scientific, esthetic, religious, moral, and utilitarian interpretation. To say that the order of meanings and values, on the basis of which all of these, and every other interpretation of human thought, must pro- ceed, reveals the nature of the human mind, but not that of the real world, is to call Nature something genuinely closed to mind. Hav- ing gone thus far, there is no logical escape from denying intelli- gibility to the world and even pragmatic value to thought and action. The objective idealist prefers to regard the order of mind as con- ditioned by and expressive of the world-order which produces it. He prefers to regard it as no less a revelation of the nature of the universe than that existential world which he knows, and can know, only as one of the constructions of this interpreting mind. The only</page><page sequence="4">172 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY satisfactory escape from the egocentric predicament is through faith -faith in the validity of the external reference of the mind's in- terpreting activities. If our knowledge is only of its ideas and not through its ideas, utter scepticism is inevitable. But though the external world is saved for us only by faith, it is a faith backed by necessity. Deprived of their objects, all activities of thinking, of willing, of feeling, all inclinations to take interest in or oppose any- thing, all recognition of self and of responsibility, would lose their significance, and indeed, would be impossible. Thus the sole ration- ally justifiable basis for an acceptance of the existential world, is located in the imperative character of value, as, also, every judg- ment and interpretation of the existential character of the world is formulated in termis of the mind's order of meanings and values, and depends for its validity on a oneness of this order with that of the real world. When Professor Pratt finds difficulty in differentiating objective idealism from naturalism and suggests that the former has nothing "specific" and "important" to say (a rather courageous statement in view of the influence which the view has exerted over Europe and America since the time of Hegel, and in important aspects since Plato)-one can not but suspect that it may be because he has over- looked, at least in his discussion, the whole problem of the status of meanings and values. Such an evolutionary account of the de- velopment of our perception of these as he suggests, does not, of course, reach the real problem itself. The omission is a serious one, but I shall not speculate as to whether its cause may possibly be the difficulty, to which Professor Murphy called our attention, which realism, especially dualistic realism, has always encountered in deal- ing with the subject. Neither mere physical activities nor mere sen- sory awareness are equivalent to mind-quite literally certain sensing beings have lost or never possessed a mind. The chief an(d unique characteristic of the human mind, that which differentiates it as mind from other bodily functioning units, and that which gives to it particular significance not shared by such organic activities as those of respiration and digestion, is its organization as a coherent order of meanings and values. A discussion of the nature and status of mind which omits from consideration this primary characteristic is perilously like the proverbial performance of Hamlet with the Prince of Denmark missing. For it is to discuss mind without noting its basic order of activities of selection, arrangement, and classifica- tion, its mode of verification, its social implications, its whole regu- lative and legislative functioning, and that organization of interests which constitutes the structural basis of human culture. Far from making the nature and status of these clear by saying they are ac-</page><page sequence="5">THE OBJECTIVITY OF MIND 173 tivities or functions of mind, we must recognize that it is through them alone that mind is to be understood; indeed, it is in them that mind exists. If the dualistic realist is to offer us any enlightenment on the nature of mind, can he afford to ignore them? If not of them, as presenting the constitutive principles of a functional order, then of what is he speaking when he talks of mind? I can not be altogether sure from Professor Pratt's statements. This is unfortunate, for in dealing with his vigorous challenge to any belief in the objectivity of mind, there would be great gain in the assurance of a common understanding as to what, precisely, it is whose objectivity is in question. However, we are given some light on the subject-only a few rays, but very strong ones. "The neces- sities of biological evolution," Professor Pratt tells us, "have been such as obviously to develop in sentient beings symbolic perception and thought." "As a fact our knowledge of the physical is never as absolute as our knowledge of mathematics, but it meets fairly well the criterion of successful working and the possibility of prediction" (Symposium). We need not pause over historical questions to ask if the author of these words has not over-simplified the problem of origin by resort to the term "evolution" -employing it with too great a suggestion of a substantial or active agent. Nor need we delay to ask what, I suspect, might prove rather embarrassing ques- tions about that other and more "absolute" knowledge, exemplified in mathematics-a problem of extraordinary interest in its bearing on theoretical science. Our present interest is with the primary philosophical problem of mind, that of its significance, its ability to work and predict fairly successfully. How is this possible? It might be replied that this has come about by a long process of con- ditioning and adaptation through which mental activities have been shaped and developed in accord with the general order of nature. Thus, it might be held that human minds, produced by natural evo- lution, reveal the real nature of nature, and since that which they reveal is a coherent order of meanings and values, this might be taken as an expression of the natural process, and the particular mind viewed as a conscious articulation of the mind-order of the world. But we are told in no uncertain terms that such an extension of mind to nature is not to be tolerated. Natural evolution has pro- duced the individual mind in sentient beings, but its ways are not those of nature; it may respond fairly successfully to the order of external nature, but the interpretations on the basis of which the responses are made, are themselves constructed in terms of "sub- jective qualities" which are not "really objective," and, which, as "dualistic realism maintains . . . belong to the mind rather than to physical objects" (Symposium).</page><page sequence="6">174 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY "The term 'mind'," Professor Pratt insists, "should be taken in the sense commonly given it by the best English usage. According to this usage mind is essentially subjective and individual and the extension of it to the objective and impersonal is not justified." The extension objected to here is clearly that of the concept of mind and not merely the word, or Professor Pratt's whole argument for dual- ism would be meaningless. It is unfortunate that the word "essen- tially" has been introduced, somewhat blurring the meaning, for it is used so frequently as a convenient means of graceful retreat from a position. I do not think for a moment that this is the reason for its presence here, but is it a qualification, intended to suggest that while in most respects, mind is individual and subjective, yet in others it is not so? I can not think so, for this would be to let the enemy within the walls, or more accurately, to destroy the walls alto- gether at certain points, and virtually to give up the fortress within which the dualist maintains his separateness from the world. Rather, the intention probably is to strengthen the statement: essentially, and not in some superficial way, mind is individual and subjective. I have no desire to dwell on ambiguity in the statement of a position, however, and at least it is clear that the dualistic realist believes that it is the fundamental nature of mind to be individual and sub- jective. This is in harmony with Professor Pratt's statement that "mind (taken in the individual and subjective sense) is distinct from everything else in nature," but it is not so clearly consistent with another statement made in the same paper: "Dualistic realism agrees that all things are inter-related; that everything is char- acterized by its relations; and, therefore, that every physical object is in part characterized by its relations to minds" (Symposium). Perhaps this is what is meant by the "essentially" -in some minor way objects and minds are characterized by their inter-relations, but in the main, objects are independent and minds are individual and subjective. In any case, the point which I wish to suggest is that "essentially" mind is not subjective or individual, and that particu- lar human minds are minds, and not merely psychological activities, because they express through their own conscious organization, an order which is social, and even broader, which is universal. No totality can be altogether explained by analysis of its parts, for such analysis leaves out of account those characteristics which are distinctively of the whole, as such. Atomization of human ex- perience, its analysis into simpler and simpler forms, has failed to yield to the naturalist a satisfactory account of that experience on the side of those distinctive characteristics which make it what it is, that is, intelligible experience. The unique structure of the whole, no less than its constitutive contents, demands consideration.</page><page sequence="7">THE OBJECTIVITY OF MIND 175 This may be explained in terms of some more inclusive order to which it belongs, but it is never to be explained through a study of what is less inclusive. Now no one would deny that in part, our experience has a characteristic of privacy, or that conscious ac- tivities are closely related to bodily processes. But to stop with this privacy, this aspect of individualness and subjectivity, would be to leave the behavior and significance of the human mind quite unac- counted for. First, it must be noted that the human mind has a social character upon which the significance and even the existence of its subjective and individual characteristics are in large degree contingent. One need not go as far in emphasizing this social char- acter of mind as has Durkheim, or possibly even Professor Dewey, but not only has such an idealistic pragmatist as James pointed to the "compounding of consciousnesses," but also so thoroughgoing and consistent a realist as Professor Perry has pointed out that: "Two or more minds become coterminous and commutable through containing the same elements." If our methods of verification are almost entirely social, so, too, is our mode of knowledge, which is dependent on some form of inter-communication. If we meet, or seem to meet, problems which are exclusively our own, yet to them we bring habits, memories, and a whole technique of thought and action developed under social influences, within social situations, and in terms of social goals. Long ago, Heraclitus observed that it is only men asleep who live in private subjective worlds, for when they are awake, not only do they live in the same world, but they live there together. In a complementary unity with society, that which may appear individual and subjective realizes its own sig- nificance in terms of responsible human personality. Second, it must be noted that it is not alone in relationship to human society that the individual and subjective mind discovers its contingency upon an objective world, and bursts the bounds of its hypothetical isolation. This is true, also, in relationship to ex- ternal nature. For none of us is "nature" merely a parade of sense-perceptions, viewed by a spectator. It is an organized realm to be known and dealt with in terms of meaningful and valuable interpretations. Our experiences of physical nature may appear successively, and in a sense seem external to one another in a tem- poral series, but any activity of thought or will with reference to them requires that they be regarded in terms of their relationships within the unified order of mind. Particular experiences or ideas could never be associated on the basis of their differences and separateness alone; all association must be based fundamentally upon a universality or identity recognized within or beneath dif- ferences. Likewise, a unity between subject and object, between</page><page sequence="8">176 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the subjective order of mind and the objective order of objects and events, must constitute the basis of cognition if there is to be knowl- edge at all. Similarly, volition relies upon harmony between pur- pose and consequence, and assumes the objective validity of its goals. "Be it noted," warns Professor Adams, "neither the hid- den meaning which nature reveals to the poet's imagination and in- sight, nor the precise mathematical relationships which she reveals to the physicist, are facts which confront us and which we literally find. We search for them, and finding them, we acquiesce and de- light in them, we recognize them as real because, in the last analysis, they greet us as the embodiments of our own meaniings, and with them and with the nature which is built up around them, we may and do have fellowship" (Idealism and the Modern Age, p. 161). Intelligible order is not confined to a small psychological island in the universe, but thus constitutes the form of the whole. It may be true, indeed, that whatever he knows of the social or of the physical realms come to the individual through the particular ac- tivities of conscious life within his own body, and possibly it could come in no other way. But the important point is not that of the vehicle of such experiences. It is that in them the individual sub- jective mind reaches out and discovers the sole meaningful activity for itself, discovers its own contingency and that which is requisite to its completeness, finds its significance in unity with what it had called objective, and, in short, realizes itself to be something which, in individual isolation, it could neither create nor find. Thus the individual mind is regarded as a functional order, expressing in conscious form the structural principles of the uni- verse, or, in Bosanquet's phrase, as a "focus" of content. It is not separated from, but the highest expression of, the order of nature. "In the appearance of consciousness and self-consciousness Nature reaps the final and supreme result, not only of all the complex adaptations of the, bodily organism, but even of its whole character as a mechanical system" (Hoernle, Idealism as a Philosophy, p. 265). Being the most highly-developed expression of the world- order which we know, it is viewed as offering the most profound insight into the nature of that order. In undeniable fact, all knowledge of the world must be attained through its organization, but this is no loss since it possesses not only the capacity to reveal what is below itself in the order of development, but also that which is to be discovered in its unique characteristics, and to be observed from no other vantage point. When the idealist speaks of the world-order as "mind," he does not refer to consciousness, but to that coherent order which, for sentient beings, is expressed in the order of conscious life. The demands of this order of mind, as we</page><page sequence="9">THE OBJECTIVITY OF MIND 177 know it, for rationality, for meaning, for value, are articulations in the language of consciousness, of an imperative which comes, not from the nature of psychological processes alone, but from the structural order of the real world by and within which those proc- esses were developed. Psychological abstraction may provide de- scriptions of simpler parts which function in the life of human minds, but no mechanistic putting together of such parts can ade- quately account for the experienced unity and system of that from which they were severed by the original abstraction. On the other hand, this system as a whole, may be explained in terms of a more inclusive order within which it functions-and in the case of human minds, the presence of contingency requires such explanation. It is from this contingency, this fragmentariness, in human minds, that error, evil, and that whole realm known as appearances, arises. Appearance, as Professor Kemp Smith remarks, "is a simplification of reality, demanded for the purposes of animal and human existence." Why Professor Murphy should think it neces- sary that the objective idealist "wabble" into subjectivism in order to admit the possibility of finite limitations, is not clear. How- ever close the organic relationship of part to whole, they are not equal. The limitations of the part are genuine characteristics of its nature as part, though they may be antagonistic to and obscure its more basic unity with the whole. To recognize these limitations, moreover, and to evaluate them as error, ignorance, and evil, is to employ a standard which reaches beyond the immediate situation to a larger order of meanings and values taken to be real. The recognition of imperfection on the part of the individual mind is an expression of its contingency upon a larger order of complete- ness and perfection. Realizing a universality and ultimacy ex- pressing itself within the limitations of its own order of meanings and values, it applies such tests as coherence, consistency, and worth to particular experiences, justifying them as real, or condemning them to the status of appearances. The demand of thought that its meanings and values be realized in the objective world, and the pressure of that world upon us for fuller understanding, create that restlessness of finite minds which compels their indefinite expansion. This problem of differentiating the real from the temporarily and locally apparent is the real and significant problem of knowledge. To it the idealist will devote his efforts tirelessly, refusing kindly but firmly to be distracted by invitations to solve the riddle of put- ting together in knowledge, two parts of a world artificially broken apart by an abstraction in dualistic metaphysics. Professor Pratt has insisted that objective idealism may be men- talism, or naturalism, or theism, but that it can not be itself, for</page><page sequence="10">178 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lack of "specific" and "important" points of differentiation. Quite rightly, I think, he points out a similarity in the insistence of several schools on the organic unity of the world. I have attempted in the present discussion to suggest the contingent nature of human minds as a point of difference between objective idealism and all forms of genuine dualism. Also, it has been shown that naturalism and idealism differ on the fundamental problem of the status of meanings and values. Mentalism was treated in certain differen- tiating aspects, apparently to Professor Pratt's satisfaction, in an earlier paper. Nothing, however, has been said of theism,-and only this, I think, need be said: th,eism is a term which is employed with many philosophical connotations, varying from a mere mo- nistic assertion of unity in the world to that of a despotic govern- ment of the world by an anthropomorphic Zeus. It is weighted, further, with innumerable varying and even conflicting religious implications and emotions. The idealist may or may not find cer- tain of these religious conceptions compatible with his philosophy. But I have attempted to suggest certain aspects of this philosophy without introducing a word either favorably or otherwise whose presence would certainly add confusion rather than clarity to the discussion. Unfortunately, space does not remain to consider in detail Pro- fessor Schiller's reduction of-was it twelve? -forms of idealism to humanism. Since anything which can be said in philosophy is the expression of a human activity of judgment, it follows, of course, that the idealist's belief in "the final cosmic significance of value, coherence, and systematic completeness," must be such. But not all activities of human judgment are equally satisfactory. Ideal- ism would insist upon trying to determine what it is that makes some more satisfactory than others. Its own conclusion is that this is because they express the real order of things more adequately, and that we human beings are not as ignorant as Professor Schiller thinks, for from our experience we are able to learn not a little of the actual nature of our world. Should not Professor Schiller take his own Protagorean dictum more wholeheartedly? Should he not insist that man is the measure of all things-not merely the meas- ure of what he will call good or true, but the actual measure, within the limits of his finite being, of what is genuinely and realty true and valuable in the nature of things? Professor Schiller's faith in the utility of human thought would then have a justification in reason as well as in experience (itself a rational construction)-for man would be viewed as a focus within which the order of nature receives conscious expression.
